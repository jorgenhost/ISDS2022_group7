Obama says the one department regulates salmon in freshwater and another regulates them in saltwater
","
One of President Barack Obama's big laugh lines from his State of the Union address came when he talked about fish: salmon, to be specific. Obama's set-up was a call for efficient government.

""We shouldn't just give our people a government that's more affordable. We should give them a government that's more competent and more efficient. We can't win the future with a government of the past,"" Obama said. ""We live and do business in the Information Age, but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black-and-white TV. There are 12 different agencies that deal with exports. There are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy. Then there's my favorite example: The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they're in freshwater, but the Commerce Department handles them when they're in saltwater. I hear it gets even more complicated once they're smoked.""

We didn't much doubt the example. (We'll note again that White House speech writers have weeks to research and write the address.) But it did make us curious. So we decided to check the facts behind salmon swimming across regulatory lines.

And swim they do: Most salmon are born in rivers and streams, then swim out to the ocean to become adults. Once they're full-grown, they return to the rivers and streams to breed. The technical term for this is ""anadromous.""

When fish are out in the ocean, they're regulated by the National Marine Fisheries Service, which ""predicts the status of fish stocks, ensures compliance with fisheries regulations and works to reduce wasteful fishing practices,"" according to its website. The service is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is, as Obama said, part of the U.S. Commerce Department.

When fish are in the rivers and streams, they're regulated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which focuses on the conservation and protection of fish and wildlife and their habitats. The Fish and Wildlife Service is indeed part of the Department of Interior.

When the fish is smoked, it would generally be regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates most packaged foods.

Obama might even have been underselling the complexity. A major effort in the Pacific Northwest to protect and conserve salmon in the Columbia River Basin involves a ""federal caucus"" of 10 agencies working together for that purpose, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Geological Survey, to name a few.

And while the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service claims jurisdiction over salmon, freshwater fishing is also regulated heavily by state agencies.

""It is a stretch to say that salmon in freshwater are regulated by the Interior Department,"" said Ray Hilborn, a professor at the University of Washington's School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. ""Harvest in freshwater is almost totally regulated by states, and in some case tribes,"" he said in an e-mail. ""In salt water the ocean harvest beyond 3 miles is federally regulated, but almost all the catch in the U.S. takes place in Alaska, and the state of Alaska regulates that fishery.""

""In reality, most of the things that affect salmon in freshwater are managed by dozens of agencies,"" he added.

A conservationist we spoke with said that more agencies doesn't necessarily mean more inefficiency. ""It can cut both ways. In a good sense, it can bring more resources,"" said Andrew Goode of the Atlantic Salmon Federation, a group that works to protect wild salmon. ""It can get bogged down if the agencies have different ideas on how the species should be managed.""

Finally, a spokesman with the National Fisheries Institute, which represents commercial fishers, said salmon isn't even the half of it when it comes to overlapping rules. ""There's more where that came from, unfortunately, when it comes to seafood,"" said Gavin Gibbons, a spokesman for the group. His group is particularly critical of a provision included in the 2008 farm legislation that allows the U.S. Department of Agriculture to regulate catfish. Not all fish, just catfish. He called those rules a ""a demonstrable special interest effort."" American catfish farmers asked for the new rules; they say foreign fish farmers are selling inferior products in the U.S.

Gibbons praised the National Marine Fisheries Service, though, for its work conserving fish stocks. ""They're not perfect, and there are controversies about catch shares and limits and that sort of thing,"" he said. ""But broadly speaking, they're a world-class organization in terms of sustainability""

In ruling on Obama's statement, we found that he's right about the regulatory division on salmon, with different agencies responsible for the fish when they're in freshwater versus when they're in saltwater. In fact, he leaves out a lot of detail, including the role of the states. The actual regulatory scene is even more complicated. But Fish and Wildlife in the Interior Department does have authority over fish when they're in freshwater, and the National Marine Fisheries Service in the Department of Commerce regulates them in saltwater. Because he left out some of the complexity, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/26/barack-obama/obama-says-one-department-regulates-salmon-freshwa/

Michele Bachmann repeats claim that health care bill will require 16,500 new IRS agents
","
In her Tea Party Express-sponsored rebuttal to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., repeated a line used by numerous other Republican opponents of the Democratic-backed health care law passed in 2010.

""Instead of a leaner, smarter government, we bought a bureaucracy that now tells us which light bulbs to buy and which may put 16,500 IRS agents in charge of policing President Obama's health care bill.""

We’ve previously looked at the light bulb comment and have done so again. Here we’ll scrutinize Bachmann’s claim about the IRS. 
We looked at this question when then-Rep. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., (now a senator) said in a March 21, 2010, House floor speech, ""About the only jobs created by the (health care) legislation would be at the IRS. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the IRS would need to hire over 16,000 people -- over 700 just in Illinois-- to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates of the bill.""

Let’s note right off the bat that Kirk added a few problematic details that Bachmann did not, specifically his decision to cite the CBO, the nonpartisan budget arm of Congress, as his primary source. So we’ll rate Bachmann’s statement on its own terms.

On Dec. 19, 2009, the CBO released an analysis of the Senate version of the health care bill, which ultimately became the basis for the bill that was passed by both chambers and signed into law. The CBO wrote that it had ""not completed an estimate of the discretionary costs that would be associated with the legislation,"" including the costs for the IRS and other ""federal agencies that would be responsible for implementing the provisions of the legislation.""

However, CBO did offer an estimate of the costs to the IRS for ""implementing the eligibility determination, documentation, and verification processes for premium and cost-sharing credits."" The IRS, the analysis said, ""would probably"" need to spend ""between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years.""

However, CBO did not translate that dollar range into a possible number of new hires. Instead, that task was taken up by another group -- the Republican staff of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction for taxes.

On March 18, 2010, the House Ways and Means Republicans released a report titled, ""The Wrong Prescription: Democrats’ Health Overhaul Dangerously Expands IRS Authority."" The report acknowledged that it is ""impossible to know exactly how many new employees the IRS would have to hire to enforce the individual mandate and other provisions of the Democrats’ health care bill."" Still, it uses IRS data and ""reasonable assumptions about costs and program responsibilities"" to suggest that as many as 16,500 additional ""examiners, agents and other employees"" could be needed.

The Ways and Means Republicans used the high end of CBO's cost estimate of $10 billion over 10 years.

""First, assume that the IRS budget would grow by the $10 billion that CBO indicates could be necessary. While there might be some early-year start-up costs to prepare for the added workload, most of the costs would accrue in the last six years of CBO’s ten-year budget window, when the individual mandate and other provisions, which present the bulk of the new enforcement responsibilities, take effect. Thus, for this analysis, assume that $1 billion total will be spent by the IRS in the first four years to prepare for the mandate with the spending increasing to $1.5 billion per year in each of the last six years.

""Second, in the last year for which actual IRS data is available, fiscal year 2009, the IRS employed the equivalent of 92,577 people, nearly half of whom worked directly in examinations and collections. In total, the IRS had payroll and benefit expenses of $8.371 billion, implying that costs per worker were $90,427. If the $1.5 billion in annual funds are used for the payroll and benefits of a similar mix of employees, the IRS could add more than 16,500 additional agents, auditors, examiners, and administrative support personnel to enforce large portions of the nation’s health insurance system.""

But even as it offered the 16,500 figure, the Ways and Means Republicans' report offered caveats as well.

""Some might argue that figure over-estimates the number of employees that would be hired, because it includes only payroll and benefit costs and does not include other costs that would be incurred, including office overhead,"" the report says. ""However, note that the IRS total budget in fiscal year 2009 was $11.708 billion, meaning that, when all costs are included, IRS  total spending averaged $126,474 per employee. Thus, critics of the 16,500 figure might argue that any new employees should be assumed to cost as much as the average member of the existing workforce and that the $1.5 billion per year would 'only' support hiring slightly more than 11,800 new IRS employees.""

In fact, in a footnote, the report said that ""it is likely the number would lie somewhere in between the two sets of figures. There would be some additional overhead costs for the new employees, such as computers and telephone services. But there could also be fixed costs that are not as affected by additional workers (e.g., the agency may already have extra office space so does not need to rent additional square footage for each additional worker).""

We contacted a half-dozen experts in federal human-resources issues to see if they could provide an independent critique of the report's math, but those who responded ultimately declined to either confirm or second-guess the Ways and Means Republicans' calculations, citing uncertainty about what kind of staffing would be needed. One key unknown is whether computer automation -- something in which the IRS has made a substantial investment in recent years -- could handle much of the work stemming from the health care bill, rather than employees.

For the record, the IRS itself says that it has not sorted out the employment fallout yet.

On March 25, 2010, IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman appeared at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight. At one point, Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., asked Shulman, ""You said that right now you are moving forward as far as calculations and costs and staffing needs the IRS has -- you haven't made any of those final determinations yet, have you?"" 
To that question, Shulman answered, ""That's correct.""

Ultimately, we have several problems with 16,500 figure.

• It uses the high end of the CBO estimate. The CBO estimated a cost burden of between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years. The Ways and Means Republicans' report made its calculations based only on the high end of that range. If it had used the $5 billion figure instead (or offered it side by side with the $10 billion figure) it would have worked out to 8,250 jobs.

• The Ways and Means Republicans themselves acknowledge that the figure could be less than 16,500 new jobs. Factoring overhead -- rather than just salaries and benefits -- into the equation, the Republican staff said,  would reduce the number from 16,500 new employees to 11,800. This isn't just an outside critique: this is something stated explicitly in the Ways and Means Republicans' own report. And if one uses the $5 billion CBO estimate rather than the $10 billion CBO estimate, that number could shrink to 5,900 new jobs -- substantially below the 16,500 figure.

• The Ways and Means Republican staff is not a neutral arbiter. Republicans were, and are, strongly opposed to the Democratic-backed health care law. Earlier this month, every single Republican voted to repeal the law, joined by only a handful of Democrats. So we would be more comfortable relying on a figure by an independent, nonpartisan organization.

All told, we do think it's fair to assume that the IRS will need to hire new employees, perhaps thousands, to handle the caseload from the new health care law. But even the Republican staffers who calculated the number acknowledged that 16,500 is the high end of a range that could theoretically stretch as low as 5,900 using their methodology.

The good news for Bachmann is that she took greater care than Kirk did in phrasing the statistic. Rather than simply citing the 16,500 figure, she added some cushion by saying that the bill ""may put 16,500 IRS agents"" to work. That’s enough in our book to raise the rating from Barely True, which is what we gave Kirk, to Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/26/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-repeats-claim-health-care-bill-wi/

Rep. Michele Bachmann says White House promised stimulus would keep unemployment below 8 percent
","
In her Tea Party Express-sponsored rebuttal to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., repeated an oft-used attack on the economic stimulus -- that the White House promised it would keep unemployment under 8 percent (and failed).

""Unfortunately, the president's strategy for recovery was to spend a trillion dollars on a failed stimulus program, fueled by borrowed money,"" Bachmann said. ""The White House promised us that all the spending would keep unemployment under 8 percent. Not only did that plan fail to deliver, but within three months, the national jobless rate spiked to 9.4 percent. It hasn't been lower for 20 straight months. While the government grew, we lost more than 2 million jobs.""

The claim that the White House ""promised"" the stimulus would keep unemployment under 8 percent has been a popular attack line, cited repeatedly by Fox's Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck and other conservative pundits. And we have fact-checked it twice, first in July 2009 when then House Republican Whip Eric Cantor said, ""We were promised. The president said we would keep unemployment under 8.5 percent (if the stimulus passed)"" and again when columnist George Will said something similar in July 2010.

On several occasions as the stimulus was being considered, President Obama warned that if ""dramatic action"" were not taken, the recession could linger for years, and ""the unemployment rate could reach double digits."" But we could find no instance of anyone in the administration making a public pledge along the lines of ""if we pass the stimulus, we promise unemployment will stay below 8 percent.""

Rather, the claim has its roots in a Jan. 9, 2009, report called ""The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan"" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. 
Their report projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009.

As we all know now, the unemployment rate went higher. It peaked at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and was at 9.4 percent in December.

But what we saw from the administration in January 2009 was a projection, not a promise. And it was a projection that came with heavy disclaimers.

""It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error,"" the report states. ""There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""

There's also a footnote that goes with the chart that states: ""Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action.""

The administration has acknowledged its projections were wrong.

In a July 2, 2009, interview, Romer said on Fox: ""None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January. I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated.""

Indeed, in January 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus.

So, is the fact that unemployment rose, even as the stimulus unfolded, proof that it has failed? White House officials have steadfastly maintained that the stimulus is working, that even though the unemployment rate has risen higher than projected in January 2009, it would be even worse if not for the stimulus. 
In a blog posting for the New York Times, economist Paul Krugman explained, ""There’s a baseline, which is the prediction of what the economy would have done without the stimulus, and there’s the predicted change from that baseline that is the effect of the stimulus. Clearly, the baseline was way too optimistic. But the question under discussion was how much effect relative to the baseline the stimulus was supposed to have had by now.""

That was the gist of Obama's claim in a town hall meeting on the economy in Racine, Wis., on June 30, 2010.

""Now, every economist who has looked at it has said that the recovery did its job,"" Obama said. ""It put a brake on the collapse of the economy. We avoided a Great Depression. We are now growing again. The problem is, No. 1, it’s hard to argue sometimes, things would have been a lot worse. Right? So people kind of say, yeah, but unemployment is still at 9.6. Yes, but it’s not 12 or 13, or 15.""

Obama is correct that many independent economists agree that the stimulus has created more than a million jobs and kept the unemployment rate from going even higher than it has (though in fairness, not every economist agrees with that).

But there is an inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting. And how can you ever prove that if the unemployment rate got to X percent, it would or would not have gotten a point or two higher if not for the stimulus? The implication of Bachmann's comment is that rising unemployment rates prove the stimulus didn't work. Most economists don't agree -- and argue that without the stimulus, unemployment would have been worse -- but it's difficult to empirically prove one way or the other.

The White House claimed the stimulus would improve the employment picture and applied that to the baseline for projected unemployment going forward. As Krugman said, the baseline projection turned out to be way off (most economists at the time underestimated the severity of rising unemployment). Bachmann's claim suggests Obama was offering some sort of guarantee the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had ""significant margins of error"" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is ""unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity."" In short, it was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not a take-it-to-the-bank pledge of an upper limit on unemployment. 
So we find Bachmann's claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/26/michele-bachmann/rep-michele-bachmann-says-white-house-promised-sti/
"['Small Business', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Cory Mason']","
Wisconsin state Rep. Cory Mason says Republican bill would spend $80 million for better Google searches
","
Most of us would probably hate to wake up sober in the middle of a meeting of the Wisconsin Assembly Committee on Jobs, Economy and Small Business.

But the committee proceedings on Jan. 13, 2011 so rankled one member, state Rep. Cory Mason, D-Racine, that he fired off a news release the same day.

Compared with most news releases, the headline on this one could jolt you:

""Republican bill spends $80 million for better Google searches, not job creation.""

As they sometimes say on the Internet: Whaaaa?

The headline reminded us of one we might see in The Onion, but we knew Mason wasn’t writing satire, so we set out to see what he meant. After all, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has made job creation the keystone of his administration.

The Walker-requested measure in question is Assembly Bill 7, which would give tax credits to small businesses. What ticked off Mason, a four-year state lawmaker and former union organizer, were comments about the bill made during the committee meeting by freshman Rep. John Klenke, R-Green Bay, a retired businessman.

Klenke, according to Mason, defended spending $80 million on the tax credits bill in an effort to improve how Wisconsin shows up in Google searches.

Let’s start with the $80 million part of Mason’s claim.

The measure is a Republican-sponsored bill with an estimated impact of $79.2 million over two years, but Mason is flat wrong to say it spends anything.

It’s a tax reduction, not a spending increase.

Now, what about the Google part, and that the bill is not about job creation?

Mason has a point about job creation -- but only to a point.

We rated as False a job creation claim by Walker, who had said the bill would allow businesses to create new jobs. We found the average tax credit would be $145. And some small business owners would get as little as $1.

In advancing the measure, neither Walker nor GOP leaders have said anything about improving how Wisconsin shows up in Google searches being a goal.

Mason told us he is basing his claim on comments Klenke, the freshman lawmaker, made in the committee meeting.

But we don’t have to rely on Mason’s characterization of what Klenke said. We can go to the video.

Klenke, who joined the Assembly after defeating two-term Democratic incumbent Jim Soletski in November 2010, said the bill was a way to show Wisconsin is ""open for business.""

In referencing Google, he told the committee:

""If you Google ‘business climate in the state of Wisconsin,’ you will find that the state of Wisconsin has dropped 16 spots and is now number 42 in business friendliness."" (True -- five-year drop: CEO Magazine 2010 survey)

Klenke went on to say that Wisconsin ranks among the 10 states with the highest overall tax burden (True as of 2008: Tax Foundation study); is one of the 10 states most likely to go bankrupt (Not quite -- Wisconsin in ""fiscal peril"": Pew Center 2009 report); and is one of the least attractive states for retirees (True: TopRetirements.com 2010 rankings).

""What we are trying to do,"" Klenke said about the tax credits measure, ""is change the trend.""

In an interview, Klenke told us the tax credits bill is one action the state could take to improve Wisconsin’s business climate. If more such steps are taken, people who use Google to learn about Wisconsin’s business climate will get more positive information, he said.

So, he framed it in terms of the state’s overall business trends and what people may find when they use Google for a search -- not around getting a higher-ranking on a Google search, as the news release headline suggests.

(Note: The tax credits bill was amended after it was considered by the Assembly jobs committee. The changes would make more businesses eligible for the credits, but with a smaller estimated loss -- $33.5 million per year -- in state revenue, according to a Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo.

The amended bill, which would net businesses an estimated $92 to $316 for each new job created, was approved Jan. 20, 2011 by the Joint Finance Committee and sent it to the full Assembly.)

No need to search for our conclusion. Here it is:

Mason was flat wrong when he said the tax credits bill ""spends $80 million."" The bill would not spend any money; it would reduce state revenue by nearly $80 million.

On his larger point, it does not appear the tax credits alone would create jobs. But Mason cherry picks and trivializes comments by one GOP lawmaker -- Klenke -- to suggest the aim of the tax credits is to improve Google searches.

In our analysis, Mason’s claim contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/26/cory-mason/wisconsin-state-rep-cory-mason-says-republican-bil/
"['Ohio', 'Health Care', 'William G. Batchelder']","
Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder tells a healthy tale about a Canadian premier
","
New House Speaker William G. Batchelder loves telling a good story.

With a legislative career in the Ohio House stretching back to 1968, Batchelder is well-known for his floor speeches peppered with political references and historical anecdotes from days long gone.

Therefore, it was no surprise that Batchelder’s initial speech as the 101st House Speaker on Jan. 3 tied together the Ohio legislative session of 1937-38, the Roman historian Titus Livy, a lunch meeting with Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as well as the 1787 comments of Ben Franklin upon wrapping up the Constitutional Convention.

After describing the challenges facing Ohio, the Medina Republican’s speech took a sunny turn as he mentioned the medical services in Ohio ""that are second to none."" In illustrating this point, Batchelder mentioned that the king of Saudi Arabia as well as a top Canadian official had sought treatment in Ohio.

""The Canadian provincial prime minister came to Ohio for his medical treatment because of the delay in Canadian health care which would have endangered his life,"" Batchelder said. Beyond suggesting that Ohio medical treatment was first-class, Batchelder was also making a political point in suggesting that Canada’s universal health care system is second-rate.  

While the Cleveland Clinic’s care for Saudi royalty is well-known, Batchelder’s Canadian anecdote caught us by surprise. It seemed to us that if one of Canada’s premiers (as the top provincial leaders are known) had come to Ohio for medical care that it would have been a big deal, but it just didn’t sound familiar. So we put on our Politifact hardhat, and began digging.

We first called Batchelder spokesman Mike Dittoe to find out more about where the claim originated. Dittoe told us that Batchelder personally inserted the reference into his Jan. 3rd speech, but didn’t have more details.

Eventually, Dittoe got back to us that Batchelder told him ""it’s on the tip of my tongue"" but couldn’t quite recall the name.  

However, Dittoe said it was not former Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams, who traveled to Miami in February 2010 for open heart surgery. It was the leader of one of the  western provinces, according to Batchelder.

Later, Dittoe reversed himself in an e-mail and wrote that it was Williams that Batchelder was referring to in his speech. He said that it had been ""widely speculated"" that Williams came to the Cleveland Clinic for ""post-operative medical treatment"" following his surgery in Florida. But, Dittoe acknowledged, there is no way to know for sure because HIPAA rules prevent the sharing of information of when a patient visits a doctor.

Initially told to look west by Batchelder, we searched Canadian newspapers in the national capital of Ottawa and eight provincial and territory capitols from Ontario on westward and northward (Toronto, Winnipeg, Regina, Edmonton, Victoria, White Horse, Yellow Knife and Iqaluit for all you geography nerds) for references to a provincial premier getting health care treatment.

During our search, we learned that Yukon Premier Dennis Fentie had cancerous tumors removed in 2007— in Vancouver. And we found out that former Ontario Premier Ernie Eves had emergency heart bypass surgery several years ago — in Toronto.

But there were a whole raft of stories about Williams, who resigned his office in December. His February 2010 trip to Miami for specialized heart surgery was big news — and a public relations disaster up north — in all of the major Canadian newspapers. The initial stories didn’t say where Williams was getting treatment, but afterward news trickled out that it had taken place in Miami.

Williams told the press that the health care treatment in Miami was better, and that he knew he would be criticized or perceived as a line-jumper if he stayed in Canada, where the special surgery has a waiting list. Not the same thing as saying your life is endangered by the Canadian health care system, but in the ballpark.

More importantly, we didn’t find even find any references to any Canadian officials heading to Ohio for medical treatment. Much less for medical treatment that saved their life that was endangered because of delays in the Canadian system. As far as the Canadian press is concerned, a provincial premier has never come to the Buckeye State for medical treatment.

Just to double-check on whether Williams had an Ohio stop for medical treatment, we called the St. John’s Telegram, the daily newspaper in the provincial capital. We spoke to Dave Bartlett, a reporter who interviewed Williams following the February 2010 heart surgery.

""I’m fairly confident he never came to Ohio for any kind of treatment,"" Bartlett said. ""My understanding is that he stayed in Florida for several weeks after the surgery and then he went to the Vancouver Olympics.""

So let’s take a look at what we’ve got cooking here: 

The Williams surgery in the United States was big news and it was initially unclear where in this country he was going for treatment. But by the time Batchelder made his speech in the House, it was 11 months after Williams had his surgery.

Batchelder, as speaker of the House, is in a position of authority that also carries great responsibility. When he speaks, people listen.

Yet neither he nor his office could point us to any concrete evidence that a high level provincial official came to Ohio for treatment. And given that the best they could come up with was that it was ""widely speculated"" that Williams might have come to Cleveland, the claim is more than just inaccurate; it’s ridiculous to a point that we’re ready to set the good speaker’s double-knits ablaze.

We rate Batchelder’s claim Pants on Fire.

Mario Gallegos says right now, 98,184 Texas motorists are legally driving without licenses showing their photos
","
A Democratic state senator warned Tuesday that a Republican-sought mandate requiring Texas voters to present photo IDs at the polls could leave nearly 100,000 drivers unable to cast ballots.

Sen. Mario Gallegos of Houston specified that 98,184 residents ""are driving with this paper right here,"" waving a sheet of paper we took to be a state form, and without a license featuring their photo. His point: Such Texans would be prevented from voting if the legislation before the Senate passes into law.

Gallegos’ statement came up as he pressed Republican senators to speak to how the proposal would affect drivers who relinquish their licenses to law enforcement officers and are then given temporary licenses.

""I’ve known some folks that have had their licenses pulled and have not gone through the process, and there’s no photo ID. All they’re given is the sheet of paper that I have right here, that they’re driving with,"" Gallegos said. ""98,184 that are driving with this paper right here, no photo ID.""

Sen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands, replied that the issue needs clearing up.

We reached Gallegos’ legislative director, Debra Gonzales, who shared information she attributed to the Texas Department of Public Safety stating that in 2010, 98,184 people were arrested for violating provisions of the Texas Transportation Code related to operating a motor vehicle or watercraft under the influence of alcohol. Section 524.011 of the code says the officer shall issue a temporary driving permit ""unless department records show or the officer otherwise determines that the person does not hold a driver’s license to operate a motor vehicle"" in Texas. The 2010 number is down from the recent high of 103,155, set in 2007, according to the information.

Gonzales forwarded a copy of the form for the temporary permit, which says: ""If your Texas driver license was confiscated, this document will serve as your temporary driving permit... This permit is valid for 40 days from the date of service,"" meaning the date the original license was taken away. If a driver seeks a hearing, though, the temporary permit remains valid until a judge makes a final decision in their case.

Next, we contacted the DPS. Spokesman Tom Vinger said that once a detained driver is moved to a police station or sheriff’s office, he or she is asked to take a chemical test measuring blood alcohol concentration.The officer tells the driver their license will be suspended if they refuse to take the test or fail it. The officer also confiscates the original license and issues a temporary driving permit.

In an e-mail, Vinger said that 98,184 people were arrested for driving while intoxicated during 2010. He cautioned, though, that not all of the drivers ended up with temporary licenses.

Vinger also noted that a driver who has had their license confiscated due to a DWI arrest remains eligible for a Texas-issued identification card, which includes a photograph. The six-year cards typically cost $16, he said.

Gonzales, Gallegos’ aide, later agreed that arrested individuals could obtain state photo IDs, potentially satisfying the proposed voter ID law, though she said doing so might involve hassles. The bigger point, she said by e-mail, is ""that out of 100,000 people per year that get arrested for DWIs,"" the voter ID proposal is ""bound to negatively impact one as a voter, disenfranchising them. And if one is affected, then it’s one too many.""

Our sense: Gallegos’ statement incorrectly assumes everyone arrested for DWI during 2010 not only received a temporary license when arrested but is currently driving with such a license. DPS did not pinpoint the number of current drivers with temporary permits. Also, affected individuals can get other state-issued photo IDs.

Paul Ryan, in State of the Union response, says U.S. debt will soon eclipse GDP
","
In his response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., warned that government spending has reached a tipping point.

""We face a crushing burden of debt,"" Ryan said. ""The debt will soon eclipse our entire economy and grow to catastrophic levels in years ahead.""

We at PolitiFact and our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio have both considered essentially identical claims from House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.

The most recent of those statements, which came during a speech in the House of Representatives on Jan. 5, 2011, was that ""our spending has caught up with us, and our debt soon will eclipse the entire size of our national economy.""

In its most basic interpretation, the United States government’s total debt at the start of the year was $14 trillion, according to the Treasury Department’s interactive ""Debt to the Penny"" website.

The size of the United States economy, measured by the gross domestic product, or the value of all goods and services, was $14.745 trillion in the third quarter of 2010, the most recent quarter for which data is available. This number comes from the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis databases.

Using these numbers, it would appear that the eclipse is about to start. But since GDP estimates are not as current as the debt numbers, we wanted to see how big the debt was at the end of the third quarter of 2010. Going back to Treasury’s calculator, we got a debt figure of $13.668 trillion by putting the date at Oct. 31, 2010. That means $13.6 trillion in debt against a $14.7 trillion economy, which to us signals the onset of an eclipse.

Economists and analysts who are reading this by now are shouting, ""Wait!"" We understand.

There is an alternative measure of debt known as ""public debt,"" which does not include money in the Social Security trust fund or other amounts that the government owes itself. Using this measure instead, the debt-to-GDP comparisons are much smaller. By the end of 2010, public debt is projected to be 60.3 percent of GDP, and by the end of 2012, it's projected to be 66.6 percent. If current practices aren’t changed, public debt will reach 90 percent of GDP in 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office, whose figures were cited by President Barack Obama’s national Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in December.

Some economists prefer to use public debt rather than gross federal debt, because the public debt will require real money to repay the lenders, which in turn would have a faster ripple effect in the private sector. But one measure ""isn’t more 'right' than the other,"" Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road budget-hawk group, told us last March. ""Boehner may be cherry-picking, but I don’t think he’s misrepresenting in any way.""

Even if the smaller number -- public debt -- were to approach a total eclipse in a decade, ""to me, that counts as 'soon,'"" said Brian Riedl, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. That’s because it can take five to 10 years for congressional decisions ""to turn the budget ship around,"" he said.

We'll note that these numbers have been growing for decades, roughly tripling since Jimmy Carter left the presidency. Under Ronald Reagan, debt as a percentage of GDP grew from 33.4 percent to 51.9 percent, and under George H.W. Bush, it grew from 51.9 percent to 64.1 percent. It declined under Bill Clinton, from 64.1 percent to 57.3 percent, before rising from 57.3 percent to 69.2 percent under George W. Bush. It's expected to soar during Obama's first four years from 69.2 percent to 100.8 percent.

We'll also note that these numbers could change over the course of the next two years, depending on economic conditions and policy choices. Still, we considered Boehner's statistics valid, and Ryan's formulation is equally solid. So we rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/26/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-state-union-response-says-us-debt-will-s/

Barack Obama in State of the Union says U.S. corporate tax rate is among world's highest
","
In his State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama brought up the idea of simplifying the tax code.

""Over the years,"" he said, ""a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries. Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all. But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and it has to change.""

In noting the nation’s high corporate tax rates, Obama offered a statistic that is more often raised by Republicans. But is it right?

We checked this fact before, when it was offered by newly elected Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa.

On the Jan. 2, 2011, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, host David Gregory asked Toomey for areas where Obama and congressional Republicans could work together.

""I think tax policy is a possible area, one with plenty of landmines but plenty of opportunities,"" Toomey said. ""Simplify the code, lower rates. We should be lowering corporate tax rates, because we have the highest in the world right now.""

Using the most straightforward definition of ""corporate tax rates,"" Toomey is right. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 32 large, industrialized democracies, ranks the ""combined corporate income tax rate"" in its member nations. That means the highest tax bracket for general corporate income, excluding taxes levied on specific products or services.

We found that for 2010, the U.S ranked second to Japan by a fraction of a percentage point -- 39.54 percent for Japan to 39.21 percent for the U.S. But that figure is already outdated: Japan has moved to cut its rate for 2011 by 5 percentage points, leaving the U.S. with the highest corporate tax rate among OECD nations.

Still, the issue is complicated, so let’s delve a bit deeper.

The OECD rate is the ""statutory"" rate -- that is, the top corporate tax rate on the books. But as Obama indicated, many companies pay considerably less than that, due to deductions and other exclusions. Adjusting for these factors produces a statistic called the ""effective tax rate.""

The World Bank has assembled data from 183 nations and made a series of statistical adjustments to produce a full international comparison of effective tax rates. By this measurement, the U.S. rate is considerably lower than the published rate -- 27.6 percent. But in a comparative sense, that's still pretty high: Among larger international economies, only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand imposed a higher effective rate, according to the World Bank study. And Japan's number should fall by the time next year's study comes out.

The World Bank also produces another -- and broader -- statistic. This measure factors in not only the corporate profit tax but also a range of other taxes paid by businesses, including the cost of employee taxes borne by the employer. When the World Bank ranked countries from the lowest level of taxes to the highest, the U.S. ranked 124th out of 183 -- meaning corporate taxes were relatively high. A number of other large and/or democratic countries were higher, including Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Spain and Sweden.

This last measure provides a wider snapshot of U.S. tax policy toward businesses, but it also introduces some complications. Factoring in the employer-paid portion of labor taxes makes the corporate tax rate seem higher in countries that provide higher benefits such as pensions or health care through business taxes, while making the rate seem lower for countries that provide less generous benefits through the tax code. So making apples-to-apples comparisons can be tricky.

There's also broader context that Toomey doesn't get into. In a previous item, we noted that when all taxes, including those such as personal income taxes and property taxes -- not just corporate taxes -- are taken into account and compared to gross domestic product, the U.S. doesn't rank near the top of the OECD table in total tax burden.

Taking into account these complexities, we rated Toomey’s comment Mostly True. Obama’s statement is actually more accurate than Toomey’s, because he hedges a bit by saying that the United States has ""one of"" the highest corporate tax rates in the world. He's right that the U.S. does now have the highest corporate tax rates on the books, at least among the biggest industrialized democracies, which is most economists' typical yardstick. And U.S. tax rates also are among the biggest by more nuanced measures. So we rate Obama’s statement True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/26/barack-obama/barack-obama-state-union-says-us-corporate-tax-rat/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Barack Obama']","
Ten years of deficits? Even more than that
","
One of the themes of President Barack Obama's State of the Union address was the need to take control of the national budget.

""Now, the final step – a critical step – in winning the future is to make sure we aren't buried under a mountain of debt,"" Obama said. ""We are living with a legacy of deficit-spending that began almost a decade ago. And in the wake of the financial crisis, some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing, save jobs, and put money in people's pockets. But now that the worst of the recession is over, we have to confront the fact that our government spends more than it takes in. That is not sustainable. Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means. They deserve a government that does the same.""

His comment had a partisan undertone. By saying deficit spending began almost a decade ago, he is referring to the presidency of George W. Bush. We wanted to review the history of deficit spending and put Obama's statement in a bit of perspective.

To do that, we turned to the historical tables on the federal budget published by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Obama said that deficit spending ""began almost a decade ago."" The historical data shows that from 2009 to 2002, the country did indeed run deficits. There's no doubt once the 2010 numbers are fully compiled, they too will show a deficit.

You have to go back to the time of President Bill Clinton, working with a Republican Congress, to find budget surpluses. The historical tables show surpluses for the years 1998 to 2001.

But the nation's debt did not begin under President Bush. The historical data show the government ran deficits from at least 1970 to 1998. (The CBO's most recent summary of historical data only goes back to 1970.) So that includes deficits under Republicans Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, as well as Democrats Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton (for much of his presidency).

So Obama isn't telling the full story by saying the legacy of deficit spending began a decade ago. It goes back even farther than that.

We should point out that deficits are not the same thing as government debt. When the government spends more than it takes in during a single year, that's a deficit. Add up the deficits over many years, minus any surpluses, and you get the public debt. So even when there were surpluses under the Clinton administration, there was still significant public debt. But the surpluses meant that the overall debt was getting smaller.

There's one caveat to Obama's statement. Deficits started again 2002, at $157.8 billion that year. They got a bigger after that, hitting $412.7 billion in 2004, but started shrinking again in 2005. The recession hit in 2008, and the deficit ticked up to $458.6 billion. But thanks to the stimulus and a deepening recession, the deficit got much bigger in 2009 -- it hit $1.414 trillion in 2009, according to the CBO statistics.

And to get even wonkier, you can look at deficits as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product, a metric that accounts for inflation and economic growth. (The Gross Domestic Product is a measurement of the size of the entire U.S. economy.) If you look at it this way, the 2009 deficit is the largest since at least 1970, at 9.9 percent. The next largest deficit was in 1983, when it was 6.6 percent. 
Obama is correct that there was a turning point toward deficit spending a decade ago. But he isn't telling the full story of the nation's deficits, a ""legacy"" that began long before George W. Bush was president. We rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/26/barack-obama/ten-years-deficits-even-more/

Barack Obama in State of the Union says up to a quarter of U.S. high schoolers drop out
","
In his State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama advocated investments in both physical and human capital. But he said the nation’s rates of educational achievement were falling short.

""Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school degree,"" Obama said. ""And yet, as many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school.""

We looked at this question last year, when Education Secretary Arne Duncan offered a similar statistic on the Aug 29, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour during a discussion of education policy.

""In this country, we have a 25 percent dropout rate,"" he said. ""That's 1.2 million students leaving our schools for the streets every single year. That is economically unsustainable, and that is morally unacceptable.""

We wondered whether it was really true that one of every four American high school students drops out before graduating. We concluded that while Duncan used a commonly cited statistic, education experts we contacted cautioned that it's an imperfect measurement.

First, a bit about the complex world of measuring dropout rates, drawing liberally from a prior article by our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas.

Researchers and governments have many different ways of measuring how many students leave school before graduating. ""A dropout rate seems like it should be the most intuitive thing in the world, but it’s not,"" said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education who specializes in comparative statistics. ""There are almost as many ways of calculating state dropout rates as there are states.""

One way to calculate it is to track individual students as they progress from freshman year of high school until graduation. This provides the most accurate data, but tracking students this way requires a lot of effort, so many school districts do not do it.

The main alternative is to track the decline in enrollment between freshman year and graduation. This is known as the AFGR, or averaged freshman graduation rate. It's much easier to do -- and it's the most consistent ""apples to apples"" statistic across the 50 states -- but it is undermined by a greater risk of error.

That's because AFGR does not necessarily distinguish between students who actually dropped out and those who left for other reasons, such as moving to a school in another state, leaving to follow one's parents to a new military assignment, graduating early or graduating late.  ""If a kid leaves one school but is never tracked if he enrolls in another school, that can count as a dropout,"" Bills said. ""Also, a lot of kids who leave high school but later get GEDs are often counted as dropouts. And sometimes dropout rates are calculated as the number of people aged 16-24 not in school and without a degree, which can also inflate the number.""

Students who leave for other reasons can be excluded, but this is not always done, and not doing it tends to inflate the apparent number of dropouts. Standardization mandated by provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act has reduced these errors over time, but the statistics are not yet perfect, our experts said.

And, needless to say, analyzing different data with different methods will inevitably yield varying results. To add to the confusion, any of the measurements cited above might be termed the ""dropout"" rate in public discourse.

At the Education Department, we spoke to Tracy Dell'Angela, director of outreach and communications with the Institute of Education Sciences, which oversees the department's National Center for Education Statistics, which among other things calculates AFGR. She said that when Duncan talks about the dropout rate, he tends to subtract the AFGR (nearly 75 percent for the last available year, 2007-2008) from a full student universe of 100 percent to get a 25 percent dropout rate.

In one sense, Duncan was on solid ground -- his calculation is certainly a common way to use the statistics. But the numbers require some important caveats. In addition to the issue of transfer students cited earlier, the statistics do not necessarily treat home schoolers accurately (they may be counted as dropouts if they begin home schooling after 9th grade and eventually graduate from home school). In addition, Education Department data has sometimes left out entire states, including South Carolina in 2007-2008.

Also, the AFGR statistics only refer to public school students. In fact, there is no comprehensive data on graduation and dropout rates from private schools, which account for about 8 to 9 percent of high school students. Since parents paying tuition are likely to be especially motivated to see their children finish school, the true national dropout rate reported probably overstates the actual percentage of American children failing to graduate from high school.

We ended up rating Duncan’s comment Half True, noting that while we understood the need for simplicity in a televised interview, Duncan could have easily said the dropout rate ""may be as high as 25 percent.""

In fact, Obama in his State of the Union address did essentially that, prefacing the statistic by saying that ""as many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school."" We still think the 25 percent statistic is undermined by a variety of problems, but we give Obama credit for offering a range. So we find his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/26/barack-obama/barack-obama-state-union-says-quarter-us-high-scho/

Barack Obama in State of the Union says corporate profits are up over the past two years
","
In his State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama suggested that the economy is in recovery mode.

""We are poised for progress,"" the president told a joint session of Congress. ""Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back. Corporate profits are up. The economy is growing again.""

We decided to see if corporate profits are indeed up in the past two years.

Statistics on corporate profits are calculated by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. They are determined both on an annual and a quarterly basis.

According to BEA, corporate profits -- officially known as ""corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments"" -- were as follows:

2007: $1.511 trillion
2008: $1.263 trillion
2009: $1.258 trillion

Unfortunately, since we’re only 25 days into 2011, BEA has yet not calculated the figure for 2010, so we’re left to use annualized estimates based on the quarterly figures.

The most recent quarterly estimate, based on the third quarter of 2010, produced annualized corporate profits of $1.659 trillion. Even the lowest annualized estimate for corporate profits, based on the first quarter of 2010, pegged them at $1.567 trillion -- still well above either of the full-year amounts for 2008 and 2009.

So, the only thing that could make Obama’s statement incorrect would be a woeful under performance in the fourth quarter of 2010, but that seems unlikely based on current expert estimates.

Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1.8 billion at Platypus Asset Management in Sydney, told Bloomberg Businessweek in mid-January that ""the earnings recovery in the U.S. has been exceptional post-crisis. It seems the recovery in the U.S. economy is starting to broaden, which will support revenue and earnings growth. China’s economy is robust, but it’ll take at least six months of strong data to silence those calling a policy-induced hard landing.""

Indeed, if the third-quarter rate holds, corporate profits for 2010 would set a record. The current record was set in 2006 -- the last full year before the onset of the recent recession. That year, corporate profits hit $1.608 trillion.

Of course, corporate profits are just one component of the economy -- and just one part of Americans’ perceptions of how well the nation is doing economically. Unemployment is still stubbornly high, and indeed, some commentators have been critical of companies’ hesitancy to invest on new hires amid such high profits.

Still, Obama was correct in his description of the trend in corporate profits. One could say that he’s being presumptuous by assuming what the full 2010 figure will be before it’s officially announced, but we think that the current trendlines for corporate profits, combined with recent fourth-quarter reports, put the level so far above the 2009 level that it’s highly unlikely to drop once the full-year numbers have been released. So we rate Obama’s statement True.

What's killing inmates on Florida's death row?
","
House Speaker Dean Cannon thinks the Florida court system overstepped its authority last year when it removed three Constitutional amendment questions from the statewide ballot. 
So, in 2011, he's talking about ""comprehensive court reform.""

Addressing a group of nearly 50 reporters and editors at the annual pre-session meeting organized by the Associated Press, Cannon again made his case that the court system should not have removed constitutional amendments that, if approved by voters, would have granted tax breaks for first-time home buyers and affected state redistricting. A third amendment was drafted in response to the new federal health care law to prohibit Florida from participating in any health insurance exchange that compels people to buy insurance.

All three amendments were stripped from the ballot after judges ruled that the attached ballot language was either flawed or misleading.

Cannon said he will propose legislative changes to effectively remove or diminish judicial review of ballot questions.

But that's not all.

""Florida's judicial system has the authority to take away not only a person's liberty, but also a person's life. Understanding the severity and irreversible nature of that penalty, we have a responsibility to ensure that justice is administered not only fairly, but also efficiently,"" Cannon said. ""Criminal cases are complex in nature and in recent years we've seen cases overturned, and there have been errors. The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed. Significant and unreasonable delays plague the current process of conducting state post-conviction review in these cases and it appears that there is little the Supreme Court can do to improve or streamline the process.""

Cannon said that is where the Legislature can step in.

""I believe the Legislature can and should work with the judicial branch to significantly improve the administration of justice in death penalty cases,"" he said. ""I am hopeful that reform could lead to a more equitable judicial system for all Floridians, and as we move forward toward the 2011 legislative session, we will continue to explore this issue to determine when and what the right course of action for Florida may be.""

Cannon hasn't specified what court reform legislation might look like, though by his comments it sure sounds like he wants the appeals process in death row cases hastened. In that vein, we decided to check his facts about Florida's death row, focusing on this claim: ""The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed.""

Of the 392 people now on Florida's death row, House records indicate that 145 inmates have been there for 20 years or longer and 34 have been there for 30 years or more, according to Cannon spokeswoman Katie Betta.

Gary Alvord has been on Florida's death row since April 1974, according to the Florida Department of Corrections. Alvord escaped a Michigan mental hospital and wound up in Tampa, where he killed three women. Alvord, who turned 64 on Jan. 10, 2011, has been on death row for more than 13,400 days. This April, he will have been awaiting execution for 37 years.

John Vining, who was sentenced to death in 1990, is the oldest person on death row. On March 13, 2011, he will turn 80. Vining was convicted of shooting and killing a woman who was trying to sell him a $60,000 diamond.

Since Florida reinstated the death penalty in 1976 (and began carrying out sentences in 1979), 69 people have been executed -- a rate of a little over two per year. One reason, for starters, is a lengthy and costly appeals process. But politics plays a role as well. The governor must sign a death warrant for an execution to proceed.

And sometimes other complicating factors are cited. Alvord, for instance, has a long history of mental illness and has been declared mentally incompetent by several courts.

The last person to be executed in Florida was Martin Grossman in February 2010. Grossman was convicted of shooting a Pinellas County wildlife officer who happened upon Grossman shooting a stolen handgun in a wooded area.

Gov. Charlie Crist signed the death warrant of David Eugene Johnston in 2010 as well, but Johnston died while awaiting his sentence. He was convicted of stabbing an 84-year-old Orlando woman to death in 1983.

That transitions naturally to Cannon's claim.

The Florida Department of Corrections provided PolitiFact Florida with a list of 55 inmates who died on death row starting Jan. 1, 2000. Thirty of the 55 somehow died while awaiting their sentence (the state does not describe the nature of a person's death), and 25 were executed.

For example, Eddie Lee Sexton Sr. died on Dec. 29, 2010, while living on death row. Sexton was convicted of murder after a jury found that he ordered his mentally impaired son to strangle Sexton's son-in-law at a Florida park. Sexton feared that the son-in-law was going to report family abuses to local authorities, prosecutors said. Sexton was sentenced to death in 1998.

Robert Power died on Dec. 3, 2010, while awaiting sentence for the rape and murder of a 12-year-old Orange County girl. Power had been on death row for 20 years. 
The waiting and appeals process certainly comes with additional cost. The Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington policy group that does not advocate for or against the death penalty, published a 2009 report discussing the cost of enforcing the death penalty. The group cited a 2000 Palm Beach Post analysis, which said that the state spends $51 million a year enforcing the death penalty. That's $51 million a year more than it would cost to punish all first-degree murderers with life in prison instead. The figure has been repeated by several other news publications as well as Rex Dimmig, chief assistant public defender of the 10th Judicial Circuit, in testimony before a state Senate committee discussing the death penalty.

Make no mistake, the death penalty is a controversial and complex policy issue. But here, we're focusing on Cannon's call for reforms based on death row inmate data. He said: ""The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed."" He's right. Of the 55 death row inmates to die since Jan. 1, 2000, only 25 actually were executed. We rate this statement True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/25/dean-cannon/whats-killing-inmates-floridas-death-row/

U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy ignores the ""replace"" part of his pledge on health care reform
","
As a Republican running in a traditionally Democratic district, one held for decades by U.S. Rep. Dave Obey, Sean Duffy staked out a more moderate position on federal health reforms than many other GOP candidates.

Duffy told voters he was for ""reforming the reform"" or ""immediately repealing and replacing"" the Democratic Party-backed changes signed into law by President Barack Obama.

Unlike many Republicans, Duffy did not back a straight repeal. He said the bill overall was too costly and would fail at clamping down costs, but it contained ""a lot of good things"" -- guaranteed health insurance for millions with pre-existing conditions, for one.

Here is how he laid out his ""repeal and replace"" approach at an Oct. 26, 2010 debate in Wausau:

""So I would support either reforming the reform, or if we had a bill that was going to work, repeal and replace.""

Newspapers in the district took notice.

The Marshfield News Herald wrote that Duffy said he ""would not vote to repeal the legislation unless a better proposal was in place.""

The Wausau Daily Herald, in endorsing Duffy, said the former district attorney ""hasn't beaten the drum for repeal of health care reform.""

That was on the campaign trail.

Early in the new Congress, the GOP-led House scheduled a repeal vote on the federal health care reforms -- which many of its candidates had derisively dubbed ""ObamaCare.""

Duffy was concerned.

""I found it unacceptable we could have a repeal vote without having something to put on the table,"" Duffy told reporters the day of the vote, Jan. 19, 2011. National political writers said he faced a dilemma on the vote, given his campaign statements.

But he ultimately voted with other Republicans to repeal the law, without any alternatives in place. The measure is not likely to clear the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Did Duffy’s vote constitute a reversal of position?

Given the importance of the legislation, and the prominence of the issue in Duffy’s campaign, we decided to put it to the Flip-O-Meter.

Here’s our requisite reminder: We’re not evaluating whether the change was good (or bad) politics or policy, just whether it amounts to a change in position as Duffy’s critics claim.

A key in evaluating how this played out is recalling Duffy’s comments that clearly stated he wanted an attractive alternative developed in conjunction with a repeal vote. He said he would vote yes on repeal ""if we had a bill that was going to work.""

Wisconsin reporters had that comment and similar Duffy remarks in mind the day after the vote. Duffy found himself moving to head off the impression he broke a promise.

The Daily Herald described it this way: ""Duffy, who pledged during his campaign not to repeal the plan until Republicans presented an alternative, said his vote was the first step toward that goal.""

The ""first step"" Duffy described was a House vote the next day on a measure instructing committees to draft replacement legislation along certain Republican-favored general principles. Duffy joined in the majority vote on that. House leaders set no timetable for that process.

In any case, it was not in place when Duffy voted for repeal.

To be sure, the quick vote on repeal put Duffy in an awkward spot.

Duffy posted a message on his congressional website noting that ""some have criticized my vote as a contradiction of what I campaigned on because an alternative measure was not immediately in place."" He argued waiting to build a replacement avoided a one-party solution that would have cut out Democrats.

Duffy press secretary Daniel Son offered several other points:

He said you need repeal before you can begin to replace, because Democrats would have little motivation to join in if the law was still on the books. Duffy, he noted, did not decide to schedule the vote now -- Republican House leaders did.

While those may be good points, they do not get at the central position Duffy took during the campaign.

When running, Duffy used very specific language to convey his position on federal health reforms, saying he would not vote for repeal unless ""a better proposal was in place"" or ""we had a bill that was going to work.""

He voted for the repeal, without a new proposal in place. Indeed, no such bill exists yet. It’s unclear what will be in a Republican alternative, when it will be voted on, and whether it will satisfy Duffy’s interest in saving the ""good things"" in the legislation.

Can Rick Baker thank the weather for leaving office without a sewage crisis?
","St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman has deflected some blame for the city’s sewage problem onto Mother Nature, saying opponent and former Mayor Rick Baker had an easier time avoiding sewage spills because he didn’t face as much severe rain. The sewage crisis has become the central issue of the Aug. 29 primary election, exacerbated by the 2015 closure of the Albert Whitted Water Reclamation Facility on the downtown waterfront. The decision to close the plant was made by City Council in 2011 and carried out in 2015 by the Kriseman administration. Since the plant’s closure, the city has been whipped by severe storms, prompting the release of millions of gallons of sewage into the bay. A Tampa Bay Times story in June uncovered a large disparity in the amount of sewage spilled during Baker’s two terms and Kriseman’s first. About 1.5 million gallons spilled under Baker in nine years, and 186 million gallons spilled under Kriseman through the 2015-16 summers. Kriseman acknowledged the difference but argued Baker benefited from better weather conditions. ""Clearly, there is no comparison in the numbers,"" Kriseman told the Times in June. ""But we also had wet weather events that he did not experience. He went through significant periods of drought during his time as mayor. ""When you don't have significant rain events, and you're still having spills, you still need to take a look at your system."" In the weeks since that interview, Kriseman has accepted responsibility for his response to the sewage crisis. We were still intrigued by Kriseman’s explanation to the reporter. So we checked out whether it really did rain more under Kriseman, whether there was more drought under Baker, and what effect the weather really played in the system spilling nearly 124 times more under Kriseman than Baker. After consulting climatologists and the campaigns, here’s what we found out: The rainfall under Kriseman was only slightly worse than under Baker. Most importantly, Kriseman’s claim overlooks the consequence of his own decisionmaking and its connection to millions of gallons of spilled sewage. The average annual rainfall at Albert Whitted Airport was higher during Kriseman’s term, but not by as much as he made it sound. According to data compiled by the National Weather Service, from 2001-09 the average annual rainfall at Albert Whitted airport was about 45.4 inches. The average rainfall under Kriseman’s three years was about 53.74 inches. Average rainfall can be useful to understand part of the story. But excessive rain events (such as high flooding, tropical storms and hurricanes) are also relevant to consider, said Dustin Norman with the National Weather Service, given the underlying issue of sewage capacity. ""If you get an inch and a half a day for 30 days that’s way different than 40 inches in one day,"" Norman said. The city has been hit with several big storms since 2015 when the first major spill of Kriseman’s tenure occurred. In 2015, nearly 15 inches of rain fell between mid July and early August, causing the city to release 31.5 million gallons of untreated and partially treated sewage.   Tropical Storm Colin hit the next summer, leading to 10 million gallons being dumped or spilled in June 2016. The worst event for the sewer system was Hurricane Hermine, which swamped aging sewer pipes in 2016 with 8.1 inches of rain. St. Petersburg reported spilling at least 151 million gallons of sewage as a result of Hermine — officials were unable to give a more exact tally because of a broken flow meter. Four hurricanes struck Florida in 2004. Tampa Bay avoided a direct hit but received a large amount of rainfall. The Tampa-St. Petersburg area got 12 to 14 inches of rain in August 2004, which experts said was notably high. ""The first part of (Kriseman's) statement, that ‘we had wet wet periods he did not experience,’ may be an overstatement,"" said David Zierden, a state climatologist at the Florida Climate Center at Florida State University. ""I do know that August of 2004 was very wet, with the Tampa-St. Pete getting 12-14 inches that month."" Since that is considered high, we wanted to know the typical monthly rainfall total for the Albert Whitted Airport and how many times a month exceeded it. Daniel Brouillette, a climate services specialist at Florida State University, helped us out by compiling monthly rainfall totals from the airport from January 1987 to December 2016. He considered any monthly total that was more than two standard deviations greater than the mean monthly total — 11.14 inches of rain — as ""extremely wet."" Under Kriseman, five of his 43 months in office exceeded the mean of 11.14 inches (about 11.6 percent of his months). Under Baker, eight of his 105 months in office (or about 7.6 percent) exceeded the mean.   So Kriseman experienced a greater percentage of ""extremely wet"" months, but not dramatically so. The Tampa Bay Times obtained a draft report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission last month that places much of the blame for the city's 200-million gallon sewage spill crisis on the administration of Kriseman, as well as the past two decades of city leadership, which includes the Baker administration from 2001-10. In particular, it pointed to the closure of the Albert Whitted plant in April 2015 and the Kriseman’s failure to reopen the plant to alleviate the sewage crisis after the heavy rains of August 2015. Kriseman and his team have described the rain events of 2015 as ""historic,"" ""unprecedented"" or a ""100-year event."" But investigators said those descriptions ""were not based in fact or reality,"" as the amount of rainfall Pinellas received in 2015 happened every 10-15 years, and the greater 2016 amount occurred every 25-30 years. A representative from the commission cautioned that the draft was not official, and said that the investigation is ongoing. Baker experienced a couple of notable periods of drought at the very beginning and end of his tenure. Kriseman’s team said the mayor’s point about Baker going through ""significant periods of drought"" is bolstered by Baker referring to a 2002 drought in his 2011 book The Seamless City. ""During my terms, the issues that generated the single largest number of complaints came in 2002 during a drought."" Baker wrote. Kriseman’s team also provided PolitiFact with a 2007 Water Resources Department memo that talked about water restrictions in the city because of the lack of rainfall. Brian Fuchs, an associate geoscientist and climatologist at the National Drought Mitigation Center, compiled a time series of drought data for Pinellas County from 2000 to Aug. 2, 2017. Yellow bars indicate abnormally dry conditions. (The county level is the smallest geographic point the Drought Monitor can address.)  Baker encountered the tail end of the worst period of drought in Pinellas County when he took office in April 2001. The eight-month 2000-01 stretch was the worst drought of the last 17 years (when the Drought Monitor began collecting data). But drought conditions lifted that summer, and there was no drought for the next five years. And after a three-week period of minimal drought for just 1 percent of the county in the summer of 2006, the county remained drought free until January 2007. The county experienced periods of moderate drought in 2007 and 2008, but none that matched the intensity of 2000-01. The year 2009 saw periods of moderate and severe drought but could not be considered extreme, according to the Monitor. Flash forward to Kriseman’s first term. Kriseman’s first two years were relatively normal. Then in late 2016, after the bad storms, moderate drought covered the entire county. ""Overall, both mayors had both wet and drought periods during their tenures in office,"" Brouillette said. Kriseman addressed the disparity between sewage spilled under his administration and Baker’s by saying, ""We also had wet weather events that (Baker) did not experience. He went through significant periods of drought during his time as mayor."" Kriseman's explanation is exaggerated. Experts told us the weather was only slightly more favorable to Baker than Kriseman. Both mayors experienced significant rain events and some drought. While heavy rains played a role in the sewage spills, both the handling of the Albert Whitted plant as well as decades of city neglect put St. Petersburg's massive sewage problems into motion. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. So we rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/aug/10/rick-kriseman/was-weather-during-krisemans-term-perfect-storm-se/

Testing Democratic challenger claim on Scott Walker taking money from internet expansion
","In statewide elections, Democrats tend to rely on an urban base. But in a July 14, 2017, interview on WisconsinEye, gubernatorial hopeful Andy Gronik criticized Gov. Scott Walker for a lack of progress in plans for rural development in the state. ""To suggest to our rural areas in Wisconsin that Governor Walker has a real plan and that he really cares about economic development in those areas -- come on,"" Gronik said, later adding: ""The fact that Governor Walker has taken money away from internet expansion around our state is ludicrous."" The notion that Walker has taken money from internet expansion comes from a controversial move in 2011, when state officials returned nearly $23 million in federal stimulus money from the National Telecommunications & Information Administration. The grant would have ""boosted broadband connections in 380 Wisconsin communities, including 385 libraries and 82 schools,"" the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in 2011. The Gronik campaign cited the piece as its initial backing for the statement. But is Gronik’s claim accurate today? We took a look at the circumstances of 2011 -- and at what's happened since. The 2011 picture The $23 million grant was returned a year after it was awarded. The money was provided through the federal Broadband Technology Opportunities Program, which aimed to expand broadband access to underserved rural areas across the country. Walker’s decision was a source of disappointment for school and library associations, and viewed with skepticism by Democrats such as Mark Pocan, then a state lawmaker, who argued the decision was in the interest of Walker’s ""big telecommunications campaign donors."" AT&T employees and the company’s political action committee donated more than $20,000 to Walker’s 2010 campaign. AT&T contracts with the state to manage and maintain the infrastructure that forms the BadgerNet Converged Network, the public network that was to receive the federal funds. Ironically, that public/private partnership made it difficult for the state to meet the grant requirements. And giving back the money was something many agreed with at the time. ""After months of negotiations that spanned administrations, it was clear the unique nature of Wisconsin’s Badger Network was not compatible with the technical requirements of the NTIA,"" said David Cagigal, chief information officer of the state’s Department of Enterprise Technology in a statement to Politifact Wisconsin. ""In fact, the Badger Network we have in the state was able to accomplish the same goals of the NTIA funding by 2014."" Barry Orton, a retired University of Wisconsin-Madison telecommunications policy professor, said the public/private partnership made meeting federal requirements difficult. ""Other states and the feds said, ‘Well, this money shouldn’t go right to the carriers, it should go to local governments, to non-profits, to co-ops. We want to see that the money is spent for actual new broadband rather than increasing the capital budgets of existing carriers,’ "" he said. Others noted taking the grant without meeting the requirements would have left Wisconsin taxpayers with a $23 million bill. Tony Varda, who has spent 11 years as the chair of the board for the Town of Berry, still supports the decision, despite his town’s need for better broadband connections. ""You gotta think about it a little before you look the gift horse in the mouth,"" he said. ""But when we looked in the mouth here, it wasn’t pretty."" So, Walker clearly turned back money for internet expansion -- but the picture is much more blurry, as the state’s existing set-up created complications in accepting it. The picture since Since 2011, the state’s efforts to expand internet access -- especially rural areas -- have grown. In an analysis of NTIA and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) data, the Public Service Commission (PSC) of Wisconsin and the state-level Wisconsin Broadband Office found coverage expansion in ""practically every county,"" including 20,000 households with improved connections. Over the last five years, the PSC gave out $5.5 million in grant funding to underserved areas of the state. In Walker’s current two-year budget request, he asked lawmakers to approve $15 million in grant money. He also requested more than $25 million for the TEACH program, which provides infrastructure and teacher training grants for schools. Though the budget is stalled before the Legislature, the outlook for including the internet money is promising, said Elise Nelson, spokeswoman for the PSC. Those who work with public schools and libraries said things are on the upswing. ""Schools are in a much better position now,"" said Dan Rossmiller, director of government relations at the Wisconsin Association of School Boards. ""They have much better bandwidth at much lower cost than they did then."" Nevertheless, the internet challenges in rural Wisconsin are far from solved. Walker’s $15 million request over two years is less than the $20 million allocated this year alone in Minnesota’s development grant program, Border to Border. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission monitors the percentage of people who lack broadband connectivity each year in 56 states and territories. The 2016 average for the 50 states and Washington, D.C., was 13% -- the same as the portion of Wisconsinites who lack coverage. In rural areas, the national number jumps to 38%. Wisconsin comes in at 43%, roughly equal with Minnesota. Our rating Gronik says Scott Walker ""has taken money away from internet expansion in our state."" In 2011, Walker’s first year in office, the state returned $23 million to the federal government -- though the decision is not as simple as Gronik portrays it. Since then, Walker’s office has increased funding for broadband development grants. Price tags aside, the data available on rural coverage put the state’s reach on par with Minnesota -- which spent tens of millions more in the same time frame -- and in the middle of the pack of neighbors Illinois, Iowa and Michigan.

Does it cost $75K per year to lock up an inmate in California?
","U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris believes taxpayers aren’t ""getting a good return on investment"" when it comes to California’s prison system. The California Democrat told the Women Unshackled forum in Washington D.C. in July that alternatives to locking up inmates, such as drug treatment programs, are far cheaper and sometimes more effective than prison sentences. Her figures for California’s per inmate costs were eye-opening. ""Let’s look at the fact that there is an issue around how much we are paying — and again, this gets back to the economic cost — it costs us about $33,000 a year to lock somebody up. In California it costs about $75,000 a year,"" Harris said on July 18, 2017.  Harris makes her claim at about the 16:50 minute mark in the video above. Harris made criminal justice reform a top priority during her time as California’s attorney general and has done the same so far in the Senate. Recently, she teamed up with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., to push bipartisan bail reform legislation that would prevent minor offenders from sitting in jail if they can’t afford the cost of being released before trial. In discussing prison costs, Harris said governments should place a greater focus on crime prevention and drug treatment given the high cost of incarceration. We interpreted Harris's claim about per inmate expenses to mean the operational costs to house male and female inmates, including security, health care, facility upkeep and employee compensation. Advocates for criminal justice reform often argue that just looking at the operational costs of running prisons ignores the social costs of incarcerating Americans. We looked at those costs as well, but based our rating primarily on the evidence supporting the numbers Harris cited in her Women Unshackled appearance. Our research A spokesperson for Harris provided us with data on the cost of federal incarceration, from the independent Vera Institute of Justice, as well as numbers for California, based on Gov. Jerry Brown’s spending plan for the 2017-18 fiscal year. In its May 2017 report ""The Price of Prisons,"" the Vera Institute examined the cost to house inmates at prisons nationwide. It obtained data for 45 states and found the total cost per inmate averaged $33,274. The institute advocates for reducing inmate totals and improving conditions in prisons. It reported receiving about three-quarters of its funding from the federal government. The study’s findings support Harris’ claim on the average cost of housing inmates nationally. But what about the California’s per inmate price of $75,000? For that figure, Harris’ spokesman cited a June 2017 article by the Associated Press. It estimated the cost per inmate would reach a record $75,560 in the current fiscal year. The AP based its estimate on the money Gov. Brown set aside in this year’s budget for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. To verify this figure and put it in context, we examined the governor’s 2017-18 budget and contacted the Brown Administration’s corrections and finance departments, as well as the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. These sources pointed us to the projected $76,320 cost per inmate in Brown’s 2017-18 budget. That qualifies as ""about $75,000"" as Harris put it. A spokeswoman for the state’s corrections department told us California paid about $73,000 per inmate last fiscal year, also very close to Harris’ number. Cost in context While Harris’ numbers are nearly spot on, we wanted to know what’s driving this high cost to lock up prisoners in California. The expense to house each inmate has doubled since 2005, even as court orders reduced the prison population by about a quarter, according to the Associated Press. Several reasons account for the dramatic increase. Viewed simply, fewer inmates combined with higher corrections spending equals a higher per capita cost. But why are there fewer inmates and higher spending? California was forced to cut inmate levels after a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision found that overcrowding in prisons violated constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. The drop in inmates hasn’t led to the closure of any prisons and hasn’t led to a reduction of prison staffing that corresponds directly to the drop in inmates. Jonathan Peterson, an analyst at the Legislative Analyst’s Office, said that’s because there are security requirements at the prisons that don’t allow for the elimination of guards simply because there are fewer inmates. ""Regardless of how many inmates are in a particular unit, you still need the one guard to open and close the doors,"" Peterson said. The governor’s budget expects a nearly 2-to-1 inmate to prison staff ratio for the current fiscal year. That’s down from a ratio of a 2.24-to-1 just two years ago. Higher employee costs Just as the inmate population started to drop, employee compensation in the prison system jumped significantly. The corrections department budget has gone up $1.2 billion since 2012 due to employee compensation and retirement costs, according to the Department of Finance. Of that increase, $436 million is directly tied to increased pension contributions by the state for prison employees. Additionally, in July 2013, the state opened the California Health Care Facility providing 2,600 beds for inmates needing medical attention. The facility has cost $288 million since it opened, the finance department reported. California voters have contributed to the shrinking prison population in recent years by approving ballot measures that reclassify many felony drug and property crimes as misdemeanors and improving chances for parole for offenders classified as nonviolent. These measures are expected to further reduce the prison population by thousands of inmates. If that happens and prison employee costs rise or stay stable, California’s per capita inmate expense will continue to be higher than other states. Our ruling Sen. Kamala Harris recently claimed ""it costs us about $33,000 a year (nationally) to lock somebody up. In California it costs about $75,000 a year."" A recent study that examined costs in 45 states plus data from California’s departments of corrections and finance support the senator’s statement. Digging deeper, we found reducing inmates in California’s prisons, which Harris supports, may actually increase the per capita costs she highlights. That will be especially true if salary and pension costs continue to increase as inmate numbers drop. Harris doesn’t make a specific claim about what’s driving these costs. Her statement centers on the costs alone to house inmates nationally and in California. The evidence supports the figures she cited. We rate Harris' claim True.

Trump blames Obama for decline in federal drug prosecutions and increase in opioid deaths
","President Donald Trump took a swipe at former President Barack Obama as he renewed his pledge to tackle the opioid epidemic, which claims the lives of tens of thousands of people a year. Trump said that opioid overdose deaths have nearly quadrupled since 1999, speaking after a briefing on the issue. But while deaths soared, Trump said overall drug prosecutions declined in recent years -- a trend Trump vowed to reverse. ""We're going to be bringing them up and bringing them up rapidly,"" he said Aug. 8. ""At the end of 2016, there were 23 percent fewer than in 2011. So they looked at this scourge, and they let it go by, and we're not letting it go by."" We found that Trump is correct that federal drug prosecutions declined from 2011 to 2016 under Obama, but he lacks evidence to prove that’s the culprit for the opioid overdose crisis. A White House spokesman declined to comment on the record. The Justice Department filed drug charges against 24,638 defendants in 2016, down 23 percent from 2011, according to the Pew Research Center, which analyzed federal data. The data reflects felonies and some serious misdemeanors. But that’s overall drug prosecutions, not just prosecutions related to opioids. And it only includes federal prosecutions -- the vast majority of criminal prosecutions are in state courts. We found that the drop was due to some of the specific actions the Obama administration took to stop the prosecution of low-level offenders. Pew noted that in 2013, then-Attorney General Eric Holder directed federal prosecutors to ensure that each case they brought served ""a substantial federal interest."" Holder mandated that certain low-level nonviolent drug offenders, with no ties to gangs or cartels, would no longer face mandatory minimum sentences. He called for more treatment and alternatives to prison. Also in 2013, U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memorandum to federal attorneys related to prioritizing marijuana prosecutions. He directed attorneys to focus on cartels or other criminal organizations and the use of violence to distribute the drug. Federal marijuana prosecutions fell to 5,158 in 2016, down 39 percent from five years earlier, Pew found. Trump implied that lack of prosecutions likely led to a worsening of the opioid crisis. But experts we contacted had a different view. ""No serious analyst would argue that federal prosecutions have consequences for opioid overdoses,"" said University of Maryland criminology professor Peter Reuter. ""The drivers of that increase are the arrival of fentanyl, since about 2012, and the overprescription of opioids before it. There has been some decline in heroin retail prices. But no prior effort against high-level distributors and traffickers has ever had sustained success at the retail level."" Some drug experts including Dr. Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University's Heller School for Social Policy and Management, have criticized Obama for taking too long to address the crisis, but not because of a lack of prosecutions. ""Obama deserves blame for neglecting the epidemic and failing to ensure a coordinated federal response,"" Kolodny said. ""I can think of several areas where it's fair to criticize him. The decline in federal drug prosecutions is not one of them."" Trump has a point that the Obama administration was slow to respond to the opioid crisis, said Jon Caulkins, a Carnegie Mellon professor and expert on drug policy. ""Anyone looking at the basic death stats knew we had a problem by 2000,"" Caulkins said. ""So this is a national disgrace, and Obama was in power for eight of the more recent years, and if ‘the buck stops on the president’s desk’ then it’s fair to put some blame there."" A September 2016 report from the Obama administration’s Justice Department found that prosecutors could help combat the epidemic by prioritizing prosecution of heroin distributors and of medical professionals who improperly prescribe opioids. The report also stated that federal prosecution had ""lagged,"" and more prosecutors were needed. The report noted, however, that investigations ""can be difficult when the victim is deceased and the source of the drugs is not immediately obvious."" Trump said ""at the end of 2016, there were 23 percent fewer federal prosecutions than in 2011, so (prosecutors) looked at this surge and they let it go by."" Trump made the statement in the context of rising opioid overdose deaths. An analysis of data shows that federal drug charges overall declined 23 percent between 2011 and 2016. But that data doesn’t tell us anything about opioid cases specifically. Where Trump misses the mark is his suggestion that the drop in prosecutions is to blame for the opioid epidemic, which started before Obama’s tenure and then grew worse during his presidency. Obama could have done more earlier to address the epidemic, experts said, but there is no evidence that his strategy on federal drug prosecutions led to a spike in opioid overdose deaths.

Cooper says Dems won nearly half of 2016 vote, but hold only 35% of NCGA seats

""Last year, Democrats won nearly 50% of the vote, yet they hold only 38% of the seats in the State House and 30% of the seats in the State Senate,"" the newsletter claims. The claim implies that some voters’ ballots count far more than others. But is it true? The second part of the claim is accurate.. In the state House, 46 of 120 members are Democrats. In the state Senate, 15 of the 50 members are Democrats. Those percentages check out. The first part of the quote doesn’t specify which Democrats Cooper is talking about, and the full newsletter doesn’t elaborate. A reader might assume it’s referring to the votes cast for the state House and Senate. But campaign spokesman Morgan Jackson says the Democrats who received nearly 50 percent of the vote were those in ""all major 2016 races"" – not just General Assembly elections. The campaign pointed out the low number of Democrats in the state House and state Senate ""to illustrate that North Carolina is a true swing state and Republicans in the General Assembly have unconstitutionally gerrymandered the legislature,"" Jackson said. Jackson said the campaign looked at the races for president, U.S. Senate, U.S. Congress, state House, state Senate, governor and other Council of State races. Council of State races include the lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, state treasurer, state auditor, superintendent of public instruction, labor commissioner, insurance commissioner and agriculture commissioner. In the races identified by Cooper’s campaign, Democrats won 47.4 percent of the vote, according to the elections board. They garnered about 32.1 million out of 67.8 million total votes, while Republicans got about 35 million votes. Libertarians and unaffiliated candidates got the remaining 671,000 votes. Defining 'nearly' How close were Democrats to drawing 50 percent of the vote, or 33.9 million votes? About 1.7 million votes. Does that constitute ""nearly"" 50 percent? In the world of statistics, the word ""nearly"" isn’t well-defined, said Len Stefanski, head of the N.C. State University Department of Statistics. ""What a statistician can do is say, when voters are behaving more or less like coin tosses, is 47 percent different from 50 percent when you have 60 million coins tossed? The answer would be yes,"" Stefanski said. In other words, 1.7 million votes is too many to gloss over. The margin of error for stats that large is 0.012 percent, Stefanski said. On the other hand, people aren’t coins. They can be influenced by current events or even the media, he said. A sign of gerrymandering? Then there’s the issue of whether Democrats’ performance in statewide races, compared with the number of seats they hold in the legislature, is evidence of gerrymandering. Opinions vary. Michael Li, senior redistricting counsel for the NYU School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice, thinks the comparison is fair. ""It’s on the right track,"" Li said. ""The analysis might be a little more sophisticated than that or complicated than that."" He said votes for, say, governor, don’t necessarily need to match representation of state legislative seats in order for election maps to be considered fair. ""But you wouldn’t expect the disparities that you have,"" Li said, referring to North Carolina. Eric McGhee, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, says people are better off determining redistricting bias by making apples-to-apples comparisons. ""I don't think a discrepancy between partisan votes for higher office and seats held by a party in the legislature necessarily means anything,"" McGhee wrote in an email. ""But a discrepancy between votes for the *legislature* and seats held in the legislature certainly can."" There are 120 state House districts and 50 state Senate districts. More than 8.3 million votes were cast in those races. Democrats received a bit more than 3.7 million – 45 percent – and were 418,000 votes away from reaching 50 percent of the vote. When it comes to elections, 45 percent of the vote likely wouldn’t come close to qualifying for a recount. Whether it’s ""nearly"" 50 percent is subjective, said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. ""But I probably wouldn’t use it if I was describing a 53/47 two-way split in the electorate,"" Murray said in an email. McGhee, the expert in California, said voters should also consider uncontested races when weighing the fairness of election maps. Fifteen of the state Senate’s 50 districts went uncontested, while 56 of the state House’s 120 districts were uncontested. That means 41 percent of legislators ran unopposed in the November elections. Our ruling Cooper’s claims about Democratic representation in the state House and state Senate are accurate. His claim that Democrats won close to 50 percent of votes is slightly exaggerated if only legislative races are considered, but is closer to the mark when it comes to broad support for Democratic candidates. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/aug/09/roy-cooper/cooper-says-dems-won-nearly-half-2016-vote-hold-on/

Viral image wrongly blames Bill Clinton for giving North Korea the means to make nuclear weapons
","A viral meme spreading through Twitter blames former President Bill Clinton for not just allowing North Korea to develop nuclear weapons, but fostering their program more than two decades ago. ""Bill Clinton gave North Korea $5 billion and two nuclear reactors in 1994, essentially giving them nukes,"" read the meme we first noticed on Aug. 9, 2017. It included an image that showed Clinton seated next to late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. It’s worth noting that the photograph is actually from Aug. 4, 2009, when Clinton traveled to Pyongyang to negotiate the release of two American journalists. Kim Jong Il died two years later. HELP KEEP POLITIFACT GOING!
MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO SUPPORT
INDEPENDENT FACT-CHECKING The meme popped up after revelations that Kim Jong Un’s regime had potentially developed miniaturized nuclear devices capable of fitting inside intercontinental ballistic missiles. The center of this claim — that Clinton negotiated a deal with North Korea that included two reactors — is based on a real agreement. But there are significant problems with the assertion that Clinton paid the country $5 billion, ""essentially giving them nukes."" While president, Clinton did broker a deal with North Korea, amid revelations that the country was building a full-scale processing facility to produce plutonium. North Korea had kicked international inspectors out of the country in 1993, announcing its intention to pull out of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, an international agreement North Korea had joined in 1985. By then, the North Koreans had separated enough plutonium from spent fuel from a reactor it had built while Clinton was governor of Arkansas to create a couple of nuclear weapons, according to Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. In October 1994, Clinton arranged a deal with incoming leader Kim Jong Il, whose father Kim Il Sung had died in July. North Korea would have to take its current reactor offline and stop construction of two other reactors they said were for electricity. In exchange, the United States would help the country build two so-called light-water nuclear reactors to produce power for the country. The light-water reactors would make it harder for North Korea to produce weapons-grade material. Those reactors were estimated to cost about $4 billion, and would be financed by South Korea, Japan, and possibly Germany, Russia and the United States, the Washington Post reported. In addition, the United States would help provide heavy fuel oil to North Korea, which would have to halt plans to produce nuclear weapons and submit to international inspections. It would have to surrender spent nuclear fuel once the new reactors were built. The deal, which did not require congressional approval, was referred to as the Agreed Framework. Clinton hailed it as a path to easing sanctions and normalizing diplomatic relations. ""This agreement will help achieve a longstanding and vital American objective — an end to the threat of nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula,"" Clinton said of the deal. Spoiler: The Agreed Framework failed. North Korea accelerated its efforts to enrich uranium, which wasn’t a direct violation of the framework, and accused the United States of reneging on fuel oil promises. That certainly irked the George W. Bush administration, which cut off fuel oil shipments in 2002. North Korea withdrew from the agreement, ending its obligation to abide by the deal’s terms. By 2006, North Korea claimed it had successfully tested a nuclear device. To say that Clinton’s deal was the culprit is wrong, however. Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said that while the Agreed Framework was flawed, it impeded North Korea’s ambitions. The meme misrepresented much about the deal. ""This is a problem that is years in the making, owned by bipartisan administrations, and — for a time, anyway — delayed by President Clinton rather than him giving North Korea nuclear weapons,"" Nephew said. Importantly, Clinton didn’t give North Korea two reactors, because the construction was never completed. You can even look up the unfinished sites online. And the $5 billion figure the viral image cited wasn’t cash, but likely included the construction costs of the reactors (which were never completed) and energy aid. The Congressional Research Service noted in a 2014 report that the United States provided more than $400 million in heavy fuel oil to North Korea between 1995 and 2003. The consortium created to oversee the reactors’ construction, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, still exists on paper. It officially ended the light-water reactor project, but is still working ""to settle financial and legal obligations stemming from the termination."" ""All the North Koreans got out of it in the end is that they stole the construction equipment"" for the reactors, Pollack said. ""They also learned a few things about building that type of reactor. They’ve tried to make a small initial one themselves, but it appears to have been stalled for years now."" In the meantime, Pollack added, the North Koreans have created enough plutonium and enriched enough uranium to create as many as 60 nuclear bombs.  An image circulating on the Internet claims ""Bill Clinton gave North Korea $5 billion and two nuclear reactors in 1994, essentially giving them nukes."" Clinton did negotiate a deal in 1994 to provide two nuclear reactors and provide heavy fuel oil to North Korea in exchange for the country giving up its nuclear weapons program. That's about where the truth of this image stops. The energy aid costs didn’t approach anywhere near $5 billion, and the reactors were never built. North Korea had continued to enrich uranium on its own, leading the Bush administration to end the deal. The agreement, while a failure, didn’t give North Korea nuclear weapons. Experts said the agreement actually slowed North Korea down. We rate this statement False.",/factchecks/2017/aug/09/viral-image/viral-image-wrongly-blames-bill-clinton-giving-nor/

Fact-checking Donald Trump's misleading tweet about U.S. nuclear arsenal
","One day after threatening North Korea with ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" if it menaces the United States, President Donald Trump tweeted about the strength of U.S. nuclear weapons and improvements made on his watch. Trump wrote at 4:56 a.m: ""My first order as president was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before."" My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before.... This tweet is not accurate. A week after taking office, Trump issued a presidential memorandum on ""rebuilding the U.S. Armed Forces."" One sentence in this memo directs the defense secretary to ""initiate a new Nuclear Posture Review to ensure that the United States nuclear deterrent is modern, robust, flexible, resilient, ready, and appropriately tailored to deter 21st-century threats and reassure our allies."" The review effort kicked off in April 2017, according to news reports. However, this wasn’t Trump’s first order as president — more than a dozen earlier executive orders and memoranda are listed on the White House website. More importantly, asking for a Nuclear Posture Review is not unusual; it’s expected. The Defense Department’s web page for the Nuclear Posture Review describes it as ""legislatively mandated."" HELP KEEP POLITIFACT GOING!
MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO SUPPORT
INDEPENDENT FACT-CHECKING Indeed, it’s common for new presidents to put their stamp on the nation’s nuclear capabilities by issuing a new review within two years after entering office. Bill Clinton produced one in 1994. George W. Bush produced one in 2002. And Barack Obama produced one in 2010. (Apparently, the Trump administration hasn’t updated its Pentagon web page on the Nuclear Posture Review. When we accessed it on Aug. 9, it still had a photo and ""notable quote"" by Hillary Clinton on it.) A larger issue with Trump’s assurance: Experts unanimously said the U.S. nuclear arsenal could not have improved to the extent Trump described in just over 200 days. There have been incremental improvements, but they have been trickling out under a plan begun under Trump’s predecessor, Obama. The United States is engaged in a multiyear program to modernize the nation’s nuclear arsenal, including the rebuilding of the Minuteman III system, which launches intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the Trident II submarine-launched missile systems, as well as the refurbishment of nuclear warheads and construction of new and upgraded facilities, such as a uranium processing facility in Oak Ridge, Tenn. (Here’s an updated rundown of the modernization plan published by the Arms Control Association.) The modernization effort was estimated to cost roughly $35 billion a year over a decade, or 5 percent to 6 percent of planned national defense spending, according to Congressional Budget Office reports released in December 2013 and January 2015. Its most recent estimate, released in February 2017, CBO said the modernization effort would cost $400 billion between 2017 and 2026, or $52 billion more than CBO’s 2015 estimate, ""largely because modernization programs will be ramping up."" Cumulatively, total costs could reach $1 trillion over the next 30 years.   Experts panned Trump's boast of rapid improvements. ""It would be a pretty fantastic claim under even Cold War standards given the size and scope of the arsenal,"" said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy and a former State Department official under Obama. But given the restrictions under the New START treaty that went into force in 2011, it would be ""pretty difficult, if not impossible, to achieve except in a crash, well-publicized effort."" Matthew Bunn, a nuclear-policy specialist who teaches at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, called Trump’s claim ""simply false."" ""There is a total of nothing that has changed substantially about the U.S. nuclear arsenal over the few months that Trump has been in office,"" Bunn said. ""We have the same missiles and bombers, with the same nuclear weapons, that we had before."" Bottom line: In the scale of decades, six months is a blink of the eye, experts said. This is not the first time Trump has sought to paint a picture of weak stewardship of the U.S. nuclear arsenal under Obama. As early as June 2015, Trump said, ""Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work. It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked."" We rated that False.   Trump said, ""My first order as president was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before."" What Trump did shortly after taking office was neither his first order nor a unique action; every new president in recent years has requested a Nuclear Posture Review. In addition, the ongoing nuclear modernization plan -- which dates back to the Obama administration and will take decades to complete -- would not have notched achievements in six months sufficient to be characterized as ""far stronger and more powerful than ever before.""

In campaign video, PA gov candidate Scott Wagner takes a ‘guess’ on property taxes
","Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Scott Wagner tried to school voters last week with an ""educational video"" featuring him standing in front of a government organizational chart blasting tax increases under consideration in Harrisburg. Problem is, the Republican state senator from York apparently based part of his lesson on little more than a hunch. In the campaign video titled ""Drain the Harrisburg Swamp"" posted on YouTube Aug. 2, Wagner criticized a $2.2 billion revenue package approved by the state Senate at the end of July that includes some targeted tax increases meant to balance the $32 billion spending plan that lapsed into law a few weeks prior. Wagner, who's running for governor in 2018 and voted against the bill that’s still waiting on House approval, said in the video that even modest tax increases will impact Pennsylvanians, particularly those already seeing property tax hikes heading into the 2017-18 school year. ""On July 1, a lot of people started receiving their school tax bills,"" Wagner said in the video. ""Those tax bills didn’t go down. And they didn’t say the same. They went up. And I can assure you that 80 percent of the school tax bills in the state of Pennsylvania went up over last year."" Wagner didn’t cite a source or state department to support his ""80 percent"" claim, so we decided to check the facts. PolitiFact Pennsylvania couldn’t find a single report to indicate that eight in 10 Pennsylvanians saw a school property tax increase this year -- and Wagner’s campaign didn’t attempt to prove that it’s true. When reached by PolitiFact late last week, campaign spokesman Jason High said Wagner was in fact referring to school property taxes when he said ""school tax bills,"" and indicated the state senator didn’t actually know how many Pennsylvanians saw their property taxes rise this year when he threw out the 80 percent number in last week’s campaign video. ""The 80 [percent] number was simply a guess that Scott made based on his own personal experiences and the feedback that he’s heard from people around the state,"" High said. So was his ""guess"" close? According to one study, sort of. Though school districts across the state set property tax rates prior to the end of the fiscal year on June 30, the state Department of Education hasn’t released comprehensive data on the number of Pennsylvanians facing property tax increases in the 2017-18 school year compared to the 2016-17 school year. Department spokesperson Casey Smith said the most recent figures available are from 2015-16. The closest data we could track down that looked at property tax rates across Pennsylvania’s 500 public school districts for the 2017-18 school year came from a June budget report commissioned by the Pennsylvania Association of School Business Officials and the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators. The report, based on responses from 332 school districts, was conducted in the spring, and therefore unable to report how many school districts actually hiked property taxes this year. But it did indicate how many planned to. Surveyors found that 70 percent of school districts that responded anticipated increasing property taxes in 2017-18, not far off from Wagner’s 80 percent claim. Just 12 percent of school districts reported they anticipated increasing property taxes above the Act 1 index, a cap of sorts that’s meant to allow districts the ability to increase property taxes consistent with inflationary cost increases. If a district wants to raise property taxes above that index, it must either send the tax hike to a referendum or request a waiver from the Department of Education. The Pennsylvania Association of School Business Officials and the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators don’t know if 70 percent of respondent school districts actually did raise property taxes this year -- just that they anticipated needing to. A study of how many districts followed through on that will come this fall. Jay D. Himes, the executive director of PASBO, said the number of school districts raising property taxes across the state sat at about 70 percent for several years as mandated costs continue to ""far exceed"" new revenue from the state. Himes, who has worked on this report for seven years, said usually the number of school districts that actually increase property taxes is slightly lower than the number that indicate they anticipate a hike in the spring. ""In terms of property taxes, what usually happens is the most conventional way of school budgeting is plan for the worst and hope for the best,"" he said. ""That would usually mean that some districts that said they were going to raise may not, and some districts won’t raise as high because rather than more guesswork involved, it’s more real-time data."" Mark DiRocco, executive director of the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators, said ""the majority"" of school districts in Pennsylvania have steadily raised property taxes since the Great Recession, while ""a lot of districts still have not recovered from"" massive cuts to public education approved in 2011 under former Gov. Tom Corbett. He added that many school districts are still seeing revenue losses even beyond what property tax increases can cover. That’s largely driven by increasing costs related to pension contributions, special education, healthcare and charter school payments, he said. Our ruling In what he described as an ""educational video"" posted to his campaign website, state Sen. Scott Wagner, running for governor in 2018, said ""80 percent of the school tax bills in the state of Pennsylvania went up over last year."" Of the state’s 500 school districts, 332 responded to a survey and, of those, 70 percent indicated they anticipated raising property taxes in the 2017-18 school year. But there’s been no comprehensive data officially released by the state showing the number of districts that actually approved property tax hikes this year. Wagner’s team indicated the gubernatorial candidate was acting on a ""guess"" when he threw out the 80 percent number in his campaign video. Lucky for him, that guess will likely end up being close.

Are renovations keeping Trump out of the White House?
","President Donald Trump partly blamed White House renovations for his Bedminster golf course retreat in a tweet on Aug. 7, 2017. ""Working hard from New Jersey while White House goes through long planned renovation. Going to New York next week for more meetings."" Working hard from New Jersey while White House goes through long planned renovation. Going to New York next week for more meetings. We’ve already rated Trump’s promise to not take vacations as Stalled, but we wondered about the scope and timeline of the renovations keeping him away from the Oval Office. It turns out they were indeed long in the planning. The West Wing’s 27-year-old heating, ventilation and air conditioning system is being re-upped because thanks to constant use, deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said, the system is well past its life cycle. ""The West Wing will be without air conditioning for the next two weeks, which is why the staff and the president are moving out, because I don’t think any of you would like to be in the West Wing in an August D.C. summer day when it’s over 100 degrees with no air conditioning,"" Walters said. The General Service Administration assessed and priced at $1.97 million the installation of a new system in the West Wing in 2014, but only presented a plan to change it in the fall of 2016. The Obama administration approved the project but left its realization to the next president. The Trump administration will take advantage of the time for the air conditioning repair to also switch out the carpeting and paint the walls. Those cosmetic changes, Perry said, are commonplace for an incoming first family. These renovations typically occur closer to Inauguration Day, but the Trump administration deferred them until August. Carpet replacement will cost $1.17 million and a fresh coat of paint $275,000. Betty Monkman, who served as White House curator from 1967 to 2002, told us that August is a great time for refurbishments as the president and his family are away, staffers take vacation, and Congress isn’t in session. The staffers who are still working in the West Wing were relocated to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, an unusual move for annual refurbishments. ""I don’t remember the staff being moved to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, but this affects the whole building,"" Monkman said. ""The West Wing is small for all the staff that uses those spaces and it’s constantly being updated, so things change to accommodate that."" The last time the HVAC unit was changed in the residence (which is separate from the West Wing) was in 1994, Monkman recalled. The renovation was still in the works when President Bill Clinton and his family returned from Martha’s Vineyard, so they stayed across the street at the Blair House, the president’s guest house. The Trumans also stayed at the Blair House when they gutted and rebuilt the White House. In addition to these changes, the White House is also renovating the Navy Mess kitchen, the West Wing lower lobby, the IT system and the South Portico steps. And following a week of flash floods in Washington (as well as frequent discussion of leaks to the press), they’re addressing ceiling leaks in the Lower Press area. Trump said the White House was going ""through long planned renovation."" The HVAC system upheaval keeping him and his staff out of the West Wing has been in the planning since 2014, while other typical White House refurbishments like carpet replacement and repainting have been put off since the inauguration. Presidents typically take an August recess and relocate to Blair House if more time is necessary, so we see nothing out of the ordinary in Trump’s tweet.

Posts wrongly blame John McCain for deadly 1967 fire aboard USS Forrestal
","Several websites have dredged up erroneous details of a deadly naval accident to smear U.S. Sen. John McCain’s service record after his vote against a GOP health care bill. Calling McCain ""a traitor and disgrace to the American People,"" an Aug. 6, 2017, post on WorldNewsCircle.com attacks the Arizona Republican for his role in a 1967 fire on the USS Forrestal during the Vietnam War. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. They also highlighted similar posts on some other sites.   Appearing after McCain derailed GOP efforts on July 28 to pass a bill in the Senate repealing the Affordable Care Act, the article blames the then-U.S. Navy pilot for the blaze. ""McCain train wreck career met an all time low when he was singlehandedly responsible for starting a fire on USS Forrestal Aircraft Carrier,"" the post read. ""The accident claimed the lives of 134 sailors and left permanently disabled another 161 who were dismissed from active duty."" The essay said McCain ""decided to practice a reckless maneuver that day called a wet start,"" in which a pilot sends extra fuel to a jet’s thrusters to create a showy flame on takeoff. The post said that wet start ignited an adjacent plane’s missiles, which fired and hit ""multiple planes filled with explosives all through the carrier’s deck."" (Still more internet posts have been saying McCain dropped his plane’s own bombs on the deck, causing the explosions, or that McCain abandoned the deck prematurely.) This charge has been leveled against McCain before, as the event did come up during his 2008 presidential campaign. But official reports and other accounts don’t support the assertion that he was responsible. McCain was aboard the Forrestal as a lieutenant commander piloting an A-4 Skyhawk for the U.S. Navy on July 29, 1967, the day of the fire. The Forrestal had recently been resupplied with munitions, including 1,000-pound bombs from the Korean War, stored on the deck, because modern bombs were in short supply. McCain’s jet was parked on the deck, tail pointed outward before takeoff, as the ship sailed in the Gulf of Tonkin. McCain didn’t ""wet start"" his jet, but rather an F-4 Phantom about 100 feet away at the opposite end of the deck accidentally fired a rocket because of an electrical surge. The details vary depending on the account, but the rocket hit either McCain’s plane or the plane of fellow Skyhawk pilot Lt. Cdr. Fred White. Our friends at FactCheck.org found that McCain’s own statements immediately after the disaster showed him admitting his memory of the event was muddled. McCain remembered the rocket hitting his own plane in Chapter 14 of his 1999 book Faith of My Fathers: ""In the next instant, a Zuni missile struck the belly fuel tank of my plane, tearing it open, igniting two hundred gallons of fuel that spilled onto the deck, and knocking two of my bombs to the deck."" But the official U.S. Navy report of the accident said the rocket hit White’s plane, rupturing the fuel tank and igniting the jet fuel. A fragment also punctured the fuel tank of another Skyhawk next to White, spilling more fuel and igniting it. The rocket itself fell into the ocean without detonating, but a bomb from one of the aircraft exploded as crew members rushed to put out the flames. (Subsequent reports have noted modern bombs would not have ""cooked off"" the way the Korean War-era munitions did, contributing to the disaster.) Gregory Freeman, author of the 2002 book Sailors to the End, has sided with McCain’s account, but conceded on his website that it was entirely possible the rocket hit both Skyhawks. Narrated video of the event showing the explosion is available on YouTube: McCain managed to escape his cockpit through the flames, suffering burns and shrapnel wounds in his legs and chest. He described the conflagration in his book: ""All around me was mayhem. Planes were burning. More bombs cooked off. Body parts, pieces of the ship, and scraps of planes were dropping onto the deck. Pilots strapped in their seats ejected into the firestorm. Men trapped by flames jumped overboard. More Zuni missiles streaked across the deck. Explosions tore craters in the flight deck, and burning fuel fell through the opening into the hangar bay, spreading the fire below."" McCain wrote that he helped dump some bombs over the side of the ship before heading to the ready room and then sick bay to treat his wounds. He acknowledged the crew managed to control the flight deck fire by that afternoon, but below-deck fires lasted for another 24 hours. ""The fires were consuming the Forrestal. I thought she might sink,"" he wrote. ""But the crew’s heroics kept her afloat. Men sacrificed their lives for one another and for their ship. Many of them were only 18 or 19 years old."" The Forrestal was drydocked and refit, staying in service until being decommissioned in 1993. The fire, considered the worst combat-related naval disaster since World War II, led to changes in crew training and flight deck procedures. McCain transferred to the USS Oriskany, the aircraft carrier from which he took off on Oct. 27, 1967, the day he was shot down over North Vietnam and taken prisoner. Bloggers said McCain ""was singlehandedly responsible for starting a fire on (the) USS Forrestal aircraft carrier."" Though specific details vary, no official or thoroughly researched account of the Forrestal fire blames McCain or any other particular pilot. A rocket from a jet other than McCain’s misfired due to an electrical surge, hitting a plane from across the flight deck and starting the blaze. Several other factors contributed to the conflagration burning out of control and killing 134 sailors and pilots.

Chicago soda tax throws a batting practice fastball to Illinois Policy Institute
","On Aug. 2, Cook County became the largest government in the United States to charge a tax on sweetened drinks. The debut of the penny-an-ounce charge for drinks sweetened with sugar or non-caloric sweeteners wasn’t exactly smooth, nor was it particularly well received with the soft drink-consuming public. Customers who examined their receipts at some stores found they had been charged extra for flavored seltzer water -- which is not subject to the new tax -- while restaurant patrons discovered those ""free"" refills now cost one cent per ounce. Cook County sweetened beverage tax applies to free refills of lemonade. pic.twitter.com/PDztyTDIBl As soft drink consumers and sellers came to grips with the new charges, the libertarian Illinois Policy Institute – never a fan of any tax, and a particularly harsh critic of the tax habits of Cook County and Chicago – framed the drink tax in a consumer unfriendly light. ""The new tax will make soda sold in Chicago among the most expensive in the country,"" the institute said in a tweet and in the headline of an article on its website. That is a little like proclaiming the sun rises in the east, but given intense public interest in the soda tax we thought it was a worth a look anyway. Accompanying the institute’s tweets were graphics illustrating the various taxes that now will be paid by those purchasing sweetened drinks in Chicago. The new soda tax makes soda sold in #Chicago among the most expensive in the country https://t.co/2JYANKDrcs pic.twitter.com/KiUS5vzIYT The new soda tax makes soda sold in #Chicago among the most expensive in the country https://t.co/2JYANKDrcs pic.twitter.com/KiUS5vzIYT Chicago already charged a 3 percent soft drink sales tax, and that was on top of a 10.25 percent sales tax that includes state and local portions and is the highest of any major city in the United States. For a 12-pack of 12-ounce cans or bottles of any sweetened soft drink, regular or diet, the sweetened beverage tax adds another $1.44. Thus, a 12-pack priced at $4 costs $5.97 at the register. The new tax adds 67 cents to a two-liter bottle. If marked on the shelf at $2.49, the new tax means you’ll pay 40 percent more at checkout. That’s how it works in Chicago, where the total price figures to be slightly higher than in the rest of Cook County even though the soda tax applies in the suburbs as well. Does that make Chicago-bought soda ""among the most expensive in the country?"" The institute grants its statement a lot of leeway by using the word ""among."" Wherever the thirsty buy it, a Big Gulp is a Big Gulp is a Big Gulp. So the add-on cost of taxes is likely the prime factor behind any significant price differences. To date, the list of places embracing a soda tax is an extremely short one, hence Chicago’s (and Cook County’s) emergence as among the most expensive places to pop for a pop. As it stands today, Cook County is one of only eight U.S. locations to impose or plan to impose a per-ounce tax on sweetened drinks. The other seven are cities and, with a population of 5.2 million, Cook County is by far the largest jurisdiction to adopt such a tax. Issue-wise, this is right in the Illinois Policy Institute’s wheelhouse. It not only piles expense onto an extremely popular category of consumer products, but it also comes swathed in nanny state good intentions for the health of Cook County residents. By strange coincidence, this health concern arrives just as Cook County finds itself in desperate financial straits. (In another article, the institute claims Cook County can’t even get its nanny state act right, as federal rules prohibit applying the new tax to sweetened drinks purchased with food stamps. It notes that ""polling shows people with lower incomes are more likely to drink soda."") At one cent per ounce, Cook County is on the lower end of the soda tax scale. In Boulder, Colo., that two-liter soda will cost an extra $1.35 and a 12-pack will be $2.88 more. Cook County is also one of the three jurisdictions in which voters did not voluntarily adopt the tax by referendum. (Illinois has no provision for such referenda.) There have been many complaints that Cook County’s soda tax was sold to voters as an anti-obesity measure but also includes drinks containing non-caloric sweeteners. But the ordinance itself contains extensive language citing studies that link even diet drink consumption to kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and obesity. Cook County and the city of Philadelphia are the only places where drinks sweetened with non-caloric sweeteners also are subject to the tax. Thus, even among the eight places in the nation taxing or preparing to tax consumers by the ounce for sweetened soft drinks, Cook County’s measure reaches an especially broad swath of consumers. The Illinois Policy Institute cites Cook County’s new sweetened drink tax as making soda sold in the city of Chicago ""among the most expensive in the country."" With Chicago already charging the nation’s highest sales tax of any major city plus a 3-percent soft drink tax, it’s almost certain that consumers in the city paid ""among"" the highest prices for soft drinks in the country even before the Aug. 2 arrival of the sweetened drink tax. But Chicago truly moved into a select group when its home county joined the seven other cities that have enacted or are poised to enact by-the-ounce taxes on sweetened soft drinks. With a nod to Captain Obvious, we raise a glass of flattened, left-out-in-the-open Coke in the direction of the Illinois Policy Institute as we rate this statement True.  ",/factchecks/2017/aug/07/illinois-policy-institute/chicago-soda-tax-throws-batting-practice-fastball-/

Trump claims new U.N. sanctions cost North Korea over $1 billion
","President Donald Trump applauded a new resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions against North Korea and labeled it as the largest economic punishment yet on the nation. ""The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact!"" Trump tweeted Aug. 5. The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact! He detailed the impact in a follow-up tweet: ""United Nations Resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever on North Korea. Over one billion dollars in cost to N.K."" United Nations Resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever on North Korea. Over one billion dollars in cost to N.K. Trump has sought China’s help to deal with security threats from North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and has called on other nations to join the United States in implementing sanctions against North Korea. On Aug. 5, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution to prohibit certain exports from North Korea, among other economic restrictions. We wondered if Trump accurately assessed the resolution and its impact. We found that Trump was largely right about the resolution’s provisions, but experts cautioned that the true financial impact of the sanctions depend on future enforcement by member nations. We reached out to the White House but did not hear back. On Aug. 5, the 15 nations that make up the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2371 (2017) to place new sanctions on North Korea. The resolution comes after North Korea’s most recent ballistic missile launches, in violation of a ban on nuclear and missile tests. The new U.N. resolution says: • North Korea shall not supply, sell or transfer coal, iron, iron ore, seafood, lead and lead ore to other countries; • UN Member States shall not increase the number of work permits for North Korean nationals (unless approved by the Security Council Committee), based on concerns that their earnings support North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs; • States shall prohibit the opening of new joint ventures or cooperative entities with North Korean entities and individuals, or the expansion of existing joint ventures through additional investments. The resolution also identified nine individuals and four entities that would become subject to a travel ban and asset freeze. The asset freeze extends to the Foreign Trade Bank, a state-owned bank that serves as North Korea’s primary foreign exchange bank. Provisions in the resolution could reduce North Korea’s revenue by about $1 billion, according to statements from delegates in the Security Council. The ban on exports from North Korea will prevent it from earning ""over a $1 billion per year of hard currency that would be redirected to its illicit programs,"" said a resolution fact sheet from the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. The east Asian nation earns about $3 billion per year from export revenues, the fact sheet said. Trump’s tweet on the gravity of the sanctions echoes what Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said after the resolution passed. ""This resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled against the North Korean regime,"" Haley said Aug. 5. ""The price the North Korean leadership will pay for its continued nuclear and missile development will be the loss of one-third of its exports and hard currency. This is the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation."" The United Nations has passed multiple other resolutions against North Korea in condemnation of its ballistic missiles tests. A November 2016 resolution restricted exports of coal from North Korea and banned copper, nickel, silver, and zinc exports. That resolution estimated cuts of at least $800 million per year to North Korea’s revenues. Whether the Aug. 5 sanctions have the weight Trump and Haley professed depends on enforcement by other nations, experts told us. The latest sanctions ""could be the biggest economic sanctions resolution imposed on North Korea, measured in the amount of hard currency provided to the regime — IF enforced,"" said Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia and director of the China Power Project for Center for Strategic and International Studies. The claim that the United Nations sanctions would cost North Korea more than $1 billion is based on the assumption of ""full and perfect"" enforcement by all member states, said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, associate scholar at Foreign Policy Research Institute and co-editor of North Korean Economy Watch. ""Judging by previous sanctions rounds (and sheer logic) this is virtually impossible and extremely unlikely because China tends to be lax in enforcement even of resolutions against North Korea that it votes in favor of,"" Katzeff Silberstein said. In a post for North Korean Economy Watch, Katzeff Silberstein noted that if a previous resolution had already been implemented in full, ""North Korea’s export revenues would already have been badly hit."" Trump tweeted, ""United Nations Resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever on North Korea. Over one billion dollars in cost to N.K."" The United Nations Security Council on Aug. 5 passed a resolution to sanction North Korea in response to its ballistic missile tests. The resolution bans the country’s export of coal, iron, iron ore, seafood, lead and lead ore to other countries; freezes assets of certain entities and individuals; and prevents other nations from increasing the number of work permits to be issued to North Korean nationals. Overall, the sanctions could represent about $1 billion in costs to North Korea — but experts say that greatly depends on other nations’ full enforcement of the sanctions. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/aug/06/donald-trump/trump-claims-un-sanctions-cost-north-korea-over-1-/
