Pants on Fire: Jerry Jones says 'absurd' to firmly link football, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy
","The owner of America’s Team says science hasn’t cemented a link between playing football and chronic traumatic brain injury. Jerry Jones got into the tender topic on March 22, 2016, during the NFL’s annual meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, Dallas Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple told us by email. We’d reached out to Dalrymple after seeing a March 23, 2016, news story in The Washington Post quoting Jones saying he’s not convinced medical and scientific research have established a link between football and brain disease. According to the Post, Jones was asked to clarify whether there is, in his view, enough data to establish such a link. ""No, that’s absurd,"" Jones told reporters. ""There’s no data that in any way creates a knowledge. There’s no way that you could have made a comment that there is an association and some type of assertion. In most things, you have to back it up by studies. And in this particular case, we all know how medicine is. Medicine is evolving."" Dalrymple emailed us a partial transcript indicating Jones was responding to a question about if data shows an established link between football and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, a specific progressive degenerative disease of the brain: REPORTER: ""No data, in your mind, to have a relationship between CTE and playing football?"" JONES: ""No, that's absurd. There's no data that in any way creates knowledge. There's no way that you can have made a comment that there's an association or some type of assertion."" Contrasting NFL comments We asked Dalrymple how Jones reached that  conclusion. Dalrymple said Jones hadn’t said then and Dalrymple didn’t think there would be follow-up. What Jones said in Florida lined up with a February 2016 response by Dr. Mitch Berger, who leads the NFL’s subcommittee on former players and long-term effects of brain and spine injury. At the time, Berger was asked by Bruce Arthur, a Toronto Star columnist, if he believes the link between football and CTE had been established. He said, ""No."" But the next month, at a March 14, 2016, roundtable discussion held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rep. Jan. Schakowsky, D-Ill., asked Jeff Miller, the NFL’s senior vice president for health and safety, if the link between football and neurodegenerative diseases such as CTE has been established ""The answer to that question is certainly yes,"" Miller replied. An ESPN recap characterized that response as ""the first time a senior league official had conceded football's connection to the devastating brain disease."" Boston University leads research So, has science established a link between football and CTE? It seems so. For instance, it’s been three years since the publication of ""League of Denial,"" the book by ESPN reporters Mark Fainaru-Wada and Steve Fainaru that walked through research signaling that players who take a pounding on the gridiron--much like boxers, as established decades before--risk brain damage. According to the book, the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at the Boston University School of Medicine, home to neuropathologist Ann McKee, had quickly grown to be recognized as the nation’s leading authority of football-related brain effects--including CTE. The center, which says it collaborates with other institutions, partners and academic researchers to ""expand our understanding of CTE,"" says on its website: ""CTE has been known to affect boxers since the 1920s. However, recent reports have been published of neuropathologically confirmed CTE in retired professional football players and other athletes who have a history of repetitive brain trauma. ""This trauma triggers progressive degeneration of the brain tissue, including the build-up of an abnormal protein called tau,"" the center says. ""These changes in the brain can begin months, years, or even decades after the last brain trauma or end of active athletic involvement. The brain degeneration is associated with memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, impulse control problems, aggression, depression, and, eventually, progressive dementia."" McKee said at a press conference before the Super Bowl in 2009 (seven-plus years ago): ""I have never seen this disease in the general population, only in these athletes. It’s a crisis, and anyone who doesn’t recognize the severity of the problem is in tremendous denial."" More recently, a March 16, 2016, ESPN news story by the ""League of Denial"" authors said McKee has diagnosed 176 CTE cases in five years, including 90 of 94 former NFL players whose brains were examined; 45 out of 55 college players; and six out of 26 high school players. ""It's overwhelming that this is occurring in professional players; we're just seeing it over and over,"" McKee said. National research perspective We tried to run Jones’ statement past McKee, hearing back from the center’s Chris Nowinski, a former pro wrestler and author of ""Head Games: Football’s Concussion Crisis."" By email, Nowinski pointed us to a web post by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, last updated in March 2015, stating the institute’s first ""consensus workshop"" of CTE scientists the month before had concluded that ""thus far, this pathology has only been found in individuals exposed to brain trauma, typically multiple episodes. How common this pathology occurs at autopsy and the nature and degree of trauma necessary to cause this neurodegeneration remain to be determined."" Nowinski also noted the March 16, 2016, ESPN news story both noting the scientific consensus and stating that brain bank studies had lately detected CTE ""in a large percentage of former high school football players and other athletes"" and scans newly showed ""signs of the disease in NFL players decades after their retirement. All that said, ESPN reported, Dr. Walter Koroshetz, director of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, cautioned that much remains unknown about CTE such as how common it is, when and why symptoms develop, and how the disease -- associated with depression, dementia and memory loss -- spreads inside the brain. The story summed up: ""Although many questions remain unanswered, the research appears not only to reinforce the connection between repetitive head trauma and CTE, but also suggests that the disease may be prevalent among people in the general population who played contact sports, not just former NFL players."" Finally, the story noted an independent analysis of brain tissue from people who had played contact sports and those who had not. Researchers including Kevin Bieniek, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Mayo Clinic's Department of Neuroscience, reviewed 66 brains of people who had played contact sports -- primarily high school and college football, but also boxing, rugby, wrestling and soccer. They also examined the brains of 198 control subjects who hadn’t been exposed to contact sports. And in the end, they spotted CTE signs in the brains of 21 people who played contact sports -- at a rate of almost one in three -- but no such signs in the brains of the people who had not played contact sports. Other scientists We asked a Johns Hopkins medical expert, Kostas Lyketsos, to analyze Jones’ claim. Through Kristin Mears, spokeswoman for the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Lyketsos emailed this statement: ""In my view, there is good evidence to support ‘a link’ between playing football and long-term consequences of traumatic brain injuries such as developing CTE. The science, however, is still very limited in terms of the strength of the link and many other important aspects of this link. The research that would be necessary to clarify these issues is costly and will take a long time to complete."" We also connected with Dr. Vassilis Koliatsos, a Johns Hopkins professor of pathology, who said by phone there’s a risk of CTE from any contact sport, including boxing, rugby and ice hockey. ""The problem is not whether there is a risk,"" Koliatsos said, ""but how much of a risk there is. The answer is we really don’t know."" He said it would help to have a study following people over time bolstered by PET scans to look for tau buildups in the brains of  living people. ""What we have now is backward data, brains from people who did poorly. We don’t know about people who have done fairly well. That is the scientific issue,"" Koliatsos said. Our ruling Jones said it’s ""absurd"" to say there’s enough data to establish a link between playing football and CTE. In fact, scientists have reached consensus establishing this link, though research remains to be done on the degree to which football players and others involved in high-contact activities risk CTE.

Hitting war on drugs, Bernie Sanders says U.S. puts marijuana in same class as heroin
","Campaigning for president in the liberal oasis of Madison, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont rose to the defense of marijuana. Critical of the nation’s war on drugs, Sanders said the lives of millions of Americans have been ""ruined"" because they got a police record for possessing marijuana. ""Today, under the federal Controlled Substance Act, marijuana is listed in the same Schedule I as heroin. That is nuts,"" Sanders declared March 26, 2016, 10 days before he defeated Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin’s Democratic primary. ""Now people can argue -- although I suspect in this audience there may not be much of an argument -- about the pluses and minuses of marijuana,"" he said, drawing cheers from some of the thousands in attendance at the Alliant Energy Center. ""But everybody knows marijuana is not a killer drug like heroin."" Sanders then noted he had introduced legislation to remove marijuana from the Controlled Substance Act because possession of it ""should not be a federal crime."" We found that Sanders wasn’t smoking anything funny in claiming that both marijuana and heroin are Schedule I drugs, which he has continued to say while campaigning in New York and Pennsylvania. But his claim is somewhat misleading: That classification is based on a drug’s acceptable medical use and the drug’s abuse or dependency potential, not on criminal statutes. The law The Controlled Substance Act, adopted in 1970, uses five schedules to classify drugs and narcotics by medical use and potential to incite substance abuse. On the low end is Schedule V, which includes substances such as cough medicines with small amounts of the narcotic codeine. At the high end is Schedule I, which lists the ""most dangerous"" drugs -- those that have ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse."" Marijuana is stronger than when the Controlled Substance Act was adopted (as ex-GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina correctly stated). Nevertheless Schedule II includes some drugs often considered more dangerous than marijuana. Here’s a look at some of the drugs in the two schedules: Schedule I Schedule II Marijuana Cocaine Heroin Methamphetamine LSD Methadone Ecstasy OxyContin Peyote Fentanyl The Huffington Post in April 2016, citing figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the nation recorded no marijuana overdose deaths in 2015. Likewise, there were zero in 2014. It’s possible marijuana might soon be moved off of Schedule I. A week after Sanders’ speech, the Washington Post reported that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said it hopes to decide by July 2016 whether to change the federal status of marijuana. Now let’s get to Sanders’ implication that the schedule relates to criminal law enforcement. Marijuana treated differently Distribution, manufacturing or possession of a Schedule I substance is indeed a federal offense. Additionally, marijuana being on Schedule I, drug policy experts told us, makes it more difficult for licensed dealers in states that have legalized marijuana or medical marijuana to get bank accounts and to deduct business expenses on their taxes. And the classification makes it more difficult for researchers to study marijuana in clinical trials. But judges come down harder on heroin possession than marijuana possession. And when it comes to enforcement of criminal statutes, the federal government to some extent has looked the other way when it comes to marijuana. As PolitiFact National stated in a related fact check:   Schedule I substances cannot legally be used for medical purposes, however, 20 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws legalizing medical marijuana.  In 2009, the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, told federal law enforcement agencies to stop targeting medical marijuana dispensaries, signaling a change from the approach of Obama’s predecessor, Republican President George W. Bush. Similarly, in 2013, the Department of Justice said it would not target new laws in Colorado and Washington legalizing recreational marijuana. While Sanders equates the handling or marijuana and heroin, it’s difficult to imagine the federal government not enforcing the law if states started legalizing heroin. Our rating Criticizing the nation’s war on drugs, Sanders says that under the federal Controlled Substance Act, ""marijuana is listed in the same Schedule I as heroin,"" even though ""marijuana is not a killer drug like heroin."" Like heroin, marijuana is indeed listed as a Schedule I drug, the federal designation given to drugs considered the most dangerous. But at least under the Obama administration, the federal government doesn’t treat it as one under the law. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/046c4622-acb2-422a-b6cd-ffa78af57f99",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAA5800>],/factchecks/2016/apr/22/bernie-sanders/hitting-war-drugs-bernie-sanders-says-us-puts-mari/

N.C. Gov. Pat McCrory, under fire on HB2, says Human Rights Campaign is 'more powerful than the NRA'
","When one thinks of the country’s most powerful lobbying groups, acronyms like NRA, AIPAC and AARP spring to mind. So do phrases like Big Pharma, Big Oil and Wall Street. During an appearance April 17 on NBC’s ""Meet The Press,"" North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory made the argument that the Human Rights Campaign is also among the most powerful lobbies in the United States. ""The Human Rights Council, my gosh, they’re more powerful than the NRA,"" McCrory said, meaning the Human Rights Campaign and the National Rifle Association. The Human Rights Campaign, or HRC, is a major player in the opposition to North Carolina’s controversial new law, House Bill 2, which limits LGBT rights in public accommodations — and which McCrory was on national television to defend. ""They are putting on a lot of pressure instead of having good dialogue,"" McCrory said. The HRC is the country’s largest gay rights group. It has led the charge for gay marriage and for the types of LGBT discrimination protections that HB2 prohibited cities in North Carolina from making. But has the group really eclipsed the NRA, an oft-cited stereotype of a powerful lobbying group that can shape public policy and opinion? McCrory says it has. And in the last few days, that claim has been picked up as a talking point by supporters of HB2. Measuring political power It would be big news if McCrory was right. Debates over gay rights, as with gun rights, are a large part of modern political discourse. We don’t know what criteria McCrory was using, if any, to make his claim. ""Meet The Press"" host Chuck Todd didn’t ask him to elaborate. When we asked McCrory’s campaign about his rationale, spokesman Ricky Diaz called it a ""ridiculous question"" and declined to answer. We also asked both the HRC and the NRA whether they agreed with McCrory. The NRA did not respond, and the HRC declined to answer. There are many ways to measure a group’s strength. We asked an expert, UNC-Chapel Hill political science professor Frank Baumgartner, who has written multiple books on special interest groups and lobbying. He listed three main ways to measure influence: Money and resources, ""cultural resonance"" and record of success or failure. Baumgartner said he believes McCrory’s comparison is ""false or substantially exaggerated."" But let’s look into the numbers to see if they back that up. Money Money is especially important in modern politics because of the Citizens United ruling that McCrory mentioned, which allows for unlimited political spending. In 2014, according to federal tax filings, the NRA and its foundation had revenue of $356.1 million, compared with $51.2 million for the HRC and its foundation. Money allows interest groups to hire lobbyists, contribute directly to politicians and political groups or take part in what’s known as outside spending – TV ads, mailers and other political initiatives. In the 2014 election cycle, according to the Center For Responsive Politics, the NRA’s political spending was 7.5 times greater than the HRC’s ($36.8 million to $4.8 million). In the 2012 cycle, the NRA spent five times as much ($26.9 million to $5.1 million). In both cycles, the NRA spent more on lobbying than the HRC spent on lobbying, contributions and outside spending combined. For outside spending in particular, the NRA spent about $350 for every $1 the HRC spent. ""Cultural resonance"" How do you measure this? It sounds intangible, but there are ways to break it into specific, quantifiable pieces. And in everything we looked at, the NRA came out on top. Membership, magazine subscriptions, Google searches, social media following and official government mentions all show the NRA’s presence is anywhere from 2 to 10 times larger than the HRC’s. Both groups have magazines. The HRC’s goes to more than 350,000 homes, according to a group spokesman this week. According to the publishing group Alliance for Audited Media, the NRA’s three magazines had a combined circulation in 2015 of more than 3.5 million. As for membership, both have been accused in the past of inflating their numbers. Take it with a grain of salt, but the NRA claims 4.5 million members compared with 1.5 million for the HRC. The NRA also has a larger audience on social media – 4.8 million Facebook likes and 345,000 Twitter followers, compared with 2.3 million Facebook likes and 529,000 Twitter followers for the HRC. We also compared online searches, which indicate how interested people are in learning about the groups. When their Google searches over the last 12 years are graphed against each other, the HRC’s results show up as an almost flat line hovering just above 0. We used Google Trends to aggregate numerous terms related to both groups and map their relative popularity as compared with all other searches each month. The NRA is in red and the HRC is in blue. Even the HRC’s best month didn’t surpass the NRA’s worst month.  We also counted how often they’re mentioned in congressional hearing transcripts and other documents listed by the U.S. Government Publishing Office search engine –1,408 results for ""National Rifle Association"" and 393 for ""Human Rights Campaign."" Reputation and success Baumgartner said he thinks this was the point McCrory was trying to make – on a group’s ""ability to push public policy in a direction the group prefers."" And again, Baumgartner said, the HRC doesn’t quite stack up. ""I'd say Human Rights Campaign has had some success,"" he said. ""But no, they would not compare to the long-run success of groups such as the NRA, the Realtors, the petroleum industry, the Chamber of Commerce and many others."" The NRA is famous for its clout and success in Congress. The HRC, on the other hand, has achieved most of its biggest victories – gay marriage, gay adoption rights and the invalidation of anti-sodomy laws – at the Supreme Court. The HRC has existed since 1980. For most of that time, one of its top priorities has been a federal LGBT anti-discrimination law. Efforts to pass such laws state-by-state have been mostly unsuccessful, as we explored in a previous fact check. On the national level, friendly legislators have introduced the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, ENDA, in nearly every Congress since 1994. It has failed each time, despite polling that shows about three quarters of Americans support such laws. The NRA has done the opposite, persuading Congress to repeatedly kill legislation that has even broader public support than ENDA does. Even though about 90 percent of Americans support background checks on gun buyers – previous PolitiFact rulings have found a range of 85 to 93 percent – the federal Fix Gun Checks Act has been voted down several times since 2011. It would allow for universal background checks, and the NRA is strongly opposed to it. As for the HRC, it hasn’t been totally unsuccessful in Congress. The group successfully pushed for a 2009 law that expanded federal hate crime definitions to include LGBT status. And what about outside of government, in the corporate world? It’s undeniable that the HRC’s influence there is growing. The group started ranking how ""LGBT friendly"" companies were in 2002 in what it calls its Corporate Equality Index. About a dozen received a perfect score that year. In 2016, more than 400 companies did. And many businesses have followed the HRC in criticizing North Carolina over HB2. But that hasn’t meant much so far. Key legislators have said they have no plans to repeal HB2 or make major changes to it, despite the pressure. On the other hand, the NRA has seen many of its initiatives passed in North Carolina, like 2013 law that loosened restrictions on concealed carry. Our ruling McCrory said the main group against HB2, the Human Rights Campaign, is ""more powerful than the NRA."" It’s a strong claim, given the NRA’s reputation for power and influence, and even the HRC spokesman was unwilling to embrace it. That’s not to say the HRC isn’t powerful. It’s a multimillion-dollar organization and the country’s largest gay rights group. But it doesn’t have the resources, adherents or success rate that the NRA does. In every way we tried to define influence, the HRC doesn’t even come close to the NRA’s level of power. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a1af1e68-c8d1-4ecb-a7d5-36cb928ae38a",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC2F480>],/factchecks/2016/apr/21/pat-mccrory/nc-gov-pat-mccrory-under-fire-hb2-says-human-right/
"['National', 'Debt', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'History', 'Ben Carson']","
Was Andrew Jackson the only U.S. president to bring national debt to zero?
","Former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said it doesn’t make sense that President Andrew Jackson will no longer be the centerpiece of the $20 bill because he was the last master of the federal budget. Carson, who now backs Donald Trump, lamented the 19th century president’s displacement in an April 20 interview on Fox Business. ""Well I think Andrew Jackson was a tremendous secretary — I mean a tremendous president,"" Carson said. ""I mean, Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt."" Black abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who rescued slave families using the underground railroad, will replace Jackson on the front of the $20 bill, while a smaller image of Jackson’s face will appear on the back. Jackson’s appearance on the bill has stirred up controversy as of late, especially because Jackson, a populist and a war hero, presided over the removal of approximately 46,000 Native Americans from their land. We wondered if Carson had his historical facts straight. We took Carson’s statement to mean that Jackson was the last president to do both things: balance the budget and eliminate debt. A lot of presidents have presided over balanced budgets, which is when the government takes in more revenue than it spends, leading to no net borrowing in that year. But a balanced budget doesn’t necessarily mean no debt, because old debt can carry over from previous years. Jackson was, in fact, the only president to preside over a total elimination of all remaining debt while having a balanced budget. However, this wasn’t nearly as dramatic of an accomplishment as it would be today. Experts told us to take this factoid with a grain of salt because the debt was already on its way down, and by the time Jackson took office, the amount of debt was trivial. The history Jackson, who served from 1829-37, was an ardent supporter of keeping banks and government separated. He believed that banks would have undue influence on government, and he was hell-bent on eliminating the debt. (Jackson was also deeply skeptical of paper currency, which adds some irony to the current debate over his position on the $20 bill.) In January 1829, the debt was about $58 million. (Jackson took office that March.) In today’s dollars, that amounts to about $1.4 billion. The total public debt outstanding today is higher by many orders of magnitude: $19.2 trillion. Jackson watched that debt scale down to zero in 1835. According to the Treasury Department, the debt remained close to zero when Jackson left office. But Jackson didn’t have to take much action to make this happen. Since the end of the War of 1812, which racked up a lot of debt, Congress required debt reductions of at least $10 million per year under under Jackson’s two predecessors, James Monroe and John Quincy Adams. So all Jackson really had to do was maintain the status quo, said Daniel Feller, a Jackson expert at the University of Tennessee. ""The policy of paying off the debt happened before Jackson, and he happened to be president"" when the debt hit zero, Feller said. In addition to continuing the already-established debt-reduction policy, Jackson vetoed some infrastructure bills that would have spent money on things like building roads. He also liquidated the Second Bank of the United States, a precursor to the Federal Reserve, resulting in a massive surplus of government money that was used to pay off the last of the debt, said Neil Buchanan, an expert in federal spending patterns at George Washington University Law School. Immediately following Jackson’s departure, the country experienced a financial crisis, the Panic of 1837. The panic resulted from several factors, including the collapse of a speculative land bubble and international capital flows, but some economists believe Jackson’s fiscal policies should carry some of the blame. ""The country did eventually have the good sense to borrow again, to finance the country's enormous economic expansion throughout the 19th and 20th centuries,"" Buchanan said, noting that it is not always desirable to bring debt down to zero. While the only president to see a national debt of zero, Jackson certainly wasn’t the only president who presided over a balanced budget. In today’s world, it’s rare for the federal government to balance its budget, meaning revenue is higher than expenditures. Since the 1960s, only five years have had balanced federal budgets: 1969 under President Richard Nixon; 1998, 1999 and 2000 under Bill Clinton; and 2001 under George W. Bush. But in earlier years, balanced budgets were much more regular. From 1900 to 1960, about 25 years had balanced budgets, according to government historical tables. Before that, we don’t have  year-to-year budget breakdowns. But we do know that there was an overall budget surplus from 1800 through 1850, so balanced budgets were a fairly regular occurrence around the time Jackson was in office. Fuller backed up that point. ""Carson is merely applauding Jackson for having paid off the debt through a one-time gimmick,"" as opposed to adjusting policy to keep the debt low for the long run, Buchanan said. Our ruling Carson said, ""Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt."" Experts say this feat doesn’t really deserve the plaudits Carson is giving it, but Carson has his facts basically right. Jackson was the last — and only — president to bring the national debt to zero on top of having a balanced budget. The statement is accurate but needs added context, which is our definition of Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB5CF40>],/factchecks/2016/apr/21/ben-carson/andrew-jackson-debt-balanced-budget-president/

Hillary Clinton says history shows she can win over Bernie Sanders supporters
","As the list of states that haven’t voted yet dwindles, Democrats are pondering how Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will be able to unify their supporters in advance of November’s general election. Party strategists have worried that aggressive sparring during the New York primary is fraying relations between Clinton, Sanders, and their respective supporters. Polling evidence suggests that there may be reason for such a worry: An April McClatchy-Marist poll found that 25 percent of Sanders supporters said they would not back Clinton as the Democratic nominee, compared to 69 percent who said they would support her. Another 6 percent were unsure. Clinton addressed this during an April 21, 2016, town hall with ABC’s Good Morning America, comparing it to her 2008 primary bid against Barack Obama. ""When I withdrew in June of 2008, polls were showing that at least 40 percent of my supporters said, oh, they weren't going to support Sen. Obama,"" Clinton said at the televised town hall. In other words, Clinton argued, if Obama can come back from even sharper divisions to win the presidency, then she can, too. We looked into the polling archive to see if she has a good argument. We found two polls taken in June 2008 that asked primary supporters of Clinton who they would support with Obama as the Democratic nominee. Here’s the summary:   Pollster Month Will support Obama Will support McCain Won’t vote/ Other McCain support plus won’t vote/other CNN/Opinion Research June 60 17 22 39 ABC News/ Washington Post June 62 25 13 38 So Clinton has a point: In both polls, roughly 60 percent of former Clinton supporters backed Obama, while 40 percent didn’t, either through a vote for Republican nominee John McCain or a vow to do something other than voting for Obama. This means Clinton can take heart that she is already doing about 10 points better securing the backing of Sanders voters than Obama was doing securing support from Clinton backers. We have one small caveat: While the polls from 2008 and 2016 are similar in topic, their wording is slightly different. The 2016 Marist poll uses terminology that’s a bit vague -- the choices are ""support her"" or ""not support her."" By contrast, the 2008 CNN poll was more specific, looking at whether people would vote for Obama, vote for Republican nominee John McCain, or wouldn’t vote at all. Subsequent polling data showed Obama did eventually win the support of Clinton backers. By August 2008, polls showed that Obama was winning 70 percent to 76 percent of Clinton supporters. And of course, Obama went on to win in November. Our ruling Clinton said, ""When I withdrew in June of 2008, polls were showing that at least 40 percent of my supporters said, oh, they weren't going to support Sen. Obama."" The wording of polls makes exact comparisons a bit tricky, but in general, Clinton is right about the scale of Obama’s 2008 problem with dissident Democrats -- and correct that Obama had a harder road then than she seems to have now. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE64540>],/factchecks/2016/apr/21/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-history-shows-win-bernie-sanders/

Did Hillary Clinton's State Department help suppress the minimum wage in Haiti?
","Hillary Clinton colluded with big business to maintain slave wages for workers in one of the world’s poorest countries, according to the host of an RT American comedy news show. Comedian and activist Lee Camp of RT’s Redacted Tonight mocked Clinton’s efforts to ""keep 37 cents per hour out of the hands of destitute Haitians."" ""In 2009, while Bill Clinton was setting up one of the family’s shell companies in New York, in that same year Hillary Clinton was at the State Department working with U.S. corporations to pressure Haiti not to raise the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour from 24 cents,"" Camp said April 17. ""Seriously."" Seriously? Sort of. Memos from 2008 and 2009 obtained by Wikileaks strongly suggest, but don’t prove without a doubt, that the State Department helped block the proposed minimum wage increase. The memos show that U.S. Embassy officials in Haiti clearly opposed the wage hike and met multiple times with factory owners who directly lobbied against it to the Haitian president. The Clinton campaign refuted the claim, and the State Department didn't comment.  HOPE, not change In 2011, Wikileaks made nearly 2,000 cables available to the progressive magazine, The Nation, and Haiti Liberté, a weekly newspaper in Port-au-Prince.   The two media outlets assessed the cables and found, among many other revelations, that the ""U.S. Embassy in Haiti worked closely with factory owners contracted by Levi’s, Hanes, and Fruit of the Loom to aggressively block a paltry minimum wage increase"" for workers in apparel factories. The Wikileaks cables show U.S. Embassy officials began monitoring the minimum wage issue as early as 2008, when the Haitian Parliament began discussing doubling or tripling the daily minimum wage of 70 Haitian gourdes to keep up with inflation. That’s roughly equal to $1.75 a day, or about 22 cents per hour. (Some context here: Three quarters of Haitians live on less than $2 a day, according to the United Nations’ World Food Program, while garments constitute about 90 percent of Haiti’s exports, according to the Guardian. Haiti increased the daily minimum wage to the equivalent of $5.11 in 2014.) But back in 2008 and 2009, embassy officials repeatedly told Washington that a hike would hurt the economy and undermine U.S. trade preference legislation known as HOPE. The program, shorthand for the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006, gives garments manufactured on the island duty free access to U.S. markets. Levi Strauss, Haneswear, Nautica, and Dockers are just some of the American companies that benefit from HOPE. Congress passed HOPE II in 2008, extending the program for another 10 years. In January 2008, Ambassador Janet Sanderson wrote that representatives of the business community — including the man tasked with implementing HOPE — had met with embassy officials and criticized Haitian President René Préval’s efforts to raise the minimum wage as the wrong medicine for the ailing economy. An unsigned embassy cable sent to Washington in December 2008 echoed the private sector’s assessment and reported that increasing the minimum wage would ""have significant impact"" on business. The State Department continued to promote HOPE as an economic boon for the island. In memos prepping U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice and Clinton for their visits to Haiti, chargé d'affaires Thomas Tighe told the diplomats to ""urge""  the Haitian government take advantage of HOPE and HOPE II. After advising a congressional delegation to Haiti almost exactly the same thing, Sanderson told Washington that Haitian Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis was onboard with HOPE, ""although pending legislation to nearly triple the minimum wage would likely set back those efforts in the short term."" Deputy Chief of Mission David Lindwall put it most bluntly, when he said the minimum wage law ""did not take economic reality into account but that appealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses."" Préval as proxy   Nonetheless, the Haitian Parliament voted to triple the daily minimum wage to 200 gourdes ($5 a day, or about 62 cents per hour) in May 2009. As the bill awaited President Préval’s signature, students protested over the delay while factory owners criticized the legislation. The U.S. Embassy, meanwhile, continued to lament the hike and raised concerns about the stability of the region that they hoped Préval would help address, according to the cables. Préval, as they say, leaned in. Sanderson, in a June 10 memo, cited a study by the Haitian Association of Industry (ADIH) stating that the new minimum wage ""would result in the loss of 10,000 workers in the sector"" and noted that ADIH has met with Préval three times. ""A more visible and active engagement by Préval may be critical to resolving the issue of the minimum wage and its protest ‘spin-off' — or risk the political environment spiraling out of control,"" she wrote. A few days later, Préval seemed to be on board with the embassy and industry position on the minimum wage issue. On June 17, Tighe told Washington that industry and USAID studies found that a 200 gourdes minimum wage ""would make the sector economically unviable and consequently force factories to shut down."" He also noted that ADIH members and HOPE factory owners told U.S. officials that in lieu of greenlighting the legislation as is, Préval would instead propose a lower, phased-in minimum wage for the textiles sector (100 gourdes in 2009, 125 gourdes in 2010, and 150 gourdes in 2011). Protesters continued to call for Préval to sign the original bill, with some demonstrations escalating into violence, as parliament considered the president’s amendments. In a June 24 cable to a congressional delegation, Tighe said the demonstrations added uncertainty to the political and security situation in Haiti and  ""job creation under HOPE II may be threatened by a bill Parliament passed May 5 to nearly triple the minimum wage."" When the delegation met with Préval the next day, the president parroted this line and encouraged the congressmen ""to write to Haitian members of Parliament to express concern about the devastating impact a sector-wide increase in wages would have on job security and job creation,"" according to a memo from Tighe. By July, Préval was a formal and vocal opponent of the 200 gourds wage, warning of the consequences for jobs and emphasizing the importance of the assembly sector for exports, according to cables. ""This is the only issue in recent memory where the president has made a strong effort, by negotiating with stakeholders and using the media, to effect a legislative outcome,"" Tighe said. In the fall of 2009, Préval and Parliament agreed to enact the $5 daily wage for all sectors except textiles, which got a $3 wage. But was the State Department right in opposing the increase? ""I have no idea what would happen if Haiti did have a $5-a-day minimum wage,"" Adam Davidson of NPR’s Planet Money said in 2011. ""But I do think it's reasonable to assume that some factories would close and far fewer new ones would be built. Far fewer Haitians would be allowed to take that first tentative step on to the ladder of industrial development."" Our ruling Camp said, ""In 2009 ... Hillary Clinton was at the State Dept working with U.S. corporations to pressure Haiti not to raise the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour from 24 cents."" Leaked cables show that the U.S. Embassy in Haiti opposed the minimum wage hike that the Haitian parliament passed in 2009, and discussed the issue with business groups. However, the cables do not contain conclusive evidence that the State Department actively pressured Haiti to block the increase nor do they prove that Clinton personally played a role. We rate Camp’s claim Half True. Update, April 21, 2016: After we published this fact-check, the State Department told us it had no public, official position in the Haitian minimum wage debate.  ""The U.S. Department of State did not officially oppose or support the three-step proposed minimum wage increases in Haiti – in 2009, 2010, and 2012 – as this was an internal matter,"" a spokesperson said.  The State Department’s public stance does not alter the content of the memos, however. They show that U.S. Embassy officials in Haiti clearly opposed the wage increase.

Claim in Bucks lawmaker’s gun law mailer isn’t exactly what happened
","Pennsylvania laws that govern gun safety regulations were written by state legislators for decades before Steve Santarsiero was elected to a state House seat. But the Bucks County state representative who’s now a candidate for Congress is taking credit for legislation that governs gun safety in Pennsylvania. A mailer sent by his campaign claims Santarsiero, a Democrat running for a seat in the eighth congressional district, ""wrote PA’s Gun Safety Law."" Pennsylvania doesn’t have a law named for gun safety. So we decided to look a little deeper into Santarsiero’s gun-related claims to see which law his campaign was touting. The ad goes on to state: ""After the shooting at Sandy Hook, Steve said ‘enough is enough’ and wrote legislation to close the background check loophole on gun sales and introduced a bill to stop those on the federal terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms in Pennsylvania."" That’s true, but neither of those bills were passed into law. Santarsiero’s campaign manager Eric Goldman said the campaign ""should have more clearly stated he has been fighting for it to become law,"" but added the mailer was not ""intentionally misleading."" He said other mailers and television ads on the issue referred to the legislation as a bill or a proposed law. While Pennsylvania law currently requires background checks for gun purchases from licensed dealers and for the private sale of handguns, Santarsiero’s background check bill would have added a stipulation that private sales of long guns are also subject to a background checks. He first introduced his background checks bill in 2013 and reintroduced it in 2015, but the bill has never been brought to a vote and was last referred to the House Judiciary Committee in October 2015. Similarly, a bill Santarsiero was the prime sponsor of last year would have prohibited the sale of firearms to anyone currently on the federal terrorist watch list, including no-fly lists. That bill was never brought to a vote and was last referred to the House Judiciary Committee in January. In addition to those gun safety-related bills authored by Santarsiero, the state representative implied in his campaign mailer that Pennsylvania has an overarching gun safety law. No such law exists. Gun safety is regulated by the Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act, the last major version of which was written in 1995. Santarsiero was first elected to the state House in 2008. Santarsiero is running in the April 26 primary to replace Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick, a Republican who isn’t seeking re-election. Guns have been at the center of his debates with his primary opponent Shaughnessy Naughton, a magazine publisher. Her campaign manager Erik Polyak called the mailer misleading, saying Santarsiero is ""always exaggerating the record."" A recent television ad released by Santarsiero’s campaign doesn’t include the claim that he wrote a ""gun safety law,"" but rather states that he leads in pushing for expanded background checks in Pennsylvania. Since the school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. that left 20 children and six adults dead, six states have expanded background check regulations. Our ruling Santarsiero, a candidate for Congress, claims in a recent campaign mailer that he ""wrote PA’s Gun Safety Law."" The campaign goes on to reference two bills that were authored by Santarsiero but that never made it out of committee. In addition, Pennsylvania doesn’t have an overarching law that governs ""gun safety"" and the law that does govern gun safety wasn’t written by Santarsiero. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB98FF80>],/factchecks/2016/apr/21/steve-santarsiero/claim-bucks-lawmakers-gun-law-mailer-isnt-exactly-/

Trump says Cruz has been 'mathematically' eliminated from winning the nomination on 1st ballot
","Donald Trump said his landslide win in New York destroyed Ted Cruz’s chances of getting the GOP nomination through the primary process. With 60.5 percent of the votes in the Empire State, the Republican frontrunner is projected to nab 89 delegates, while Cruz picked up none. (Ohio Gov. John Kasich got three.) This means that it is impossible for Cruz to secure the 1,237 delegates needed for the nomination on the first ballot, according to Trump. ""Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race,"" he tweeted April 20. ""Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary!"" Does Trump’s math stack up? The answer is more complicated than you’d expect. It boils down to how you interpret some state rules and whether or not you count unbound delegates. We explained the delegate process in-depth here, but here’s a brief overview. To win the Republican nomination, a candidate has to clinch the support of a majority of 2,472 delegates. Most, but not all, are obligated to vote for the candidate who won their congressional district’s or state’s nominating contest. But if no one gets to the 1,237 threshold on a first vote, many delegates are ""released"" to vote for whomever they want on second and third ballots. So Cruz (or Kasich or really anyone) does have a path forward in this sense. But Trump’s statement is about that first ballot. So far, 41 states and territories with a total of 1,798 delegates have already held primary or state conventions. Fifteen contests with 674 delegates are still up for grabs. We looked at estimates for how many delegates Cruz has won from major outlets like the Associated Press, the New York Times and 538.com (Fox News uses the AP’s counter) and two popular blogs that track delegate math. The figures reported range from 542 ""hard"" delegates (meaning they’re bound to Cruz on the first ballot) to 559 ""soft"" delegates (including those who aren’t bound but have said they’d vote for him). This means that Cruz would need at the very least 678 more to get the nomination, so 100 percent of the remaining delegates plus four more. And if we don’t count the unbound delegates from Pennsylvania (54) and West Virginia (three), he’d need 110 percent of the remaining bound delegates. Seems mathematically impossible, right? But here’s the catch: Cruz could fish for more supporters among the 1,798 delegates from states that have already held primaries. At least 45 of them will arrive at the Republican National Convention not committed to any candidate (three from Colorado, five from the Virgin Islands, 8 from Guam, one from American Samoa and 28 from North Dakota). ""I suppose if every unpledged delegate broke for him, maybe,"" said Seth Masket, a political science professor at the University of Denver. Of course, winning 100 percent of the remaining delegates and retroactively recruiting more is a tall feat. Masket pointed out that it’s pretty unrealistic. And a handful of states that award delegates proportionally — for example, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington — make it near impossible, according to Josh Putnam, a government professor at the University of Georgia and founder of Frontloading HQ. ""The key is that mathematically (Cruz) can't get there through the allocation process. He would have to lean on some large share of the small sliver of first-ballot unbound delegates,"" Putnam said. For the record, not even Cruz himself thinks he'll get to 1,237. ""We are headed to a contested convention. At this point, nobody is getting 1,237,"" Cruz told Philadelphia radio host Chris Stigall on April 20. ""Donald is going to talk all the time about other folks not getting to 1,237. He's not getting there, either."" Our ruling Trump said, ""Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race."" Cruz would need at the very least 678 more delegates to win the race. It’s impossible for him to reach that number in the remaining primaries, given that there are just 674 delegates left to win. However, he could conceivably find more supporters in the states who’ve already held primaries, given that a few dozen are thus far uncommitted. Trump’s statement is largely accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/614c5bc7-e903-4c05-9fc7-352f789fed99",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF18D80>],/factchecks/2016/apr/20/donald-trump/trump-largely-accurate-cruz-has-been-mathematicall/

Donald Trump praises Rex Ryan's imaginary AFC championships
","Sometimes politicians make our jobs too easy. This is one of those times. At a rally in New York ahead of that state’s primary, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump was introduced by Buffalo Bills football coach Rex Ryan. ""There's so many things I admire about Mr. Trump, but one thing I really admire about him is, you know what, he'll say what's on his mind,"" Ryan told the crowd. ""But so many times, you'll see people, a lot of people want to say the same thing. But there's a big difference. They don't have the courage to say it. They all think it, but they don't have the courage to say it."" When it was Trump’s turn to talk, he repaid Ryan with a compliment. ""You know, he won championships in New York,"" Trump said. ""The AFC, I think, twice.""  Ryan has coached seven years in New York, six with the New York Jets (who technically play their games in New Jersey) and one with the Bills. He has a career coaching record of 58 wins and 61 losses. And, he has never won the AFC championship -- the winner of which goes on to the Super Bowl. Ryan’s teams lost in the AFC championship game both in 2009-10 (Indianapolis Colts 30, Jets 17) and in 2010-11 (Pittsburgh Steelers 24, Jets 19). Just to round this out, Ryan hasn’t won a division championship in New York, nor did he ever play on a New York team that won a championship. This claim rates False.

Bernie Sanders says Hillary Clinton had 'one line on the Palestinian people' in key speech on Israel
","On ABC’s This Week, host George Stephanopoulos asked Bernie Sanders about his remark during the New York Democratic debate that the United States should play ""an evenhanded role"" with regard to Israel and its neighbors. Sanders told Stephanopoulos that he thinks President Barack Obama has ""done much better than his predecessors"" in taking the kind of approach he prefers, but added that ""I think we still have a way to go. And I was not criticizing President Obama. I was criticizing (former Secretary of State Hillary) Clinton. She gave a speech to AIPAC"" -- referring to the most prominent pro-Israel group in the United States. ""It's a long speech. It was one sentence, I believe, that even mentioned the Palestinians."" While Sanders went on to say that ""it goes without saying"" that ""we have to protect 100 percent Israel's right to exist, its right to live in peace, its right to live in security,"" he added that ""you cannot ignore the suffering of the Palestinian people."" When Stephanopoulos asked whether he thought Clinton has ignored the suffering of the Palestinian people, Sanders reiterated that her AIPAC speech had ""one line on the Palestinian people."" We wondered whether Sanders’ was right that Clinton ""had one line on the Palestinian people"" in her AIPAC speech. So we looked closely at her address. The most obvious way to look at this is to count the number of references to the Palestinians in Clinton’s speech and see if they amount to more than one line. Sanders is wrong by that simple metric, as we’ll show. But to broaden our look somewhat, we also analyzed more generally how much of Clinton’s speech addressed the Israeli-Palestinian peace process as opposed to how much it addressed Israel’s security needs. What Clinton said about the Palestinians Here is the main section of her AIPAC speech -- which she gave on March 21 --  that addressed Palestinians. The sentences that mentioned the Palestinians by name are in bold. And here is a third choice. Will we keep working toward a negotiated peace or lose forever the goal of two states for two peoples? Despite many setbacks, I remain convinced that peace with security is possible and that it is the only way to guarantee Israel’s long-term survival as a strong Jewish and democratic state.

It may be difficult to imagine progress in this current climate when many Israelis doubt that a willing and capable partner for peace even exists. But inaction cannot be an option. Israelis deserve a secure homeland for the Jewish people. Palestinians should be able to govern themselves in their own state, in peace and dignity. And only a negotiated two-state agreement can survive those outcomes.

If we look at the broader regional context, converging interests between Israel and key Arab states could make it possible to promote progress on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Israelis and Palestinians could contribute toward greater cooperation between Israel and Arabs.

I know how hard all of this is. I remember what it took just to convene Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas for the three sessions of direct face-to-face talks in 2010 that I presided over. But Israelis and Palestinians cannot give up on the hope of peace. That will only make it harder later.

All of us need to look for opportunities to create the conditions for progress, including by taking positive actions that can rebuild trust — like the recent constructive meetings between the Israeli and Palestinian finance ministers aiming to help bolster the Palestinian economy, or the daily on-the-ground security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

But at the same time, all of us must condemn actions that set back the cause of peace. Terrorism should never be encouraged or celebrated, and children should not be taught to hate in schools. That poisons the future.

Everyone has to do their part by avoiding damaging actions, including with respect to settlements. Now, America has an important role to play in supporting peace efforts. And as president, I would continue the pursuit of direct negotiations. And let me be clear — I would vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council. This section includes the word ""Palestinian"" or a variant seven times, over the course of five sentences. So Sanders is wrong that Clinton ""had one line on the Palestinian people."" She had -- using the strictest definition possible -- five lines. Mentions of the peace process vs. mentions of Israeli security Looking more broadly at the content of Clinton’s speech doesn’t do much to support Sanders’ claim. Sanders’ point seemed to be that the Palestinians’ interests were being ignored in Clinton’s speech. So we wondered about how much Clinton addressed the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians and how much she talked about the need to preserve Israel’s security. We thought this would be a reasonable proxy for Sanders’ point, since the peace process includes Palestinians as an integral part of the equation, whereas a focus on Israeli security relegates Palestinians’ safety and security to a lower priority. To look at this question, we made an effort to break down Clinton’s 3,316-word speech by theme. Our choices aren’t unassailable -- some portions of the speech address more than one topic, and different readers may choose to label different sections differently -- but we think it’s pretty good as a rough categorization of what she said.   We settled on five categories. Here they are, along with the number of words we counted for each of those themes: • Preliminary remarks: 238 • Comments about the U.S.-Israel relationship and Clinton’s priorities: 1,148 • Comments about Israel's security: 762 • Comments on Iran or ISIS: 795 • Comments urging the peace process forward (the portion excerpted above): 373 •Total: 3,316 To get a better grasp of this breakdown visually, here’s what her speech looks like by theme. The green section indicates preliminary remarks, the purple denotes U.S.-Israel relations, the gray refers to Iran and ISIS, the light blue denotes Israeli security, and the yellow refers to the peace process.  So by our count, more than 10 percent of Clinton’s comments addressed the peace process, which, as we noted, inherently involves the Palestinians. And if you strip out the preliminaries, the comments on the U.S.-Israel relationship and the comments on Iran and ISIS, the ratio becomes even less favorable to Sanders' point. Comparing just Clinton’s Israeli security comments to her peace-process comments, she spent twice as many words on Israeli security as on the peace process. That’s an imbalance, especially if your goal is ""evenhandedness."" But the imbalance is much more modest than Sanders’ ""one line"" comment would indicate. Our ruling Sanders said that in her AIPAC speech, Clinton ""had one line on the Palestinian people."" She actually had more lines than that -- seven mentions of the word ""Palestinian"" in five sentences. And overall, she spent about 10 percent of her speech talking about the peace process, of which Palestinians are an integral part. That’s still an imbalance -- Clinton spent twice as many words discussing Israeli security -- but Sanders’ assertion is still a significant exaggeration. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEE7AC0>],/factchecks/2016/apr/20/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-hillary-clinton-had-one-line-p/
"['Income', 'Taxes', 'PunditFact', ""Dinesh D'Souza""]","
Dinesh D'Souza incorrectly places Bernie Sanders in the top 1 percent
","After some prodding, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has started to release more tax information. Some of Sanders’ critics say that his 2014 tax returns indicate Sanders doesn’t practice what he preaches. The critics say he paid a low tax rate on a relatively high income, while assailing the country’s ultra-wealthy for not paying their fair share of taxes. These critics include conservative pundit Dinesh D’Souza, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan and a filmmaker. ""As a U.S. Senator with salary and perks, ‪#‎Bernie‬ is in the top 1 percent, but still paid only 13 percent in taxes last year,"" D’Souza wrote on Facebook April 17.  ""Can anyone spell HYPOCRITE?"" As of publication, D’Souza’s post had been shared more than 60,000 times. Given Sanders’ targeted attacks on the top 1 percent, the claim that Sanders is a member of that group caught our interest. The top 1 percent Sanders and his wife Jane reported a combined income of $205,617 for 2014. The vast majority comes from Sanders’ Senate salary — about $174,000 before contributing to savings and benefits — and the rest comes from Social Security benefits. While significantly above the nation’s median household income of about $53,600, Sanders’ income is not high enough to place him in the top 1 percent of earners. We found a few estimates of how much a person has to make break into this top echelon, but all are much higher than Sanders’ reported income. The Wall Street Journal crunched the numbers for 2014 and found that the minimum income to place in the top 1 percent is around $306,000 — about $100,000 more than the Sanders household currently earns. That being said, the Wall Street Journal calculator places the Sanders household in the top 2 percent of earners. Looking at Sanders’ $174,000 Senate salary alone, he’s in the top 3 percent. A calculator put together by Sentier Research for CNN Money puts the Sanders household in the top 6 percent. D’Souza also said Sanders receives enough Senate perks to push his income into the top 1 percent. In a reply comment on his Facebook post, D’Souza mentioned free travel and entertainment as examples of perks. We reached out to D’Souza’s press line multiple times to get more clarification, but we didn’t hear back. To get that additional $100,000-plus worth in perks — to push Sanders into the top 1 percent of earners — he would have to be ""dramatically and egregiously breaking ethics laws and Senate rules,"" said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. The rules on what kinds of gifts senators can receive are stringent, Huder said. For example, senators cannot take gifts, meals or travel reimbursements from lobbyists, foreign agents or their clients. Also, they cannot receive gifts from private citizens of more than $100 a year. ""There really aren't many perks for members,"" he said. ""And without breaking the law, Sanders would have nearly an impossible time collecting enough gifts and travel reimbursement to raise his income to the level of the top 1 percent."" Even things like the member gym require a fee, said Dan Abule, a senior researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. But income is not the only way to calculate wealth distribution. There’s also the measure of net worth, how much a person owns in assets minus their liabilities. Based on his net worth, Sanders falls on the lower end among his Senate colleagues. Estimating a member of Congress’ net worth is challenging because congressional financial disclosure forms offer only broad ranges of income in various categories. Additionally, some holdings are exempt from disclosure, like the value of a primary residence and retirement accounts. Roll Call estimates senators’ minimum possible net worth and found Sanders’ to be $160,000, ranking him as the 19th-poorest senator. The Center for Responsive Politics, conversely, takes a midpoint estimate. The center estimates Sanders’ net worth to be around $463,000, also landing him the spot of the 19th-poorest senator. By either estimate, he does not own nearly enough assets to land in the top 1 percent based on net worth. The Pew Research Center reported that a person would have to have a net worth of at least $2.3 million, based on Census data. 13 percent in taxes Sanders and his wife paid $27,653 in federal taxes, which is indeed about 13 percent of their income, the amount D’Souza mentioned in his Facebook post. This is about what would be expected for the 2014 tax year, according to an E-File tax calculator. (If you’re doing the math at home, Sanders’ taxable income was $140,994, based on his 2014 returns.) But Sanders has reported also paying $7,903 in state taxes in Vermont. So in total, about 17 percent of his household’s income went to taxes, state and federal combined. D’Souza explained in a comment replying to the post that he wasn’t saying Sanders didn’t pay what he owed under the current law. ""Rather, there's a discrepancy between his moral outrage at the rich — who are also paying what they owe — and his refusal to apply that same outrage to his own income,"" D’Souza wrote. Sanders’ proposed tax plan, however, would not affect his income bracket. He would raise the marginal tax rates on households making $250,000 and above. Sanders spokesman Warren Gunnels called D’Souza’s claim ""absurd."" Our ruling D’Souza said, ""As a U.S. senator with salary and perks, ‪#‎Bernie‬ is in the top 1 percent, but still paid only 13 percent in taxes last year."" Sanders and his wife made $205,617 in 2014, which is at least $100,000 short of what they would need to make it into the top 1 percent of earners. And it would be near impossible for Sanders to make up the difference with Senate perks, given the stringent rules against gifts. That being said, Sanders’ household income likely lands him in the top 6 percent or higher of earners, so still significantly higher than the average American. About 13 percent of Sanders’ income went to federal taxes; it’s a little higher if we include state taxes. As far as we can tell, though, he paid what was expected of him under current law. D’Souza far overstates Sanders’ earnings, and he makes unprovable accusations about perks that Sanders receives as a senator. We rate his claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/df9c222b-a9be-40de-a846-78066affc802",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF00FC0>],/factchecks/2016/apr/20/dinesh-dsouza/dinesh-dsouza-incorrectly-places-bernie-sanders-to/

Bernie Sanders ad ignores fact that members of Congress can't be paid for speeches
","A new television ad by Sen. Bernie Sanders describes a very lucrative method for making money if you're a politician in Washington. ""Wall Street banks shower Washington politicians with campaign contributions and speaking fees,"" the ad says. ""And what do they get for it? A rigged economy, tax breaks and bailouts, all held in place by a corrupt campaign finance system. And while Washington politicians are paid over $200,000 an hour for speeches, they oppose raising the living wage to $15 an hour. $200,000 an hour for them, but not even 15 bucks an hour for all Americans. Enough is enough."" The ad was played in New York in the days leading to the state’s April 19 primary.    The ad was clearly going after Sanders' Democratic opponent, former U.S. Sen. and ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who made lots of money giving speeches after leaving government in 2013. Sanders has argued that Clinton can't effectively regulate Wall Street when she has taken so much money from the big banks. But the language of the ad is much broader than that, making three references to Washington politicians in general and twice linking them to a $200,000 per hour payment. In addition, four of the 11 camera shots in the 30-second ad show the United States Capitol building, the headquarters of Congress. There are no shots of the White House or institutions such as the Federal Reserve or the State Department. The clear impression is that Sanders is talking — exclusively or not — about members of Congress, the premiere political class of Washington. Can they really accept more than $200,000 an hour for speeches? The ad is very misleading. Senators and representatives have been prohibited from accepting money for speeches since 1991. Before then, members of Congress would often accept speaking fees from the industries they oversaw, which critics characterized as a form of bribery. And it's not just members of Congress. In the House, for example, even senior staff can't be paid for speeches, appearances or writing an article. Junior staff also can't do it if the topic relates to their official duties. The executive branch has a similar ban. But once a person leaves government service, those rules no longer apply, and they're free to charge for speeches. As we reported a year ago, Clinton was typically earning honorariums of about $225,000 per speech and, in some instances, over $300,000 each. Again, these happened after she left office. When we asked the Sanders campaign about the ad's claim, they sent along a list of links reporting on what some former federal government employees were getting for their speeches. They included: * $100,000-$175,000 for George W. Bush, who insists on a non-disclosure agreement so the sponsors can't say what they paid the former president (Politico). * At least $250,000 for a speech in Abu Dhabi by former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. His predecessor, Alan Greenspan, reportedly received comparable pay to speak at the private Lehman Brothers dinner after he left the Fed (Reuters). But the Sanders camp also sent links to stories about Mitt Romney making $68,000 for a speech (USA Today) and Jeb Bush commanding about $50,000 per talk (New York Times). That's far less than $200,000, and neither has held any significant elected or appointed office in Washington. And none of these people listed by Sanders had any kind of vote in the recent debate over the $15 minimum wage (which also sounds like a veiled shot at Clinton). Finally, we should note that it's a stretch to say that someone who earns $200,000 for a speech is earning $200,000 an hour. Most speeches require some preparation, research and travel time. It's akin to saying that a pastor paid $30,000 a year is earning $577 an hour because that's how long a Sunday service lasts. Our ruling Sanders said in an ad that uses repeated shots of the U.S. Capitol that ""Washington politicians are paid over $200,000 an hour for speeches."" His ad is disingenuous on many levels. Politicians trying to get to Washington, or those who have come from Washington, certainly can earn such fees, but members of the House and Senate and top officials in the executive branch are not permitted to accept payment for speeches. And Sanders' campaign is including politicians who have never served in Washington in any significant capacity. Because the statement contains a small element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/19e74cb2-d6b7-4ba0-8088-ed2767c75a31",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE43C00>],/factchecks/2016/apr/20/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-ad-ignores-fact-members-congress-ca/

'Making A Murderer' lawyer: Wisconsin pays lowest rate to lawyers who defend poor in criminal cases
","The Netflix series Making A Murderer made rock stars of Wisconsin criminal defense attorneys Dean Strang and Jerome Buting, even though Steven Avery, their client and the central figure of the series, was found guilty of murder. The two are doing a speaking tour in North America, to be followed by one in Australia. Strang is getting a TV series. Buting is in demand, too -- and taking a whack at criminal justice in Wisconsin while he’s at it.    While in Belfast to address a European bar association conference, Buting told the Irish Legal News in an April 11, 2016 article that Wisconsin is last in America when it comes to paying lawyers who represent poor defendants in criminal cases. ""We have a staffed indigent defense program statewide, but only about 60 percent of cases are handled by those salaried lawyers,"" Buting said, referring to Wisconsin public defenders, who are state employees. ""The remainder (of the cases) get appointed out to private attorneys on an hourly basis. The hourly basis is $40 an hour. It is now the lowest in the country, worse than the Deep South of America, which has historically been the least generous when it comes to this sort of thing."" He added: ""It’s easy for politicians to demagogue and say ‘we’re going to cut this and cut that,' but what’s happened in Wisconsin should be a warning to Northern Ireland and other countries. I do think that not only lawyers but the public has to stand up to these attempts to try to cut the quality of defense for people accused of crimes."" Leaving aside the question of whether pay affects quality, we found that Buting’s claim is mostly on target. The only caveat is that a complete comparison isn’t possible, given that 20 states don’t use set hourly rates like Wisconsin does. How the system works In Wisconsin, the first line of defense for people who are charged with a crime and can’t afford an attorney is a public defender. But because of heavy caseloads, and for other reasons, public defender offices throughout the state assign some of their cases to private attorneys who have agreed to take such appointments. As Buting said, Wisconsin pays those private attorneys $40 an hour. That amount has not changed since 1995. The $40 is for ""for time spent related to a case,"" in court or out of court, excluding travel. For travel time, the rate is $25 per hour, if the travel meets certain distance requirements.   Other states To back his claim about where Wisconsin ranks, Buting cited a 2013 report from the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. The report said 30 states, including Wisconsin, Iowa and Indiana, had established a statewide pay rate for private attorneys who handle criminal cases, with the average being about $65 per hour. Among those 30 states, the report said, ""Wisconsin has the lowest rate in the nation at $40 an hour."" So, Buting is essentially on track. The report also noted, however, that 20 states don’t set hourly rates. In those states, the pay for the private attorneys is generally either set by a judge on a case-by-case basis, or through a contract between the state and the attorney. But even within some states, there are variations. In Illinois, Cook County (which includes Chicago) pays $40 per hour for in-court and $30 for out-of-court work, while all other counties establish their own rates. In other words, the report doesn’t provide an hourly breakdown for all 50 states. Randy Kraft, spokesman for the State Public Defender in Wisconsin, told us his office in fall 2015 essentially updated the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers report by checking the laws in all 50 states and found no other state hourly rate had slipped below Wisconsin’s. Our rating Buting says Wisconsin pays criminal defense lawyers who represent the indigent $40 per hour, ""the lowest in the country."" According to the latest available data, Wisconsin’s rate was lowest among the 30 states that set hourly rates. But it’s worth noting that the effective hourly rates for the other states couldn’t be determined, because they use different systems. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA1FA80>],/factchecks/2016/apr/20/jerome-buting/making-murderer-lawyer-wisconsin-pays-lowest-rate-/

Lehman says new state Senate district was drawn in secret for Wanggaard within half a block of his house
","
Shortly after his June 5, 2012 recall election victory over incumbent Van Wanggaard was affirmed by a recount, state Sen. John Lehman (D-Racine) said it will be tough for him to win the seat again.

Lehman told WTMJ radio listeners July 10, 2012, that the borders of 21st state Senate District were changed significantly by Republicans in 2011 when they controlled the Legislature. The redistricting is required every 10 years, based on updated census figures, and this was the first time in decades that one party in Wisconsin had complete control over the process.

The seat is up in November 2014, and Wanggaard is expected to run.

""I’m not surprised that he’ll run in the district,"" Lehman said. ""The district was created in secret for Van Wanggaard.  It was drawn within a half a block of his house, around his house two blocks away then went out to western Racine and western Kenosha County down to the Illinois line.""

Sounds like neither Lehman nor Wanggaard should unpack their boxes.

If Lehman and Wanggard face each other in 2014 (or earlier, if there is another recall), it would be the third time the two have run against  each other. Wanggaard topped Lehman to win the seat in 2010. But the next time a much different mix of voters would make the choice.

On July 13, 2011, the Journal Sentinel’s Craig Gilbert took a detailed look at the differences between the new and old 21st Senate district.

""The new plan goes to some extra lengths in reducing the potential for partisan competition,"" wrote Gilbert, author of the Wisconsin Voter blog. ""The most striking example is the transformation of two very competitive districts, the 21st in Racine County and 22nd in Kenosha County, into one very Republican Racine-Kenosha seat to the west and one very Democratic Racine-Kenosha seat to the east.

""Republicans who drew the lines have produced a plan that favors the GOP, which is certainly nothing new for political parties,"" the piece continued. ""Among the state's most competitive districts, the plan gives GOP incumbents Terry Moulton, Joe Liebham and Pam Galloway safer seats and (Alberta) Darling, (Leah) Vukmir and Wanggaard dramatically safer seats.""

In an earlier piece, Gilbert wrote:

""The Wanggaard seat would shed most of the city of Racine and some nearby areas -- wards that voted 63 percent Democratic in last fall's race for governor. (The one section of the city of Racine that's kept in the district is the one where Wanggaard lives.)""

Gilbert calculated that the new 21st was far more Republican, based on the vote in the 2010 governor’s race. Gov. Scott Walker would have won the district by 23 points, rather than 9 points in the old 21st.

Now the map’s borders.

Wanggaard lives in the 1200 block of Blaine Ave. on the west side of Racine. The new border is 13th Ave., just south of his home. That portion of Racine -- Lehman calls it a ""peninsula"" -- lies within the new 21st district.

(Indeed, Lehman’s house is on Orchard St., several blocks away from Wanggaard. His house, too, lies just inside the new district.)

On the ""in secret"" question, GOP lawmakers were allowed to see advance copies of their proposed district maps at the law offices of Michael Best & Friedrich near the Capitol. The Republican lawmakers -- including Wanggaard -- signed confidentiality agreements in which they promised not to disclose the contents of the maps, according to a Feb. 6, 2012, Journal Sentinel article.

Our rating

Lehman says the new 21st State Senate district was ""created in secret for Van Wanggaard. It was drawn within half a block of his house.""

It’s common, of course, for the party in control to draw maps favorable for itself -- and the lines in question here have been approved by the courts. While the points Lehman cites may sound outrageous, even unbelievable, the record shows them to be accurate.

We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA1C0C0>],/factchecks/2012/jul/26/john-lehman/lehman-senate-district-secret-wangaard-house/
"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie: New Jersey gained more jobs in first six months of 2012 than in all of 2011
","
Gov. Chris Christie said his self-proclaimed ""Jersey Comeback"" continues to gain momentum, despite a rising unemployment rate.

At a July 23 news conference in Trenton, Christie said he would like to see the unemployment rate -- which jumped to 9.6 percent in June from 9.2 percent in May -- drop, but cited other labor statistics to show a more optimistic picture of the state’s employment market.

""By the way, the numbers indicate that the comeback is still very strong -- 9,900 new jobs last month. We created as many jobs in the first six months of this year as we did in all of 2011 and 2011 was the best single year for private-sector job growth since the year 2000,"" Christie said.

Is job growth as vibrant as the governor claims? In this fact-check, we are strictly examining whether the numbers are correct, not whether Christie's policies deserve credit for them. We found Christie’s numbers are on target. 
In June, the state added 9,900 jobs overall, including private-sector and public-sector employment. Adding that to the jobs gained since the beginning of the year puts 2012’s total so far at 39,600 jobs overall, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Last year the state gained 31,100 jobs.

So the first six months of job gains in 2012 have already outpaced job growth in 2011 by 8,500 jobs, supporting the governor’s point.

Christie also said ""2011 was the best single year for private-sector job growth since the year 2000.""

That is accurate as well.

New Jersey added 33,400 private-sector jobs in 2011. The year before that, the state gained 10,200 jobs. And in 2008 and 2009 -- in the peak of the recession -- the state lost 224,900 private-sector jobs in total.

Over the last decade, New Jersey only experienced better job growth in 2000 than it did in 2011. In 2000, the state added 64,500 private-sector jobs.

Our ruling

Christie said that ""we created as many jobs in the first six months of this year as we did in all of 2011 and 2011 was the best single year for private-sector job growth since the year 2000.""

So far this year New Jersey added 39, 600 jobs in total. That’s 8,500 more jobs than the state gained in all of 2011.

And in 2011, the state added more private-sector jobs than any year since 2000.

The governor earns a True on this claim.

Pro-Obama super PAC ad says thousands of Chinese workers owe their jobs to Mitt Romney's companies
","
This week, Priorities USA Action, a super PAC aligned with President Barack Obama, released an ad that uses the trappings of the Olympics to make snarky attacks on Mitt Romney.

Against a backdrop of Olympic opening-ceremony footage -- including shots of Romney when he headed the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City -- the ad knocks Romney for allegedly outsourcing jobs and using offshore accounts.

""Welcome to the Olympics,"" the voiceover says. ""There’s Mitt Romney, who ran the Salt Lake City games, waving to China, home to a billion people. Thousands owe their jobs to Mitt Romney’s companies."" The announcer continues with claims about countries where Romney has had bank accounts or corporations. 
In this item, we’ll look at the claim that ""thousands (in China) owe their jobs to Mitt Romney's companies.""

We -- and other fact-checkers -- have looked at some aspects of this issue before. But this claim merely states that thousands of Chinese citizens were employed by companies affiliated with Romney -- a much easier threshold of accuracy to meet, though also an activity that’s not as politically controversial as outsourcing.

When we contacted Priorities USA Action, a spokesman provided documentation that cited five companies -- picture-frame maker Holson Burnes; computer chip manufacturer ChipPAC; information technology companies Modus Media and E5; and GT Bicycle.

For each company, we’ll ask two questions: Is it accurate to call them ""Mitt Romney’s companies""? And did the company have operations in China?

Holson Burnes

• Was it a Mitt Romney company? Yes, as our friends at FactCheck.org have noted, ""Except for a brief leave of absence to run for U.S. Senate in 1994, Romney worked at Bain during the entire time that it owned the Holson Burnes Group, from 1987 to 1995.""

• Did the company have operations in China? Yes. In a 1993 Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the company said it ""maintains foreign production arrangements with over 35 suppliers located in Far Eastern countries including China.""

ChipPAC

• Was it a Mitt Romney company? Maybe. Romney left in February 1999 to run the Olympics. Bain agreed to purchase the ChipPAC one month later in March 1999; the sale was completed in August.

It’s important to note that Romney’s departure from Bain has been a bone of contention between the two campaigns. Romney started Bain Capital in 1984, but did he depart in February 1999, when he joined the Olympics? Or was it in 2002, when he negotiated a retirement agreement that was retroactive to February 1999, according to the Associated Press? 
In a previous fact check, we took a middle ground. We concluded that Romney was not actively involved in the day-to-day management of Bain after 1999, but his influence at the company didn’t drop to zero. We think that applies to ChipPAC because it was purchased soon after he left for the Olympics.

• Did the company have operations in China? Yes. According to a March 16, 1999, article in the Korea Herald, ""ChipPAC has factories in Korea and China.""

Modus Media

• Was it a Mitt Romney company? Yes. As FactCheck.org noted, Modus Media ""was created in December 1997 as a subsidiary of another Bain-controlled company, Stream International Holdings Inc. Modus became an independent company in January 1998."" That was during Romney’s undisputed tenure with the firm.

• Did the company have operations in China? Yes. An SEC filing from 1999 notes that the company had a facility in China. The Romney campaign has noted that ""many"" of the company’s products ""were manufactured in the United States and exported as retail packaged products.  Others were produced at international locations closer to the end users.""

GT Bicycles

• Was it a Mitt Romney company? Yes. The Romney camp acknowledges that Bain invested In GT Bicycles In November 1993.

• Did the company have operations in China? It depends on your definition of ""operations."" The Romney camp acknowledges that Bain ""acquired a company that already had been sourcing certain component parts abroad for years."" An SEC filing said that ""large orders are shipped in containers directly to these distributors from the company's Taiwan and People's Republic of China suppliers,"" and that ""the company's business is highly dependent on products manufactured by foreign suppliers located primarily in Taiwan and Japan and to a lesser extent the People's Republic of China.""

But to us, that sounds more like a client relationship than one in which Chinese workers were actually GT employees. This strikes us as a weaker connection.

E5

• Was it a Mitt Romney company? No. The connection between E5 and Romney is easily the weakest of any on this list. An article in the trade publication Private Equity Week said the company was founded in October 2001. Bain got involved in mid-2002 when an affiliate, Bain Capital Ventures, invested $4 million, the publication reported. That was toward the end of the 1992-2002 period when Romney may have had a limited role with the company.

A Romney adviser told POLITICO that the E5 investment took place ""well after the time (Romney) had any input into investments"" at Bain: ""He didn’t have any involvement in this particular deal.""

• Did the company have operations in China? Yes, but only after Romney was well out of the picture. Bain’s investment was designed to ""develop our China capabilities,"" E5 CEO Gordon Brooks told Private Equity Week, and could have only happened after Romney was gone from the company.

Two more questions

• Did these companies collectively employ ""thousands"" of people in China? It’s plausible. Just counting the three companies where the case is strongest -- Holson Burnes, ChipPAC and Modus Media -- it’s certainly possible that they had employees in the thousands. But nothing we’ve seen reported confirms that, including Priorities Action USA’s backup material.

• Do they employ thousands in China today? This is only relevant because the ad says, ""Thousands (in China) owe their jobs to Mitt Romney's companies"" -- note how ""owe"" is in the present tense. But this is an even more speculative claim than whether these companies ever employed thousands of workers. Here, too, Priorities Action has not provided sufficient evidence.

Our ruling

Two of the companies cited by Priorities Action USA employed workers in China during Romney’s active years as CEO. Another employed workers in China after Romney left to work for the Olympics, but before he severed ties with the company entirely. Two other companies are of questionable relevance for proving the ad’s point.

It’s plausible that the first three companies we looked at employed ""thousands"" of workers in China, but we haven’t seen definitive evidence of that -- much less whether they do today. And Priorities USA Action has not provided sufficient evidence to prove the claim is accurate. On balance, we rate it Half True. 
UPDATE: Shortly after we posted our item, readers informed us that the ad has been taken down from YouTube and from the Priorities USA Action website. It later became clear that it was taken down after pressure was applied by the U.S. Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee. Last we checked, it's still available here, but by the time you read this, it may be gone.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACA7340>],/factchecks/2012/jul/25/priorities-usa-action/pro-obama-super-pac-ad-says-thousands-chinese-work/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama ad says Romney opposed abortion, even in cases of rape and incest
","
To appeal to women voters, Barack Obama's campaign has been attacking Mitt Romney about his position on abortion.

The latest ad, ""Jenny’s Story,"" opens with a woman speaking to the camera.

""I’ve never felt this way before but it’s a scary time to be a woman,"" she says. ""Mitt Romney is just so out of touch."" 
The announcer says, ""Mitt Romney opposes requiring insurance coverage for contraception. And Romney supports overturning Roe vs. Wade. Romney backed a bill that outlaws all abortion, even in case of rape and incest."" 
Back to the woman: ""There’s just so much we need to do. We need to attack our problems. Not a woman’s choice.""

PolitiFact has tracked Romney’s change of position on abortion. In the early 2000s he spoke of a woman’s right to choose. By 2006, he said he was ""pro-life."" For this fact-check, we'll explore if the Obama campaign is accurately describing his position when it says he opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest.

This claim is almost identical to one made in an Obama ad that ran in the first week of July. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org said that ""twisted Romney’s stance."" At the time, the Obama campaign backed up its ad by pointing to a 2007 debate when Romney said he would sign a bill that banned all abortions. But there was no specific bill and no specific language. 
The Obama campaign produced a new ad, but it is not posted on YouTube. We found it on a Washington Post site that tracks campaign ads using data from Kantar Media. The ad changes the claim to say that Romney supported a ""bill"" rather than a ""law.""

This time, the Obama campaign referred us to additional material. In 2004 and 2008, the Republican Party platform backed the ""human life amendment,"" which asserts that legal personhood begins at conception -- and with that comes full constitutional protections. In 2007, Romney said on ABC’s Good Morning America, ""You know, I do support the Republican platform, and I support that being part of the Republican platform and I’m pro-life.""

But the Obama campaign has a problem in extrapolating Romney's position from that comment. Support for the amendment does not necessarily equate to opposing abortion when pregnancy is due to rape or incest.

The National Committee for a Human Life Amendment, a Washington-based advocacy group, has compiled the congressional bills in favor of an amendment dating back to 1973. Some of those bills have no exceptions for rape and incest. However, the most recent versions do.

In 2003 Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo, introduced H.J. Res 9 which held that ""no unborn person shall be deprived of life."" However, the bill adds ""nothing in this article shall prohibit a law permitting only those medical procedures required to prevent the death of the mother of an unborn person: Provided further, that nothing in this article shall limit the liberty of a mother with respect to the unborn offspring of the mother conceived as a result of rape or incest.""

We asked Michael Taylor, Executive Director of the National Committee for a Human Life Amendment, what that bill means.

""I’m not a lawyer,"" Taylor said. ""But the way I read it, there’s an exception for the life of the mother and for cases of rape and incest.""

Taylor’s site lists another occasion in 1989 when the Senate Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on the Constitution approved amendment language proposed by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, that also included exceptions for rape and incest.

These versions predate the Republican Party platforms of 2004 and 2008 that endorse the ""human life amendment."" Rep. Emerson introduced the same amendment with the exception for rape and incest in 2005. So the main versions when Romney made his 2007 remark included the exception. 
More recently, Romney has made clear that he supports the exception for rape and incest. In 2011, Romney explained his position on abortion in an op-ed in the National Review. It begins with ""I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.""

Our Ruling

The ad from the Obama campaign said Romney ""backed a bill that outlaws all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest.""

The Obama campaign provides virtually nothing to back that up, however. It has no evidence that Romney explicitly opposed the exception for rape and incest. While he supported the ""human life amendment,"" there are many versions and the most recent ones allow abortion after rape or incest. And it's worth noting that in 2011, Romney declared that has said he supports those exceptions.

In its effort to appeal to women, the Obama campaign has twisted Romney's position to a ridiculous degree. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC66F40>],/factchecks/2012/jul/25/barack-obama/romney-abortion-rape-incest/
"['Message Machine 2012', 'Stimulus', 'Voting Record', 'Florida', 'John Mica']","
John Mica says Barack Obama ""counted on"" Sandy Adams for stimulus support
","
Things get ugly when two sitting lawmakers vie for the same seat.

This is certainly the case in the Republican primary battle for Florida’s 7th Congressional District.

The Central Florida race features Rep. John Mica, a political veteran with a role in House leadership, and Rep. Sandy Adams, who rode the 2010 tea party wave out of the state Legislature and into Congress.

In a scathing mailpiece, Mica claims he is the right person to represent the reorganized 7th Congressional District because Adams is in cahoots with President Barack Obama.

The piece states in large type, ""Barack Obama counted on Sandy Adams.""

Some more excerpts: Sandy Adams Voted Twice to Approve $8 Billion in Obama Stimulus Spending.

Compare Sandy Adams to John Mica before you vote in the Republican primary.

John Mica is the only Republican in this race to vote against Obama stimulus.

Wait, what? Didn’t Adams, a tea party favorite endorsed by Sarah Palin, come to Washington in 2011? How could she have supported Obama’s 2009 economic stimulus package?

The mailer offers citations, in the form of bill numbers and vote dates, to back up its claims. Such a gesture sometimes gives us hope that truthfulness will be found. Alas, no. Mica’s claim is illogical.

The citations are for annual state budgets the Florida Legislature passed in 2009 (SB 2600) and 2010 (HB 5001). Indeed, Adams, then a member of the Florida House, voted for both.

Lawmakers faced a tremendous budget shortfall in 2009, and part of the way they offset damaging cuts was to accept $5 billion from the federal stimulus program (and through raising taxes and fees on Floridians by $2.2 billion). The same story emerged in 2010, with $2.4 billion from the stimulus program piped in to patch the deficit.

Adams wasn’t the only House Republican to vote for these budgets. The plans sailed through the Legislature along party lines, with Republicans almost unanimously in favor. Democrats who voted against the budget in 2009 called it ""inadequate.""

Adams, who campaigned against government waste like a lot of her GOP contemporaries, referred to the stimulus as a ""failed"" bill in a 2010 Orlando Sentinel op-ed.

Mica’s team says that’s not her real position. ""We needed to let voters know that her record does not match the rhetoric,"" said Mica spokesman Alan Byrd. ""Congressman Mica voted no.""

We have to say, though, we find this line of argument ridiculous.

Using Mica’s logic, that means Obama also counted on Gov. Rick Scott, a high-profile basher of Obama’s stimulus and health care reforms. The first budget Scott signed contained millions of stimulus dollars, after all.

Plus, Adams’ team said Mica is being hypocritical. They pointed to several instances in which Mica, along with eight other House Republicans, voted ""no"" on the stimulus and then publicly campaigned for Florida to receive stimulus money for projects such as high-speed rail just hours later. His critique of it then was that it didn’t spend enough money on transportation projects.

Our ruling

Mica says Obama counted on Adams to approve stimulus spending. That's not the case. Congress approved the stimulus in 2009, before Adams took her seat in 2011. 
Adams did vote for two state budgets that contained stimulus money, as did many other Florida legislators who opposed the federal law. Likewise, Mica himself lobbied for stimulus projects in Florida once the stimulus became law.

Mica's mailer is misleading and hardly offers an apples-to-apples comparison. Adams couldn’t have voted on the stimulus program because she wasn’t even a member of Congress at the time.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg says 40 percent of guns are sold without a background check
","
Editor’s note: We first fact-checked this statement on July 25, 2012, and rated it Mostly True. After the shooting in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14, 2012, other people repeated this statistic, and new criticism of the 40 percent figure emerged. At the request of readers, we looked at the statement again, did additional reporting, and changed our rating to Half True on Jan. 30, 2013. The original item is archived here; the fact-check below reflects our additional reporting and new rating.

As the nation absorbed the news about the shooting deaths in a Colorado movie theater, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was scathing in his criticism of the National Rifle Association. On CBS’ Face the Nation in July 2012, Bloomberg accused the NRA of being ""adamant about no controls on weapons.""
   
He said the pro-gun group leans on Congress and the White House and blocks funding for officials to enforce laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally unstable.
   
""We don't need more laws. We need a couple of fixes,"" Bloomberg said. ""There's a loophole where you can sell guns without a background check at a gun show, 40 percent of guns are sold that way, same thing on the Internet. … The NRA has opposed anything.""

Here, we will check Bloomberg’s statement that ""you can sell guns without a background check at a gun show, forty percent of guns are sold that way, same thing on the Internet."" His phrasing is a little awkward, but his staff told us he meant that 40 percent of guns are sold without a background check, either at gun shows or on the Internet.
   
Current law
   
Buying a gun has required a background check since the Brady Act took effect in 1994. (James Brady was badly wounded during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan; he was Reagan’s press secretary.) Under the law, federally licensed dealers must verify that a buyer has not been convicted of a serious crime or declared mentally incompetent or is blocked for any of about 10 reasons. Typically this is done online and takes less than a day.
   
But only licensed dealers must do this. The law doesn’t apply to private sellers at gun shows, flea markets, or people who post firearms for sale on the Internet. If a private seller suspects that a buyer would be disqualified under federal rules, then they can’t go through with the sale. But there is no background check, and no one needs to file any paperwork.
   
Bloomberg’s office pointed us to a 1997 study by the National Institute of Justice on who owns guns and how they use them.The researchers estimated that about 40 percent of all firearm sales took place through people other than licensed dealers. They based their conclusion on data from a 1994 survey of more than 2,500 households. But it’s important to note that of the 2,568 households surveyed, only 251 people answered the question about the origin of their gun.

We asked Philip Cook, a Duke University professor who co-authored the study, if he thinks that 40 percent estimate -- which is now more than 15 years old -- is still a current, reliable estimate of secondary market gun sales.
   
""The answer is I have no idea,"" Cook said. ""This survey was done almost 20 years ago. … It’s clear there are a lot of transactions that are not through dealers. How many, we’re not really clear on it. … We would say it’s a very old number.""

Other scholars had similar views. Paul Blackman is a retired criminologist and former research coordinator for the NRA Institute for Legislative Action. ""Personally, I think your safest bet is to say that no one knows, but that the vast majority of crime guns come from some other source than gun shows,"" he told us.

On the other hand, not much has changed in the gun market in the past two decades.

""It’s a fairly stable market. That is to say, gun stores have had their part, police supply stores have had their part, and then there are the gun shows and private dealings about which we know very little,"" said Robert McCrie, of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""There’s the knowledge that the market has been more vigorous and probably that higher vigor has been reflected in gun shows and private sales in tandem.""
   
McCrie said, ""The 40 percent seems about right.""
   
Gary Kleck, whose research has provided the foundation for less restrictive concealed carry laws, told PolitiFact the 40 percent estimate is ""probably still reasonably valid today.""

Little other evidence
   
In 1999, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released a report on gun shows. Investigators found that a quarter of the vendors were private sellers, not licensed dealers, and reported that ""felons and other prohibited persons who want to avoid Brady Act checks and records of their purchase buy firearms at these shows."" They said guns from such shows had been used in drug crimes.
   
We called the ATF and asked if there was anything more recent. They had nothing new to add. We called the National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, groups that oppose new efforts to track gun transactions. Neither organization responded.
   
The City of New York commissioned an investigation of Internet gun sales in 2011. The report said on 10 websites, it found over 25,000 weapons for sale.The report said that over 60 percent of sellers allowed a purchase to move forward even when the alleged buyer said he didn’t believe he would pass a background check.

Our ruling
   
Bloomberg said 40 percent of gun sales take place through gun shows or the Internet, without a background check.
   
The best information on the informal gun market is based on a survey and is about 15 years old (the data used in the survey is almost 20 years old). There’s no question that many guns are bought with no background check, but there’s not sufficient current evidence to say that the proportion is 40 percent of all sales.
   
Bloomberg’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out that important detail: Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7E17C0>],/factchecks/2012/jul/25/michael-bloomberg/mayor-michael-bloomberg-says-40-percent-guns-are-s/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Dave Weldon']","
Dave Weldon says Connie Mack missed ""almost half"" of his votes in Congress this year
","
U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, has been criticized for missing votes while campaigning for U.S. Senate.

A Republican rival, former U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon of Indialantic near Melbourne, aired a robocall recently that picked up that story line:

""How angry would you be if you hired someone to do a job and they only showed up half the time? You know -- they only cut half the grass, or they charged you for four hours when they really only worked two? Well, that’s what candidate Connie Mack has done. This year in Congress he has missed almost half of his votes, and now he not only wants to be paid for not showing up, he wants to be promoted into the U.S. Senate.""

We wanted to check if that number was correct.

GovTrack.us tracks missed votes for members of Congress using voting information from the official websites of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. The page on Mack states that throughout his tenure, starting in January 2005 through July 23, 2012, Mack missed 362 of 6190 recorded or roll call votes, which is 6 percent. The median was 2.4 percent.

We noticed that Mack’s percentage of missed votes started to spike in late 2011, when he missed 10.1 percent of votes. Mack announced he was running for Senate in late October 2011, with the goal of taking on Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson.

Since the robocall said he missed almost half the votes ""this year,"" we will focus on Mack’s 2012 record. Below are his votes from Jan. 1 to July 23. 
We shared our findings with Weldon and asked how he concluded that Mack missed ""almost half"" of his votes this year. 
""You know how these things are,"" Weldon said in an interview with PolitiFact. "" I didn’t actually get that. I relied on my staff to research that. It sounds like you did a better job than them.""

Weldon said that the claim might have been based on previous attacks against Mack by George LeMieux, who dropped his Republican U.S. Senate bid in June.

The robocall might not have factored in the second quarter and the portion of the third quarter, Weldon said.

""It sounds like (Mack) is showing up more,"" Weldon said.

Campaign spokesman J.B. Kump said that he didn’t put together the robocall, but it was intended to refer to the first quarter.

""It was something that will probably be corrected in future robocalls if we use that script again,"" Kump said. ""We will try to be more accurate.""

But Kump reiterated the general criticism of Mack saying he has missed too many votes -- in an email he told PolitiFact ""Any discussion of quarters, etc., is just quibbling.""

Kump wouldn’t tell us exactly when or where the robocall aired -- the Tampa Bay Times posted it on its Buzz blog on July 22 and stated that voters heard it in Tampa Bay over the weekend.

American Bridge 21st Century PAC, a Democratic group, said in July that Mack missed about 31 percent of votes based on the first half of 2012. (They arrived at a slightly different figure because they didn’t use the partial data available for the beginning of the third quarter.) 
Mack’s missed votes have made news for several months. The Tampa Bay Times reported in February that Mack missed a series of missed votes, including to repeal part of the health care law. POLITICO noted in April that Mack missed  the high-profile vote on Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget plan.

Mack’s response

Mack’s campaign spokesman David James did not dispute our numbers.

""Mack has a lifetime 95 percent voting attendance record affected by missing some votes to make sure Mitt Romney won the Florida presidential primary in January, something Connie's constituents felt very strongly about when it comes to invoking the change we need in Washington,"" James told PolitiFact.

It’s not unusual for a congressman running for statewide office to miss a high number of votes. The Miami Herald reported in a 2000 story that Nelson missed many votes in 1990 while running for governor. 
Nelson has only missed one vote this year, according to GovTrack, but unlike Mack, he hasn’t faced feisty primary challengers, and the Senate takes fewer votes. 
Our ruling

The Weldon robocall said that Connie Mack ""missed almost half of his votes"" this year. Actually, Mack missed about 28.6 percent of votes this year, which is significantly less than the robocall claimed. The Weldon campaign conceded that they relied on out-of-date information for their attack. 
However, Mack has missed votes. He's missed more votes than the average member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and he's missed high-profile votes on health care and the budget. 
He hasn't missed ""almost half of his votes,"" though. So we rate this claim Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC98B100>],/factchecks/2012/jul/25/dave-weldon/weldon-connie-mack-missed-almost-half-votes/

Biggest tax hike in U.S. history? ""Obamacare,"" says GOP U.S. Senate candidate Mark Neumann
","
Among Republicans, if there’s a topic as hot as the record-breaking heat of the summer of 2012, it’s President Barack Obama’s health care reform law.

""I think it's the worst piece of legislation that's been passed in my lifetime,"" former Republican Wisconsin congressman Mark Neumann said. ""It's stopping business from growing and creating jobs. It's the biggest tax increase in American history, likely to bankrupt this country by spending $2.6 trillion; $500 billion taken out of Medicare; the list just goes on and on and on.""

Neumann, who is running in the August 2012 primary for the U.S. Senate, went on at some length about his first TV ad -- which hits ""Obamacare"" -- during a July 10, 2012 interview with WTMJ-AM’s Charlie Sykes, a conservative talk show host in Milwaukee.

But we’ll zero in on the boldest claim made by Neumann -- that the law is ""the biggest tax increase in American history.""

Neumann’s evidence

Neumann campaign manager Chip Englander cited a July 2010 article by FactCheck.org, a project based at the University of Pennsylvania. It concluded that ""as measured by the rather useless yardstick of raw dollars, with no adjustment for inflation,"" the Affordable Care Act could be the largest tax hike in U.S. history.

At $76.8 billion in 2014, the law would be the largest one-year tax increase in raw dollars since 1968, FactCheck.org said, using U.S. Treasury data.

But Neuman ignores what the article goes on to say: ""that attack is misleading, and the raw-dollar measure is a poor way to measure the size of a tax increase."" The reason is the simple fact of inflation, which means a dollar today is worth less than one years ago.

Adjusting for inflation, a 1982 tax hike under GOP President Ronald Reagan is the largest tax increase ($85.3 billion), and Obama’s health reform law drops to fourth ($71.7 billion), FactCheck.org found.

And using what it called the best yardstick -- the amount of revenue raised in one year as a percentage of gross domestic product -- the health law ranks as the seventh-largest tax hike since 1968.

The article’s conclusion: ""There’s no way the ACA’s tax and other revenue increases come close to being the largest in U.S. history.""

Englander also cited a Forbes opinion column that claims the reform law is the largest tax increase if both the premiums people pay for health insurance and the penalties paid by those who don’t get insurance are considered taxes.

But premiums paid to insurance companies obviously are not the same as taxes paid to the government. 
(On July 24, 2012, Neumann claimed a new Congressional Budget Office analysis found the law will increase taxes by $100 billion ""more than anticipated."" But the analysis focused on the June 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the law, which had effects on Medicaid, but didn’t make major changes to tax provisions. The new analysis found, according to the National Journal, that the law is $84 billion cheaper and that repealing it would worsen the federal deficit by $109 billion over 10 years.) 
Other evidence

Before the FactCheck.org article was published, our colleagues at PolitiFact National also did some digging in rating as Pants on Fire an even bolder claim by Rush Limbaugh -- that the reform law is ""the largest tax increase in the history of the world.""

They found that the health law is tied for fifth among the largest tax hikes between 1968 and 2006 as a percentage of gross domestic product. That includes the law’s penalty for not having insurance.

That makes Obama’s health law a big tax increase, but not biggest.

Our rating

Neumann said ""Obamacare"" is the biggest tax increase in American history.""

But even the article he uses as evidence states flatly that the health care reform law is not the biggest, and that to cite raw dollars, as Neumann does, is misleading. More reliable measures put the law among the largest tax hikes, but not at the top.

We rate Neumann’s statement False. 
Editor's note (July 25, 2012): The original version of this article incorrectly stated that the health reform law (rather than the repeal of it) would add an estimated $109 billion to the deficit.

A 3.8% sales tax on real estate in the health care law? This chain email's claim just won't die
","
Did you get the chain email that claims the health care law will institute a new tax on home sales?

Here’s the email many readers have forwarded to us:

""Under the new health care bill — did you know that all real estate transactions will be subject to a 3.8% Sales Tax? The bulk of these new taxes don’t kick in until 2013 (presumably after Obama’s re-election). You can thank Nancy, Harry and Barack and your local Democrat Congressman for this one. If you sell your $400,000 home, there will be a $15,200 tax. This bill is set to screw the retiring generation who often downsize their homes. Is this Hope & Change great or what? …

""Oh, you weren’t aware this was in the Obamacare bill? Guess what, you aren’t alone. There are more than a few members of Congress that aren’t aware of it either (result of clandestine midnight voting for huge bills they’ve never read). AND, there are a few other surprises lurking.""

The email’s claims are wrong, but that hasn’t stopped people from pressing the forward button. We’ve received copies of this email regularly since 2010. We’ve debunked it before, but since it’s still out there, we’re going to review the facts again now.

The distortion sprouted from Section 1402 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, titled ""Unearned income Medicare contribution."" Legislative wonks might remember that this was the second part of the health care bill, passed via reconciliation so that it only required 50 votes. Democrats had to do it that way after they lost their 60-seat majority due to a special election for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts.

It is a new tax, but it’s not on real estate transactions. Let us explain.

Right now, workers pay Medicare hospital taxes on wages. Workers and employers split a 2.9 percent tax; the self-employed pay all of it.

The health care law imposes a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income, but it only applies to couples who make more than $250,000 or individuals who make more than $200,000. That investment income could include the profits from real estate transactions.

But it would only apply to those high earners, who make up less than 5 percent of all taxpayers.
The new tax marks the first time investment income will be subject to Medicare taxes, said Clint Stretch, the managing principal for tax policy at Deloitte Tax LLP, when we asked him about in 2010.

We should point out that the government currently taxes investment income in various ways and could have simply raised current rates.

But lawmakers wanted to link the new revenues to health care, Stretch said. ""The point of doing it as a Medicare tax was to have the money go to the Medicare trust fund and have it act like a tax that is paying for health care. So there is additional complexity,"" he said.

We’re not sure why the email extrapolates this tax to all real estate transactions, but that’s the only 3.8 percent tax we could find in the new law. We ran this by two tax policy experts who confirmed our analysis.

If you’re an empty-nester of any means, and you’re thinking of downsizing, part of your profits are already tax-free thanks to long-standing tax exemptions on the profits from home sales.

In general, if you sell your own home, individuals are not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit and married couples are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit. Again, that’s profit, not the sales price.

If you’re wealthy and sell your home at a substantial profit, it’s possible you might get hit with the new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. Most Americans won’t have to worry about this, though.

The chain email doesn’t acknowledge any of those pesky facts. It says that a 3.8 percent tax applies to all real estate transactions as a sales tax. That is not the case. The email seems intended to scare people, particularly older Americans thinking of downsizing. For that, we award this chain email a Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE02B80>],/factchecks/2012/jul/25/chain-email/3-8-percent-tax-real-estate-transactions-health-ca/
"['New Jersey', 'Debt', 'Chain email']","
Obama doubled the national debt in one year, chain e-mail states
","
No apologies, just a ridiculous attack on President Barack Obama for doubling the national debt in one year.

With that opening, a chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey kicks off a series of statements about the Democratic president’s record.

""SOME OF YOU MAY APPRECIATE THIS AND SOME OF YOU MAY NOT. I DO NOT APOLOGIZE FOR SENDING THIS, BECAUSE ITS THE TRUTH,"" the chain e-mail states. ""If any other of our presidents had doubled the national debt, which had taken more than two centuries to accumulate, in one year, would you have approved?""

Near the end of the chain e-mail, the message adds: ""Every statement and action in this email is factual and directly attributable to Barrack Hussein Obama. Every bumble is a matter of record and completely verifiable.""

PolitiFact New Jersey already debunked a chain e-mail claim that Obama added more to the national debt in his first term than his 43 predecessors combined -- but doubling the debt in one year?

That brings this claim to a new extreme and, as federal data proves, it’s completely bogus.

The national debt has increased significantly during Obama’s tenure, but it never doubled in one year. The debt hasn’t even doubled over the roughly three and a half years since the president took office.

The chain e-mail includes various other statements about Obama’s time in the White House, from his use of a teleprompter to the gift he gave to the Queen of England. Check out this story from FactCheck.org about all of the claims made in the e-mail.

Now, let’s explain how the national debt has increased under Obama.

There are two commonly cited forms of national debt -- debt held by the public and total debt.

The debt held by the public refers to money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public as well as money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare.

On Jan. 20, 2009, the date of Obama's inauguration, debt held by the public was about $6.3 trillion and total debt stood at roughly $10.6 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s ""Debt to the Penny"" calculator.

A year later, debt held by the public was about $7.8 trillion and total debt was about $12.3 trillion. Those figures represent over-the-year increases of about 24 percent and 16 percent in the respective categories.

Both forms of debt continued to increase in the two subsequent years, but at a declining pace.

Between Jan. 20, 2010 and Jan. 20, 2011, debt held by the public grew by about 20.5 percent and total debt increased by roughly 14 percent.

From Jan. 20, 2011 to Jan. 20, 2012, debt held by the public went up by around 11.3 percent, while total debt increased by about 8.4 percent.

When PolitiFact New Jersey received the chain e-mail on July 10, debt held by the public stood at about $11 trillion and total debt was about $15.9 trillion. Compared to Obama’s inauguration, that’s an increase of roughly 75.6 percent and 49.5 percent, respectively.

So, starting with the inauguration, the largest over-the-year increase in either form of national debt was about 24 percent. Over the course of roughly three and a half years, both forms of debt have risen sharply, but still haven’t doubled.

The factors behind debt increases over the last decade include legislation approved by Obama, such as the stimulus bill signed in February 2009 and tax cuts enacted in December 2010, according to a study released in April 2011 by the nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative.

But other contributing factors were initiated under President George W. Bush, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the analysis shows. Experts also have told us the weak economy has contributed to the higher debt.

Our ruling

A chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey claims Obama ""doubled the national debt, which had taken more than two centuries to accumulate, in one year.""

There’s no doubt that the national debt has increased significantly since Obama took office, but it’s outrageous to claim it doubled in one year.

Starting with his inauguration, the largest over-the-year increase in either form of national debt was about 24 percent. Even after roughly three and-a-half years into his presidency, both forms of debt still have not doubled.

We’re just left with three words to describe this claim: Pants on Fire!

The mayor gets the numbers right on jobs lost
","
For the past two years, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has been one of the most vocal advocates in support of a regional sales tax to pay for more than 150 transportation projects he and proponents say will ease congestion in the region.

Supporters also say the 1 percent tax would jolt the region’s economy by creating jobs for people working on those transportation projects. An earlier claim by tax proponents said that the plan will ""create or support an additional 200,000 new jobs."" PolitiFact found that number gave an inflated impression of the plan's impact, and the jobs-creation claim earned a Mostly False on the Truth-O-Meter.  

Critics say the tax will benefit construction companies and the well-connected, but do little to untangle the region’s transportation gridlock.

Reed’s statement concerned only the number of jobs lost in the economic downturn.

The mayor was very vocal about the need for more jobs during a news conference at City Hall to announce the Atlanta Business League’s support for the July 31 referendum. The sales tax could raise $8.5 billion over 10 years, after inflation.

""The city of Atlanta and the state of Georgia, we’ve lost 200,000 jobs since the year 2007,"" Reed began. ""We’ve lost 50,000 construction jobs since the year 2007.""

We wanted to know if hizzoner has potential as a labor economist. Or are the mayor’s numbers incorrect?

PolitiFact Georgia went to the most commonly used and dependable source of labor data, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For our purposes, we focused on state employment figures.

First, the overall employment numbers. In May 2012, the most recent monthly BLS data available, an estimated 3,930,000 Georgians were employed. In May 2007, the number of Georgians employed 4,139,000, the federal data shows. The difference is 209,000 people.

So far, so good for the mayor.

Now, what about the construction data? In May 2007, the BLS said about 222,700 Georgians were employed in the construction industry. In May 2012, the number dropped to an estimated 141,300 Georgians. The difference: 81,400.

That’s actually more people who’ve lost their jobs in construction than Reed said at the City Hall event.

Real estate has long been a bedrock industry in metro Atlanta with the region’s rapid population growth in recent decades. The Great Recession hurt the real estate industry tremendously. Construction levels dropped nearly 80 percent between 2006 -- its peak year -- and 2010, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2011.

The federal data shows construction employment declined each month between August 2007 and September 2010. Employment rose for a few months in early 2011, but has largely declined since.

As for the overall employment numbers, the decline since 2007 also has been largely blamed on the recession. The number of Georgians employed has increased by about 92,000 since May 2010, the BLS numbers show.

Reed’s overall point is that the region could use the jobs that might be created by these transportation projects. And it is uncertain how many jobs the projects would create.

But the jobs-loss numbers Reed used to back up his argument were correct for the number of total jobs lost since 2007. Reed actually underestimated the total of jobs lost since 2007 in the construction industry.

Overall, we rate his statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBA8300>],/factchecks/2012/jul/25/kasim-reed/The-mayor-gets-the-numbers-right-on-jobs-lost/

Sherrod Brown campaign says Josh Mandel has accepted zero proposed debates
","
It seems a tad silly for PolitiFact Ohio to wade into a debate on debates, long a rhetorical rite of passage for dueling candidates immersed in the summer doldrums of a fall campaign.

But Sen. Sherrod Brown and his re-election campaign ratcheted up the rhetoric about this time-worn tradition as it settled a debate date for the City Club of Cleveland.

In the morning on July 19, Friends of Sherrod Brown announced with a tone of urgency that Brown had accepted an invitation to debate Republican challenger Josh Mandel sometime in October at the City Club. Two dates -- Oct. 1 or 8 -- were on the table, Brown’s camp said.

""BREAKING: Sen. Sherrod Brown Accepts City Club Debate In Cleveland, Urges Josh Mandel To Do The Same,"" was the headline on the news release emailed by the campaign.

Mandel’s spokesman, Travis Considine, told The Plain Dealer that same morning that Mandel had agreed to a City Club debate, just not a date. Considine also said Mandel intended to participate in debates proposed in Columbus and Zanesville.

Less than two hours later the Brown campaign volleyed back with a blistering news release. The email, from the headline on down, strings together a number of claims. PolitiFact Ohio homed in on the overarching message, expressed in one of three bullet points.

""When Josh Mandel claims to have accepted three debates with Sen. Sherrod Brown, he is lying. He has accepted ZERO proposed debates.""

Really?

The Mandel campaign provided a letter dated July 16 in which City Club Executive Director James Foster thanks Mandel ""for accepting our invitation to a debate."" The letter said a date was to be determined, but by all accounts Oct. 3 was the early choice.

On July 17,  the City Club’s Carrie Miller notified representatives of both campaigns via email that officials wanted to reschedule after realizing the first presidential debate also had been set for Oct. 3. She offered the campaigns two alternate dates: Monday, Oct. 1 or Monday, Oct. 8.

Brown quickly sent word that he would debate on either day. This brings us to the back-and-forth on July 19.

Miller told PolitiFact Ohio that the Mandel campaign had ""never indicated that they were not going to participate in a debate."" Brown’s news releases, though, create quite the opposite impression.

In an interview July 23, Sadie Weiner, press secretary for the Brown campaign, said that campaign officials were unaware Mandel had accepted the City Club’s original invitation. But Weiner also argued that Mandel’s campaign was out of bounds in referencing the two other proposed debates. She even pointed to a Mandel campaign Tweet that said he had ""agreed to 3 debates.""

Weiner reasoned that it was ""disingenuous"" for Mandel to imply he had committed to more debates than Brown had by referencing two forums that had yet to even be penciled in on a calendar.

Then again, the same could be said of the City Club debate. Mandel had agreed to one date, only to have the City Club request a new one. There was no reason to think Mandel would not reschedule. Indeed, by the afternoon of July 20, both sides had agreed to an Oct. 15 showdown.

And the Brown campaign acknowledges that the Mandel camp raised the possibility of other debates through one of the debate organizers.

Bottom line: There’s no evidence to dispute that Mandel was agreeable to at least three debates.

Had you known none of this backstory, you might come away convinced that Mandel was shying away from the debate.

You see, Mandel caught grief in February for skipping a City Club forum with five of his lesser-known GOP primary opponents. At the time he vowed to meet Brown in the fall at a City Club debate.

The Brown campaign said that when Mandel claimed to have accepted three debates, he was lying, and that he has accepted ""zero proposed debates.""

That’s clearly not accurate.

The letter from the City Club dated July 16 shows that Mandel had agreed to that debate. And the Twitter posting and comments to The Plain Dealer, indicate a willingness to have two others. The Brown campaign confirms that possibility had been raised, too.

It appears that the Brown campaign aimed here to cast Mandel as dishonest and scared of a debate all at once.

But on the Truth-O-Meter, the campaign’s claim rates Pants on Fire. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7E6880>],/factchecks/2012/jul/25/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-josh-mandel-lying-debates/

Barack Obama says Mitt Romney's tax plan ""would cut taxes for the folks at the very top""
","
After a flurry of attack ads in the past two weeks, President Barack Obama this week released a TV ad in which he spoke directly into the camera and discussed how his policy approaches differed from Mitt Romney’s. He cited taxes as one area where they had different philosophies. Obama said, ""Gov. Romney's plan would cut taxes for the folks at the very top.""

We’ll check whether this is an accurate characterization of Romney’s plan.

Romney has posted some key elements of his tax plan on his campaign website. Here’s a summary of the provisions for individual taxpayers:
   
• Cut marginal rates by one-fifth on a permanent, across-the-board basis
• Eliminate interest, dividend, and capital gains taxes for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income below $200,000
• Eliminate the estate tax
• Repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax

To analyze the Romney tax cut, we turned to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent think tank that evaluates the tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates. The Tax Policy Center looked at two versions of Romney’s tax proposal. We will use the analysis of the more recent of Romney’s two plans, which the group published in March 2012.
   
The Tax Policy Center ran two sets of numbers, one that gives Romney credit for extending the tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush and for an annual adjustment in the Alternative Minimum Tax and one that doesn't. 
Under the analysis that gives Romney credit for extending the Bush tax cuts and the AMT, people in each of the 11 income ranges in the center’s study saw a tax cut, with after-tax income increasing by anywhere from 0.3 percent for people who earn less than $10,000 to 19.8 percent for people earning more than $1 million per year. 
Under the other measurement, which we find is more appropriate, people in eight of the 11 income ranges got cuts -- all except the income ranges below $30,000. For those earning more than that, after-tax income would increase by anywhere from 0.8 percent for those in the $30,000 to $40,000 range to nearly 12 percent for those earning more than $1 million.

So Obama is telling part of the story. Yes, there are substantial benefits for people at the top, but he ignores that most people in the middle and lower reaches of the income ladder would benefit as well. Using the calculation that does not give him credit for the Bush and AMT extensions, people earning from $40,000 to $50,000 would see a cut of $512 on average, while taxpayers in the $50,000-to-$75,000 range would see a cut of $1,122.

Still, there is support for Obama's point because the Romney tax cuts are tilted toward the wealthy. The biggest winners under Romney’s tax plan are those earning more than $1 million. That group accounts for less than 1 percent of all taxpayers, but would receive 26 to 31 percent of the Romney plan’s tax benefits, according to the Tax Policy Center's calculations.

Our ruling 
Obama is correct that Romney’s plan does indeed cut taxes for high-income Americans -- quite heavily in fact -- but the rich aren’t the only ones who would see a cut. Taxes would be reduced in lower income ranges, too. Still, the plan gives a large share of the benefits to higher income taxpayers. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA65FC0>],/factchecks/2012/jul/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-mitt-romney-tax-plan-would-cut/

Greg Abbott says state proved in court that more than 200 dead people voted in the latest Texas elections
","
Greg Abbott, defending the state’s stalled voter identification law, said in a Fox News interview on July 15, 2012: ""What we have proved in Texas is that voter fraud exists. We have more than 200 dead people who voted in the last election -- and we proved that in court in addition to the fact that the voter ID law will have no disenfranchisement effect on the voters in the state of Texas.""

We’ll set aside the last part of the Texas attorney general’s statement given that a federal judicial panel is reviewing the state’s case challenging the U.S. Department of Justice, which maintains that the state’s mandate that voters present photo IDs at the polls, passed into law in 2011, would prevent many voters from making it to the polls. The department’s objection has kept the law from taking effect.

We were curious about Abbott’s claim that the state proved in the court showdown that more than 200 dead people voted in the latest election.

To our inquiry, Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean passed along a fact sheet from Abbott’s office related to the just-completed trial. By email, Bean said an official with the Texas secretary of state’s office, which oversees elections, testified that it had found 239 people who voted in the May 2012 primaries ""who were actually dead when they supposedly voted.""

Bean also forwarded a transcript of the trial proceedings of July 9, 2012, including questions posed by Adam Mortara, a Chicago lawyer representing the state, to Brian Keith Ingram, director of the secretary of state’s elections division.

Mortara initially asked Ingram if he had evidence of deceased voters having their voter registration cards used in the May primaries. Ingram replied that he compared a list of 50,000 deceased Texas voters registered with ""active voter unique identification numbers"" to who voted in the May 29, 2012, party primaries.

By email, Bean told us a list presented by the Justice Department at the trial identified 57,718 registered Texas voters as deceased. Bean said the comparison of that list to reports of who voted in the 2012 primaries revealed that 239 voter identification numbers belonging to deceased registered voters were used to cast ballots.

Ingram put it this way in his testimony: ""We believe 239 folks voted in the recent election after passing away"" including, he said, 213 who voted in person.

Mortara: ""Have you done anything beyond that to confirm whether there are in fact deceased individuals who voted in the May elections?""

Ingram: ""Well, this was, of course, a surprising and troubling result so we took the best matches, the ones that had full nine Social Security number(s) in both databases, and we asked the Department of Vital Statistics to provide us with actual death certificates for as many of those as we could round up in a short time and we received 10 death certificates.""

Mortara: ""Of the 10 death certificates you received how many of them do you think may have been dead people who voted in the May elections?""

Ingram: ""Four.""

Mortara: ""And what led you to conclude from review of the death certificates that those four people had voted?""

Ingram: ""Their Social Security numbers matched, the names matched, the date of births matched and they pre-deceased before, they pre-deceased before the election. One (in) March of 2012, the rest of them from 2004, 2006, 2009.""

What happened with the other six seeming matches? By email, Bean told us that based on Ingram’s testimony and a conversation she had with the secretary of state’s office, at least one identifier -- a Social Security number, birth date or name -- ""didn't match up completely on the death certificate.""

Ingram further said the state had not conducted such an investigation before because officials had not had both a list of active voter registration numbers belonging to deceased Texans plus a complete record of who had voted in statewide elections.

Bean later told us by email that the 2011 Legislature voted to require counties to tell the state which voters had cast ballots after each primary, runoff or general or special election. Previously, she said, some counties voluntarily shared partial voting histories. So, the May 2012 primaries proved the first time every county had to send such information to the state, which hence was able to compare who voted in the primaries to the list of deceased voters identified by the Justice Department, she said.

Mortara asked Ingram: ""Does the investigation you performed on the May voting data tell you anything about the prevalence of in person voter fraud of this type?""

Ingram replied: ""It tells us that it's more common than we thought...""

Under questioning from Elizabeth Westfall, a Justice Department attorney, Ingram referred to the four voters who used registration cards belonging to dead Texans as the ones he could confirm, but also said that’s being ""very conservative."" He said that all 239 would be referred to Abbott’s office. He agreed, though, that there had been no criminal investigations, prosecutions or convictions.

Westfall asked if clerical errors could explain the 239 matches. Ingram said either the county reports of who voted in May or the state’s list of deceased residents could have errors. ""I hope that that is the case for the majority of these,"" he testified, ""but I know for four of them, it's not.""

We sought to interview state election officials about Ingram’s testimony. Rich Parsons, spokesman for the Secretary of State’s office, directed us to Abbott’s office, saying by email that the 239 ""cases"" have been referred to the attorney general’s office for possible investigation.

We also asked the Department of Justice about Abbott’s claim. Spokesman Mitchell Rivard declined comment.

Asked how the testimony proved Abbott’s claim, Bean stressed that Ingram spoke under oath. She added by email: ""The dead voter number was subject to cross examination by judges, DOJ lawyers and lawyers for groups hostile to Voter ID.""

Our ruling

Abbott said the recent trial proved that more than 200 dead people voted in the latest elections, the May 2012 party primaries.

But the trial was less conclusive. 
To recap: An elections official testified that after comparing a list of 50,000 dead registered voters -- where’s that headline? -- to records of voters in the recent primaries, ""we believe"" that 239 ""folks voted in the recent election after passing away,"" meaning 239 voters cast ballots using voter registrations of dead Texans. According to his testimony, the state then took the best matches and sought death certificates ""for as many of those as we could round up in a short time."" Ten death certificates came back and, the official testified, four names, birth dates and Social Security numbers completely aligned on the lists and death certificates.

We can see how this information might raise flags, but we do not see that it proves there were more than 200 dead voters, so to speak. That's because there’s a difference between suspecting fraud and proving it. After all, Abbott's office has been handed the 200-plus matches to investigate.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Adan Ballesteros']","
Adan Ballesteros says Michael Cargill was “arrested and incarcerated in Bell County""
","
A political flier directed to voters in north and northwest Travis County claims to tell ""the truth about Michael Cargill, candidate for Travis County Constable"" -- and depicts him in an orange jumpsuit.

The mailout, which states it was paid for by the Re-Elect Adan Ballesteros campaign, says among other claims that Cargill was ""arrested and incarcerated in Bell County,"" and it lists a case number.

We decided to wade again into the tumultuous race for Travis County Precinct 2 constable, in which Ballesteros and Cargill are opponents in a Democratic primary runoff election July 31, 2012. In June, we examined a political action committee’s claim linking incumbent Ballesteros to drug money, but we found conflicting, unresolvable information and left the statement unrated.

As we began our look at this claim, we ran a LexisNexis background check of public records and commercially available data sources. The search found no criminal convictions in Cargill's past.

Asked for backup, Ballesteros emailed us copies of Bell County records, a black-and-white mug shot and a letter from Lt. Chuck Cox, custodian of records for the Bell sheriff’s office. We confirmed that the documents came from Cox and county clerk Shelley Coston, and we got descriptions of the case from Cox and Kathryn Brock-Jones, manager of the county attorney’s Hot Check Office. We also received screen shots of the remaining records in the 1999 case, which are computerized, from Tina Syme, criminal department supervisor at the county clerk's office.

According to the records and our email and phone interviews with Syme, Brock-Jones and Cox, Cargill was arrested May 18, 1999, on a warrant stemming from a 1997 bad check charge. He was taken to the Bell County jail, paid the money he owed on the check and was released from the jail the next day, and the misdemeanor charge was dismissed.

There was no conviction and Cargill’s time at the jail was not time ""served"" as punishment, Cox told us. In fact, Cox said, Cargill was immediately eligible to have it erased from his record.

Cox confirmed that the records show that Cargill was physically in the jail overnight.

Brock-Jones told us that Cargill was charged with issuance of a bad check, a Class C misdemeanor, rather than the more serious charge of theft by check. That plus the fact that Cargill had no history of bad checks, she said, means that his case likely involved only one check of a small amount, around $20.

We wondered, too, about the front of Ballesteros’ flier depicting Cargill in an orange jumpsuit.

Cox called the image of Cargill in the orange outfit a ""fabrication."" Cargill’s real booking photo is a black-and-white Polaroid showing him wearing civilian clothes, Cox told us -- which also was the image Ballesteros emailed us when we asked for his backup documentation. At the time Cargill was detained, Bell County used orange uniforms solely for suspected felons, Cox said. 
  
As we gathered these accounts, we also checked in with Cargill, who initially told us he was not arrested or jailed.

Cargill told us by phone that the original check, which he said was for $20, bounced from a checking account he had closed before he deployed to Bosnia with the U.S. Army. Overseas, he said, he did not receive the notification that Bell County would have sent him once the hot check was reported.

When he returned from Bosnia, he said, he was unaware of the warrant until he was pulled over while driving because ""my little Chihuahua who was sitting in the middle of the center console was blocking my view,"" he said. ""They ran my license; that popped up, and I went down, we took care of it. I didn't even know that was there because, like I said, you know, I was deployed. ... Never saw a judge, any of that. Didn’t go to court. Nada.""

In a follow-up interview, he agreed that his trip to the jail amounted to an arrest, but, despite what officials had told us based on Bell County records, he said he was not in the jail for a day. ""I was only there a few hours,"" he said. ""I know I was not there 24 hours. I was not there, you know, a full day, I know that for a fact. One hundred percent.""

Cargill disputed Ballesteros’ word ""incarcerated"" as well. ""Incarcerated means convicted and spent time,"" he said. ""I was never incarcerated."" Cargill told us he would say he was ""detained.""

Merriam-Webster gives two definitions of ""incarcerate,"" the first being ""to put in prison"" and the second being ""to subject to confinement.""


Our ruling

We suspect most people would interpret Ballesteros’ phrase ""arrested and incarcerated"" to mean Cargill served time as punishment for a crime -- which he did not, as our background check suggested. Nor did Cargill wear the garish jumpsuit shown on the flier.

But Cargill was brought to the jail on a warrant for his arrest and held there briefly -- perhaps overnight -- before the charge was dismissed.

Candidate says state hired Vanderbilt alum to make department of economic development Sharia compliant
","
Woody Degan, an East Shelby businessman challenging state Senate Majority Leader Mark Norris, R-Collierville, in the Republican primary in District 32, is making several bold claims in his campaign. 
In an interview with The Commercial Appeal, he claimed there is an effort under way to make the state’s economic development agency ""Sharia compliant."" He contends that Gov. Bill Haslam has appointed a director at the state Department of Economic and Community Development (ECD) who Degan says specializes in ""Sharia compliance"" and is working to make the agency ""Sharia compliant"" in order to ""go after Sharia money.""

Here is but one of the full from Degan: ""They’re making our Economic Development department Sharia compliant. They hired Samar Ali, who came directly from the Obama administration, who specializes in Sharia compliance. That’s what her job is.""

Degan repeated those charges at a candidate forum in Shelby County on Sunday, July 22, specifying again that the official in question is Samar Ali, ECD’s director of international development. Degan is not the only person attacking Ali -- eight county-level Republican committees have passed resolutions denouncing the governor’s appointment and demanding that Ali be fired, which Haslam has refused to do.

So we decided to look into the matter.

At its simplest, Sharia law is the moral code and religious law of the Islamic faith, addressing a variety of personal and secular topics. Aspects of Sharia law do govern business dealings, and some Muslims conduct business only under Sharia-compliant conditions. For example, Sharia may prohibit interest on loans, considering it usury, but may allow other lending fees in lieu of interest. Some people believe that Muslims are trying to incorporate Sharia law in the United States.

In his attack on ECD and Samar Ali, Degan is echoing those groups that have attacked the governor’s appointment, largely because Ali is Muslim. She was a White House Fellow in 2010-11 and her resume includes work as a lawyer in a U.S. law firm’s Abu Dhabi office that involved Sharia-compliant business transactions – which is routine in many Middle Eastern countries.

Degan spent eight minutes, in a 42-minute recorded interview, talking about Sharia and Ali. Among his assertions:

--""Our governor several weeks ago appointed Samar Ali straight from the Obama administration to the top position in the Tennessee economic development department . . . so we’re preparing our state for Sharia money to come in.""

--""By Sharia law, 20 percent of all proceeds from their profits have to go to their mosques, many of which support jihad . . .  We’re going to let them bring it into Tennessee and let those proceeds go back to kill our boys.""

--""They’re making our economic development department Sharia compliant. Why would you make it Sharia compliant if you weren’t going after Sharia money?""

Degan’s most specific allegation regarding Ali is that she ""specializes in Sharia compliance, financial compliance. That’s what her job is . . . and that’s what she was brought into Tennessee for.""

Clint Brewer, ECD’s assistant commissioner for communications, wrote in an email that Degan’s assertions are false.

""Samar Ali was hired to be ECD’s international director. Her job duties are to manage the TNTrade export program and to supervise our four international offices in Germany, Japan, China and Canada."" He added: ""There is no part of her job -- or any department operations -- that involves Shariah compliant finance or Shariah law.""

Brewer also said there is no such effort under way, or planned, to make the agency Sharia compliant. ""None whatsoever nor will there be any,"" he said.

Ali was born in Nashville and raised in Waverly, Tenn., the daughter of two medical doctors who emigrated from the Middle East when they were young. She is a graduate of Vanderbilt University and its law school. An article on the Vanderbilt Law School website in 2010 summarized her accomplishments when she was selected as one of 13 members of the 2010-11 class of the prestigious White House Fellow program:

""During her freshman year, she co-founded the Middle Eastern Students Association and began her three-year involvement with Vanderbilt’s Student Government Association by joining the multicultural committee and the SGA Future Leaders Program. Just two days after the Sept. 11 attacks, Ali rose to an unofficial leadership position by speaking publicly about her Muslim faith and her religion's condemnation of the perpetrators' action. She was the university’s first Arab-Muslim student body president.""

Mike Newton, a Vanderbilt professor who supervised a project Ali completed on comparative human rights in Islamic societies, was quoted in the article that, ""Samar was an amazingly well-rounded and poised student who added a very valuable perspective to our student body and to the International Law Practice Lab.""

When asked what evidence he had to back up his assertions about Sharia law at ECD, Degan said, ""Her specialty is Sharia law and when she was put into that position as a Sharia law expert, it certainly raises questions and concerns about it. The evidence is in what she does…. I’m concerned, yes. Do I have evidence? No.""

Degan later emailed us a more elaborate response that included several attachments from the far-right blogosphere in opposition to Ali’s appointment. He wrote, ""Evidence?  Well, I agree, not until it starts happening is there actual concrete evidence.""

Our ruling

A candidate in the Republican primary for state Senate made strong charges aimed at the state’s economic development department, saying that it had hired a woman specializing in Sharia law in order to make the department Sharia compliant. But even Degan admits he has no evidence.

The department itself strongly denies the allegations and says Ali will have no involvement in Sharia compliance or Sharia transactions. Whether some like Degan in the Republican party feel it is necessary to attack the governor’s office for hiring a Muslim is up to them, but for making a claim that lacks evidence, we rate Degan’s statement Pants On Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC879A40>],/factchecks/2012/jul/24/woody-degan/candidate-vanderbilt-state-sharia/
"['Georgia', 'Transportation', 'Steve Brown']","
Transportation tax foes' number-crunching flawed
","
Opponents of a sales tax to fund transportation projects across metro Atlanta have no shortage of ways to say the plan is a waste of your money.

They say you can’t trust the government to manage the billions of dollars that the 10-year, penny-per-dollar sales tax would raise. They say the tax plan, otherwise known as T-SPLOST, is bloated with projects that won’t ease the region’s notoriously bad traffic.

This statement by Fayette County Commissioner Steve Brown was especially alarming:

""If you take the cost of all of the T-SPLOST transit projects combined, the transportation referendum would spend $90,000 to take a single vehicle off the road during the a.m.-p.m. commute,"" Brown said during a July 12 forum hosted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Ninety thousand dollars?

Heck, who needs the tax? Pay us PolitiFact Georgia scribes $90,000 each, and we’ll walk up the Connector to work.

Brown and Bob Ross, a tax foe who was not on the panel, explained their estimate.

First, they tallied the combined cost of all of the transit projects that the tax would fund: $3.16 billion.

Next, they calculated how many cars these transit expansions would take off the road.

The Atlanta Regional Commission, the region’s planning authority, projects that the additional transit capacity will increase boardings by 74,800 per day.

Brown and Ross divided this number by two. Commuters need to board a bus or train at least twice a day: Once to get there, and once to get back.

That’s 37,400 cars off the road --  a conservative estimate, Brown and Ross said. If a rider has to transfer trains or buses, the daily commute may take four or more boardings.

The per-car cost is therefore $3.16 billion divided by 37,400 cars.

That’s about $84,500, less than the $90,000 that Brown used in his claim. Still, pretty close.  

Brown and Ross also sent us calculations they say demonstrate that $90,000 is far too low. The true cost of taking one car off the road is $105,000, they said. (They used a similar method but added in certain maintenance costs.)

Brown’s approach has flaws.

Brown arguably cherry-picked favorable data to prove his point. Of the $3.16 billion the tax would spend on transit projects, only $2.4 billion would fund the expansions that would increase boardings by nearly 75,000 per day.

Much of the rest is to maintain current service, such as commuter bus run by the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, ARC spokeswoman Julie Ralston said. The ARC projects that service will go out of business without the tax, forcing riders to take to the roads.  

The money also funds system maintenance. 
Experts told us it's possible that If commuters think the trains are unsafe or break down too often, they might retreat to their cars.

Brown thinks such an argument is absurd.

Others pointed out that Brown’s calculation has worse problems.

Tallying the costs and benefits of a transportation project is a complex process. There are many different approaches, but experts often take into account impacts on the economy, the environment, traffic flow, safety and even noise.   

We found Brown’s more simple approach may vastly overstate and understate the problem at the same time.

One reason is that the transit infrastructure will last for generations.

Brown’s calculation uses a single day of boardings. A more fair one would count the boardings over the next few decades.

The Federal Transit Administration’s rule of thumb is that rail facilities last at least 50 years, according to data on its website, while trains last about 25 years.   

Factor in those future boardings, and the cost for transit to keep a car off the road could be lower than $5 or greater than $13 per day.

That may be too high for voters to stomach, but it’s a far less alarming figure than $90,000.  

Even then, such a calculation ignores crucial factors that planners consider when they perform a cost-benefit analysis of transit, such as more commerce and less air pollution, said Robert Cervero, a professor of city and regional planning at the University of California, Berkeley.

""Any numbers based on anything less than a full benefit and cost accounting is, in my view, mostly ideologically driven and propaganda,"" Cervero said.

Another weakness of Brown’s claim is that over the long term, the transit expansion might not reduce congestion at all.

Decades of research also shows that neither transit nor more highway lanes end gridlock, either, PolitiFact Georgia found in a previous story. Over time, drivers fill up the new lanes. Once again, they’re stuck in traffic.

In sum:

Brown based his calculation on a transit cost estimate that’s open to accusations of cherry-picking. Furthermore, even Brown and Ross think their own number falls short.

The claim is so simplistic that it may overstate and understate the cost at the same time.  

Brown’s claim is wrong on various levels. It earns a False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA98D40>],/factchecks/2012/jul/24/steve-brown/Transportation-tax-foes-number-crunching-flawed/
