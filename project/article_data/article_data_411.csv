"['National', 'Elections', 'Fred Thompson']","
Driving his truck to victory
","Yes, it's true. Fred Thompson combined his folksy charm (the truck) with a set of conservative principles (less government, lower taxes, more free markets) to win election to the U.S. Senate in 1994.
 
And, indeed, in February of that year Thompson trailed Democrat Jim Cooper by 19 points — 36 to 17 percent — according to polling at the time by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research.
 
Thompson went on to win the race, which was a special election to complete the term of Al Gore who became vice president, with 60 percent of the vote to Cooper's 39 percent (a 21 percentage-point spread). Thompson won re-election to a full term two years later, defeating Democrat Houston Gordon, 61 to 37 percent.
 
The truck played a role for the lobbyist and actor. He leased it to campaign in the state, building his down-home bona fides among voters.
 
In the same speech Thompson also pointed out, correctly, that President Bill Clinton won Tennessee twice. But it's worth noting that Thompson's first victory, 1994, came in a tidal wave year for Republicans, who took control of Congress.
 
""That was kind of a watershed year in Tennessee,"" said Brad Coker, managing director of Mason-Dixon.

"['National', 'Energy', 'Mitt Romney']","
Difficult to go it alone on energy
","On Sept. 19, 2007, Republican candidate Mitt Romney delivered the standard
Republican stump speech decrying big government and advocating lower
taxes. He criticized members of his own party for spending too much
and said the United States is too dependent on foreign oil.
 
""It doesn't make sense to me to send $1-billion a day out of our
country,"" Romney said. ""We can be energy independent and should be.""
 
Everyone agrees with Romney that U.S. dependence on foreign oil is not a
good thing. But that's where the accuracy of his comment ends, experts say.
 
If Romney had said we ""should"" be energy independent he might be able to get
away with it. But he chooses to be more emphatic, saying we ""can"" be. At the moment, that's not so.
 
American presidents have been promising to make the United States more fuel-independent for decades, says Mike Rodgers, a leading oil expert with
PFC Energy in Washington. When Richard Nixon made that pledge during
the Arab oil embargo in 1973, Rodgers says the United States relied on foreign oil
for 35 percent of its daily consumption. Now, 34 years later, the United States gets more than 60 percent of its energy from foreign oil supplies.
 
Electricity needs are not the issue. A combination of hydroelectricity, nuclear power and coal makes the United States relatively self-sufficient on electricity consumption. But our massive transportation sector consumes vast quantities of oil, and much of it comes from outside our borders. Imports have risen in the United States for the simple reason that with population growth our consumption has risen while our domestic production has dropped. For example, Alaska production is half what it was in the 1980s when the giant Prudhoe Bay field was at its peak.
 
Given available resources and existing technology, Romney's statement about becoming energy independent is little more than a pipe-dream, experts say.
 
""It's possible, just not likely,"" says David Rothkopf, president of
Washington, D.C.-based consultancy Gartner Rothkopf LLC and a leading
expert on energy issues. ""It's not realistic. His heart is in the
right place but I think he needs to look at the facts.""
(Rothkopf was a former deputy undersecretary of commerce for international trade policy in the Clinton administration.)
 
Rothkopf and others say that while the nation could conceivably achieve
energy independence in the long term, it's just not realistic in the
near term.
 
For the United States to achieve energy independence would take
massive investment in a range of options, from new conservation
technology, next-generation biofuels, hydrogen fuel cells, plug-in
hybrids, as well as aggressively seeking fossil fuel resources in the
United States.
 
Most of the newer technologies are not yet commercially viable, though they do hold
great potential.
 
The real focus, experts say, needs to be on energy security, not
independence, i.e., ensuring that we get our energy from a sufficiently
diverse number of countries and different technologies, to reduce our
vulnerability to political shocks and natural causes
like hurricanes and climate change. Experts call this ""energy
interdependence.""
 
T. Boone Pickens Jr., the Oklahoma oil tycoon, offered this
solution in an interview in September 2007 with the

Pittsburgh Tribune Review

:
""You can't become energy independent. That's out of the question
because you're importing 60 percent of the oil that you use every
day. ... If everybody in the United States started riding a bicycle,
it'll work.""

"['National', 'Iraq', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama has consistently opposed the war
","Obama opposed the war as a little-known state senator, and spoke out notably at a Chicago anti-war rally in 2002. In 2003, when he began campaigning for the U.S. Senate seat for Illinois, he reiterated his opposition in several debates and meetings.
 
In other words, Obama's sweeping claim to have long opposed Iraq is true.
Opponents have attacked Obama's record of opposition on two grounds. They argue that Obama should answer definitively how he would have voted if were in the Senate at the time of the vote. Obama said in 2004 he can't answer that question fully because he doesn't know what intelligence the senators had access to.
 
Opponents also have taken comments of his out of context to suggest he supported the war, particularly his 2004 statement that ""There's not much of a difference between my position and George Bush's position at this stage."" But that quote is pulled from a story in which Obama expresses a sentiment that now that the war has started, the U.S. should do the best job it can to steer Iraq toward stability.
 
Obama joined the U.S. Senate in 2005. He has voted several times to continue funding for the war, saying that troops in Iraq should be funded even if he disagreed with the overall war. (The measure passed 97 to zero.) In recent months, like other Democratic candidates, he has voted in favor of troop withdrawals and other measures to bring the war to a conclusion.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Rudy Giuliani']","
That's one way to slice the numbers. There are others.
","In early August, 2007, Rudy Giuliani announced he was making ""12 Commitments to the American People,"" including a pledge to ""increase adoptions, decrease abortions and protect the quality of life for our children.""
 
It's a point he has made before. During the May 3, 2007, Republican debate, he said this: ""When I was mayor of New York City, I encouraged adoptions. Adoptions went up 65-70 percent; abortions went down 16 percent.""
 
Indeed, abortions in Gotham declined 16.8 percent during Giuliani's eight-year tenure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 
But his claims about adoptions are far less clear-cut. The campaign didn't offer any research showing that rising adoption rates cause lower abortion rates, and we couldn't find any, either.
 
Two years into his first term, Giuliani created the Administration for Children's Services with a mission to improve the lives of the city's children. The agency aims to help kids in foster care, and it measures its success in large part by how many adoptions it facilitates each year. We focus on page 14 of the ACS 2003 Year End Review, which shows a bar chart of adoptions conducted through the city's child welfare system from 1989 to 2003.
 
Giuliani was mayor from Jan. 1, 1994, to Dec. 31, 2001. His new agency came on line in January 1996.
 
The chart shows a gradual increase in adoptions from 1989 through 1994, then a steeper increase through 1997 — the middle years of Giuliani's tenure. After that year, the numbers decline through 2002.
 
Giuliani arrives at his 65 to 70 percent increase by taking adoption rates for the six years before ACS was created and comparing them to the six years after.
 
That's one way to look at it, but it conceals some things. For instance, the chart shows that if you simply compare adoption rates in the first year of his tenure and in the last year, the rate increased by only 17 percent, a point made by our friends at FactCheck.org.
 
Averaging the rates over two six-year blocks helps smooth out peaks and valleys in individual years caused by social, economic and other forces, campaign aides said. The first two years after ACS came on line, there was a spike in adoptions that Giuliani's campaign said was because of a backlog of foster kids waiting to connect with families. Then, the numbers leveled off.
 
It's true, the aides say, the numbers go down significantly in Giuliani's final two years. But they're still higher than those of his predecessor, David Dinkins.
 
More recently, Giuliani has used a much more flattering number than the one he started with. His staff compared adoptions in all eight of his fiscal years against all eight of his predecessors'. This works out to a whopping 133 percent increase in adoptions.
 
So which number is it?
 
Something's wrong if voters have to ask.
 
When a statistic seems to go in so many directions, the best approach is an apples to apples one. For its abortion statistic, the Guiliani campaign looked at two points in time (the beginning and end of his tenure) and compared the two. Doing that for adoptions yields an increase of 17 percent.
 
So, he's got his numbers right on abortion rates, but he has inflated the adoption figures by getting too fancy with his math. We find his overall claim half-true.
 
UPDATE: We've corrected the launch date for the Administration for Children's Services. We mistakenly said 2006 when we should have said 1996.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Dennis Kucinich']","
Solid on Social Security
","In answering a debate question about the future of the Social Security system, U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich accurately described the lifespan of the popular program.
 
""You know, of course we ought to be raising the cap in order to protect Social Security, which is solid through about 2040 without any changes whatsoever,"" he said. U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton also referred to that date.
 
Indeed, the most recent report by Social Security actuaries concludes that 2041 is the year when the system would run out of money. To be sure, while the system is ""solid"" until then, that doesn't mean it doesn't need attention.
 
If no changes are made, as Kucinich says, the annual cost of paying out benefits will exceed the payroll tax money flowing in by 2017, according to the 2007 report from Social Security actuaries. From that point forward, benefit payments would come out of the Social Security trust fund. The year 2041 is when all those assets would be exhausted.
 
The cap Kucinich mentions is a limit on the amount of salary that is taxed for Social Security. Right now, that cap is at $97,500, but Kucinich said he supports raising it to tax more income.
 
In 2007, the program had 50-million beneficiaries and 163-million covered workers and their families.

Biden way off on alcohol-related birth defects
","Biden said he wouldn't consider changing the drinking age from 21 to 18 because of the negative effects of alcohol. As evidence, he said 300,000 babies suffer birth defects each year because their mothers are alcoholics.
 
Problem is, that number is way off. The National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome states that about 40,000 children are born each year suffering from Fetal Alchol Spectrum Disorders, which includes birth defects, but also conditions such as learning disabilities or poor motor skills. The group says that number is more than Spina Bifida, Down Syndrome and Muscular Dystrophy combined, but it's still quite a way from 300,000.
 
As for birth defects alone, the Surgeon General says that alcohol-related birth defects affect between .5 and 2 infants per 1,000 births. That comes to between about 2,100 and 8,300 cases a year, given current birth rates.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Bill Richardson']","
Not exactly, but close
","At the Democratic debate at Dartmouth College on Sept. 26, 2007, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson boasted about his state's economic growth. ""New Mexico (has) the sixth-fastest growing economy,"" he said.
 
He did not elaborate, so it's unclear whether he was referring to job growth or the state's gross domestic product.
 
In his speeches and TV ads, Richardson has often mentioned job growth as an indicator of a strong economy while he's been governor. In his TV ads, he's boasted that for job growth, the state ranked as high as sixth in the nation.
 
However, the latest employment report from the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions, which tracks job data, said the state ranked 14th for job growth in August 2007. The state hasn't ranked sixth since August 2006.
 
If economic strength is measured by the increase in state's gross domestic product, New Mexico actually ranks higher than sixth. Measured by the change from 2005 to 2006 (the most recent data available), the state ranks fifth, according to U.S. Commerce Department data.
 
So if Richardson was using this measurement of the economy, he slightly understated his state's growth.
 
Either way, Richardson is generally correct that the state's economy has done well in his term (largely because of gains in the oil and gas industry). We find his claim Mostly True.

Rudy Giuliani has been a world traveler since he ended his term as New York City mayor to become a security consultant. He says he's made 91 trips to 35 countries in the past five years.
 
On a whirlwind tour of the United Kingdom recently, he met with Prime Minister Gordon Brown and schmoozed Ronald Reagan's old friend Margaret Thatcher. In 2002, Queen Elizabeth II gave him an honorary knighthood for his leadership after the Sept. 11 attacks.
 
He must have been feeling particularly well-loved when he bragged to reporters in London that he was one of the ""four or five"" most famous Americans in the world.
 
Reporters were quick to ask: Who else is on the list?
 
""Bill Clinton … Hillary,"" Rudy began, before aides (wisely?) pulled him away.
 
He might want to add those two guys from his own party: George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
 
We know Giuliani is from New York, and if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. But still … top five? In the world?
 
We turned to the world of scientific polling. Polling the globe is a daunting proposition. But representatives of both the Gallup World Poll and the Pew Global Attitudes Project said they have never queried the world on who among us Americans is best known.
 
We asked Giuliani's campaign staff, but they didn't offer anything to back up the claim.
 
Opinionmakers across the Web guffawed at the notion that Giuliani ranks so high and were willing to offer other ideas. The New York

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Mitt Romney']","
A misleading account of NYC policy
","Romney is referring to a policy in New York and many other cities that directs municipal workers not to tell federal authorities about someone who might be an illegal immigrant unless the person is suspected of a crime or the federal government specifically requires such a report.
 
The policy, which began in 1989 under Mayor Ed Koch and was continued by Giuliani, is still in effect. It is based on the belief that undocumented immigrants are reluctant to report crimes, fires and seek medical care for fear of being deported. The idea is that they will be more likely to do so if they are reassured that city workers won't report them to the feds.
 
Immigration enforcement is primarily a federal obligation and local police haven't played much of a role, unless they have found that a suspected criminal is an illegal immigrant. And the local rules have no effect on federal authorities, who can still arrest and deport illegal immigrants.
 
But opponents of illegal immigration have dubbed municipalities with these policies as ""sanctuary cities,"" a term that conveys broader protection than the policies actually give. This is where Romney and Giuliani's attacks on each other are misleading.
 
Now Romney is correct that Giuliani was welcoming to immigrants and accurately quotes Giuliani's remarks from 1994. The comments come from a

New York Times

article that said Giuliani gave a ""spirited defense of illegal immigrants, virtually urging them to settle in New York City."" The article said he ""criticized the growing hostility toward illegal immigrants across the country as simplistic and unsophisticated.""
 
But Romney's claim that Giuliani ""made New York City what's known as a 'sanctuary city,' where illegal aliens were allowed to come"" suggests that the Big Apple was a unique safe haven where they would be free from deportation.
 
That's not true. Federal authorities could always enforce the law in New York.
 
And Romney's claim that Giuliani ""instructed the leaders of the city not to enforce the law, not to enforce immigration law"" is also misleading. City workers had no role in enforcing federal law. That's the feds' job.
 
So we rate Romney's attack on Giuliani as Half True because it exaggerates the real effect of New York City's policies and makes it seem like more of a ""sanctuary"" than it really was.

Richardson wants all troops out
","Bill Richardson claims for himself a place among the top tier candidates (Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards) as he seeks to distinguish himself from the field on Iraq, saying he is alone among this group to want to withdraw all the troops.
 
The distinction is real. The others candidate want to leave residual forces in Iraq to be on hand for peacekeeping purposes or in case terrorists mount an offensive. Richardson says a small force will be ineffective, and all troops should come home.
 
But we feel compelled to point out that Richardson's poll numbers have never put him in league with Clinton, Obama or Edwards. A Sept. 16 Gallup Poll showed him with 5 percent support, a good six points shy of Edwards' 11 percent, and well behind Clinton and Obama. That leaves Richardson in the single digits, along with Sen. Joe Biden and Rep. Dennis Kucinich.
 
Of those two rivals, Richardson's position is not significantly different from Kucinich on questions of withdrawal and timetables. Kucinich advocates a prompt withdrawal of U.S. troops to be replaced with international peace keepers. Biden, on the other hand, has proposed an elaborate plan for partitioning Iraq into self-governing regions with U.S. troops helping maintain order.
 
We won't take any points off for Richardson's claim to be among the ""major"" candidates here, but we will lower his Truth-O-Meter rating because the other candidates have not said they want troops in Iraq indefinitely, as Richardson suggests. Instead, they have said they need the information a commander-in-chief gets to make a final decision on force levels in Iraq. It may be a fine distinction, but it's not the same thing as supporting an indefinite deployment.

Define ""tax increase.""
","
This claim depends on your definition of a tax increase. As governor of Massachusetts, elected in 2002, Romney inherited a $3-billion state budget shortfall. And it's true that the budget problem was fixed without raising state income taxes. But Romney closed loopholes in the corporate income tax, which effectively increased taxes for some companies. And he and the legislature did increase a myriad of fees, on such things as boat registrations and court filings, which some might consider tax increases.
 
Also, state payments to cities and towns for schools and police were reduced, which caused those local governments to increase property taxes.
 
The Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee that pushes for spending cuts and tax cuts, evaluated Romney's fiscal record: ""Overall, Romney's record on tax policy is mixed. His record is marred by questionable statements and positions and his fee hikes and 'loophole' closures are troubling.""
 
We will note that the Club for Growth applauded Romney for supporting broad-based tax cuts.
 
We find his claim that he ""cut spending instead of raising taxes"" to be only half of the story about how he dealt with the state's financial crisis.

The Republican National Committee is correct that Sen. Barack Obama of Illinios, a top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, skipped a vote Thursday, Sept. 20, 2007, on a resolution meant to condemn the anti-war group MoveOn.org for an advertisement bashing Army Gen. David Petraues, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq.
 
The RNC release also correctly notes that Obama canceled a town hall meeting in Rock Hill, S.C., to stay in Washington for ""important votes on the future of America's presence in Iraq.""
 
It's not uncommon for members of Congress to miss votes because meetings can overlap with floor votes. But in this case, floor action on Iraq dominated the schedule, and Obama participated in the two Senate votes before and after the vote on the MoveOn resolution:
 
At 11:58 a.m., the Senate voted on an alternative resolution calling for support for the U.S. military. Obama voted yea. It passed.
 
At 12:35 p.m., the Senate voted on the MoveOn resolution. Obama did not vote. It passed.
 
At 2:54 p.m., the Senate voted on an amendment to a defense bill that sought to end most funding for the war in Iraq by June. Obama voted yea. It failed.
 
In a statement, Obama said he didn't vote on the resolution because it was a ""stunt.""
 
President Bush and his Republican allies in Congress have been fighting Democratic attempts to end the war in Iraq. They have seized on the MoveOn ad, published last week in the New York Times, in hopes of turning public sentiment against anti-war groups, and by extension their Democratic allies. The full-page ad said ""Gen. Petraeus or Gen. Betray Us?"" and questioned whether the general's report to Congress on progress in Iraq would be influenced by the White House.
 
MoveOn has leveraged its 3-million members to help drive opposition to the war, and in the process the group has become a powerful Democratic ally and fund-raiser.
 
Among other presidential hopefuls, Sens. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., and Chris Dodd, D-Conn., voted against the MoveOn resolution, while Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sam Brownback, R-Kan., voted for it. Another contender, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., also missed the vote, but he was absent from all votes Thursday.
 
The resolution was offered by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and it passed 72 to 25. Here's the text: ""To express the sense of the Senate that General David H. Petraeus, Commanding General, Multi-National Force-Iraq, deserves the full support of the Senate and strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus and all members of the United States Armed Forces.""
 
An alternative, offered by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., also passed, 50 to 47. All the Republicans opposed it, while all Democrats, including Obama, voted for it. Here's the text: ""To reaffirm strong support for all the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and to strongly condemn attacks on the honor, integrity, and patriotism of any individual who is serving or has served honorably in the United States Armed Forces, by any person or organization.""

Trump calls Colorado caucus system 'rigged,' but there's no proof rules favor anyone
","After Ted Cruz completed his sweep of all 34 delegates at the Colorado Republican convention, Donald Trump branded the state GOP’s caucus system ""rigged"" and ""crooked."" Trump told Fox & Friends that rank-and-file Colorado Republicans are ""going absolutely crazy because they weren't given a vote, this was given by politicians. It's a crooked deal. ... It's a rigged system."" Trump implied that he didn’t bother speaking to the Colorado convention because state ""politicians"" controlled the process and there’s ""no voting."" Fox News contributor Pete Hegseth asked Trump, ""Isn't it just fair to say, These are the rules, Ted Cruz is organized, and you're just flat-out being out-organized?"" Trump disagreed, saying, he has ""out-organized"" Cruz because ""I have millions of more votes"" and more delegates. Like many state caucuses, Colorado’s is a complex and arcane maze for newcomers to navigate.   But was the Colorado system ""rigged"" and a ""crooked deal"" that deprived people of their vote, as Trump claimed? Confusing as they are, the rules for the caucus were changed in August 2015, two months after Trump entered the presidential race. And there’s no evidence the tweaks were made to disenfranchise Trump. Let’s dig deeper. Trump has performed better in states with primary elections, where his supporters can simply vote at their regular neighborhood polling place. But the Republican frontrunner’s campaign has struggled in state caucuses because it has lacked a strong ground game to shepherd voters through bewildering caucus gatherings that are rife with rules. When Trump said there was ""no voting"" at the Colorado caucuses, he was referring to an August 2015 decision by the state GOP's executive committee, which unanimously voted to abandon a presidential preference poll at this year’s precinct caucuses. The committee said it was reacting to the national party changing its rules to bind state delegates to the caucus winner — potentially leaving delegates tied to a candidate who later dropped out of the race. Yet, Trump is wrong in saying there was ""no voting"" at the caucuses. About 60,000 Republicans attended the state precinct caucuses. People voted at every level of the delegate selection process. The multistep Colorado GOP caucus process began March 1, when party members selected delegates at precinct caucuses. Those delegates moved on to higher-level gatherings before delegates for the Republican National Convention were selected at district assemblies and the April 9 state convention. Cruz, whose campaign had been building an organization in Colorado since January, was the only GOP presidential candidate to address the state convention. He grabbed all 34 delegates. Trump supporters, however, describe a problem-plagued process at the state convention. At a protest outside the Colorado Capitol building on Friday, April 15, about 200 Trump backers said their votes were ""stolen."" Some claimed they were misinformed and even lied to during the caucuses. The confusion continued at the state convention. Party organizers left about 30 delegates off the ballot and had to send out a correction sheet just before the convention vote. At least one Cruz delegate was entered twice on the ballot, replacing a Trump delegate, said Gabriel Schwartz, a Trump backer and state convention veteran. ""Very obvious there was gross incompetence at the state (GOP) level,"" Schwartz told KMGH-TV. State GOP officials called the snafus a few ""clerical errors"" that didn’t impact the convention’s outcome. A Denver Post editorial said the Colorado Republican Party’s process for selecting presidential delegates ""ranked among the least representative of all states."" The editorial based its finding on the caucuses’ delegate-to-voter ratio — roughly 1 to 1,714 — and a national analysis by FiveThirtyEight.com. ""In short, Colorado Republican leaders got what they wanted when they abandoned a presidential preference poll at the caucus. An extremely narrow base of activists and insiders chose the delegates in a process that ranked among the least representative and democratic in the country,"" the editorial said. However, the editorial still concluded, ""Not that Donald Trump and his supporters have any ground for their complaints. As we've said before, they knew the rules."" Even some Trump backers were disappointed by the campaign’s weak effort in Colorado. Trump delegate Larry Lindsey posted a YouTube that went viral of him fuming about being denied entrance to the state convention and burning his Republican party registration paper. Lindsey said he later learned that he was ineligible for the convention because he’d missed a county caucus vote. Yet, he said, someone told him the meeting was postponed. ""The (Trump) organization here in Colorado was definitely lacking. I have to admit that, reluctantly,"" Lindsey told PolitiFact. University of Denver political scientist Peter Hanson said Cruz’s win in Colorado is a reminder that a good ground game matters. ""Organization is key,"" Hanson told KMGH-TV. ""It's one thing for a candidate to give a speech to a rally and think that their work is done. That's just not the way it works."" U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio, issued a sharp rebuttal to Trump’s criticism of the state caucus system. ""Donald Trump, who has known the rules since last August, he decided not to show up. Elections are won by those who show up and Ted Cruz showed up,"" Gardner told Fox News. Our ruling  Trump said the Colorado GOP’s caucus system is ""rigged"" and ""crooked."" There are plenty of problems with Colorado’s caucus system. The delegate selection process is dominated by party activists and insiders, and this year’s caucuses were hampered -- at best -- by confusion and technical glitches. But Trump is complaining about rules that were in place eight months ago, when the Republican presidential race was clogged with 17 candidates. There is no evidence the rules were designed to favor a specific candidate. His campaign took a pass on the Colorado caucuses, focusing instead on the delegate-rich New York primary, while Cruz ran an exhaustive ground game in the Centennial State. We rate his claim False.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/10e606f7-fc56-4d69-9c82-562b82fdb45b",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC79B40>],/factchecks/2016/apr/19/donald-trump/trump-calls-colorado-caucus-system-rigged-theres-n/

Donald Trump manager Corey Lewandowski botches claim on Florida delegate selection
","Donald Trump’s campaign has been crying foul over the delegate selection in Florida, accusing Republican party insiders of stacking the deck against Trump. In Miami-Dade County, home of former presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, few of the 15 delegates chosen April 16 appeared to be overt Trump fans. The next day, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski accused Blaise Ingoglia, chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, of bias against Trump. ""The chairman of the party of Florida, who is an avid and outward supporter of Marco Rubio, gets to appoint 30 of those delegates,"" Lewandowski said April 17. ""Now, I understand those are the rules, but Donald Trump won. And now, you’ve got a person who is supporting Marco Rubio who gets to appoint 30 of the 99 delegates. That’s not what the rules should be."" We will explain how Lewandowski got his facts wrong about the delegate selection and Ingoglia. We did not get a response from the Trump campaign for this fact-check. Florida’s process for choosing GOP delegates Ingoglia doesn’t get to appoint delegates, but he does get to recommend some -- although it’s half of the number cited by Lewandowski. The bulk of the 99 delegates are chosen by local GOP leaders and state committeemen and women in the congressional districts, adding up to 81 delegates. Additionally, there are three at-large delegates who are automatic: Ingoglia, National Committeewoman Sharon Day and National Committeeman Peter Feaman. Then as party chairman, Ingoglia recommends the final 15 delegates to the state party’s executive board. The 35-member board, which includes Ingoglia, will vote on those delegates at its meeting in Tampa on May 14. ""This has been the process for over a decade,"" state party spokesman Wadi Gaitan told PolitiFact Florida. Ingoglia is reviewing applications and hasn’t announced who he will recommend. Ties between Ingoglia and Rubio Lewandowski is wrong that Ingoglia supported Rubio in the presidential race. He hasn’t endorsed anyone.   While there is evidence that Ingoglia and Rubio have supported each other in the past, it was before Rubio’s campaign for president and Ingoglia’s role as state party chair. ""At no point did he fund-raise or do any kind of favor for one candidate over another,"" Gaitan said. ""We have no idea what Mr. Lewandowski is talking about. The state party and our chairman have been consistently clear that we have and will continue to remain neutral during this process."" Ingoglia stayed out of the presidential primary and avoided bashing Trump. For example, when several politicians weighed in on Trump’s proposal to ban Muslims, Ingoglia declined to respond when asked by a Tampa Bay Times reporter. Ingoglia gave money to Rubio’s first U.S. Senate race and then his Senate campaign account, but it was a tiny amount of Rubio’s haul. And it’s not not unusual for a Republican activist such as Ingoglia to give to a statewide candidate. On April 6, 2009, Ingoglia donated $250 to Rubio’s U.S. Senate race. Later that month Ingoglia became the Hernando County GOP chair.   On Sept. 30, 2013, Ingoglia gave $1,000 to the Rubio Victory Committee, a Senate account. At that point, Rubio was in his first full year in the Senate and wasn’t running for president yet. In 2014, Rubio endorsed Ingoglia’s state House bid which he won. Ingoglia was elected by party activists as state chair in January 2015. Rubio announced his presidential race in April 2015. So Ingoglia supported Rubio when he was a Senate candidate and senator and Rubio backed Ingoglia’s state House race. But that doesn’t prove Ingoglia was an ""avid"" supporter of Rubio’s presidential race. After Trump swept the Florida primary, we found a couple of examples of Ingoglia making nice with Trump, but he still doesn’t endorse him. In an interview on CNN on primary night, Ingoglia gave credit to Trump for GOP turnout. ""And we had record, historic turnout here in the state of Florida. ... ,"" Ingoglia said. ""The first thing I would say is that Donald Trump is definitely activating a lot of voters that have been dormant and sitting on the sidelines for at least the last two presidential elections."" Days later, Ingoglia had a photo taken of himself with Trump and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi at the Palm Beach Lincoln Day dinner where Trump gave the keynote speech.   ""Typical Sunday night ... having dinner with a couple of friends,"" Ingoglia posted on Instagram. But there is another state GOP leader who has lambasted Trump. Tampa Bay Times political editor Adam C. Smith wrote that, ""the real leader of the state GOP is incoming Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran."" The Florida House is the most importance source of funds for the party because Gov. Rick Scott and the state Senate pulled their finance operations out of the state party. Corcoran has bashed Trump: ""What birthed the phenomenon of a candidate who in all definition of the word is running a quasi-repugnant campaign that is baseless? You have a candidate who has flip-flopped on every issue,'' Corcoran said in a speech to the Florida Chamber in January. Our ruling Lewandowski is wrong on multiple fronts for his statement that ""the chairman of the party of Florida, who is an avid and outward supporter of Marco Rubio, gets to appoint 30 of those (99) delegates."" State party chairman Blaise Ingoglia doesn’t get to appoint delegates. However, he gets to recommend 15 delegates to the state party’s executive board, which then takes a vote. So Lewandowski doubled the number and exaggerated Ingoglia’s power. Most of the 99 delegates are chosen by party leaders in congressional districts. Also, Lewandowski has no proof that Ingoglia is an ""avid and outward supporter"" of Rubio’s presidential bid. Ingoglia donated $1,250 to Rubio when he was a Senate candidate or a senator, but that was years before he ran for president.

Ohio Democratic Party bashes John Kasich's 'costly campaign'
","In recent weeks, the national media has poked fun at John Kasich for chomping through Italian subs and pasta in the Bronx and eating pizza in Queens — with a knife and fork. Back home, Ohio Democrats talked about something else: the governor’s out-of-state travel, and what it costs taxpayers in the only state he has won.   The Ohio Democratic Party posted a graphic on its Facebook page on April 8, 2016, to bolster its complaint. Kasich’s ""costly campaign,"" the image says, entails 177 days spent out of state and a tab of $350,000 to taxpayers. How did they calculate the days and dollars? We decided to look into it. The party’s communications director, Kirstin Alvanitakis, pointed us to a March 26 Columbus Dispatch story reporting that Kasich has been out of state at least 177 days as he pursued the presidency. The Dispatch tally includes days he spent exploring the bid before his official announcement July 21, 2015. An Associated Press story contains the $350,000 figure. By law, a special unit within the state department of public safety is assigned to protect the governor, and nine state troopers guard him 24/7. So when he goes to Mike’s Deli, so do they. State funds from the public safety department’s non-highway program, which includes the governor’s security detail, is likely paying for rental cars, hotel rooms, flights, fuel, per diems and overtime while Kasich criss-crosses the country chasing delegates. But the Dispatch story describes how cagey state agencies are being with these specifics. Information that was public in the years before Kasich’s run is now shielded. On payroll records, the governor’s detail was previously listed as the ""executive protection unit."" Officials told the Dispatch that that designation that has been dropped to shield the troopers’ identities. ""To ensure safety and security, we do not discuss any of the resources used as part of the executive security detail,"" is the response repeated by agency spokespersons and the governor’s campaign staff alike. The Associated Press used another tool to approximate the cost: an interactive, searchable ""checkbook"" of state spending hosted on the website of Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, part of his nationally recognized transparency initiative. We used the Ohio Checkbook to drill down into the data, which has been updated since the AP checked. Isolating the travel costs of the non-highway program, which is currently showing expenditures from July 1, 2015, through Feb. 2, 2016, the total now comes to $403,638.  This chart shows how disproportionate the travel spending has been in 2016 so far, compared to prior years.  Most of the transactions shown through the Ohio Checkbook lack details (""General Travel Expenses"" is a recurring line item), but there are some expenditures that coincide with Kasich’s campaign stops. Like a batch of hotel rooms booked over a series of days in December at the Wynn Las Vegas, the Renaissance Des Moines, the Doubletree Salt Lake City, and the Hampton Inn of Waterloo, all around the time period last December when Kasich bounced from a debate in Nevada, to a town hall in Iowa, to a fundraiser in Utah, and back to Iowa. It’s not a staggering total, though some taxpayers might argue that $403,638 could be better spent on other state services. Kasich has poo-pooed any suggestions that he should drop out of the race before the Republican National Convention in July, which means the total taxpayer share from his campaign travel could continue to swell. (The average monthly spending from this fund in fiscal year 2016 is about $57,663. By comparison, $57,562 was the total spent in all of fiscal year 2014.) Other governors who ran for president have stuck taxpayers with tabs, too. Chris Christie’s security detail cost New Jersey taxpayers an estimated $614,000. Bobby Jindal racked up $400,000 in Louisiana during his considerably shorter run through November 2015. Wisconsin taxpayers paid Scott Walker’s security team $577,000 in overtime alone before he dropped out in September 2015. Walker reimbursed about $260,000 to the state for expenses his campaign incurred. So far, the Kasich campaign has refused to disclose details about his security detail or its resources, or whether he similarly intends to give taxpayers a refund. We did not hear a response from Kasich’s campaign, or spokesman Rob Nichols. Our ruling The Ohio Democratic Party said that in 177 days on the campaign trail, Kasich’s security detail cost taxpayers $350,000. Our analysis confirmed that $350,000 is most likely a conservative estimate. At the current rate, the total could be twice that by the RNC in July. Since neither state officials nor Kasich’s camp will confirm any details on the governor’s security, we have to rely on what we learned from the treasurer’s open records data.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Military', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Sanders oversimplifies U.S. share of NATO
","In most respects, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are light years apart, but on some policy points, they seem to be on the same page. One area of common ground is U.S. funding for NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Trump has raised the specter of America pulling out of the military alliance if the Europeans don’t pick up a bigger share. At the Democratic debate in Brooklyn, N.Y. on April 14, 2016, Sanders didn’t go quite that far, but he certainly talked about the problem in similar terms. A panelist quoted Sanders’ own words on NATO from 1997. Back then he said, ""It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe."" Asked if he still felt that way during the debate, Sanders said, ""We spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO. Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense."" Does the United States pay as large a share of NATO military spending as Sanders said? When we originally heard this item, we thought Sanders had it right. We originally published this fact-check moments after the April 14 debate as True. But very quickly, we discovered that Sanders didn’t describe the 75 percent statistic entirely accurately. We removed that fact-check from our database and are taking a fresh look here. Warren Gunnels, policy director for the Sanders campaign, referred us to a Wall Street Journal article about how few NATO members meet the alliance’s defense spending targets. On paper, members say they will put at least 2 percent of their GDP into their militaries. In practice, only five do: the United States, the United Kingdom, Greece, Estonia and Poland. ""Sen. Sanders made the point that our NATO allies should pick up more of the burden for their defense, citing the fact that the United States spends about 75 percent of NATO's total military expenditures,"" Gunnels said. We went to the latest NATO budget report. By NATO’s count, total defense spending of all NATO members stood at about $900 billion in 2015 in current dollars. The United States’ share was about $650 billion. Do the math, and the percentage comes to about 72 percent. Here are the top four top countries on NATO’s list: Country Spending (millions) Percent of total United States $649,931 72.2% United Kingdom $59,699 6.6% France $43,864 4.9% Germany $39,743 4.4% NATO total $900,473   But we need to understand what these numbers show. They don’t represent dollars or euros spent on behalf of NATO, or as Sanders said, ""the military aspect of NATO."" These figures are the total defense budgets of the NATO members -- including spending on projects far from NATO’s purview. Gordon Adams, professor emeritus at American University’s School of International Service, told us this is the standard approach to the question of which country brings the most to the NATO party. ""The comparison folks look at is overall defense spending, and by the NATO definition, the United States covers more than 70 percent of the total for all NATO members,"" Adams said. Adams argues that the United States pays for a global operation, part of which includes Europe. The European members mainly pay for European-based forces for use in Europe. America’s equipment and personnel, Adams notes, can be used anywhere. ""Were there a war in Europe, U.S. defense capabilities elsewhere in the world would be swung to Europe,"" he said. So even if America has sent ships to the South China Sea to discourage China’s activities there, and is bombing ISIS in Iraq and Syria, all that and more weighs in the balance of NATO’s resources. That is one view. Laicie Heeley, a military budget expert at the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank, sees things otherwise. ""Sanders' claim is a commonly quoted misperception, or misleading quote, however you choose to see it,"" Heeley said. ""The stat says nothing about the U.S. relationship to NATO. It simply states that the United States is the world's greatest military spender."" Lisa Samp, a fellow with the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, also describes Sanders’ words as a ""common misunderstanding."" ""There is a difference between what nations contribute to NATO and what they spend on their own defense,"" Samp said. ""More accurate would be to say the United States contributes 22 percent of NATO’s common funding."" NATO’s common expenses NATO does have things it calls its own. There is a civilian staff and headquarters, and military equipment such as surveillance aircraft. There are bases, command headquarters and a program to beef up military capabilities in certain countries above and beyond what they would need for their own defense. For 2016, NATO’s total military budget is about $2 billion. (Since Sanders specified the military aspect, we’ll ignore the civilian costs, which are about $200 million.) Each member contributes an agreed upon percentage of the shared budget. The United States leads the pack, paying 22 percent, as Samp said. This year, that comes to about $460 million. (Germany comes in second, paying about 15 percent.) That is a far cry from 75 percent of NATO’s military expense. But while the common expenses allow us to be more precise about the money American taxpayers put into NATO, these numbers don’t capture either the full picture of the U.S. presence in Europe, or NATO’s true military capacity. ""You could not fight a war with the $2 billion,"" Adams said. ""I have to say defining (the NATO budget) that way is, to me, both irrelevant and meaningless."" Interwoven goals, interwoven dollars The one point that experts seem to agree on is that there is no easy way to separate America’s military spending in Europe from its global military strategy. The United States has responded to Russia’s military moves in Ukraine with a program to boost the U.S. presence in central and eastern Europe. With a 2016 price tag just shy of $800 million, the Pentagon has put more boots on the ground, prepositioned equipment and supplies and in many other ways laid the groundwork to respond faster to any new moves Russia might make. Samp told us while this clearly helps defend Europe, it has greater implications. ""It’s not just for Europe but to forward deploy and have global reach,"" she said. ""We can’t say everything we’re doing in Europe is just for Europe. It’s for our benefit and our overall strategy as well."" In the same way that American forces around the world could be called in to help Europe, so too are American forces in Europe available to support U.S. operations elsewhere, for example in fighting ISIS in the Middle East. ""There is no easy way to sort out what the United States spends by region because both equipment and personnel are usable in every region of the world,"" Adams said.   Our ruling Sanders said that the United States spends ""about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO."" The problem with that statement is that NATO’s military resources defy easy description. There are two ways to quantify them and both are incomplete. The alliance sums up the total defense budgets of its members and counts that as its resources. By that measure, the United States represents about 72 percent of NATO. But that hardly captures America’s role because its defense budget is shaped by factors outside of Europe. On the other hand, NATO has common military expenses on the order of $2 billion a year. The U.S. share of that is about 22 percent. But those dollars exclude the vast spending it takes to sustain American forces, equipment and bases across Europe. And in a final twist, even those expenditures aren’t solely for the benefit of Europe. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EA9C3D80>],/factchecks/2016/apr/19/bernie-sanders/sanders-oversimplifies-us-share-NATO/
"['Arizona', 'Fires', 'Doug Ducey']","
Are 90 percent of fires in Arizona caused by humans?
","As officials gear up for wildfire season in Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey talked fire safety at a press conference April 13. ""I think it’s important to note that 90 percent of fires in Arizona are human-caused,"" Ducey said. ""Unattended campfires, discarded cigarettes, hot exhaust pipes, any source of extreme heat or spark can result in a Wallow or Rodeo-Chediski fire."" Given Arizona’s vast land area, 113,594.08 square miles to be exact, we were curious as to whether nine out of every 10 fires in the state really are caused by humans and how that could be documented. Sort of  Ducey’s spokesman, Daniel Scarpinato, provided us with Arizona State Forestry data that backs up the governor’s claim on the surface. In 2015, 352 out of 404 fires, more than 87 percent, were human-caused. Of the 304 fires reported this year, 296, more than 97 percent, were human-caused. The State Forestry maintains a database of all fires, even if they don’t respond to a blaze at first. State Forestry spokesman Bill Boyd said most fires historically are human-caused, even something as simple as parking a hot car over grass. ""If you look at it over the years, there is a large human component in there,"" Boyd said. But there’s a caveat here -- the data only includes fires on state and private land, not federal land. Ducey said ""in Arizona,"" which also includes federally-managed land. Almost 40 percent of the Grand Canyon State is federal land. Multiple agencies, including the U.S. Agriculture Department, U.S. Defense Department and U.S. Interior Department, have fire jurisdiction over certain areas of land. For example, the U.S. Forest Service has fire jurisdiction over national forests and the Bureau of Indian Affairs does the same for tribal land. ""It is complex and coordinated at all levels, from local to national,"" said Mary Zabinski, spokeswoman for the Southwest Coordination Center, an interagency group of state and federal agencies. All that coordination means we do have a total for the entire state for human-caused fires. According to the Southwest Coordination Center, for the entire state of Arizona -- state, private and federal land -- 61 percent of fires in 2015 were caused by humans, and 39 percent of fires were caused by lightning. However, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Jennifer Jones notes that 90 percent of wildfires on all land nationwide are caused by humans. ""Typically, the majority of fires on land under the jurisdiction of state and local government agencies are human caused as those lands are closer to homes and roads,"" Jones said. Our ruling Ducey said that ""90 percent of fires in Arizona are human-caused."" Ducey’s claim is correct when referencing only state and private land. But he wasn’t that specific. Fires ""in Arizona"" includes federally-managed land, in addition to state and private land. And the percentage of human-caused fires on all those lands combined isn’t 90 percent, it’s 61 percent.   So Ducey has a point that human activity is contributing to wildfires, but the number he cites is a good bit off. On balance, we rate Ducey’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/525a6335-26e4-476f-8213-ceac74e77b7c",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAAAAC0>],/factchecks/2016/apr/19/doug-ducey/are-90-percent-fires-arizona-caused-humans/
"['Global News Service', 'Legal Issues', 'Taxes', 'ActionAid UK']","
Do tax dodgers really cost developing countries $200 billion? Maybe
","The massive leak of financial and legal files known collectively as the Panama Papers has fueled demands for new rules to govern international taxation. While we still don’t know how many of the secretive deals actually broke any laws, ActionAid UK, an anti-poverty advocacy group, argued that these maneuvers starve struggling nations of much needed tax revenues. It asked the public to demand action from British lawmakers. ""Tax dodging costs developing countries $200 billion every year,"" it posted on its website. We were curious where ActionAid got that number. The source was a 2015 report written by three researchers at the International Monetary Fund. Titled ""Base Erosion, Profit Shifting and Developing Countries,"" it used data from 120 countries to estimate the impact of lost revenues due to a couple of factors. One driver was companies shifting profits to avoid taxes. If a multinational corporation creates a paper trail that leaves more profits in a low-tax rate country, it trims its overall tax bill.The authors noted that aggressive tax strategies involving tax haven nations have grown over the past two decades. The other factor was competition among nations. That happens when Country A lowers its corporate tax rate because it saw Country B do the same. You can see this dynamic as setting up the conditions that make profit shifting more likely. If you invest in a multinational corporation, the trends on tax rates work in your favor. If you are in a country that needs tax revenues, your view might be different. The report assessed three kinds of countries: members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, non-OECD members, and tax haven nations. In general, OECD members are advanced industrialized economies. This chart from the report shows how tax rates have fallen over the years. Corporate Income Tax Rates, 1980–2013  When companies pay less taxes because nations aim to attract investment by reducing their corporate tax rates, that isn’t precisely tax dodging. But the IMF team was able to tease out the impact of aggressive tax avoidance by itself. They came up with two estimates, short and long run. The first captures the hit on tax revenues at some hypothetical point when a country changes its tax rates. The immediate loss would be in the neighborhood of $28 billion across the non-OECD group. But over a span of several years, researchers say corporations adapt and work the angles more. They start setting up subsidiaries in certain places not because it makes sense for reasons of production, distribution or sales, but simply because it’s a way to funnel profits into a lower tax jurisdiction. Over time, the total tax loss balloons to $200 billion each year, in line with the number ActionAid UK cited. Vetting the IMF study We asked a number of international tax experts what they thought about the IMF estimate. To be sure, the IMF authors themselves called their approach ""highly speculative"" and presented their long-run estimate as the midpoint between a low of about $100 billion and a high of $300 billion. Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College, has written extensively on how companies shift profits to cut their tax obligations. ""I think that IMF study is about as good as we are going to get,"" Clausing said. ""They are using the best data we have available and pretty careful methods. I've read their paper quite carefully."" Dhammika Dharmapala, a law professor at the University of Chicago, called the report ""a helpful step forward,"" but added, ""I don’t know of an estimate of the tax revenue losses from base erosion and profit shifting for developing countries that has achieved wide consensus in the scholarly community."" Nadine Riedel, an economist in public finance at  Ruhr University-Bochum in Germany, said the IMF work was a valuable addition to the research, but she emphasized that the words of caution from the authors ""should be taken very seriously by the reader."" ""There is considerable uncertainty related to the revenue loss estimate the authors present, which they make very clear themselves,"" Riedel told PolitiFact. In particular, Riedel noted that the IMF economists used a high-end estimate to calculate how quickly corporations would move to exploit lower tax rates. (The technical term is elasticity.) The combination of the cautionary words from the IMF researchers themselves and the weight of opinion from outside experts puts the $200 billion estimate on shaky ground. Analytically, it is a tenuous figure. But there’s another wrinkle. Many of the countries ActionAid focuses on, the poorer nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America, are lumped in with much more affluent nations in the IMF analysis. Defining a developing country The IMF study had data on 74 non-OECD nations. That group included many low-income countries, such as Malawi, Cambodia and Uganda. But it also included those that the World Bank considers just one step below high-income, such as China, Mexico and Brazil. The IMF report called all of them developing countries, and with some justification. For the most part, that is the category the United Nations applies to them. Still, it is important to note that some very large economies, such as those of China and India, would account for many of the dollars in that $200 billion estimate. Alex Cobham is a board member of ActionAid UK and director of research at a related advocacy group, the Tax Justice Network. Cobham agreed that a country like Brazil is not in the same boat as one like Malawi. But Cobham said the IMF results suggest that the impact of tax avoidance is even greater for a place like Malawi. ""In low income countries, the GDP is low, but so are their tax revenues,"" Cobham said. ""If you take Malawi, it starts with such a low tax base, that even if it loses money at the same rate as all the others based on its GDP, the relative hit on revenues is probably even harder to absorb."" The IMF report supports that point. It notes that the ratio of tax revenue to GDP in low income countries is around 15 percent, compared to about 35 percent in the OECD. Our ruling ActionAid UK said ""tax dodging costs developing countries $200 billion every year."" Even the IMF report that provided the figure called the estimate ""highly speculative."" For the most part, the outside experts we reached were even more cautious. ActionAid didn’t reflect any of that uncertainty. In addition, the total includes taxes lost by countries that are doing much better than low income nations. The statement is partially correct but the core figure comes with many caveats. We rate this claim Half True. Update, April 20, 2016: After we published, Charlie Matthews who spearheads ActionAid UK's global tax advocacy work sent us this note: ""We use 'estimated' in reports etc, but it seems that's been lost as report text is turned into website copy.

","On the eve of the New York Democratic primary -- where he needs a strong showing to have any hope of winning the presidential nomination contest -- Bernie Sanders has repeatedly emphasized the importance of a large turnout. In an April 12 speech in Syracuse, Sanders told supporters, ""A week from today there's going to be an enormously important Democratic primary in New York state. What we have found is we win when voter turnout is high, we lose when it is low. Next Tuesday, let us come out in large numbers. Let us have the highest voter turnout in Democratic primary history in New York."" We wondered whether it’s accurate for Sanders to say he’s won when turnout is high and lost when the turnout is low. We didn’t find a unified source that presents 2016 Democratic primary turnout rates on a state-by-state basis, so we created measurements that address two different ways of measuring turnout. (Political scientists we contacted said our approach was solid.) The bottom line is that we found a few cases where Sanders won high turnout states, but overall, the case he makes is pretty thin. Turnout rates in the 2016 primaries and caucuses Let's start with the first way of measuring turnout: How many people voted in the 2016 primaries and caucuses compared with 2012. To do this, we divided by the number of Democratic ballots cast in the 2016 primaries and caucuses by the number of votes Barack Obama received in the 2012 general election (a reasonable approximation of how many Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters there are in each state). The higher this percentage, the higher the turnout. (We used data from the U.S. Elections Project, run by University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald, and NBC News.) As the following chart shows, Sanders won the three highest-turnout contests, but also the 10 lowest-turnout contests. States won by Sanders are marked in bold. State Primary/caucus Winner Democratic ballots / Obama 2012 votes Oklahoma Primary Sanders 75.87% New Hampshire Primary Sanders 69.13% Vermont Primary Sanders 67.88% Illinois Primary Clinton 66.82% Massachusetts Primary Clinton 64.18% Wisconsin Primary Sanders 62.08% Arkansas Primary Clinton 56.33% North Carolina Primary Clinton 52.47% Missouri Primary Clinton 51.53% Alabama Primary Clinton 50.01% Michigan Primary Sanders 47.06% Ohio Primary Clinton 44.29% South Carolina Primary Clinton 44.11% Arizona Primary Clinton 43.95% Texas Primary Clinton 43.59% Georgia Primary Clinton 43.44% Mississippi Primary Clinton 41.75% Virginia Primary Clinton 41.20% Florida Primary Clinton 40.36% Tennessee Primary Clinton 38.96% Louisiana Primary Clinton 38.56% Utah Caucus Sanders 33.71% Iowa Caucus Clinton 20.96% Nevada Caucus Clinton 15.88% Washington state Caucus Sanders 14.19% Minnesota Caucus Sanders 13.89% Nebraska Caucus Sanders 11.57% Maine Caucus Sanders 11.56% Idaho Caucus Sanders 11.24% Hawaii Caucus Sanders 11.12% Colorado Caucus Sanders 10.97% Alaska Caucus Sanders 10.38% Wyoming Caucus Sanders 10.18% Kansas Caucus Sanders 9.35% So Sanders does have something of a point -- the top three slots are all states he won. Vermont is an outlier -- it’s Sanders’ home state -- but Oklahoma and New Hampshire are legitimate, high-turnout Sanders victories. Sanders won two other primary states with relatively high turnouts -- Michigan and Wisconsin. Hillary Clinton took the rest. But Sanders' point holds as long as you only consider primaries and ignore caucuses. Remember those bottom 10 states that Sanders won? They were all caucuses, where the complicated process tends to keep voter turnout low. Ignoring the large number of low-turnout caucuses Sanders won would be cherry-picking. Putting these low-turnout caucuses into the calculation quickly weakens the link between high-turnout contests and Sanders victories: The average turnout rate for a state won by Clinton was 44 percent, while the average state won by Sanders had a turnout rate of 31 percent. Turnout change between 2008 and 2016 There's another way to define a high-turnout primary or caucus -- to see how much turnout grew in 2016 compared with the last contested Democratic primary year, 2008. To do this, we compared the number of Democratic ballots cast in 2008 to the number cast in 2016, once again using U.S. Elections Project data. The chart below shows how primary turnout grew (the positive values) or shrunk (the negative values) between 2008 and 2016. Once again, Sanders’ states are in bold: State Democratic turnout increase, 2008 to 2016 Michigan + 102.82% Alaska + 22.96% Idaho + 12.53% Kansas + 7.85% Maine + 2.98% Colorado + 2.92% Minnesota + 0.44% Florida - 2.33% Massachusetts - 3.44% Illinois - 4.40% Wisconsin - 10.04% Arizona - 10.43% New Hampshire - 11.74% Vermont - 12.89% Nebraska - 13.47% Louisiana - 18.88% Oklahoma - 19.50% Wyoming - 20.03% Virginia - 20.40% Missouri - 24.12% Alabama - 26.05% Iowa - 27.50% North Carolina - 27.69% Georgia - 27.85% Nevada - 28.55% South Carolina - 29.90% Arkansas - 30.02% Tennessee - 40.57% Utah - 41.14% Mississippi - 49.19% Ohio - 49.27% Texas - 50.06% Washington state - 66.73% So, with this measurement too, states that Sanders won are clustered near the top of the list -- but once again, there are some important caveats. For starters, the only primary state Sanders won that saw turnout growth this year was a real outlier, Michigan. Due to an intra-party dispute in 2008, Obama wasn’t on the ballot in Michigan eight years ago. As a result, it’s no surprise to see turnout more than double in 2016. And we’ll discount Minnesota, since its caucus participation figure for 2016 is an estimate, and was virtually the same numerically as 2008. That leaves five states won by Sanders where turnout increased. But it’s worth keeping in mind that each was a caucus state, and the increases in turnout were extraordinarily small in the context of a primary season where millions of votes have been cast. Alaska was up 1,979, Idaho was up 2,660, Kansas was up 2,911, Maine was up 1,330, and Colorado was up 3,507. In most states -- including most of those won by Sanders such as New Hampshire and Wisconsin -- turnout has actually fallen compared with the 2008 primaries, when Obama was running to become the first African-American president. With Democratic turnout down almost everywhere compared with 2008, it’s a stretch for Sanders to tout his ability to win by drawing waves of additional voters to the polls. In fact, Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist, not only agreed with our conclusions but also also volunteered to run the math on how Sanders’ share of the vote has been influenced by three factors -- the percentage of African-American voters, whether the state was in the northern or southern United States, and turnout. He found that race and region were powerful predictors of how well Sanders did -- and that turnout mattered very little. Our ruling Sanders said, ""We win when voter turnout is high, we lose when it is low."" Sanders did notch a few notable victories in high-turnout primaries, but it would be cherry-picking to focus only on primaries. Sanders has mostly won caucuses, which have produced the lowest turnout rates of 2016 across the board. And while Sanders did win the handful of states where Democratic turnout increased over 2008, these increases were tiny, casting doubt on how significant an accomplishment this is. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/074dfd44-4244-447d-8cd3-371fb14bad33",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBCA3C0>],/factchecks/2016/apr/19/bernie-sanders/sanders-largely-base-saying-we-win-when-voter-turn/

Jack Berry in error about Richmond teacher raises
","Jack Berry, one of a dozen candidates seeking to become Richmond’s next mayor, says the city has been neglecting its schools and educators. ""There’s no excuse for buildings falling apart and teachers not getting a raise for almost 10 years,"" he said at an April 6 candidates forum organized by former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who was Richmond’s mayor from 2005 to 2009. We wondered if Berry was correct that the city’s teachers went a decade without a pay hike. Berry, the outgoing director of Venture Richmond, told us he based his statement on several articles about teacher pay in RVANews and Richmond Magazine. The articles note that teachers used to get milestone raises based on the number of years they worked in the school system. But it’s been 10 years since the Richmond School Board provided teachers a salary bump based on tenure, according to a chart sent to us by Charlotte Hayer, president of the Richmond Education Association, which represents many of the city’s teachers. During the Great Recession from December 2007 to June 2009, that salary scale was frozen.   ""We haven’t moved (on the pay scale),"" Hayer said. ""We haven’t gained anything for our experience."" That doesn’t mean there have been no raises at all for Richmond teachers during the past decade. They received five cost-of-living increases, based on information we got from the school system and the Richmond Education Association during the following fiscal years, which run from July 1 to June 30: •2014-15, 3 percent •2013-14, 2 percent •2008-09, 4 percent •2007-08, 4 percent •2006-07, 2 percent Ralph Westbay, the Richmond school system’s assistant director of financial services, said the cost-of-living pay increases were funded using a mix of city and state funds and were provided to all district teachers regardless of performance. This school year, teachers are getting an additional 1.5 percent in pay, but that’s because they have to work an extra three days, so Westbay said he wouldn’t characterize it as a raise. It also should be noted that teachers got a 1 percent bonus in 2012 but, because that was a one-time payment, it doesn’t count as a raise. We don’t suggest Richmond teachers are living in luxury. In 2013, they had to take five unpaid furlough days, which cut into their pay that year. And, there have been five years in the past 10 in which they received no raises at all: this school year and during the post-recession era from 2010 to 2013. When we called Berry and told him about our findings, he said his remarks at the candidates’ forum referred to the lack of tenure-based raises - not cost-of-living increases. We didn’t find the elaboration in a tape of the forum nor in a Berry campaign flier that says, ""It is inexcusable for teachers to be denied a pay raise for almost 10 years, and for buildings to be falling apart."" In case you’re wondering, teachers in Chesterfield, Henrico and Hanover counties generally saw the same pay hike pattern as Richmond during the past 10 years. Educators in those three counties got pay hikes until 2009 and then generally saw little or no raises from 2010 through 2013, but they have gotten raises in recent years. Our ruling Berry said Richmond teachers have not gotten a raise ""for almost 10 years."" Berry told us he was referring to the lack of tenure raises for teachers when they reach certain years of service. Such raises haven’t been offered for a decade. But he didn’t make that distinction at the candidates’ forum or in his campaign literature. His statement makes it sound as if teachers haven’t gotten any pay increase at all. That runs counter to figures from the school system and the Richmond Education Association that show they’ve gotten five cost-of-living increases during the past 10 years. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB53F00>],/factchecks/2016/apr/18/jack-berry/jack-berry-error-about-richmond-teacher-raises/
"['Elections', 'Florida', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump wrongly says Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush had Florida's winner-take-all primary set
","Donald Trump has been on a tear accusing the Republican establishment of rigging the system to hurt him, despite the fact that he leads the delegate count in the primaries. One of the states where leaders are out to get him is Florida, he says. The state’s March 15 primary was ""winner-take-all,"" which means all of the delegates went to one winner, who ended up being Trump. ""You speak about what’s unfair, so in Florida you had 99 delegates,"" he said in a speech in Rome, N.Y. ""And Jeb Bush had it set -- Jeb Bush or Rubio, both of them. They had it set so that the winner takes everything, because they wanted to make sure that I didn't get anything."" Did Bush and Rubio set the Florida primary for winner-take-all because they wanted to prevent Trump from getting any delegates? Republican officials did hope a winner-take-all primary would benefit Bush or Rubio, but Trump gets some of his key facts wrong. Who decided winner-take-all In February 2015, state Sen. Garrett Richter, R-Naples, chair of an elections committee, announced that he would introduce a bill to set Florida’s presidential primary on March 15, 2016. In the primaries of 2008 and 2012, Florida had gone rogue with its primary date, with state GOP legislators setting the date of Florida’s primary earlier than national leaders wanted. (Early states like Iowa and New Hampshire are picky about other states’ primary dates.) In 2012, national leaders punished Florida by taking away half of its delegates. The March 15 date for 2016 meant Florida was back to following the national party’s suggestions. ""We want Florida to be meaningful and relevant in the presidential elections,"" Richter told the Miami Herald in February 2015. ""We don't want to come under any penalties and we want to have the candidates come to Florida and actively campaign."" Richter also said at the time that it would help Florida’s favorite sons -- Bush, a former governor, and Rubio, a U.S. senator, if they decided to run. (Rubio announced in April and Bush announced in June.) Richter told PolitiFact Florida that leading up to introducing his bill ""I had absolutely no conversations whatsoever with Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio or any of their representatives or campaign or anything."" Because the state was back to following the rules on the date, it had an option whether to set the primary as winner-take-all or to award delegates proportionally. State officials decided to go with winner-take-all. But Richter said that there were no conversations among leadership or the Senate about Trump when setting winner-take-all. ""Not once did Trump’s name come up at any point in time,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. At the time, the winner-take-all choice was talked about as a gift to Bush, who was viewed as the top Florida candidate early on. ""The winner-take-all primary was a very good thing for Jeb -- before Marco got in,"" Ana Navarro, a Bush supporter told the Tampa Bay Times in May 2015. ""When people, including me, were calling their legislators, telling them to make it winner-take-all, we were all still under the mistaken impression that Marco wasn't going to run."" The bill sailed through the Legislature unanimously, and Gov. Rick Scott signed it March 19, 2015. (This was months before Trump’s June announcement that he would be running.) On May 16, the Republican Party of Florida’s Executive Board formally accepted the state plan and announced a winner-take-all election. (The board voted unanimously, including vice chair Joe Gruters, who would later go on to be Trump’s co-chair.) ""Florida will now be the first winner-take-all primary in the country, this ensures that all presidential campaigns will have to spend a considerable amount of time in Florida speaking to Republicans from Pensacola to Key West and everywhere in-between,"" said party chair Blaise Ingoglia. PolitiFact Florida asked Gruters: Is there any proof that Bush or Rubio had winner-take-all set? ""Not that I’m aware of,"" he said. ""My guess is they wouldn’t have to. Looking at all the (Republican) people voting in the Legislature, they were 80 percent Bush guys and the other 20 percent were Rubio guys."" We found no evidence that state legislators and party officials were even thinking about Trump when they were setting the date. Trump said he might run in January 2015 and started giving speeches, including at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February. It wasn’t until July -- the month after Trump announced his candidacy  -- that the New York billionaire started to lead in many national polls. It was clear that Florida Republican powerbrokers hoped that winner-take-all would help Bush or Rubio win. But in the end, that wasn’t the case. Bush suspended his campaign a few weeks before Florida’s primary and Rubio ended up only winning his home county of Miami-Dade while Trump swept the rest of the state. Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said that Bush ""had no role at all"" in setting the winner-take-all system.  A spokesman for Rubio declined to respond. Our ruling Trump says that Bush and Rubio ""had it set so that the winner takes everything, because they wanted to make sure that I didn't get anything"" in the Florida primary. It wasn’t Bush or Rubio who set those rules for the March 15, 2016, primary. It was the Florida Legislature that passed the bill setting the date, allowing the state GOP to decide whether to make it winner-take-all. By that point, Trump was a potential candidate, but he wasn’t seen as a major threat to Rubio or Bush -- especially in Florida -- at that point. We rate Trump’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB34640>],/factchecks/2016/apr/18/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-marco-rubio-and-jeb-bush-had-flo/
"['Welfare', 'Missouri', 'Catherine Hanaway']","
Hanaway wrong about Missouri's rate of moving people from welfare to work
","At the March 17 Republican gubernatorial debate, former Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives Catherine Hanaway made a strong statement about the effectiveness of welfare in Missouri. ""We're the worst state in the country at moving people from welfare to work,"" Hanaway said. Worst in the country is a serious indictment. We wanted to know where Hanaway found her information — and if Missouri really does rank dead last. We got in touch with Will Scharf, policy director of Hanaway for Governor, and he pointed us to a 2015 Welfare Report Card issued by the Heartland Institute. The Heartland Institute is a conservative think tank. Its report evaluates and ranks states' policies under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, the assistance program for low-income families established when Congress passed a welfare-to-work reform act in 1996. The report assigns a letter grade based on the TANF policies of each state. It awards higher grades for states with strict work requirements, shorter lifetime eligibility limits, stiffer sanctions and other features. Missouri received an F from the Heartland Institute, the lowest score in the nation. But at the debate, Hanaway didn't say we earned an F, or that our welfare policies are the worst in the country. She specifically claimed Missouri is the worst at moving people from welfare to work, and that's where things get complicated. Why people leave TANF The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services tracks the reasons families stop receiving TANF benefits in each state. Employment, exceeding the time limit, receiving sanctions and voluntarily closing one's case are all possible options. In Missouri, 81 percent of families stopped receiving benefits due to employment in 2014, the most recent data. That's far from the worst welfare-to-work rate in the country — it's the highest. By comparison, the national percentage for leaving TANF for employment is just 15.8 percent. But there's a twist: The secret to Missouri's success might be the same reasons Heartland Institute gave the Show-Me state a failing grade. We spoke to Liz Schott, senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who told us that Missouri's longer lifetime limit and lighter sanctions meant fewer cases were closed for reasons other than employment. The HHS data blurs what's actually going on in another way. Schott explained that families will often voluntarily end their benefits when a family member gets a job. In this case, other states might have higher rates of cases closing due to employment, but it isn't getting recorded that way. What happens to families after they leave TANF is also rarely tracked. There is no standard federal measure, and it isn't common at the state level either. That makes it tough to evaluate the success of any given state at moving people from welfare to work and keeping them there. Missouri's new law When the Heartland report came out in March 2015, it caught the attention of Missouri Republicans. Inspired by the report, Sen. David Sater, R-Cassville, sponsored the Strengthening Missouri Families Act, which called for strict restrictions on TANF benefits and passed after an override of Gov. Jay Nixon's veto. The law, which took effect in January, cuts the lifetime limit on benefits from five years to 3 1/2, institutes sanctions that cut benefits in half if a recipient fails to complete required training and employment-seeking activities, and cuts them off completely if the requirements aren't met in ten weeks. Our ruling Catherine Hanaway called Missouri the worst state in the country at moving people from welfare to work Her source was a report by the conservative Heartland Institute. But that report assigned grades based on a state's TANF policies, not the percentage of people leaving TANF for employment. By that measure, according to federal statistics, Missouri isn't the worst state, it's the best in the country. The numbers may be a bit imprecise, but they more than show Missouri far from last place. We rate Hanaway's statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5169521d-26e2-4093-93a5-9211091966cf",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC929440>],/factchecks/2016/apr/18/catherine-hanaway/hanaway-wrong-about-missouris-rate-moving-people-w/
"['City Government', 'Pennsylvania', 'Lauren Hitt']","
For the right city employee, Jim Kenney ‘can’t fault’ DROP
","High profile city employees have gone the DROP route for years. They’ve ""retired,"" collected a lump sum of cash by cashing in their Deferred Retirement Option Program payment and then come back to work for the city days, months or years later. In 2011, the controversy surrounding DROP led to six council members resigning or losing their seat. Jim Kenney was not one of them. He didn’t use DROP and was outspoken against it as a councilman, calling for the program to be eliminated. Now it appears Kenney is cool with DROP — for the right employees. The Inquirer revealed last week Kenney’s chief tech officer, Charles Brennan, took a DROP payment of $337,695 in 2006 when he retired from the police department. He now makes $165,000 a year in his current position. Mitchell J. Yanak retired from the police department in 2003, took a $99,537 DROP payment and now makes $142,800. Jim Kenney’s director of communications, Lauren Hitt, told the newspaper ""It was decided that their decision to take DROP was not a disqualification because they both retired from the city many years ago and clearly did not intend to abuse DROP. While Mayor Kenney personally doesn’t support DROP, he can’t fault highly qualified city employees for appropriately utilizing a benefit that’s available to them."" The statement stands in stark contrast with what Hitt said in January while expressing Kenney’s thoughts about City Commissioner Anthony Clark. Clark, who’s been accused of rarely going to work and didn’t vote in several elections despite being in charge of them, filed for DROP. He’ll be able to receive $495,000 when his current four-year term ends. The Inquirer wrote of the Kenney administration’s reactions like this: ""Word of his signing on for DROP drew a swift rebuke from the new mayor. ‘It’s a slap in the face to all Philadelphians,’ Mayor Kenney said Thursday night through spokeswoman Lauren Hitt, ‘especially all our city workers who show up and do their jobs well every day.’ Hitt confirmed to Billy Penn the above quote was intended to be about Clark’s decision to apply for DROP. But she doesn’t see this as a change in stance. ""Brennan and Yanak retired from the PPD 10 and 13 years ago, respectively, where they did excellent work,"" Hitt said. ""Clark is regularly absent from work and despite being in charge of the City’s elections, didn’t even vote – I’m not sure you could find many Philadelphians who would classify him as a ""highly-qualified city employee."" We followed up by asking whether Kenney is of the opinion it’s OK for people to take DROP if they are good employees and don’t work for the city for a while? She responded, ""What Clark did is a slap in the face because he added insult to injury. He doesn’t show up to vote, he doesn’t show up to work and now he’s going to collect the DROP. If you don’t show up to work, you shouldn’t get a salary let alone a retirement package. ""As a result, there’s no contradiction with what I send this week regarding Brennan and Yanak. Clark isn’t a ‘high-quality employee,’ he’s an elected official with an abysmal attendance record, and he’s not ‘appropriately utilizing’ DROP."" But Kenney’s position on DROP for Brennan and Yanak doesn’t square with his past statements, either during his time on Council and or on the campaign trail. He reminded people last year while he was running for mayor he voted against DROP. In a fundraising email, Kenney criticized mayoral candidate Lynne Abraham for taking DROP and speaking against legislation he had sponsored that led to larger payments for retirees when the city’s pension fund outperforms its goals. Earlier this month, it was also reported Kenney decided against hiring John T. McGrath as fire chief because he had taken a partial DROP payment. Hitt said no prospective candidate for that position was disqualified due to their history with DROP. We rate Kenney’s statement of support for Brennan and Yanak on taking DROP payments a full flop.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6CE740>],/factchecks/2016/apr/18/lauren-hitt/right-city-employee-jim-kenney-cant-fault-drop/
"['Immigration', 'Population', 'Virginia', 'Don Beyer']","
Don Beyer wrongly says U.S. population would be shrinking without immigrants
","In the immigration debate, U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-8th, says he’s ""just amazed"" that Republican don't think of the country's employment needs. ""But for immigration, we would have a contracting population, and a contracting population means a contracting economy,"" he said during an April 12 radio interview with Bill Press, a liberal talk show host who broadcasts from Washington. ""So where are the workers going to come from 10 years from now, 15 years from now, but for healthy immigration policies?"" Beyer asked. He said immigration critics ""don’t think - not even just long-term, but short-term - about the employee needs this country has."" What caught our attention is the congressman’s claim that the U.S. population would be falling without immigration. We wondered if he’s right. Thomas Scanlon, Beyer’s director of communications, pointed us to a study released by the Pew Research Center in September. It examined U.S. immigration trends since 1965 and offered projections through 2065. But the Pew study - citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau - undercuts much of Beyer’s claim. It says, ""If no immigrants had entered the country after 1965, when the U.S. population numbered 193 million, the nation’s population still would have grown - to 252 million people by 2015, rather than 324 million."" In other words, the U.S. population grew by 131 million -- or 68 percent -- during the past 50 years. Without documented and undocumented immigrants and their descendants, Pew says the population would have increased 59 million - or 31 percent. Moving forward, Pew projects the U.S. population to expand from 324 million last year to 441 million in 2065 - a 36 percent increase. With no immigration after 2015, Pew says the population still would grow but only to 338 million in 2065. That would be a 4 percent increase over 50 years. Here’s another way to look at it: Pew predicts that 88 percent of the nation’s population growth during the next 50 years will be linked ""to future immigrants and their descendants."" That’s a big surge from the past 50 years, when ""the arrival of new immigrants and the births of their children and grandchildren account for 55 percent of the population increase,"" according to Pew. There’s one more finding in Pew’s projections that should be considered. Let’s go back to Pew’s projection that if immigration ended in 2015, the U.S. population would expand from last year’s 324 million million to 338 million in 2065. All of that growth and more would occur by 2045, according to Pew, when the population would peak at 343 million. During the next 20 years, the population would decrease by 5 million. In other words, Pew projects that after 2045 all of the U.S. population growth - which factors births, deaths and migration in and out of the country - will be attributable to the latest two generations of immigrants and their children. . Our ruling Beyer said, ""But for immigrants, we would have a contracting population."" A Pew study cited by Beyer’s office doesn’t support the congressman’s claim. It shows that the U.S. population would have expanded by about half of its 68 percent growth during the past 50 years if no immigration had taken place. Looking ahead, Pew projects that 88 percent of the nation’s growth during the next 50 years will come from new immigrants, their children and grandchildren. But starting in 2045, the report says, all of the net growth will come from immigrants. Beyer’s statement, in the present tense, wrongly suggests that without immigrants the U.S. population now would be in decline. But some context needs to be added. His statement came while he was talking about the need for immigrants to fill U.S. jobs ""10 years from now, 15 years from now."" In the future - say, 30 years from now - the Pew projections point to Beyer being right. But not now, or in 10 or 15 years. So we rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA9C640>],/factchecks/2016/apr/18/don-beyer/don-beyer-wrongly-says-us-population-would-be-shri/

NC Gov. Pat McCrory defends HB2, says it would have affected every private employer in Charlotte
","North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory defended a law striking down a local LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance as a move against government intrusion Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press.   The city council of Charlotte, N.C., passed the ordinance in late February outlawing discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender people in the city. Even though the protections were wide-ranging, the law has been dubbed the ""bathroom ordinance"" because it prohibited businesses from denying transgender people access to the bathroom consistent with the gender they identify with. In response, the North Carolina Legislature held an emergency session a month later and quickly sent a bill repealing the Charlotte ordinance — and prohibiting ones like it — to McCrory’s desk. McCrory’s signature prompted a national backlash from the gay community, businesses such as PayPal and celebrities including Bruce Springsteen. From the beginning, McCrory has characterized the now-defunct ordinance as extreme government overreach in statements, videos and most recently his national interview with NBC host Chuck Todd. ""The city of Charlotte passed a bathroom ordinance mandate on every private-sector employer in Charlotte, N.C,"" McCrory said April 17. ""It's not government's business to tell the private sector what their bathroom, locker room, or shower practices should be. Not only the private business, but also the Y.M.C.A. and other non-profit organizations."" When Todd pressed McCrory to explain the lack of dialogue ahead of the Legislature’s one-day special session to pass the law, he returned to his talking point: ""But again, I don't think government should be telling the private sector what their restroom and shower law should be, to allow a man into a woman's restroom, or a shower facility at a YMCA, for example."" Is it true that the Charlotte ordinance would have dictated the bathroom practices of the entire private sector? ""The Charlotte ordinance was clearly a mandate on every private business open to the public,"" Josh Ellis, McCrory’s communications director, told PolitiFact. Unlike his spokesman, McCrory didn’t specify that the ""mandate"" applies to businesses ""open to the public."" The distinction is important for this fact-check. Broadly speaking, the Charlotte ordinance expanded existing protections for race, color, religion and national origin to also cover marital and familial status, sexual orientation, and gender identity and expression. The ordinance also struck down a section exempting the YMCA, YWCA and similar dormitories from a law ensuring equal access to services and facilities based on sex. Under the ordinance, it would have been illegal: 1. for the government of Charlotte to do business with anyone who had discriminated against those categories; 2. to deny ""the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of a place of public accommodation"" based on those categories; 3. and to make and circulate any statements or signs indicating that public accommodation will be refused based on those categories. Key to this fact-check are the words ""place of public accommodation,"" which refers to any business offering services or goods to the public, per Charlotte’s municipal code. The definition is broad, but not as all-encompassing as McCrory makes it sound. It would have been illegal for places such as stores, hospitals, movie theaters, restaurants and hotels to prohibit transgender customers from using the bathroom or locker room with the gender he or she identifies with, according to a factsheet forwarded to us by city attorney Bob Hagemann. Hagemann also noted that the ordinance only protected customers, not employees. (The ordinance did not include protections for firing or hiring based on sexual orientation or gender identity.) In other words, the ordinance wouldn’t have really impacted businesses that don’t typically deal with customers or patrons in person, such as call centers, manufacturing plants, distribution centers and self-employed workers without office space.  What’s more, the ordinance would have specifically exempted establishments closed to the public like private clubs, advocacy and religious organizations with strongly held beliefs like churches or charities, and nonprofits like homeless shelters, according to the factssheet.  So what about the YMCA? Hagemann wasn’t sure if the YMCA, as a Christian charity, would have been exempted under the ordinance. ""I don’t know enough about how they operate to know whether they would fall under one or more of the exceptions,"" Hagemann said. Ellis, McCrory's spokesperson, told PolitiFact the governor's office disagrees with Hagemann's interpretation of the ordinance. ""The definition does not specifically exclude 'charities' or 'nonprofits.'  In fact, the YMCA makes entertainment and recreation (and probably other services) available to the public, which would put it under the definition of a place of public accommodation,"" Ellis said. ""Bottom line, we see the ordinance as applying to the YMCA.""  The YMCA of Charlotte did not respond immediately to calls or an email for comment. The YWCA of Central Carolinas, meanwhile, currently has a policy of allowing members to use the ""the bathroom/locker room that is appropriate for them based on their gender identity"" and supports the repeal of HB2. Our ruling McCrory said, ""The city of Charlotte passed a bathroom ordinance mandate on every private-sector employer in Charlotte."" This is an exaggeration. The ordinance would have applied to place of public accommodation, like hotels and stores and other places selling goods and services to the public. While that is a big category, the ordinance would not have applied to private clubs, nonprofits or organizations with viewpoints that would have been at odds with the law, nor would have it really impacted business that don't deal with customers.  The talking point contains an element of truth but exaggerates the scope of the law. We rate his statement Mostly False. Update: After we published this fact-check, we heard back from Josh Ellis, McCrory's spokesman. It has been updated to include his comments. The ruling remains unchanged.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2d1960bf-248e-4286-ac92-d47880bff82d",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB71540>],/factchecks/2016/apr/17/pat-mccrory/nc-gov-pat-mccrory-defends-hb2-meet-press/
"['Rhode Island', 'Children', 'Criminal Justice', 'Public Safety', 'John Pagliarini']","
Do we value our pets more than our children?
","There are two unattended vehicles in a Rhode Island parking lot on a hot summer day. One has a child inside, and the other, an animal. Police are called. In the case of the pet, police or animal control can take ""all steps that are reasonably necessary to remove an animal from a motor vehicle"" if the animal is at risk. They are to leave a note for the motorist and bring the pet to an animal hospital for observation. The motorist must pay all costs associated with the rescue, and can face up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $1,000 or both, according to the state’s ""Animal confinement in motor vehicles prohibited"" law.   In the case of a child, police can ""provide a verbal warning"" to the parent or caregiver about risks and dangers associated with leaving a kid in a car. No fines or sanctions can be imposed, according to the state’s ""Child passenger protection"" statute. Wait, what? Sen. John Pagliarini highlighted this discrepancy in a senate hearing in March. This seemed outrageous, so we called and asked him to explain.   He told us if you look at the law for leaving a pet unattended in a car (§ 4-1-3.2) and compare it to the law for leaving a child unattended in a car (§ 31-22-22.1), the penalties for people who leave pets behind are more severe. ""It looks as though you’re in more trouble if you leave your pet in the car than if you leave your child in the car,"" Pagliarini said in an interview with The Journal. ""One would think we value our pets more than our children."" Pagliarini said he wasn’t sure if existing child neglect laws would apply in this case, but he encouraged a further look. ""I hope I’m wrong,"" Pagliarini said. Well, we’re going to find out. Looking only at the two laws outlined above, it seems Pagliarini is correct. For example, the pet law explicitly authorizes police to break into a car with a pet inside. For a child, there is no such language. We asked Sgt. Michael Wheeler in the Providence Police Department’s Youth Service Bureau what happens in practice. ""If there's a child in the car and I need to break into the car, I’m breaking into the car,"" he said. ""We deal with everything else later on."" Wheeler told us that in cases like this, Providence police are to get the child out of the car first. Then they take the child to Hasbro Children’s Hospital for assessment and contact the Department of Children, Youth and Families.   Providence’s police chief, Col. Hugh Clements, who serves as the president of the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association, said the same thing. Police would immediately contact EMTs and get the child help. They take the child to Hasbro even if the parent, or driver, shows up during this whole process. At the hospital DCYF caseworkers, along with the hospital staff, can assess whether the child is in imminent danger or needs to be held further, Wheeler said. Under § 40-11-5 police, social workers or doctors are allowed to take a child into custody for 72 hours without parental consent if the child has any injuries caused by ""other than accidental means."" Leaving your child in a hot car on a 99-degree day might fall into that category, Wheeler said. Kerri White, a public information officer for DCYF, said her department might open a Child Protective Services investigation after a report like this.   If investigators find the child is in danger, DCYF is to place the child on a protective hold (explained earlier) and seek a child protective order from the Family Court and remove him or her from the home. Amy Kempe, a spokeswoman in the attorney general’s office, said authorities can use existing child abuse and child neglect statutes (like § 11-9-5)  to bring criminal charges against parents or caregivers depending on ""the facts and circumstances of a specific incident."" ""Please note, cruelty to or neglect of a child is a felony with a maximum penalty of three years, $1,000, or both,"" said Kempe in an emailed statement. Kempe pointed to the state’s ""Brendan's Law,"" which protects kids from serious bodily injury  — meaning things like creating a substantial threat of death, broken bones, impairment of organs, etc. — or any physical injury  — which the law defines as an injury ""which arises other than from the imposition of non excessive corporal punishment."" With these standards, a parent or caregiver could face charges of first-degree child abuse, which carries a penalty of up to 20 years in jail and a fine of up to $10,000. Or they could be charged with second-degree child abuse and face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000. Enter Sen. Lou Raptakis and his amendment to the ""child passenger protection"" law, which was introduced in the Senate on Jan.13. His problem with the way the current law stands is that Brendan’s Law and the other statutes Kempe mentions only apply if the child is injured, unlike in the animal-husbandry bill, where the motorist is culpable no matter what. ""It’s kind of absurd that a child doesn’t have the same protection as an animal does,"" Raptakis said. In his amendment, which he hopes will be up for vote later this month, a parent or caregiver would face the similar penalties as in the animal bill if they leave a child under 7 unattended in a car for more than 5 minutes. 
Our ruling  Sen. Pagliarini says ""You’re in more trouble if you leave your pet in the car than if you leave your child in the car."" We looked at the laws, and at face value, he’s right. But, through the power of the DCYF, police, hospital staff and child neglect statutes like Brendan’s Law, parents or caregivers can get in a heap of trouble if they leave a child in these circumstances. Because the statement leaves out important details about actual practice, we rate it: Half True.

Republican state Rep. cites higher than average Medicaid enrollment in two NH counties
","At a news conference last month, U.S. House candidate and state Rep. Jack Flanagan explained his vote to continue the state’s expanded Medicaid program. Flanagan, a Republican, supported the legislation because those in the second congressional district were relying on the expanded plan, he told reporters. ""When I looked at the actual layout -- Coos County, Sullivan County, there was a significant number of people -- I think it’s almost 5 percent if not more -- in those counties. So, looking ahead and knowing those people could use the support, that’s why I voted"" for the program, he said. Flanagan’s assertion caught our eye. While the overall number of those on the expanded program has been stated repeatedly – about 48,000 individuals – less has been said about who those people are and where they live.

So we decided to check out Flanagan's statement. Let’s start with the district boundaries. New Hampshire’s second congressional district stretches from the very top of the state to the very bottom, and generally covers the western half. It’s currently represented by U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster, a Democrat. As Flanagan noted, the district encompasses all of Coos and Sullivan counties. It also includes all of Cheshire County. Much of Grafton, Merrimack and Hillsborough counties are in the district, too, along with a slice of Rockingham. That’s a lot of space, and as you might expect, use of the expanded Medicaid, which offers subsidized health care to people making less than $16,000 a year, isn’t uniform across the district. Towns and cities in sparse Coos and populated Merrimack counties face very different economic challenges, after all. The next piece of the puzzle is the actual usage of the program. The state’s Health and Human Services department has produced a number of maps through its division of Public Health Services that show, as of January, how many residents across the state use expanded Medicaid.According to this information, Coos County saw the greatest use of the expanded Medicaid program, with 5.38 percent participating. Sullivan County, the second one named by Flanagan, had 4.28 percent of its residents enrolled in the program. These figures include just the expanded program, not all Medicaid enrollees. As expected, numbers vary in the other counties included in the district. Only 3.77 percent of the population of Cheshire County is enrolled. Merrimack County has 3.75 percent of residents participating, while Hillsborough has 3.58 percent. Grafton County is broken up in an unusual way on the map -- Hanover and Lebanon are broken out. Between them, the communities have only 1.72 percent of their residents in the program. The rest of the county has a 4.19 percent enrollment. While the numbers can be sliced and diced further -- the state also issued a town-by-town breakdown of enrollments -- Flanagan was speaking about county numbers, so this rough breakdown should be sufficient. The two counties Flanagan specified, Coos and Sullivan, indeed have the highest participation rate in the expanded Medicaid program. Only the former is over 5 percent, though. Bolstering his argument, both have higher enrollments than the state as a whole, which stands at about 3.5 percent. When reached for comment, the representative pointed to the same set of data from the state. ""I was considering Coos when I made that statement, however Grafton and Sullivan counties are still high, percentage wise,"" Flanagan wrote in an email. Our ruling U.S. House candidate and State Rep. Jack Flanagan said that ""almost 5 percent if not more"" of the population of Coos and Sullivan counties were enrolled in the state’s expanded Medicaid program. In the second congressional district, one county has more than 5 percent enrollment in the state’s expanded Medicaid program and another is pretty close. Coos county indeed breaks the 5 percent mark. Sullivan, at 4.28 percent, which have the first and second-highest participation rates in the state, respectively. We rate Flanagan’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA9B940>],/factchecks/2016/apr/15/jack-falanagan/republican-candidate-congress-cites-higher-average/

'Our City' backers give incomplete account of reported sexual assaults by Austin ride-hailed drivers
","A fund-raising letter from opponents of a May 2016 Austin ballot proposition affecting drivers for ride-hailing services made us wonder about assaults of residents who purchase a ride through Uber or Lyft. The April 8, 2016, letter, signed by more than 30 women including current and former Austin City Council members, solicits donations to Our City, Our Safety, Our Choice, which urges Austin residents to vote ""no"" on the proposition before voters May 7. At issue: Whether to replace a city ordinance requiring ride-hailing services to submit drivers to background checks including fingerprinting with a mandate preferred by the services which doesn’t require fingerprinting. The letter’s first section refers to a tally of Travis County sexual assaults in 2015 before noting that many assaults go unreported, a conclusion the letter attributes to a Jan. 28, 2016, press release from SAFE, which stands for Stop Abuse for Everyone; the alliance brings together the Austin Children’s Shelter and SafePlace, which says it provides safety for individuals and families affected by sexual and domestic violence. In a new paragraph, the letter says safety ""must be a priority for our city, and that includes the safety of riders."" Then the letter says: ""In the words of one of SAFE Alliance’s forensic nurses ‘I have taken care of about a thousand people in the immediate aftermath of sexual assault . . . I am now seeing a pattern of rape reports that all involve ridesharing and it is of extreme concern to me.’ ""SAFE describes ‘seeing too many sexual assault survivors that report being attacked by their ridesharing drivers, at a rate of one per month in our offices.’"" One reported assault-by-driver a month? Group points to web post We asked the campaign coordinator for Our City, Our Safety, Our Choice about the basis of the quoted statement. By email, Mykle Tomlinson replied that the letter originated with supportive women, not the group. He also pointed us to the Jan. 28, 2016, web post by Kelly White, CEO of the SAFE Alliance. And at first, it looked to us like the anti-proposition group’s claim was fully backed by what White wrote. In fact, after White’s post declares the rate of ""one per month,"" it says that’s an undercount, adding: ""And that’s just the people we see, which is not nearly everyone. Some go to other organizations, some go to the police, and sadly many go nowhere at all."" That well could be. At the least, a January 2016 Austin Police Department break-out of complaints about sex assaults connected to local ride-hailed vehicles or taxi rides supports speculation there may have been more than one alleged sex assault a month in 2015 connected to a ride-hailed driver. The department’s list, which we fielded for another fact check, indicates that from Jan. 15, 2015 through Jan. 1, 2016, police fielded 23 complaints concerning drivers for Uber, Lyft or, in two cases, ""independent"" ride-hailed vehicles. Entries on the list indicate possible crimes ranging from assault ""sexual nature"" to sexual assault to rape. We asked the Uber and Lyft companies for input about this claim. By email, Uber spokeswoman Jennifer Mullin said that of the SAFE-described assault allegations, ""we have not been notified of any arrests or charges of this nature against a driver while using the Uber platform in Austin."" We didn’t hear back from Lyft. Pattern in 2015 hasn’t extended into 2016 So, case closed on this ""one per month"" claim? Not quite, we found, because Austin’s SAFE reports no such reports from sex-assault victims in 2016. White, whom we reached by phone, said she wrote her January post to endorse an attempt by Austin Mayor Steve Adler to encourage, not require, individuals to provide their fingerprints before being permitted to work for Austin ride-hailing services. And, White told us, the ""one per month"" statement was rooted in the experiences of the alliance’s forensic nurses who, starting in June 2015, were newly available on the group’s campus to provide no-charge sexual assault forensic exams like those needed for evidence purposes; a clinic dedicated to providing the exams, Eloise House, opened on the campus in August 2015. By phone, alliance spokeswoman Victoria Berryhill said the alliance had become the sole Austin-area provider of the exams previously performed by another group in hospitals. Through 2015, White said, six women each told a nurse she’d been taken home and assaulted by a driver for the Uber or Lyft service. ""The pattern was of young women alone late at night"" or in ""early morning hours, getting under the influence, getting into a vehicle with a stranger,"" White said, ""and then they were getting taken back to their homes and they were getting assaulted in their own homes."" However, in the first few months of 2016, Austin’s SAFE nurses fielded no such driver-assault reports. That is, she said, ""we are not seeing"" the pattern ""any more."" Our ruling Supporters of the anti-proposition group wrote that Austin’s SAFE has seen in its offices ""sexual assault survivors that report being attacked by their ridesharing drivers, at a rate of one per month."" According to SAFE’s CEO, that count reflected what forensic nurses heard from victims over the last half of 2015. Separately, an Austin police tally of assault complaints tied to ride-hailed drivers might signal an even greater per-month average for that year. However, we learned, SAFE heard no such reports from sexual assault victims through the first three-plus months of 2016, perhaps a welcome indication that the pattern reported for 2015 hasn't persisted. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Ellen Troxclair lacks facts for claim about chances of sex assault by an Austin taxi driver
","An Austin City Council member made a honk-the-horn statement about passenger assaults as she advocated for voter approval of a proposition that would shrink what the city requires in background checks of drivers who work with ride-hailing services. If approved, the proposal on Austin’s May 7, 2016, ballot would rescind a city ordinance requiring ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft to submit drivers to background checks that include fingerprinting. The revised mandate, preferred by the services, would require background checks but not fingerprinting--unlike what the city requires of taxi drivers and ride-for-hire workers like shuttle, limousine and pedicab drivers. The pro-proposition member, Ellen Troxclair, opened by saying ""ride-sharing is safe"" during her appearance at an April 10, 2016, forum hosted by the League of Women Voters of the Austin Area. Troxclair, who represents District 8 in southwest Austin, elaborated: ""The truth is, if you look at the statistics, based on when TNCs came to town and today, you are about nine times more likely to be assaulted by a taxi driver."" TNC means a Transportation Network Company summoned through a mobile phone app. ""Let me say that again,"" Troxclair said. ""When you look at the number of taxi drivers and the number of TNC drivers and the number of complaints that APD,"" the Austin Police Department, ""has received over that time, you are about nine times more likely to be assaulted by a taxi driver."" Is this so? We ultimately found no one can definitively rule on the relative chances of an assault resulting from riding in an Austin taxi versus a ride-hailed vehicle. Meantime, experts on statistics agreed that Troxclair relied on the wrong indicators to reach her dramatic conclusion. Those analysts included Matthew Hersh, a University of Texas lecturer and proposition opponent who called the calculation fueling Troxclair’s statement one of the worst misrepresentations of statistics he’s seen. Austin Police Department data To our request for Troxclair's backup information, her aide Michael Searle emailed a document he said Troxclair received from the Austin Police Department listing all reported complaints to the police about assaults in taxi cabs or ride-hailed vehicles since 2014. Searle told us Troxclair’s office fielded the APD document in a Jan. 27, 2016, email from Brian Manley, APD’s chief of staff, who wrote: ""Please find attached the information you requested on sexual assault allegations against cab drivers and TNC drivers."" Manley’s email also included a cautionary note about making safety comparisons based on the raw counts--a note he re-sounded when we asked him about the council member’s ""nine times"" analysis. His email to Troxclair’s office said: ""Keep in mind these are only allegations of a crime, not cases that have been prosecuted,"" he said. ""Also, it is hard to say whether there are more allegations against cab drivers than TNC drivers because we don't know how many rides each provider gave in a given year so we cannot come up with a rate, only the raw number."" The document lists 37 reported incidents from Feb. 26, 2014, through Jan. 21, 2016, breaking out to 14 complaints about cabs, 21 complaints tied to vehicles driven for Uber or Lyft and two complaints related to ""independent"" ride-hailed vehicles. Each date-and-time entry indicates a crime ranging from assault ""sexual nature"" to sexual assault to rape. Noted: The presented timeframe rolled in a stretch of months before ride-hailing services were city-approved though Searle pointed out that the council approved a resolution in March 2013 stating Austinites had been using phone apps to share rides. Uber has said it routinely offered rides in Austin starting in June 2014. But it wasn’t until October 2014 that the council gave permission to the Uber and Lyft companies to operate, effective a month later. If we limit our focus to the 15 months through January 2016 that taxi cabs and ride-hailing services each rolled with city permission, APD's count of cab-connected assault complaints decreases to six. Shrinking the timeframe  leaves unchanged the 23 assault complaints the department lists as related to ride-hailed vehicles. Troxclair’s equation So, how did Troxclair reach her conclusion about the chances of an Austin assault being nine times higher with a cab driver? Searle wrote: ""If the estimate is that there are 15,000 TNC drivers, subject to name-based background checks, and there are 913 cab permits, subject to fingerprint background check, then you are 9 times more likely to be assaulted by a cab driver than a TNC driver in Austin."" A city spokesman, Bryce Bencivengo, told us by phone the city had issued 915 cab permits at the time Troxclair spoke at the forum though he also said that shouldn’t be read as a count of taxi drivers. Bencivengo said the city also has fielded figures from Uber and Lyft indicating their respective counts of Austin drivers, but each company also says the tallies are proprietary, not to be released to the public. We asked Uber and Lyft for such counts; an Uber spokeswoman, Jaime Moore, said by email it has 15,000 Austin-area drivers, though she later said it’s accurate to say it has over 10,000 drivers in that the count fluctuates. Searle said Troxclair reached her ""nine times"" conclusion by dividing the 14 cab-connected complaints since June 2014 by the 913 cab permits (getting 0.015) and comparing that to what you get from juxtaposing the 23 ride-hail complaints versus 15,000 ride-hail drivers in Austin (or 0.0015) -- which actually suggests a 10-fold difference. Other analysts We ran Troxclair’s equation and statement past experts on statistics, each of whom flinched. Hersh, who told us he’s donated services to an anti-proposition group, brought up the timeline weakness in considering several months when taxi cabs were legally operating but ride-hailing services were not. He further said it’s not logical to assume driver counts deliver sufficient information to reach relative safety conclusions. Separately, Rachelle Wilkinson, an adjunct professor of statistics at Austin Community College, said the calculations offered by Troxclair aren’t valid ways to gauge the relative incidences of sexual assaults. It’s ""comparing apples to oranges (number of sexual assault reports to number of drivers),"" Wilkinson said by email. ""A much more valid way to look at the data would be to compare the sexual assault reports to the number of rides given---NOT the number of drivers.  Taxi drivers tend to drive as their profession or job whereas ride-hailing drivers often do it on the side."" That is, the number of rides ""given by taxi drivers is likely much higher (per driver) than the number of rides given by ride-hailing drivers (per driver),"" Wilkinson wrote, adding that ride counts didn’t appear to be part of Troxclair’s backup. Also, Wilkinson suggested, the probability of such assaults appears to be extremely small whether riding in a taxi or a ride-hailed car, she wrote. Carol Gee, a math professor at Austin’s St. Edward’s University, similarly said by email that from the perspective of a passenger seeking a safe ride, ""it is likely more appropriate to measure safety by the number of incidents per trip, rather than the number of incidents per driver."" But absent trip data, the experts concurred, there isn’t a fact-backed justification for Troxclair’s statement. Comparisons possible? So, is there a way to compare the chances of assault in the different kinds of rides? Hersh suggested we consult Julio Gonzalez Altamirano, who writes the Keep Austin Wonky blog. By phone and email, Altamirano noted that Austin ride-hailing services lately carry 200,000 ""riders"" a month, according to a pro-proposition video ad posted April 7, 2016. Meantime, he noted, the Austin Business Journal earlier posted data leading him to estimate there were about 353,000 Austin taxi riders a month in a recent 12-month period. Still, Altamirano said, passenger estimates don’t speak to the types or lengths of trips in taxi cabs versus ride-hailed vehicles. ""The more relevant measure for risk assessment is the share of trips or or time spent in vehicle that lead to an incident. We also have to account for potential differences in the underlying populations,"" Altamirano said. ""If almost everybody that takes a taxi is a businessperson going from or to the airport, there might be fewer drunk men and women relative to"" passengers in ride-hailed vehicles. ""If so, assessing the true risk of each service gets more complicated,"" he said. ""And given that there are millions of trips for both services and a relatively small number of reported incidents, it's very hard to feel confident that there are any clear patterns."" We reached out to Uber and Lyft about Troxclair’s statement, also asking for data on trip counts and lengths. By email, Uber’s Moore said Uber trip counts are ""not public."" A Lyft contact didn’t respond. We also heard back from Troxclair, who stressed by phone that she was clear at the forum that she was qualifying her conclusion by saying it was based on the driver counts for taxi cabs and ride-hailing services. She agreed it would be helpful to have detailed trip-count information. Our ruling Troxclair said statistics show ""you are about nine times more likely to be assaulted by a taxi driver"" in Austin than a driver for a ride-hailing service. This claim shakes out to dividing oranges into apples and getting grapefruits--a ridiculous notion. Vital data, at the least about the number and length of trips by taxi cabs or ride-hailed vehicles, remains to be seen, making it impossible to definitively say which type of driver or ride more likely risks an assault. It's also worth mention that the chances of assault in either seem very low. This leaves the ""nine times"" statement incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
