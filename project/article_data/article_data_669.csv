Reince Priebus says unemployment has been above 8 percent for a record 36 months
","
When President Barack Obama touched down Feb. 15, 2012, in Milwaukee to tout homegrown manufacturing jobs, Republican Gov. Scott Walker greeted him amiably and praised the trip.

Meanwhile, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, former head of the Wisconsin GOP, aired a long list of grievances timed to the visit.

Unemployment was near the top of the list.

""In February 2009, Obama promised that if he didn't have the economy fixed in three years, then his presidency was ‘going to be a one-term proposition,’ "" Priebus wrote in an opinion piece in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""It's been three years, and few Americans would say the economy is healthy.""

He added: ""In fact, the national unemployment rate has been above 8 percent for a record 36 months -- even though Obama promised it would be different. He promised his $825 billion stimulus would keep unemployment below 8 percent. But instead of creating jobs, it just created debt.""

PolitiFact Florida has rated Mostly False the claim that Obama promised the stimulus bill would cap unemployment at 8 percent.

But what about Priebus’ claim that unemployment has topped 8 percent for a record 36 months?

Asked to back up Priebus’ statement, the RNC pointed to a 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

""The rate of unemployment in the United States has exceeded 8 percent since February 2009, making the past three years the longest stretch of high unemployment in this country since the Great Depression,"" says the CBO study.

We double-checked it with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is the gold standard for unemployment statistics. During that time, monthly unemployment has ranged between 8.3 and 10.0 percent.

But the CBO study added an important qualifier that Priebus left out -- ""since the Great Depression.""

The Great Depression-era unemployment rates topped 15 percent annually for six straight years, from 1931 to 1936, and never fell below 8.7 percent over 12 years, according to estimates adopted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In four consecutive years unemployment exceeded 20 percent a year.

Those figures were cited by by PolitiFact National when it found False a 2011 Priebus claim that ""We have unemployment that rivals the Great Depression.""

""Any way you cut it, peak unemployment since the start of the most recent recession, as bad as it has been, remains well under half of the peak it reached during the Great Depression,"" that PolitiFact item concluded.

There’s a qualifier, though, on the Depression-era data, as the PolitiFact item highlighted -- and this is where Priebus hangs his hat.

There are some dissimilarities between the pre-war unemployment data and the current data.

The earlier method counted those age 14 and up, not 16 and up (the standard that began in 1948). In addition, monthly unemployment statistics -- the measure cited by Priebus before Obama’s visit -- were not kept until 1948 as well. Thus, all the statistics during the Great Depression were on an annual basis.

RNC spokesman Ryan Mahoney noted: ""In (the current system) this is a record. BLS is the standard for the modern era. There were no definitive records like it during the Great Depression.""

Still, PolitiFact National concluded the old and new methods are similar, and the economists it interviewed said comparisons between the two are appropriate as long as the differences are disclosed.

And it’s noteworthy that the government itself has adopted the pre-war unemployment estimates -- the ones that show unemployment rates higher than 15 percent for six years running -- as its own. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has declared those estimates official.

We also talked to Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.

He said while the agency did not collect ""official"" estimates of the unemployment rate before 1940, the estimates from that earlier time, when combined with ""official"" figures for 1940 and 1941, suggest ""the unemployment rate exceeded 8 percent for a total span of 12 years, 1930-1941.""

Even with the data differences, ""it is silly to imply that unemployment between 1930 and 1939 was likely to be lower than 8 percent in any of those 10 years,"" Burtless stated.

Our conclusion

Priebus accurately cites monthly unemployment statistics proving a three-year run of unemployment topping 8 percent under Obama. But it’s a ""record"" only in the strict sense, because monthly statistics didn’t exist in the 1930s.

His claim ignores the critical fact that Great Depression unemployment rates -- while not kept monthly -- annually were well above the current rates and for a much longer period.

There’s an element of truth in Priebus’ statement because he cited ""monthly"" statistics, but overall this is misleading.

That is our definition for Mostly False.","[('\nReince Priebus, Republican National Committee chairman, op-ed piece, ""The President has broken many promises,"" Feb. 14, 2012\n\nCongressional Budget Office, ""Understanding and Responding to Persistently High Unemployment,"" February 2012\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, databases on national unemployment, accessed Feb. 22, 2012\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, annual unemployment rates, 1940-2010, 2011\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, ""Employment Status 14 and Over, 1929-47,"" published 1948\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, ""Compensation from before World War I through the Great Depression,"" January 30, 2003\n\nPolitiFact National, item on Priebus Great Depression claim, June 13, 2011\n\nEmail interview with Ryan Mahoney, spokesman, Republican National Committee, Feb. 16, 2012\n\nTelephone interview with Stacey Standish, Bureau of Labor Statistics press officer, Feb. 22, 2012\n\nE-mail interview with Gary Burtless, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, Feb. 21, 2011', 'http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/the-president-has-broken-many-promises-3o46oir-139326298.html')]",/factchecks/2012/feb/29/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-unemployment-has-been-above-8-/

Congressman Scott Garrett claims half of all Americans don’t pay federal income taxes
","
The deadline for filing one’s federal income tax return is fast approaching, but according to U.S. Rep. Scott Garrett, half of the nation won’t pay any money to the government.

The Sussex County Republican claimed during a Feb. 15 interview on WOR-AM that half of all Americans don’t pay federal income taxes. After discussing the federal budget, Garrett cited that statistic when host John Gambling pointed out the economic turmoil unfolding in Greece.

Garrett (R-5th Dist.) responded, ""That’s the absurd situation they’ve got over there where the average person on the street relied so heavily on the government for his livelihood, for his well-being. We don’t want to be in that situation in this country, but we’re getting close to it, when half the Americans don’t pay any income taxes.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Garrett is right, according to research done by two nonpartisan groups. Both groups confirm that about half of all American households do not have to pay any federal income taxes.

Our PolitiFact colleagues around the country have tackled similar statements a few times before and reached the same conclusion.

First, let’s explain the data that supports Garrett’s claim.

To back up the congressman’s point, Garrett spokesman Ben Veghte directed us to a July 2011 report from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.

In that report, the center estimated that about 46 percent of ""tax units"" would pay no federal income tax for 2011 -- the most current estimate available. The center had estimated that 49.5 percent of tax units didn’t pay federal income taxes for 2010.

A tax unit is an individual or married couple that either files a tax return or would have to file one if their income was high enough, Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the center, said in an e-mail. In other words, a tax unit is roughly equivalent to a household, he said.

Of the 46.4 percent of units not paying income taxes for 2011, about half was due to the fact that those units had no taxable income after subtracting the standard deduction and personal exemptions, Williams said.

""The other half qualified for various exclusions, itemized deductions, special exemptions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits that wiped out any tax liability,"" Williams told us. That second group includes tax units benefiting from education and child credits.

Now, let’s talk about the other group backing up Garrett’s statistic.

In April 2011, the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress, released an analysis estimating that slightly more than 50 percent of all tax units would owe no federal income taxes for 2009.

Of those tax units, about 22 percent would have a zero income tax liability and about 30 percent would actually get money back from the government, according to the committee.

So, both groups support Garrett’s claim that roughly half of all American households pay no federal income taxes.

Our ruling

In a radio interview, Garrett claimed ""half the Americans don’t pay any income taxes.""

That claim is backed up by research from two nonpartisan groups -- the Tax Policy Center and the Joint Committee on Taxation. Both groups have estimated that about half of all American households did not owe federal income taxes in recent years.

We rate the statement True.

"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'Jon Husted']","
Jon Husted says statewide ballot issues each cost Ohio $1 million
","
Hundreds of thousands of people signed petitions last year to put a new state elections law, House Bill 194, on the ballot to let voters decide whether to repeal it.

The referendum on House Bill 194 is slated for the Nov. 6 election. But GOP lawmakers who supported the bill are now interested in repealing it in the General Assembly, which would nullify the referendum.

Secretary of State Jon Husted, Ohio’s elections chief, also has said he favors repealing the bill. Husted, a Republican, told a political forum hosted by Associated Press, that repealing the law would help prevent voter confusion and could also save taxpayer money.

""Every time we put a ballot issue on, it costs a million dollars, essentially, to do that,"" he said.

The referendum on HB 194 – if lawmakers do not repeal the law – would be the second voter referendum in Ohio in two years. Voters in November overturned Senate Bill 5, an overhaul of the state’s laws covering collective bargaining for public workers.

That law raised objections from Democrats and labor groups. Its repeal breathed new life into the referendum process as a way to obstruct the agenda of GOP lawmakers who control the General Assembly.

With the HB 194 referendum scheduled for November, and more possible in the future, PolitiFact Ohio decided to dig into Husted’s claim about the cost.

First, we should note that not all statewide ballot issues are voter referendums. Last year, for example, two proposed constitutional amendments were issues on the November ballot.

Husted’s words reference ballot issues, in a broader sense, but when he made this claim it was part of a discussion specifically about the upcoming referendum on HB 194.

We called Husted’s office and a spokesman said the million-dollar price tag is due to the state’s responsibility to educate the public about the law on the ballot.

""To ensure all voters have a chance to familiarize themselves with the issues, Ohio’s constitution requires the secretary of state to place issues appearing on the ballot, in their entirety, in newspapers once a week during the three weeks preceding the election,"" Husted spokesman Matt McClellan said in an e-mail.

McClellan said it cost $2.1 million to meet the requirement last year, when the SB 5 referendum and two proposed constitutional amendments appeared on the November ballot.

The newspaper ads to educate the public were massive – 60 pages of newsprint that were copied about 5 million times and disseminated in newspapers across the state. McClellan said the SB 5 referendum accounted for 57 of the advertisement’s 60 pages because the entire 302-page law had to be printed.

HB 194 would make several changes to elections law, including restricting early voting opportunities. Democrats have called it a ""voter suppression"" bill. It also is a massive text and would require 50 pages of newsprint for the public notice, McClellan said.

Based on the per page cost of last November’s newsprint advertisement, we were able to determine a potential cost of a referendum on HB 194 and the cost of the SB 5 referendum.

Each of the 5 million newspaper ads distributed across the state last fall were 60 pages. That’s a total of about 300 million pages. The total cost of those ads was $2.11 million, meaning each page cost between 0.7 and 0.8 cents.

First, let’s nail down the cost of the SB 5 referendum. Reprinting the entire law and providing other required information, such as arguments for and against the law, required 57 of the 60 pages. The other two ballot issues needed only three pages of the ad.

Based on the per-page cost, the other two ballot issues together cost slightly more than $105,000. That means the SB 5 referendum cost the secretary of state’s office more than $2 million.

McClellan said reprinting HB 194 will require 50 pages of newsprint. Since the constitution requires all ballot issues be placed in newspapers across the state, we can assume the state would have to pay for another 5 million copies – the same number of ads it had to buy for last year’s ballot issues.

So that means 250 million pages would be needed. At 0.7 cents per page, the total comes to about $1.75 million.

We checked our math with the secretary of state’s office and McClellan said it reached the same conclusion.

Where does that leave us?

Husted’s claim is partially accurate. He made his comment while specifically talking about the referendum for HB 194 and his underlying point here was that referendums cost the state a lot of money. He stated a figure of $1 million for each issue, and the cost of advertising the SB 5 referendum and the estimated cost for HB 194 each exceed that figure.

But Husted specifically said ""ballot issue,"" which on its face would include more than just referendums to repeal legislation. And he presented the $1 million figure as a rule of thumb, which it is not.

The cost of the advertisements will vary, depending on how many pages it takes to print the language needed to educate the voters about the issues. In the case of the SB 5 referendum, that required 57 pages because the law to be repealed had to be reprinted. That length is In contrast, though, to the $105,000 price tag for the two other statewide ballot issues last November.

That is important information needed to fully evaluate Husted’s claim.

Gingrich: Main reason for unemployment decline is shrinking workforce
","
A visit to the Atlanta-based Neal Boortz radio show gave Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich a chance to partake in three of his favorite pastimes with a single sentence.

The former U.S. House speaker railed against President Barack Obama. He took a swing at the media. He tackled the economy, which some see as the president’s Achilles’ heel in this year’s election.

Gingrich said the media won’t report news that dents Obama’s reputation. He gave the nation’s improving unemployment rate as an example.  

""That’s why on Friday when the unemployment numbers came out you didn’t get anybody in the news media pointing out that the biggest contribution to the unemployment number was 1.2 million people leaving the workforce,"" Gingrich said.

We at PolitiFact Georgia felt obliged to address the media’s alleged lack of due diligence by deploying our Truth-O-Meter.

We contacted the Gingrich campaign, but it did not respond. We took a closer look at the data ourselves.

Lately, it’s popular among Republicans to question whether the economy is truly recovering. We often hear claims that the improving unemployment rate doesn’t tell the whole story or somehow underplays the nation’s economic troubles.

We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official keeper of employment data. The numbers it issued Feb. 3, the day Gingrich mentioned on the Boortz show, said that the unemployment rate dropped to 8.3 percent in January.

We talked to four labor economists about this data. They agreed that Gingrich is using it wrong.

In fact, those who performed a close analysis of the numbers agreed the data suggest the opposite.

The BLS surveys a sample of the U.S. population to determine which respondents are working; which ones are not but are looking for a job; and which ones don’t have a job, are able to work, but are not looking for work.

It calculates the unemployment rate by taking the number of people who are unemployed but are looking for work and dividing it by the sum of two categories -- those who are employed, plus those who are not but looking for work.

This means the unemployment rate does not account for an important category of people -- those who don’t have a job and are able to work, but who are not actively searching for employment. This ""not in the labor force"" category may include people who stopped looking for work because they’re going to school, taking care of children, have retired, gave up looking or any number of other reasons.

This also means that two factors could push the unemployment rate lower: More people could be getting jobs, or more could have dropped out of the labor force.

We looked at the BLS data for those ""not in the labor force"" and found that between December and January, their ranks appeared to swell by some 1.2 million.

This seems to support Gingrich’s statement, but labor economists say otherwise.

This is why: The BLS bases its unemployment rate on a survey that samples only a portion of the U.S. population. Sometimes, this can cause problems. For instance, the sample might be made up of only 40 percent of women, when they actually make up half the population. Or the sample may contain too great a proportion of Montanans and not enough Floridians.  

BLS economists address this problem by running this data through a series of ""weights."" These are mathematical equations that smooth out quirks in the sample. The weights are based on the makeup of the U.S. population.

The U.S. population changes constantly, so the BLS updates these weights every January.

As a consequence, comparing data between December and January can lead to bad conclusions. Changes are not clear-cut signs of changes in economic conditions. They’re distorted by changes in the weights.  

This is no secret. It’s on the BLS news release. It’s been standard practice for years.

To help policymakers get a handle on what’s actually going on, the BLS issues alternative data that show what the numbers would be if the same population controls stayed the same.

By this measure, the number of people ""not in the workforce"" actually shrank by 75,000, said Barry Hirsch, a professor at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University.

""The [number of people] not in the labor force definitely went down, not up,""  Hirsch said.

There are other signs that the workforce is expanding. Gary Burtless, a labor economist with the Brookings Institution think tank, considered data for adults between 25 and 54. January’s data indicated population control changes did not have as dramatic an effect on this group.

In this category, the number of employed rose 0.3 percentage points in January, reaching a level last seen in the summer of 2009. He believes other groups experienced similar improvements.  

""The favorable unemployment rate change reflected in the 2012 jobs report was mainly the result of increased employment, contrary to Speaker Gingrich’s claim,"" Burtless said in an email.

Gingrich’s claim that ""the biggest contribution"" behind easing unemployment ""was 1.2 million people leaving the workforce"" is based on a bad interpretation of the data that is easy to avoid.

BLS numbers suggest the number of those not in the workforce is actually shrinking. Other measures support this conclusion.

How can the ""biggest contribution"" to a decline in unemployment be a shrinking workforce when the numbers suggest the opposite is taking place?

Gingrich earns a False.

"['Drugs', 'Welfare', 'Florida', 'Paige Kreegel']","
About 800 people refused to get a drug screening because they’re on drugs, said Paige Kreegel
","
Florida leaders are reviving failed efforts to require drug tests of people who get taxpayer money.

The Legislature ordered drug-testing of welfare recipients in 2011, but a federal judge halted the program. Gov. Rick Scott ordered random testing of state employees within his purview, but he suspended the tests in June 2011 after another legal challenge.

Regardless of the lawsuits, state lawmakers are still trying to put drug-testing for state employees into law.

To bolster support of HB 1205, lawmakers discussed on Feb. 15, 2012, the results of their drug-testing initiative for welfare recipients.

During a committee hearing, Rep. Paige Kreegel, R-Punta Gorda, said he read in a newspaper that only 83 people who applied for temporary cash assistance from the state failed the required drug screening. The number is low, he said, but there are hundreds more who are on drugs but were deterred by the drug screening. (Kreegel, by the way, has said he intends to run for the U.S. House of Representatives later this year.)

""In the last line they (newspapers) do admit that there are about 800 and some people who refuse to take the drug test,"" he said, ""which tells me if you add 'em all together there's 1,000 people out there on drugs. Nine out of ten of them are smart enough not to take the drug test.""

He went on to say people would have used the money on drugs ""and now they're not."" 

We were struck by Kreegel’s numbers and assumptions. Is there evidence to back it up?

Kreegel’s reasoning

Kreegel defended his statements when we reached him by phone. ""I think it is a fairly safe assumption that a person would refuse to take a urine drug test because they were afraid of being caught with drugs,"" Kreegel said.

The drug test is the final requirement to receive temporary cash assistance, or TANF as it’s called, after the agency verifies an applicant's income, background, child support and ID.

Applicants pay an average of $35 for the test up front and are reimbursed by the state if they pass.

We're not sure where Kreegel learned that 80 or so people failed the test, or that 800 or so people declined to take it, though he said it was from a newspaper story. We found several stories that measured the requirement’s effectiveness throughout its tenure, but they didn’t use those numbers.

Let’s take it one step at a time.

Who failed the test: Kreegel’s figure of about 80 failed tests is not far from the tally over four months of practice, according to the Department of Children and Families, which administers the TANF program. He actually underestimated it.

Of the 4,086 applicants who scheduled drug tests, 108 people failed their tests, a fail rate of 2.6 percent, according to DCF. About 1 percent of applicants, or 42, scheduled tests but canceled them.

About 96.3 percent of applicants passed the screenings. The high pass rate means the state paid out more than $100,000 in reimbursements to applicants who passed over the four-month period.

Who started their application but didn’t take the test: Kreegel said 800 or so people walked away before taking the drug test. The department reported a number nearly three times as high -- 2,306. 
We asked the department if it had any way to know why people didn’t take the test. 
""There is no way to determine why someone did not take the test,"" said Joe Follick, DCF spokesman. ""We did not have the capacity or legal authority to survey each applicant's decision-making process.""

Other reasons someone might not take a drug test 
The American Civil Liberties Union has sued the state against the drug policy on behalf of Luis Lebron, an Orlando student and a Navy veteran. Derek Newton, an ACLU spokesperson, said there were many reasons people might apply for benefits and then not take the drug tests.

They might not have enough money to pay for the tests up front and wait for state reimbursement. They might find a job in the meantime and not need benefits. They might leave the state for work or for personal reasons. They might qualify for other benefits that make them ineligible for the program. They might be unable to find a nearby testing center.

Lebron refused to comply with the drug-testing requirement, arguing it was an unreasonable search because there wasn’t a reason to assume he was on drugs. The judge who issued the temporary injunction agreed with him, writing in her order, ""The constitutional rights of a class of citizen are at stake.""

In a subsequent discussion of the state-employee drug testing bill, Kreegel repeated the gist of his assumption that applicants did not take the test because they were on drugs.

""People made allusions to the fact that … a very small percentage of people tested positive,"" he said Feb. 21, 2012. ""But the rest of the truth in that story is that about 10 percent of the people who refused a drug test didn’t receive welfare. I personally believe that those would-be welfare recipients were probably not concerned as much about their constitutional rights as they were about the possibility that would test positive. So I think in that case we saved our voters from subsidizing drug abuse.""

Our ruling

Let's review. Kreegel said about 80 people failed a 2011 drug screening requirement to receive welfare, and about 800 more applied for benefits but refused to be screened because they are ""out there on drugs."" One of our principles for fact-checking is that people have to have evidence for what they say. In this case, Kreegel doesn’t have evidence to back up that statement. Meanwhile, drug-testing opponents have offered a number of other reasons why someone might not want take a drug test. And the department that administers the tests can't say why people don't take it. 

Kreegel's numbers are also off. They’re actually higher than he stated, as 108 people failed the test and 2,306 applied for benefits but did not take the test. 

So Kreegel gets the numbers wrong. But more importantly, he makes a blanket statement about people who don't take the test being on drugs, when evidence doesn't exist. We rate his claim False.","[('\n""After dying in the House, Constitutionally-questionable drug-testing requirement revived,"" Miami Herald Naked Politics blog, Feb. 15, 2012\n\n""Governor Rick Scott Commends Legislative Action on Drug Testing, Announces New Staff Drug Testing Policy,"" Gov.

Every day, another 2,700 of us realize it's been six months since we last had a job. Every day, more than 6,000 of us have begun living below poverty, while 13,000 more have been put on food stamps, and more than 800 have become uninsured. … This is the legacy President Obama and his Democrats have left for us. If we give them more time, what else will they do to America?"" 
There’s a lot to digest here, but we’re going to look at two claims from the ad. The one we’re looking at in this item is, ""Since President Obama took full control of Washington … every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost."" 
As we do with claims like this, we split our analysis into two parts. Are the numbers right? And is it fair to assess either credit or blame for those numbers to the target of the ad? 
First, the numbers. 
We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment figures. We first looked at total, nonfarm employment between January 2009, when Obama was sworn in, until December 2011, the most recent month available at the time the ad was released. We also used the figure that would have been available at the time the ad was released. Often BLS adjusts numbers upwards or downwards in the succeeding month, based on additional information. 
Using the preliminary numbers, a net 1,661,000 jobs were lost nationwide. Assuming that three years means 1,095 days -- or 365 times 3 -- then 1,517 net jobs were lost per day during that period. So, using that measurement, the ad is correct. (Using the revised numbers released after the ad came out, the daily number dropped significantly -- to 1,274 -- due to stronger-than-expected job growth.) 
But that’s if you start the count in January 2009. Since Obama was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2009, February was actually his first full month in office -- and using the February numbers makes a big difference. 
Starting with February 2009, the net number of jobs lost was 937,000, which produces a daily job loss of 856, or 43 percent lower than the amount claimed in the ad. (If you look only at private-sector jobs, the daily job loss was even smaller -- 303 jobs, a number that shrunk to just 74 once revised figures appeared.) 
The difference between starting in January or February is so big because the transition between President George W. Bush and Obama included months with some of the most rapid job losses of the entire recession, which began in December 2007. In just the one month from January 2009 to February 2009, for instance, the economy lost a net 725,000 jobs. Even spread over three years, adding just that one extra month to the calculation means adding 660 additional job losses per day. 
Next, does Obama deserve the blame? 
We’ve consistently ruled in the past that the economy is too complex to assign full blame (or credit) for job gains or losses to a president or a governor. 
""Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office.  Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""A recession that is under way or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office."" 
Of special note here is that this ad uses the formulation, ""since President Obama took full control of Washington."" Obama -- or at least the Democrats -- can be said to have had full control of Washington, at least on a nominal basis, for two of those three years. But after the Republicans took over the House beginning in January 2011, they have had a share of the control as well. 
And we can rule out the possibility that the numbers were calculated based on just the two years when Obama had an entirely Democratic Congress, since the NRCC web page linking to the ad states, ""This video shows the daily economic pain endured by American workers and families due to President Obama and Washington Democrats' failed policies averaged over every day of the last three years."" 
Our ruling 
Using the numbers available at the time -- which subsequently have been revised to be more favorable to the president -- and starting the count in January 2009, the ad is correct about the 1,500 jobs lost per day. But starting the count with Obama’s first full month in office, which we think is an equally plausible way of doing it, reduces that number significantly, to 43 percent lower than what the ad claims. Meanwhile, economists tell us that the causes of these job losses are multiple, so it is also incorrect to attribute the blame solely to Obama.  On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False. ","[('\nNational Republican Congressional Committee, ""Every Day of Democrats,"" Jan. 24, 2012', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_profilepage&v=X9b5Z2Y40Vw'), ('\nBureau of Labor Statistics, ""Employment, Hours, and Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey (National),"" accessed Feb. 28, 2012\xa0', 'No link'), ('\nBureau of Labor Statistics, ""Employment Situation News Release,"" Jan. 6, 2012', 'http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?ce'), ('\nBureau of Labor Statistics, ""Employment Situation Summary,"" February 3, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nE-mail interview with Gary Burtless, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, Feb. 28, 2012', 'http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_01062012.htm')]",/factchecks/2012/feb/28/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-ad-says-1500-jobs-lost-daily-barack-obama-too/

Chain email says Dallas ordinance led to towing of many cars belonging to illegal U.S. residents
","
This just in from a chain email: An action by the Dallas City Council led to many local vehicles getting impounded, 80-plus percent of them belonging to illegal immigrants.

Really?

We scoped this out with Dallas authorities, who told us the claim, making the rounds for years on the Internet, reflects a council decision but is not accurate about related impoundments and couldn’t possibly be rooted in solid sources.

More on cars piling up soon, but first, let’s air the email’s particulars, which were passed to us by a reader.

""Has Dallas, Texas Got a Good Idea or What?"" reads the email’s subject line, which concludes with an enthusiastic ""GO Dallas!""  The email itself says a Dallas ordinance passed in 2008 requires that drivers who are pulled over by law enforcement provide proof of insurance. If they can’t do that, the email says, their car is towed -- and proof of insurance is required to retrieve the car.

And, the email continues: ""Shortly after the ""No Insurance"" ordinance was passed, the Dallas impound lots began to fill up and (they) were full after only nine days. 80""-plus percent ""of the impounded cars were driven by illegal’s,"" an indecorous (and ungrammatical) reference to undocumented residents.

The chain email’s claims have been posted at least 50 times since Sept. 2010. We saw it on websites like Sodahead.com, Truthorfiction.com and in myriad online forums. None of the posts offered backup information.

We checked, and found Dallas indeed has such an ordinance. According to an online city summary, the ordinance says that  ""drivers stopped for a traffic violation who cannot show proof of auto insurance meeting state requirements will be issued a citation and will have his or her vehicle towed at the owner’s expense."" However, The Dallas Morning News reported in a Dec. 30, 2008 news article that police officers may use discretion in deciding whether the car will be impounded.

In a telephone interview, Mitchell Rasansky, a former Dallas City Council member and a champion of the 2008 ordinance, said that  he offered the change because ""the people who are really being hurt by (uninsured motorists) are the middle- and lower-income people who get hit, and somebody who hit them doesn’t have insurance.""

Rasanky said he was unaware of how many cars have since been impounded or if affected drivers included many illegal immigrants.

Scott Walton, spokesman for the Dallas Police Department, separately told us: ""If you’ve ever been in an accident and found that the other person is not insured, it really does put a financial burden on you.The city really wants to make sure that anyone traveling through Dallas meets state requirements and don’t get put in that situation.""

Since 1982, it’s been against Texas law to drive without being able to pay for accidents one causes, a requirement most residents meet by having auto insurance, according to John Greeley, a public information officer at the Texas Department of Insurance.

Austin police issue tickets to such drivers, according to Austin Police Department spokeswoman Veneza Aguinaga, but vehicles aren’t impounded.

Cars that are towed by law enforcement are taken to the Dallas Police Department’s auto pound. Walton took issue with the email’s claim that those impound lots were full after nine days. ""It never reached even close to capacity after this was implemented,"" he said.

And has the Dallas ordinance disproportionately affected residents who are in the country illegally?

Walton told us there’s no way to prove the figure the email offers because police officers don’t usually ask whether individuals are citizens in these situations. ""We (also) do not check citizenship or the status of immigration when people come to claim their car,"" he said. ""I don’t know where that (percentage) came from.""

Next, we explored another angle that might help independently evaluate the email:  If illegal immigrants cannot obtain auto insurance, then perhaps they couldn’t be recovering their cars. Greeley of the TDI advised, though, that Texas residents do not have to show they are legally in the country before purchasing vehicle insurance.

Finally, we ran the chain email by Steve Blow, a news columnist for the Dallas Morning News who has written about the city’s impoundment of vehicles.

In his opinion, Blow said, the email has a grain of truth and a lot of fiction.

""I know the line about the impound lot filling up is wrong,"" Blow said in an email. ""That was one of the predictions that never happened. I have no idea where the 80 percent illegals figure comes from. Cops don’t inquire about citizenship. And I have heard nothing about accident rates plunging 47 percent. If that were true, I think police officials would have been eager to make that known.""

Our ruling

Dallas has an ordinance that has led to cars getting impounded. Yet we found no evidence supporting the email’s linchpin claim that about 80 percent of the cars initially impounded belonged to illegal residents. There’s not even a factual way to reach that figure; Dallas authorities don’t usually check the legal residency status of motorists.

We rate this chain email False.","[('\nCity of Dallas ordinance, ordinance no. 27189\n\nDallas Morning News, news article, Uninsured drivers face new law, Dec. 30, 2008\n\nTelephone interview, Mitchell Rasansky, former Dallas City Council member, Feb. 22, 2012\n\nTelephone interviews, Scott Walton, lieutenant of police, media relations unit, Dallas Police Department, February 2012\n\nTelephone interview, Veneza Aguinaga, public information officer, Austin Police Department, Feb. 24, 2012\n\nTelephone interview, John Greeley, public information officer, Texas Department of Insurance, Feb. 22, 2012\n\nEmail exchange, Steve Blow, news columnist at The Dallas Morning News, Feb. 23, 2012', 'http://www.dallascityhall.com/police/pdfs/towing_ordinance.pdf')]",/factchecks/2012/feb/28/chain-email/chain-email-says-dallas-ordinance-led-towing-many-/

Santorum: Supreme Court justice ""prefers"" South African Constitution
","
A political rally drew Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum to First Redeemer Church in Forsyth County, not Sunday services.

So instead of teaching the Bible on Feb. 19, he preached on the U.S. Constitution and what he thinks is an effort by liberals to push it aside.

Santorum’s example was U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is widely considered among the most liberal justices. He asked his audience of 3,000 whether they heard what she said the other day, and they erupted into boos and guffaws.

""So she prefers the South African Constitution over the United States Constitution. A Supreme Court justice says we should be recommending to the world a South African view,"" Santorum told them.

More boos.

Did she really say that?

PolitiFact Florida wrote about a similar accusation by that state’s U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican. He said Ginsburg suggested that some U.S. cases will be decided based on South African law.

PolitiFact Florida found that Rubio was referring to a recent interview she gave on Egyptian television in which she mentioned the South African Constitution. Our Florida counterparts watched it and found that her point didn’t relate to decisions about U.S. cases at all. Rubio earned a False.

Santorum’s claim is somewhat different. He accused Ginsburg of saying that she ""prefers"" the South African Constitution. We reviewed her statement to see whether Santorum was right.

We found she said no such thing.

First, some context.

After a popular uprising and the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, Egypt is in the midst of writing a new constitution. Ginsburg went to Egypt in January to meet with Egyptian judges and legal experts, and while there gave an interview to Al Hayat TV.

Much of the interview, which lasted about 15 minutes, focused on how Ginsburg would advise Egyptians to write their own constitution.

Ginsburg’s lengthy, nuanced responses repeatedly praised the values, concepts and language of the U.S. Constitution and called the people who wrote it ""some of the most brilliant minds of the day ""

Ginsburg warned that a constitution means ""nothing unless the people are yearning for liberty and freedom."" She emphasized the importance of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment and of the separation of powers between Congress, the president and the judiciary that it created.  

Ginsburg also pointed out that a long time had passed between the passage of the U.S. Constitution and Egypt’s current efforts.

""I can’t speak about what the Egyptian experience should be, because I’m operating under a rather old constitution,"" Ginsburg said early in the interview. ""The United States in comparison to Egypt is a very new nation, and yet we have the oldest written constitution still enforced in the world. And it’s a constitution that starts out with three wonderful words: ‘We the people.’ ""

South Africa came up when Al Hayat asked whether Egypt should incorporate parts of other countries’ constitutions in its draft constitution.

""Would your honor’s advice be that a society like ours, with what we call -- what we like to call  -- a transition to the second republic, would your honor’s advice be to get part or use other countries’ constitutions?  

""Maybe the United States or other countries as a model? Or [that] we come up with our own methods and our own draft?"" the interviewer asked.

Ginsburg replied:
   
""You should certainly be aided by all the constitution writing that has gone on since the end of World War II. I would not look to the U.S. Constitution if I were drafting a constitution in the year 2012. I might look at the constitution of South Africa.

""That was a deliberate attempt to have a fundamental instrument of government that embraced basic human rights [and] had an independent judiciary. It really is, I think, a great piece of work that was done.

""Much more recently than the U.S. Constitution is Canada, [which] has a charter of rights and freedoms [and] dates from 1982. You would almost certainly look at the European Convention on Human Rights. … I'm a very strong believer in listening and learning from others.''

At no point during the interview did Ginsburg say that she prefers the South African Constitution to the U.S. one. Her point was that it’s better for Egypt to base its constitution on more recent ones written after Word War II.  

Santorum claimed that Ginsburg said she ""prefers the South African Constitution over the United States Constitution."" She never said that she did.

What Ginsburg did do was give a nuanced opinion of what rights and concepts a good constitution should embody.

Although Ginsburg said that Egypt should draw from newer constitutions, she made a concerted effort to praise key concepts of the U.S. Constitution, such as an independent judiciary and the ideas embodied by the words ""We the people.""   

Santorum’s take on Ginsburg’s comments twisted a handful of words to mean something that they did not. He earns a False.","[('\nYouTube.com, Rick Santorum Rally at First Redeemer Church in Cumming Georgia, Feb. 19, 2012,\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""Santorum brings surging campaign, criticism of Obama, to Georgia,"" Feb. 19, 2012\n\nYouTube, Al Hayat TV interview with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Jan. 30, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, ""Marco Rubio said a U.S. Supreme Court justice suggested that some U.S. cases will be decided based on South African law,"" Feb. 9, 2012', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLKybqj0AUQ')]",/factchecks/2012/feb/28/rick-santorum/santorum-supreme-court-justice-prefers-south-afric/
"['New Jersey', 'Stimulus', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims Obama said unemployment would never top 8 percent if the stimulus was passed
","When Gov. Chris Christie began his interview Sunday on CBS News’ ""Face the Nation,"" host Bob Schieffer said he enjoys having him on the show, because the Republican governor has an unusual habit of answering questions.

But with one of those answers, Christie rehashed an old -- and mostly inaccurate -- GOP talking point about President Barack Obama guaranteeing that the stimulus program would keep unemployment below 8 percent.

With the next round of Republican primaries set for Tuesday in Arizona and Michigan, Christie continued on Sunday making his pitch that GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney would ultimately prevail and take on Obama in the Nov. 6 general election.

Obama will be a very formidable candidate, but the president still has weaknesses, according to Christie.

""He said unemployment was never gonna go over 8 percent if we passed the stimulus plan,"" Christie told Schieffer. ""We went up over 10 percent.""

PolitiFact National and its state affiliates have debunked similar claims several times before, starting with U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) in July 2009. More recently, Romney faced the Truth-O-Meter for repeating that statement earlier this month after winning the Nevada caucuses.

Each time, the claim has received a Mostly False.

Here’s what the fact-checks have revealed:

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the stimulus, was signed into law on Feb. 17, 2009. The stimulus was meant to dole out billions of dollars as a way to boost the economy. The nation’s unemployment rate stood at 8.3 percent in February 2009 and gradually increased before peaking at 10 percent in October 2009, according to seasonally-adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate has since decreased to 8.3 percent as of last month. But PolitiFact has never found evidence of an administration official making a public pledge to hold unemployment below 8 percent. The source of the Republican claims is a Jan. 9, 2009 report from Christina Romer, who would soon become chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, who would serve as chief economist and economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden.

The purpose of the study was to estimate the potential effects of a stimulus program on job creation. Romer and Bernstein estimated that the recovery package would create between 3 million and 4 million jobs by the end of 2010.

On one chart, they estimated the unemployment rates both with and without the stimulus plan.

Without the stimulus, the unemployment rate was projected to top 9 percent in early 2010, the report states. With the stimulus, the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009, according to the report.

But throughout the report, the authors cautioned that their estimates are subject to significant ""uncertainty.""

Check out this passage from the report:

""It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error. There is the obvious uncertainty that comes from modeling a hypothetical package rather than the final legislation passed by the Congress. But, there is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program.

""Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""

So, the claim about unemployment not exceeding 8 percent was a projection subject to ""uncertainty,"" and far from the guarantee suggested by Christie and other Republicans. The governor's office did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Our ruling

During his ""Face the Nation"" interview, Christie repeated the GOP talking point that Obama ""said unemployment was never gonna go over 8 percent if we passed the stimulus plan.""

As PolitiFact has determined numerous times before, neither Obama personally nor his administration never made such a promise. Two economic advisers offered that projection, but stressed repeatedly that their estimates were subject to considerable ""uncertainty."" Although Christie's statement represents a gross exaggeration, it contains an element of truth. That's why this claim is rated Mostly False.

Rick Santorum calls Barack Obama a 'snob' for wanting 'everybody in America to go to college'
","
Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum kicked up a media storm when he slammed President Barack Obama as a ""snob"" at an Americans for Prosperity forum in Troy, Mich., on Feb. 25, 2012. 
""President Obama once said he wants everybody in America to go to college,"" Santorum said. ""What a snob. There are good, decent men and women who go out and work hard every day and put their skills to test that aren't taught by some liberal college professor that (tries) to indoctrinate them."" 
The issue received such attention that Obama on Feb. 27 addressed the issue obliquely, telling the National Governors Association that ""the jobs of the future are increasingly going to those with more than a high school degree. And I have to make a point here. When I speak about higher education, we’re not just talking about a four-year degree. We’re talking about somebody going to a community college and getting trained for that manufacturing job that now is requiring somebody walking through the door, handling a million-dollar piece of equipment.  And they can’t go in there unless they’ve got some basic training beyond what they received in high school. We all want Americans getting those jobs of the future. So we’re going to have to make sure that they’re getting the education that they need."" 
Obama has made no secret that he encourages Americans to go to college and has pursued policies to expand access to those who want to go. 
But we received a number of requests from readers to see whether Obama went so far as to say that he ""wants everybody in America to go to college."" We didn’t hear back from the Santorum campaign, but we looked into Obama’s past speeches, using both Nexis and the White House website, to locate instances in which he broached the topic. 
We found 18 examples. All but three of them make clear that Obama does not expect every young American to attend a traditional four-year, bachelors-degree-granting college or university or even a community college. In three cases, Obama did say something closer to what Santorum suggested, but still not enough to justify Santorum's claim. 
In seven sets of remarks, Obama focused not on having every young American attend college, but rather making college a possibility for every American who wants to attend, particularly making it more affordable. Here are two that were typical (the full list is available here). 
• A letter by Barack Obama to his daughters, published in Parade magazine, Jan. 2009. ""In the end, girls, that's why I ran for President: because of what I want for you and for every child in this nation. I want all our children to go to schools worthy of their potential—schools that challenge them, inspire them, and instill in them a sense of wonder about the world around them. I want them to have the chance to go to college—even if their parents aren't rich."" 
• Remarks at the Biltmore Hotel, Coral Gables, Fla., Feb. 23, 2012. ""When kids graduate, I want them to be able to afford to go to college. If they've been working hard, if they've gotten the grades to go to college, I don't want them to cut their dreams short because they don't think they can afford it."" 
In another four speeches, Obama focused on community colleges as an alternative to the traditional, four-year college experience. Here is one example: 
• Remarks at a Democratic issues conference, Jan. 27, 2012. ""They don't all have to go to four-year colleges and universities -- although we need more engineers and we need more scientists, and we've got to make sure that college is affordable and accessible. But we also need skilled workers who are going to community colleges, or middle-aged workers who are allowed to retrain, have a commitment to work, have that work ethic, but want to make sure that technology is not passing them by -- and so focusing on our community colleges, and making sure that they're matched up with businesses that are hiring right now, and making sure that they help to design the programs that are going to put them -- put people in place to get those jobs right away."" 
In another four speeches, Obama was quite explicit about encouraging Americans to pursue either a college education or vocational training, apprenticeships or lifelong retraining. What he said in his first address to a joint session of Congress was typical: 
• Address to a Joint Session of Congress, Feb. 24, 2009. ""Tonight, I ask every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training. This can be community college or a four-year school; vocational training or an apprenticeship. But whatever the training may be, every American will need to get more than a high school diploma."" 
Judging by these 15 speeches, it’s possible to conclude that Obama favors giving all Americans the chance to get a university education if they wish, and opening up other opportunities for education beyond high school for those who do not, from community colleges to vocational training to apprenticeships. 
Finally, in three speeches Obama said something a little closer to what Santorum claimed he said. 
For instance, in remarks at a Democratic National committee fundraiser in Austin, Texas, on May 10, 2011, he said: ""Our reforms are not done. I want every child in Texas and every child in America ready to graduate, ready to go to college, and actually able to afford going to college. That's how we're going to out-compete and out-educate the rest of the world. That's how America will succeed in the 21st century."" 
Meanwhile, at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee dinner in Minneapolis, Minn., on Oct. 23, 2010, Obama said, ""We've got to make sure that every young person in America is prepared for college and then can afford to go to college."" And at a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee dinner in Rockville, Md., on Oct. 18, 2010, Obama said, ""How do we make sure that every young person can go to college once they get through that high school?"" 
Our ruling 
Santorum claimed that Obama ""once said he wants everybody in America to go to college."" We found 18 statements from Obama about people attending college. In the vast majority of the 18, Obama talked about making college a possibility or included the option of attending community colleges or vocational training instead. We found three that offered partial support for Santorum's claim, but their tenor was mainly about opening doors for people who want to go to college, not a clear desire that everyone enroll. We rate the claim False.

Rick Santorum says, 'Amniocentesis does, in fact, result more often than not ... in abortion'
","
Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum opposes requiring insurers to pay for a type of invasive prenatal testing called amniocentesis, saying it results ""more often than not in this country in abortion.""

The test, which doctors offer as an option to pregnant women, uses a long needle to remove a small amount of fluid from the sac that surrounds a fetus. While the test carries a less than 1 percent risk of miscarriage, it can be used to diagnose gene and chromosomal disorders, neural tube defects, blood disorders and infections.

Santorum told Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer that it’s used to ""recommend abortion.""

""Amniocentesis does, in fact, result more often than not in this country in abortion,"" he explained during the CBS News interview on Feb. 19, 2012.

We wondered, does the diagnostic test ""result more often than not in this country in abortion""?

We reached out to government agencies, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Guttmacher Institute, the March of Dimes and the Christian Medical & Dental Associations.

There’s no national source any of these groups knew of that tracks amniocentesis procedures and their outcomes. But there’s good evidence Santorum overstated his case.

The interview

In Santorum’s Face the Nation interview, host Schieffer referred to a comment Santorum had made on the campaign trail in Columbus, Ohio. Schieffer said, ""You sound like you're saying that the purpose of prenatal care is to cause people to have abortions, to get more abortions in this country. … Any number of people would say that's not the purpose at all.""

Santorum responded, ""Well, Bob, that's simply not true. The bottom line is that a lot of prenatal tests are done to identify deformities in utero, and the customary procedure is to encourage abortions. … You said prenatal care. I didn't say prenatal care shouldn't be covered. We're talking about specifically prenatal testing, and specifically amniocentesis, which is a procedure that actually creates a risk of having a miscarriage when you have it and is done for the purposes of identifying maladies of a child in the womb. In many cases, and in fact most cases physicians recommend, particularly if there's a problem, recommend abortion. We know, Bob, that 90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted.""

After mentioning his daughter Bella’s diagnosis with the serious chromosomal disorder Trisomy 18, Santorum added: ""We had a sonogram done there and they detected a problem. And yes, the doctor said, you know, you should consider an abortion.

""This is typical, Bob, this is what goes on in medical rooms around the country. And yes, prenatal testing, amniocentesis, does, in fact, result more often than not in this country in abortion. That is a fact.""

Separately, we checked Santorum’s statement from the same interview that ""90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted."" (We found that Half True — some regional studies bear him out, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it’s difficult to generalize for the entire nation.)

Here, we’re focusing on his statement, ""Amniocentesis, does, in fact, result more often than not in this country in abortion.""

The data

We asked Santorum’s campaign for support for his claim, but didn’t hear back.

We would have appreciated some guidance, because as we mentioned, no government agency or major professional group we found tracks amniocentesis and parents’ choices afterward. We checked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, who referred us to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

""Our scientific staff notes that there is no national source that tracks amniocentesis procedures, and the NIH does not have any information on the proportion of cases in which amniocentesis is performed and which subsequently end in pregnancy termination,"" Robert Bock of the National Institute of Child Health & Human Development told us.

The Guttmacher Institute, which does research on sexual and reproductive health, including abortion, doesn’t keep data on parents’ choices after amniocentesis. Neither does the March of Dimes, which offers information about genetic disorders and birth defects.

That left the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a professional group with 52,000 members. It doesn’t collect data on amniocentesis procedures, either.

But a spokesman did refer us to an expert in prenatal diagnosis.

The researchers

That means checking this claim comes down to individual studies and researchers who study parents’ responses to prenatal diagnosis.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggested we speak with Mark Evans, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. He’s also president of the Fetal Medicine Foundation of America, president of the International Fetal Medicine and Surgery Society Foundation and past president of the Central Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

He noted something that other experts we talked with also quickly pointed out: More than 90 percent of the time, the results of amniocentesis are normal, and parents go on to have healthy children.

So, based on that, Santorum is incorrect.

Meanwhile, when doctors do find a problem, only about half of patients choose to end their pregnancies, Evans said — and there’s a direct relationship between the severity of the problem and parents’ choice.

There’s also a direct relationship between the region parents live in and the choices they make — something we pointed out in our rating about Down syndrome.

""In liberal areas such as New York, probably 80 to 90 percent of parents with severe abnormalities do choose to terminate when legal to do so. In conservative areas, the proportion of termination is much lower — perhaps as little as 10 percent,"" Evans said. 
So Santorum might have been right if he had focused only on amniocentesis that results in diagnosis of a severe abnormality in liberal regions of the U.S. But his statement was much broader.

Evans argues, in fact, that prenatal diagnosis allows for more healthy babies, both because accurate diagnoses help doctors treat fetuses with problems (he’s helped pioneer such in utero procedures as a stem-cell transplant for a fetus with a severely compromised immune system), and because accurate testing helps parents at high risk for passing on serious genetic abnormalities to confidently continue their pregnancies.

""These are women who would not have otherwise gotten pregnant,"" he said.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists points out that in the case of a definitive diagnosis of a chromosomal abnormality, such as Down syndrome, the doctor and family have information to plan ahead for the rest of the pregnancy, labor and delivery.

(That’s something former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who chose to have an amniocentesis, has said she was grateful for before the birth of her son, Trig.)

Meanwhile, experts we spoke with disagree with Santorum that doctors ""encourage"" abortions.

Prenatal diagnosis itself is an optional procedure, pointed out Miriam Kupperman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and epidemiology at University of California at San Francisco. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists merely recommends that testing be offered as an option to every pregnant woman.

Invasive procedures, such as amniocentesis, are typically only conducted after screening such as a blood test shows a fetus is at higher risk. After diagnosis of an abnormality, abortion would be presented among a parent’s options, along with any possible treatment.

Gene Rudd, an obstetrician/gynecologist and senior vice president of the Christian Medical & Dental Associations, said that day-to-day reality doesn’t always bear out such even-handed counseling — either before patients choose invasive procedures such as amniocentesis or afterward.

""I just don't think they are being properly informed,"" he said. ""It's just so routine that when patients these days are given the option of giving the blood test, it's almost like it's not presented as an option. … Once that test is positive, the knee-jerk reaction is, you need an amniocentesis.""

Like Santorum, Rudd said he’s concerned about mandating free coverage for amniocentesis because of its small risk of miscarriage and the fact that parents may choose to end their pregnancies based on a diagnosis.

Still, the test can provide useful information in some cases when parents want to keep their pregnancies, he said.

""There are a few conditions where the prenatal diagnosis can be important,"" he said. ""There are some preparatory things that make good sense. People can rationally choose to have amniocentesis for that. … I think that's admirable when people want to choose to do that.""

Our ruling

Santorum told Face the Nation, ""Amniocentesis does, in fact, result more often than not in this country in abortion."" While no agency or organization we spoke with keeps national statistics, researchers and reports we consulted show that more than 90 percent of amniocenteses result in normal diagnoses — and thus often healthy babies. Meanwhile, perhaps half of parents whose fetuses are diagnosed with abnormalities —  mostly those with the most severe, untreatable problems — may go on to end their pregnancies. So by the best evidence available, perhaps less than 5 percent of parents who choose amniocentesis choose to end their pregnancies. Santorum’s statement isn’t accurate, and we rate it False.","[('\nCBS News, ""Santorum stands by prenatal screening opposition,"" Feb. 19, 2012 (Video: Comments start at 3:00)\n\nCQ Newsmaker Transcripts, ""Bob Schieffer Hosts CBS’s ‘Face the Nation,’"" Feb. 19, 2012 (subscription only)\n\nRick Santorum, ""Meet our daughter Bella,"" accessed Feb. 27, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, ""Rick Santorum says \'90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted,\'"" Feb. 22, 2012\n\nMedlinePlus, U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, ""Amniocentesis,"" Sept. 13, 2011\n\nMedlinePlus, U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, ""Trisomy 18,"" Aug. 4, 2011\n\nInterview with Greg Phillips, director of media relations, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Feb. 22, 2011\n\nInterview with Mark Evans, professor of obstetrics and gynecology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Feb. 23, 2012\n\nInterview with Miriam Kuppermann, professor of obstetrics, gynecology and epidemiology, director, program in clinical perinatal and comparative effectiveness research, University of California at San Francisco, Feb. 22, 2012\n\nInterview with Kurt Hirschhorn, professor emeritus of pediatrics, genetics and medicine, Division of Medical Genetics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Feb. 21, 2012\n\nInterview with Laird Jackson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology and medical genetics, Center for Molecular Diagnostics and Genome Research, Drexel University College of Medicine, Feb. 21, 2012\n\nInterview with Gene Rudd, obstetrician/gynecologist, senior vice president, Christian Medical & Dental Associations, Feb. 22, 2012\n\nInterview with Michele Kling, director, national media relations, March of Dimes, Feb. 21-22, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Robert Bock, writer-editor, public information and communications, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development, Feb. 21, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Elizabeth Neilson, senior communications adviser, Office of Disease Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Feb. 21, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Renate Myles, senior press officer, National Institutes of Health, Feb. 21, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Karen Hunter, senior press officer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention media relations, Feb. 21, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Rebecca Wind, senior communications associate, Guttmacher Institute, Feb. 21, 2012\n\nChristian Post, ""Ob-Gyn: Santorum Was Right, Prenatal Testing Used to Abort Disabled,"" Feb. 22, 2012\n\nGenetic Counseling Program at the University of South Carolina, ""Toward Concurrence: Understanding Prenatal Screening and Diagnosis of Down Syndrome from the Health Professional and Advocacy Community Perspectives,"" June 17, 2009\n\nObstetrics and Gynecology, ""ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 77: screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities,"" January 2007\n\nObstetrics and Gynecology, ""ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 88, December 2007.

Mitt Romney says Obama gave away car companies to union
","
With just one day to go before the Michigan primary, Mitt Romney is firing lots of criticism at the 2009 auto industry bailouts.

Romney accuses President Barack Obama of mismanagement when GM and Chrysler were on the verge of collapse in late 2008 and early 2009.

He says the car manufacturers should have been allowed to go bankrupt and that Obama practiced ""crony capitalism"" in negotiating with union bosses. And in a CNN debate on Feb. 22, 2012, Romney said, ""the president gave the companies to the UAW.""

Here, we’ll take a look at that last claim.

The bailouts

In late 2008, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors were mired in crisis. The companies needed immediate cash, or they faced collapse.

President George W. Bush authorized initial loans to Chrysler and GM (Ford declined) before leaving office. Then the problem ended up in the new president’s lap.

The Obama administration extended billions more in loans and led a restructuring of the two companies in which the government took an equity share in GM and Chrysler.

Critics, including Romney, said the auto makers should have gone through the normal bankruptcy process.

""A managed bankruptcy may be the only path to the fundamental restructuring the industry needs. It would permit the companies to shed excess labor, pension and real estate costs,"" he wrote in a November 2008 op-ed in the New York Times.

But others pointed out that, with the credit markets frozen and the wider economy in dire straits, the car companies wouldn’t get private financing and would go out of business.

During the process, the United Auto Workers, the union representing car company employees and retirees, made concessions to help the companies stop bleeding. We consulted several sources for an explanation on what each side gave.

In sum, the union eased demands on wages, overtime pay, job security and, most significantly, health benefits. In 2007, the union and car companies had agreed to hand over management of retiree health benefits to a trust fund. The companies agreed to put money in the fund, and the union assumed the uncertainties of rising health care costs and investment fluctuations.

But in 2009, the car companies were on the brink and had no cash to put in the fund. The alternative contribution: company stock.

That’s how an independent health care trust for UAW beneficiaries ended up owning Chrysler and GM stock. As of February 2012, the trust holds a 41.5 percent stake in Chrysler and a 10.3 percent stake in General Motors.

A bit about the politics

Obama was accused of structuring a deal that gave more to the union -- a heavy backer of Democrats in both votes and campaign money -- than a bankruptcy judge would have done.

""Unquestionably, the Obama administration gave its political allies in the United Auto Workers a better deal than the union would have gotten from a private-equity firm or a Republican president,"" Charles Lane wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Post. ""UAW workers accepted layoffs and lower wages for future hires -- but no current wage reduction, like those accepted by workers in many other distressed industries.""

On the other hand, UAW President Bob King estimated that each union member has sacrificed $7,000 to $30,000 in annual compensation, either in pay or benefits, since 2005, according to a story in the New York Times.

To Romney, who also wrote an op-ed piece on this subject, the deal amounted to ""crony capitalism on a grand scale."" His campaign did not respond to a request for comment on this story.

Analyzing the statement

Here’s one important point: The stock is owned by an independent health care trust called the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust, not the UAW itself. (The trust is also often referred to by the acronym VEBA.)

A 2011 letter to its 840,000 beneficiaries said the trust is ""a separate entity, independent of the auto companies and the UAW. The trust has its own assets. The assets in the trust are not the property of the auto companies or the UAW. Instead, those assets are held in the trust on behalf of the covered retirees. Those assets can only be used to provide medical benefits to UAW retirees and their families. Neither the UAW nor the auto companies can use those assets for any other purpose.""

The letter further explains that the UAW appoints five of the 11 members -- a minority -- to the trust’s board.

Next, we talked to a couple of industry analysts for their take on Romney’s statement, again, that Obama ""gave the (auto) companies to the union.""

""Giveaway is not the right word because the unions gave up cash payments. They took on some risk,"" said Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman of edmunds.com, a consumer-oriented automotive website. ""For the union there was no guarantee.""

Steve Rattner, who served as Obama’s ""car czar"" told us in an email, ""the ownership wasn't ‘given’ to the VEBA; the VEBA received it in return for giving up very large claims it held against the company.""

Kristin Dziczek with the Center for Automotive Research, added that the union members were also creditors in this situation because the car companies were contractually obligated to pay for their health benefits.

""The retiree health care trust was owed billions of dollars,"" she said.

And since the car companies didn’t have the billions on hand, they chipped in equity instead. In the case of GM, the stock could be sold at any time, Dziczek said. But since Chrysler is not a publicly traded company, the UAW health trust is stuck with it for now.

Rattner added that the stocks didn’t come with voting rights.

So did Obama give the car companies to the union?

Said Dziczek: ""The majority stakeholder in Chrysler is Fiat. (The health care trust) is not the majority stakeholder in GM. They don’t have a voting seat as a result of this. They don’t have a vote on the board. They’re not managing the company.""

""Who is running these companies? Not the UAW.""

Our ruling

Romney, in the debate, said ""the president gave the (auto) companies to the UAW.""

The reality is Obama was in charge of a bailout deal that resulted in the union’s health care trust owning stock in Chrysler and GM. But the trust was owed money to pay for health care under the terms of labor contracts the car companies signed. And the union ""gave"" plenty too -- in the form of wages, vacation and job security. In that light, the arrangement was a tradeoff, not a giveaway.

What tips Romney’s claim even further from reality is the fact that the union itself does not own any GM or Chrysler stock. The trust that manages health benefits for retirees is the stockholder, and it is independent from the UAW. It is not a majority shareholder in either company, nor does it have a vote on the board.

All the experts we talked to agreed that Romney’s statement is just flat wrong. Our ruling: False.","[('\nInterview with Kristin Dziczek, director of the Labor and Industry Group at the Center for Automotive Research, Feb. 24, 2012\n\nInterview with Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman of edmunds.com, Feb. 24, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Steve Rattner, former Obama administration official, Feb. 24, 2012\n\nUAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust, letter to beneficiaries, December 2011\n\nNew York Times, ""Let Detroit Go Bankrupt,"" by Mitt Romney, Nov. 19, 2008, accessed via Nexis\n\nThe New Republic, ""Romney’s Latest Attempt to Spin the GM Bailout,"" Feb. 14, 2012\n\nHuffington Post, ""Romney Doubles Down Against Auto Bailout and UAW Amid Automakers\' Record Success,"" Feb. 16, 2012\n\nNew York Times, ""Auto Rebound Pays Dividend To Work Force,"" Jan. 13, 2011, accessed via Nexis\n\nWashington Post, ""Automaker bailout has costs and benefits for Romney, Santorum, Obama,"" Feb. 20., 2012\n\nDetroit News, ""Romney op-ed: U.S. autos bailout \'was crony capitalism on a grand scale,\'"" Feb. 14, 2012\n\nWall Street Journal, ""Majority of GM Bondholders Back Debt-for-Equity Deal,"" May 31, 2009\n\nWall Street Journal, ""New Era in Autos as GM Set for Bankruptcy,"" June 1, 2009', 'http://stevenrattner.com/')]",/factchecks/2012/feb/27/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obama-gave-away-car-companies-uni/

Florida ranks 45th in the nation for tuition costs, Denise Grimsley says
","
After the budget committee in the Florida House recommended an 8 percent tuition increase last month, parents, students and politicians alike cried foul because the state university system has raised tuition for the past six years.

Even Gov. Rick Scott, who signed a budget last year with a tuition increase with nary a peep, said, ""I don't believe in tuition hikes.""

The problem with getting upset about those higher tuition bills, said House budget panel chair Rep. Denise Grimsley, R-Sebring, is that Floridians aren't really paying all that much for college as it is because Florida’s tuition rates are already among the lowest in the nation.

""The cost of postsecondary education in Florida is almost the lowest in the nation at an average of $5,531 (Florida ranks 45th), which is 32 percent lower than the national average of $8,200,"" Grimsley told the Tampa Bay Times. ""The increase is equal to $8.27 per credit hour, which equates to $248.10 for a full 30 credit hours per year. Allowing tuition increases helps keeps Florida nationally competitive.""  

This oft-cited ranking of 45th is a very popular argument among proponents of the increase, in Tallahassee and across the state's 11 public universities. PolitiFact wondered, since this ranking is quoted so often, is it accurate?

The source of the national rankings is the College Board’s 2011 Trends in College Pricing report. The annual report is produced by the nonprofit organization, which also owns the SAT, and is comprised of data from surveys of almost 4,000 postsecondary institutions nationwide and historical data from the National Center for Education Statistics and the U.S. Department of Education. In this case, we're talking about the average price paid by a full-time student for one year of undergraduate enrollment. (It does not include room and board.)

For the 2011-12 academic year, this amounted to an average of $5,626, the survey says. This is an 11.8 percent increase from the previous year, when the average was $5,034. The discrepancy between Grimsley's numbers and the final reported $5,626 is a difference between weighted and unweighted data, said College Board analyst Jennifer Ma. The simple average across tuitions is $5,531, but the board uses a formula to create totals that better reflect full-time enrollment, she said.

Last year, the Legislature increased tuition 8 percent, and the state university system followed up with another 7 percent hike under a program known as tuition differential. Universities are allowed to raise tuition beyond any legislative base tuition hike as long as the total increase does not exceed 15 percent each year. They’re allowed to keep going up until reaching the national average, which currently stands at $8,244.  (Last year’s 15 percent increase differs from the 11.8 percent listed in the Trends in College Pricing report because the report includes fees as well as tuition.)

As any parent with a checkbook can see, Florida's average tuition is cheaper than $8,244. It's also cheaper than the state with the highest average tuition in the country, an honor that belongs to New Hampshire, which stands at $13,507. The last school on the list is Wyoming, which charges an average of $4,125.

In addition to Wyoming, the other states costing less than Florida are West Virginia, New Mexico, Alaska, Utah and Louisiana. 
If your eyes haven't glazed over from so many numbers, the important part is that of all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Florida does indeed rank 45th, although if we want to get technical, which PolitiFact always does, Florida is ranked 44th among the 50 states when you exclude D.C. (which comes in at No. 31 on the list with an even $7,000).  
In case you were wondering, the wide variance among state tuition costs comes down to taxpayer-funded support for postsecondary education. In states with very high average tuition, tax coffers contribute very little to public colleges and universities. Florida's tax contribution to tuition costs has dropped significantly in recent years; tuition used to pay about 25 percent of the cost of college, with state support picking up 75 percent of the bill. That ratio has moved closer to a 50-50 model.

Ralph Wilcox, provost at the University of South Florida and chairman of the Council of Academic Vice Presidents for the state university system, prefers to compare Florida to other states with high-ranked public research universities recognized by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, using data from the U.S Department of Education. In that scenario, Florida ranks dead last for tuition costs. The average among those 40 states now tops $9,200.

Grimsley's office defends continued increases in order to bring Florida schools in line with other research universities and to fund new initiatives. The rise in prices would also help schools recruit highly qualified faculty and researchers, she reasons.

Our ruling

For this fact-check, we're not looking at the case for or against college tuition increases. Instead, we wanted to see if Florida actually came in 45th in the nation for tuition costs, because we've heard that number cited so often. Using the most comprehensive survey of postsecondary education available, Florida does indeed rank 45th if you count the District of Columbia; otherwise, the state ranks 44th. The only states that have lower tuition than we do are West Virginia, New Mexico, Alaska, Utah, Louisiana and Wyoming. We rate this claim True.","[('\nTampa Bay Times, ""Gov.

Joe Biden called for limits on fracking, not a ban
","Paul Junge — one of several Republican candidates looking to unseat U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Holly — touts fracking as a boon to Michigan’s economy and is attacking Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden for his stance on the energy extraction method.  On his campaign website, Junge claims ""moderate Democrats like Joe Biden have endorsed a ban on fracking, which would eliminate 516,000 Michigan jobs and reduce the state’s gross domestic product by $159 billion over five years."" Hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" is a method of releasing oil and gas from shale rock underground by injecting water, sand and chemicals. It has provided an economic boost for some areas of the Midwest, but environmental officials and advocates are concerned about its impact on local water supplies, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Michigan, home to the large Antrim Shale formation, has not seen significant uptake of fracking activity. Voters may have a chance to decide whether it can continue at all if advocates of a fracking ban succeed in reviving a proposed ballot initiative. Polls suggest voters are divided on the issue.  Many Democrats have been critical of fracking on environmental grounds and call for a shift away from fossil fuels, but Junge, a former TV news anchor, exaggerates both Biden’s position on fracking and the impact banning fracking would have on Michigan’s economy. While Biden has called for a ban on new permits for fracking on federal land and waters, he has not supported a ban on fracking on private or state land. As evidence for the claim, Junge’s campaign provided the transcript of a March 2020 Democratic debate in which Biden said ""no new fracking,"" and then added, ""no more drilling on federal lands.""  Following the debate, a Biden campaign spokesperson clarified that Biden wants a ban only on new fracking activities on federal lands and waters. PolitiFact rated a Facebook claim that Biden ""announced on CNN he will completely shut down drilling for oil and natural gas on day one of his administration"" as Mostly False.  The Junge campaign said that a ban on fracking would eliminate 516,000 Michigan jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that only 1,577 workers in Michigan were employed in natural-gas extraction, oil and gas drilling, and related support activities in 2019.  David Foster, a former Energy Department official and distinguished associate at the Washington-based Energy Futures Initiative, notes that the data does not differentiate between fracking and conventional oil and gas production.  A supplemental survey conducted for a report on energy employment in the U.S. that Foster wrote found an additional 1,600 people involved in natural-gas fuels in Michigan. This includes professional services jobs, such as accountants, primarily servicing the oil and gas activities identified by the Bureau of Labor Statistics data.  Taken together, the oil and natural-gas sector employs fewer than 3,200 workers in Michigan.  While fracking may not employ many workers in the state, home heating needs and energy-intensive manufacturing in Michigan make the state’s economy sensitive to changes in the energy market. Still, it is unlikely a ban on fracking would cost the state’s economy more than 500,000 jobs and billions of dollars in economic activity over the next five years.  The job- and GDP-loss estimates cited by Junge come from a report by the Global Energy Institute at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington.  The institute uses an economic-impact analysis model to measure how employment and economic activity statewide would change as a result of a ban on fracking. The analysis makes several assumptions to arrive at the job and GDP figures.  First, it assumes that a ban on fracking would result in higher energy prices for consumers and businesses, forcing them to spend more on energy and less on other items such as household goods or investment. Second, it assumes there won’t be any major structural shift in the U.S. energy market over the next five years except for this increase in energy prices. Third, it assumes the higher prices would create some ""windfall"" effect for select producers, boosting some households’ income and spending power.  But researchers are skeptical of using such a model to analyze the potential macroeconomic impact of a fracking ban on a state’s economy.  Tim Bartik, senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, believes the institute’s analysis makes unrealistic assumptions that overstate the impact of a ban on fracking.  The method assumes that neither consumers nor businesses would adapt to any price increases. As Bartik explains, this would mean that ""no one adjusts to the banning of fracking, except that prices go up to allocate the reduced supply of energy, the extra funds spent on energy then apparently disappear to Mars, and this reduction in income, in turn, reduces demand mechanically for all other goods and services."" The authors of the institute report said the economy eventually would adjust to higher prices, but evidence of that adjustment would not appear until several years after a ban.  By then, they predict, the U.S. economy would tank, suffering more than a 10% reduction to employment and economic output with the loss of 19 million jobs and $7.1 trillion in GDP. Michigan alone would take a five-year hit to its GDP that amounts to a third of its 2019 economic output, they estimate.  These are ""some incredible numbers,"" Bartik said. Junge said, ""Even so-called moderate Democrats like Joe Biden have endorsed a ban on fracking, which would eliminate 516,000 Michigan jobs and reduce the state’s gross domestic product by $159 billion over five years."" Biden miscommunicated his stance in a debate, but the campaign clarified his position, which the Junge campaign is distorting. Biden supports a ban on new fracking on federal lands and waters, not a total ban.  Meanwhile, the job and GDP loss projections Junge cites come from an analysis that researchers say overstates the impact of a ban on fracking.  The campaign did not respond to a request for further comment.  We rate this statement Mostly False. ","[('Paul Junge for Congress, ""Issues - America First Energy & Environment""', 'https://pauljunge.com/issues/'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation and The Cook Political Report, ""Blue Wall Voices Project,"" November 2019', 'No link'), ('Committee to Ban Fracking in Michigan, ""Committee to Ban Fracking in Michigan Files Suit in Michigan Supreme Court to Get on 2020 Ballot,"" June 10, 2020', 'http://files.kff.org/attachment/REPORT-Blue-Wall-Voices-Project'), ('CNN, ""CNN Democratic Presidential Primary Debate Transcript,"" March 15, 2020', 'No link'), ('Wall Street Journal, ""Biden Aims for Tricky Balance on Fracking,"" March 16, 2020', 'https://www.letsbanfracking.org/press_release_june_10_2020'), ('PolitiFact, ""In debate, Joe Biden said no more oil drilling and no new fracking, didn’t say shutdowns,"" March 20, 2020', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, ""Fact-checking the Biden fracking fracas,"" March 19, 2020', 'http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2003/15/se.03.html'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, Private, NAICS 6-Digit Industries, Michigan 2019 Annual Averages, All Establishment Sizes\xa0', 'No link'), ('Energy Futures Initiative and the National Association of State Energy Officials, ""2020 U.S. Energy & Employment Report""', 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-aims-for-tricky-balance-on-fracking-11584396925'), ('Biden for President, ""Joe’s Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice""', 'No link'), ('David Foster, Distinguished Associate at the Energy Futures Initiative, phone interview, June 11, 2020', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/20/facebook-posts/debate-joe-biden-said-no-more-oil-drilling-and-no-/'), ('Global Energy Institute at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ""What If...

Milwaukee was among first to declare racism a public health crisis
","The death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police has once again brought the issue of racism to the forefront of global discussion. In Milwaukee, as in other cities across Wisconsin and the nation, protesters have called for an end to police brutality and discrimination.  In a June 14, 2020 interview on WISN-TV’s ‘UPFRONT’ with Adrienne Pedersen, Milwaukee health commissioner Jeanette Kowalik commented on some things the city has done to address racism. When she did, she included this tidbit that might have surprised some viewers: ""Our health department, our city and our county declared racism as a public health crisis last year.""  Let’s take a closer look. When asked to back up her claim, Kowalik pointed to a Common Council resolution adopted July 30, 2019 that says ""racism is a public health crisis affecting the entire society."" The resolution commits the city to take action toward ""achieving racial equity"" and suggests efforts to ""address public health disparities due to racial inequities."" It was signed Aug. 8, 2019 by Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. The resolution notes that, at the time, the Wisconsin Public Health Association, as well as 24 cities, counties and states in the U.S., had declared racism to be a public health crisis.  A May 28, 2019 CBS News report says Milwaukee was the first city in the United States to declare racism a public health crisis. But that report likely meant to refer to Milwaukee County, which passed its declaration of racism as a public health crisis on May 20, 2019.   At the time, then-Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele said the resolution was about making a public commitment to taking action. He said every decision across the county should be framed in terms of how to make a difference addressing disparities. That covers the city and the county. As for the Health Department, Kowalik cited a May 16, 2019 letter she sent to the Common Council that described racism as a public health crisis.  Dr. David Pate, chair of the school of social work at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, called the declaration ""very significant,"" particularly for Milwaukee, which has repeatedly been cited as one of the most segregated metro areas in the U.S. Pate said one of the main ideas of looking at racism as a public health issue was to first look at ""improving access to health"" by categories like race and gender. He noted that Milwaukee has one of the highest Black mortality rates in the country.  White people live an average of 14 years longer than Black people in the city, according to a ProPublica article. And these disparities begin at birth.  The Black infant mortality rate in Milwaukee was 18.4 deaths per 1,000 births in 2017. The U.S. infant mortality rate for white babies is 4.95 and 11.1 for Black babies. Pate told PolitiFact Wisconsin that Floyd’s death has people aware of ""the idea that there are some issues that we have not dealt with that are systemic."" The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted some of these disparities — the virus has disproportionately impacted Black populations. On June 8, 2020, in the wake of the Floyd protests, the Denver city council declared racism a public health crisis. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh made the same decision four days later.  The list goes on, as more cities follow the lead of Milwaukee County and the city of Milwaukee. Kowalik said ""Our health department, our city and our county declared racism as a public health crisis last year."" All three bodies did make such a declaration, putting them at the forefront of something that has picked up steam nationwide in the months since. We rate this claim True. ","[(""WISN-TV, 'UPFRONT' recap: Wisconsin lawmakers debate Justice in Policing Act, June 14, 2020"", 'https://www.wisn.com/article/upfront-recap-wisconsin-lawmakers-debate-justice-in-policing-act/32858861'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, MKE County Exec signs resolution, May 20, 2019', 'No link'), ('CBS News, MKE first to declare racism crisis, May 28, 2019', 'https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2019/05/20/abele-signs-resolution-declaring-racism-public-health-crisis/3741809002/'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, MKE most segregated city, Jan. 8, 2019', 'No link'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Black infants die at a high rate in Milwaukee, May 9, 2019', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/video/milwaukee-wisconsin-declares-racism-a-public-health-crisis/#x'), ('The Denver Channel, City Council declares racism health crisis, June 8, 2020', 'No link'), ('The Guardian, ‘Long overdue’: lawmakers declare racism a public health emergency, June 12, 2020', 'https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2019/01/08/milwaukee-most-segregated-area-country-brookings-says/2512258002/'), ('Boston Health Commission, Mayor Walsh Declares Racism a Public Health Crisis, June 12, 2020', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, Disproportionately black counties account for over half of coronavirus cases in the U.S. and nearly 60% of deaths, study finds, May 6, 2020', 'https://www.jsonline.com/story/life/wisconsin-family/2019/05/09/doulas-want-lower-milwaukees-high-black-infant-mortality-rate/3340635002/'), ('Jeanette Kowalik, Letter to MKE Common Council, May 16, 2019', 'No link'), ('ProPublica,\xa0Early Data Shows African Americans Have Contracted and Died of Coronavirus at an Alarming Rate, April 3, 2020', 'https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/front-range/denver/denver-city-council-approves-proclamation-calling-racism-a-public-health-crisis')]",/factchecks/2020/jun/18/jeanette-kowalik/milwaukee-was-among-first-declare-racism-public-he/

Donald Trump’s Pants on Fire claim that nobody had heard of Juneteenth
","President Donald Trump took credit for boosting awareness of Juneteenth, a day that marks the end of slavery in America. ""I did something good: I made Juneteenth very famous,"" Mr. Trump said, in a Wall Street Journal interview. ""It’s actually an important event, an important time. But nobody had ever heard of it."" Trump had originally planned his first political rally in more than three months in Tulsa, Okla., for June 19. He moved the rally to June 20 after, he said, African American leaders asked him to. It is fair to say that outrage over George Floyd’s death while in police custody, combined with vocal demonstrations and the Black Lives Matter movement, have raised the profile of Juneteenth and its meaning to new heights. Trump’s planned rally in Tulsa fueled that sentiment. But his suggestion that no one knew about it ignores history; the day has held significance for millions of Americans for decades. Juneteenth stems from June 19, 1865, when Union troops under Gen. Gordon Granger landed in Galveston, Texas. Granger’s men marched through the city reading General Order No. 3 at municipal buildings and churches, declaring that all slaves were now free. African American leaders held the first celebration to mark the day on June 19, 1866. Trump’s assertion that he made the day famous is a matter of opinion, but we can fact-check his claim that ""nobody had ever heard of it."" Millions of Americans had heard of Juneteenth before Trump’s scheduling shift. ""Today, if Americans have any knowledge at all about commemorations of the end of U.S. slavery, their reference point is generally Juneteenth,"" historian Mitch Kachun wrote in 2007. In 1980, Texas made June 19 a state holiday. Today, 47 states recognize the day. New York and Virginia just moved to make it a state holiday. In 2019, celebrations were held in cities nationwide, including New York City, Sacramento, Houston, New Orleans, Sioux Falls, S.D., Richmond, Va., Tulsa, Okla., Milwaukee, Kansas City, Mo., and the list goes on and on. From Texas in 1866, the Juneteenth tradition spread to surrounding states. It was popular in Oklahoma, where a young African American writer named Ralph Ellison grew up. Ellison wrote a short story entitled ""Juneteenth."" It became a key chapter in Ellison’s posthumously published novel bearing the same title. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the social justice overtones of Juneteenth grew more prominent. In 1968, the Poor People’s March on Washington firmly embedded Juneteenth in the Civil Rights movement. The march that traveled through the South had its final day of speeches and music at the Lincoln Memorial before an estimated crowd of 50,000 on June 19, 1968. Juneteenth.com, one of several efforts to promote recognition of the day, tracked large events in Milwaukee and Minneapolis back to the 1968 march. Starting in the 1990s, books aimed at younger readers popularized the tradition. The head of a group that promoted Juneteenth presented a copy of ""Juneteenth: A Celebration of Freedom"" to then-governor of Alaska Sarah Palin at the Alaska Juneteenth Conference in Anchorage in 2009, where the governor spoke about the significance of Juneteenth in her state. Under Trump, the White House has issued statements every year to recognize Juneteenth. Trump said that nobody had heard of Juneteenth until this year. The history is clear. Long before Trump was elected president, millions of Americans knew about the day that marks the end of slavery in America. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.","[('Wall Street Journal, Trump Talks Juneteenth, John Bolton, Economy, June 18, 2020', 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-talks-juneteenth-john-bolton-economy-in-wsj-interview-11592493771'), ('Oxford University Press blog, Thoughts on Juneteenth, June 22, 2007', 'No link'), ('Conference on Lincoln and the Civil War in Contemporary America, Celebrating Freedom: Juneteenth and the Emancipation Festival Tradition, Feb. 6, 2009', 'https://blog.oup.com/2007/06/juneteenth/'), ('Galveston History Foundation, JUNETEENTH AND GENERAL ORDER NO. 3, June 10, 2020', 'No link'), ('National Museum of African American History and Culture, The Historical Legacy of Juneteenth, accessed June 15, 2020', 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVNsoeWKfnnRCMVtM-G2Cef0TUJ6-UAO/view?usp=sharing'), ('National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, About, accessed June 15, 2020', 'No link'), ('Oxford African American Studies Center, Emancipation and the Meaning of Juneteenth, accessed June 17, 2020', 'https://www.galvestonhistory.org/news/juneteenth-and-general-order-no-3'), ('Juneteenth.com, History of Juneteenth, accessed June 15, 2020', 'No link'), (""Civil Rights Digital Library, Series of WSB-TV newsfilm clips of African Americans celebrating and demonstrating as they prepare for the Poor People's March on Washington, 1968, accessed June 17, 2020"", 'https://nmaahc.si.edu/blog-post/historical-legacy-juneteenth'), ('PBS, What Is Juneteenth?, accessed June 18, 2020', 'No link'), ('The Atlantic, The Quintessential Americanness of Juneteenth, June 19, 2017', 'http://nationaljuneteenth.com/Juneteenth_Movement.html'), ('Interview, Mitch Kachun, emeritus professor of history, Western Michigan University, June 16, 2020', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2020/jun/18/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-nobody-had-heard-ju/

Facebook Post Falsely Claims Independents In California Are Blocked From Voting Republican In 2020
","A Facebook post that gained traction ahead of California’s presidential primary in March has new life, but spouts some of the same misleading information.  The post — reposted to Facebook June 6 — claims California’s registered independents must re-register with the GOP ""to vote republican come 2020."" It also alleges, without evidence, that the state came up with this requirement ""hoping no one figures it out in time.""   It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook). We fact-checked similar misinformation ahead of the primary. But with this post re-circulating, we decided to set the record straight, again.  Differences Between California’s Primary and General Elections According to the California Secretary of State’s Office, political parties — not state officials  — decide whether and how the state’s independent voters, also known as No Party Preference voters, can participate in each party’s presidential primary election.  The restrictions make it more difficult but not impossible to vote for your favorite candidate. For example, the Democratic party required California’s more than 5 million registered independents to request a ""crossover ballot"" in March to vote for a Democratic presidential candidate. But it did not force them to re-register. By contrast, the Republican party required independent voters to register with the GOP to participate in its primary. So, the warning in the first part of the Facebook post was correct — for the March primary.  These requirements, however, do not apply to California’s November general election. ""The assertion in that Facebook post is absolutely not true,"" Sam Mahood, spokesperson for the California Secretary of State’s Office, wrote in an email this week. ""In a General Election you can vote for any candidate, regardless of the voter’s party."" Mahood cited California Elections Code section 13206.5, which covers statewide general elections and states: ""All voters, regardless of the party preference they disclosed upon registration, or refusal to disclose a party preference, may vote for any candidate for a voter-nominated or nonpartisan office."" Our ruling A resurfaced Facebook post claims California’s registered independents must re-register as Republicans to vote for GOP candidates ""come 2020."" It also alleges that California came up with this rule ""hoping no one figures it out in time.""  The first part was correct for the March primary. But it doesn’t apply to California’s November general election, when voters can select the candidate of their choice, no matter their party affiliation.  The second part is false. The political parties, not the state, set the rules for participating in presidential primaries.  This post was partially-wrong the first time. Now, the whole thing is wrong.

Donald Trump falsely says Obama administration did not try to do police reforms
","Amid mounting calls from Americans for changes in policing practices and end to excessive use of force, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that he said is intended to encourage police departments to adopt the highest professional standards. Reforming policing practices is difficult, and the Obama administration didn’t even try to do it because it didn’t know how to do so, Trump claimed. ""We will have reform without undermining our many great and extremely talented law enforcement officers,"" Trump said June 16. ""President (Barack) Obama and Vice President (Joe) Biden never even tried to fix this during their eight-year period. The reason they didn't try is because they had no idea how to do it, and it is a complex situation."" PolitiFact reviewed measures taken by the Obama administration and consulted with law  enforcement and criminal justice experts to evaluate Trump’s claim. Trump’s statement is wrong. ""The Obama administration did more with respect to police reform and misconduct than any administration in the modern area and it was a personal commitment for the president and for Attorney General Eric Holder,"" said David Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. We asked the White House and Trump’s reelection campaign for information that backed Trump’s claim. We did not hear back. Obama in December 2014, through an executive order, established the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing in the wake of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. The task force issued its final report in May 2015, after holding public listening sessions across the country and getting testimony and recommendations from community and faith leaders, law enforcement officers, academics, and others. One of the recommendations focused on law enforcement policies and community oversight, saying policies must reflect community values and not lead to practices with disparate impacts. Law enforcement agencies should have review boards that look into cases of officer-involved shootings and other serious incidents that can damage community trust or confidence in the agency, the report said. ""Not only should there be policies for deadly and nondeadly uses of force but a clearly stated ‘sanctity of life’ philosophy must also be in the forefront of every officer’s mind,"" the report said. ""This way of thinking should be accompanied by rigorous practical ongoing training in an atmosphere of nonjudgmental and safe sharing of views with fellow officers about how they behaved in use of force situations."" The report ""still serves as an important playbook for the policing field on where reform should be going,"" said Laurie Robinson, a professor at George Mason University and co-chair of the Task Force on 21st Century Policing. Beyond the task force, the Obama administration also investigated police departments for patterns or practices that violated constitutional or federal rights. Those investigations don’t center on one single incident. They examine broader behavior to determine whether there’s misconduct within a department. The administration also pushed for consent decrees, court-enforced negotiated agreements that specify remedies departments must implement to correct misconduct. The notion that the Obama administration didn’t try police reform because they didn’t know what to do is not accurate, said Kennedy, the research center director at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. The Obama-era policies were aimed at preventing police violence and police misconduct, improving policing and police-community relations, he said. ""That was an administration that made these issues a priority,"" said Kennedy, who was part of the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice. PolitiFact tracked more than a dozen promises Obama made about criminal justice, including his pledge to ban racial profiling by federal law enforcement agencies. Toward the end of his tenure, we rated that a Compromise, because no related bill passed Congress during Obama's administration, but the Justice Department did overhaul its rules to address racial profiling. In 2016, the Justice Department under Obama said it would continue to help implement the task force's findings and train law enforcement agents to recognize and address implicit bias, unconscious or subtle associations that individuals make between groups of people and stereotypes about those groups. Trump’s claim that Obama and Biden didn’t even try police reforms is ""patently false,"" said Sean M. Smoot, director and chief legal counsel of the Police Benevolent and Protective Association of Illinois and a member of the Obama task force. The Obama administration also sought funding for the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services within the Justice Department.

Trump said, ""President Obama and Vice President Biden never even tried to fix this during their eight-year period."" The record shows that is not true. After the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson and related racial justice protests, Obama established a task force to examine better policing practices.

Bogus conspiracy about Obama, others wearing house arrest monitors spreads online
","A Facebook post shares a bogus conspiracy theory that claims certain ""elite"" or Hollywood figures, like former President Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey, are involved in child trafficking rings. The post shares a collage of photos that include Obama and Winfrey, as well as Hillary Clinton and Ellen DeGeneres. Text above the photo says, ""Elite/Hollywood figures on house arrest with ankle monitors, due to child trafficking crimes."" The post attempts to prove this by revealing that all are wearing ankle bracelets in the images. But some of the photos are obscured, while others were digitally altered. One image accurately shows ankle wear on Obama, but it’s not a house arrest monitor. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  First, there is no evidence that Obama, Winfrey, DeGeneres or Clinton are involved in child trafficking and none have been arrested, or placed on house arrest, for any crime.  The photos of DeGeneres and Winfrey are both obscured and show bulges underneath their pants, near their ankles. This is far from proving these are house arrest monitors, and we couldn’t track down the original images. Winfrey also addressed false rumors in March that she had been arrested. The photo of Hillary Clinton was taken in 2014 in the Hamptons. The Facebook post’s version was digitally altered to include a device on her right leg. Clinton is not wearing any kind of bracelet or monitor, on either leg, in the original photo or in other photos from that day.  The photo of Obama shows him paddle boarding in January 2020 in Hawaii. The bracelet on his ankle is real, but it’s not a house arrest monitor. The device is called a ""SharkBanz,"" which uses technology to deter a shark attack.

Fact-checking claims from a Chris Jacobs-Nate McMurray debate
","Republican Chris Jacobs and Democrat Nate McMurray are facing off in a June 23 special election for a congressional seat in western New York, and may also face each other in the regular election in November. Their June 13 debate got heated. In the debate, Jacobs, a state senator, brought attention to past tweets by McMuray, his rival to fill the 27th district vacancy created when Republican Rep. Chris Collins stepped down earlier this year. Here’s a rundown of three assertions by Jacobs, with an analysis of their accuracy. Jacobs said, ""Nate tweeted, ‘Gun owners are part of the most insecure and dangerous club on earth.’""  During the debate, McMurray countered that Jacobs ""is literally making stuff up.""  Both sides have a point. McMurray did tweet about ""the most insecure and dangerous club"" last year, but Jacobs suggested that McMurray had targeted a broader group of gun owners for that description. Jacobs was referring to an Aug. 3, 2019, tweet in which McMurray said, ""YOU WANT TO BE A MAN? Make something. Build something. Better, help someone. Serve someone. Care for them. Your damn assault rifle has no part in that. It just makes part of the most insecure and dangerous club in the world."" YOU WANT TO BE A MAN? Make something. Build something. Better, help someone. Serve someone. Care for them. Your damn assault rifle has no part in that. It just makes part of the most insecure and dangerous club in the world. Kate Walker McArdle, McMurray’s communication director, said Jacobs had unfairly conflated ""gun owners"" with ""assault rifle"" owners. McMurray ""specifically referenced assault-style weapons in his tweet,"" she said. ""While Nate is a gun owner, he was also conveying the fact that owning an assault rifle doesn't make one a ‘man.’  His vision for America does not include assault weapons."" Soon after, Jacobs said that McMurray had ""said the NRA are homegrown terrorists."" (The NRA is the National Rifle Association, a prominent pro-gun group.) Here too, Jacobs has a point, though he oversimplifies a bit. On March 8, 2018, McMurray tweeted a response to a video advertisement from NRATV, an NRA affiliate, that featured conservative commentator Dana Loesch holding a large hourglass.  In his tweeted response, McMurray wrote, ""If ISIS made a video as threatening as the NRA’s hourglass offering, we would all be legitimately freaked out. Who is behind this ‘genius’ marketing? Are they channeling Margaret Hamilton in the Wizard of Oz? Yikes. #HomeGrownTerrorism"" If ISIS made a video as threatening as the NRA’s hourglass offering, we would all be legitimately freaked out. Who is behind this “genius” marketing? Are they channeling Margaret Hamilton in the Wizard of Oz? Yikes. #HomeGrownTerrorism pic.twitter.com/IkBGdNMNkG So McMurray did not outright call the NRA ""homegrown terrorists,"" his use of the hashtag above essentially aligns with Jacobs’ claim.  Walker McArdle told PolitiFact, ""This tweet was calling out the NRA for their scare tactics and videos that were highly scrutinized for threatening violence against Americans and journalists. (McMurray) did not say, ‘the NRA is a terrorist organization.’"" Jacobs pulled a third claim from McMurray’s Twitter feed before the end of the night.  Jacobs said, ""I am pro-life; (McMurray) is pro-abortion. He said abortion opponents are the American Taliban. That’s another tweet of Nate McMurray."" McMurray has in fact referenced the ""Taliban"" or the ""American Taliban"" in tweets about abortion before. On July 3, 2018, McMurray tweeted, ""DO THE MATH: 67% of the public is pro choice according to recent polls. Only 2 Republican members of Congress are pro-choice. 1 President actually said he wants to PUNISH women for abortion. Forget Democracy, forget mental health, act like the Taliban and PUNISH women. OR VOTE!"" DO THE MATH:67% of the public is pro choice according to recent polls Only 2 Republican members of Congress are pro-choice1 President actually said he wants to PUNISH women for abortionForget Democracy, forget mental health, act like the Taliban and PUNISH womenOR VOTE! We found two other tweets in which McMurray does use the exact phrase, ""American Taliban."" Walker McArdle countered, ""Nate did not use the phrase ‘American Taliban.’ Just as the phrase ‘act like spoiled children’ do(es) not literally mean that the person is a spoiled child, ‘act like the Taliban’ doesn’t literally suggest someone is a member of the Taliban. But if the accusation is that Nate does not believe women should be punished for getting an abortion, that is correct."" Jacobs’ campaign team did not provide any further information or context for what Jacobs said during the debate. Jacobs said McMurray had said that ""gun owners are part of the most insecure and dangerous club on earth,"" that ""the NRA are homegrown terrorists,"" and that ""abortion opponents are the American Taliban."" In each case, McMurray did tweet something very close to what Jacobs cited in the debate, although sometimes with slightly different wording from what Jacobs used. The biggest divergence was in the first of these claims, in which McMurray was referring to people who own assault weapons rather than gun owners more generally. The statements are accurate but need additional information, so we rate them Mostly True.","[('YouTube, ""McMurray-Jacobs Debate,"" Nate McMurray, June 13, 2020', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDIFqADFGoQ&feature=youtu.be'), ('@Nate_McMurray, tweet, March 8, 2018', 'No link'), ('@Nate_McMurray, tweet, July 3, 2018', 'https://twitter.com/Nate_McMurray/status/971712272518336512'), ('@Nate_McMurray, tweet, April 11, 2019', 'No link'), ('@NRATV, tweet, March 4, 2018', 'https://twitter.com/Nate_McMurray/status/1014107354621759488'), ('Email interview with Christian Chase, communications director for the Jacobs campaign, July 15, 2020', 'No link'), ('Email interviews with Kate Walker McArdle, communications director for the McMurray campaign, July 16, 2020', 'https://twitter.com/Nate_McMurray/status/1116212050613686274')]",/factchecks/2020/jun/18/chris-jacobs/fact-checking-claims-chris-jacobs-nate-mcmurray-de/

Do two months of coronavirus deaths exceed the number of drug overdoses in the last year?
","A federal prosecutor and a state lawmaker from western New York sparred recently over the scale of coronavirus deaths in their state. In a May 30 op-ed in the Buffalo News, James P. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of New York, urged a quicker reopening of the economy, in part because he said that a failure to do so would cause psychological harm and spur deaths from drug abuse. In the op-ed, Kennedy said he has seen a ""roughly three-fold increase in the number of drug overdose deaths"" during the pandemic. As the country is struggling economically, he wrote, ""such measures come at a cost that goes well beyond the adverse impact they have had on our economy."" This argument drew a response from Monica P. Wallace, a Democratic assemblywoman for the 143rd District of New York. She told the Buffalo News that Kennedy glossed over the reality that significantly more people died due to the coronavirus in two months than died of overdoses all of last year. The Buffalo News paraphrased Wallace’s remark this way: ""Wallace said Kennedy failed to mention that significantly more people died of Covid-19 in two months than died of overdoses all of last year or the year before."" When we reached her, Wallace confirmed that the paraphrase was accurate. We found that her assertion is correct. For the number of coronavirus deaths, Wallace referred us to a count by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found from the beginning of April until the end of May, approximately 96,647 people died in the United States. The total number of deaths through mid-June was 103,339, according to the CDC. However, this may be an underestimate due to difficulties in collecting the full data. For the number of overdoses, Wallace referred us to CDC data.  The CDC’s most recent full-year data is for 2018. That year, there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths. In 2017, there were 70,237 overdose deaths.  So the national figures show that the two-month toll of coronavirus deaths exceeded the year-long number of drug overdose deaths in both 2017 and 2018. The same was true for New York state. There were 21,964 coronavirus deaths in New York state between the start of April and the end of May, according to the COVID Tracking Project. That compares to 3,697 drug overdose deaths for all of 2018 in New York state and 3,921 in 2017. Wallace said that significantly more people died of Covid-19 in two months than died of overdoses all of last year or the year before. She’s correct. Nationally, more than 96,000 Americans died of the coronavirus in April and May 2020, compared to a bit more than 70,000 Americans who died of drug overdoses in the higher of the two most recent years, 2017. We rate the statement True.","[('The Buffalo News, ""Federal Prosecutors Playing Politics with Shutdown State Lawmakers Say,"" June 8, 2020', 'https://buffalonews.com/2020/06/08/federal-prosecutor-playing-politics-with-shutdown-state-lawmakers-say/'), ('The Buffalo News, ""Legal Tensions Flare during Pandemic, May 30, 2020', 'No link'), ('Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""National Center for Health Statistics,"" June 15, 2020', 'https://buffalonews.com/2020/05/30/legal-tensions-flare-during-pandemic-shutdown/'), ('Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""Drug Overdose Deaths,"" accessed June 17, 2020', 'No link'), ('Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""STATCAST,"" September 9, 2019\xa0', 'https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm'), ('World Health Organization, ""United States of America COVID-19 Cases,"" June 15, 2020', 'No link'), ('National Conference of State Legislatures, ""President Trump Declares State of Emergency for COVID-19,"" March 25, 2020', 'https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html'), ('Syracuse.com, ""Progress against coronavirus in New York is ‘breathtaking’ Cuomo says,"" June 2, 2020', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Monica P.

Hoax websites republish made-up article about protesters, George Soros
","A recent article that was widely shared on Facebook is a trifecta of misinformation: a recurring hoax about paid protesters, liberal financier George Soros and a junk website registered in Pakistan. The article, which was published on a site called Englishwire.today on June 12, claims that ""163 paid protesters have filed a lawsuit against none other than George Soros for screwing them out of bail money."" ""According to the ad Soros placed on Craigslist, protesters would be fully compensated for all of their time and expenses,"" reads the article. ""They found out that the money dried up the moment they got arrested."" The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story has been widely shared in conspiratorial and conservative Facebook groups. One link to the article hosted on MailChimp, an email newsletter service, includes a photo of protests with the Guardian’s logo so that, when Facebook users share the Englishwire.today story, it’s posted with the image. (Screenshot from MailChimp) But the photo shows Yellow Vest protesters in France in 2018 — and the Englishwire.today article is bogus. It was copied from a website that claims to publish satire.  The source of the story about paid protesters and Soros is a website called Taters Gonna Tate. It’s part of ""the ‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery,"" which is run by a man named Christopher Blair. Blair has been publishing made-up stories for years. He claims the articles are satirical, and that his goal is to trick conservatives into sharing false claims on social media. While Blair’s stories have disclaimers asserting that they’re satirical, scam news websites frequently copy and paste the articles without any context to fool people into believing them. Public domain records indicate that Englishwire.today was registered June 11 using NameCheap, a popular web hosting platform for online scammers. A nearly identical website called Iolgue.xyz — which was registered May 2 in Punjab, Pakistan — published the same article about paid protesters on the same day as Englishwire.today. Like the MailChimp link, it includes the lifted Yellow Vests photo from the Guardian. Republishing Blair’s stories is a common tactic among online scammers looking to make a buck from disinformation. We previously wrote about how a network of more than 100 hoax websites used AdSense, Google’s advertising service, to profit from clicks on the stolen, made-up stories. That network also appeared to be based in Pakistan. Hoaxes about paid protesters have circulated on social media for several years. More recently, conservative commentators have falsely claimed that Soros, through his Open Society Foundations, has paid people to violently protest against police brutality and racism in the United States. There is no evidence to support that assertion. Open Society Foundations has not given grants to organizations to support violent protesting. The article is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Fact-checking a claim about Trump, fired scientists, Anthony Fauci and China
","A total of 54 scientists have lost their jobs as a result of an ongoing federal investigation into whether they properly disclosed financial ties they had to foreign countries, primarily China. But a Facebook post that cites the terminations is a little loose with the facts. And it misleadingly links Anthony Fauci, one of the leading federal experts fighting the coronavirus pandemic, to the National Institutes of Health’s investigation. Here’s what the June 15 post said: ""Trump administration just FIRED 54 scientists & cut off 77 grants at Fauci's NIH for not disclosing their ties to Communist China!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The National Institutes of Health, or NIH, is the largest single public funder of biomedical research in the world, and 156 of its funded researchers have received Nobel Prizes for their work, according to the Congressional Research Service.  NIH is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, a Cabinet-level agency led by Secretary Alex Azar, an appointee of President Donald Trump.  Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is part of NIH. The director of the NIH is Francis Collins. In 2018, NIH announced it had concerns about protecting the integrity of U.S. biomedical research, ""including the failure by some researchers at NIH-funded institutions to disclose substantial contributions of resources from other organizations, including foreign governments, which threatens to distort decisions about the appropriate use of NIH funds."" The agency said it would work with other government agencies, NIH-funded academic institutions and others to investigate any failures by researchers to report substantial contributions. In a June 12 report, NIH said 54 scientists have resigned or been fired. There were also 77 scientists who have been removed from the NIH system, meaning they are no longer eligible for NIH grants. An NIH spokeswoman told PolitiFact that all the scientists worked at NIH-funded institutions, such as universities. They were not employed as NIH scientists. She said NIH is not releasing specific information on the scientists involved. In 93% of the cases, the hidden funding came from a Chinese institution. The journal Science, which first reported on the update, said NIH has been in the forefront of federal efforts to identify and block behavior that many U.S. government officials say poses a significant threat to the country’s economic well-being and to national security. Prominent Harvard case One prominent case of this type is that of Charles Lieber, the former chair of Harvard University’s Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department. He was indicted June 9 on charges of making false statements to federal authorities regarding his participation in China’s Thousand Talents Program. He has pleaded not guilty.  Here’s a summary from the U.S. Justice Department: Lieber’s research at the Lieber Research Group has been funded by more than $15 million in research grants from the NIH and the Defense Department. The grants required the disclosure of all sources of research support, potential financial conflicts of interest and all foreign collaboration. It is alleged that, unbeknownst to Harvard University, he became a ""strategic scientist"" at Wuhan University of Technology in China and a contractual participant in the Thousand Talents Plan. Under the terms of Lieber’s three-year Thousand Talents contract, Wuhan University of Technology allegedly paid Lieber a salary of up to $50,000 per month, living expenses of up to 1 million Chinese Yuan (approximately $158,000 at the time) and awarded him more than $1.5 million to establish a research lab at WUT.  In November 2018, NIH inquired of Harvard whether Lieber had failed to disclose his then-suspected relationship with WUT and China’s Thousand Talents Plan. Lieber allegedly caused Harvard to falsely tell NIH that Lieber ""had no formal association with WUT"" after 2012, that ""WUT continued to falsely exaggerate"" his involvement with WUT in subsequent years, and that Lieber ""is not and has never been a participant in"" China’s Thousand Talents Plan. A Facebook post claimed: ""Trump administration just FIRED 54 scientists & cut off 77 grants at Fauci's NIH for not disclosing their ties to Communist China!"" There are 54 scientists who were either fired or resigned as a result of an NIH investigation into scientists failing to disclose financial ties to other countries, with the vast majority of cases involving China. There were also 77 scientists, not grants, who are no longer eligible for NIH grants; it’s not that grant money to them was cut off.  It’s also wrong to say NIH is Fauci’s agency; Fauci leads one division of NIH.

No, white people didn’t dub black boxer Jack Johnson’s invention a monkey wrench
","Rapper Snoop Dogg shared a meme about the world’s first African-American heavyweight boxing champion and a claim of racism. The meme, which includes an image of boxer Jack Johnson, claims that while in prison, Johnson invented and patented the very first wrench — and that white people insulted him by calling it the monkey wrench. The meme is labeled, ""Knowledge is key. This is DEEP."" It reads: ""On February 3, 1903 Jack Johnson became the first ‘negro’ heavy weight title champion. But, did you know he was also an inventor? While in Jail in Kansas, he invented the wrench! In 1922 he received a patent for his invention. In fact, white people still found a way to tarnish this great accomplishment by dubbing it the ‘monkey wrench’. A term many use freely today. Do the math!"" The June 15 Instagram post, which gained more than 700,000 likes, was shared during the fourth week of national protests over police brutality following the death of George Floyd. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Johnson, the son of former slaves, won the unified heavyweight championship in 1908. The International Boxing Hall of Fame shared this description of him: ""A gaudy, bold character who lived just as he wanted, Johnson enraged the defenders of white supremacy with his refusal to accept anything less than equality. He was beloved by blacks and some whites, but thoroughly hated and eventually conquered by those who saw him as a threat to America's divided society."" In 1913, Johnson was convicted of violating the Mann Act, which made it a felony to transport across state lines ""any woman or girls for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose,"" but was used to prosecute people involved in premarital, extramarital and interracial relationships. Johnson was traveling with his white girlfriend who later became his wife. He served a year at Leavenworth federal prison in Kansas. President Donald Trump posthumously pardoned Johnson in 2018, saying he had received a request from Sylvester Stallone. Johnson was awarded a patent for a wrench that improved gripping and made disassembly easier.  ""My invention relates to improvements in wrenches and has for its object to provide an improved wrench, which is of simple and durable construction, reliable in operation and easy and inexpensive to manufacture, which may be easily and readily adjusted and which is adapted to exert a powerful gripping action upon the work,"" he wrote in his application, which was filed in March 1921. The patent was awarded in April 1922. Johnson had conceptualized and diagrammed a tool to help tighten loosening fastening devices while at Leavenworth, according to the Jim Crow Museum at Ferris State University in Michigan.  But the first wrench had been patented in 1835, and the first monkey wrench was patented around 1858.  A monkey wrench, by the way, is a wrench with one fixed and one adjustable jaw at right angles to a straight handle. There is some dispute about the origin of the name ""monkey wrench."" The Jim Crow Museum says that it was named using a purposeful misspelling of the name of the inventor, Charles Moncky. An alternative explanation is that the wrench was invented before Moncky’s wrench and got its name because it was similar to a ""key wrench,"" but was different enough to be called a ""non-key"" wrench. Johnson did get a patent for a wrench he invented while in prison. But it was not the first wrench ever invented, and the original as well as one that became known as the monkey wrench were patented decades earlier. The origin of the monkey wrench name had nothing to do with Johnson.  We rate the statement False.","[('Instagram, post (archived here), June 15, 2020', 'https://www.instagram.com/p/CBcqOkyDDH8/?utm_source=ig_embed'), ('Snopes, ""Did Jack Johnson Invent the Monkey Wrench?"", Dec. 14, 2015', 'No link'), ('Ferris State University Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia, ""Jack Johnson and the Wrench,"" February 2005\xa0', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/jack-johnsons-monkey-wrench/'), ('Google Patents, Patent US1413121A, accessed June 17, 2020', 'No link'), ('Wisconsin State Journal, ""Curiosities: Why do they call it a monkey wrench?"", Nov 28, 2010', 'https://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/question/2005/february.htm'), ('Africa Check, ""‘Monkey wrench’ dates to 1800s – not name given to boxer Jack Johnson’s invention,"" Aug. 8 2019', 'No link'), ('Email, Ferris State University Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia founder and director David Pilgrim, June 18, 2020', 'https://patents.google.com/patent/US1413121A/en')]",/factchecks/2020/jun/18/snoop-dogg/no-white-people-didnt-dub-black-boxer-jack-johnson/

Social posts comparing ‘defund the police’ to Nazi Germany need a history lesson
","Conservative Facebook and Instagram accounts are criticizing calls to defund the police by comparing them to Nazi Germany. A June 14 post from an Instagram account called Republican Army claims that, after Adolf Hitler appointed Hermann Göring as interior minister in 1933, Göring worked to ""defund and eliminate the police departments so that they would not interfere with his Brown Shirts."" ""The Brown Shirt’s (sic) mission was to riot, burn, beat up and kill citizens in an effort to sway the elections to ensure their National Socialist agenda,"" reads text in the image, which includes a photo of men in uniform blocking the entrance to a building. ""Now today’s American socialist leaders want to defund and eliminate the police? Is history repeating itself?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) It has thousands of likes, and several similar posts have been shared by other Instagram and Facebook users — including at least one candidate running for Senate. (Screenshot from Instagram) Since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in late May, demonstrators around the country have protested against police brutality and discrimination against black Americans. Some activists have called to ""defund the police."" Did Hitler — who oversaw the murder of millions of Jews and other marginalized groups during the Holocaust — call for a similar action? We opened our history books to investigate. The Instagram post is inaccurate. While the Nazis reorganized German police forces, it had nothing to do with elections — and they did not defund or eliminate police departments. The photo in the post shows Nazis blocking Jews from entering the University of Vienna in 1938. ""There was literally no movement ever to defund or eliminate police departments in Nazi Germany,"" said Waitman Beorn, a senior lecturer in history at Northumbria University, in a Twitter thread about the post. ""The terminology of ‘defunding the police’ has no analogy there."" First, let’s review some facts about Göring, Hitler’s rise to power and the ""Brownshirts."" Göring was a high-ranking Nazi official and one of Hitler’s closest allies. He is credited with helping to create the Nazi police state in Germany. Göring joined the National Socialist German Workers’ (Nazi) Party in 1922. Hitler, who had assumed control of the party one year prior, gave Göring command of the Brownshirts or ""Storm Troopers,"" officially known as the Sturmabteilung (SA). The paramilitary organization was outfitted in brown uniforms and tasked with protecting party meetings, intimidating voters and assaulting political opponents. In 1932, after the Nazis won 230 seats in the Reichstag, Göring was elected president of the German legislative body. But Paul von Hindenburg, president of the Weimar Republic, was reluctant to appoint Hitler as chancellor.  That changed in January 1933, when — after a series of negotiations — Hitler was appointed head of state. After Hitler became chancellor, he appointed Göring to his cabinet and, later, interior minister of Prussia — not of the entire country, as the Instagram post implies. And instead of eliminating police forces, he created a new one. Göring used his position to Nazify the Prussian police and establish the Gestapo. The political police force was tasked with eliminating opposition to the party and later worked in tandem with the Schutzstaffel (SS) to deport Jews to concentration camps. ""This had ZERO to do with elections. There were no more free elections after 1933,"" Beorn said in his Twitter thread. RELATED: No, gun control regulation in Nazi Germany did not help advance the Holocaust In February 1933, Göring authorized the appointment of the SA and the SS as auxiliary police personnel, which co-opted the Brownshirts into the regular police force. Simultaneously, Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, similarly reorganized the police of the remaining German states. In April 1933, the Nazis passed a law that allowed state interior ministries to purge police personnel, which led to the firing of ""non-Aryan"" officers and those who had opposed the Nazis. That strategy — while it did fundamentally change the nature of policing in Germany in the lead-up to World War II — was not akin to defunding and eliminating police departments. ""The very moment the Nazis were in power in each of the German states, they could simply change personnel as well as policies in local police departments,"" said Thomas Weber, a history and international affairs professor at the University of Aberdeen who has authored several books about Hitler. ""This meant that the Nazis had full control over police departments the moment they took over the state government in which that particular police department lay."" ""It would thus simply have made no sense for the Nazis to defund or eliminate police departments, as they already had full control over them."" ""Defund the police"" has become a rallying cry for some activists protesting police brutality against black Americans. But the phrase means different things to different people. In a June 8 ""Ask Me Anything"" thread on Reddit, Kailee Scales, managing director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network, said the group is calling for ""divestment in police in order to support more teachers, mental health and restorative services, and community resilience departments, social workers, and government resource liaisons."" ""I know that sounds like a lot to take in, but simply, it is the idea of creating the ‘American Dream’ for all — less cops on streets and better schools and social programming,"" she said in the thread. The argument for defunding the police goes like this: Many police departments across the country have large budgets. Other departments, such as those that oversee public health and family services, have smaller budgets. Some activists say that, by shifting money from police departments to other parts of municipal government, violence against black Americans would go down. Meanwhile, some are calling for police departments to be abolished altogether. In Minneapolis, where Floyd died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck, most city council members have pledged to dismantle the police department.  ""Decades of police reform efforts have proved that the Minneapolis Police Department cannot be reformed and will never be accountable for its actions,"" council members said at a June 7 meeting. ""We are here today to begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department and creating a new, transformative model for cultivating safety in Minneapolis."" RELATED: ‘Defund the police’ movement: What do activists mean by that? However, the details are still up in the air. Council President Lisa Bender tweeted that the police department would be replaced ""with a transformative new model of public safety."" But she has also said that, while she doesn’t want to invest in more policing, the idea of having no police department ""is certainly not"" in the short-term plan. Regardless, both abolishing and defunding the police are very different from Hitler and Göring’s strategy of Nazifying the police in 1930s Germany. However, the distinction comes with a caveat. ""When the Nazis came to power, they eliminated police unions, as they viewed unions of policemen as anti-Nazi institutions,"" Weber said. ""So the Nazis did defund and eliminate police unions in 1933, but they certainly did not defund and eliminate police departments."" An Instagram post claims that Nazi’s defunded and eliminated police departments in Germany. That’s wrong. In reality, the Nazis relied on police forces to maintain control of Germany and commit genocide in the lead-up to World War II. That is very different from today’s calls to ""defund the police,"" which can mean anything from divesting from police departments to abolishing the police altogether. The Instagram post is inaccurate.

Pelosi didn’t gift Floyd family ‘special service flag’ reserved for military
","Conservative bloggers and social media users are criticizing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for presenting George Floyd’s family with a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol, wrongly claiming that such an honor is solely reserved for the families of veterans and first responders. ""Speaker Pelosi presents a special ‘service flag’ to Mr. Floyd’s family and sparks major outrage,"" said the headline to a June 15 article on Waynedupree.com. Conservative radio host Wayne Dupree has leveled inaccurate allegations against Pelosi before. A reader asked us about the headline, which was also flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that the headline, which has since been changed, was misleading. The flag Pelosi presented was an American flag. It was not a ""special service flag"" that can only be furnished for the families of dead veterans or first responders, as the headline suggested. ""Members of Congress do this routinely,"" said Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff. Dupree told us the article’s author has since changed the headline to remove the reference to service. The body of the article has been similarly changed. The new headline is more accurate. ""Speaker Pelosi presents a ‘special flag’ to Mr. Floyd’s family and sparks major outrage,"" it says. Similar headlines on other conservative blog sites, including Neon Nettle and InfoWars, more explicitly claimed that the flag was meant for fallen veterans, which is not accurate. The article highlights an image that Pelosi, D-Calif., uploaded to Twitter and Facebook after Floyd’s brother Philonise Floyd testified before Congress on June 10 about police mistreatment of black Americans and George Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis. The image shows Pelosi and a member of her staff presenting an American flag, folded into a triangle within a display case, to Philonise Floyd and the Floyd family’s attorney, Ben Crump. ""Philonise Floyd’s heart-wrenching testimony to @HouseJudiciary left its mark on us all,"" Pelosi wrote on Twitter. ""May this flag, which flew over the Capitol on the day of his brother’s murder, serve as a symbol of our shared commitment to securing justice for George & all victims of police violence.""  Philonise Floyd’s heart-wrenching testimony to @HouseJudiciary left its mark on us all. May this flag, which flew over the Capitol on the day of his brother’s murder, serve as a symbol of our shared commitment to securing justice for George & all victims of police violence. pic.twitter.com/Dl3LXDGF7t Hammill said congressional requests for Capitol-flown flags are ""a daily thing."" A decades-old program operated by the Architect of the Capitol lets people purchase flags for a price through their representatives in Congress and fly them over the Capitol. The program started in 1937 when a member of Congress asked for a flag that had flown over the Capitol, according to the Architect of the Capitol’s website. The program gets about 100,000 flag requests from Congress each year, the website says.  Pelosi’s office website has a page devoted to flag requests. It says they can be made on a specific date and in honor of a specific person, event or organization.  ""Members can fly a flag for any reason they want,"" Hammill said. ""Typically, it is something that is requested quite frequently by constituents, but members themselves can also initiate the request in order to honor an occasion, a family member who passes away."" Pelosi requested the flag for Floyd and was within her authority to do so, Hammill said. ""It is not a service flag. It is a flag flown over the Capitol,"" he said, adding that the Capitol-flown flags are not ""reserved to the military"" and the attacks on Pelosi are ""way off-base."" Members of Congress can also give Capitol-flown flags to the families of firefighters, law enforcement officers, ambulance crews and other first responders according to the Fallen Heroes Flag Act of 2016. The law specifies that such flags should be furnished at no cost to the family.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, which declined to comment, provides no-cost burial flags to adorn the caskets or urns of deceased veterans who served in the armed forces. The provision of a flag to honor a death has therefore ""come to represent a veteran funeral rite,"" said John Raughter, a spokesman at the American Legion, a veterans association. The action Pelosi took is unrelated. The U.S. Flag Code, a set of guidelines for respecting the flag, does not ""prohibit or limit a flag draping the coffin to any specific group,"" Raughter said. ""Additionally, there is no rule about who may receive a flag as a gift."" ""Presenting someone with a flag folded into a triangle and placed into a display case is an honorable way of presenting and maintaining the flag of the United States,"" he said. A headline said, ""Speaker Pelosi presents a special ‘service flag’ to Mr. Floyd’s family."" Pelosi honored George Floyd by presenting his brother with an American flag that had flown over the Capitol. The flag was not a ""special service flag,"" nor was the action out of the ordinary. American flags are not reserved for honoring military veterans or first responders who died on the job, although they are customarily provided at no cost to the families of such individuals. Members of Congress can request Capitol-flown flags through the Architect of the Capitol.  Waynedupree.com has since changed the headline to remove the word ""service.""

Photo shows NASCAR drivers ‘kissing the bricks,’ not participating in a Muslim prayer

Since then, winners of various races at the speedway have done the same.

Trump’s take on COVID testing gives short shrift to public health realities
","President Donald Trump sought to downplay the numbers associated with COVID-19 in the United States — which have passed 2 million confirmed cases and are nearing 120,000 lives lost — by arguing that the soaring national count was simply the result of superior testing. ""If you don't test, you don't have any cases,"" Trump said at a June 15 roundtable discussion at the White House. ""If we stopped testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any."" It’s a talking point the administration is emphasizing. Vice President Mike Pence reiterated it during a phone call to Republican governors that evening, recommending they use the argument as a strategy to quiet public concern about surging case tallies in some states. It’s also a variation on a tweet the president sent earlier in the day. With that in mind, we wanted to dig deeper. We reached out to the White House for comment or clarification, but we never heard back. Independent researchers told us, though, that the president’s remarks are not only misleading — they’re also counterproductive in terms of thinking through what’s needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Essentially, the president is arguing that the United States is finding more cases of COVID-19 because we are testing more – and our increased testing makes it look like we have a worse epidemic than other countries do. ""We will show more — more cases when other countries have far more cases than we do; they just don’t talk about it,"" he added. But that isn’t true. The numbers paint a stark picture. The United States has recorded 2.1 million cases of the novel virus so far, about a quarter of the global total and more than any other country. To Trump’s point, the country is testing more now than it did at the start of the outbreak — per capita, the U.S. is in the top 20% of countries when it comes to cumulative tests run. But this beefed up testing is still likely undercounting. The problem is that the U.S. outbreak is worse than that of many other countries – so we need to be testing a higher percentage of our population than do others. A way to understand this: the number of tests necessary to identify a positive case. If it’s easier to find a positive case, that suggests the virus has spread further and more testing is necessary to track the spread of COVID-19. For instance, statistics from the United States and the United Kingdom are fairly similar in terms of how many coronavirus tests are done daily per million people. But those tests yield far more positive cases in the United States. That suggests the outbreak here requires more per-capita testing than does the U.K.’s. ""We have a much bigger epidemic, so you have to test more proportionately,"" said Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Put another way, a larger health crisis means — even after controlling for population size — the United States will have to test more people to find out where and how the virus has spread. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) And while the U.S. has ramped up its testing since March, many parts of the country still don’t have sufficient systems in place — from facilities to staff to medical supplies — for diagnosing COVID-19, researchers told us. And what about the president’s assertion that ""if we stopped testing right now, we’d have very few cases"" or none at all? On its literal phrasing, it’s absurd, experts said. ""The implication that not testing makes the problem go away is completely false. It could not be more false,"" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. That’s because testing doesn’t create instances of the virus — it is just a way of showing and tracking them. (The president made a similar point during the same White House roundtable event.) But even if you take it figuratively – the idea that our expanded testing resources have inflated our sense of the epidemic – it’s still misleading. ""We’re seeing a lot of cases because we’re testing? It just doesn’t ring true,"" Kates said. ""The U.S. has made a lot of progress for sure. But that job is not finished."" The president’s claim is part of a larger re-election strategy, argued Robert Blendon, a health care pollster at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The idea is to suggest that the health crisis is mostly exaggerated – and that things are getting better, and Americans should feel comfortable going back to work. ""If the economy takes off, the president has a chance of re-election,"" Blendon said. ""If it contracts as a result of expansion of cases, and the only way we know how to respond is restriction of economic activity, he’s gone."" But the problem, Blendon added, is that COVID-19 counts are still climbing in multiple states. And people are still dying of the virus. That gets at another point: Diagnostic testing isn’t the only data source to reveal the pandemic’s existence. Let’s not forget about hospitalization rates and death counts. The number of deaths continues to rise, and hospitalizations are higher than they would be in the virus’s absence.  Trump argued that the nation’s high count of COVID-19 cases is simply a result of our expanded testing capacity. His point is entirely incorrect. The most relevant data suggests that the U.S. isn’t testing enough to match the severity of the pandemic. Even with our higher testing ratio, we’re probably still undercounting compared to other countries. Testing doesn’t create the virus. Even without diagnostics, COVID-19 would still pose a problem. We just would know less about it. And in fact, eliminating testing may alter the public’s perception of the pandemic, but it wouldn’t conceal it. If anything, it would likely worsen the crisis, since the public health system wouldn’t know how to accurately track and prevent the spread of the virus. The claim has no merit and seriously misrepresents the severity of the public health crisis. We rate it Pants on Fire.","[('CSPAN, ""President Trump Roundtable Discussion on Seniors,"" June 15, 2020', 'https://www.c-span.org/video/?473086-1/president-trump-speaks-reporters-white-house'), ('The New York Times, ""Pence Tells Governors to Repeat Misleading Claim on Outbreaks,"" June 15, 2020', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Emily Gurley, associate scientist in epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, June 16, 2020', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/world/coronavirus-usa-world.html?campaign_id=60&emc=edit_na_20200615&instance_id=0&nl=breaking-news&ref=headline&regi_id=57051614&segment_id=30993&user_id=d338c89be23e83b2fc4636737eaa99d9'), ('Our World in Data, Coronavirus Pandemic Data Explorer, accessed June 16, 2020', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2020/jun/17/donald-trump/trumps-take-covid-testing-gives-short-shrift-publi/

Maryland July 4th safety guidelines poster is fake
","A faux notice about Independence Day safety guidelines supposedly issued by the Maryland state government has some Marylanders pretty angry.  It’s making the rounds on social media and contains some pretty bizarre and harsh rules for July 4th festivities, such as:  ""Each citizen will not be allowed more than two sparklers for the day.

Social Distancing must be practiced as always, for safety purposes. Hugging, kissing or touching of any kind will not be permitted. Failure to comply may result in multiple fines up to $1,200 to be assessed per occurrence.""

We found no official 2020 safety guidelines for July 4th on the Maryland state government website. And the Maryland State Fire Marshal released a June 16 statement saying this notice is indeed fake:  ""The author would have the reader believe Governor Hogan has issued a directive on a specific way to handle sparklers as well as a limited time celebrating outdoors. This poster is simply fake and was produced without the authority of the Governor's Office or the Office of the State Fire Marshal. We would not direct citizens on a specific time to be outside and recommend the latest CDC guidelines on how to properly socially distance. Due to complications of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for social distancing, many applicants have elected to not hold most outdoor displays, however, citizens are permitted to use legal fireworks in approved areas.
