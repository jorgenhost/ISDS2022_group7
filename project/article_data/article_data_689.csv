Blogger mangles info on African electrification aid project
","Critics of American foreign aid often say the dollars are wasted. Daniel Greenfield, a fellow with the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a conservative think tank, put that argument at the top of an article that appeared on one of the center’s websites. ""Obama spent $7 billion to bring electricity to Africa, failed miserably,"" went the headline in Greenfield’s piece, which was originally published July 31, 2015, but has continued to make the rounds. Greenfield then offered a copy-and-paste of several paragraphs from an op-ed written by two researchers at the University of California-Berkeley. Their point was that even if African nations were able to produce more power, millions of people would still lack service because the electric grid doesn’t reach them. We’ll get to problems of the grid and reliability in a bit, but the larger issue, and the focus of this fact-check, is whether the Obama administration has actually spent $7 billion to boost electric capacity in Africa. We reached out to Greenfield and did not hear back. The Power Africa initiative In June 2013, President Barack Obama unveiled Power Africa, a broad partnership among many donors, private companies and Sub-Saharan African nations to double access to power in the region. The lack of reliable service, or simply any electricity at all, is a major stumbling block to enterprise in this part of the world. According to the International Energy Agency which represents 29 countries dependent on foreign oil, two-thirds of the people in Sub-Saharan Africa don’t have power. Obama’s initiative aims to add 10,000 megawatts of generating capacity and make electricity more available to 20 million households and businesses. To make that happen, the administration said it would commit more than $7 billion over five years. The lion’s share of the total -- $5 billion -- would come from the Export-Import Bank, which offers both direct loans and insurance to back-up the deals American companies make with overseas buyers. Another government body, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, would provide about $1.5 billion in direct loans or loan guarantees to do much the same thing. For example, if General Electric built power plants in Ghana, Ghana would be required to pay for the project, and U.S. insurance would make sure General Electric got its money should Ghana fall short. The Power Africa initiative is the starting point for statements about Obama spending $7 billion on electric projects in Africa. The key flaw in Greenfield’s assertion is the program has been slow to get off the ground. When Greenfield wrote his piece, only about a quarter of the total funds had been committed. The status of Power Africa According to the U.S. Agency for International Development, as of August 2015, about $1.7 billion in aid had been obligated. That includes over $1 billion in project financing aid from the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and about $600 million in technical assistance from USAID. Whether all of that $1.7 billion (or $2.1 billion if you include a new project announced in October) represents actual spending lies somewhat in the eye of the beholder. The Export-Import Bank generates a return on its loans and its default rate is low. In 2014, it delivered over $670 million in profits to the U.S. Treasury. Point being, money comes back. But even under the broadest definition of spending, Power Africa has spent much less than half of its earmarked money while it’s now about two and a half years into a five-year effort. Deborah Brautigam directs the International Development Program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Brautigam told PolitiFact that a big part of the problem was the congressional battle in 2014 over reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank. ""When Congress didn’t reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank, they couldn’t initiate any new projects,"" Brautigam said. Some Republicans criticized the bank as a case of the government picking winners and losers, which was out of step with free-market principles. The bank’s authorization lapsed at the end of September 2014, and a deal to put it back in business didn’t emerge until December 2015. Another problem was Power Africa relies on private companies to decide it makes sense to invest in a given African country. Brautigam said the government can’t force firms to move forward. Producing power vs. getting it to people The op-ed piece that Greenfield cited was focused on a specific part of the electricity puzzle in Africa. The challenge isn’t simply to generate electricity. The power grid to move it around is sorely underdeveloped, too. The researchers who wrote that item studied the situation in Kenya. They found that just 30 percent of Kenyans are connected to the grid, and in rural areas, only 5 percent of households and 20 percent of businesses within a half-mile of the grid are connected. They didn’t criticize Power Africa so much as describe its limitations. Co-author Edward Miguel, an economist at the University of California-Berkeley, said Greenfield’s piece distorted the Kenyan research. ""It is a bit disappointing, to say the least, when someone runs with your research and writing and grossly misinterprets it,"" Miguel said. ""I would prefer for Power Africa to focus on some different areas, but much of the funding appears to be going into investments that are useful."" Rudy Gharib, spokewoman for Power Africa, said many of the early projects focused on boosting generating capacity ""because of the long lead time needed to get those deals online and because most countries are facing capacity shortages and it is not possible to connect large numbers of new customers without addressing the issue of there not being enough power on the grid."" Our ruling Greenfield said that Obama had spent $7 billion and failed to bring electricity to Africa. The projected dollar total was correct, but the statement missed the reality that as of August 2015, only about $1.7 billion had been committed. And a lot of the money that will be committed will be in the form of loans or loan guarantees, not gifts. How can you declare failure on a project that isn't yet completed? We rate this claim Pants on Fire.","[('Frontpage, Obama spent $7 billion to bring electricity to Africa, failed miserably, July 30, 2015', 'http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/259639/obama-spent-7-billion-bring-electricity-africa-daniel-greenfield'), ('White House Press Office, Fact sheet: Power Africa, June 30, 2013', 'No link'), ('U.S. Agency for International Development, Power Africa, Nov. 10, 2015', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/30/fact-sheet-power-africa'), ('International Energy Agency, Energy access database, 2015', 'No link'), ('New York Times, Obama’s ‘Power Africa’ Project Is Off to a Sputtering Start, July 21, 2015', 'https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica'), ('Reuters, Despite $7 billion to ‘Power Africa,’ why the continent is still in the dark, June 30, 2015', 'No link'), ('U.S. House Financial Services Committee, Majority staff memorandum: Reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, June 20, 2014', 'http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/energydevelopment/energyaccessdatabase/'), ('Bloomberg, U.S. Export-Import Bank, Dec. 1, 2015', 'No link'), ('AidData, U.S. aid to Africa: Electricity - 2001-2013, Jan. 14, 2016', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/world/africa/obamas-power-africa-project-is-off-to-a-sputtering-start.html?_r=0'), ('Interview, Rudy Gharib, director of communications, Power Africa, USAID,\xa0Jan. 14, 2016', 'No link'), ('Interview, Deborah Brautigam, professor of international development, Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies,\xa0Jan. 7, 2016', 'http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/07/30/despite-a-7-billion-pledge-to-power-africa-why-the-continent-is-still-in-the-dark/'), ('Email interview, Edward Miguel, professor of environmental and resource economics, University of California-Berkeley, Jan. 21, 2016', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2016/feb/11/daniel-greenfield/blogger-mangles-info-african-electification-aid-pr/

Hillary Clinton says Johnson Controls got federal bailout money, now avoiding paying federal taxes
","In late 2015, Johnson Controls Inc. absorbed a wave of unwelcomed headlines after a federal prosecutor said its CEO offered to pay $20 million restitution on behalf of a notorious Ponzi schemer. The world's leading maker of car batteries, and a manufacturer of heating and cooling equipment and controls, wasn’t used to such sensational stuff. Then on Feb. 4, 2016 -- less than two weeks after Johnson Controls announced it would move its headquarters from suburban Milwaukee to Cork, Ireland, as part of a merger with Tyco International -- the typically low-key company was smacked again, on national television, by Hillary Clinton. At an MSNBC-hosted presidential debate in New Hampshire, Clinton criticized Johnson Controls as something of a pork barreling tax evader. Alluding to her rival for the Democratic nomination, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton said: ""Look at what I am proposing, and — we have a vigorous agreement here. We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street. ""I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an auto parts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes."" The next Democratic debate is Feb. 11, 2016 in Johnson Controls’ home territory, hosted by PBS at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. And it’s possible we’ll hear a repeat of Clinton’s attack. So let’s assess of both parts her claim. Bailbout background Clinton’s reference to a bailout was a bit muddled. Unlike big automakers, Johnson Controls wasn’t facing bankruptcy back in 2008. But it did benefit -- indirectly -- from a federal bailout of the auto industry. As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported a week before Clinton made her claim: Johnson Controls Inc. was as patriotic as they come back in 2008, when the U.S. auto industry was teetering on bankruptcy and the company knew it desperately needed help from U.S. taxpayers. The company's president at the time, Keith Wandell, didn't hesitate to ask Congress to support the massive government bailout that ultimately rescued two major U.S. automakers, along with uncounted businesses that provide parts and services to them. ""It saved a whole lot of suppliers that would have gone out of business,"" said Steve Roell, then Johnson Controls' chief executive. In 2008, of course, the entire auto industry was in very bad shape as the recession took hold. Layoffs at auto plants and among auto parts suppliers were on track to reach 250,000 workers. General Motors was virtually out of cash to pay its bills and Chrysler was not far behind. In December 2008, President George W. Bush used $17.6 billion in TARP money to keep GM and Chrysler afloat. And in 2009, President Barack Obama continued the rescue of the two automakers that was financed with about $80 billion in taxpayer money. Clinton’s campaign notes that the Obama White House has touted the importance of the auto bailout beyond General Motors and Chrysler. In a statement in 2011 that mentioned Johnson Controls, the White House said: GM and Chrysler were supported by a vast network of auto suppliers, which employed three times as many workers and depended on the auto companies business to survive. An uncontrolled liquidation of a major automaker would have had a cascading impact throughout the supply chain, causing failures and job loss on a larger scale. Johnson Controls, meanwhile, has acknowledged that Wandell had ""encouraged the Congress to support the automakers, noting that failure of even one of them would have devastating consequences for many U.S. suppliers."" But the company emphasized that it did not receive any of the auto bailout money. So, while the money went to the automakers, part of the intent was to help businesses that supply them, as well. The taxes As we noted, Johnson Controls itself has said that the move of its headquarters to Ireland will save $150 million per year in taxes. With the so-called inversion -- in this case, Johnson Controls relocating its headquarters outside the U.S. through being acquired by Tyco -- lets a company pay corporate income taxes on its overseas earnings at the tax rate of its new home country. At 35 percent, the United States’ statutory corporate rate -- that is, before deductions -- is the highest among developed countries. In Ireland, the corporate tax rate is 12.5 percent. Clinton, Sanders and others have decried inversions, while some Republicans, including Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, have said the moves are evidence that corporate tax rates in the United States are too high. New York Times commentator Andrew Ross Sorkin, while lamenting the inversions, has said: ""Ultimately, the only way inversions will stop is when the corporate tax code changes so it becomes more attractive for American companies to be American companies. A Johnson Controls spokesman did not respond to our requests for comment. The company has said its move was not a tax-driven transaction, but was being done for strategic reasons, with the aim of the merger with Tyco being ""to build the best industrial company we can."" But the company hasn’t disputed the tax benefits. Our rating Clinton said ""we bailed out"" Johnson Controls when ""we saved the auto industry"" and ""now they want to avoid paying taxes."" Johnson Controls was not a direct recipient of the 2008-’09 federal bailouts of the auto industry, but it did push for the funds and, as an auto parts supplier, benefited indirectly. On federal taxes, the company has said it will save $150 million per year by moving its headquarters from suburban Milwaukee to Ireland. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.","[('Federal News Service, debate transcript, Feb. 4, 2016', 'http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/us/politics/transcript-of-the-democratic-presidential-debate.html?referer=https://www.google.com/'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""After getting taxpayers’ help, Johnson Controls packs its bags,"" Jan. 30, 2016', 'No link'), ('The White House, auto bailout statement, June 2011', 'http://www.jsonline.com/business/after-getting-taxpayers-help-johnson-controls-packs-its-bags-b99660610z1-367111901.html'), ('New York Times, ""A tidal wave of corporate migrants seeking (tax) shelter,"" Jan. 25, 2016', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact National, ""Did President Obama save the auto industry,"" Sept. 6, 2012', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/auto_report_06_01_11.pdf'), ('Johnson Controls, statement on auto bailout funds, Feb. 4, 2016', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2016/feb/11/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-johnson-controls-got-federal-/

Jeb Bush says his two picks for Florida Supreme Court have been 'its most consistent conservatives'
","Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s positions on some issues, such as immigration, have been to the left of other members of the GOP presidential field. But last month, Bush laid down a marker on his own conservatism: his selection of conservative judges. ""I have a proven record of appointing conservatives to the Florida judiciary as governor, and my administration devoted substantial time to vetting nominees,"" Bush wrote in an article for Medium. ""We sought judges who had shown humility, courage, an appreciation of the duties of a judge, a respect for the will of the people, and devotion to full application of the law without equivocation. My two appointments to the Florida Supreme Court, Raul Cantero and Kenneth Bell, have earned reputations as its most consistent conservatives. Additionally, two of the appellate judges I named as governor, Charles Canady and Ricky Polston, are now serving with distinction on the Florida Supreme Court."" We wondered whether Bush was right that Cantero and Bell ""have earned reputations as its most consistent conservatives."" Our research suggests that Bush has a point, though the case is stronger for Bell than for Cantero. Some preliminaries We will note that Bush’s Medium article misspelled Cantero’s first name. It’s actually Raoul. Second, due to a grammatical misfire, what Bush wrote was somewhat misleading. Saying that Bell and Cantero ""have earned reputations as (the court’s) most consistent conservatives"" suggests that Bell and Cantero continue to serve as justices. That’s not the case -- both left the court to take positions in the private sector in 2008, almost eight years ago. Though Bush can hardly be blamed for their early departures from the court, it does mean that his successor, Charlie Crist, got to nominate their replacements. As it happens, though, their replacements were Canady and Polston -- the two other judges whose appointments Bush takes credit for in the Medium article. About the Florida Supreme Court Though Republicans have long had strong majorities in the Florida Legislature and haven’t lost a gubernatorial race in the state since 1994, the state Supreme Court has been a somewhat surprising bulwark for Democrats in recent years. The last Democratic governor, Lawton Chiles, appointed three of the seven members in 1997 and 1998 -- Barbara Pariente, Fred Lewis and Peggy Quince. Quince’s appointment was complicated; Chiles chose her, but due to the timing of judicial and gubernatorial terms, Bush ended up being the one to officially install her. (Bush’s role in the appointment of Quince -- who’s seen as a liberal -- may muddy his conservative bona fides to some, but the scenario was such an unusual one that we’ll set it aside in this analysis.) The other four justices currently on the court were named by Crist, who was elected as a Republican but later became an independent while in office and ultimately made an unsuccessful run for governor as a Democrat in 2014. Crist’s two picks from the early part of his tenure -- Canady and Polston -- are generally considered to be conservatives. His two later picks, Jorge Labarga and James Perry, are generally considered moderate to liberal. All told, then, under its current makeup, the Florida Supreme Court tends to lean moderate to liberal -- certainly more so than either chamber of the Legislature or the current governor, Republican Rick Scott. In fact, under the current court, 5-2 decisions -- with conservatives Canady and Polston in the minority -- have become rather common. Notably, the court -- with Canady and Polston in dissent -- has taken an aggressive stance on redrawing legislative and congressional districts that had been drawn by Republicans. Bell and Cantero in context We found general agreement that both Bell and Cantero were conservative, though Cantero perhaps less ""consistent"" than Bell, to use Bush’s word. On the one hand, when Cantero stepped down, the Tampa Bay Times called him ""one of the high court’s two most conservative judges."" The Associated Press called him ""one of its most conservative members."" The Ocala Star-Banner called the two justices ""reliable conservative voices,"" noting their dissents in a 5-2 decision in 2006 that overturned a school voucher program supported by Bush. In 1993, Cantero wrote a letter to the editor of the Miami Herald that defended anti-abortion protesters, saying, ""Abortions kill children,"" the Times reported. The Bush campaign also pointed us to a web posting by the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative legal advocacy group that described Bell and Cantero as ""widely regarded as conservative in their judicial philosophies."" On the other hand, Cantero had an ""unpredictably independent"" streak, the Times wrote on his retirement: ""He blasted a Bush privatization measure, in which private attorneys with little-to-no criminal law experience were being hired to replace public defenders for death row inmates. Cantero called their performance some of ‘the worst lawyering I've seen.’ "" Indeed, the death penalty is probably the issue on which Cantero has deviated most from traditional conservatism. Cantero authored the majority opinion of State of Florida vs. Steele (2005), which ruled that unanimity should be required for jury recommendations of death sentences. Bush expressed openness to the idea, but the Legislature never acted, and hasn’t since. Indeed, from the private sector, Cantero has continued to urge unanimity in death penalty cases, including a 2012 Miami Herald op-ed he co-wrote. Cantero also joined a unanimous decision -- along with Bell -- to overturn a law supported by Bush and the Legislature to reinsert a tube into Terri Schiavo, a brain-damaged patient whose case became a cause celebre, especially for some social conservatives. ""It was a proud moment for us that we were able to reach a unanimous decision,"" Cantero told the Associated Press at the time. ""We were able to work through the issues dispassionately."" Our ruling Bush said, ""My two appointments to the Florida Supreme Court, Raul Cantero and Kenneth Bell, have earned reputations as its most consistent conservatives."" Bell and Cantero were certainly the most conservative members of the court when they were serving on it. However, Bush could have phrased his statement more carefully, to avoid suggesting that they are still on the court. Also, Cantero did sometimes break ranks with the traditionally conservative position, such as on the death penalty. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.","[('Jeb Bush, ""Realigning the Courts with the Constitution"" (Medium post), Jan. 24, 2016', 'https://medium.com/@JebBush/realigning-the-courts-with-the-constitution-dfe01ef2ff46#.93fqsfidm'), ('Florida Supreme Court, list of justices, accessed Feb. 10, 2016', 'No link'), ('Judicial Crisis Network, Jeb Bush page, accessed Feb. 9, 2016', 'http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/justices/index.shtml'), ('Raoul Cantero and Mark R.

Is Donald Trump self-funding his campaign? Sort of
","President Donald Trump wouldn’t be beholden to special interests, he says. Why? Because billionaires aren’t paying for his campaign. ""You know a lot of times you see these really dumb deals,"" he said of current political leaders at an Iowa rally Feb. 1. ""And you'll say that's dumb. It doesn't make sense. But then when you think, it does make sense because these politicians are representing interests, whether it's a country or a company, where doing the stupid deals actually makes sense only for that politician and for that company or country."" In contrast, Trump said, ""I'm self-funding my own campaign. It's my money."" Trump talks about self-funding his own campaign almost every day, it seems, so it’s about time we put it on the Truth-O-Meter. The fact is, Trump’s campaign isn’t 100 percent self-funded. He receives a significant amount of individual donations. But he does have a point that he puts up a lot of his own money, especially compared with other candidates (and that big-money donors are largely staying away). Contributions Trump’s campaign brought in about $19.4 million by the end of 2015. Trump contributed nearly $13 million of that himself. Most of the remainder comes from individual contributions, which federal law caps at $2,700 per candidate per election.  Trump is contributing much, much more of his personal wealth than any other presidential contender. The only other candidates contributing to their own campaigns are: retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has so far reported contributing $25,000; former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at $368,147; and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at $388,720. Although a significant portion of his campaign funds, about 34 percent, come from individual contributions, Trump doesn’t appear to be actively soliciting these donations with high-profile fundraising events. The Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for transparency in money in politics, tracks political fundraisers with its Political Party Time tool. It has no record of any events to benefit Trump. In contrast, Political Party Time has recorded more than 280 fundraisers for Clinton and more than 150 for Bush since the start of 2015. There is, though, a ""donate"" button on Trump’s website. Trump also has minimal political action committee support compared with his opponents. PACs have raised just $1.8 million on Trump’s behalf, which is the lowest among all candidates still in the race, with the exception of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Republican former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, whose PAC fundraising for both candidates remains at $0. Trump seems to be friendly with at least one PAC created in his honor. He attended a New York fundraiser hosted by the Make America Great Again PAC in July and said he’s grateful for their support, reported Politico. The group also received a $100,000 donation from the in-laws of Trump’s daughter Ivanka. The PAC shut down in October following allegations that it coordinated with Trump’s campaign. Big asterisks It’s worth noting a couple more caveats. First, Trump’s self-financing only really picked up in the last three months of 2015. From the start of his campaign in April through October last year, individual contributions made up about 67 percent of total money raised for his campaign. Other media outlets who looked at this claim before the most recent FEC filings concluded that Trump’s claim was inaccurate because, at the time, most of his funding was coming from individual contributions. But in the last quarter, Trump gave his campaign a $10.8 million loan, turning that balance around. That brings us to the second caveat: The vast majority of Trump’s contributions to his own campaign — about $12.6 million — are loans rather than donations. This means he could expect to eventually recoup these funds. Further, of the approximately $12 million Trump’s campaign spent in 2015, about $2.7 million went toward reimbursing Trump-affiliated companies for services provided to the campaign, such as traveling in his own plane and helicopter, according to a New York Times analysis. On whether Trump should describe his campaign as self-funded, given these caveats, it’s ""sort of a judgment call,"" said Viveca Novak, editorial and communications director at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. ""To me, it would be more accurate to say he was ‘partially self-funding,’ "" Novak added. Trump’s claim is accurate in part, but it needs a big asterisk, said Richard Skinner, a policy analyst at the Sunlight Foundation. He added that all self-funders take at least some individual contributions, noting in particular former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s 2008 primary run. Romney provided about 44 percent of his campaign’s total funds raised, while about 56 percent came from individual donations. Rick Hasen, an expert in election and campaign finance law at the University of California Irvine, disagrees. ""I don't think it is fair to say that a person is self-funding if a significant share of those contributions come from someone other than the candidate,"" he said. ""Nor do I think a candidate who loans money to his campaign, but who expects to be paid back by the campaign, is fairly characterized as self-funding."" It’s possible that Trump’s intent to self-fund his campaign could result in a president that feels less indebted to billionaires' special interests, as Trump claims, Skinner noted. But even if he isn’t taking their money, they still might have influence on Trump. ""One critique of fundraising, it makes you spend a lot of time around very rich people, and Trump clearly already does that,"" Skinner said. Our ruling Trump said, ""I'm self-funding my own campaign."" As of the end of 2015, Trump’s own contributions account for more than half of all money the campaign has taken in. He’s contributed far more of his own money than any other candidate this cycle. However, a significant portion of his money comes from individual contributions. For several months last year, the campaign received far more dollars from potential voters than they did from Trump. Additionally, most of Trump’s contributions have been loans rather than donations, so he may hope to recoup those funds. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.","[('FEC, Donald Trump 2016 cycle report summaries, through Dec. 31, 2015', 'http://politicalpartytime.org/calendar/'), ('Open Secrets, Donald Trump Candidate Summary, 2016 Cycle, accessed Feb. 9, 2016', 'No link'), ('Sunlight Foundation, Political Party Time tool, accessed Feb. 9, 2016', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/us/politics/donald-trumps-campaign-billed-as-self-funded-risks-little-of-his-fortune.html?_r=0'), ('New York Times, ""Donald Trump’s Campaign, Billed as Self-Funded, Risks Little of His Fortune,"" Feb. 5, 2016', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""Which Presidential Candidates Are Winning the Money Race,"" Feb. 1, 2016', 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/election-2016-campaign-money-race.html'), ('NBC, ""Trump Is Self-Funding Majority of His Campaign for the First Time,"" Feb, 1, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Center for Responsive Politics spokeswoman Viveca Novak, Feb. 9, 2016', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-ups-personal-spending-campaign-even-polls-go-his-way-n508311'), ('PolitiFact, ""Is Bernie Sanders the only presidential candidate without a super PAC?""

""Over the last two centuries, the federal Congress has steadily expanded its reach into every nook and cranny of every Americans' life — and kicked the states to the curb in the process,"" Abbott said. Among examples, Abbott elaborated: ""While states used to have regulatory power over fishing, federal law now regulates down to the tenth of the inch the minimum size of fish that anglers can keep."" Anyone who fishes knows about minimum lengths. The rules are aimed at preventing anglers from removing young fish before they’ve had time to reproduce. So, have the feds really pushed the states aside as the arbitrator of minimum fish lengths down to the tenth of an inch? Abbott’s info  In an email, Abbott spokesman John Wittman responded to our inquiry by pointing out a federal law providing minimum length limits for certain kinds of fish caught in ocean waters at issue in a federal case brought against Florida fisherman John Yates in 2007. The case made news when it hit the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015, though the justices weren’t weighing the fish-length rules, according to a Feb. 26, 2015, New York Times news story; they were deciding whether Yates destroyed evidence of a crime when he dumped the fish overboard after a Florida state Fish and Wildlife officer working on behalf of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration measured them and found them too short. Wittman told us the officer determined that 72 of Yates’ red grouper measured between 18.75 and 19.75 inches — below the 20-inch minimum. Wittman said the officer was ""thus, charging Mr. Yates with violating federal fish standard by literally fractions of an inch."" State laws Though Abbott's comments about federal fishing regulations were not limited to Texas alone, it seemed appropriate to begin with the Lone Star State. With Abbott’s backup in hand, we called the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to ask if the federal government sets minimum fish lengths for everyone who fishes in Texas. Department spokesman Josh Havens said by phone that, to the contrary, Texas maintains its own regulations on minimum fish lengths for any catches in public waters. Also, he said, no length regulations apply to fish caught in waters wholly on private lands. Havens said he wasn’t sure when those regulations were first put in place, but that it was before his lifetime. According to the Handbook of Texas, by 1895 ""it had become clear that some regulatory office was needed to control the depletion caused by overfishing,"" so the state established the office of the Fish and Oyster Commissioner. ""By 1962 hunting and fishing activities in 129 counties were under full or partial control of the commission’s regulatory authority,"" the Handbook said. Here are the state-issued minimum length regulations for fish caught in Texas waters, according to the 2015-16 edition of the TPWD Outdoor Annual Hunting and Fishing Regulations:  
Federal laws We wondered still about the Abbott-cited federal case against Yates. At the federal level, NOAA spokeswoman Allison Garrett responded to our inquiry be emailing us links to federal web pages stating that federal fishing law only applies beyond a state’s maritime boundary. For most states, that boundary is three nautical miles offshore though for Texas and Florida, it’s nine miles.     Havens agreed that federal fishery laws only apply outside of state waters. The TPWD website also said federal law ""regulates species between 9 and 200 nautical miles (off Texas shores) under a Federal Fishery Management Plan."" Next, we shared with Wittman our haul of information contradicting the governor’s claim. Wittman replied by email:  ""The point is that this entire area -- water, fish, fishing, etc. -- used to be an area of STATE regulation. Put differently, there were NO federal laws governing fish size. It’s the change from state to federal law that we are complaining about."" History So, did the feds take control over what what the states once controlled? The web pages noted by Garrett laid out some history: The maritime reach of states dates to the time of the founding fathers, the NOAA webpage says, though that reach was never formalized. Rather, the three nautical mile limit was set according the 17th Century ""cannon shot rule,"" which stipulated that the dominion of land ends where the range of weapons ends.    In the 1940s, several states claimed jurisdiction over resources off their coasts, but the U.S. Supreme Court struck that claim down in 1947, saying states had no title to resources off their shores. Congress responded by codifying the maritime reach of states. In 1953 it passed H.R. 5134, giving coastal states jurisdiction over a region extending three nautical miles off their coasts, according to a ""primer on ocean jurisdictions"" posted online by the University of North Texas. That same legislation also established federal control over the vast region geologically defined as the offshore ""continental shelf."" According to the book Shore and Sea Boundaries, ""Congress (in 1953) for the first time asserted jurisdiction over the vast submarine area that fringes our coasts.""  In 1959, the federal government sued the Gulf Coast states, which were attempting to assert more than the three-nautical-mile state maritime reach established in 1953. According to an opinion issued by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1960, Texas was admitted to the Union in 1845 claiming a maritime reach of three leagues (approximately nine nautical miles); that reach was confirmed in the Annexation Resolution of 1845, and could not be nullified or reduced by subsequent legislation, the court wrote. So, Texas maintained its nine-nautical-mile-reach, while most other states were allowed three. Then in 1976, Congress enacted laws establishing a federal fishery conservation zone within 200 nautical miles of U.S. shores, ""with the inner boundary being the seaward boundary of the coastal states,"" according to a summary of legislation on the webpage of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The two compared So, states never actually ceded authority over fishing to federal rules. That is, as state and federal officials told us, the federal rules only pick up where the state’s authority ends, nine miles from the shoreline in the case of Texas. The federal rules do exist. Could they be overbearing and tyrannical anyway? To find out, we put the Texas and federal length limits side by side. They turned out to be generally the same, where applicable. Most federal minimum length limits are slightly shorter, but the feds measure to the inner crest of the fish tail while Texas officials measure to its farthest tip.   Another distinction: Texas regulates more fish species than the feds. Havens said that’s because more fish are fishable in the shallow coastal region than in the deeper federally-regulated portions of the ocean.   Fish species TPWD minimum length (inches) NOAA minimum length for Gulf reef region (inches) Amberjack 34 30 Atlantic sharpnose shark 24 none Banded rudderfish none 14 Bass 18 none Blacktip shark 24 none Bonnethead shark 24 none Catfish, channel and blue 12 none Catfish, flathead 18 none Catfish, gafftopsail 14 none Cobia 37 33 Drum, black 14 none Drum, red 20 none Flounder 14 none Gar, alligator none none Grouper, black none 24 Grouper, gag 22 22 Grouper, goliath catch and release none Grouper, yellowfin none 20 Lesser amberjack none 14 Mackerel, king 27 24 Mackerel, Spanish 14 12 Marlin, blue 131 none Marlin, white 86 none Mullet None none Other allowable sharks 64 none Sailfish 84 none Scamp none 16 Seatrout 15 none Sheepshead 15 none Snapper, lane 8 8 Snapper, red 15 16 Snapper, vermillion 10 10 Snook 24 none Tarpon 85 none Triggerfish, gray 16 14 Tripletail 17 none Federal limits are according to Code of Federal Regulations 622.37, published by Cornell University Law School; state limits are according to Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s Outdoor Annual Hunting and Fishing Regulations. Finally, no minimum lengths - state or federal - were specified to anything more precise than the nearest whole inch, meaning no tenths-of-an-inch restrictions. Our ruling In a January declaration promoting a restoration of powers to the states, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott complained, ""While states used to have regulatory power over fishing, federal law now regulates down to the tenth of the inch the minimum size of fish that anglers can keep."" According to authorities, both the state of Texas and the federal government set minimum lengths for keeping fish caught by anglers. The feds’ authority, however, only begins at nine miles from the coast of Texas, right where the state’s jurisdiction ends. In other words, the federal government has taken no regulatory authority away from the states when it comes to minimum fish lengths. Moreover, since the state of Texas and the federal government both set similar limits specific only to the nearest whole inch, the suggestion the feds’ rules are stricter doesn’t hold water.

Marco Rubio says Hillary Clinton supports abortions 'even on the due date'
","Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who’s known for his strong anti-abortion views, said Hillary Clinton is the extremist when it comes abortion, not him. ""Why doesn’t the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child,"" he said during the Feb. 6 Republican debate in New Hampshire. Is it true that Clinton ""believes all abortions should be legal even on the due date""?   The Rubio campaign didn’t get back to us. So we looked at comments Clinton made on the issue over the past 15 years. Clinton has said she could support restrictions on abortions in the third trimester (about week 28 of a pregnancy) if the mother’s life and health are taken into account. Rubio casts this position as the equivalent of supporting abortions on the due date, but that exaggerates Clinton’s position. Restricting late-term abortions Clinton responded to Rubio’s attack the morning after the debate, calling it ""pretty pathetic."" ""I think that the life and health of the mother, obviously, rape and incest, have to be always taken into account,"" she said on ABC’s This Week. ""And, you know, when he raises the very, very difficult issue of late-term abortion, he conveniently overlooks the fact that there are medical reasons, there are health-related reasons."" We found many instances of Clinton saying abortion should be ""safe, legal and rare."" In short, Clinton is open to restrictions on late-term abortions provided there are exceptions for the life and health of the mother. This includes both mental health and medical complications like preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication of high blood pressure that could lead to death. We should note that those who want a total abortion ban — a position that Rubio has expressed — see exceptions made for rape, incest and health as loopholes that undermine late-term restrictions. Advocating for exceptions could theoretically encompass a due-date abortion, but Rubio’s conclusion that Clinton supports due-date abortions is not backed by evidence and logically unsound. Here’s a sampling of comments Clinton's made in the past: Sept. 28, 2015, Meet the Press Daily: ""There can be restrictions in the very end of the third trimester, but they have to take into account the life and health of the mother."" June 4, 2007, Democratic presidential forum: ""What I have tried to both talk about and reach out about over the last many years, going back, really, at least 15 years, in talking about abortion being safe, legal, and rare. And, by rare, I mean rare."" Oct. 8, 2000, New York Senate debate: ""I have said many times that I can support a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, so long as the health and life of the mother is protected. I’ve met women who faced this heart-wrenching decision toward the end of a pregnancy. Of course it’s a horrible procedure. No one would argue with that. But if your life is at stake, if your health is at stake, if the potential for having any more children is at stake, this must be a woman’s choice."" When abortions can be performed According to the reproductive health nonprofit, the Guttmacher Institute, 20 states limit abortions after ""viability"" (which refers to the point when a fetus can survive out of the womb) and 23 states prohibit abortions between 20 and 28 weeks. Seven states and Washington D.C., have no time restrictions, but this doesn’t mean late-term abortions are common. In fact, only 1.2 percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute.  ""People say we should place legal restrictions on abortion in the third trimester. The reality is the medical community is doing that in practice,"" said Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco and an advisor at Ibis Reproductive Health. ""Third-trimester abortion is very uncommon."" As for the scenario Rubio is suggesting — an abortion performed on the due date to save the life of the mother? It doesn’t exist. ""Nobody would talk about abortion on the woman’s due date. If the mother’s life was at risk, the treatment for that is delivery, and the baby survives,"" Grossman said. ""Medically, it does not compute."" Our ruling Rubio said Clinton ""believes that all abortion should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child."" Clinton does not believe that all abortion should be legal. Instead, she’s said she supports restrictions on late-term abortions except in cases of rape, incest and when the mother’s life and health are in danger. That’s not the same thing as unequivocally supporting abortions ""even on the due date"" of the child. Such an abortion would be a purely hypothetical scenario; doctors said such a procedure doesn't make sense medically. We rate Rubio’s claim False.","[('Washington Post, ""Transcript of the New Hampshire GOP debate, annotated,"" Feb. 6. 2016', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/06/transcript-of-the-feb-6-gop-debate-annotated/'), ('Email interview with Josh Schwerin, spokesman for Hillary Clinton, Feb. 6, 2016', 'No link'), ('CBS, ""Hillary Clinton: Rubio\'s abortion attacks ‘pathetic,’"" Feb. 7, 2016', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-calls-marco-rubios-attacks-on-abortion-pathetic/'), ('ABC, ""\'This Week\' Transcript: Hillary Clinton, Sen.

Bernie Sanders offers overheated claim on where all Republicans stand on climate change
","Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has been contending that all of his Republican opponents are climate change deniers. The matter came up during the Feb. 4 Democratic debate in New Hampshire when Sanders talked about the way money and influence are leveraged to sway political positions. ""Let's talk about climate change,"" he said. ""Do you think there's a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system? Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system? That is what goes on in America."" Not one Republican recognizes that climate change is real? We decided to look at the positions of the GOP candidates who were in the race when Sanders made his statement. The climate change question has several elements. Some candidates acknowledge that Earth's climate has changed in recent decades but insist that natural forces — not human activity — are responsible. Some acknowledge that humans are playing a significant role in climate change but argue that there's little the United States can do by itself to reverse the global warming trend. Others are pushing for specific proposals to address the issue. So where do the Republican candidates stand? Last August, NPR produced a chart showing how all the candidates viewed the various aspects of the climate question. In addition, we repeatedly emailed all the candidates' campaigns to see if that chart was still accurate and whether there were additional nuances that had surfaced in the intervening six months. We heard from the Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina and John Kasich campaigns. Spokespeople for Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Donald Trump didn't respond. We also checked their campaign websites for updated information on how they felt about the climate change question. On the issue of whether climate has been changing significantly in recent decades, Bush, Christie, Fiorina, Kasich and Rubio say that it has. Bush, Christie, Fiorina and Kasich say it's man made. Rubio says it's not. Bush, Christie, Fiorina and Kasich have called for some degree of action to combat it. For example, Christie's campaign sent us comments from an April town hall meeting in Exeter, N.H., where the candidate said, ""I don’t believe we can do this on our own. We have to have cooperation with the rest of the world. If America changes its behavior and puts up with the economic ramifications that will happen from changing that behavior in the short term, the rest of the world has to engage in it with us."" Fiorina's campaign made a similar point, quoting the candidate on CNBC in September as saying that innovation would be the key: ""That's how you're going to solve an intractable problem. It's always the way you solve an intractable problem. Not with regulation — with innovation."" She made the same point during a Nov. 16 town hall meeting. Bush in July said humans have contributed to climate change. ""The climate is changing; I don’t think anybody can argue it’s not,"" Bush told Bloomberg. ""Human activity has contributed to it. I think we have a responsibility to adapt to what the possibilities are without destroying our economy, without hollowing out our industrial core.""   So clearly, some GOP candidates are not denying the problem at all. During the debate, Sanders referred to ""Republicans,"" not the GOP presidential candidates. But two days earlier, at an event in Keene, N.H., he specifically said, ""We do not have one Republican candidate for president acknowledging this (climate change) reality."" Even if he was referring to party supporters in general, a 2013 Pew poll found that 23 percent of people who lean Republican say there is solid evidence that Earth is warming and human activity is responsible. And a 2013 bipartisan poll found that 53 percent of Republican voters under age 35 picked either ""crazy,"" ""ignorant"" or ""out of touch"" to describe someone who denies that climate change is happening. Since those polls, the evidence for warming has only gotten stronger, with NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration saying that Earth’s 2015 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern record keeping began in 1880. When we asked the Sanders campaign about the claim, policy director Warren Gunnels said, ""The reality is that none of the Republicans have introduced a plan to solve climate change in a way that would transform our energy system. ... Go look at all of their websites.  None of them have a plan."" Actually, some of the GOP candidates have posted plans that deal with energy issues, although they don't go in the direction that Sanders and scientists concerned about climate change might like. Bush's website, for example, calls for the repeal or reform of the Carbon Rule, which is President Barack Obama's executive order requiring coal-fired power plants to dramatically reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. Rubio wants to get rid of some anti-pollution rules and use the free market, not government regulation, to encourage ""environmental conservation, fuel efficiency and energy diversity."" Others say little if anything on the issue. Christie's website seems to be silent on the matter. The ""climate change"" section of Kasich's website has a video saying that he cares about the environment. Carson's website simply says, ""Earth is in a constantly cycle of warming or cooling,"" Some are downright hostile. Cruz's website belittles climate change activists and calls for an end to the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and all other sources and an end to the ""regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles."" And Trump's issues page bluntly declares, ""Climate change: It is a hoax,"" a claim worthy of a Pants on Fire. Our ruling Sanders said, ""Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real."" In fact, we found four GOP presidential candidates who have said it is real, it's man-made, and they have offered support for actions to deal with it. Whether their proposed actions — or the actions proposed by Sanders — are the best way of tackling the problem is a matter for debate. We rate Sanders' assertion as False.","[('The Washington Post, ""Sanders-Clinton debate transcript: Annotating what they say,"" Feb. 4, 2016 and ""Cruz: Climate change issue is \'about government power\',"" Feb. 3, 2016', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/04/sanders-clinton-debate-transcript-annotating-what-they-say/#annotations:8631016'), ('Email, Warren Gunnels, policy director, Bernie Sanders campaign, Feb. 5, 2016', 'No link'), ('National Public Radio, ""Where Presidential Candidates Stand On Climate Change,"" Aug. 11, 2015, accessed Feb. 5, 2016', 'http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/11/429781692/where-presidential-candidates-stand-on-climate-change'), ('Bloomberg BNA, ""Jeb Bush Takes Posiitions on Climate Change, EPA Rules, Other Energy Issues,"" July 30, 2015, accessed Feb. 6, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email, Samantha Smith, Chris Christie campaign, Feb. 8, 2016', 'http://www.bna.com/jeb-bush-takes-n17179934073/'), ('Email, Audrey Scagnelli, Carly Fiorina campaign, Feb. 5, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email, Rob Nichols, John Kasich campaign, Feb. 5, 2016', 'https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/05/sen-marco-rubio-believes-in-climate-change-but/'), ('ABC News, ""Sen.

So that means we have 27 countries ahead of us, and yet in terms of cost we're No. 1 by far."" Spending that out-of-proportion to results would throw serious doubt on proposals to boost education budgets, so we decided to check it out. Breaking it down We reached out to Trump’s campaign, but they didn't respond. We consulted data collected by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — an international organization of 34 developed countries — and by the United Nations. Researchers and policymakers from groups across the political spectrum told us they put the most stock in OECD data, which includes spending from both government and private sources. Based on 2012 data, the OECD shows that the United States has generous education budgets, spending about 50 percent more than the average OECD country. But relative to the nation’s overall wealth, the United States was at the middle of the pack. Relative to the size of the economy or overall government spending, U.S. levels were within 1 percent of the OECD average. Additionally, the United States was not the top spender. Luxembourg, Switzerland and Norway each spent more per pupil than the United States. In the case of Luxembourg, about 66 percent more per secondary school student. And similar UN data puts the United States eighth among all countries, behind several other developed countries and Macau, a semi-autonomous city inside China. We looked at a variety of other ways to crunch the numbers, but the United States never rose above No. 4. (see table) That was true even if figures were adjusted for purchasing power, the difference in what $1 buys from country to country. In fact, the United States would have to increase per student spending about $8,000 per year just to match Luxembourg at the high school level. To spend quadruple what Luxembourgers do would require a $70,000 per student boost. U.S. ranking in spending Rank Amount Above average by Below #1 by Below four times #1 by Per student per year (including college) 4 $15,494 51% $7,051 $74,685 Per student primary school 4 $11,030 30% $8,990 $69,050 Per student secondary school 5 $12,442 33% $8,175 $70,026 As percent of GDP 15 4.8% — 2.9% 26% As percent of government spending 14 11.6% — 6.8% 62% Source: OECD Educational achievement So what about us scoring ""No. 28"" among countries in education? There is ample evidence suggesting that U.S. educational performance is sub-par. For instance, the OECD rated the U.S. 23rd out of the 25 countries for the percent of current students going on to pursue higher education. U.S. students were also 30th in math proficiency worldwide according to an OECD test. Meanwhile  U.S. students were about average among developed countries for reading science. Or as Jason Bedrick, a policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, put it: ""The U.S. definitely spends more than most other industrialized nations and has less to show for it."" Our rating Trump said the United States spends more on education per pupil by a factor of four and gets poor results. There is good evidence to support his overall idea, that the United States gets less bang for its education buck than other developed countries. But Trump overstated U.S. spending by 500 percent. We’re not No. 1 in spending, by several different ways of measuring. His comments suggest the country won the gold medal in spending when it’s actually just shy of a bronze. We rate his statement Mostly False.","[('E-mail interview Jason Bedrick, Policy Analyst, Center for Educational Freedom, Cato Institute, Jan. 29, 2016', ' http://www.gao.gov/products/HEHS-95-235'), ('Government Accountability Office, ""Trends in U.S. Education Spending,"" Sept. 15, 1995', 'No link'), ('National Center for Education Statistics, First Look: Revenues and Expenditures for Public Elementary and Secondary Education: School Year 2012-13 (Fiscal Year 2013), Jan. 27, 2016', 'http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2015301'), ('National Center for Education Statistics, The Condition of Education 2015, May 28, 2015', 'No link'), ('National Center for Education Statistics, ""Fast Facts: International comparison of achievement,"" retrieved Feb. 8, 2016', 'http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2015144'), ('Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD Skills Outlook 2015: Youth, skills and employability, May 27, 2015', 'No link'), ('Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, ""skills.oecd: United States."" \xa0Retrieved Feb. 8, 2016', 'https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=1'), ('Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, ""Country Note: United States,"" \xa0retrieved Feb. 8, 2016', 'No link'), ('Education data from United Nations Economic, Social and Cultural Organization Institute for Statistics, retrieved: Feb. 3, 2016', 'https://www.oecd.org/edu/oecd-skills-outlook-2015-9789264234178-en.htm'), ('\xa0', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2016/feb/09/donald-trump/trump-claim-united-states-spends-most-education/

Did JFK answer Vince Lombardi's call to spring Green Bay Packers star for the big game?
","Green Bay Packers fans didn’t need to be reminded that their team wasn’t playing in Super Bowl 50. But the National Football League’s smallest city and its biggest game are inextricably linked. After all, the Vince Lombardi-coached Packers won the first two Super Bowls and the game’s trophy bears Lombardi’s name. So, it wasn't surprising that on Feb. 6, 2016, the day before the big game, the Packers were mentioned during a discussion of Super Bowl trivia on National Public Radio’s ""Weekend Edition."" But what author A.J. Jacobs claimed about the team and President John F. Kennedy sounded surprising, at least to listeners more knowledgeable about politics than Green Bay football. Jacobs was asked by host Scott Simon -- who noted that Super Bowl 50 would be followed in two days by the New Hampshire presidential primary -- if he knew any trivia combining football and politics. Jacobs responded with a story about the NFL Championship Game, which was the game played for all the marbles before the debut in 1967 of what became known as the Super Bowl. Kennedy, according to Jacobs, ""helped the Green Bay Packers win the 1961 NFL championship and beat the New York Giants, which is my team, so I hold a little grudge. ""What happened was, this was 1961, the Berlin Wall crisis was underway. And one of the Green Bay Packers' star players had been called away on military duty. He was a reservist."" Lombardi, who was friends with Kennedy, according to Jacobs, ""called JFK and asked if JFK would release one of the players for the weekend. And JFK did. And the Packers won."" So, did Kennedy release a star Packer from military reserve duty so that he could play in the 1961 NFL title game? Jacobs responded to our inquiry with the alacrity of a defensive player scrambling to pounce on a fumble. To back his claim, the four-time New York Times-bestselling author cited a book by Wisconsin native David Maraniss, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist. In Maraniss’ book, ""When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi,"" Paul Hornung tells the story about how he was able to play in the championship game, despite being put on active duty as a result of the Berlin Crisis, two months earlier. Lombardi had seen Kennedy earlier in the month at a football banquet in New York. Kennedy gave him his private number at the White House and said to call if he ever needed anything. When Lombardi learned that the Christmas leave policy at Fort Riley would keep Hornung in Kansas for the title game, he decided he would use the number. Kennedy then called Fort Riley and authorized that the holiday time off for Private Hornung be changed. It’s worth noting that Hornung, a Pro Football Hall of Fame halfback, has told the story any number of times. The New York Times, the Chicago Tribune and Time magazine are among various media that have relayed how Lombardi pulled strings with Kennedy. So does the Packers team website, noting that Kennedy was said to have said: ""Paul Hornung isn't going to win the war on Sunday, but the football fans of this country deserve the two best teams on the field that day.’"" But there’s more than Hornung’s word. Marannis wrote that ""one document confirms the essence of the transaction."" That was a letter Lombardi later wrote to a top aide of Kennedy's. Lombardi thanked the president for an autographed picture of Kennedy and Lombardi at the football dinner. And he thanked Kennedy for his ""help in obtaining leave for Paul Hornung so he could participate in the Championship game."" Lombardi was understandably grateful that Hornung made it to Lambeau Field for the game. Hornung tallied -- by scoring a touchdown and kicking extra points and field goals -- a record 19 points. The Packers whipped the Giants, 37-0. Our rating Jacobs said Kennedy released a star Green Bay Packer from military reserve duty so that he could play in the 1961 NFL Championship Game. Hornung has repeatedly told the story of how Lombardi made the request of Kennedy, and Kennedy arranged for Hornung to leave his Army post in Kansas in order to play in the game, which the Packers won. Maraniss has cited a letter from Lombardi to a top aide of Kennedy's, thanking the president for making Hornung available to play. We rate Jacobs’ statement True.","[('National Public Radio, ""Weekend Edition"" segment (quote 2:10), Feb. 6, 2016', 'http://www.npr.org/2016/02/06/465819082/would-you-put-money-on-it-test-your-super-bowl-trivia'), ('Email exchange, A.J.

Was college once free in United States, as Bernie Sanders says?
","Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are battling for the ""most progressive"" label in the Democratic presidential primary, and for Sanders that includes his call for free tuition at public colleges and universities. During the Feb. 4 debate in New Hampshire, Sanders argued that there is a precedent for free tuition in the United States and overseas. ""Now, all of the ideas that I'm talking about, they are not radical ideas,"" Sanders said. ""Making public colleges and universities tuition-free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States."" How common is free college tuition worldwide and did it used to exist in the United States? College costs overseas A spokesman for Sanders referred us to a 2014 report from the Organization for Economic Co‑operation and Development, a group that compares data on a variety of topics in advanced industrial nations. We obtained the 2015 report from OECD that showed the number of countries with no tuition as of 2013-14: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Sweden and Turkey. Germany also now has free tuition at public universities, although students pay some fees. ""Yes, it’s free -- it’s the German taxpayer paying for it,"" said Peter Kerrigan, deputy director of German Academic Exchange Service. ""Somebody is footing the bill. It’s just not the student."" For the Nordic countries that charge no tuition, individuals face high income tax rates. The approach to funding higher education ""reflects these countries’ deeply rooted social values, such as equality of opportunity and social equity,"" states an OECD report. College tuition in the U.S. College tuition has never been set on a nationwide basis, said John R. Thelin, professor at the University of Kentucky and author of A History of American Higher Education. Instead, it has been set by each state or college and is subject to approval by the legislature or board of trustees. However, there are examples of some colleges or universities offering free tuition decades ago, especially universities established through federal land grants starting in the 1860s. ""Public colleges and universities were often free at their founding in the United States, but over time, as public support was reduced or not increased sufficiently to compensate for their growth in students and costs (faculty and staff salaries, utilities etc.), they moved first to a low tuition and eventually higher tuition policy,"" said Cornell University professor Ronald Gordon Ehrenberg. For example, California offered free tuition to in-state students until the 1970s, although it charged an ""incidental fee"" starting in 1921. Baruch College in New York was founded in 1847 as the Free Academy, the first free public institution of higher education in the nation, according to the college, which is now part of the City University system of New York. At least some students were paying by the early 20th century, and 1976 marked the end of any tuition-free policy. At the University of Florida, a school catalog from 1905-06 stated: ""No tuition is charged to students whose home is in Florida.  All other students will be required to pay a tuition fee of twenty ($20) dollars per year."" Public higher education was often free when a very small percentage of students attended, said Roger L. Geiger, education professor at Penn State and author of The History of American Higher Education: Learning and Culture from the Founding to World War II. ""Historically, many individual institutions refrained from student charges, including early Stanford. Community colleges were often free, being considered an extension of secondary schools."" he said. In Sanders’ home state at the University of Vermont, a book about the school’s history indicates that tuition was charged in the 19th century. Senior class tuition was $8.34 in 1827. ""I don't think there was ever a time that UVM did not charge tuition,"" said Jeffrey D. Marshall, director of research collections. Sanders talked about public colleges, but we heard about at least one private university that offered free tuition for decades: Rice Institute, later which became Rice University. That university in Texas charged tuition for the first time in 1965. There are also a few small private colleges or universities that are tuition free today, such as Berea College.  Our ruling Sanders said, ""Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States."" There are at least nine advanced countries that offer free college, including the recent addition of Germany. There was a time in the United States when some public colleges and universities charged no tuition. However, tuition has never been set as a national policy -- it is a decision for each school or state government officials. And some colleges charged tuition dating back to the 1800s. Sanders' statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate this statement Mostly True.","[('Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, ""Education at a Glance,"" 2014', 'https://www.oecd.org/edu/education-at-a-Glance-2014.pdf'), ('Good, ""Whatever happened to when college was free?""

No evidence to support rumors tying Zika to genetically modified mosquitoes
","Global health emergencies understandably stoke fear, panic and wild claims. Exaggerations about Ebola were PolitiFact’s 2014 Lie of the Year. And now rumors about Zika, a virus linked to birth defects, are taking the Internet by storm. One of the claims goes something like this: Zika is caused by genetically modified mosquitoes, a testament to what happens when man tampers with nature or a purposefully manufactured weapon for population control. As Snopes and Discover have noted, this idea appears to have originated from a post published Jan. 25 to the subreddit r/conspiracy — our first red flag. But since then, the claim has been circulated by media outlets ranging from Infowars and Natural News to the Daily Mail, the Mirror, Russia Today and Fox News. One version can be found in a popular YouTube video entitled: ""Bioweapon! Zika virus is being spread by GMO mosquitos (sic) funded by Gates."" The video explains that British biotechnology company Oxitec engineered genetically modified mosquitoes to fight the spread of dengue fever and other diseases with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Oxitec recently released these mosquitoes in Brazil, ""where we have this explosion of Zika,"" the video says. ""Writing’s on the wall, folks."" We wondered if there is any truth to the notion that Zika is being spread by transgenic mosquitoes. In a word, no. Epidemiologists told us the rumor is baseless. The mosquitoes in question wouldn’t have been capable of starting the outbreak in 2015, and the geographic correlation offered doesn’t hold up. A spokesperson for the World Health Organization said the organization has seen no evidence suggesting that Zika is linked to genetically modified mosquitoes. ""I don’t know of any scientific evidence for this rumor, or any obvious way to do this that would be more efficient than natural transmission,"" said Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University.   ""I cannot state more emphatically that I believe this theory to be absolutely untrue,"" said Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University. Let’s dissect this claim bit by bit. Not a new disease The claim’s first problem is history. Zika didn’t suddenly appear after genetically modified mosquitoes were released. The virus was first documented nearly seven decades ago in Uganda and has cropped up many times over the years. On April 18, 1947, researchers studying jungle yellow fever isolated the virus from mosquitoes and named it after the Zika Forest where it was found. Though Zika had never been seen before, ""it had probably lurked chronically in African monkeys, or some other native reservoir, for millennia,"" reports National Geographic. In the next half century, evidence of Zika was found in human fluids in a number of African and Asian countries, but only 14 cases of the human disease were documented. Zika was detected outside of the two continents for the first time in 2007. The small island nation of Yap saw 108 confirmed or probable cases of the disease. The second outbreak of Zika hit French Polynesia, another small island in the Pacific, in 2013. About 11 percent of the population (28,000 cases) were infected. In May 2015, Brazil reported the first cases of Zika infection along with a surge in infants born with microcephaly, a birth defect in which baby’s head is abnormally small. There are now an estimated 440,000 to 1.3 million cases in the country and the disease has spread across Latin America. Incapable mosquitoes The claim’s second problem is that genetically modified bugs couldn’t have been responsible for the 2015 Zika outbreak. Many mosquito species in the Aedes genus (africanus, apicoargenteus, luteocephalus, vitattus, furcifer, albopictus, hensilli and polynesiensis) can transmit the Zika virus, but the main vector is Aedes aegypti. This particular mosquito, common in tropical areas around the world, also spreads yellow fever, dengue fever and chikungunya. To combat dengue fever, Oxitec engineered Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to produce a lethal protein and self-destruct. Females, which bite, are destroyed in the lab while males, which don’t bite and thus can’t transmit diseases, are released into the wild. They mate with local, non-GM females and the self-destruct gene is passed onto offspring. Oxitec spokesman Matthew Warren told PolitiFact that the mosquitoes typically self-destruct within one to four days, and the gene disappears from the population about 12 weeks after the initial release. ""This means that offspring of the mosquito do not survive,"" said Durbin of Johns Hopkins. ""Therefore, the progeny of these mosquitoes, even if infected with Zika, would not survive to transmit Zika."" Wrong location The claim’s third problem is the geographic correlation, which besides not being the same thing as causation doesn’t actually match up. The first Brazilian cases of Zika reported in May 2015 were in Camaçari, a district in the northeastern state of Bahia that’s hundreds of kilometers away from the Oxitec trial sites. The biotech firm released the genetically modified mosquitoes in Juazeiro, which is roughly 490 kilometers from Camaçari, and in Jacobina, about 340 kilometers away. It’s also very unlikely, if not impossible, that Zika-carrying Oxitec mosquitoes made their way to Camaçari. For one, the typical Aedes aegypti mosquito can fly a maximum of 200 meters to 440 meters. For another, the trials took place months and years before the Camaçari outbreak (between May 2011 and September 2012 in Juazeiro and in Jacobina between June 2013 and December 2014). So ""even if an Oxitec mosquito ‘hitched a lift,’ "" it would have died long before, Warren said. Beginning in April 2015, Oxitec did release mosquitoes in Piracicaba, in the southeastern state of São Paulo  —  about 2,000 kilometers from Camaçari and 1,900 kilometers from the epicenter of the disease in Recife. According to the state’s department of health, São Paulo has reported only 20 cases of microcephaly as of Jan. 20, 2016 (though there is some suspicion over the official tally) while Piracicaba itself has two confirmed and 12 suspected cases of Zika. Oxitec’s true role in Zika’s rapid spread Rather than spreading Zika, Oxitec mosquitoes could actually help fight the disease, as NPR, CNN, and the New York Times have noted. The self-destructing bugs have reduced virus-carrying mosquito populations in Brazil, Panama and the Cayman Islands by 80 to 90 percent, according to studies commissioned by the company. (Critics say these results are exaggerated.) Experts said the current explosion of Zika in Brazil is more likely due to the lack of barriers, higher population density, increased mobility and novelty of the disease rather than mutant mosquitos. Whereas the disease was confined by the ocean and small populations in Yap and French Polynesia, Durbin pointed out, Zika could spread through a huge amount of territory and infect way more humans in Brazil. Immunity and resistance to the disease has been documented in Nigeria and Indonesia. But in the Americas, Zika is basically a ""virgin soil epidemic,"" said Morse of Columbia. (So were smallpox to Native American populations in the United States and yellow fever to European colonialists in West Africa.) ""I think it’s extremely likely these introductions are inadvertent and not intentional because historically we’ve seen this kind of thing happen many times,"" Morse said. One final note. The viral image focuses part of its criticism on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The foundation helped fund the genetically modified mosquito program. The foundation also is helping support PolitiFact’s efforts to fact-check claims about global health and development. Gates has no input over what we fact-check or the rulings we issue. An Internet rumor propagated in a YouTube video claims that the ""Zika virus is being spread by GMO mosquitos (sic)."" There’s no evidence that this is true. The argument offered — where the Zika outbreak occurred matches up with where the transformed mosquitoes were released — doesn’t hold up. What’s more, the mosquitoes in question were specifically engineered to self-destruct before they can spread viruses. This claim is both inaccurate and ridiculous.

Bono, HIV/AIDS and public opinion: Correcting the record
","Paul David Hewson is best known as Bono, the lead singer of the band U2. But he also is famous for his work to reduce poverty and disease, particularly in Africa. Over the years, Bono has met with presidents and billionaires and has enlisted mainstream retailers to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to combat AIDS. Bono was at the exclusive world economic forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month and pressed the need to continue making progress against AIDS. ""The battle against AIDS is not a last decade issue,"" he told the Irish Times. ""It’s going to be the next decade issue. We need to finish the job, get new companies, new interest. It’s kind of annoying and sometimes upsetting that these global health issues can become creatures of fashion. People think AIDS is done – it’s not done."" That last sentence caught our eye. Does the wider public believe the deadly virus is ""done"" or anything approximating it? Kathy McKiernan, a spokeswoman for Bono’s One group, said Bono was being rhetorical, an argument we can see given the context of his remarks. ""The comment was intended as a wake-up call that there is declining concern about the disease,"" McKiernan said. ""It was not intended to be a literal, global comment that all people think the AIDS crisis is over."" She added that Bono isn’t the only person to worry about shifting public attitudes. In 2009, Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said ""many people think it (HIV) is no longer a problem."" Polling trends are mixed The Kaiser Family Foundation, widely seen as a neutral source of health data, has followed American thinking on HIV/AIDS for many years. In 2012, Kaiser asked people to name the most urgent health problem facing the world. The largest number of people -- 41 percent -- said cancer. But then there was a second-tier group of diseases -- heart disease, HIV/AIDS, obesity and diabetes -- that were named by between 15 to 17 percent of the public. So HIV/AIDS ranked high but not the highest. In earlier surveys, more Americans thought AIDS was a bigger issue. In Kaiser’s 2004 poll, 36 percent picked HIV/AIDS as the most urgent problem, just a few percentage points behind cancer. In 2009, the fraction was 21 percent. To Jennifer Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at Kaiser, the trend is clear.  Source: Kaiser Family Foundation/Roper Center for Public Opinion Research ""The share of the public expressing concern about the epidemic has significantly declined over time,"" Kates told us. ""This may be a function of three decades of HIV, of having successful treatments, of not seeing death as a constant, etc., but given that HIV is still a major global health challenge in low and middle income countries -- particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa -- and significantly impacts some groups in the U.S., this can also be seen as a potential disconnect and cause for concern."" Work done by the Pew Research Center generally shows the same pattern. Pew put a broader question to Americans, as well as people in scores of other countries, about five dangers facing the world -- the spread of nuclear weapons, ethnic violence, AIDS and other infectious diseases, pollution, and the gap between rich and poor -- and had  people pick the greatest one. In 2014, AIDS ranked at the bottom with just 7 percent. On the other hand, in the years that Pew has asked this question, AIDS had never placed high. In 2002, 11 percent of Americans said it was the greatest threat, slightly above pollution. As with all polling, everything depends on the question you ask. In 2014, when Kaiser asked people how important it was for the United States to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS in developing nations, 39 percent said it was a top priority and 47 percent said it was important, but not the most important. Compared with other health issues, HIV/AIDS ranked a few points behind improving children’s health, providing clean water and reducing hunger. To sum it up, Americans see HIV/AIDS as less of a threat than they once did, but they still recognize it as a global health challenge. Internationally, European countries such as Germany, France and Italy generally echo trends in America. They see other threats as more pressing, but HIV/AIDS has never ranked high compared to ethnic violence or the gap between the rich and the poor. Kates at the Kaiser Family Foundation noted that the media runs fewer stories about HIV/AIDS today. She said that likely drives down the sense that the virus is a threat. Our ruling Bono said that the ""public thinks AIDS is done -- it’s not done.""  There's an obvious bit of rhetorical flourish in Bono's comments, but independent polling does show that the public sees AIDS as less of a threat both at home and overseas than it once did. However, people still rank it rather high on the global health agenda and believe America should continue to help developing nations deal with it. Bono’s broader point is well founded, but his specific claim slightly overstates the situation. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True.","[('Irish Times, Bono: ‘People think Aids is done – it’s not done’, Jan.24,2016', 'https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/bono-people-think-aids-is-done-it-s-not-done-1.2508528'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation,2012 Survey of Americans on HIV/AIDS,July 2012', 'No link'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, Health tracking poll, Dec. 2014', 'https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8334-f.pdf'), ('Polish Aid, Public Opinion Poll 2015, 2015', 'No link'), ('Pew Research Center, Global Indicators Database', 'http://kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kaiser-health-policy-tracking-poll-december-2014/'), (""National Institutes of Health, The Nation's Top HIV/AIDS Researcher Discusses This Continuing Health Threat, Summer 2009"", 'No link'), ('Interview, Kathy McKiernan, spokesperson, One, Jan. 26, 2016', 'https://www.polskapomoc.gov.pl/Public,Opinion,Poll,2015,-,Summary,2434.html'), ('Email interview, Jennifer Kates, director Global Health and HIV Policy, Kaiser Family Foundation, Jan. 26, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Kathleen Weldon, director of communications, Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, Jan. 25, 2016', 'http://www.pewglobal.org/database/')]",/factchecks/2016/feb/09/bono/bono-hivaids-and-public-opinion-correcting-record/

Challenger Chris Larson says Chris Abele tried to end county funding for homeless shelters
","As the first bitter cold snap of the winter struck Milwaukee, state Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) used the weather as a backdrop for a jab at Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele. Larson, who is among three challengers facing Abele in the Feb. 16, 2016 primary election, has made care for the homeless a cornerstone of his campaign. Milwaukee County government and Abele, he says, have not done enough. Larson has criticized Abele over how the county handled funding for programs for the homeless, especially after the loss of a federal grant that helped pay some of the costs for such programs. At one point, he held a news conference in the bitter cold out in front of Abele’s downtown luxury condo to drive home his point, arguing Abele ignored the less fortunate. In a Jan. 7, 2016 Facebook post, Larson claimed: ""Abele once proposed a plan to end county funding to homeless shelters."" Is Larson right? Did Abele propose a plan to end all county funding for the homeless? While we waited for Larson’s campaign to provide backup for the claim, we noticed the Facebook posting had been removed. That’s never a good sign. Larson campaign manager Josh Kilroy then emailed several times about the scrubbed statement. ""Like many social media posts, it was written in haste (by me, I might add) and not as nuanced as it should have been,"" Kilroy wrote. ""The post should have noted that Abele has been trying to end supplemental funding that has been used in recent years to replace money that used to come from the federal government."" That elaborated on what the post said, but didn’t explain the statement. We asked again. Kilroy said the Facebook post simply was missing a word -- supplemental. The post, he said, ""not only inaccurately described Abele's policy, it inaccurately states Larson's own position, which has always been to criticize Abele's repeated attempts to remove the additional $300,000 from the budget. He added: ""As the author of the Facebook post you inquired about, I apologize for any misrepresentation of Abele’s record."" Well OK, then. Before we go any further, let’s look at Abele’s record on funding for the homeless. It’s been the subject of budget disputes between the county executive and the board for several years. In 2012, the first budget under Abele, and for 2013, the county included $718,000 in such funding. Of that, $300,000 came from federal money. However, that federal funding ended for the 2014 budget year. And in that year and in the two subsequent budgets, Abele’s budget included the $418,000 the county had been paying for the homeless programs. The County Board then added $300,000 in county funding to replace the federal money. For the 2014 budget, Abele did not veto the amendment providing the additional funding, but said he viewed it as a one-time allocation. The homeless shelters, he said, should seek new sources of revenue. The following year, Abele did not add the money in his budget, but the board did. He vetoed it, but that veto was overridden. In the fall of 2015 for the 2016 budget, the board added the funds, but this time around Abele did not veto the amendment. One thing is clear from this back-and-forth: at no point did Abele ever proposed ending all county funding to homeless shelters. Rather, the debate has been over whether or not the county should pick up the costs that were previously covered by the feds. So for the five years Abele has been county executive, he’s included at least $418,000 for homeless shelters. Abele’s administration argues that funding for county programs to help the homeless has increased under his leadership. Housing administrator James Mathy said those increases included $750,000 in the 2016 budget for  case management, staffing and other services to end chronic homelessness; $1.37 million to develop ""new supportive housing units for the homeless used to cover case management services and rental subsidies"" from 2013 to 2015 and $500,000 for development of an apartment project to support the chronically homeless who have severe alcohol additions. In a statement issued at a news conference outside Abele’s condo, Larson was quoted as saying: ""Homelessness remains a problem for many Milwaukee families, and Abele's recurring pattern of ignoring the needs of Milwaukee's homeless citizens is inexcusable."" The news release added: ""As County Executive, Larson will maintain the increased funding for emergency shelters."" Our rating Larson said on Facebook that Abele ""once proposed a plan to end county funding to homeless shelters."" After we asked about the claim, the post disappeared, Larson’s campaign manager said it was wrong and apologized. We rate Larson’s claim False.","[('Sen.

No evidence Pelosi planned to tear Trump’s State of the Union speech at start
","One of the most viral moments of President Donald Trump’s 2020 State of the Union address was when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., publicly tore up a copy of his speech. Republicans called her actions after the speech disrespectful, Democrats celebrated her ripping Trump on national TV. Others engaged in a playground-like ""he started it!"" pointing out Trump did not shake her hand at the outset of the speech. Now a conservative journalist says her tear was premeditated before Trump started his address. ""Here's Pelosi testing to see if she could rip the speech before the speech even started,"" tweeted Brandon Morse, a senior editor at RedState, on Feb. 5. ""She was planning to do it from the start."" (He credited a Reddit user for the video.) Two hours later, Morse tweeted a follow-up:  ""I need to make a correction. Pelosi actually divided the papers into piles and tested them before ripping them. This exact moment caught here occurred not before Trump's speech began, but 50 minutes into it."" (His article about the video got a correction, too.) Morse’s initial tweet drew about 40,000 likes or retweets while his ""correction"" tweet drew less than 2,000 likes or retweets by noon the next day. So we wanted to set the record straight about his initial message. We attempted to reach Morse but did not hear back. RELATED: Charlie Kirk wrongly suggests Pelosi broke law by ripping Trump State of the Union speech RELATED: Fact-checking Donald Trump's 2020 State of the Union address The video clip that Morse tweeted shows Pelosi turning over the pages of Trump’s speech, but part of her actions are underneath a table and not fully in view. Based on the video alone, we can’t say what she was doing.  Pelosi has indicated her decision came later on in the address. ""He didn’t want to shake hands, That meant nothing to me, that had nothing to do with my tearing up —  that came much later,"" she said at the weekly press conference Feb. 6. Pelosi said she started reading ahead. ""I just went right through that thing so I knew what was coming. When I saw the compilation of falsehoods, when I heard the first quarter or third then I started to think there has to be something that clearly indicates to the American people that this is not the truth and he has shredded the truth in his speech, he is shredding the Constitution in his conduct, I shredded his ‘state of his mind’ address."" That’s consistent with what was reported as telling Democrats in a closed-door meeting the day after the State of the Union. Those news reports are based on anonymous Democratic aides or people who attended the meeting. The Hill quoted Pelosi as calling herself a ""speed reader"" who could not let what she saw as a ""pack of lies"" stand. ""So, somewhere along the way, realizing what was coming, I started to stack my papers in a way that were tear-able,"" the Hill quoted her as saying. ABC News and Reuters had similar accounts, and Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill  said the quotes are accurate.  Morse’s article mentions The Hill report and then argues that ""she clearly planned to rip the speech before she even knew what was in it."" The New York Post showed photos that appeared to show tiny tears on the edges of Pelosi’s paper copy. The Post showed an 18-second clip of Pelosi and said she ""pre-ripped."" But this moment was about 46 minutes into his speech when Trump was talking about Rush Limbaugh, not at the start.  Here’s our take after watching Trump’s speech on C-SPAN: The camera was focused on Trump and sometimes the audience, so it doesn’t show Pelosi during every second of his roughly 80-minute speech. Pelosi was seated and her hands aren’t always fully visible. Pelosi sometimes flipped through the papers, appearing to read parts of it. Based on the video of Pelosi, we can't say when she had a thought to rip up his speech. Morse says a video proves Pelosi ""was planning"" to rip up President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address ""from the start."" Morse tweeted a video showing Pelosi flipping through a paper copy of Trump’s speech while he spoke. The video clip does not prove Pelosi planned to rip up Trump’s speech.  A couple hours later, Morse tweeted that the video clip was actually 50 minutes into the speech. But his initial tweet drew far more reactions.

Are wages rising? Elizabeth Warren says no. Data say yes (slowly)
","Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is concerned about the state of worker pay in the United States. ""Instead of building a new factory, or instead of training new workers, or starting a new product line,"" Warren said, many companies use their influence in Washington to rewrite laws in ways that benefit their profit line. ""The next thing you know, we have an America where the (gross domestic product) keeps going up, where corporate profits keep going up, where the stock market keeps going up, and where hard-working families have flat wages and rising expenses for health care, for housing, for child care, for trying to send a kid off to school,"" she said during a CNN town hall in New Hampshire. The part that caught our ear was what Warren said about ""flat wages."" Over the past six years, that’s not correct. Wages have been rising, with a few minor and subsequently reversed dips, since the second quarter of 2014. During that period, which included about three years each under Democratic President Barack Obama and Republican President Donald Trump, wages rose by 9.7% above the rate of inflation. Warren’s campaign told PolitiFact that over the longer term, wages have been growing rather slowly, especially for those in the bottom half of the income spectrum. On that claim, the campaign has a point. For Americans in the lower part of the spectrum, income has generally outpaced inflation by only a slight margin since 1974, according to data collected by the left-of-center Economic Policy Institute shows inflation-adjusted data for wages going back to 1973. However, it’s worth noting that wage statistics do not include other types of income, including payments from programs like Social Security, food stamps, or refunds from the earned-income tax credit. So working Americans’ actual income flows may be higher than is indicated by their wages alone. ""What Sen. Warren says with respect to real wages is frequently said by political leaders, but it is incorrect,"" said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist. ""Real median earnings have been rising for more than a half decade, even if it may not feel that way to some wage earners whose wages have flatlined or even trended down over that period."" Warren said that ""we have an America where … hard-working families have flat wages."" People can disagree about whether a 9.7% increase over six years is fast enough, but is not flat.

Trump’s State of the Union claim about welfare, food stamp declines is off
","In his third State of the Union address, President Trump claimed that since he took office: ""7 million Americans have come off of food stamps and 10 million have been lifted off of welfare."" There is some data to back him up when it comes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, but our analysis found that the data is flawed. In addition, we could not substantiate his claim that 10 million people have been lifted from welfare. There are around 7 million fewer Americans participating in SNAP, sometimes called food stamps, than when Trump entered the White House, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture. The program provides ""nutritional assistance"" to people with low incomes or disabilities. That’s what the data shows, but there are some issues. The real number is likely a bit lower due to two things: A data reporting problem in North Carolina and a reporting discrepancy from the 2018-19 government shutdown. SNAP participation numbers by state show there are no North Carolina recipients being accounted for from October 2017 through all of 2019, dragging down the national average of recipients. (In 2018, the News and Observer reported that North Carolina's food stamp numbers were too good to be true.)  During the winter 2019 government shutdown, the federal government asked states to issue double the amount of SNAP benefits in January so enrollees would not miss their  February benefits if the shutdown continued. (It lasted from Dec. 22, 2018, to Jan. 25, 2019.) Because of this, numbers for January 2019 are consistent with the number of people receiving food stamps in prior months. But February 2019’s numbers show a huge drop, which also drags down the average. With all this being accounted for, the number of reductions may be closer to 6 million. Also, SNAP participation was falling since before Trump took office, a trend that experts say is likely due to a growing economy. Participation in the program usually follows along with the official poverty rate, which has been falling since 2010. Meanwhile, the administration finalized a rule in late 2019 that tightens guidelines on who can receive benefits and for how long. The changes are expected to move more ""able-bodied"" adults into the workforce, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a news release. The rule was projected to end benefits for about 700,000 people.  RELATED: Fact-checking Donald Trump's 2020 State of the Union address Trump’s claim that 10 million people were lifted ""off of welfare"" doesn’t add up. We didn’t hear back from the White House when we asked about this claim. One key problem is that ""welfare"" is an imprecise term. Besides SNAP, we reviewed the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and its Separate State Maintenance of Effort. Under TANF, the federal government provides a block grant to states, which use the funds to operate their own assistance programs. When Trump took office in January 2017, there were about 3.68 million recipients of these programs combined. In June 2019, that number dropped by about 825,000 to 2.85 million.  The Center for Law and Social Policy, an advocacy organization for low-income people, told us it’s hard to determine how Trump arrived at the 10 million number.  Elizabeth Lower-Basch, director of the organization’s income and work supports team, said it couldn’t be the TANF caseloads, as those numbers are much too low.  ""It’s possible the administration could get to 10 million by combining reductions in TANF with reductions in the use of Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or food stamps), but we haven’t seen any published data that show this figure,"" Lower-Basch wrote in an email. Most people think of ""welfare"" as a program for people who are not working, Lower-Basch said. In that respect, Medicaid, CHIP and SNAP don’t necessarily fit into that category as the vast majority of people who are getting these types of benefits are children, seniors, or working adults. Trump said, ""Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off of food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare."" Trump’s claim that 7 million Americans have come off food stamps since he took office isn’t too far off, although some discrepancies in reporting show slightly skewed data. The decline is also likely due to both the growing economy and the administration’s policy changes that have affected eligibility for some groups.  But his broad welfare claim overshoots actual caseloads and appears to include programs that provide benefits to children and seniors as well as working adults.  We rate this Half True. ","[('PolitiFact, President Trump correct about food stamp low, July 16, 2019', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/jul/16/donald-trump/president-trump-correct-about-food-stamp-low/'), ('USDA, SNAP table, Dec. 6, 2019', 'No link'), ('USDA, SNAP states table, Jan. 3, 2020', 'https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/resource-files/34SNAPmonthly-12.19.pdf'), ('USDA, USDA Restores Original Intent of SNAP: A Second Chance, Not A Way of Life, Dec. 4, 2019', 'No link'), ('Reuters, Trump administration moves to remove 700,000 people from food stamps, Dec. 4, 2019', 'https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/resource-files/29SNAPcurrPP-1.pdf'), ('News and Observer, North Carolina food stamp numbers are too good to be true, Jan. 31, 2018\xa0', 'No link'), (""NPR, With The Shutdown Over — For Now — The Country's Neediest Are Still Scrambling, Feb. 8, 2019"", 'https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2019/12/04/usda-restores-original-intent-snap-second-chance-not-way-life'), ('US Department of Health and Human Services, TANF Caseload Data, Aug. 5, 2019', 'No link'), ('Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Policy Basics: An Introduction to TANF, Aug. 15, 2018', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-foodstamps/trump-administration-moves-to-remove-700000-people-from-food-stamps-idUSKBN1Y82C9'), ('Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Factors Affecting SNAP Caseloads Aug. 8, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Elizabeth Lower-Basch income and work supports team director at the Center for Law and Social Policy, Feb. 5, 2020', 'https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article197554959.html'), ('Email interview, Elizabeth Lee spokesperson at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Feb. 5, 2020\xa0', 'No link'), ('Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Taking Medicaid Coverage Away From People Not Meeting Work Requirements Will Reduce Low-Income Families’ Access to Care and Worsen Health Outcomes, Aug. 13, 2018', 'https://www.npr.org/2019/02/08/692514152/with-the-shutdown-over-for-now-the-countrys-neediest-are-still-scrambling'), ('Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Most Working-Age SNAP Participants Work, But Often in Unstable Jobs, March 15, 2018', 'No link'), (""Healthcare.gov, The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Accessed Feb. 6, 2020"", 'https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/resource/tanf-caseload-data-2019')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/06/donald-trump/trumps-state-union-claim-welfare-food-stamp-declin/

Trump says the USMCA is the biggest trade deal ever – but there’s been bigger
","President Donald Trump touted the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, as the ""biggest trade deal ever made"" shortly after signing it into law. BIGGEST TRADE DEAL EVER MADE, the USMCA, was signed yesterday and the Fake News Media barely mentioned it. They never thought it could be done. They have zero credibility! His tweet built on past claims that the USMCA is the ""largest,"" ""most significant,"" ""modern"" and ""balanced"" trade agreement. The revised agreement mostly updates NAFTA, which has been in place since 1994 and was previously the largest U.S. trade deal ever signed. The USMCA adds significant changes for the auto industry and implements new policies on intellectual property protection, the Canadian dairy market, and labor and environmental standards. Trump overreaches by calling it the ""biggest trade deal ever made."" For one, it’s not a trade agreement from scratch; it’s building off of NAFTA. And two, this neglects larger trade pacts across the world.  In 2018, the European Union signed a trade agreement with Japan, covering a quarter of the global economy and 600 million people. Although the Trans-Pacific Partnership never came into force, it included the same three USMCA partners –– the United States, Canada and Mexico –– as well as nine other Pacific Rim countries and would have represented nations with 40% of global gross domestic product. Trump withdrew the United States from the pact his first week in office. Then there is the mammoth 1994 Uruguay Round trade talks, which included the United States and 122 other countries, kicking off the World Trade Organization. The initial membership of the WTO ""accounted for more than 90% of international trade in goods and services,"" found the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The WTO now has more than 160 members, including China. Trump’s campaign pointed us to evidence that shows how substantial the USMCA is for the United States alone. The latest International Trade Administration data shows that total U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico (under NAFTA) is the largest of any U.S. free trade partners. As a percentage of total trade, Canada and Mexico account for about 30% of U.S. goods exports and imports, according to a 2019 Census Bureau report on top trading partners. Trump tweeted that the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, is the ""biggest trade deal ever made."" The deal is more incremental than Trump describes. It updates NAFTA and introduces changes for the auto industry and the United States’ access to Canada’s dairy market. It also implements new policies on intellectual property protection, labor and environmental standards and digital trade. In terms of U.S. trade deals, the USMCA replaces NAFTA as the biggest American deal. Overall, multiple other trade deals around the world eclipse the USMCA in terms of the number of countries involved and economic output.  We rate this False.","[('Twitter, Donald Trump tweet, Jan. 30, 2020\xa0', 'https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1222982067799121926'), ('PolitiFact, Is the new NAFTA the biggest trade deal ever, as Donald Trump said?, Dec. 1, 2018', 'No link'), ('Office of the US Trade Representative, UNITED STATES–MEXICO–CANADA TRADE FACT SHEET Modernizing NAFTA into a 21st Century Trade Agreement, Accessed Jan. 31, 2020', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/dec/01/new-nafta-biggest-trade-deal-ever-donald-trump-g20/'), ('World Trade Organization, The Uruguay Round, Accessed Jan. 31, 2020', 'No link'), ('New York Times, Trump Falsely Calls China Trade Agreement ‘Biggest Deal There Is’, Jan. 15, 2020', 'https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets/modernizing'), ('New York Times, Trump Signs Trade Deal With Canada and Mexico, Jan. 29, 2020', 'No link'), ('Vox, USMCA, Trump’s new NAFTA deal, explained in 600 words, Jan. 29, 2020', 'https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact5_e.htm'), ('CBS, Fact check: Is Trump right that the new trade deal is ""biggest"" ever?, Oct. 2, 2018', 'No link'), ('Associated Press, AP FACT CHECK: Is Trump’s new trade deal really a landmark?, Nov. 30, 2018', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/us/politics/trump-china-trade-deal-fact-check.html'), ('Email interview, Zach Parkinson Donald Trump campaign spokesperson, Feb. 4, 2020', 'No link'), ('International Trade Administration, FTA partners - total goods, November 2019', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/business/economy/usmca-trump.html'), ('Census.gov, Top Trading Partners - November 2019, Accessed Feb. 4, 2020', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/06/donald-trump/trump-says-usmca-biggest-trade-deal-ever-theres-be/

Conservative activists promote misleading, ‘undercover’ video about voter fraud
","With Democratic primary elections starting, a secretly recorded video is spreading misinformation about voter fraud. The video, uploaded to YouTube on Jan. 22, is titled ""LEAKED: DNC Group teaches ILLEGAL VOTING in Arizona."" It shows two men pretending to be undocumented immigrants as they approach a Democratic activist at a Women’s March rally in Phoenix, Ariz., on Jan. 19. The video caption reads: ""After asking the organization's co-founder, Richard Gooding, about how to vote as non-citizens, asking if they ‘support illegals,’ the staffer told our undercover journalists how they could sneak around voter laws and vote as non-citizens in federal elections!""  The video was flagged by VineSight, a company that uses artificial intelligence to flag misinformation on social media. We also found the video on Twitter and Facebook. The ""undercover journalists"" in the video, Joe Basrawi and Josh Aminov, are college students and conservative activists for Turning Point USA, a group that supports limited government and free markets. The YouTube video is similar to clips from Project Veritas, an investigative outlet run by conservative activist James O’Keefe. Project Veritas has a history of using undercover reporting, hidden cameras and selectively edited videos. With that in mind, we wanted to take a closer look at what was said during the video. We found that Gooding’s comments were misconstrued to play into a common conspiracy theory about voter fraud. The shaky video lasts nearly four minutes. It shows a booth at an outdoor event. No one’s face is visible. Over the course of the recording, Basrawi and Aminov repeatedly question Gooding about how they can vote illegally. At four points, Gooding tells them that they must be citizens to vote. Here’s everything that Gooding, co-founder of the liberal grassroots organization AZ Blue 2020, said in response: Aminov: ""I like Democrat but I come here illegally. Can I register?"" Gooding: ""No, you can’t."" …  Gooding: (to Basrawi) ""Are you registered to vote?"" Basrawi: ""No."" Gooding: ""How old are you?"" Basrawi: ""21."" Gooding: ""Are you a U.S. citizen?"" Basrawi: ""Not yet."" Gooding: ""OK. Are you going to get your naturalization?"" Basrawi: ""Maybe. I don’t know."" Gooding: ""Well, when you do, if you do that, they actually have people there that will register you to vote, but you have to be a U.S. citizen and over 18."" Basrawi: ""Oh.""  …  Basrawi: ""I’m from the Middle East. I came here to study.""  Gooding: ""Where at? Where are you at school?"" Basrawi: ""Over at ASU. I want to vote to get Trump out of office.""  Gooding: ""You have to get your citizenship to vote."" Basrawi: ""I have to get my citizenship. There’s no way for me to vote?"" Then the camera shuts off and is replaced by some distorted audio that claims to be the same interaction. In it, Gooding tells Basrawi and Aminov that, for them to vote, they’d have to ""tell me you’re a citizen when you’re not."" Gooding: ""You can go to the Secretary of State’s office, and ask them for a federal form because they don’t verify your citizenship."" Basrawi: ""And I can register to vote?"" Gooding: ""Yes, but you’re going to have to check the box that says you’re a citizen. I mean you would, and it’s illegal, but …""  When Basrawi and Aminov press him on the comment, asking if it’s a ""big deal"" or if they would get deported, Gooding says: ""I have no idea."" Aminov: ""I want to support party."" Gooding: ""Yeah, I know. Really the best thing to do is to become a citizen.""  When the two men continue to press Gooding on the voter registration form, he clarifies. Aminov: ""Tuesday we can come, we register to vote and we don’t need citizen."" Gooding: ""Well, there’s a federal form, and they don’t check your citizenship. So you illegally registered to vote."" Then the video shuts off again. The video is misleading on several fronts. First, AZ Blue 2020, the group that Gooding belongs to, is not part of the Democratic National Committee. A public Facebook group for AZ Blue 2020 describes itself as ""an independent organization of energized volunteers who want to make a difference. Our goal is to elect Democrats at every level to create a Democratic governance in Arizona by 2020."" RELATED FACT-CHECK: Did 3 million undocumented immigrants vote in the 2016 election? The organization’s mission is to ""empower and prepare the grassroots members of the Democratic Party, the Precinct committeepersons.""  Gooding told PolitiFact that AZ Blue 2020 does not have a connection to the DNC, which oversees the national efforts of the Democratic Party. ""We are a AZ State PAC and an Indivisible group,"" he said, referring to a progressive movement that launched after Trump’s election. In a phone call, Basrawi conceded that AZ Blue 2020 is not a DNC group but stood by the video’s assertion that Gooding was teaching ""illegal voting."" During the YouTube video, Gooding repeatedly told Aminov and Basrawi that, if they want to vote in the federal election, they should become citizens. He said it’s illegal to register as a citizen if you’re not. What Gooding was describing in the video about a federal form is an Arizona quirk: the state accepts voter registration forms from people who don’t provide proof of citizenship, such as a valid driver’s license, birth certificate, passport or naturalization documents. But they can only vote in federal elections, they have to attest to their citizenship when they register, and they must bring a valid photo ID to their polling place. ""A person is not required to submit proof of citizenship with the voter registration form, but failure to do so means the person will only be eligible to vote in federal elections (known as being a ‘federal only’ voter),"" the Arizona secretary of state’s website reads. ""A ‘federal only’ voter will become eligible to vote a ‘full ballot’ in all federal, state, county and local elections if he or she later provides valid proof of citizenship to the appropriate County Recorder’s office."" If federal-only voters lie about their citizenship on Arizona’s voter registration form, they are subject to prosecution, said C. Murphy Hebert, director of communications for the Arizona secretary of state. The federal voter registration form also asks about applicants’ citizenship status. Respondents must check either yes or no, under penalty of perjury. RELATED: Report about potential Iowa voter fraud is false ""We never use the federal form and have never registered a voter using the federal voter registration form, because we could be registering non-citizens,"" Gooding told PolitiFact in an email. ""My error was sharing that information with those with an ulterior motive."" Undocumented immigrants sometimes end up registered to vote after getting a driver’s license or state ID card. The Arizona Republic has reported on efforts by state elections departments to verify voters’ citizenship.  Officials in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, told the newspaper that ""instances of non-citizens or undocumented immigrants attempting to register, let alone casting ballots, are extremely rare."" According to a database maintained by the conservative Heritage Foundation, there have been 20 confirmed instances of voter fraud in Arizona dating back to 2009.  A YouTube video claims to show a ""DNC group"" teaching ""ILLEGAL VOTING in Arizona."" The group that the video purports to show is a grassroots local political organization in Arizona, and is not affiliated with the DNC. The activist in the video said multiple times that it’s illegal to register as a U.S. citizen if you’re not. He told the two men in the video that there is a loophole in Arizona and federal law by which prospective voters can register to vote without showing proof of citizenship. He did not encourage undocumented immigrants to try to illegally vote. The YouTube video is inaccurate. We rate it False.","[('The Arizona Republic, ""Are undocumented immigrants voting in Ariz.?""

No evidence Patrick Mahomes said he thinks George Zimmerman is innocent
","Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes led his team on Feb. 2 to its first Super Bowl victory in 50 years. But before the big game, Twitter users called out the NFL star for an old tweet about George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who was acquitted of criminal charges on July 13, 2013, in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.   The Miami Herald reported that Mahomes was 17 when he responded to a high school classmate’s tweet that day about Zimmerman’s trial.  The classmate’s tweet said: ""This case was an absolutely horrible tragedy, however there was no criminal activity that occurred."" Mahomes replied: ""No one knows what actually happens which is why he is not guilty but a crime could have occurred."" Twitter users shared that tweet and another screenshot of a tweet from 2011, in which Mahomes responded to another account and said: ""stop resisting or assaulting a cop #realcops."" As the Herald documents, Twitter users started using the tweets, which have since been deleted, as evidence that Mahomes supports Zimmerman.  But a Jan. 14 blog post on MTONews.com goes further with this headline: ""NFL Star Patrick Mahomes: ‘I believe George Zimmerman is INNOCENT’!!""  It goes on to say that Mahomes believes Zimmerman is not guilty and that he supports the trial’s verdict.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Other tweets from Mahomes’ exchange with his high school classmate show him saying ""there was no reason for Zimmerman to follow him and Trayvon just defended himself and Zimmerman had a (gun) so he shot him"" and ""I still don’t understand what the point of him following him with a (gun) was.""  Another tweet he published that day suggests he was disappointed by the verdict and critical of Zimmerman.  ""Knew this was going to happen,"" he tweeted, ""at least you know Zimmerman will never be able to go in public again.""  We rate this headline False.","[('MTONews.com, NFL Star Patrick Mahomes: ‘I believe George Zimmerman is INNOCENT’!!, Jan. 14, 2020', 'https://mtonews.com/nfl-star-patrick-mahomes-i-believe-george-zimmerman-is-innocent?fbclid=IwAR3X8PYvb7XruEm3kiXCAnigPs2nrYpp2kI5Qdb6jC9y3Y6Szp3OFJy67rc'), ('The New York Times, Zimmerman is acquitted in Trayvon Martin killing, July 13, 2013', 'No link'), ('Miami Herald, Patrick Mahomes’ old tweets surfaced.

No, the economy didn't suddenly get strong under Donald Trump
","One of the biggest themes of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address — and one of the biggest themes of his reelection campaign — is that he inherited a weak economy from President Barack Obama and turned it into a strong economy by implementing his own policies.  ""The years of economic decay are over,"" he told the joint session of Congress on Feb. 4, 2020. ""The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. Gone, too, are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power and prestige."" Trump added, ""If we hadn’t reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success."" When we reached out to the Trump campaign, they offered several statistics showing Trump has notched greater gains than Obama did, such as manufacturing job creation, the unemployment rate, and economic growth. We found those statistics, and other specific facts Trump cited during the State of the Union, were accurate, or largely so. However, unlike Obama, who inherited the Great Recession, Trump inherited an economy that was already getting back on its feet. Overall, we found a continuation of the favorable trend lines Trump inherited from Obama. We looked at 15 common economic statistics, from unemployment rates to growth in gross domestic product to poverty, foreclosures, and bank failures. They cover the period of the Great Recession until today. Where possible, we’ve highlighted periods under a Republican president in red and periods under a Democratic president in blue. The bottom line: For virtually each of these measurements, we found that the trend lines continued almost seamlessly from the second half of Obama’s presidency into the first three years of Trump’s tenure. Trump’s claim that he turned around a failing economy is wrong.  ""I do not think economic gains have been any faster or better under Trump than gains we would have forecast based on the steady improvements we saw in the economy and job market in President Obama’s second term,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.  Also, no president has total control over the factors affecting the economy. Broader trends beyond their powers — from international economic conditions to technological changes — shape the course of the economy as well. ""All our decisions together produce the economy,"" said Aaron Sojourner, a University of Minnesota economist. ""It doesn't change when the resident of the White House does."" For unemployment rates and for median weeks of unemployment, the declines under Obama were at least as fast — if not faster — than they have been under Trump. That holds for several of the racial and ethnic groups Trump often cites in speeches, as well as for women.   Meanwhile, since the recovery gained speed, the pattern of monthly job gains has been quite similar under both Obama and Trump. That’s also broadly true for manufacturing job gains, a metric that Trump has been especially focused on.   The percentage of Americans either working or looking for work took longer to recover than other statistics, and it still hasn’t returned to pre-recession levels. This statistic did fall for most of Obama’s tenure, but it started to rise in his final year and has continued to rise under Trump.  Inflation-adjusted wages fell for much of Obama’s first term, but they began rising again during his second term. Their path under Trump has been along much the same trajectory.   As a candidate, Trump promised 4% economic growth. But he’s never hit that mark in any quarter (Obama did so in four quarters) and he has hit 3% in four quarters, the same number that Obama did during an equivalent period, his final three years in office. The poverty rate and food stamp use has declined under Trump. Those declines began during Obama’s final years in office.   The big declines in foreclosures, bankruptcies and bank failures occurred under Obama, with marginal advances under Trump.    Trump often touts how the stock market has risen on his watch, and it has, to record levels. But a look at the Standard & Poor’s 500, a broad measure of stock market value, shows that the markets have risen at roughly the same rate under both presidents.  Trump may have his strongest argument on the most intangible of these statistics: consumer confidence.  Regular measurements by Gallup and the University of Michigan show a ""breakpoint right after the election"" in Trump’s favor, said Jed Kolko, the chief economist for Indeed.com. In Gallup’s measure, for instance, the statistic broke into positive territory with Trump’s election and has stayed there, after being in negative territory for virtually all of Obama’s tenure. ""Multiple economic confidence measures took an immediate and sustained jump after the election, even though it's hard to find similar shifts among the key measures of actual economic performance,"" Kolko said. But another widely tracked statistic, the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index, shows a continuing rise during Obama’s full tenure that presaged the later heights Trump reached. Trump said that ""years of economic decay are over"" because he ""reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration.""

Polling high before the nomination season doesn’t mean a clear path to the White House
","A few days before Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., announced the end of his White House bid, he encouraged Iowans with whom he was campaigning to disregard polling numbers when choosing a candidate in their state’s first-in-the-nation presidential nominating precinct caucuses. Booker urged his Iowa audiences to caucus Feb. 3 for candidates who inspire them.  ""Do not make this decision based on what the polls say,"" Booker said at a Jan. 9 event in North Liberty, Iowa. ""They've never predicted who will be president from our party. Carter was in the single digits a few months before caucuses. Bill Clinton was. Obama — 20 points behind in the national polls roughly. And they all went on to be our president."" We found Booker’s statement to be true, because, from 1972 to 2016, fewer than half of  nonincumbent candidates who won the Democratic presidential nomination led national polls taken between November and January leading up to Iowa’s caucuses. Moreover, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama lagged behind in national polls in the months leading up to Iowa’s caucuses. We reached out to the Booker campaign for comment on Booker’s statement and where he got his information from but received no response. Booker suspended his campaign on Jan. 13.  To research the numbers, we started with 1972 because that year marked the beginning of the  Democratic Party’s modern nominating process. Democratic Party members are surveyed locally and nationally to take stock of the amount of support for a presidential candidate at a snapshot of time. Polling data are a determining factor in who gets to grace the party’s debate stage, which gives presidential hopefuls a platform to pitch their ideas in front of a national audience and garner support from potential campaign donors and likely voters. ‘They’ve never predicted who will be president from our party’  FiveThirtyEight compiled polling data from competitive primary elections starting in 1972, comparing the eventual nominee’s performance in the polls in the first and last halves of the calendar year to other Democratic contenders. From 1972 to 2016, it showed, only three out of 10 non-incumbent Democratic nominees were ahead in national polls up to three months before Iowa’s caucuses.  In the last half of 1983, former Vice President Walter Mondale polled nationally at an average of 40.1 percent, leading throughout a six-month period. An early top-polling Democratic nominee didn’t show up again until 2000, when Al Gore became the Democratic nominee after polling at an average 54.8 percent. Hillary Clinton had the highest pre-caucus polling numbers leading up to the 2016 caucuses, an average of 60.7 percent in the second half of 2015. But while each won the party’s nomination none won the presidency. University of Iowa political-science Professor Fred Boehmke wrote in an email to The Daily Iowan that too many unknowns exist to use polling numbers as a reliable predictor of nominees. ""So the short answer is that there is a lot of truth in what Booker says — polls won’t tell us with great confidence who the nominee will be at convention time,"" Boehmke said, referring to the national nominating convention. ""It’s not even that the polls might be wrong or poorly done. It’s that lots of people haven’t made up their minds, we don’t know who will turn out for the upcoming caucuses and primaries, we don’t know who will drop out and when and where their supporters will go, and we don’t know the major campaign-relevant political events that will shape the primary."" David Redlawsk, a political science professor at the University of Delaware who has researched and written about Iowa’s caucuses, said current national polls are about the nomination, not the presidency.  ""I know he's talked about people (who) became president, but you've got to get the nomination first,"" Redlawsk said. ""This isn't about, you know, head to head for November. It's the nomination. Because I think that's what that focus has to be."" In early January 1976, a national Gallup poll put Carter at 4 percent, with Hubert Humphrey in the lead at 29 percent. Gallup put Bill Clinton at 17 percent, 4 percentage points behind then-California Governor Jerry Brown, in early January 1992. According to December 2007 national polling data from Gallup, Obama’s poll numbers were much lower than Hillary Clinton’s before the Iowa caucuses. The polls put Obama at 27 percent, with Hillary Clinton in the lead with 45 percent.  Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama trailed in national polls before becoming the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee and later became president. Only Walter Mondale, Al Gore and Hillary Clinton led early Democratic Party national polls before the Iowa caucuses since 1972 and none went on to become president. Booker was correct about this. We have ruled Booker’s statement as True.","[('North Liberty campaign event, Iowa, Jan. 9, 2020', 'https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-more-than-40-years-of-early-primary-polls-tell-us-about-2020-part-1/'), ('Email interview with University of Iowa political-science Professor Fred Boehmke', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with UI visiting Professor David Redlawsk', 'https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-more-than-40-years-of-early-primary-polls-tell-us-about-2020-part-2/'), ('FiveThirtyEight, What More than 40 Years of Early Primary Polls Tell Us About 2020: Part 1, April 1, 2019', 'No link'), ('FiveThirtyEight, How Early Primary Polls Foreshadowed Surprises like Obama’s Rise and Trump’s Win, April 9, 2019', 'https://news.gallup.com/poll/10120/history-shows-january-frontrunner-often-does-win-democratic-nomination.aspx'), ('Gallup, History Shows January Front-runner Often Does Not Win Democratic Election, Jan. 6, 2004', 'No link'), ('Gallup, Clinton Maintains Large Lead Over Obama Nationally, Dec. 18, 2007', 'https://news.gallup.com/poll/103351/clinton-maintains-large-lead-over-obama-nationally.aspx')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/06/cory-booker/polling-high-nomination-season-doesnt-mean-clear-p/

No, Casten did not call for Trump’s impeachment before Mueller report release
","President Donald Trump’s legal team and his supporters argue Democrats in Congress fueled by partisan politics began making a case for impeaching Trump the day he took office. Illinois Republican congressional candidate Jeanne Ives last week took a similar jab at Democratic U.S. Rep. Sean Casten of Downers Grove, who holds the 6th District west suburban seat she wants. A press release from her campaign states Casten ""demanded the impeachment of the Republican President before the Mueller report was even released."" That’s a reference to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s account of his investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, including possible ties between Trump’s campaign and Russian officials. A redacted version of Mueller’s report released on April 18 affirmed the Trump campaign thought it would benefit from Russia’s election interference. But the report did not establish coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. It also detailed the president’s efforts to curtail the nearly two-year probe. Casten was critical of Trump during this time but the freshman congressman did not announce his support for launching an impeachment inquiry until two months after Mueller’s report was made public. And, even then, he did not say he would vote yes on articles of impeachment drawn up by the House until December. ""I didn’t run for Congress to impeach the President,"" Casten said in a June 20 press release that noted he had read the report and was alarmed by its findings. ""But I also ran for office because I felt the people of my District deserved transparency from their elected representative. That’s why, after much thought and careful deliberation, I support opening an impeachment inquiry into the President of the United States."" So we contacted Ives’ campaign to find out what she was referencing. Instead of providing evidence showing Casten had gone public with his support for impeachment prior to the release of Mueller’s report, spokeswoman Kathleen Murphy highlighted a different point on the timeline. ""He didn't wait for Mueller's congressional testimony,"" Murphy wrote in an email. ""Casten was only interested in getting whatever thinly veiled contrivance he could get to support a position he’s had from the day Trump was elected: removing Trump from office. As soon as the Mueller report was released, he ran screaming into the public square to declare it what he wished upon a star it would be rather than what it actually was."" Murphy also claimed Casten voiced support for impeachment before he was even elected, pointing to a 2018 Sun-Times candidate questionnaire in which he stated that ""strong and plentiful evidence"" of Russian election interference could not be ignored. ""It is imperative that the Mueller investigation into this matter be allowed to continue to its conclusion without obstruction from the White House or interference by Congress,"" Casten continued, a passage Murphy highlighted. However, Casten made no call for impeachment in his Sun-Times response. And at several points during his 2018 campaign when he was asked where he came down on the issue, he stopped short of advocating for the House to take that course. Casten later called for an inquiry when such a move was beginning to gain traction among House Democrats. As a freshman Democrat who flipped a district held by Republicans for nearly five decades, he was one of the first vulnerable members of his party to take that stance. The House introduced two articles of impeachment against Trump on Dec. 10, 2019. Those articles say Trump wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and a debunked conspiracy related to the 2016 election. They also say Trump withheld security aid and a White House meeting to pressure Zelensky, then obstructed Congress to cover it up. On Dec. 12, Casten announced in a tweet he would vote in favor of impeachment. Ives said Casten ""demanded the impeachment of the Republican President before the Mueller report was even released."" Mueller’s report was released on April 18, 2019. Casten called for an impeachment inquiry on June 20, 2019, and announced publicly he would vote in favor of impeachment on Dec. 12, 2019.

Charlie Kirk wrongly suggests Pelosi broke law by ripping Trump State of the Union speech
","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., drew the ire of Republicans when she tore up a copy of President Donald Trump’s 2020 State of the Union address. One conservative pundit said she deserved more than just the ridicule of her GOP colleagues. ""Nancy Pelosi may have just committed a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2071, Section 2071 (a) when she ripped up President Trump’s State of the Union address,"" Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk wrote in a Feb. 4 tweet. ""This violation is punishable by up to three years in prison.""  US Code prohibits the destruction of government recordsNancy Pelosi may have just committed a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2071, Section 2071 (a) when she ripped up President Trump’s State of the Union addressThis violation is punishable by up to three years in prison🤔 Kirk’s claim made the rounds on Twitter, with former congressional candidate Carl Higbie, North Carolina Rep. Dan Bishop and Donald Trump Jr. all repeating or retweeting versions of it. But when we asked a number of legal experts about what Kirk said, we found that their answer was unanimous: Kirk’s claim is wrong. ""I take it that this is a printout of the Trump speech, in which case it is absurd to suggest that Pelosi can be prosecuted for doing with it whatever she pleases,"" said Heidi Kitrosser, a law professor at the University of Minnesota.  In a statement to PolitiFact, a spokesperson for Kirk cited the federal law Kirk mentioned and a Justice Department webpage summarizing it. ""Anything that comes out of the office of the president is a government document under the Presidential Records Act of 1978,"" the statement said. The statute in question deals with the ""concealment, removal, or mutilation generally"" of records and reports. It sets a penalty for anyone who ""conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys"" any government record ""filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States.""  The statute also says that any person with ""custody"" of a government record cannot ""willfully and unlawfully"" conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, falsify or destroy it. ""The point of the statute is to prevent people from destroying records in official repositories like the National Archives or in courts,"" said Georgetown Law professor Victoria Nourse. Pelosi is in the clear, experts said, because her copy of Trump’s speech wasn’t a government record.  The State of the Union text was never ""filed or deposited"" with her, nor did she have ""custody"" of it in the legal sense. Video of the event shows that Trump handed her and Vice President Mike Pence copies before he began speaking, and Pelosi can be seen following along throughout.  President Donald Trump hands copies of his State of the Union address to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence before delivering it to Congress on Feb. 4, 2020, in Washington. (AP/Semansky) ""Her copy of the State of the Union address is not a government record or government property at all,"" said Douglas Cox, professor of law at the City University of New York School of Law and an expert in the laws governing the preservation of government records. ""It is personal property.""   Under House rules, members of Congress are encouraged to preserve records or donate them to a research institution for historical study, Cox said. Unlike congressional committees, members are not legally required to hold onto their office’s files. ""They can keep them private, they can destroy them, or they can rip them up,"" he said. This is in contrast to presidential records, which have been considered government property since the Presidential Records Act of 1978 and are supposed to be stored with the National Archives for safekeeping. ""The State of the Union is a presidential record, which must go to the National Archives under the Presidential Records Act,"" Nourse said ""(Pelosi) did not mutilate the record that is filed with the Archives."" The purpose of the records law ""is to prevent someone from depriving the government from the use of its documents,"" so Pelosi’s move ""doesn’t fit within the statute,"" added Kathleen Clark, professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis. There are probably countless copies of Trump’s address, such as the version the White House posted online. Pelosi’s action doesn’t preclude future generations from accessing one. ""If the statute were not read this way, then any copy of the State of the Union held by anyone could never be destroyed,"" Nourse said. For what it’s worth, Trump has a habit of ripping up papers when he’s done with them. According to Politico, staff members have had to tape Trump’s shredded files together in order to send them to the Archives and avoid crossing the Presidential Records Act. Kirk said, ""Nancy Pelosi may have just committed a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2071, Section 2071 (a) when she ripped up President Trump’s State of the Union address."" Experts told us that’s a misapplication of a law. The papers Pelosi ripped up did not belong to the government, nor were they the only copy of Trump’s speech in existence.

Did Trump oversee historic funding increase for child care?
","President Donald Trump told Congress during his State of the Union address that under his watch the federal government has achieved record spending on child care. ""I have also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality child care, enabling 17 states to help more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether,"" he said Feb. 4. We asked the White House to provide evidence but did not get a response. Trump was likely referring to the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which he touted in a December 2019 list of his accomplishments. Trump is correct that he oversaw a historic funding increase. But we don't have complete information on how many children have been removed from wait lists. Experts said Congress gets the credit for passing the increase. The block grant program that started in 1990 is the largest source of federal funding for child care. The federal government sends money to states to subsidize child care for low-income families. Parents who generally are working or in school pay a small copay. About 1.3 million children received this subsidy in 2018. Congress included a $2.37 billion increase for the block grants in the fiscal year 2018 omnibus spending bill. It was the largest one-year increase in federal funding for child care in history, according to the Center for Law and Social Policy, an advocacy organization for low-income people.  The low-income day care program has enjoyed bipartisan support, even before the Trump years, said Stephanie Schmit, an analyst at the center.  In his address to Congress, Trump said he had ""overseen"" the historic increase. But his 2018 budget proposal called for a $95 million decrease in the program compared with actual spending in 2017. Ultimately Congress approved an increase anyway. Funding remained relatively flat for fiscal year 2019. But in the 2020 appropriations bill, Congress boosted the program by about $550 million. It’s tricky to determine the precise impact the additional funding had on waiting lists, because the money can be spent over a number of years. But we found two reports that support the idea. A National Women’s Law Center report found that eight states were using or were planning to use the extra money to serve families on the waiting list. (Those eight states were Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas.) A Government Accountability Office analysis on how states used the money after 2018 found that nearly one-third of surveyed states (16) reported plans to use the new funds to pay for spots for children on wait lists.  Child care advocates say the funding increases are good news, though vast needs remain: Of the children eligible in 2015, only 15% received subsidies, according to a 2019 analysis by the federal government. That percentage is unlikely to change substantially even after the funding increases, said Karen Schulman, an expert at the National Women’s Law Center. There are likely more eligible families that need care than actually applied, said W. Steven Barnett, senior co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University.  ‘Waiting lists are the currently eligible people who bothered to sign up to wait, not all of the people eligible and unserved,"" he said. Trump said, ""I have also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality child care, enabling 17 states to help more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether."" Congress passed a historic increase in funding in 2018, and Trump signed it into law. What Trump left out of his remarks is that he proposed a $95 million cut for the grant program that year. (Congress then passed another increase in 2020, which he signed.) Determining the impact of that increase on waiting lists is murkier. The reports we saw indicated that between eight and 16 states planned to use money for children on waitlists. We rate this claim Half True.  ","[('Factbase, President Donald Trump State of the Union, Feb. 4, 2020', 'https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-state-of-the-union-february-4-2020'), ('Government Accountability Office, Child care, April 2019', 'No link'), ('CLASP, Impact of $550 Million CCDBG Funding Increase for States, Jan. 15, 2020', 'https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/698704.pdf'), ('CLASP, Trump Administration Would Cut Child Care and Early Education Investments, May 25, 2017', 'No link'), ('National Women’s Law Center, Fact sheet, July 2017', 'https://www.clasp.org/publications/fact-sheet/impact-550-million-ccdbg-funding-increase-states'), ('National Women’s Law Center, Fact sheet, January 2019', 'No link'), ('Budget of the U.S. Government, 2018', 'https://www.clasp.org/blog/trump-administration-would-cut-child-care-and-early-education-investments'), ('U.S. Office of the Administration for Children and Families, FY 2017 CCDF ALLOCATIONS (Including redistributed Funds)', 'No link'), ('U.S. Office of the Administration for Children and Families, FY 2018 Preliminary Data Table 17 - Average Monthly Mean Family Co-payment as a Percent of Family Income', 'https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Trump-Budget-Would-Reduce-Families-Access-to-Early-Care-and-Education-Final.pdf'), ('White House, President Donald J.

According to the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus  is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The 2019 strain was first reported from Wuhan on Dec. 31.  As of Feb. 4, more than 20,000 cases have been confirmed globally. Deaths total 426, with only one occurring outside of China. Some cleaning product labels mention ""human coronavirus"" because those surface products have been proven effective against past strains of coronavirus. On its website, Lysol has a section dedicated to the coronavirus. It says that specific Lysol products, including its disinfectant spray, ""have demonstrated effectiveness against viruses similar to 2019 Novel coronavirus (2019-n-CoV) on hard, non-porous surfaces."" (Again, this is only when used to clean surfaces; such products should never be ingested!) This Facebook post falsely assumes that because the label for Lysol disinfectant spray includes mention of its effectiveness against ""coronavirus,"" media descriptions of a current outbreak as being caused by a new virus are ""B.S."" But that assumption is wrong. The Lysol spray has demonstrated effectiveness against past strains of coronavirus. The current outbreak spreading from Wuhan, China, is caused by a previously unidentified strain known as the 2019 Novel coronavirus. Cleaning products that list coronavirus on their labels are not referring to this strain. We rate this Facebook post False.","[('Facebook post, Jan. 31, 2020', 'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3046916602006699&set=a.213191238712597&type=3&theater'), ('PolitiFact, Fact-checking hoaxes and conspiracies about the coronavirus, Jan. 24, 2020', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, Clorox bottles don’t prove the coronavirus was ‘developed’ before the outbreak, Jan. 30, 2020', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jan/30/facebook-posts/clorox-bottles-dont-prove-coronavirus-was-develope/'), ('Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Human coronavirus types, Jan. 10, 2020\xa0', 'No link'), ('World Health Organization, Coronavirus, visited Feb. 5, 2020', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jan/30/facebook-posts/clorox-bottles-dont-prove-coronavirus-was-develope/'), ('World Health Organization, Novel coronavirus, visited Feb. 5, 2020', 'No link'), ('World Health Organization, Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation report - 15, Feb. 4, 2020', 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html'), ('Clorox, Clorox disinfecting wipes, visited Feb. 5, 2020', 'No link'), ('Lysol, Understanding the coronavirus, visited Feb. 5, 2020', 'https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus'), ('FactCheck.org, No, Clorox and Lysol didn’t already ‘know’ about new coronavirus, Jan. 31, 2020', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/05/viral-image/no-lysol-label-doesnt-prove-coronavirus-isnt-new/

Fact-checking Trump’s State of the Union claim on sanctuary cities, criminals
","During the 2020 State of the Union address, President Donald Trump slammed ""sanctuary cities"" for their limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ""In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed,"" he said. Trump cited an incident in which an undocumented immigrant released from custody allegedly assaulted and killed a 92-year-old woman in New York City. Trump also spotlighted the brother of a man killed in a crime spree by an undocumented immigrant released in California. ""The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens,"" he said, calling on Congress to pass a bill to let victims sue sanctuary cities. There’s no federal definition for a sanctuary city, and the details vary from place to place. But broadly speaking, the term refers to any jurisdiction that refuses to continue holding people in local jails beyond their jail or prison sentence solely because ICE has asked the jurisdiction to do so. (ICE’s request is formally known as a detainer.) The individual cases Trump addressed were documented in media reports, and the White House has published a list of other criminal noncitizens shielded from ICE officials.  But Trump’s claim that local officials ""order police to release dangerous criminal aliens"" makes setting criminals free sounds like standard operating procedure. As we detailed while fact-checking a similar claim in 2018, that’s not the case. Even sanctuary cities typically turn over to ICE many of the felons Trump warns about. The White House and Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. ICE news releases report numerous instances of ignored detainer requests that result in undocumented immigrants being set free and later arrested by ICE.  According to ICE’s report for the 2019 fiscal year, 86% of the roughly 143,000 noncitizens arrested by ICE had criminal convictions or pending charges. It’s unclear how many were arrested after being released in sanctuary cities. The report says ICE issued 165,487 detainers to law enforcement officials, and that ""a number of aliens who have been released under these circumstances have gone on to commit additional crimes."" Some insight came during an October Senate hearing, when ICE official Timothy Robbins said the agency brought roughly 1,300 noncitizens into custody over the span of a ""few weeks,"" including ""large numbers"" of people who had been released in sanctuary cities.   Robbins said three of those 1,300 people had prior convictions for manslaughter or murder, 100 had convictions for sexual assault or related crimes, 70 had convictions for drug-related crimes, and 320 had convictions for driving under the influence. ""Almost 200 of the aliens arrested during the most recent operation could have been taken into custody at local jails if the detainer had been honored,"" Robbins said. Robbins did not say whether any of the 200 people ICE targeted with detainers went on to commit further crimes or, in Trump’s words, ""prey"" on Americans.  Sanctuary policies across the country treat dangerous criminals differently, but experts told us many have specific ways of dealing with them. ""A number of the sanctuary policies have carve-outs for individuals with certain types of felony offenses, and some non-felony offenses,"" Annie Lai, clinical professor of law at the University of California Irvine, told us. ""You want to see if the policy allows for detention for ICE, notification to ICE, transfer to ICE or transfer only with a warrant. Each of these mean different things."" California’s sanctuary law, for example, gives law enforcement officials leeway to hold someone for ICE if they’ve committed one of a number of crimes.  The list includes gang-related offenses, assault, battery, sexual abuse and exploitation, rape, crimes endangering children, burglary, robbery, theft, fraud, forgery, any crime resulting in death, some domestic violence offenses, and drug and weapon-related offenses. In New York City, people convicted of one or more of 177 types of felonies within the last five years can be handed over to ICE authorities, but only if those authorities secure a warrant first. Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at the Migration Policy Institute, told us she’s ""unaware of a jurisdiction that releases ‘dangerous criminal aliens’ as a matter of policy."" ""Where jurisdictions have set limits on their cooperation with ICE typically revolve around the issue of whether the agency is seeking transfer of a noncitizen who has been booked or charged versus an offender who is completing a criminal sentence, as well as whether ICE needs to seek a court order for the request to detain a noncitizen,"" she added. Mittelstadt explained that when noncitizens are released in sanctuary cities, ""the criminal justice process has taken place or is taking place as it would in the case of anyone else."" ""When state and local prisons release noncitizens without transfer to ICE, the person has completed their criminal sentence, has been released without charge, or has been charged and released on bond pending further action in the criminal justice system,"" she said. The New York City murder suspect Trump mentioned had originally been arrested for attacking his father with a broken coffee cup and arraigned on charges of assault and criminal possession of a weapon before he was released pending trial, according to reports.  He had not yet been convicted on those charges by the time of the alleged murder. Meanwhile, the California man who went on a crime spree in 2018 had previously been convicted of armed robbery. But the charge was 15 years old, meaning local police couldn’t use it to justify holding him for ICE, according to the Washington Post.  He had been deported twice before, in 2004 and 2014, and was arrested in 2018 after a caller reported erratic behavior. He tested positive for use of a controlled substance, but because that offense only carried a misdemeanor charge, he was released after 10 hours in custody.  Mike Boudreaux, the county sheriff on the case, blamed California’s sanctuary law for keeping his officers from coordinating with ICE authorities. ""That tool has been removed from our hands,"" he said, according to the Washington Post. ""And because of that, our county was shot up by a violent criminal."" Trump said, ""In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed."" Sanctuary policies don’t mean that undocumented criminals get to walk free of charges, or that local officials order police to release them as standard operating procedure.  Noncitizens facing arrest still go through the criminal justice system; sanctuary policies mean that they aren’t turned over to ICE authorities after they’ve done so. Still, many sanctuary policies include specific provisions allowing law enforcement to comply with ICE’s requests when it comes to noncitizens who have been convicted of felonies. That’s the case in both California and New York City — the two places Trump called out by name.  Media reports and ICE press releases have documented some cases in which noncitizens with serious criminal records were released by police in spite of detainer requests. But these individuals had already gone through the criminal justice system in one way or another.

Are there more guns than citizens in the U.S.? Depends on the study
","Culpeper Sheriff Scott Jenkins recently told state senators that reinstating Virginia’s one-handgun-a-month purchase limit would not reduce crime. He was speaking before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 13, a few minutes before the panel approved the limit. Slightly different versions of the legislation have since passed the Senate and the House, largely on party-line votes with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, backs the measure. Jenkins spoke against the bill and made an interesting statistical claim. ""Simply put, there are more guns in this country than there are citizens,"" he said. ""All you’re going to do is continue to drive up the cost for the criminal to purchase the illegal guns. Evil will still be committed."" Are there more guns than people in the United States? The estimates Hard figures on the number of guns in the U.S. are elusive. In the past few years, headlines in the Washington Post and on Vox have declared there are more guns than people in the country. Both noted a surge of gun sales following the 2008 election of President Barack Obama.   But the headlines suggest the figures are certain when they’re not, given that there is no record keeping that would produce an actual count of guns in the United States. As the Pew Research Center has observed, ""Gun ownership is one of the hardest things for researchers to pin down."" At the same time, there have been studies to produce estimates on the number of civilian guns in the nation. Both the Post and Vox noted an estimate on the high end - 310 million guns - that was cited in a 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The study said the estimate was based on U.S. Department of Justice data and was the ""total number of firearms available to civilians"" as of 2009. That 310 million count is higher than the U.S. population in 2009 of about 307 million and the citizenship estimate of 285 million, estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau. But one gun-statistics expert, Philip Cook at Duke University, told the Post that the actual figure then was probably closer to 245 million guns, not 310 million, to take into account circumstances such as guns that break down or are lost or destroyed. Cook and two other experts -- Tom Smith at the University of Chicago and Daniel Webster at the Johns Hopkins at the Center for Gun Policy and Research -- have told PolitiFact the best, most recent estimate is in a study published in October 2017 by researchers from the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. A total of 3,949 adults, representative of the U.S. population, were surveyed online. The lead author of the study, Deborah Azrael, says respondents were asked if they owned guns and how many, and told not to count BB guns, replicas or other firearms that were not functioning.  The estimate: 265 million civilian guns in the United States, as of when the survey was taken, in January 2015. The number of U.S. citizens at that time, according to the Census Bureau, was about 299 million. Other highlights of the Harvard study: Of the estimated 265 million total civilian guns, 113 million were handguns. The typical gun owner (the median, in the survey) owned two guns. 39% of the estimated 265 million guns were owned by 8% of the gun owners -- that 8% of all owners owned 10 or more guns. Prior fact checks PolitiFact has previously rated two claims that there are more guns than people in the U.S. That’s similar - but not identical - to Jenkins’ claim that there are more guns than citizens.  One of the claims was made in 2013 by Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton, the non-voting delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives representing the District of Columbia; the other in 2018 by Kevin Nicholson, an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congress in Wisconsin. PolitiFact National, noting the lack of firm gun numbers, rated each statement Half True. Our ruling Jenkins says, ""There are more guns in this country than there are citizens."" There is no actual count of the number of firearms in the United States. A 2009 study by the Congressional Research Service suggests Jenkins is right. A well-regarded 2015 study at Harvard suggests he’s wrong. So we rate Jenkins’ statement Half True.  ","[('Culpeper Sheriff Scott Jenkins, Comments to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Jan. 13, 2020 (28:42 mark).', 'http://virginia-senate.granicus.com/ViewPublisher.php?view_id=3'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, Nativity Status and Citizenship in the United States, 2009.', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact Wisconsin, ""Which is higher: The number of people or the number of guns in America?""

"['Environment', 'Climate Change', 'Federal Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Tammy Baldwin']","
Wisconsin Sen. Baldwin makes point with claim on costs of climate change damage in U.S.
","When it comes to weather and climate change, there has been lots of talk about causes and consequences. In some areas of Wisconsin this winter, rapidly melting snow has overtaken roads and caused sewage to overflow, while flooding and its effects continue to be a concern. The National Weather Service in Green Bay indicated most rivers in northeastern Wisconsin have more than a 50% chance of flooding to some extent. Whether it be the toll on infrastructure or disrupting business operations, weather and climate change carries a monetary cost. On Dec. 10, 2019, the U.S. Senate Democrats’ Climate Committee sent out a tweet arguing Wisconsin roads and bridges are at risk of collapse from severe storms and flooding. That same day, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., tweeted this about the national cost: ""Over the past two years, climate and weather disaster damage has cost the U.S. over $400 billion and our economy will lose over $500 billion annually from lost labor, crop failure and damages related to extreme weather if we don’t #ActOnClimate now."" Is Baldwin right about $400 billion-plus in damages? The source When asked for backup for the claim, Baldwin’s staff pointed to The Fourth National Climate Assessment, a 1,526-page document that examines the effects, risks and course of climate change in the United States.  The Fourth National Climate Assessment is a cooperative effort between experts from academia and government agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Department of the Interior.  On page 66, the report indicates NOAA estimates the United States incurred $400 billion in damages from weather and climate disasters from 2015 through April 6, 2018.  But that figure is for different years and a longer time period (three-plus years) than Baldwin claimed. NOAA climatologist Adam Smith from the Center for Weather and Climate at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, N.C., noted the numbers in the report are also a bit dated. He pointed us to newer figures. Baldwin’s reference was to the ""past two years."" She made the statement in December 2019, so examining the two-year span immediately before that, her numbers are dramatically off. NOAA estimates the U.S. experienced $137.8 billion of economic damage from 2018 and 2019 when adjusted for the consumer price index, and $135.6 billion unadjusted.  However, looking at the two most recent full years before Baldwin’s claim — 2017 and 2018 — Baldwin’s figures line up. NOAA estimates the inflation-adjusted damage in those calendar years was $411.7 billion. The NOAA calculation includes damage to buildings and public infrastructure, among other costs. The agency tracks damage from drought, flooding, freeze, severe storms, tropical cyclones, wildfires and winter storms. Smith said in an email NOAA uses data from agencies such as the National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Interagency Fire Center. There are some types of data they do not include due to inconsistencies. ""For example, our disaster cost estimates are actually somewhat conservative, as we don’t account for losses/damages to natural capital assets, mental and physical healthcare-related costs post-disaster, or incorporate all downstream economic impacts,"" Smith wrote. We checked with several experts from academia who agreed that the NOAA numbers are probably the best available for the United States. The agency’s data shows that the number of disasters that topped $1 billion in damages has increased each decade since the 1980s.  There were 119 weather and climate disasters that topped that threshold during the 2010s, up from 59 in the 2000s, even after adjusting for inflation. Over the past three years (2017 through 2019), there was an average of nearly 15 disasters that topped $1 billion in damages.  Our ruling Baldwin said ""Over the past two years, climate and weather disaster damage has cost the U.S. over $400 billion."" Her claim is on target for 2017 and 2018 -- though if  the two years were measured from the date of her claim, essentially covering 2018 and 2019, there was a much-lesser amount in damages. Our definition of Mostly True is ""The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""  That fits here.","[('Email interview with Adam Smith, NOAA through NOAA’s Office of Communications for Satellites, Jan. 14, 2020', 'https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/summary-stats'), ('Email interview with Dr. Frances Moore, assistant professor at UC Davis, Jan. 15, 2020', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Dr. James Rising, research fellow at the London School of Economics, Jan. 21, 2020', 'https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/time-series'), ('National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ""Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Summary Stats,"" 2020.', 'No link'), ('National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ""Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Time Series,"" 2020.', 'https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2010-2019-landmark-decade-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate'), ('Adam Smith (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), ""2010-2019: A landmark decade of U.S. billion-dollar weather and climate disasters,"" Jan. 8, 2020.', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/05/tammy-baldwin/wisconsin-sen-baldwin-makes-cents-costs-climate-ch/
