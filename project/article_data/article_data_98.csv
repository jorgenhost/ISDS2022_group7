Will a countywide vote on urban renewal cost taxpayers “a fortune” and an alternative backed by Clackamas County commissioners cost less?
","
Voters love to save money. They also probably don’t want to spend ""a fortune"" on unnecessary elections. These are precisely the points being made by supporters of a Clackamas County board-backed measure on the Nov. 8 ballot.

A campaign mailer in favor of Measure 3-388 urges voters to say no to county Measure 3-386, a competing proposal that would require a county-wide vote on future urban renewal project areas.

""There are two measures on the ballot having to do with Urban Renewal. In one way they are the same: both require a vote of the people before any Urban Renewal Area can be established in unincorporated Clackamas County. But there are two very important differences:""

The mailer says that 3-386 ""Costs MORE money. An Urban Renewal Area affecting only a few hundred people would trigger a county-wide election covering over 200,000 voters, costing taxpayers a fortune.""

The mailer also urges a yes vote on Measure 3-388, which would require approval from a smaller number of voters who live in a proposed urban renewal district. This is the proposal backed by the Clackamas County Board of County Commissioners. The mailer says this measure ""Costs LESS money. Smaller election = less cost."" 

You guessed our burning question: Does the county-wide measure cost ""a fortune"" while smaller elections cost less? (A similar mailer went out just this week.)

Measure 3-386 was put on the ballot by citizen petitioners who don’t like the county board approving new urban renewal areas without a county vote. If this measure passes, any new plan or substantial change to an existing plan would need to be approved by a majority of county voters in a primary or general election. In other words, commissioners would have two opportunities every two years.

The competing measure put forth by the county board, Measure 3-388, would send the issue only to voters who live in a proposed or existing district. So there would be fewer voters voting, but this election could happen during one of four authorized elections a year. That’s eight opportunities every two years.

At first blush, it sounds as if a countywide election would be just as cost effective. After all, how much could it cost to add a question to a general or primary election ballot that needs to go out anyway so people can vote on federal and state offices?

County elections manager Steve Kindred says that an urban renewal question on a general election ballot wouldn’t cost more if it goes to more voters. The ballots would be the same size whether the question goes to 200,000 voters or 1,000 voters. The Voters’ Pamphlet is not zoned. Turnout would be high anyway in a general election so the issue probably wouldn’t boost processing costs.

On the other hand, an off-year election strictly for an urban renewal question, no matter how small the voting pool, could cost an extra $10,000.

We contacted Ann Lininger, a Clackamas County commissioner serving as one of the point people on the more limited proposal. She said the county-wide measure would cost more because it would require more notice and explanation to more voters who live in disparate parts of the county.

There is a requirement in the county-wide measure that the county send notice to voters before an election. The notice must explain that there is an urban renewal measure on the ballot; that it would take away from other public services for x number of years; that the maximum amount of indebtedness would be x dollars; and that the maximum amount of interest would be x amount.

The measure allows the county to include that information in the 500-word explanatory statement required by state law. But Lininger said that option is not feasible, given the complexity of a development plan and the need to make sure voters understand the issue. So the county would have to spend at least $45,000 on mailers, she said, and more on staff time for public meetings.

""You would want to have the opportunity to make a case in the explanatory statement,"" she said. 
But Beaverton officials had no problem including that same information in their Voters’ Pamphlet statement for Measure  34-192, which proposes a new urban renewal area. Eric Winters, the attorney who drafted the citizen-approved measure in Clackamas County, said the Beaverton explanatory statement pretty much meets his test. And there was room to explain the plan.

Measure 3-386 may very well cost more than 3-388 in the end, if you factor in all the time and resources commissioners and staff would need to promote an urban renewal measure or make a significant change to one. But that’s campaigning, not just providing basic information or holding an election.

The statement in the mailer zeroes in on election costs. We find that the proponents of the smaller election option have not proved their case that their version would cost less or that a countywide election would cost a fortune. In fact, special elections could cost more.

The statement is not accurate. We rate it False.

Tim Ryan says the poverty rate for women is highest in two decades
","
Conservatives frequently take shots at Planned Parenthood because it provides abortions, even though the controversial procedure is but a small part of what the health care organization provides.

Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee, led by Florida Rep. Cliff Stearns,  launched an investigation in September 2011 into Planned Parenthood by demanding that it provide years of information about its federal funding and its compliance with abortion restrictions.

This didn’t sit well with Rep. Tim Ryan, a Ohio Democrat from Niles, who called the investigation a baseless, ideological attack on Planned Parenthood, which he described as a trusted provider of health care to millions of people, ""many of whom would otherwise not receive vital services like pre-natal care, well woman exams and cancer screenings.""

Among those Planned Parenthood treats are the poor, according to Ryan. In a news release Sept. 28, he detailed just how those numbers are increasing in the United States:

""These attacks come at a time when the poverty rate among women is the highest in nearly two decades and 1 in 5 women under 65 don’t have access to health care.""

We will leave the debate over abortion rights which is at the center of this flap to Ryan, Stearns and others. But PolitiFact Ohio took a look at Ryan’s claims about impoverished women without health care.

The stats back up the first part of the claim -- that the poverty rate among women is the highest in nearly two decades.  

Ryan based his information on an analysis by the National Women’s Law Center of U.S. Census Bureau data. It shows that the poverty rate for women ages 18 to 64 rose to 14.5 percent in 2010, the highest rate in 17 years.

Furthermore, the number of women it classifies as living in extreme poverty (with incomes less than half of the federal poverty level) checked in at 6.3 percent, the highest rate over the 22 years the measurement has been taken.

What about the second part of Ryan’s claim; that 1 in 5 women (or 20 percent) under 65 don’t have access to health care.

Ryan again relied on the National Women’s Law Center analysis, only what the organization more precisely stated is that the number of uninsured women between the ages of 18 and 64 rose to 19.7 percent in 2010. That figure counts only women who had no coverage of any kind, private or public, for the entire year.

Ryan’s statement equates not having insurance to not having access to health care. While a woman, or any person for that matter, without health insurance finds it much more difficult or expensive to get medical treatment, there are places they can go, at least in an emergency.

Many physicians will see an uninsured patient if they are dogged enough and the ailment severe enough, said Henry Aaron, senior fellow with the Brookings Institution in Washington, but that’s asking an awful lot of the patient.

And non-profit hospitals are obligated to stabilize patients with serious conditions, he said, but perhaps not to provide follow-up treatment.

""The whole thing is your treatment is delayed,"" he said.

Those without insurance also find it more difficult to get simple check-ups and then to find a doctor who will write a prescription, Aaron said. They are often embarrassed to ask for charity or to run the risk of being refused.

""(Being uninsured) just leaves barriers, psychological and financial, to acquiring health care,"" he said.

Ryan reinforced that point when we contacted his office.

""This economic barrier to health insurance obstructs many women from obtaining the most basic health care,"" he said. ""While these women are legally guaranteed treatment to stabilize emergency conditions at some hospitals, this promise falls far short of the access to medical care most of us depend upon to stay healthy and safe. It's shameful that in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, we have allowed women to reach such a high level of poverty.""

Planned Parenthood is part of the safety net of health care providers for the indigent, said Tara Broderick, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio.

Less than 30 percent of its clients have health insurance. Those who don’t have insurance are billed on a sliding scale, she said.

As for abortion services, nationally, only about 10 percent of Planned Parenthood’s clients receive an abortion or an abortion pill, Broderick said, and the percentage locally is even smaller.

The 50,000 people (primarily women) who visited one of Planned Parenthood’s 13 offices in Northeast Ohio last year were more likely to receive non-abortive birth control assistance or medical check-ups such as pap tests, breast and pelvic exams and blood work for checking cholesterol levels or for evidence of diabetes, Broderick said.

So, how do we rate Ryan’s statement?

Before returning to Ryan’s statement, we note one other point Aaron made.There is a wide enough difference in the amount of health care that someone with insurance receives compared to someone without insurance that there is ""something"" about Ryan’s statement that conveys truth, he said.

Politifact Ohio would agree.

On Ryan’s first point about the rate of poverty for women, census data backs his assertion.

On the second part he said 1 in 5 women age 18 to 65 don’t have access to health care. That differs from the census database, which said 1 in five do not have health insurance.

That’s a point that needs clarification. And that also consistent with  Ryan’s underlying point, that the number of women in poverty is at a high point, and that getting access to health care would be difficult for many women without services of agencies like Planned Parenthood.

On the Truth-O-Meter we rate Ryan’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/nov/02/tim-ryan/tim-ryan-says-poverty-rate-women-highest-two-decad/
"['Rhode Island', 'Pensions', 'Public Service', 'Retirement', 'Workers', 'Lincoln Chafee']","
Gov. Lincoln Chafee says Rhode Island would be first state in U.S. to adopt hybrid retirement plan for public employees
","
If state lawmakers approve the Chafee administration’s plan to overhaul Rhode Island’s ailing public pension system, most state workers, teachers and many municipal employees will be enrolled in a so-called hybrid retirement plan.

The hybrid plan that Governor Lincoln Chafee and General Treasurer Gina Raimondo have been touting would combine a smaller guaranteed monthly payout from a traditional pension with a variable payout based on the investment earnings of a 401(k)-style plan.

While pitching their pension overhaul legislation to a joint meeting of the Senate and House  Finance Committees Oct. 24, Chafee, an Independent, spoke at length about how the plan would address the state’s $9.4-billion pension shortfall.

""And also,’’ the governor said, ""somebody told me recently that if Rhode Island does a hybrid plan we’ll be the first state in the nation to do this.’’

The first in the nation?

Chafee continued: ""And I think that’s in all of our interest to show the rest of the country that we can take on this challenge and share the ups and downs of the market with the employer and the employee. Right now, we the state, the employer, takes all the hit when the market goes down. And so I think the country will be looking at us . . . ""

Rhode Island, of course, isn’t the only state to wrestle with pension problems. So we wondered: Would Rhode Island be the first in the nation to adopt a hybrid retirement plan?

The facts

A quick search of the Wall Street Journal’s archives turned up a story from July 10, 2010, entitled ""States Shift to Hybrid Pensions.’’  The article begins: ""State governments, one of the last bastions of guaranteed pensions, are increasingly taking a page from 401(k) plans that dominate the private sector.’’  Utah, Michigan, Oregon and Washington, the article states, all have some form of hybrid plan.

Next, we called The National Association of State Retirement Administrators, a nonprofit membership organization whose members are directors of the nation’s public retirement systems. Keith Brainard, the association’s research director, provided us with a table that shows that seven states have some form of hybrid plan for public employees. They are: Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, Washington and Utah. (Michigan offers the hybrid plan only to school employees.)

Their plans, like the one the Chafee administration has proposed for Rhode Island, share two features: a traditional pension with a guaranteed benefit, coupled with a 401(k)-style component that offers a payout tied to investment earnings.

We called the governor’s office, and his spokeswoman, Christine Hunsinger, quickly responded that the governor had ""made a mistake.""  Rhode Island, she conceded, would not be the first state to adopt a hybrid plan.

OK, so the governor was wrong. Rhode Island didn’t come up with the idea first. But we still wondered what was happening elsewhere in the country.

We contacted retirement administrators in other states to find out.

At least two states -- Washington and Indiana -- have had hybrid retirement plans since the 1990s.

During the 1990s stock-market boom, a legislative pension committee in Washington saw an opportunity to ""self-fund"" a portion of its retirement plan, said Dave Nelsen, legal and legislative services manager for the Washington State Department of Retirement Systems.

The teachers union was the first to endorse the idea, he recalled, and in 1995, a bill ""sailed through the legislature"" to allow teachers to supplement their traditional pensions with something similar to a 401(k) plan.

In 2002, the State of Washington passed its own bill to create a hybrid option for all new public employees.

Indiana enacted legislation in 1998 to allow public employees to invest some of their retirement money in selected bonds and money market funds.

(The hybrid plan proposed by the Chafee administration is similar to Indiana’s, said Brainard, of the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.)

Ohio offered a hybrid plan to new state employees and those with less than five years of service in 2003.

Oregon followed in 2004; Georgia in 2009; and Michigan (for school employees only) in 2010.

Utah last year replaced its traditional defined benefit pensions with 401(k)-style plans for new state and municipal workers.

The Chafee administration’s proposal could, however, set Rhode Island apart from other states in one respect, Brainard said: it would require not just new hires but also most existing employees (except judges, state police, correctional officers and municipal police and firefighters) to participate in the hybrid plan.

In fact, Hunsinger told PolitiFact that was actually what the governor had been told would make Rhode Island ""the first in the nation.""

But we’d caution the governor on that statement, too. We found that at least one other state -- Kansas -- has proposed doing the same.

The ruling

Governor Chafee was clearly wrong when he told state lawmakers that if they approve his administration’s pension reforms, Rhode Island would ""be the first state in the nation’’ to adopt a hybrid plan.

These types of plans have been widely publicized in the national media and on the National Association of State Retirement Administrator’s web site, and our research found at least seven other states offer hybrid pension plans, some dating back to the 1990s.

We rule his statement False.

"['National', 'Housing', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Democratic National Committee']","
An ad claims Mitt Romney's housing policy is to let foreclosures ""hit the bottom.""
","
An ad from the Democratic National Committee recently attacked Mitt Romney for his position on foreclosures. The ad is aimed at voters in Arizona, a state that has high foreclosure rates -- and a state that Democrats hope will be up for grabs in the next presidential election.

The ad singles out Romney even though he hasn’t yet secured the Republican nomination to run against President Obama in 2012.

""Almost half of Arizona homeowners -- underwater. Foreclosures -- everywhere. And what’s Mitt Romney’s plan?"" the ad says.

Then it shows video of Romney saying, ""Don’t try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom.""  

The ad plays the video again, concluding, ""Mitt Romney’s message to Arizona: You’re on your own.""

We’ve seen enough of these types of ads to know that selective editing can give a different impression of a candidate’s actual position. So we decided to check it out.

We soon discovered the video is from an interview Romney gave to the Las Vegas Review-Journal’s editorial board.

The newspaper posted video of his comments online, noting that they were in answer to the question, ""How will you help with the housing and foreclosure problems in the U.S.?""

Here’s a transcript of Romney’s extended answer from the video:

""As to what to do for the housing industry specifically, and are there things you can do to encourage housing? One is, don't try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom. Allow investors to buy homes, put renters in them, fix the homes up, and let it turn around and come back up. The Obama administration has slow walked the foreclosure processes that have long existed, and as a result we still have a foreclosure overhang. Number two, the credit (that) was given to first time homebuyers was insufficient and inadequate to turn around the housing market. I think it was an ineffective idea. It was a little bit like the cash-for-clunkers program, throwing government money at something which was not market oriented, did not staunch the decline in home values anymore than it encouraged the auto industry to take off. I think the idea of helping people refinance homes to stay in them is one that's worth further consideration. But I'm not signing on until I find out who's going to pay and who’s going to get bailed out, and that's not something which we know all the answers to.""

These remarks seem to be Romney’s most detailed statement of policy on foreclosures and housing. We reviewed his economic plan, ""Believe in America: Mitt Romney’s plan for Jobs and Economic Growth,"" but it has only passing mentions of the housing sector. Instead, his economic plan emphasizes low tax rates, reduced regulations for business, initiatives for the energy sector and measures that would reduce the influence of organized labor.

We were interested to note that Romney indicated he was open to the idea of helping homeowners refinance.

What is refinancing? In general, if homeowners are able to refinance, that means they get lower monthly mortgage payments because they get a lower interest rate on the money borrowed to pay for their homes. Right now, some homeowners are underwater, which means they owe more than their homes are worth. In normal times, that means they can’t refinance.

Romney’s comments indicate he might be open to some government action to encourage refinancing.

On this point, it’s worth noting that one of Romney’s advisers is R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School. Hubbard wrote the foreword to Romney’s economic plan and leads his economic policy team. Outside of the campaign, Hubbard has long promoted a plan to encourage streamlined refinancing for underwater homeowners. Romney’s comments indicate he may be open to such a plan.

Meanwhile, President Barack Obama announced new rules to encourage refinancing on Oct. 24, 2011.

It’s worth noting that his administration’s programs for housing help have not fared well in the past; we rated his promise to help homeowners as Promise Broken since the program fell far short of its goals. We’ll be monitoring the new program to see if it improves on that performance.

Our ruling

The DNC’s ad says that Mitt Romney’s housing policy is, ""Don’t try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom.""  That is part of his policy, but they edited out his remarks that say the housing market should then turn around and come back up as investors buy properties and rent them out. Romney also said he was open to ideas for encouraging refinancing. Romney does seem to favor letting foreclosures run their course, but he also suggests that doing so will enable investors to buy low-priced homes and revive the market.

"['National', ""PolitiFact's Top Promises"", 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama says 60 percent of his promises are 'done'
","
During a fundraising event at a home in Los Angeles on Oct. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama took credit for enacting a majority of his agenda during his nearly three years in office.

""We’ve seen change,"" he told donors. ""We know what it looks like. We know what it takes. But we’ve got so much more work to do. And I keep a checklist in my desk, and I kind of see, all right, I made a bunch of these promises during the campaign -- (laughter) -- and let me see, yes, I got that done -- (laughter) -- and that one, yes. No, that one’s not done yet. (Laughter.) So we’ve got about 60 percent done in three years but -- (applause) -- so I’m pretty confident we can get the other 40 percent done in the next five years. (Applause.) But to do that, I’m going to need your help.""

A few readers wondered what we thought about this figure, since we’ve been using our Obameter to check how well Obama has been keeping 500-plus campaign promises since his inauguration. It is the most comprehensive look at what Obama promised during the campaign.

When we asked, the White House confirmed that it has indeed been using our Obameter as its yardstick.

""By PolitiFact’s own independent assessment, the president has achieved or made progress on over 60 percent of his agenda,"" Kate Bedingfield, a White House spokeswoman, told PolitiFact.

However, Bedingfield’s standard -- ""achieved or made progress"" -- is different from what Obama said at the fundraiser, that he’d gotten ""about 60 percent done."" And that becomes a crucial difference as we rate Obama’s original comment.

To explain, let’s first provide some background on our promise meter, the Obameter. The promises we’re tracking were all made during the campaign; they do not include promises made since Obama took office. We rate them as Promise Kept, Compromise, In the Works, Stalled or Promise Broken.

One caveat: we're constantly in the process of updating our list of promises, so the numbers change frequently. Given the sheer number of promises Obama made, we haven’t managed to update some in a year or more. The bottom line is that any estimates from our work as it stands today should be made with a grain of salt.

That said, here’s the current breakdown of promises on the Obameter:

Promise Kept 151, or 30 percent
Compromise 46, or 9 percent
In the Works 189, or 37 percent
Stalled 68, or 13 percent
Promise Broken 52, or 10 percent
Not Yet Rated 2, or 0.3 percent

We think it’s reasonable to give Obama credit for accomplishing the promises rated Promise Kept or Compromise. Together, those account for 39 percent of all promises.

At the same time, we think it’s fair to say the president hasn’t accomplished those rated Stalled or Promise Broken. Together, those account for 23 percent of all promises.

But to reach 60 percent, the White House needs to include a lot of promises rated In the Works in its count of what's been ""done."" And that’s a problem.

We rate promises In the Works if the administration or its allies in Congress have taken steps to implement the promise but haven’t done enough to move it to either Promise Kept or Promise Broken. Generally speaking, we have had a low threshold for moving promises from Not Yet Rated to In the Works. For instance, if a House Member introduced a bill to enact the promise, we might move it to In the Works -- long before the bill was even considered by the House --  much less passed by Congress and signed by the president. Our threshold for moving a promise to Kept, Broken or Compromise is much more stringent.

So Bedingfield is accurate to say that Obama ""has achieved or made progress on over 60 percent"" of his promises, but Obama himself was wrong to say in his original statement that his agenda is ""60 percent done."" In the Works, which in some cases may consist only of tiny steps toward accomplishment, is not ""done.""

It’s still theoretically possible that Obama could get to 60 percent. To do so, he’d have to score 108 Promise Kept or Compromise ratings out of the 189 promises currently rated In the Works. That would be 57 percent, a steep but not impossible figure. That also assumes he keeps all of his current Promise Kept ratings -- something that could be at risk from, say, an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling on his health care law.

Still, getting the required 57 percent is going to be a huge challenge when facing a Congress where Republicans steadfastly opposed to his agenda control the House of Representative and have displayed great unity in blocking the president.

Our ruling

Obama’s statement at the fundraiser was clearly in the past tense -- about having already ""done"" 60 percent of his promises in three years, and a White House spokeswoman made it clear he was relying on numbers from our Obameter. The White House’s subsequent description -- that Obama ""has achieved or made progress on over 60 percent of his agenda"" -- is essentially accurate based on our data, but that’s not what Obama himself said. By our numbers, the best he can claim for now is 39 percent. So we rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2011/nov/01/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-60-percent-his-promises-are-done/
"['Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Florida', 'Allen West']","
Rep. Allen West turns to talking points on 2010 health care law
","Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West pulled out some familiar talking points on the 2010 health care law in a recent Fox News interview.

It was Democrats who cut $500 billion from Medicare, he said. An unelected board will make decisions about health care for seniors and all Americans, he said.

Similar statements by Republican politicians have earned rulings from Half True to False.

But in the world of PolitiFact, specific word choice matters.

How do West's words hold up?

He spoke with Fox News host Neil Cavuto on Oct. 14, 2011. Here's part of their exchange:

CAVUTO: ""There's concern in your state, sir, that going after entitlements and going after the spending in entitlements, that you're going after granny, that you particularly are going after granny. And that's been the one thing the Democrats are trying to stick to you. What do you say?""

WEST: ""Well, they tried that. And, as a matter of fact, they have failed miserably, because, as a matter of fact, in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it was the Democrats who cut $500 billion from Medicare. And they also put in place the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 15 unelected bureaucrats, which will be making decisions about health care for our seniors and for all Americans.""

He then said he supported, instead, the premium support plan that's part of Rep. Paul Ryan's ""Path to Prosperity."" (Some Democrats have claimed the plan, which shifts the burden for rising health costs to seniors over time, eliminates Medicare. We've ruled that claim False.) We'll look at two claims from the interview, one at a time. The first is that, ""In the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it was the Democrats who cut $500 billion from Medicare."" The second is that ""they also put in place the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 15 unelected bureaucrats, which will be making decisions about health care for our seniors and for all Americans.""

Medicare cuts

We've previously weighed statements that the 2010 health care law ""cut Medicare."" We've listed many among our sources for this item, but here are a few: The 60 Plus Association said the law ""will cut $500 billion from Medicare. That will hurt the quality of our care."" (We ruled that Mostly False.) On the campaign trail, Mitt Romney said ""Obamacare takes $500 billion out of Medicare and funds Obamacare."" (Half True) In Florida, Sen. Marco Rubio said, ""The only people in this town that have voted to cut Medicare spending are the people who voted in favor of Obamacare. That’s a fact."" (Mostly False.)

In those fact-checks, we pointed out that the law doesn't take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. It attempts to slow the program's growth, trimming more than $500 billion in projected spending over a decade. Medicare spending will still increase, from $499 billion in 2009 to $929 billion in 2020.

But those items include other context West doesn't include — he isn't talking about quality of care, for example.

West didn't attempt to clarify that Democrats cut future spending, or cut the rate of growth. His spokeswoman, Angela Sachitano, provided evidence from the Congressional Budget Office and news sources that the reduction would result in lower projected Medicare spending over a decade. But West merely said ""cut $500 billion from Medicare,"" a misleading oversimplification. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details.

'Unelected bureaucrats'

West's second claim, that the law ""put in place the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 15 unelected bureaucrats, which will be making decisions about health care for our seniors and for all Americans,"" should also be familiar to loyal PolitiFact readers.

Republican presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann said something similar in an Oct. 11, 2011, debate: ""These 15 political appointees (on the IPAB) will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans."" We rated that False.

Now, West's claim is more restrained. He doesn't say the board will make ""all the major health care decisions,"" merely that it ""will be making decisions about health care.""

So what is the board, and what is it tasked with?

The health care law directs a new national board — with 15 members who are political appointees — to identify $15.5 billion in Medicare savings.

It's forbidden from submitting ""any recommendation to ration health care,"" as Section 3403 of the health care law states. It may not raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The IPAB also cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue.

What it can do is reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of re-admissions or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some may argue that because the IPAB can reduce the money a doctor receives for giving chemotherapy to a Medicare patient, this could lead to an indirect form of rationing.

But the board wouldn't make any health care decisions for individual Americans. And it wouldn't directly make decisions about health care ""for all Americans."" Instead, as PolitiFact Georgia has reported, it would make broad policy decisions that affect Medicare's overall cost. This statement also contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Our ruling

West used two common talking points in his Fox News interview. The first, which we've checked repeatedly, is that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ""cut $500 billion from Medicare."" The statement leaves out important details.

The second, that the health care law ""put in place the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 15 unelected bureaucrats, which will be making decisions about health care for our seniors and for all Americans,"" also ignores facts that would give a different impression.

We recognize it's not always easy to give context in a fast-paced TV interview, but a just few more words (""will cut projected Medicare spending by"" or ""will be making decisions about Medicare spending"") would have dramatically boosted West's truth quotient. Overall we find his claims Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/nov/01/allen-west/rep-allen-west-turns-talking-points-2010-health-ca/

Nina Turner says plummeting home values have hammered Americans' collective wealth
","
Expect to hear more from Nina Turner in the coming months.

The Democratic state senator from Cleveland is considering a primary challenge next year against incumbent U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge of Warrensville Heights.

The potential race already has political watchers buzzing. Turner has been seen as a rising star since her days on the Cleveland City Council and is well known for breaking with Fudge and other black leaders two years ago to back a successful Cuyahoga County government reform measure. She also is known for her oratorical gifts, having appeared several times on cable network MSNBC to discuss Statehouse issues that have gained attention nationwide.

But does her substance match her style? As Turner explores a congressional bid, PolitiFact Ohio decided to explore a guest column she recently authored for the Politic365.com website.

The site focuses on minority issues, and Turner’s piece, titled ""From Frustration to Prosperity,"" tackled themes that echo far beyond Ohio. In 670 words, she referred to the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements, quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt and endorsed the notion that government can ""breathe life into our otherwise dormant recovery.""

The piece also was chock full of economic statistics that tied together Turner’s contentions. One statement in particular caught our eye: ""The collective net worth of Americans has taken a $5.5 trillion hit, according to the Federal Reserve; mainly due to plummeting home values.""

Though Turner cited her source, it is not uncommon for politicians to hear and repeat numbers out of context, so PolitiFact Ohio went searching for the original source material.

We quickly found that the Christian Science Monitor presented the same figure in the same way in a story published Oct. 19, several days before Turner’s column appeared.

""Since 2007, Americans’ collective net worth has fallen about $5.5 trillion, or more than 8.6 percent, according to the Federal Reserve,"" the article stated. ""The bulk of that decline is in real estate, which has lost $4.7 trillion in value, or 22 percent, since 2007.""

Our Internet search showed the story was picked up by other news outlets across the country. Turner, in an interview, acknowledged that the article got the ball rolling for her column.

But once on the Federal Reserve’s website, we didn’t know where in the haystack of data to find the one particular needle of information we needed. And we didn’t receive any help in response to our calls and emails. Luckily, Christian Science Monitor reporter Ron Scherer and Turner’s aide came through -- and both pointed us to the same set of Federal Reserve numbers.

In a Sept. 16 statistical release, the Fed provided 120 pages of economic figures. The relevant data comes on a ""Balance Sheet of Households and Nonprofit Organizations."" The table includes figures between 2005 and the second quarter of 2011. And since 2007, net worth -- assets minus liabilities -- dropped from $64.2 trillion to $58.7 trillion, or about $5.5 trillion.

The table also confirms the significant drop in home values -- as the Christian Science Monitor reported, about $4.7 trillion -- that accounts for the drastic decrease in net worth.

It is important to note that while Turner’s column did not bookend the $5.5 trillion figure with exact dates, it generally addressed the effects of the recent recession -- the same post-2007 period covered by Scherer. So her use of the Fed numbers from 2007 and after made sense.

Lloyd Doggett says Central Texas food bank deliveries up 50 percent from three years ago
","
In a September 2011 floor speech, Democratic U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin spoke of two concerns he said are growing in the Lone Star State: poverty and hunger.

Doggett said that in tough times, more families are turning to food banks, creating ""immense"" demand. Among his examples: The Austin-based Capital Area Food Bank of Texas ""this year is delivering 50 percent more food to poor people than it did three years ago.""

In his speech, Doggett attributed that figure to John Turner, a food bank official. We wondered if the proclaimed increase was correct, and if so, whether that accurately reflected a surge in hunger in our area.

The food bank, founded in 1981, takes in donations of food and money from the government, the food industry and the public, then distributes food to Central Texas residents directly and through more than 350 agencies in its 21-county service area roughly centered on Travis and Williamson counties. (Click to view a map.) The region’s north edge runs from Mills County in the west to Freestone County in the east; its south edge runs from Gillespie and Blanco counties in the west to Fayette County on the east.

Doggett spokeswoman Sarah Dohl told us by email that Doggett drew his 50 percent figure from a Sept. 4, 2011, news story in the Guardian, a British newspaper, which quotes Turner saying the food bank was delivering 50 percent more food to the poor than it had done three years ago.

In an interview, Turner, the food bank’s senior director for marketing and branding, recently told us he’d given the Guardian a conservative estimate: The pounds of food distributed by the bank had actually increased 64 percent, going from 15.4 million pounds in 2007 to 25.3 million pounds in 2010. Turner noted, too, that the 2010 poundage was inflated by one-time federal stimulus aid enabling the bank to buy an additional 2.3 million pounds for the Summer Food Nutrition Program. Subtract that, and the 2010 figure becomes 23 million pounds -- up 49 percent from what the bank gave out in 2007.

So, do the poundage figures mean hunger in the area shot up 49 percent or more over the past few years?

J.C. Dwyer of the Texas Food Bank Network, the state association of food banks, told us pounds of food distributed generally isn't the best measure of need in a food bank's region: ""It’s more of a metric for how we’re dealing with the needs,"" Dwyer said. A better way of gauging needs, he said, is to track the number of residents requesting food assistance.

That is, the amount of food distributed doesn't necessarily reflect ups and downs in need. In the holiday season, donations and distributions surge, for instance, but that doesn’t necessarily mean surges in need.

Dwyer and Turner each suggested we check on changes in food demands through ""Hunger in America,"" a report commissioned every four years by Feeding America, a national charity that acts as a clearinghouse connecting food supplies to 200 food banks, including the one in Austin.

There was no ""Hunger in America"" report for 2007, the first year in Doggett’s statement, but the reports based on surveys in 2005 and 2009 were broken down into smaller reports covering the Austin bank’s 21-county region: In 2005, the Capital Area bank fed an estimated 174,900 people. In 2009, the estimated number of people served was 284,900 for the year, up 63 percent from those who were served in 2005. 
That change outstripped population growth, according to U.S. census estimates. In 2005, the 21 counties had 2,265,981 residents. By 2009, the region’s population was 2,547,559 -- up 12.4 percent. Put another way, the food bank provided sustenance to nearly 8 percent of the region’s residents in 2005 while about 11 percent of a greater total of residents got food in 2009.

Finally, we wondered if Doggett was correct in saying the food aid went to the poor alone.

Turner told us the bank does not question people who come seeking food as to their income -- if you show up, you are fed, he said, though depending on the lines that form, it could take an hour or two. However, the ""Hunger in America"" report using 2009 data states that 73 percent of the Capital Area food bank’s clients had incomes below the federal poverty level.

Census figures for 2010, drawing on 2009 data, show that poverty in the 21-county region matched the percentage for Texas overall: Seventeen percent of residents had income below the federal poverty level. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, Dwyer told us, ""food insecurity"" across Texas -- the percentage of households at risk of missing meals because of financial pressure -- rose from 14.8 percent in the three-year period 2005-07 to 18.8 percent in 2008-10.

Our conclusion: Changes in the amount of food distributed over several years, which Doggett cited, might not be the best way to gauge changes in residents’ needs. That said, the number of Central Texas requestors for food aid over those years outpaced regional population growth. The 63 percent increase in requestors also exceeded the 50-percent increase in food distributed that he stressed, though, contrary to his statement, not all those pounds of food went to ""the poor.""

Does Clackamas County have more urban renewal debt than all the other counties combined?
","
Under the state constitution, cities and counties have the ability to set up urban renewal districts to combat blight. The financing works like this: The city or county authorizes a blighted area and ""freezes"" the amount of property tax going to public services, such as schools,fire, police and other city or county services. The property owner doesn’t pay any less. But as the value of the property goes up, the difference between the ""frozen"" amount and the new value is diverted to pay for future development within the blighted area, for a period of 20 or 25 or 30 years. Think of South Waterfront in Portland or Clackamas Town Center.

In Clackamas County there’s a fierce battle on the Nov. 8 ballot over who gets to designate new urban renewal areas and change the ones that exist. Currently, the five-member county board decides, upsetting critics who like neither the board nor the concept of urban renewal. (They think urban renewal development sucks money from other public services; fans of urban renewal say those services will eventually benefit from increased property values brought about by the development.)

A citizen group supported by the Clackamas County Republican Party worked to put Measure 3-386 on the ballot. This would require a majority vote countywide to create future urban renewal districts or to substantially change one. In response, the county board put competing measure 3-388 on the ballot, requiring approval only from people who live within the boundaries of a proposed urban renewal district. Neither measure affects the ability of cities within the county to form renewal areas.

""Urban renewal debt hurts Police, Fire, Schools and other services by diverting taxes that fund these critical functions across the county,"" reads a statement by the Clackamas County Republican Party. ""Measure 3-386 requires approval from Clackamas voters to determine when and where to support urban renewal. This is especially important since Clackamas County has more urban renewal debt than ALL the other Oregon counties combined. ‘A county debt deserves a county wide vote,’ stated John Lee, Chairman of the Clackamas County Republican Party.""

We were surprised by the statement. How could Clackamas County have more urban renewal development than all the other counties in Oregon combined, including Multnomah County, whose boundaries include the Portland Development Commission?  Lee challenged PolitiFact Oregon to check it out. We obliged.

We contacted the Oregon Department of Revenue, which collects property tax statistics. It turns out there are more than 70 government entities that operate more than 100 urban renewal plan areas in Oregon. In 2010-11, there was nearly $180 million in ""revenue from excess value"" collected to pay the debt on the bonds and other expenses of urban renewal projects.

But of those more than 70 entities in 2010-11, all but four are cities. In other words, very few counties have urban renewal programs. Clackamas County’s two plans generated about $9.5 million that year to pay for urban renewal. Columbia County was next with $482,000; Coos County with roughly $115,000; and Hood River County with $75,000. So yes, if you count county to county, Clackamas County collected more revenue than the other three counties combined.

Clackamas County is on par with the City of Salem, at $9 million. Wilsonville, a city within Clackamas County, is at $6.5 million. All government entities pale next to Portland, at $96 million.

Most counties do not create urban renewal areas because blight is in cities. Portland, Troutdale and Gresham -- all in Multnomah County --all use urban renewal financing to develop parts of their cities. Clackamas County, on the other hand, has more unincorporated areas.

We called Lee of the GOP. He says the statement clearly refers to the county as a government body, separate from any cities. In his defense, he does say in the statement that ""a county debt deserves a county wide vote."" That line reminds us that both ballot measures are about county-issued debt, and have nothing to do with city urban renewal projects.

But when we read the statement, we thought of Clackamas County as a geographic region, not as a government entity. Read that way, the idea that Clackamas County and all the cities inside the county would have more money tied up in urban renewal projects than Portland and Multnomah County was ridiculous. We think most people would agree with our interpretation.

We rate the statement Half True: Partially accurate, but leaving out a pretty important detail.

Michele Bachmann says U.S. spent $805 billion in Iraq, lost 4,400 lives under Barack Obama's watch
","
During an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Oct. 28, 2011, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., sought to blame President Barack Obama for the costs and lives lost in Iraq. Here’s the exchange:

Bachmann: ""My main challenger right now is Barack Obama. That's who I'm focused on. His economic policies are a disaster, and his foreign policy is even worse. Under Barack Obama's watch, we have expended $805 billion to liberate the people of Iraq and, more importantly, 4,400 American lives. President Obama just had his hat handed to him by the Iraqis, who have essentially kicked him out and our people out of Iraq while Iran is waiting in the wings. So Iraq is essentially kowtowing to Iran. Iran is seeking to have a nuclear weapon. They want to wipe Israel off the face of the map, and they want to use a nuclear weapon against the United States. And the president said sure, we'll get out. So, the president has done nothing to secure America's safety and security. He's been a disaster on foreign policy.""

Blitzer: ""But as far as Iraq is concerned, the Iraq War, which started in March 2003 -- that was President Bush and the Republicans who launched that war that went on for years. This current president is now withdrawing all of those troops from Iraq. Don't you give him credit for that?""

Bachmann: ""Wolf, the current president is being kicked out of Iraq. The president of the United States has gotten nothing.""

Blitzer: ""You want those troops to stay there?""

Bachmann: ""This is a bipartisan effort --""

Blitzer: ""Do you want those troops to stay in Iraq?""

Bachmann: ""Wolf, this was a bipartisan effort when the decision was made regarding Iraq. I wasn't in Congress at that time, but this was a bipartisan effort. This was not just a Republican effort. What President Obama has failed to do is secure the gains that America paid for with an extremely dear cost -- 4,400 American lives, nearly a trillion dollars in expenditures, and we have nothing to show for it. And we may look at (an Iraqi) government which has admitted they cannot secure the peace. …""

There’s a lot here, but we thought we’d check whether it’s accurate to say that ""under Barack Obama's watch, we have expended $805 billion to liberate the people of Iraq and, more importantly, 4,400 American lives."" After Bachmann said that, Blitzer pushed back, noting that ""the Iraq War, which started in March 2003 -- that was President Bush and the Republicans who launched that war that went on for years.""

Though Bachmann didn’t acknowledge Blitzer’s point about the timing of the war in the interview, Blitzer was right to press her.

From 2003 to early 2009, President George W. Bush was commander-in-chief overseeing Iraq. Only in January 2009 did Obama take over. So how do the statistics for money and lives break down between the two presidents?

For dollar figures, we turned to a report by the Congressional Research Service titled, ""The Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Other Global War on Terror Operations Since 9/11,"" published on March 29, 2011.

Through March 18, 2011, the cumulative enacted dollars spent on the Iraq war from fiscal year 2003 through fiscal year 2011 was $805.5 billion. So that’s where Bachmann’s figure came from. But that covers at least six fiscal years during the Bush presidency. It's a ridiculous exaggeration to attribute all that spending to Obama. (There’s been additional spending under Obama since March 18, 2011, but not nearly enough to bring his total up to $805 billion.)

For deaths, we turned to an independent monitoring organization called iCasualties.org, which is considered a credible source of such data; here’s some background on the group.

The group found that a total of 4,482 Americans have lost their lives in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003. Once again, Bachmann is close with her number but way off on attributing responsibility. Of those deaths, approximately 261 came on Obama’s watch, or about 6 percent of the total.

Our ruling

Bachmann’s numbers are essentially on target, but she errs badly in blaming Obama for all $805 billion spent and 4,400 American lives lost in Iraq ""on his watch."" Most of the money spent and lives lost in Iraq came during George W. Bush’s presidency. The idea that Obama -- who wasn’t even in the Senate until two years into the war -- is responsible for all the costs and casualties in Iraq is ridiculous.

Rick Perry says “we brought CHI Manufacturing, that had business in China, back to” Texas
","
After former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney revisited his vow to challenge China for manipulating its currency to advantage in foreign trade, Rick Perry said at the Oct. 11, 2011, Bloomberg/Washington Post Republican debate that one policy or another isn’t vital to getting more Americans back to work.

Talking up domestic energy resources, the Texas governor also said the country needs a president committed to ""pulling the regulations back, freeing this country to go develop the energy industry that we have in this country. I can promise you that we do that and we'll create an environment in this country where the manufacturing will come back to this country. We did it in Texas.  We brought CHI Manufacturing, that had business in China, back to the state of Texas.""

Among online politicos, Perry’s comment touched off Twitter mentions of Farouk Shami, a Houston hair-care mogul who sought the state’s 2010 Democratic gubernatorial nomination. In his campaign, Shami said in a TV ad that he had just brought 1,200 jobs to Texas ""by moving his factories here from China.""

Half True, we said at the time. Shami’s campaign told us that the jobs were created at a new Houston facility, CHI USA, in July 2009 as a result of moving production from South Korea, not China. Shami’s endeavors appear to be operating under the umbrella of Houston-based Farouk Systems, Inc.

Shami’s campaign said at the time that a miscommunication over where the jobs were cut led to incorrect information in the ad, which was changed after our inquiry to say that jobs were only moved from South Korea. Then-Shami spokesman Vince Leibowitz said that some jobs had been created as a result of relocating production from China, but not the ones advertised as part of Shami's campaign.

Also at the time, Elizabeth Yong, public relations manager for Houston-based Farouk Systems Group, said CHI USA produces ""five to 10"" of the company's five dozen hair care tools, including the original flat iron. Yong said bringing all production stateside would take two years, though ""more than 1,000"" jobs had already been shifted. In July 2010, the company said it hopes to shift 4,000 jobs to Texas by 2012, starting with the move of 1,000 jobs from South Korea and China.

For this review, Perry’s campaign referred us to his state office, which reminded us that Perry attended a July 30, 2009, ribbon-cutting in Houston when Farouk Systems announced its plans to shift 1,200 jobs from South Korea and China to Houston. As the Austin American-Statesman noted in a Sept. 4, 2009, news article, Perry that day called Shami someone ""who pretty much embodies the American dream.""

According to a video posted on the governor’s website, Perry also said: ""Inspired by the freedoms we enjoy, he was drawn to this state where people are still free to achieve. He's built a life of significance and an organization that is respected around the world. His is the story of Texas.""

Thanking Shami for his ""bold move,"" Perry said: ""We are celebrating a leader who is moving jobs from another country ... to Texas."" A press release issued by the governor’s office that day starts by saying that at the plant, Perry ""credited Texas’ predictable regulatory climate, low taxes and skilled workforce with attracting jobs and companies from around the world.""

Shami isn’t shown speaking in the video. He’s also not quoted in the press release.

News accounts do not mention any state role in Shami's decision to move jobs from abroad to Houston, nor is he quoted crediting a state action for prompting him to shift jobs from abroad. So why did Perry attend? ""It was a major jobs announcement in the state of Texas,"" Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed told us by email. ""He was invited.""

In describing the job moves, Shami has been quoted citing automation at the Houston plant as critical and his desire to get away from counterfeiting of his products in China, among other factors.

An Aug. 2, 2009, news article in the Houston Business Journal says Shami decided to move the manufacturing of the CHI and other Farouk Systems products from overseas to Houston for safety and economic reasons. ""Our employees are more efficient, and our quality control is superior,"" Shami said of U.S. workers. ""Plus, I’m seeing more people in other countries wanting the American lifestyle and American products. They want to buy products made in the U.S.A.""

The story further says that while conducting the manufacturing here opposed to overseas would be more expensive, Shami said other benefits would make up for the increased costs. ""We won’t have to fly products in, we won’t have to pay duties and we won’t have as many defects,"" Shami told the publication. ""We may be sacrificing some of the profit, but the increase in volume will make up for that loss in profit.""

An Aug. 6, 2010, USA Today news article quotes Shami as saying his company had spent $500,000 a month battling foreign counterfeiters who put the company's trademark on copies of its products. ""Counterfeiting is killing us,"" Shami said.

""To remedy the problem and whittle inventory costs to $50 million from $120 million,"" the story continues, the company ""moved some assembly of its irons and dryers from South Korea and China to a Houston factory that employs 1,000. Manufacturing costs in China are still about 30 percent lower. But (Shami) believes the appliances' ‘Made in the USA’ stamp will increase sales to hair salons.""

In a recent telephone interview, Farouk Systems spokeswoman Amy Johnson told us the Houston plant has 1,200 jobs with 300 additional jobs to be added soon.

Johnson also told us that some limited-edition hair irons are still made in China. In earlier years, she said, 40 percent of the company’s products were made here, 60 percent overseas. Now, she said, the split is 80 percent here, 20 percent overseas. ""We’re definitely happy to be a positive example,"" she said.

We asked Johnson for details about how many jobs have shifted from China to Texas and how either the Texas economy or actions by Texas state government encouraged those moves. She replied that Shami wanted to talk to us, but we did not hear from him.

Ironing all this out, it seems likely the manufacturer of the CHI hair iron moved some jobs from China to Texas. However, there’s no indication that qualities specific to the Texas economy or actions by state government merit credit for the shift. It could be, too, that most of the moved jobs came from South Korea.

In any event, CHI still has products made in China. Ultimately, Perry’s statement overreaches by indicating the company deserted China and by claiming that anyone besides Shami ""brought"" the jobs from abroad.

George LeMieux says Adam Hasner got an ""F"" from Christian Coalition
","
Is Republican U.S. Senate candidate Adam Hasner a failure according to the Christian Coalition?

That's what one of Hasner's primary opponents, George LeMieux, wants voters to think. A video we saw on LeMieux's website, www.phonyconservative.com, on Oct. 5, 2011, picks apart Hasner's record as a former state legislator:

""In politics talk is cheap. Voting records matter. Career politician Adam Hasner wants you to think he is a conservative,"" states the sinister voice as images of Hasner speaking in the Legislature appear on the screen. ""Small problem. His record. Hasner used to describe himself as a 'moderate' because his support for stem cell research, his attempt to weaken pro-life laws and his opposition to expanding school vouchers. The Christian Coalition gave Hasner an F...."" states the voice as the screen flashes to a 2007 report card highlighting that Hasner scored 57.1.

In a related Truth-O-Meter item, we looked into LeMieux's accusations that Hasner tried to weaken pro-life laws and opposed expanding vouchers.

Here we're wondering about that ""F"" for Hasner, who is trying to tout his conservative credentials. Ouch. Does this LeMieux claim make the grade?

The Christian Coalition of Florida is a conservative organization that takes stances on several social and economic issues -- including opposing abortion, gay marriage and pornography. The organization publishes a report card of state legislators annually and grades them on multiple issues and gives legislators an ""x"" when they vote against the Coalition's stance and a checkmark if they vote in favor of the Coalition's stance. The Coalition then tallies the legislator's votes and calculates a numerical grade. For example, the 2009 report card evaluated how legislators voted on bills pertaining to bestiality, criminal history screening for sports coaches, Internet safety at public libraries, preventing homelessness and other laws.

Hasner was elected in 2002 and served until 2010. As of Oct. 27, 2011, the Coalition hadn't yet posted a 2010 report card so we examined Hasner's report cards for 2003 to 2009:

2003: 83
2003-04: 82 
2005: 100
2005-06: 92.3 
2007: 57.1
2008: 100
2009: 78.6 
Some of the report cards overlap. For instance, the Christian Coalition evaluated legislators in 2003 and then created a two-year scorecard for 2003 and 2004. The same for 2005 and 2005-06. We could not reach anyone from the Christian Coalition by telephone or e-mail for an explanation of the overlapping years. 
A note about the Coalition's status: It still exists but is for now is operating under the same leadership as the Florida Faith and Freedom Coalition, said Brett Doster, a board member of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. Doster founded Front Line Strategies, a public relations firm in Tallahassee that works with conservative candidates and organizations.  

Because some votes essentially are counted twice, we can't create an average score for Hasner during his time in the Legislature. However, Hasner got a perfect 100 percent twice and scored an ""A"" in a third year. He has two ""B"" years, one ""C"" and one ""F.""

That's the ""F"" LeMieux is talking about. So what happened that year?

The Christian Coalition gave Hasner an ""F"" for voting in favor of a slew of gambling measures that the coalition opposed. Hasner was at odds with the coalition on six of 14 votes. 

Hasner voted in favor of these gambling bills in 2007:

Senate Bill 134: Allows cardrooms to conduct games of dominoes
Senate Bill 500: Provides requirements for operation of instant bingo games
Senate Bill 752: Revises hours of operation for card rooms
House Bill 1047 and Amendment to House bill 1047: A pro-slot machine gaming measure
Amendment to Senate Bill 1376: The bill itself granted the Department of Lottery authority to obtain patents.

Hasner adviser Rick Wilson pointed out that LeMieux cannot cast himself as an opponent of gaming. LeMieux, a former chief of staff to Gov. Charlie Crist, helped shape the state's gaming deal with the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times reported April 23, 2011. But that's not what we're checking here.

The LeMieux video correctly states that Hasner received an ""F"" from the Christian Coalition. But that only accounts for one-seventh of Hasner's report cards from the coalition. To provide an accurate picture requires examining all of his report cards. 
Also, the video's statement about the Christian Coalition grade is preceded by claims about Hasner's stances on stem cell research, abortion and school vouchers and it could create a false impression that those are the reasons the Christian Coalition gave him an F. But that wasn't the case. The Coalition flunked Hasner in 2007 due to his pro-gambling votes. 
And the Coalition wasn't exactly impressed with the rest of the House either -- it gave state representatives on average the equivalent of a D-minus that year.  Failing grades were passed out to Republican Reps. Carlos Lopez-Cantera (now majority leader) and Jennifer Carroll (now lieutenant governor). 
Our ruling 
Hasner did receive an ""F"" grade from the Christian Coalition in 2007, but LeMieux's video leaves out important details of Hasner's record. We rate this claim  Half True. ",/factchecks/2011/oct/31/george-lemieux/georg-lemieux-says-adam-hasner-got-f-christian-coa/

NRA says Wisconsin’s concealed-carry permit rules require more proof than other states
","
Firearm-rights advocates were thrilled in July 2011 when Wisconsin passed a concealed-carry law described as the fifth-best in the U.S. from their viewpoint. At the time, the state was one of only two that did not allow people to carry concealed weapons.

But folks on both sides of the expressed concerns while awaiting detailed rules on how to get a permit.  The law takes effect Nov. 1, 2011.

The NRA was upset at rumors that Wisconsin’s Department of Justice would require live-fire training and mandate at least four hours of safety instruction overall. Meanwhile, critics feared that online video courses might be deemed enough to get a permit.

Some of those rumors were unfounded -- permit applicants need not fire a gun (as in Minnesota), and training must be face-to-face with a certified instructor. The four-hour length was approved, though, in the emergency rulesissued by Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen.

Nevertheless, despite the specific rules that drew criticism from gun advocates, Wisconsin’s overall law is still in the Top 10 for ease of access to permits, according to Nik Clark, head of Wisconsin Carry Inc., a nonprofit gun-rights organization.

Something little discussed in the back-and-forth was the fact that applicants can get permits even if their training was years ago.

And that’s where the National Rifle Association comes in. The NRA remains unhappy about an issue related to proving an applicant has received past training.

In a lobbying alert to its members on Oct.15, 2011, the group’s legislative arm said the state Justice Department overstepped by requiring too much information on the certificates needed as proof of firearms safety training.

""No training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the Wisconsin DOJ demands,"" the NRA alert said. ""This renders all existing certificates insufficient for submission with a citizen’s license application.  DOJ could have easily established a system that would have allowed existing training certificates to be submitted while ensuring that the requirements of the concealed weapons law are met.""

The NRA contends some would-be applicants will be discouraged, or will not be able to track down their instructors to get the required proof (for instance, if an instructor died or moved away). It argues in those cases applicants will have to get retrained because of DOJ’s ""demands.""

What are those demands, and are they unique to the Wisconsin rules?

The NRA could not provide a state-by-state comparison to back up its claim, so we did a brief survey of states based on governmental and private research. We also interviewed firearms safety trainers.

So let’s get armed with some facts.

We will not focus on what proof is needed in the case of military, law enforcement or security firearms training, or hunter education courses. The dispute is over proof of training run by groups such as the NRA and other state and national organizations.

In that case, the DOJ rules require: 
  

Based on our check of permit rules around the country, it’s not hard to find states that require some of the same things Wisconsin requires.

We learned of certificates of training that required confirmation of the course length (Missouri); the instructor’s name and signature (Michigan, Florida, Minnesota); and a statement attesting to the course meeting state law (Michigan) -- the same things Wisconsin requires.

And it’s not hard to find states that seek similar items -- Utah requires instructors to stamp the application, for instance.

On the other hand, we could find no state that required all of what Wisconsin is seeking. The instructor contact information, in particular, is unusual on the graduation certificate. Some states -- not including Wisconsin -- directly certify instructors and their courses, giving them access to the same information.

""You’re on your own over there,"" said Gary Shade, of Shade’s Landing, a personal protection and firearms training company in Apple Valley, Minnesota.

In addition to Shade, we spoke with Bill Schmitz, of BDJ, Ltd. in Redgranite, Wis.; Tim Grant, of American Association of Certified Firearms Instructors; and Michael Bender of the Personal Protection Academy in Madison. All said they would have to re-do their certificates because of the Wisconsin rules.

Some complained about it; others said it was no big deal.

The proof requirements directly affect NRA trainers, who along with instructors from other organizations will have to re-work and re-issue their graduation certificates to meet the specific Wisconsin rules, our research found.

This summer, after the law passed but before Van Hollen’s rule came out in October, some people jumped the gun and got trained with less than four hours of instruction or got trained through online courses, according to our interviews with several training companies.

Others got enough training but were handed certificates that don’t include all the required information. There is time and expense involved for trainees and instructors in going back at this.

Van Hollen says the rules are reasonable and an anti-fraud move.

""The DOJ’s requirements for training certificates allow instructors to verify that the permit applicant named on the certificate actually took the course,"" DOJ spokeswoman Dana Brueck told us. ""Given the Legislature required ‘proof’ of training, it only makes sense to have the instructor sign the document.""

Brueck said the course location verifies the training was face to face.

A final point:

We found that evaluating the NRA assertion that ""no training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the Wisconsin DOJ demands"" is a matter of how you read the statement.

Does the group mean nobody else asks for ""any"" of the information Wisconsin does, or that, taken as a whole, no other state seeks all of what we do? NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said it was the latter.

Our conclusion

The NRA claimed that ""no training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the Wisconsin DOJ demands.""

We found elements in common with what other states require, as well as some that appear to be unique to Wisconsin’s rules on certificates. We think it’s reasonable to interpret the NRA claim as meaning no other state asks for as much as we do on the certificate, so that part of the statement is basically accurate with some clarification.

The group also said the DOJ rules render all existing graduation certificates ""insufficient for submission with a citizen’s license application.""

There’s ample evidence that is true for courses run by organizations such as the NRA. The NRA’s overall point is a technical one, but requires some clarification.

More dangerous in Milwaukee than in 96% of the nation?
","Resentment and recrimination often characterize political relations between Milwaukee and the rest of Wisconsin. In the latest clash, the Milwaukee Public Schools board thwarted an effort by Republican state lawmakers to reform the low-performing district. That led the GOP leader of the Senate to say the Legislature might respond by cutting the district’s funding. About two weeks later, on July 10, 2016, another GOP lawmaker issued a broadside against largely Democratic Milwaukee. State Sen. Van Wanggaard of Racine wrote an opinion piece in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that was laden with statistical claims unfavorable to the city -- including one making a national comparison about crime that we want to check. ""Recent complaints from Milwaukee leaders about their lack of state funding are misguided and lack perspective,"" the column began. ""Unfortunately,"" Wanggaard later wrote, ""the only way to cut this expenditure is to reduce the number of people needing assistance — reducing poverty. But the failing school system and Milwaukee's crime problem prevent that."" Then came the claim we’re interested in, with Wanggaard saying ""you're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country."" Milwaukee is known for a relatively high violent crime rate. But this way of expressing that has some problems. Trends in violent crime Across the country, crime has been on a downward trend. That’s what PolitiFact National reported in June 2016 in rating as Pants on Fire Donald Trump’s claim that ""crime is rising."" With regard to violent crime, our colleagues checked FBI figures through 2014, the latest year for which complete figures are available. They found that nationally, the rates of violent crime per 100,000 people have been falling on an almost uninterrupted basis since the early 1990s. As counted by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR), violent crime includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Milwaukee’s violent crime rate has been among the highest among large cities. In 2014, there were 8,864 violent crimes reported in the city, according to the FBI figures. That was up 8 percent from 8,194 in 2013. Now, to Wanggaard’s claim. Wanggaard’s evidence To back the statement, Wanggaard’s staff cited rankings from two websites that rank places to live. Each used the FBI’s UCR violent crime figures for 2014. AreaVibes.com says Milwaukee is safer than 4 percent of the cities in the United States. Another way to say that would be that Milwaukee’s violent crime rate is higher than 96 percent of the country. NeighborhoodScout.com says the figure is 3 percent.  Michael O’Hear, a law professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, told us the rankings give some basis for Wanggaard’s 96 percent claim. But O’Hear and other criminal justice experts told us there are problems with the claim. ""It’s sort of a dubious measure on so many grounds,"" said Alfred Blumstein, an emeritus professor of urban systems and operations research Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Comparison problems 1. UCR figures are solid. But the FBI ""strongly discourages"" using them to make rankings to evaluate different communities, saying: ""These incomplete analyses have often created misleading perceptions which adversely affect geographic entities and their residents. For this reason, the FBI has a long-standing policy against ranking participating law enforcement agencies on the basis of crime data alone … many factors cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place."" 2. Across the country, violent crime generally is concentrated in larger cities, so it stands to reason there is less violent crime in most parts of the country. But the figures used in the website rankings compare Milwaukee with cities such as Mount Pleasant near Racine (15 violent crimes in 2014) and Sun Prairie (32) near Madison that have a population as low as 25,000. ""There’s a world of difference between a city of 25,000 and a city the size of Milwaukee (population 600,000),"" O’Hear said. 3. Violent crime in Milwaukee is concentrated in certain neighborhoods, while other neighborhoods carry no more risk of violent crime than many suburban neighborhoods. In other words, you’re not suddenly at great risk of being a violent crime victim simply by crossing the city limits. ""Usually if you’re not hanging out"" in high-crime neighborhoods, ""your chances of being a victim of crime are pretty low,"" said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the City University of New York Institute for State & Local Governance. Our rating Wanggaard said: ""You're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country."" Three rankings using violent crime rates from the FBI give Milwaukee such a ranking. But the FBI warns against using its figures to do rankings; the rankings compare Milwaukee to relatively tiny cities; and the claim makes a broad claim about Milwaukee but ignores the fact that most violent crime in the city is limited to certain neighborhoods.

Tammy Duckworth says Mark Kirk called for the 'mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans'
","In the hotly contested Illinois U.S. Senate race, Democratic challenger Tammy Duckworth is doing everything she can to link Republican incumbent Mark Kirk to Donald Trump. Even after Kirk said he would not support Trump on June 7, the Duckworth camp kept at it in this tweet:  That's a packed tweet. Is it true that Kirk called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African-Americans and, second, that Kirk had no objection to Trump’s call for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants? We checked the record. What Kirk said Duckworth's deputy campaign manager Matt McGrath said in an email she was referencing a statement Kirk made in May 2013 during an interview with Fox 32 Chicago political editor Mike Flannery. Kirk told Flannery: ""My top priority is to arrest the Gangster Disciple gang, which is 18,000 people. I would like to do a mass pickup of them and put them all in the Thomson Correctional Facility. I will be proposing this to the assembled federal law enforcement: ATF, DEA and FBI.""  Kirk made that statement in response to the January 2013 shooting death of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, who was struck in the back by a stray bullet during a gang-related shooting on Chicago’s south side. The Gangster Disciples is an African-American gang from the city's south side and has an estimated 18,000 members, though its membership could be as high as 30,000, according to the Chicago Crime Commission’s press officer John Pastuovic. The statement drew criticism from the media as well as from Kirk’s colleagues in Congress, including U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill, who called the proposal an ""upper middle class elitist white boy solution to a problem he knows nothing about."" But Kirk acknowledged in July 2013 that his plan to arrest every member of the Gangster Disciples was ""not actually that practical."" Still, not only does Duckworth's tweet take what Kirk said out of context, it also implies he supported the general mass arrest of 18,000 African-Americans, even though Kirk never mentioned race or used the term ""African-Americans"" during his interview with Fox 32 Chicago. What about Kirk on deportation? And as for Duckworth’s claim that Kirk ""was apparently fine with Trump’s call for mass deportation?"" On May 4, Trump appeared on NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt, where he reiterated his plan to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants if he were to become president. In a May 6 interview with CNN before Trump’s primary-clinching win in Indiana, Kirk said he would support Trump as the Republican nominee, calling Trump’s candidacy a ""net benefit"" for his own campaign in Illinois. Kirk withdrew his support for the presumptive GOP presidential nominee on June 7 after Trump said an American-born federal judge of Mexican ancestry couldn’t preside fairly over civil fraud lawsuits against the defunct Trump University because he has called for a wall to be built along the U.S.-Mexico border. While Kirk did back Trump knowing his position on illegal immigration, Kirk has made clear in the past he does not support Trump’s controversial immigration policies. In July 2015, Kirk told reporters at news conference he had a message for Trump: ""In a typical Chicago way, to my Mexican-American friends, I would say, 'Donald Trump callate' shut up."" And Kirk’s congressional voting record suggests he would not be ""fine"" with deporting 11 million immigrants living here illegally. Eleni Demertzis, the Kirk campaign’s communications director, noted in an email the senator supported and voted for the high-profile comprehensive immigration reform package in June 2013, which first would have secured the border and then created a tough but fair pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, among other things. But that measure never made it to a vote in the House. In addition to his pro-immigration reform stance, Kirk in October 2015 broke ranks with his party and was the only GOP Senator who voted to preserve federal funding for ""sanctuary cities."" However, Kirk did vote in favor of increasing penalties from two years to five years for illegal immigrants who re-enter the country illegally after being deported, denied entry or removed for other reasons, voting largely along party lines. Our ruling Duckworth tweeted: ""Kirk, who called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans, was apparently fine with Trump’s #StillTooRacist call for mass deportation."" While Kirk did call for the mass arrest of the Gangster Disciples, an African-American gang estimated to have 18,000 members, Duckworth’s tweet takes Kirk’s statement out of context and gives the impression he had called for the general mass incarceration of 18,000 African-Americans. Duckworth also fails to acknowledge Kirk walked back his statement shortly after he made it. More importantly, Kirk did not mention race when he originally called for a ""mass pickup"" of the Gangster Disciples gang. As for Kirk being ""apparently fine"" with mass deportation, his congressional voting record on immigration shows he supports comprehensive reform that would both improve border security and implement a tough, but fair pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants -- not to mention he was the lone Republican senator to vote against legislation that would have withheld federal funds from sanctuary cities.

Barack Obama offers flawed comparison between teens' ease in obtaining Glocks vs. books
","President Barack Obama attracted attention for a bold assertion about how easy it is to obtain a gun during his speech at an interfaith memorial service for five officers slain by a sniper in Dallas, Texas. ""As a society, we choose to underinvest in decent schools,"" he said. ""We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment. We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental health programs. We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book, and then we tell the police, ‘You’re a social worker, you’re the parent, you’re the teacher, you’re the drug counselor.’"" Critics pounced on the Glock remark, saying Obama was making a misleading — or even outright false — comparison. But the White House said it had evidence to back up Obama’s line. So we decided to take our own look. What the White House says The White House offered PolitiFact several news reports to back up Obama’s case. The gist of these reports was that there are lots of guns to be found in low-income urban areas, but comparatively few books and relatively little access to the Internet. However, much of the evidence these articles provided was anecdotal, and none of the articles directly compared guns to computers or books --- not to mention Glocks, the specific make of handgun Obama cited. And none of the articles offered a rigorous academic comparison of the specific claim Obama made. For example: • One study by New York University researchers found a scarcity of children’s books in low-income areas of Detroit, Los Angeles and Washington. But the study looked at stores that sold books without taking into account public libraries or school libraries, which make obtaining books easier. More importantly, the study didn’t compare the availability of guns. • Several articles offered quotes by people familiar with low-income communities that included observations similar to what Obama said in Dallas. For instance, one Chicago resident told Al Jazeera America that getting a gun in her neighborhood is as easy as buying a pack of gum. ""If you want a gun, you can just go get a gun,"" she said. ""You got the money? You can get a gun."" And D. Watkins, a young, African-American writer from Baltimore who wrote The Beast Side: Living and Dying While Black in America, told public radio host Terry Gross that he bought his first gun ""from some dudes in the neighborhood that sold guns. It was simple. ... (It was) Business as usual. And it's still like that."" None of these accounts offered a direct comparison of guns’ availability compared with books or Internet access. • One link referenced an academic study about a lack of access to food in low-income areas, but it did not address either guns or books. • A news report cited research about the relative lack of Internet access in low-income households. But another article the White House provided said that while teens in families making less than $50,000 a year are less likely to have access to a desktop or a laptop computer than teens in higher income groups, the rate even for the lower-income group is still pretty high: All told, eight of every 10 of these lower-income teens had access to a computer. In all, we find the White House’s evidence unpersuasive on Obama’s specific claim. There’s no hard data making his comparison. And on the question of access to computers, we found data showing a relatively high rate of Internet access even among lower-income teens. Problems with the comparisons We considered the meaning of Obama’s remark a few different ways — but none provide a slam dunk for his argument. He said it was easier for a teen to obtain a Glock over a book or a computer. It might be easier for some people in some places, but it’s still against the law. ""It is already against federal law for someone under the age of 21 to buy a handgun, such as a Glock, from a licensed firearms dealer,"" said John R. Lott, Jr., president of the generally pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center. And federal law on handguns also makes it unlawful for anyone ""to sell, deliver, or otherwise transfer (a handgun) to a person who the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a juvenile"" — that is, under 18. That means that any teen would have to break the law to make such a purchase. Alternately, they could barter for a handgun or steal one, which might be practical but would also be against the law. So let’s now consider the case of teens who are willing to break the law. One interpretation is whether a gun is cheaper to get than a book. Experts said the price of a ""street"" handgun can range between $50 and $500, depending on the local vagaries of supply and demand. Glocks in particular ""are very expensive,"" said Alan Lizotte, a criminal justice professor at the University at Albany. Street Glocks without a criminal history would be especially tough, he said. That would make them easily more expensive than books purchased at a store, and certainly more expensive than books borrowed for free from a library. ""There are 80 public libraries in Chicago and 95 public high schools and 92 private high schools in the city,"" Lott said. The second interpretation of Obama’s remark is the ease, or accessibility, of locating a gun. This is perhaps the most favorable interpretation for Obama, since credible research shows that there’s both a relative shortage of books and a relative surplus of guns in low-income neighborhoods. But it’s worth remembering that there don’t appear to be any studies that compare books and guns directly. In addition, there’s a lot of variation, neighborhood by neighborhood, across the country. ""If there’s lots of street-gang activity where you live, you may know someone who can get you a gun,"" said James Alan Fox, interim director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. ""If you live in a middle- or upper-middle class suburb, a gun may not be as accessible for a teenager. I wouldn’t know who to ask to buy a street gun."" Some points for Obama Experts acknowledged, though, that Obama had a point with his remark, even if he made an imperfect comparison. ""It is pretty easy for a teen to get a handgun at little cost and very quickly, at least in some places, including urban places,"" Lizotte said. That said, Jay Corzine, a sociologist and gun-policy expert at the University of Central Florida, called Obama’s framing ""weird."" ""The most credit I can give the president is that the statement may be true in a very small number of cases that are dependent on the context -- location, day of the week, time of the day, cash in hand,"" Corzine said. Our ruling Obama said, ""We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book."" There’s little doubt that in some lower-income and high-crime neighborhoods, it is strikingly easy for even teens to acquire a handgun. On this, there is ample anecdotal evidence. But buying a gun is not likely to be cheaper than buying -- or borrowing -- a book or securing access to a computer, even for teens in poor neighborhoods. On multiple levels, Obama’s comparison is flawed. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/jul/14/barack-obama/barack-obama-offers-flawed-comparison-between-teen/

Pence falsely says Clinton didn't 'send help' during Benghazi attack
","Vice presidential nominees are often expected to act as attack dogs on a campaign ticket. Maybe Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was warming up for the role at a rally for Donald Trump in Indiana on July 12. Pence rattled off a series of reasons Hillary Clinton was not fit for the presidency. One of them caught our attention, a claim about Benghazi, the Libyan city where a 2012 terrorist attack left four Americans dead. ""We don't need a president that took 13 hours to send help to Americans under fire and after four brave Americans fell said ‘what difference, at this point, does it make.’ Anyone who did that, anyone who said that, should be disqualified from ever being commander in chief of the armed forces,"" Pence said. President Barack Obama’s administration has been subject to a great deal of scrutiny during, before and after that attack, and much of that has been directed at Clinton. Several investigations have found, however, that no action by Clinton -- or anybody in the administration -- could have moved additional forces to Benghazi before the last American deaths. And if it were possible, Clinton was not responsible for sending help. That fell to military officials. The Benghazi timeline The attack on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi began at 9:40 p.m., Benghazi time. It took until after 10 a.m. the next morning for the last plane evacuating Americans to leave Benghazi — the time from the initial attack to the final evacuation is Pence’s ""13 hours."" (For a more detailed timeline, see this document issued by the House’s select committee on Benghazi or our fact-check of a claim about delays in the military’s response.) At an 11 p.m. meeting (5 p.m. Washington time), President Barack Obama directed military officials to ""do everything possible"" to save lives in Benghazi. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testified that he then ordered forces around the Mediterranean to move toward Libya. Clinton’s department was ultimately responsible for the security setup at the Benghazi mission, but at this point it was the military, under the Defense Department and, ultimately, the president, that was moving forces toward Libya. None of the forces ordered to prepare to deploy to Benghazi ever reached the city in the aftermath of the attack. Eventually, it was decided that the Americans in Benghazi would evacuate to Tripoli, Libya's capital, and forces that would have gone to Benghazi were directed there, Libya’s capital, where they were being evacuated to. The CIA station chief in Tripoli — as opposed to anyone in Washington — dispatched a team to work with local militia groups to extract the Americans in Benghazi. Clinton was active throughout the 13-hour period. She testified that she called Libya’s president to see if friendly forces could be dispatched to help the Americans in Benghazi. She also spoke with the embassy in Tripoli and then-CIA director David Petraeus. There have been eight congressional investigations of Benghazi so far, most of which were run by Republicans. Several of their reports criticized Clinton and her State Department for the security setup in Benghazi, for their part in the administration messaging after the attack, and for not holding themselves accountable afterward. But they generally criticized the Defense Department or other parts of the administration, not Clinton or the State Department, for delays in deploying military assets the night of the attack. When Congressman Mike Pompeo asked Clinton, ""Why was heaven and earth not moved at the initial sound of guns,"" in terms of sending help, Clinton told him to ask the Defense Department. The House select committee on Benghazi concluded: ""The decisions made earlier in the year by senior State Department officials to maintain a presence in Benghazi without adequate security forces and an inadequately fortified Mission compound contributed to what amounted to a worst case scenario of circumstances that would test the military’s preparedness and ability to respond. ""Nevertheless, the Defense Department did not pass the test."" The committee went on to question why it took so long for orders from Obama and Panetta to translate into action on the ground. The committee’s final report leaves open the possibility that the State Department might have further impeded the speed of reaction to Benghazi. ""Whether this failure is shouldered by (the Defense Department) alone, or rests in part on decisions made by the State Department in Washington D.C. or with the White House... is one of the lingering questions about Benghazi,"" the report reads. This brings up the possibility that the State Department delayed help, but that wasn’t Pence’s claim. And, based on the generally accepted timeline of the attack, its appears likely the delay ended up being immaterial.  Different Republican-led congressional investigations have concluded that additional forces could not have reached Benghazi in time to matter. Even if Clinton was responsible for the response to the attack, it's not clear what she could have done to overcome what military officials called ""the tyranny of time and distance."" Our ruling Pence claimed that Clinton ""took 13 hours to send help to Americans under fire."" In fact, it wasn’t Clinton’s responsibility to send troops to the scene — the military chain of command took that responsibility. The Defense Department attempted to send help to the scene, but was unable to reach Benghazi before the deaths occurred. Pence implied that Clinton dawdled before sending help to Americans in danger. That is not accurate.

Mike Pence offers misleading statistic on employment peak in Indiana
","At what was widely seen as a vice presidential tryout, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence warmed up a Donald Trump rally in his home state on July 12, 2016. Pence took the opportunity in the national spotlight to tout the health of his state’s economy, saying, ""Today, there are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before in the 200-year history of the great state of Indiana."" With Pence potentially on the verge of becoming Trump’s running mate, we decided to take a closer look at what Pence said. We discovered that the statistic, as Pence stated it, is accurate — but close to meaningless. Pence has a point that more people in Indiana are working today than at any time in history -- 3.07 million in May 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s a chart showing BLS data for Indiana as far back as the database goes online:  However, the historical peak Pence cites has more to do with long-term population growth than with the robustness of the economy. The more accurate way to look at a statement like this is to look at the percentage of people working, not the raw number. Otherwise, you could say that President Barack Obama at the depths of the Great Recession was presiding over a healthier job market than Ronald Reagan in his second term, because 25 percent more Americans were working at the nadir of the Great Recession. The difference was that the base U.S. population -- rather than job prospects -- grew substantially in the interim. As a general rule, ""focusing on the total number of people employed is misleading,"" said Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs site Indeed. So let’s take a look at what happens if you calculate the percentage of the Indiana population that is working. According to the Census Bureau’s 2015 population estimate — the most recent one available — Indiana has a population of about 6.48 million. So 47.3 percent of Indiana residents were working this year. By contrast, at the previous raw-number peak in Indiana employment -- May 2000 -- there were 3.02 million residents working. That year, the state had 6.08 million residents, so the percentage working was 49.7 percent. In other words, a bigger percentage of Indiana’s population was working in 2000 than in 2016. That throws some cold water on Pence’s assertion. These calculations use all Indiana residents as a baseline, regardless of age, but the same pattern holds if you just look at Indiana residents between the ages of 18 and 64, the prime working years. Currently, 75.4 percent of Indiana residents in that age range are working. In 2000, the comparable figure was 80.5 percent. So by this measure, too, Pence is wrong about 2016 representing a historical peak. Then there’s the more traditional measure of the health of the job market, the unemployment rate. This statistic uses as its baseline the number of people who are looking for a job, which makes it even more precise and in most cases more useful to economists. Indiana’s current rate of 5 percent is what experts would generally consider good, but it’s hardly a historical low for Indiana. For most of the time between 1993 and 2008, Indiana’s unemployment was right around 5 percent and often even lower. Here’s a chart going back to 1976:  Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, noticed another pattern in the numbers. He used federal data to determine that even though the state’s working-age population grew by 311,000 between 2000 and 2015, the number of people actually working in the state increased by far less over that period -- only 45,400. That does not seem like an obvious sign of a strong employment trend. Our ruling Pence said, ""Today, there are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before in the 200-year history of the great state of Indiana."" Literally, Pence has a point: More Indiana residents are employed now than at any time in the past. But it’s a data point with very little meaning, since, as any statistician will tell you, it doesn’t take into account the size of the state’s population. Looking instead at the percentage of Hoosiers working shows that the percentage was higher during the previous employment peak in 2000. And the widely used unemployment rate — which is even more precise because it is based on the number of residents who are actively looking for a job — has been lower than its current rate over long stretches of recent history.

Rival claims John McCain visited Pakistan to sell weapons to 'folks who harbored Osama bin Laden'
","Sen. John McCain's primary challenger accused him of selling military weapons to allies of Osama bin Laden, on the Fourth of July of all weekends. The campaign of former state Sen.

It included this graphic:  McCain did go to Pakistan that holiday weekend, as well as Afghanistan for his annual visit to American troops on Independence Day. But is Ward right that he carved out time to sell F-16 fighter jets, which are used for aerial attacks, and sophisticated weaponry to ""the folks who harbored Osama bin Laden"" in Pakistan?

The meeting was billed as an effort to strengthen relations between the two countries and defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.  While ISIS does not have a major presence in Pakistan, the United States has expressed concern over indirect connections between the terror group and Pakistani militants.   At the meeting, McCain emphasized that Pakistan needs to do more to take on terrorist groups, such as the Haqqani Network, an insurgency group with ties to al-Qaeda and Pakistan, that threaten America, according to his spokeswoman. She also said McCain’s visit was within his oversight as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. So the point of the delegation's visit was not to make a deal on aircrafts — especially since Congress had balked at a military proposal for the United States to finance eight fighter jets for Pakistan. The stumbling block: Pakistan's terrorism ties. ""Sen. McCain conveyed to Pakistani leaders that U.S. financing for those (F-16) aircrafts will not be supported by Congress unless and until Pakistan demonstrates more robust efforts against terrorists that threaten America,"" McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero said. F-16s The United States has sold F-16s to Pakistan for decades. But after the U.S. military approved the sale of eight F-16s to Pakistan in February, congressional leaders said they would block U.S. financing and Pakistan would have to pay for the F-16s with its own money. ""Given congressional opposition to financing the F-16 sale with Foreign Military Financing (FMF), we asked the Pakistanis to fund the sale entirely,"" said State Department spokesman Josh Paul. ""Pakistan did not accept this offer, and the terms of the sale have expired."" McCain wanted a hearing on the F-16s then, saying he was ""conflicted"" with the proposed sale, noting potential consequences in the U.S.-India relationship. (There was concern that Pakistan could use the weapons against India.) Romero reiterated that McCain can only see a scenario where the United States finances F-16s is if Pakistan bolsters its anti-terrorism efforts. Ward’s campaign cited Pakistan news website Business Recorder, which quotes Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman Nafees Zakaria as saying McCain’s visit was related to ""defense cooperation."" The Ward campaign also referenced a June 24 meeting between McCain and former Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari in Los Angeles. McCain’s campaign confirmed this meeting, saying it was part of his regular meetings with world leaders. A Pakistani government account of the meeting recounts Zardari making the case for American F-16s and drones to fight terrorists. Sebastian also noted that most of the senator’s itinerary was not available in advance because of security concerns. McCain’s daily schedule is not released publicly. ""While F-16s and weapon sales were not the only, or even primary, purpose of the CoDel (congressional delegation) trip, it certainly seems to have been a prominent part of the agenda,"" he said. That's a much softer take than the message of the campaign ad. Pakistan on terror Now for the Ward attack's characterization of Pakistan as the ""folks who harbored Osama bin Laden."" Yes, bin Laden was found and killed at a compound in Pakistan in 2011. But University of Michigan history professor Juan Cole, who has written extensively about the Middle East, questioned the graphic’s portrayal of Pakistan in the terrorism fight. ""The implication is that Pakistan is an enemy of the U.S., whereas it is designated as a non-NATO ally,"" Cole said. ""McCain's trip is not about arms sales but broader diplomacy."" Pakistan has a mixed history dealing with terrorism, despite aiding in the 2003 capture of suspected 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shiekh Mohammed. ""Pakistan has failed to attack, and in some cases even provided support and safe haven to a variety of other militant/terrorist groups, including the Haqqani Network and Lashkar-e-Taiba, that have attacked U.S. troops in Afghanistan and have killed U.S. citizens in India,"" said Daniel Markey, an international relations professor at Johns Hopkins University. Pakistan does have an Anti-Terrorism Act, which was established in 1997. But the U.S. Institute of Peace even concludes in a August 2015 report that it offers a ""very weak deterrence"" against terrorism, as conviction rates remain low. ""Pakistan has a lot of problems, it has not been a great ally,"" said Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Alyssa Ayres. ""(But) it also is the supply route to support our troops in Afghanistan."" As for the accusation that McCain was engineering a sale to people who ""harbored"" bin Laden, that is also unproven. Ward’s campaign referenced a October 2015 Washington Post story that quotes Pakistan’s former defense minister as saying it was ""probable"" that the Pakistani military knew of bin Laden’s whereabouts. But Markey said the ad's claim jumps too far. ""We don't yet have evidence that top Pakistani military or civilian leaders knew of bin Laden's whereabouts or ‘harbored’ him, as it says in the graphic,"" he said. Our ruling  Ward said McCain was in Pakistan during the Fourth of July weekend selling ""F-16s and advanced weapons"" to the folks who ""harbored Osama bin Laden."" Experts we spoke with disagreed. The ad distorts McCain’s mission in Pakistan to stir up questions about his patriotism.  While McCain has discussed F-16 fighter jets with Pakistani officials, the meeting over the holiday weekend was part of a larger effort to fight terrorism. Further, the ad oversimplifies Pakistan's complicated relationship with the United States. There is plenty of legitimate concern about the country's approach to terrorist groups, but there is no definitive proof that Pakistan (particularly the ones who met with McCain) harbored bin Laden. We rate Ward’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/76ddba0b-4e0a-4071-b0aa-a23573c3cc48",/factchecks/2016/jul/14/kelli-ward/image-claims-john-mccain-visited-pakistan-sell-wea/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Gary Johnson']","
Libertarian candidate says Mexican immigrants more law-abiding than U.S. citizens
","Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson challenged Donald Trump’s label of Mexican immigrants as murderers and rapists, saying they actually follow the law more than U.S. citizens. In a July 3 interview on CNN’s State of the Union, Johnson spoke with host Brianna Keilar about comments the presumptive Republican nominee has made about Muslims and Mexicans. Johnson, a former New Mexico governor, said Trump has said things that would disqualify anyone else from running for president. Keilar asked Johnson if he thought Trump was racist. ""When it comes to Mexican immigration and that he would call immigrants from Mexico murderers and rapists look, that’s just not true,"" Johnson said. ""They are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens, and that is a statistic."" We wondered if there really was a statistic to support Johnson’s statement that Mexican immigrants commit fewer crimes than U.S. citizens. Immigrants up, crime down Johnson based his comments on data cited in a July 2015 Wall Street Journal opinion piece by Jason L. Riley, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute. Riley’s commentary focused on studies that show immigrants — irrespective of nationality or legal status — ""are less likely than the native population to commit violent crimes or to be incarcerated."" Riley points to a July 2015 report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit in Washington. The council analyzed data from the Census’ 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of all immigrant males (Census does not specify legal status) between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population. The council also reported 2010 Census data that shows incarceration rates of young, less educated Mexican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan men — which comprise the bulk of the unauthorized population — are ""significantly lower"" than incarceration rates of native-born young men without a high-school diploma. Specifically for Mexican men ages 18 to 39, the incarceration rate in 2010 was 2.8 percent, compared to 10.7 percent for native-born men in the same age group, the council’s report said. Immigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report’s authors. ""They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police,"" he said in an email interview. ""This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence."" And even as the immigrant population increases, crime has gone down, the report said. Between 1990 and 2013, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population increased from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent, and the number of unauthorized immigrants went up from 3.5 million to 11.2 million. At the same time, violent crime rate (murder, rape and aggravated assault) decreased 48 percent and property crime rate fell 41 percent, the report said, citing FBI data. Bianca E. Bersani, an assistant professor and director of the Criminology and Criminal Justice Program at the University of Massachusetts Boston, says her research also shows that crime involvement among foreign-born residents is lower than that of U.S.-born citizens. It holds true for Mexican immigrants, she said. ""When ethnicity can be distinguished and Mexican immigrants isolated from the group of first-generation immigrants, research continues to find that Mexican immigrants have lower rates of involvement in crime compared to their U.S-born peers,"" Bersani said. Recent studies tracking changes over time also found that areas of the country with an increased foreign-born population do not experience corresponding increases in crime, said Bersani. ""The rhetoric of the ‘criminal immigrant’ does not align with the bulk of empirical research,"" Bersani said. According to Bersani’s research, while first-generation immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population, the second generation (individuals born in the United States to at least one foreign-born parent) more closely resemble patterns of their native-born peers (three or more U.S.-born generations). ""This does not suggest that the second generation is uniquely crime prone, but instead that they are acting in ways that are no different from the rest of the U.S.-born population,"" Bersani said. Datasets with information on both crime and immigrant status are rare, Bersani said, though more research and data are becoming available. The Center for Immigration Studies, which supports stricter immigration policies, in a 2009 study said that overall understanding of immigrants and crime ""remains confused"" due to lack of data and contrary information. Unless inmates are identified as immigrant or native-born, incarceration rates are a poor way to measure links between immigrants and crime, the study said. Deportations of criminal immigrants may also decrease immigrant incarceration rates because many will not return to the United States and commit more crimes, as could be the case with native-born criminals, the CIS report said. There isn’t exact data on how many undocumented immigrants are currently incarcerated. Our ruling Johnson said Mexican immigrants are not ""murderers and rapists"" but are actually ""more law-abiding than U.S. citizens and that is a statistic."" Numerous studies by scholars and partisan groups show that the foreign-born population is less likely to commit crimes than the native-born, and experts say this includes Mexican immigrants. Researchers agree more data is needed to get a better understanding of immigration and crime, but the information available does not disprove Johnson’s point. We rate Johnson’s statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/67eae50a-55c4-485e-bd36-697619caa1a5",/factchecks/2016/jul/14/gary-johnson/mexican-immigrants-more-law-abiding/
"['Immigration', 'Health Care', 'Illinois', 'Bill Mitchell']","
Did Illinois spend hundreds of millions of dollars giving health insurance to illegal immigrants?
","Illinois state Rep. Bill Mitchell, R-Forsyth, repeatedly slammed a three-year extension of the state’s Expanded All Kids program that was passed in the Illinois House in April. While arguing against the bill, Mitchell claimed that All Kids has spent a fortune on covering illegal immigrants with taxpayer dollars. ""The latest (All Kids) audit said, over the last six years, the state of Illinois spent about $320 million on illegal immigrants,"" he said in April. All Kids is a health insurance program run by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services that offers comprehensive health care to thousands of children in the state. Expanded All Kids is the portion of the program that covers poor families and undocumented children. As of the 2013-14 fiscal year, the program had a total enrollment of 52,075 children under the age of 19, of which 30,441 were classified as undocumented. All Kids has faced criticism over the years for its coverage of undocumented immigrants as well as for allegedly being more expensive and providing less coverage than originally anticipated. We decided to investigate Mitchell’s claim about health care spending on undocumented immigrants. Looking at the numbers  Source: IL House GOP Mitchell’s claim is based on several audits of All Kids conducted by William Holland, the Illinois auditor general at the time. The latest available report was released in February 2016 and covers health care costs up until 2014; there is no data available for fiscal year 2015. Mitchell’s office told PolitiFact that his comment was referring to the amount of money spent between 2009 and 2014. A press release provided by the office stated that, ""none of these costs were matched by the federal government. Illinois taxpayers paid the entire cost for these non-citizens."" We examined the audit reports to break down the costs of health care associated with undocumented children in Illinois each year. FY 2009: $54.9 million FY 2010: $59.2 million FY 2011: $58.8 million FY 2012: $55.7 million FY 2013: $48.7 million FY 2014: $42.3 million The total costs of health care during the time period add up to approximately $319.6 million, which matches Mitchell’s claim. The audit reports also list the costs of services by each category. For example, in the 2013-14 fiscal year, dental services cost $12 million, or around 17 percent of that year’s total costs. We reached out to the Auditor General’s office and to All Kids for information on how much was spent on undocumented children for each category of health care. We’ll add this information if we obtain it. The All Kids program confirmed the accuracy of the figures in an email, but did not offer comments on Mitchell’s claim. How do the yearly costs of health care for undocumented children fit into the overall state budget? The 2014 Illinois budget was $67 billion. The General Revenue Fund, the part of the budget that contains discretionary spending, was approximately $31 billion. The amount of money spent on undocumented children through the Expanded All Kids program translates to roughly .136 percent of discretionary spending for that year. Are there hidden benefits to the program? One question worth exploring is if granting health insurance to undocumented children carries any hidden economic benefits that Rep. Mitchell didn’t account for in his claim. The health care and immigration experts we interviewed said that health care programs often partly pay for themselves over long periods of time. First, the children receive direct benefits from being covered, such as decreased mortality and a higher chance of attending college. Additionally, the state may receive long-term economic benefits. A recent preliminary study concluded that, ""the government will recoup 56 cents of each dollar spent on childhood Medicaid by the time these children reach age 60."" However, this study was conducted on the federal level, and doesn’t specifically examine undocumented children. Matt Notowidigdo, associate professor of economics at Northwestern University, told us that hospitals in Illinois often already cover the uninsured without receiving compensation, and may actually benefit from Expanded All Kids. ""If undocumented immigrants already consume a lot of health care in our hospitals but often don't pay for that care, then one can view this program as helping out hospitals financially,"" he said in an email. It’s hard to use this research to judge Mitchell’s claim because of how specific and small the Expanded All Kids program is. We found no research directly discussing any economic benefits that Illinois would receive from the program. Our ruling Mitchell claimed that the state of Illinois spent $320 million on health care for illegal immigrants over the past six years. The state’s independent audit reports on the All Kids program from 2009 to 2014 support his claim. There’s no direct evidence or research that shows Mitchell failed to mention any important unseen benefits of the program that would significantly change the context of his argument. We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2016/jul/14/bill-mitchell/illinois-spent-millions-covering-illegals/
"['Health Care', 'Veterans', 'Virginia', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump says average of 20 veterans commit suicide daily
","Topping Donald Trump’s 10-point plan to help U.S. military veterans is a pledge to improve their mental health services. ""A shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans,"" the presumptive GOP presidential nominee said during a July 11 speech in Virginia Beach, where he excoriated the Department of Veterans Affairs and laid out reforms. We wondered whether Trump’s sad suicide number is correct. His campaign pointed us to research the VA released on July 7 in advance of the agency’s planned publication this month of its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides. The VA examined about 55 million veterans records from 1979 through 2014. It found that in 2014, the latest year for which figures are available, that 7,403 veterans took their own lives, or an average of about 20 veterans a day. The count updates a much-cited VA estimate that an average of 22 veterans killed themselves each day in 2010. The VA always acknowledged that this old study was limited, because it was based on veterans living in only 21 states. Notably absent were California and Texas - two states with very high veteran populations. The new figure of 20 veteran suicides a day is based on records from every state. The VA said that 65 percent of veterans who took their own lives in 2014 were 50 or older, a finding that jibes with Trump’s statement that the daily suicides especially pertained to ""older veterans."" For context, it should be noted that 75 percent of the nation’s veterans are 50 or older. On the other hand, the VA found that younger veterans had the highest rate of suicides. Those ages 18 to 29 had a suicide rate of 77 per 100,000 in 2014. Veterans ages 50 to 59, by comparison, had a rate of 39 per 100,000. In all age groups, the VA found that the percentage of veterans who take their lives was substantially higher than that of adults who never served in the military. The rate for non-veterans ages 18 to 29, for example, was 12.8 per 100,000. The rate for non-vets ages 50 to 59 was 18.6 per 100,000. The 2014 suicide rate for all veterans was 35.3 per 100,000; the rate for all adult non-vets was 15.2 per 100,000. After adjusting for differences in age and gender, the VA concluded that veterans have a 21 percent higher risk of suicide than non-serving adults. Is the situation improving? During a July 7 news conference, VA officials were asked whether their research shows that there has been improvement in the veteran suicide problem, since the updated number, 20 deaths a day, was lower than the previous estimate of 22. David Shulkin, the VA’s undersecretary for health, said the department doesn’t view the new number as a sign of progress. Shulkin said the average number of daily suicides may decreasing because the aging population of veterans also is waning. He stressed, however, that the suicide rate for veterans was rising. VA figures show that the veterans suicide rate actually has increased 32 percent since 2001. That compares with a 23 percent increase in the rate for non-vets during the same period. According to the new report, the suicide rate among veterans who used VA services increased 8.8 percent since 2001, while the rate among veterans who didn’t use those services increased 38.6 percent. Critics have said focusing on the daily number of veteran suicides is pointless and that attention should be fixed on examining the veteran suicide rate and how it compares with the rest of the country. Shulkin, during the news conference, said the daily suicide rate figure has become so ""ingrained"" in public conversation that the VA decided to recalculate it to ensure it’s correct. Our ruling Trump said, ""A shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans."" His claim is supported by recent research by the VA and we rate the statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5c79ae1-2a18-49c8-a325-8e1146fc012e",/factchecks/2016/jul/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-correctly-says-20-veterans-commit-sui/

Snapchat highlights decades old data as part of Michelle Obama visit to Morocco
","Factual claims are apparently now like Pokémon. They can be anywhere. We stumbled across an interesting factoid recently while flipping through a Snapchat story documenting First Lady Michelle Obama’s visit to West Africa and Morocco from June 27 to July 1. Obama just joined Snapchat, if you’re interested. Snapchats disappear, but we were able to grab a screengrab with a sobering claim about illiteracy rates among women in Morocco. The snap had the headline ""Moroccan illiteracy"" and said that ""90% of rural women and 55% of all women are illiterate."" Is that true? Or should this claim disappear right along with your Snapchat? We wanted to find out. Tracking the claim to its source The journey of this claim is particularly interesting, and shows the perils of how incorrect or outdated statistics can be repeated over and over. The snap cites as its source a blog post by Vital Voices, a non-profit that advances women’s causes around the globe. That actually is a reposting of an article from the IntLawGrrls website, a blog dedicated to discussion of international law and policy. The original IntLawGrrls post is from September 2011 and was written by Christie Edwards, the current director of international humanitarian law at the American Red Cross. Edwards claimed in her piece that ""recent surveys in Morocco estimated the country’s illiteracy rate to be approximately 55 percent of all women. Fully 90 percent of rural women in Morocco are illiterate."" Edwards’ blog cites a UNICEF table of statistics. But that table doesn’t correspond to her figures. The UNICEF table only lists an overall literacy rate of 74 percent for women 15-24 in Morocco (or an illiteracy rate of 26 percent). It makes no mention of illiteracy rates for a wider age range of women or for rural women specifically. So we asked Edwards where she got her data from. A spokeswoman told us the statistic actually comes from a 2004 USAID report on education in the Muslim world. That report includes, without citation, the following passage: ""Literacy levels remain very low: 63 percent for men and 38 percent for women. Illiteracy is a particular problem for women in rural areas, where nine out of 10 women are illiterate."" The claim that nine out of 10 rural Moroccan women are illiterate goes back even further, to a 1996 USAID resource request report that claims, ""Women remain especially disadvantaged by low literacy (13% of rural women are literate)."" So to recap, a 2016 Snapchat relies on a crosspost of a 2011 blog that erroneously cites UNICEF data when in fact it’s coming from a 2004 USAID report that is using a 1996 USAID resource request as is its foundation. If that sounds fishy, it is. Illiteracy in Morocco To find out the current illiteracy rate among Moroccan women, we examined public records maintained by UNESCO’s Institute for Statistics. The website’s profile on Morocco lists a literacy rate of around 62.05 percent for women aged 15 years and older in 2015, which translates to an illiteracy rate of 37.95 percent. (Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check listed a different percentage.) The database doesn’t give specific information about illiteracy for rural versus urban women. Leonardo Menchini, the head of the social inclusion section at UNICEF Morocco, shared the most recent data on illiteracy rates for urban and rural populations with PolitiFact. UNICEF’s data come from the 2014 Moroccan census.  The takeaway: illiteracy remains an issue for females in Morocco, but not near the levels seen in the Snapchat. Our ruling A Snapchat story featuring First Lady Michelle Obama claimed that, in Morocco, ""90% of rural women and 55% of all women are illiterate."" That data is, in some cases, at least 20 years old -- way older than Snapchat. The claim cites old data from a report in 2004, that tracks back to a 1996 USAID request report. The most recent information from UNESCO and UNICEF indicate that Morocco’s illiteracy among women is still relatively high (60 percent in rural areas and 42 percent overall), but much lower than what the snap says. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/452873e9-e53d-4ae9-9483-c9f7c3576d83",/factchecks/2016/jul/14/snapchat/snapchat-highlights-decades-old-data-part-michelle/

Bennet campaign says GOP Senate candidate Darryl Glenn wants to see Ted Cruz on Supreme Court
","For months Democratic U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado has run upbeat ads while more than a dozen Republican candidates slugged it out to become their party’s Senate nominee. But now that El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn has emerged as the victor in the Republican primary, the Bennet team has branded him as the candidate of ""the fringe of the Republican Party"" who is ""too extreme for Colorado."" In a recent fundraising email, the Bennet team ticked off things Glenn has said as proof that he’s ""ultra-conservative."" It included him saying on a conservative talk radio show, ""I for one want to see (Ted) Cruz as a Supreme Court appointee."" Yet, it appears unlikely that Glenn would view his passionate support of Cruz -- the Texas senator who lost his bid for the GOP presidential nomination -- as a negative. ""I am an unapologetic Christian, constitutional conservative, pro-life, Second Amendment-loving American!"" Glenn declared in a fiery speech that ignited the Colorado Republican Convention in April. The county commissioner, who had been struggling to raise campaign funding, swept up 70 percent of the convention vote and was the only GOP Senate candidate to win election to the ballot. (Others had to hire signature gatherers to petition their way onto the ballot). Soon Glenn was drawing endorsements from conservative standard bearers like Cruz and former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin and receiving crucial funding from the Senate Conservatives Fund. Just days before the state primary last month, Cruz came to Colorado and publicly endorsed Glenn, who told the crowd at the Westin Denver International Airport that if Cruz didn’t somehow wrestle the presidential nomination from Donald Trump, then Glenn had another job in mind for the Texas firebrand. ""If he cannot be our next president of the United States of America, I am personally going to lead the charge to make sure he’s our next Supreme Court justice,"" Glenn said, stirring the crowd to give Cruz a standing ovation, according to the Denver Post. Later, in a backroom, Glenn reinforced the idea, telling Cruz, ""I’m very serious about the Supreme Court, if that (presidential nomination) doesn't happen,"" the Post reported. Glenn made the Cruz-for-the-high court comment that the Bennet campaign quoted in its June 17 email on conservative commentator Mark Levin’s nationally syndicated talk show. (Here's a recording of the interview. Glenn makes the comment at 5:05 on the recording). ""I am very serious about winning this race. We need to send a clear message, because what I want, I want an overwhelming victory so I can go to Washington, D.C., with a mandate, and send some reinforcements to Mr. Cruz. And I for one want to see Mr. Cruz as a Supreme Court appointee,"" Glenn said on the show. PolitiFact has asked the Glenn campaign for comment and hasn't received a reply as of publication. We’ll update the story if they respond. Our ruling In a fundraising email, the Michael Bennet campaign quoted Darryl Glenn saying, ""I for one want to see Cruz as a Supreme Court appointee.""

Hillary Clinton says that, according to analysts, Donald Trump would increase debt by $30 trillion
","Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have found common ground criticizing Donald Trump’s policy agenda, with Sanders formally endorsing Clinton as the Democratic nominee for president at a rally in New Hampshire. ""Compare what Sen. Sanders and I intend to do with Donald Trump's plan,"" Clinton said. ""His tax plan would make our current system even worse. Independent analysts say he would add $30 trillion to the national debt in order to give a massive gift to the wealthiest Americans, Wall Street money managers and our largest corporations. But after all, what else should we expect from someone who calls himself ‘The King of Debt?’ "" We wondered whether Clinton was right that ""independent analysts say (Donald Trump) would add $30 trillion to the national debt."" As we have previously noted, the figure originated in a report from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that, among other things, regularly analyzes the broader economic effects of presidential candidates’ tax proposals. In its report, the center found that ""including interest costs, the proposal would add $11.2 trillion to the national debt by 2026 and $34.1 trillion by 2036."" This estimate assumes no major spending cuts would be made, which tracks with the historical pattern, the authors said. The Clinton campaign also noted that Trump has never specified any cuts to offset his plan. So Clinton has a point that the $30 trillion-plus figure has been used by an independent organization. Still, it’s worth noting a couple caveats. • That analysis uses a 20-year time frame. When groups like the Tax Policy Center analyze the budgetary impact of policy proposals, they typically use a fixed ""window"" of time to measure the effects. Usually, it’s a 10-year window. In this case, the center offered both a 10-year window and a somewhat more unconventional 20-year window. Over 10 years, the center projected, Trump’s policies would increase the debt by $11.2 trillion. Over 20 years, they would increase the debt by $34.1 trillion. So Clinton cherry-picked the bigger one for her talking point -- a figure that was three times as big, and which used an unconventional window of time. Regardless of the time frame she used, failing to indicate a time period for the figure is somewhat misleading, said Roberton Williams, a Tax Policy Center fellow. • Clinton overlooked a study with a smaller projected debt increase. Another study of Trump’s policies, by the economic forecasting firm Moody’s, offered three scenarios, depending on whether one takes Trump’s policy proposals at face value, whether he enacts them with some compromises, or whether he ends up unable to enact much of his agenda. All the scenarios look at the impact of the resulting policies over 10 years. The first scenario produces additional debt of $9.7 trillion above current policies. The second produces a debt increase of $6.9 trillion above current policies. And the last produces a debt increase of less than $1 trillion above current policies. That final scenario is about 3 percent of the amount Clinton cited in the speech. Our ruling Clinton said that ""independent analysts say (Donald Trump) would add $30 trillion to the national debt."" The number does come from an independent, nonpartisan report. But Clinton didn’t cite the 20-year time frame for her statement, an important omission. And, she ignored smaller (though still substantial) projected increases from independent analysts. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate the statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8a31cb99-354b-40e1-a2c7-4eae5158d98b",/factchecks/2016/jul/13/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-according-analysts-donald-tru/

""The statistics don't lie about the excessive numbers of stops,"" said Jones, who is black. ""Let's not talk about traffic stops. Let's take something tough like drugs. African-Americans don't use drugs (at a) higher level than whites. (It's) about the same percentage; about 12 percent. But we wind up getting arrested, not 50 percent more. We wind up going to prison six times more because there seems to be some institutional bias. Doesn't that bother you?"" Houck's response: ""That doesn't show any institutional bias."" We were interested in Jones' statement that blacks don't use drugs at a higher level than whites, yet they the wind up going to prison six times more often. We fact-checked a similar statement in February 2016, when presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton declared that ""African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do."" We rated that statement True. But Jones' comment was less generic, dealing specifically with drugs. When we contacted him, he said he was going away for a while and couldn't remember the source off the top of his head. So we went looking for information. Jones may have been referring to data contained in the 2014 National Research Council report on ""Growth of Incarceration in the United States: Exploring Causes and Consequences."" Pages 60 and 61 focus on drug crimes. We'll talk about drug use first. The report says, ""The prevalence of drug use is only slightly higher among blacks than whites for some illicit drugs and slightly lower for others; the difference is not substantial. There is also little evidence, when all drug types are considered, that blacks sell drugs more often than whites."" We checked the overall data from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Here's the breakdown for all illicit drugs.  There are racial differences in the types of drugs being abused, according to surveys by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Blacks, for example, are far less likely to have used marijuana, cocaine and hallucinogens in their lifetime than whites, but — at least in the case of marijuana — whites are more likely to give it up over time. With that backdrop, the National Research Council report says, ""In recent years, drug-related arrest rates for blacks have been three to four times higher than those for whites. In the late 1980s, the rates were six times higher for blacks than for whites."" Here's the drug arrest rate trend:  But Jones was talking about the rates of imprisonment for drug crimes, not arrest rates. Those numbers turned out to be harder to find. We turned to Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst for The Sentencing Project, an advocacy group in Washington. She pointed us to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics reporting on the number of people going to state prison for drug offenses and numbers from the United States Sentencing Commission on the racial makeup of drug offenders going to federal prison. Those numbers aren't perfect for our comparison. For example, the state prison data only lists inmates based on their most serious offense, so someone convicted of a drug crime may not be listed in that category if that person was given a longer sentence for assault. Adjusting for the number of blacks and whites (another approximation because many Americans are of mixed race), the black imprisonment rate for drug offenses is about 5.8 times higher than it is for whites. That's very close to what Jones said. It should be noted that these numbers vary from source to source. The NAACP's Criminal Justice Fact Sheet asserts that ""five times as many whites are using drugs as African Americans, yet African Americans are sent to prison for drug offenses at 10 times the rate of whites."" It doesn't list a source. Spokeswoman Raquel Coombs said the ratios may be out of date. We noted in the BJS data that the racial disparity has decreased significantly since 1991. That NAACP 10 percent imprisonment statistic appears to be based on 2003 data analyzed in 2009 by Human Rights Watch. (We also note that the drug-use statistic is easy to misread. Whites aren't five times more likely to use drugs. Five times more whites are using drugs because there are about 5.5 times more whites in the U.S. population than blacks.) We wondered why so many more blacks are going to prison for drug offenses. They're more likely to get caught selling drugs, as Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota, told us back in February. ""Whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors. Blacks sell to people they don't know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest."" Blacks arrested for drugs are more likely to be sent to jail because they're more likely to have had a previous run-in with the law. Police tend to patrol high-crime areas more aggressively, which tend to be the poor areas, which have a higher proportion of minorities. Thus, they're more likely to be stopped for something and have a rap sheet once a drug charge comes along. As we found in our previous fact-check, their sentences also tend to be longer. Our ruling Jones said that African-Americans don't use drugs at a higher level than whites but wind up going to prison six times more. African-Americans use drugs at roughly the same levels as white Americans, although overall illicit drug use among blacks has been marginally higher than for whites, with some differences in the types of drugs used, according to a national surveys. Jones' bigger point was about the disparity in sentencing, and the rate of African-Americans' incarceration for drug offenses is very close to what Jones said. We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/jul/13/van-jones/van-jones-claim-drug-use-imprisonment-rates-blacks/
"['Immigration', 'New York', 'Bill de Blasio']","
Fewer immigrants affected by Supreme Court ruling in NYC than De Blasio thinks
","After the U.S. Supreme Court struck down parts of President Barack Obama’s 2014 executive actions on immigration reform, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio held an impromptu press conference at New York City Hall. During his remarks, he offered an estimate of the number of unauthorized immigrants in New York City who would be affected by the court’s ruling. ""Two hundred twenty-thousand New Yorkers would have immediately benefitted had President Obama’s executive action been affirmed,"" De Blasio said. ""So almost a quarter million of our fellow New Yorkers who are hurting right now whose rights and opportunities were taken away by the Supreme Court."" De Blasio claimed that the Supreme Court’s ruling would damage the lives of 220,000 people in New York City. So did the Supreme Court ruling mean that many people lost their chance to legally remain in the country? DAPA and DACA Checking the accuracy of the mayor’s assertion requires accounting for the number of people affected by three actions by the Obama administration. First, the administration started the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, in 2012. DACA allows people who came to the United States before their 16th birthday to legally remain in the country for at least two years. After the two years, they can apply for renewal. To qualify for the program, immigrants could not be older than 31 in 2012. Immigrants also had to have a relatively clean criminal record and be on track to finish high school or already graduated. The Migration Policy Institute estimated 53,000 people in New York City eligible to legally remain in the country under the 2012 DACA program, slightly more than an estimate of  48,935 by the Center for Migration Studies Second, in 2014, Obama expanded the DACA program. The age limit was lifted under the expansion. Some 15,701 people were eligible for the 2014 DACA extension, according to the Center for Migration Studies. Third, Obama also created the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, or DAPA, in 2014. The new program allowed parents of U.S. citizens to legally stay in the country for at least three years, after which they would be eligible for renewal. The center said its research shows an estimated 143,064 immigrants eligible for DAPA in New York City. According to the Migration Policy Institute, there are 627,000 unauthorized immigrants living in the five counties that make up New York City. Of those, 230,000 would have been eligible to legally remain in the country under either DAPA or DACA following the president’s 2014 actions, according to the institute. In 2014, many Republicans criticized DACA but weren’t able to reverse Obama’s action. But the expansion of DACA and creation of DAPA led to a legal storm between the state of Texas and the Obama administration. Texas argued that the president’s 2014 actions violated the Constitution. The Supreme Court sided with Texas. The decision struck down DAPA and the 2014 DACA expansion but left the original DACA program in place. So how many would be affected in New York City? When counting the number of people affected by the Supreme Court ruling, those eligible to legally remain in the country only because of the DAPA program or the 2014 expansion of DACA should be counted. That comes to just under 160,000 affected people, according to the Center for Migration Studies. The Migration Policy Institute pegs it slightly higher at 180,000 immigrants. Those who were eligible for the original 2012 DACA program are still eligible to apply and be granted deferred action despite the court ruling. A few groups track the number of people who were eligible under the 2014 actions, including the Migration Policy Institute. It is one of the few that have data available specifically for counties with high populations of unauthorized immigrants. That’s important because Mayor de Blasio was only referring to numbers in New York City. Its data is the latest from the U.S. Census Bureau. The mayor’s office says it also used data from the bureau to come up with its number. The bureau does not directly ask people if they are authorized to live in the U.S. legally. Michelle Mittelstadt from the Migration Policy Institute says the institute considers the population and demographics of an area to come up with a final number, and it’s among the few that does so on a local level. ""The Census Bureau does not ask people their legal status with respect to being unauthorized,"" Mittelstadt said. ""That leaves it to a small number of organizations who have developed methodology to essentially try to look at who among the foreign-born population is unauthorized."" Our ruling At a press conference on June 23, Mayor de Blasio said, ""Two hundred twenty thousand New Yorkers would have immediately benefitted had President Obama’s executive action been affirmed. So almost a quarter million of our fellow New Yorkers who are hurting right now whose rights and opportunities were taken away by the Supreme Court."" Based on the latest data, released in 2014, the mayor overestimated the number of unauthorized immigrants the Supreme Court ruling affected. His office says the city’s Center for Economic Opportunity used its own methodology in conjunction with data from the Census Bureau to develop its estimate, but a 40,000-person difference reaches beyond a margin of error. We rate this claim as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/jul/13/bill-de-blasio/less-immigrants-affects-supreme-court-ruling-nyc-d/
"['Economy', 'State Budget', 'Stimulus', 'Taxes', 'Pennsylvania', 'Mike Turzai']","
Surprising PA budget claim from GOP leader almost checks out
","State House Speaker Mike Turzai criticized Governor Tom Wolf’s stance on budget talks in a PennLive op-ed last month. As Turzai sees it, Wolf wants more taxes. But to balance the state’s books, he argues, it doesn’t have to be that way. ""Under former Gov. Tom Corbett, we made some tough decisions. But in the face of a sputtering economy, we delivered four on-time, balanced budgets without increasing broad-based taxes,"" wrote Turzai. ""Each budget finished in the black"" With reports of deficits creeping past $2 billion when Wolf entered office, and the gloomy measure of the state’s finances referenced frequently during last year’s nine-month budget impasse, it may seem confusing to read that each Corbett year ended so well. We decided to look into the numbers for a clearer sense. So, a structural deficit occurs when expenditures are set to outpace revenue. Budget experts refer to this for deficits that appear within the fiscal year at hand, but also for projections for the fiscal years to come. Corbett did indeed end each fiscal year with a positive general fund balance. ""That result must occur because the Governor is required to certify that the budget for the fiscal year that ends is in balance before agreement can be reached on the new fiscal year,"" Matthew Knittel, director of the Independent Fiscal Office,  a nonpartisan state center for budget analysis, explained in an email. Mark Price, research director at the left-leaning Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, called Turzai’s recollection accurate ""on it’s face."" But he cautioned, ""It’s not a full accounting of the implications of those choices."" Nathan Benefield, vice president of policy at the Commonwealth Foundation, a conservative think tank also thought the statement bore truth, but noted that that matter was ""nuance[d]."" ""It depends on what ‘in the black’ actually means,"" he wrote in a statement. ""Three out of the four Corbett budgets spent more than net revenue."" But how can this be? Corbett has been largely blamed for the more than $1 billion in education cuts in 2011. His camp and Republicans in-state have long argued that pointing the finger at him is unfair. His predecessor, Ed Rendell, moved $1.3 billion in one-time federal stimulus funds towards schools after a study found the state’s system to be underfunded by $4.4 billion. ""I don’t see, from what we’ve seen so far, how you’re not going to leave the next governor with a disaster on their hands,"" said Centre County Senator Jake Corman reacted in March 2009, according to Philadelphia City Paper. The Corbett administration early on told constituents that financial management would be different under their watch. ""All of these events and fiscal realities conspire to make the 2011-12 budget the year we get our fiscal house in order,"" Charles Zogby, budget secretary at the time, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review roughly two months into Corbett’s term. ""No more reliance on federal stimulus funds, no more gimmicks, no more use of one-time funds. We're focused on the core missions of government and making difficult decisions to live within [our] means."" That budget would up the state’s contribution to education funding overall, as Team Corbett has reminded reporters plenty since, but did not nearly replace the federal money that had expired. The nearly $900 million shortfall in K-12 funding sent shockwaves through public education, and spawned, in many cases, crises, through school districts across the state. Price pointed out that the state may not have raised ""broad-based taxes,"" cash-strapped school districts upped property taxes. More than six in 10 school districts have increased them for the last six years straight. While Turzai can note that they achieved Corbett’s goal and didn’t raise taxes, local jurisdictions absolutely did. But even with these cuts, the Corbett administration didn’t fix the state’s deficit in his four years. Actually, in 2014, while other states’ general funds swelled, Pennsylvania found itself in the red. His administration argued that they’d inherited a deficit margin of $4 billion; Rendell staunchly denied this, stating that Corbett walked into a surplus. (The Independent Fiscal Office notes that the surplus in 2011 was $1.1 billion.) On the more liberal side, experts and politicians argued that corporate tax cuts had diminished revenue and aggravated an already dire situation. In 2014, revenue came in $509 million lower than estimated, according to the Independent Fiscal Office. ""[T]here are many methods that can and have been used to bring historical budgets into balance, such as one-time federal fund transfers, transfers from non-General Fund accounts and spending delays,"" Knittel told PolitiFact PA in an email. A late 2014 report from Knittel’s office lists a total $1.5 billion in transfers, payment delays and other ""nonrecurring"" deals ""used to balance and enact the FY 2014-15 budget."" In other words, Corbett was another governor who solved budget deficits with short-term maneuvers, but failed to fix the looming structural deficit that continues to hang over the state. The report did not celebrate these transfers: ""Those measures must be replaced by other one-time measures, permanent funds or expenditure reductions. The reliance on fund balances and nonrecurring measures has allowed policymakers to defer solutions to the long-term structural imbalance identified by this analysis.""   Our ruling Turzai wrote, ""Each budget finished in the black"" from the Corbett administration. This is right, but borderline misleading. It conveys that the state was healthy place financially. Pennsylvania wasn’t. Moreover, the administration implemented one-time tactics to balance the books that their own budget secretary had previously decried.

"['Income', 'Illinois', 'Bruce Rauner']","
Gov. Bruce Rauner says Illinois family incomes lower today than 17 years ago
","If you were to boil down the guiding theme of Bruce Rauner’s governorship, it would be: ""For 12 years, Illinois Democrats and the unions to whom they are beholden ran the state economy into the ground and now they refuse to help me fix it."" Rauner, Illinois’ first Republican governor since 2003, has been sharply critical of Illinois’ declining business and job climate under Democratic leadership from 2003 to 2015. His insistence that he will not engage in budget negotiations until Democrats pass business and government reforms led to a historic impasse that has left the state with no budget -- and a fast-growing pile of debt -- since June 30, 2015. To back his case for business-friendly reforms, Rauner frequently cites figures intended to demonstrate the toll Democratic policies have exacted on the state economy. Such was the case June 1, when Rauner appeared with local Republican lawmakers and school officials at the administrative offices of Community Unit School District 3 in Mahomet. Rauner’s visit came a day after, for the second straight year, the Democrat-controlled General Assembly adjourned without passing either Rauner’s various reforms or a state budget. ""We’ve had massive out-migration of people and jobs. We have the highest unemployment rate of any state in America,"" Rauner said, detailing a litany of Illinois’ problems on the business and government front. ""We have the highest level of corruption and cronyism and patronage of any state in America. We have lower family incomes in Illinois today than we had 17 years ago in Illinois. We are fundamentally in decline because of the control of (House) Speaker (Michael) Madigan and his Democrats."" Rauner made several claims here, but we’re going to focus on the part about family incomes. Is it true that Illinois has lower family incomes today than in 1999? According to his office, Rauner based his claim on U.S. Census Bureau data (click here and scroll to Table H-8) for median household income from 1984 to 2014. The 2015 figure won’t be out until September, so Rauner’s ""last 17 years"" really means from 1999 to 2014. The top chart below shows average annual household incomes for Illinois and Indiana in the period mentioned by Rauner. The lower chart shows Illinois and its neighboring states.   Indeed, the 2014 median household income in Illinois was $54,916 and the 1999 median household income, adjusted for inflation, was $65,850. That’s a decline of 16.6 percent. Pretty bad, right? But look at neighboring Indiana, which saw its median household income plummet 17.2 percent -- to the current $48,060 -- in the same time period. Or Wisconsin, which had a 10.5 percent drop. Missouri went from $58,819 in 1999 to $56,630 in 2014 -- a 3.7 percent decline. Nationwide, the inflation-adjusted median income went from $57,843 in 1999 to $53,657 in 2014. That’s a drop of 7.2 percent.  So there’s no disputing that Illinois’ median household income fell between 1999 and 2014, but Rauner presented the figure as if Illinois were an outlier among other states; that its political leadership had chartered a uniquely disastrous course. A look at the same time period for Indiana -- a state repeatedly cited by Rauner as a beacon of economic growth -- shows Illinois was far from alone. In fact, only four states in the nation -- Maryland, Montana, North Dakota and Oregon -- had higher median household incomes in 2014 than at some other point in the Census Bureau's 30-year survey. (Only North Dakota had a Republican governor in 2014.) And 1999 is no ordinary year for Illinois in this set of numbers. It’s the year with the highest median household income in the 30 years covered. Had Rauner gone for a 25-year comparison and used 1991’s median household income, he would have found an increase of 1.5 percent ($54,068 in 1991 and $54,916 in 2014). Pinpointing whether and to what extent state government policy influenced an economic trend like median household income is difficult, says Darren H. Lubotsky, a professor in the economics department at the University of Illinois-Chicago and a member of the university’s Institute of Government and Public Affairs. A state’s industrial base is the greatest indicator of how it will reflect or resist an economic downturn like those that hit the national economy after 9/11 and in the Great Recession, Lubotsky says. ""Is it accurate to blame state government leadership? Maybe. Is it the unfunded pension liability? The quality of schools? Crime? The so-called culture of corruption? Maybe they all play a role or maybe only some do. I am not sure one could credibly point to what policies really matter,"" Lubotsky says. Our ruling ""We have lower family incomes in Illinois today than we had 17 years ago."" Rauner is stretching the time frame when he says income is lower ""today"" than it was 17 years ago. The Census Bureau won’t even have 2015 figures for three more months. But the bigger problem here is that by choosing the peak income year among 30 years’ worth of data and presenting Illinois as an isolated case, Rauner tacitly asserts that Illinois is unique in seeing lower income ""today"" than in 1999.
