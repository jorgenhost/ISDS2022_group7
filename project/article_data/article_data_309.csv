Obama disagreed, but didn't criticize
","
In the third, final and most combative debate, Sen. John McCain accused Sen. Barack Obama of failing to repudiate nasty statements against McCain involving racial politics.
 
“Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace. That, to me, was so hurtful,” McCain said during the Hofstra University debate on Oct. 15, 2008.
 
“And, Senator Obama, you didn’t repudiate those remarks.”
 
McCain referred to comments by Rep. Lewis, D-Georgia, who is an icon in the civil rights movement. In a statement Oct. 11, 2008, Lewis related the tenor of McCain campaign events to political tactics by segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace that encouraged attacks over people seeking civil rights protections in the 1960s.
 
“What I am seeing reminds me too much of another destructive period in American history,” Lewis wrote. “Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin are sowing the seeds of hatred and division, and there is no need for this hostility in our political discourse.”
 
Lewis issued his statement after news reports catalogued a series of McCain campaign events in which some audience members shouted such things as “terrorist” and “kill him” when Obama’s name was mentioned by the speakers. The remarks came as the McCain campaign embarked on a decidedly aggressive approach, focusing on Obama’s long-ago association with 1960s radical William Ayers.
 
But the question is whether Obama was silent when Lewis likened the tone of the McCain rallies to those of Wallace and the segregationists. Obama’s campaign did break with Lewis’ statement the same day he made it, although it also said Lewis “was right to condemn” statements by Palin associating Obama with terrorists.
 
Here’s the statement Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton issued on Oct. 11:
 
“Senator Obama does not believe that John McCain or his policy criticism is in any way comparable to George Wallace or his segregationist policies.  But John Lewis was right to condemn some of the hateful rhetoric that John McCain himself personally rebuked just last night, as well as the baseless and profoundly irresponsible charges from his own running mate that the Democratic nominee for President of the United States ‘pals around with terrorists.’
 
“As Barack Obama has said himself, the last thing we need from either party is the kind of angry, divisive rhetoric that tears us apart at a time of crisis when we desperately need to come together.  That is the kind of campaign Senator Obama will continue to run in the weeks ahead.”
 
But that statement never explicitly said Lewis was wrong — which is crucial to repudiating someone or something. Instead, Obama’s campaign said Lewis’ comparison wasn’t correct.
 
In the debate, Obama did say Lewis “inappropriately drew a comparison” between the civil rights trouble and McCain rallies.
 
Lewis later said he could have phrased his words differently, because he didn’t want to relate McCain and Palin directly to Wallace’s tactics. But he said he accomplished his goal of highlighting the dangerous tone of the rallies.
 
Obama’s campaign did promptly issue a statement, disputing the comparison that Lewis made. But that’s not the same as “repudiating” or admonishing Lewis for making that comparison. Because Obama’s campaign never specifically criticized Lewis, we rate McCain’s statement as True.

Small businesses are exempt
","
John McCain talked a lot about ""Joe the Plumber"" during the third presidential debate, saying Joe is an example of a small business owner who would not do well under Barack Obama's policies.
 
""Now, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there,"" McCain said. ""Now, Joe, Senator Obama's plan, if you're a small business ... if you don't adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you.""
 
McCain used this charge during the second debate as well. We found it False then, and it's still problematic now.
 
Here's the outline of Obama's plan: It expands health care coverage for those who don't have it by a number of strategies, such as creating national pools for individuals to buy their own insurance. It increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. And it aims at reining in costs for everyone by streamlining medical record-keeping and emphasizing preventive care. Obama's plan does not mandate coverage, except for children.
 
Obama's plan says that employers who don't offer their employees insurance will be required to contribute to the national pool, what McCain calls a ""fine."" But Obama's plan specifically exempts small businesses from contributing to the pool.
 
The plan does not define what's a small business and what's not. We can't say for sure whether plumber Joe would be considered a small business under Obama's plan or not.
 
But generally, Obama does not fine ""small businesses."" They are specifically exempt. We rate McCain's claim False.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Barack Obama']","
A major distortion on McCain's policy
","
In the final presidential debate, Barack Obama attacked John McCain's health care policy as a net loss for workers.
 
He was referring to a McCain proposal to repeal the traditional exemption on employer-provided insurance in exchange for a tax credit that will encourage workers to seek their own insurance. The credit would be $2,500 per person, or $5,000 for couples.
 
In the debate, Obama got some things right about McCain's policy. Critics of McCain's policy do indeed worry that it will discourage employers from offering health care without lowering premiums for everyone.
 
But Obama oversimplified drastically when he said, ""By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000. So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.""
 
To explain why this statement is problematic, let's get into more details about McCain's policy.
 
Most Americans who have health insurance, about 71 percent, get it through their employer. Usually, the premiums are split so that the employer pays part and the employee pays part. Typically, the employer pays at least half, and often more.
 
Strictly speaking, the part that the employer pays is considered compensation and workers would owe taxes on it if there wasn't a tax exemption in federal law. The exemption makes employer-provided health insurance more attractive to both workers and employers.
 
McCain wants to encourage greater competition for health insurance as a way to reduce premiums. His idea is that people should be able to go out on the open market and buy their own health insurance, and not be pushed into an employer-provided insurance plan by tax incentives.
 
So under McCain's plan, the tax exemption for employer-provided health insurance would disappear, and people would get a tax credit  to spend on any health insurance they wish. They might choose to use their employer's plan and use the tax credit to offset the new tax on the benefit, or they might go off and buy insurance on their own.
 
It's a complex switcheroo, but there's ample evidence to show that the plan would be a wash for most workers. Keep in mind the current benefit is not worth $12,000, which is the cost of the average family plan; the benefit is

the taxes

on the part of that $12,000 that the employer pays. So if the employer picks up $8,000 of a $12,000 policy, the current benefit is the

taxes a worker would pay

on $8,000.
 
The McCain campaign says only workers with ""gold-plated"" health programs would do worse with the new credit. An independent analysis from the nonpartisan Urban Institute confirms that: ""In general, lower-income people with health insurance would receive benefits from the credit that would be well in excess of the value that they receive from today’s tax exemption. The gains are much smaller for higher-income people.""
 
Obama's numbers are wrong. McCain's health plan does not replace a $12,000 policy with a $5,000 credit. It replaces

the taxes on part of that amount

with a tax credit. We rate Obama's statement False.

Beating a retreat on a lavish retreat
","
Trying to finger executives connected to the financial market meltdown to justify his calls for more corporate accountability, Sen. Barack Obama is keying on officials of the giant insurer American International Group Inc., whose high-risk investment portfolio imploded as a result of the mortgage crisis, prompting an $85 billion, taxpayer-funded bailout.

 

In stump speeches and during his second presidential debate with Sen. John McCain, Obama has trumpeted the fact that the company organized a $400,000 weeklong conference for brokers at a swanky California resort days after bailout, and planned a second such gathering.
 
""Did you hear about these AIG executives? Here we are, we give them some help to keep their business afloat and they take a junket for over $400,000? Twice. Come on, now. They should return to Washington. If I was president, I would order them back. And I want a check for the taxpayers and they would be fired on the spot,"" Obama said at an Oct. 9 campaign rally in Cincinnati.
 
Obama may be feeding big portions of red meat to Americans aggrieved by the dealings on Wall Street. But to put his claim in context, one has consider that AIG is a huge holding company with $1 trillion of assets that oversees distinct business units. The financial problems that triggered the bailout originated with a financial-products unit that guaranteed mortgage-backed securities and placed risky bets on the housing market. The Sept. 22-30 retreat at the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif. was organized months before the bailout by a separate AIG subsidiary that handles life insurance and that wasn't connected to the mortgage crisis.
 
The object of the gathering at the St. Regis  – where ocean-view rooms start at $565 per night – was to motivate and reward independent insurance brokers, who aren't AIG employees but sell the company's products. Such ""attaboy"" gatherings have been standard practice in the insurance business for many years, AIG Chief Executive Officer Edward Liddy asserted in an Oct. 8 letter to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. (Details of the conference were first reported by the

Orange County Register

on Oct. 2.)
 
 
 
The company, in an Oct. 8 statement addressing the affair, said only 10 of the more than 100 attendees were employees of the AIG insurance subsidiary, adding no executives from company headquarters were present.
 
It's worth noting that while the junket might seem inappropriately lavish given the current circumstances, AIG’s life and property and casualty insurance businesses are financially sound, and have sufficient assets to pay claims. The financial-products business, on the other hand, was enmeshed in Wall Street's speculative bubble and sold contracts to guarantee mortgage-backed securities held by institutional investors. The collapse of the housing market drove down the value of these contracts and put the company in a severe cash squeeze, because it was forced to put up billions of dollars in collateral. Under terms of the bailout, the Fed gave AIG an $85 billion loan in exchange for 80 percent of its assets, reasoning that had the struggling company collapsed, it would have unleashed a vicious domino effect and toppled banks and corporations around the world.
 
Obama is correct that the insurance brokers' gathering has hallmarks of a lavish junket. Records obtained from the St. Regis Resort by the House Oversight and Governmental Reform Committee, which is investigating AIG’s collapse, showed the insurer paid more than $147,000 for banquets, $23,000 for spa services and $6,900 for golf at the resort, located between Los Angeles and San Diego. Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman and others on the panel bitterly critizized the company for the trappings at a Oct. 7 hearing.
 
What’s more, the company planned a similar October gathering at the posh Ritz-Carlton in Half Moon Bay, Calif. but said on Oct. 9 it cancelled the gathering in the face of intensifying criticism from Obama, the Bush administration and members of Congress.
 
In the Oct. 8 letter to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. Liddy -- who replaced longtime AIG CEO Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg after the government loaned the money -- said his company faces new challenges and ""that we owe our employees and the American public new standards and approaches."" Liddy said AIG was ""reevaluating the costs of all aspects of our operations,"" in light of the turbulent market climate.
 
So Obama has found a legitimate example of corporate excess at a company that's become a symbol of the financial crisis. And it's true that all of the AIG business units ultimately report to a single CEO and have a direct bearing on the company's bottom line. However, the decision to pamper the life insurance brokers appears to have been made independent of the turmoil roiling the financial markets and was an accepted way of doing business in the life insurance field, not as a symptom of Wall Street greed. And though those catering and spa bills were huge by hospitality standards, they're a pittance compared to the losses incurred dabbling in mortgage-backed securities.
 
Obama's comments suggest a misunderstanding of the details behind AIG’s collapse, or a deliberate effort to skip over the realities of AIG's corporate structure in order to make a good point. Also, Obama slams AIG for two junkets at a time when the company had only held one. AIG might have had a tin ear when it came to organizing corporate events. But Obama’s wrong to lay blame for the financial meltdown on a highly regulated, profitable part of the business that sells life insurance. We rule the claim Barely True.

Report finds Palin violated ethics laws
","
In the scouring of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin’s political closet, perhaps no issue has loomed as large as ""Troopergate"" — the allegations that Palin improperly exerted her influence as governor to try to get her estranged former brother-in-law fired from his job as a state trooper.
 
Alaska State Trooper Mike Wooten was involved in a messy divorce from Palin’s sister, and opponents claimed that Palin went so far as to fire the state’s top cop, Walt Monegan, in July because he refused to fire Wooten.
 
Alaska's 12-member Legislative Council — which has a Republican majority — decided to look into the matter, and in early August, they tapped independent investigator Stephen Branchflower to lead the probe.
 
Branchflower’s

report

, released Oct. 10, concluded that while Palin was within her rights to fire Monegan, she ""abused her power"" and ran afoul of state ethics laws in seeking to settle a score with Wooten.
 
The Palin camp predictably lambasted the report as a partisan smear.
 
Less predictable was the reaction from Palin herself. ""The truth was revealed there in that report that showed there was no unlawful or unethical activity on my part,"" Palin told reporters on Oct. 11.
 
Except that’s not what the report showed.
 
""Finding Number One"" of the report is ""that Governor Sarah Palin abused her power by violating Alaska Statute 39.52.110(a) of the

Alaska Branch Ethics Act

.""
 
Specifically, the statute reads: ""The legislature reaffirms that each public officer holds office as a public trust, and any effort to benefit a personal or financial interest through official action is a violation of that trust.""
 
Branchflower concluded that while Monegan’s refusal to fire Trooper Michael Wooten ""was not the sole reason he was fired by Governor Sarah Palin, it was likely a contributing factor to his termination as Commissioner of Public Safety.""
 
""In spite of that, Governor Palin’s firing of Commissioner Monegan was a proper and lawful exercise of her constitutional and statutory authority to hire and fire executive branch department heads,"" the report states.
 
When a reporter on Oct. 11 asked, ""Governor, did you abuse your power?"" Palin said, ""No, and if you read the report you’ll see that there was nothing unlawful or unethical about replacing a cabinet member. You gotta read the report, sir.""
 
Yes, but when you do read the report, Palin's take on its findings falls apart.
 
As the report explains, in 2005 the Palins lodged numerous complaints against trooper Wooten, including that he made death threats against Palin’s father, Tasered his 10-year-old stepson, drove his patrol car after drinking and ran down and killed a wolf with his snow machine. State troopers investigated his behavior and Wooten was suspended for five days in 2006, before Palin became governor. As far as Monegan was concerned, that should have been the end of it. But according to the report, Palin and her husband continued to aggressively push for Wooten's ouster after Palin became governor. 
 
""The evidence supports the conclusion that Governor Palin, at the least, engaged in ‘official action’ by her inaction if not her active participation or assistance to her husband in attempting to get Trooper Wooten fired (and there is ample evidence of her participation),"" the report states. "" She knowingly...permitted Todd Palin to use the Governor’s office and the resources of the Governor’s office, including access to state employees, to continue to contact subordinate state employees in an effort to find some way to get Trooper Wooten fired.""
 
The report also chides Palin for declining to be interviewed by the investigator.
 
""An interview would have assisted everyone to better understand her motives and perhaps explain why she was so apparently intent upon getting Trooper Wooten fired in spite of the fact she knew he had been disciplined following the Administrative Investigation,"" the report states. ""She also knew that he has been permitted to keep his job, and that the disciplinary investigation was closed and could not be reopened. Yet she allowed pressure from her husband, to try to get Trooper Wooten fired, to continue unabated over a several month-period of time.""
 
Branchflower also concluded that Palins’ claims that they feared Wooten ""were not bona fide and were offered to provide cover for the Palin’s real motivation: to get Trooper Wooten fired for personal family related reasons.""
 
In a telephone interview with Alaska reporters on Oct. 11, Palin said she was ""very very pleased to be cleared of any legal wrongdoing … any hint of any kind of unethical activity there. Very pleased to be cleared of any of that. Todd did what anyone would have done given this state trooper’s very, very troubling behavior and his dangerous threats against our family. Todd did what I think any Alaskan would do.""
 
In Altoona, Pa., outside a Sheetz gas station, Palin again claimed the report found she had done nothing illegal or unethical.
 
""I’m thankful that the report has shown that, that there was no illegal or unethical activity there in my choice to replace our commissioner,"" she said.
 
""I don’t micromanage my commissioners and ask them to hire or fire anyone,,"" Palin said, ""and thankfully the truth was revealed there in that report, that showed that there was no unlawful nor unethical activity on my part.""
 
Palin spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt told

ABC News

that when Palin says she’s been cleared of any legal or ethical violations, ""She was referring to the conclusion of the report that found that she acted properly and lawfully with regard to reassigning Monegan, which was the original purpose of the investigation.""
 
The report did, in fact, find that Palin’s firing of Monegan was ""lawful and proper"" but when Palin says - repeatedly - that the report found ""no unlawful or unethical behavior,""she is ignoring the part of the report that concluded she abused her power as governor and violated state ethics laws.
 
Palin has attacked the investigation as a ""partisan circus"" and spokeswoman Meg Stapleton claimed the legislative council ""seriously overreached, making a tortured argument to find fault without basis in law or fact."" The campaign also notes that the council made clear that the vote to make the report public was not an endorsement of its findings, and that five members of the council spoke up to say they did not agree with the report’s findings.
 
Those all may be legitimate arguments, or not. But the issue here is Palin’s characterization that the report concluded that she did not do anything ethically wrong. The report concluded just the opposite. The report says she did abuse her authority and she did violate state ethics laws. By saying otherwise repeatedly, in what seems to be a deliberate attempt to mislead or confuse voters who don't know the facts, Palin isn't just wrong, she's Pants on Fire! wrong.

Lax regulation contributed, among other things
","
The country's economic woes were a somber topic at the presidential debate in Nashville, Tenn., on Oct. 7, 2008, with both candidates explaining their thoughts on the root of the crisis.
 
""Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system,"" Obama said. ""Sen. McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator.""
 
Let's look at what McCain said about deregulation before we get to the more complicated question of what caused the current economic mess.

(See our story and other statements on potential causes of the subprime crisis here.)

 
Obama is referring to an interview John McCain gave to the

Wall Street Journal

's editorial page that published March 3, 3008.
 
Here is the exchange:
 
Question: ""In 1995, when the Republicans won control of both houses of Congress, you proposed a regulatory moratorium, but couldn't get it passed. Would you declare such a moratorium if you were president?""
 
McCain: ""I'm always for less regulation. But I am aware of the view that there is a need for government oversight. I think we found this in the subprime lending crisis — that there are people that game the system and if not outright broke the law, they certainly engaged in unethical conduct which made this problem worse. So I do believe that there is role for oversight.
 
""As far as a need for additional regulations are concerned, I think that depends on the legislative agenda and what the Congress does to some degree, but I am fundamentally a deregulator. I'd like to see a lot of the unnecessary government regulations eliminated, not just a moratorium.
 
""I've thought more on the area of deregulation rather than a moratorium.""
 
So McCain is arguably proud of his reputation as a deregulator, but he says in the same breath that the subprime lending problem is one area that requires oversight. So Obama is leaving out the part of McCain's answer that doesn't suit his purposes in the debate.
 
In this item, however, we're focusing on Obama's other statement, that ""the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.""
 
Deregulation implies regulations that were done away with. In the case of the economic crisis, there was a bit of that. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, gave an exemption to investment banks in 2004 that allowed them to take on much more debt.
 
But credit default swaps were never regulated in the first place. In 1999, Republicans passed legislation, signed by President Clinton, specifically exempting them from regulation.
 
Some regulatory agencies also had regulation powers that they never utilized or didn't utilize well. The Federal Reserve has the power to tighten lending standards, for instance, or raise interest rates. But former Chairman Alan Greenspan discouraged new rules and advised Congress repeatedly not to regulate derivatives.
 
""There were lots of regulatory failures, and it would be reasonable to blame regulators for not detecting problems and acting on them sooner,"" said Charles Calomiris, a professor at Columbia Business School and a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""But deregulation means the removal of regulatory barriers.""
 
But lax regulation contributed significantly to the crisis, in the opinion of another economist.
 
""I put the first blame with the Fed and their failure to rein in the bubble,"" said Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.
 
""They just ignored the proliferation of really bad mortgages,"" Baker said. ""They could have cracked down on this in a number of ways and they chose not to.""
 
Both economists agree that regulatory failures contributed significantly to the problem, but it wasn't the only problem. Also, using the word ""deregulation"" to describe a broad spectrum of regulatory failures is not technically accurate. Obama is right that more rigorous regulation could have helped the situation, but he shorthands it as deregulation and he doesn't mention other contributing factors. For these reasons, we find Obama's statement Half True.

2007 was too late to head off the crisis
","
The country's economic woes were a somber topic at the presidential debate in Nashville, Tenn., on Oct. 7, 2008, with both candidates explaining their thoughts on the root of the crisis.
 
""I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it.""
 
It's undisputed that Obama wrote the two officials a letter on March 22, 2007.
 
""There is grave concern in low-income communities about a potential coming wave of foreclosures,"" Obama wrote. ""Because regulators are partly responsible for creating the environment that is leading to rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market, I urge you immediately to convene a homeownership preservation summit with leading mortgage lenders, investors, loan servicing organizations, consumer advocates, federal regulators and housing-related agencies to assess options for private sector responses to the challenge."" (

Read the full text here

.)
 
But Obama brought up this letter in the context of explaining the current economic crisis. There's nothing to suggest in the letter that Obama had early insights into the events that would unfold in 2008. His letter is concerned with people losing their homes, not a systemic threat to the economic system.
 

(See our story and other statements on potential causes of the economic crisis here.)

 
We also checked news clips to look at Bernanke and Paulson's public statements around the time after Obama sent his letter.
 
• On March 28, 2007, Bernanke testified before Congress, saying,


""Although the turmoil in the






subprime


mortgage market has created financial problems for many individuals and families, the implications of these developments for the housing market as a whole are less clear.""


 


• On May 15, 2007, Bernanke gave a speech in which he discouraged new regulation of derivatives, which played a role in the credit crisis of 2008. ""




We should always keep in view the enormous economic benefits that flow from a healthy and innovative financial sector,"" Bernanke said.


 


• On May 17, 2007, Bernanke said the Federal Reserve was considering taking steps to rein in subprime lending, but would be cautious not to overregulate. ""We do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system,"" Bernanke said.


 


• On June 20, 2007, Paulson said, ""We have had a major housing correction in this country. ... I do believe we are at or near the bottom.""



 


So it sounds like Obama's letter didn't make much of a splash. Certainly Bernanke and Paulson were not sounding alarm bells.


 


We asked two economists, one with a right-leaning group and one with a left-leaning group, if a warning issued in 2007 could have made a difference to the problems of October 2008. Both of them said it was too late by then, because the questionable loans and securities had been issued by that point.



 


""The horse was already out of the barn,"" said Dean Baker,


an economist and co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.
 
""Everyone with a brain who was paying attention knew that there were big problems associated with outstanding subprime risk,"" said Charles Calomiris, a professor at Columbia Business School and a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. But, he added,  ""There was little that the Fed could have done after March 2007 to prevent the crisis from happening.""
 
So Obama is right that he wrote the letter. Saying Bernanke and Paulson didn't do anything about it sounds harsh, but it is a rough approximation of what happened. But Obama's letter was largely confined to the problems of low-income homeowners who were losing their homes. It was not an early warning on the economic collapse of '08. We rate his statement Half True.

Fannie and Freddie contributed to wider problem
","
The country's economic woes created a somber backdrop for the presidential debate in Nashville, Tenn., on Oct. 7, 2008.
 
John McCain explained his view of the roots of the crisis, pinning part of the blame on the Democratic Party.
 
""One of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,"" McCain said. ""I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis. But you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back.""
 
In this item, we'll look at whether Fannie and Freddie were ""the match that lit this fire."" (For the Democrats role in encouraging that,

please see our ruling here.

)
 
First, what are Fannie and Freddie? Set up decades ago by the federal government to underwrite mortgages and promote home ownership, Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.) have become major players in the domestic mortgage market. They do not make loans to homeowners directly, but they purchase mortgages, bundle them into securities, and sell some of them on the open market. Together, Fannie and Freddie owned or guaranteed about $5-trillion in mortgages, about half of the U.S. market.
 
By the summer of 2008, however, the effects of a deflating housing bubble 

-

especially foreclosures and mortgage deliquencies 

-

were affecting Fannie and Freddie, and the agencies didn't have enough money to meet their financial obligations. The U.S. government took them over on Sept. 7, 2008.
 
Getting back to McCain's statement, he suggests that Fannie and Freddie made too many risky loans, and that caused today's crisis. Most economists agree that Fannie and Freddie played a role, but they disagree as to whether they were leading the way or just following the pack.
 
Charles Calomiris, a professor at Columbia Business School and a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said McCain's characterization of Fannie and Freddie as a catalyst is a good one.
 
""As buyers of this paper on such a heavy scale, they helped to make a market in these instruments in a way that encouraged the growth of originations,"" Calomiris said. ""Of course, there were other players in this story, too 

?

loose monetary policy, bad investment decisions by other buyers, and a host of regulatory errors.""
 
Other economists disagree.
 
""The idea that this crisis is fundamentally about Fannie and Freddie is absurd,"" said Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.
 
""They didn't act well in this crisis,"" Baker said. ""They contributed to it. But the primary problem was a housing bubble.""
 
Fannie and Freddie jumped into subprime market to follow the private issuers of mortgage-backed securities.
 
""They were followers, not leaders,"" Baker said.
 
We can see both sides of this argument. Their sheer size supports the argument that they played an outsized role in the problems that led to our financial crisis. But they weren't the first ones to leap into subprime.
 
And there were a number of other factors that contributed to the crisis as well.
 
For example, mortgage-backed securities that appeared to be virtually risk-free on paper, premised as they were on ever-rising home prices, became a huge problem when the housing bubble burst. And, once-obscure derivatives — the credit default swap, a private contract that pays off in case of a defaulted loan — were specifically exempted from government regulation. Today, nobody knows the true value of these investments, given foreclosures and mortgage defaults, and that is what's causing the credit crunch — a general reluctance to lend money.
 
Lax regulation also played a significant role in the crisis. Some regulatory agencies had regulation powers that they never utilized or didn't utilize well. The Federal Reserve has the power to tighten lending standards, for instance, or raise interest rates. But officials there discouraged new rules and advised Congress repeatedly not to regulate derivatives.
 
McCain oversimplifies things and perhaps puts too much emphasis on Fannie and Freddie in order to assign political blame. We rate his statement Half True.

There's plenty of bipartisan blame for crisis
","
In the back-and-forth campaign blame game going on over the financial crisis, Sen. John McCain pointed the finger at Democrats and Obama for failing to support a plan to exert regulatory control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2005 and 2006. 
 
""But you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,"" McCain said at the second presidential debate on Oct. 7. ""I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis. But you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back.
 
""And you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we've got to enact legislation to fix this. We've got to stop this greed and excess.
 
""Meanwhile,"" McCain said, ""the Democrats in the Senate and some

?

and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing. They resisted any change.""
 
Set up decades ago by the federal government to underwrite mortgages and promote home ownership, Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.) became major players in the domestic mortgage market. They don't make loans to homeowners directly, but they purchase mortgages, bundle them into securities, and sell some of them on the open market. Together, Fannie and Freddie owned or guaranteed about $5-trillion in mortgages, about half of the U.S. market.
 
After years of rapid growth in home prices, foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies began rising by 2006. Some homeowners had adjustable-rate mortgages that were resetting to higher rates they could no longer afford. In other cases, speculators were overextended and dumping properties. Outright fraud had some role: people who took out loans never intending to pay them back.
 
Regardless of the reasons, by 2008 foreclosures were affecting Fannie and Freddie. The agencies didn't have enough money to meet their financial obligations, and the U.S. government took them over on Sept. 7.
 
When McCain points an accusing finger at the Democrats for encouraging Fannie and Freddie to make too many risky loans, he's talking about the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act initiated by Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel in 2005. In 2006, McCain signed on to the Republican-led attempt at regulatory overhaul of the mortgage-financing firms, which both went through multibillion-dollar accounting scandals earlier in the decade.
 
The occasion that prompted McCain’s involvement was the release of a 340-page report from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight that concluded that Fannie Mae had manipulated earnings and violated basic accounting principles. It describes an “arrogant and unethical corporate culture” in which executives were more concerned about their bonuses than meeting the company’s housing mission.
 
The findings, based on a 27-month investigation and resulting in a $400-million fine paid to the government, prompted McCain to join other critics and call for more scrutiny of Fannie and its sibling, Freddie Mac.""If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole,"" McCain declared in a May 26, 2006, news release.
 
While McCain is quick to blame Democrats for opposing the legislation — they did — the Republicans controlled Congress at the time, and there was a Republican in the White House. Yet the bill languished in the Senate, and it wasn't until earlier this year that Congress and the Bush administration, shaken by  the extent of the subprime crisis, completed a regulatory overhaul by combining OFHEO and the Federal Housing Finance Board into a new regulatory body, the Federal Housing Finance Agency.
 
We should also note that prior to 2000, support for Fannie and Freddie was more bipartisan. In the late 1990s, the Republican-controlled Congress — with the blessing of Democratic President Bill Clinton — eased the credit requirements on loans that Fannie and Freddie purchased.
 
""It's a bipartisan problem,"" said Bill Beach, director of the Center for Data Analysis at the conservative Heritage Foundation.
 
McCain rightly notes that the 2005-2006 efforts to regulate Fannie and Freddie were Republican-led, and opposed by the Democrats, but McCain's current attempts to depict those efforts as an early warning that could have lessened the current credit crisis don't wash. McCain was talking mostly about potential fallout from accounting troubles, not freewheeling lending standards based on a housing bubble. And he said nothing about major financial institutions becoming badly leveraged on bad loans and new securities products.
 
Even if the 2006 effort to strengthen oversight had succeeded, it’s debatable whether it would have averted the subprime crisis. The extent of the problems was not yet fully known, and it’s a leap of faith to suggest that regulators granted expanded power would have noticed a deterioration in Fannie and Freddie’s loan portfolios soon enough and would have sounded an alarm. 
 
So first, when McCain talks about this legislation, it's not the cure-all he suggests it may have been; the focus then was on corruption in Fannie and Freddie, which isn't really what the financial crisis is about. Democrats may have opposed it, but it didn't appear to have all that many champions in a Republican-controlled Senate, either.  And last, if you look back in time, Democrats and Republicans supported an easing of lending standards in the late 1990s. So for McCain to lay Fannie and Freddie woes entirely at the feet of the Democrats is unfair. We rate his statement Half True.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'John McCain']","
Obama sought the money, but it's no mere projector
","

Note: This item has been updated since it originally was published, with new information that has changed the ruling.

 
Seeking to paint his Democratic rival as a spendthrift, Sen. John McCain highlighted a request Sen. Barack Obama once made to help a Chicago landmark.
 
“He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork-barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3-million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois,” McCain said during the Oct. 7, 2008, presidential debate. “My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?”
 
McCain was referring to a spending request for the 2008 budget. And, indeed, the Web site of Obama’s Senate office shows Obama asked for $3-million for the Adler Planetarium. According to Obama’s office, the equipment had begun to fail and deprived people of a learning experience.
 
“The projection equipment in this theater is 40 years old, and is no longer supported with parts or service by the manufacturer,” his office said in a June 21, 2007, announcement.
 
McCain refers to the item as an ""overhead projector,"" conjuring images of those little projectors on carts in public school libraries all over America, but calling this piece of equipment an overhead projector is like calling the space shuttle a bottle rocket. The projector at Adler that would be replaced is 2½ tons, 18 feet in diameter and elevates from 12 to 20 feet. It's used to display 7,000 stars and planets that are visible, said Mark Webb, director of theaters at Adler. It has motors and gears.
 
“The characterization of it as an overhead projector is not very accurate,” said Webb, who has been at the planetarium more than 25 years.
 
While the museum has not settled on a specific replacement, the $3-million would help cover most of the cost of a new system of projectors. It will be computerized with light sources that would display all the visible stars plus the deep space stars and planets. It would have hard drives and software to transfer megabytes of data, he said. The projector system is part of a $10-million theater upgrade at Adler, the first U.S. location with a planetarium.
 
As PolitiFact has

previously reported

, Obama has sought — but not necessarily received — $931.3-million in spending, including the projector system money. More broadly, annual votes for spending bills mean Obama, like other Congress members, has likely supported a lot more earmarks.
 
But Obama didn’t actually vote for the projector as McCain stated. The request — which was a tenfold hike from a failed request a year earlier — never made it past the Senate appropriations committee, said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense. And Obama isn’t a member of the panel. But Obama did go for the money.
 
“I think for most voters it’s a fine line to draw,” Ellis said.
 
We originally rated McCain’s statement as Mostly True when we confined our review to the earmark issue. But after several readers alerted us to the true nature of the projector, we decided further reporting and study of the details of the project were required. McCain is right that Obama sought the money (though not a vote), but because McCain mischaracterizes the size of the projector to enhance his argument that money is being wasted, we have changed our ruling. We say Half True.

Not a radical group, and Ayers didn't run it
","
For most of the election, Sen. John McCain's campaign has been somewhat subtle about trying to tie Sen. Barack Obama to the former '60s radical William Ayers.
 
No longer. A

90-second Web ad

released Oct. 8, 2008, features sinister music, side-by-side photographs of Obama and Ayers, and a series of dubious allegations about their past connections, including this one:
 
""Ayers and Obama ran a radical education foundation together.""
 
Ayers was a founding member of the militant Vietnam-era anti-war group the Weathermen. He was investigated for his role in a series of domestic bombings, but the charges were dropped in 1974 due to prosecutorial misconduct. He is now an education professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and actively engaged in the city's civic life.
 
The McCain campaign said the ""radical education foundation"" to which they were referring is the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, a charity endowed by publishing magnate Walter Annenberg that funded public-school programs in Chicago from 1995 to 2001.
 
We'll look at whether the foundation was radical. But first we have to grapple with whether Obama and Ayers ran it.
 
Obama served on the foundation's volunteer board from its inception in 1995 through its dissolution in 2001, and was chair for the first four years. So an argument can be made that he ran it, though an executive director handled day-to-day operations.
 
Ayers, who received his doctorate in education from Columbia University in 1987 and is now a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, was active in getting the foundation up and running. He and two other activists led the effort to secure the grant from Annenberg, and he worked without pay in the early months of 1995, prior to the board's hiring of an executive director, to help the foundation get incorporated and formulate its bylaws, said Ken Rolling, who was the foundation's only executive director. Ayers went on to become a member of the ""collaborative,"" an advisory group that advised the board of directors and the staff.
 
However, Ayers ""was never on the board of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge,"" and he ""never made a decision programmatically or had a vote,"" Rolling said.
 
""He (Ayers) was at board meetings — which, by the way, were open — as a guest,"" Rolling said. ""That is not anything near Bill Ayers and Barack Obama running the Chicago Annenberg Challenge.""
 
Now, was the foundation radical?
 
The McCain campaign cited several pieces of evidence for that allegation, including a 1995 invitation from the foundation for applications from schools ""that want to make radical changes in the way teachers teach and students learn."" The campaign appears to have confused

two different definitions

  of the word ""radical."" Clearly the invitation referred to ""a considerable departure from the usual or traditional,"" rather than ""advocating extreme measures to retain or restore a political state of affairs.""
 
The campaign also cited two projects the foundation funded, one having to do with a United Nations-themed Peace School and another that focused on African-American studies.
 
""That is radical in the eye of this campaign and we imagine in the eyes of most Americans,"" said Michael Goldfarb, a spokesman for McCain. ""It is a subjective thing, and there are going to be people in Berkeley and Chicago who think that is totally legitimate.""
 
Teaching about the United Nations and African-American studies may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's hardly ""radical"" in the same way Ayers' Vietnam-era activities were. Moreover, most of the projects the foundation funded (more on that below) were not remotely controversial.
 
The McCain campaign also cited an opinion piece by conservative commentator Stanley Kurtz in the Sept. 23, 2008,

Wall Street Journal

as evidence of the foundation's radicalism. Kurtz wrote that Ayers was the ""guiding spirit"" of the foundation, and it ""translated Mr. Ayers's radicalism into practice.""
 
But Ayers' views on education, though certainly reform-oriented and left-of-center, are not considered anywhere near as radical as his Vietnam-era views on war. And even if they were, there was a long list of individuals involved with the Chicago Annenberg Challenge whose positions provided them far more authority over its direction than Ayers' advisory role gave him.
 
Let's look at a few, starting with the funder. Annenberg was a lifelong Republican and former ambassador to the United Kingdom under President Richard Nixon. His widow, Leonore, has endorsed McCain. Kurtz might just as plausibly have accused Obama and the foundation of ""translating Annenberg's conservatism into practice.""
 
Among the other board members who served with Obama were: Stanley Ikenberry, former president of the University of Illinois; Arnold Weber, former president of Northwestern University and assistant secretary of labor in the Nixon administration; Scott Smith, then publisher of the Chicago Tribune; venture capitalist Edward Bottum; John McCarter, president of the Field Museum; Patricia Albjerg Graham, former dean of the Harvard University Graduate School of Education, and a host of other mainstream folks.
 
""The whole idea of it being radical when it was this tie of blue-chip, white-collar, CEOs and civic leaders is just ridiculous,"" said the foundation's former development director, Marianne Philbin.
 
The foundation gave money to groups of public schools – usually three to 10 – who partnered with some sort of outside organization to improve their students' achievement.
 
In his opinion piece, Kurtz puts a sinister spin on this: ""Instead of funding schools directly, it required schools to affiliate with 'external partners,' which actually got the money...CAC disbursed money through various far-left community organizers, such as the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (or ACORN).""
 
Rollings said the foundation tried to fund the schools directly, but doing so proved to be a ""bureaucratic nightmare."" But any external group that received money had to have created a program in partnership with a network of public schools.
 
And though ACORN is considered a liberal organization, the vast majority of the foundation's external partners were not remotely controversial. Here are a few examples: the Chicago Symphony, the University of Chicago, Loyola University, Northwestern University, the Chicago Children's Museum, the Museum of Science and Industry, the Field Museum, the Commercial Club of Chicago, the Garfield Park Conservatory Alliance and the Logan Square Neighborhood Association.
 
Had Kurtz chosen to accuse Obama of carrying water for the conservative Annenberg, he might have written: ""CAC disbursed money to various business-friendly entities, such as the Museum of Science and Industry and the Commercial Club of Chicago.""
 
See how easy it is?
 
The programs the foundation funded were designed to allow individuals from the ""external partners"" – whether the musicians in the symphony or the business leaders in the commercial club – to help improve student achievement. They were along the lines of mentoring by artists, literacy instruction, professional development for teachers and administrators, and training for parents in everything from computer skills to helping their children with homework to advocating for their children at school.
 
This last activity – something suburban parents practice with zeal – is also suspect in Kurtz's view: ""CAC records show that board member Arnold Weber was concerned that parents 'organized' by community groups might be viewed by school principals 'as a political threat.'"" That is typical of Kurtz's essay – relatively innocuous facts cast in the worst possible light. That's appropriate for an opinion piece, perhaps, but hardly grounds for a purportedly factual political ad accusing the group of radicalism.
 
We could go on and on with evidence that the Chicago Annenberg Challenge was a rather vanilla charitable group. For example, under the deal with Annenberg every dollar from him had to be matched by two from elsewhere. The co-funders were a host of respected, mainstream institutions, such as the National Science Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and the Chicago Public Schools.
 
In short, this was a mainstream foundation funded by a mainstream, Republican business leader and led by an overwhelmingly mainstream, civic-minded group of individuals. Ayers' involvement in its inception and on an advisory committee do not make it radical – nor does the funding of programs involving the United Nations and African-American studies.
 
This attack is false, but it's more than that – it's malicious. It unfairly tars not just Obama, but all the other prominent, well-respected Chicagoans who also volunteered their time to the foundation. They came from all walks of life and all political backgrounds, and there's ample evidence their mission was nothing more than improving ailing public schools in Chicago. Yet in the heat of a political campaign they have been accused of financing radicalism. That's Pants on Fire wrong.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'National Right to Life Committee']","
2003 legislation had neutrality clause
","
The hot-button issue of abortion is the subject of two recent political ads and a controversy centering on Barack Obama's votes in the Illinois legislature. 
An independent advocacy group, BornAliveTruth.org, launched an attack ad on Obama, and the Obama campaign responded with an attack on John McCain's abortion record. For more on these dueling ads,  read our story here.  
As the controversy around the ads played out, the National Right to Life Committee disputed some of Obama's public comments about Illinois legislation concerning infants ""born alive,"" particularly a crucial bit of the legislation that became known as the ""neutrality clause."" The committee said the legislation had a neutrality clause; Obama said it didn't. 
Here's the background: Opponents of abortion put forward legislation in 2001, 2002 and 2003 intended to require doctors to provide immediate life-saving care to any infant that survived an intended abortion. The legislation, which included multiple bills, specified that an infant surviving a planned abortion is ""born alive"" and ""shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law."" 
The bills' supporters said it gave added emphasis to laws already on the books, deterring the death of abortion survivors from neglect. One of the bills' strongest supporters was a nurse, Jill Stanek, who said she had witnessed infants left to die in dirty utility rooms. Abortion-rights proponents, on the other hand, said the legislation was a back-door attempt to stop legal abortions.  
Illinois already had a law on its books from 1975 that said if a doctor suspected an abortion was scheduled for a viable fetus — meaning able to survive outside of the mother's body — then the child must receive medical care if it survives the abortion. The new laws didn't distinguish between viable and nonviable, meaning that an infant of any age that survived an abortion should receive care.  
We'll state at the outset here that Obama, along with other Democrats in the Illinois legislature, opposed the ""born alive"" laws every time they came up, and this is not disputed. Why he opposed the legislation has become a controversial point during the presidential campaign, however. 
The controversy hinges on how the two sides interpret the ""neutrality clause."" 
In 2002, two years before Obama was elected to the Senate, the U.S. Congress took up its own version of ""born alive"" legislation, and passed it with a so-called ""neutrality clause,"" which said the law would not change the legal status or legal rights of anyone prior to being ""born alive."" Abortion rights advocates said the clause was necessary to make sure the bill would not affect current abortion laws. 
Obama has said as far back as 2004 that he would have supported the federal bill and that he would have supported the Illinois versions if they had had a similar neutrality clause. The laws the full Senate voted on in 2001 and 2002 did not have such a clause, but 2003 is a different story. 
The National Right to Life Committee says the 2003 bill did have a neutrality clause, and contends that Obama is misrepresenting the bill. David Brody of CBN News, a Christian news group, asked Obama for his response to that in August 2008. 
""I hate to say that people are lying, but here's a situation where folks are lying,"" Obama said. ""I have said repeatedly that I would have been completely in, fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion."" Read his  entire answer on the CBN Web site  . 
We requested documentation from the Illinois State Archives about the 2003 bill and found that it did have a neutrality clause, as the National Right to Life said. The clause was added at the committee level, and those records are not available online. But we have posted  the documents we received via fax from the State Archives here. 
The records are from the Health and Human Services Committee. They show that on March 12, 2003, the committee voted unanimously to add a neutrality clause to the ""born alive"" bill. Then the committee voted down the bill on a 6-4 vote. All the Democrats on the committee, including Obama, voted against the legislation, while the Republicans favored it. 
But there is an important caveat to add here: We don't know what the discussion was at the 2003 committee because the proceedings weren't recorded, but it seems likely that the federal neutrality clause was not considered sufficient at the state level, because the 2005 Illinois law that eventually passed included a more extensive neutrality clause than the federal legislation. 
Let's compare the language of the various neutrality clauses. 
The federal born alive legislation has passed and was the law at the time of the 2003 vote. Here's what its neutrality clause states: 
""Nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm, deny, expand, or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being ‘born alive’ as defined in this section."" 
The 2003 amendment that was before the Illinois Senate committee said this: 
""Nothing in this Section shall be construed to affirm, deny, expand, or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this Section."" 
Except for minor punctuation, the clauses are identical. 
But here's the neutrality clause that was included in the successful Illinois ""born alive"" legislation of 2005. Note that it has two additional paragraphs. 
""Nothing in this Section shall be construed to affirm, deny, expand, or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive, as defined in this Section."" 
""Nothing in this Section shall be construed to affect existing federal or State law regarding abortion."" 
""Nothing in this Section shall be construed to alter generally accepted medical standards."" 
So the National Right to Life Committee is correct that the 2003 legislation did have a neutrality clause similar to the federal legislation. But the federal neutrality clause wasn't sufficient to reassure the Illinois legislators seeking to protect abortion rights. The law that passed had additional explicit protection for existing state law and generally accepted medical standards. The bill's sponsor said in 2008 that the extra language was included to satisfy ""the most zealous prochoice legislators."" 
But the National Right to Life Committee is correct that the 2003 version of the law did include a neutrality clause similar to the federal legislation, and Obama voted against it. We rule its claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B95CC0>],/factchecks/2008/oct/09/national-right-life-committee/2003-legislation-had-neutrality-clause/

Obama's plan expands existing system
","
Barack Obama defended his health care plan during a debate in Nashville, Tenn., on Oct. 7, 2008. His opponents have attacked his plan as ""government-run"" health care.
 
""No. 1, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it,"" Obama said. ""All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. You'll still have choice of doctor.""
 
Obama is accurately describing his health care plan here. He advocates a program that seeks to build on the current system, rather than dismantling it and starting over.
 
Obama's plan essentially takes today's system and seeks to expand it to the uninsured. It creates national pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. It increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. And it has several strategies to rein in costs for everyone, such as streamlining medical record-keeping and emphasizing preventive care.
 
Obama has said he would like his plan to be universal, in that everyone has health care coverage. But currently it includes a mandate only for children. Obama has said that he did not include a mandate for adults so as not to penalize people with modest incomes.
 
It remains to be seen whether Obama's plan will actually be able to achieve the cost savings it promises for the health care system. But people who want to keep their current insurance should be able to do that under Obama's plan. His description of his plan is accurate, and we rate his statement True.

GOP changes to Wisconsin's John Doe law create exceptions for politicians, Democratic lawmaker says
","Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature are pushing a bill that would change the state’s so-called John Doe law, which allows for criminal investigations -- like two that were related to Gov. Scott Walker -- to be done in secret. On Oct. 20, 2015, GOP Rep. David Craig of suburban Milwaukee insisted on a radio talk show that the changes made by his bill would not exempt politicians in any way from John Doe investigations. But later that day, during debate on the Assembly floor, Democrats repeatedly said just the opposite. ""We are creating exceptions in the law for politicians,"" said state Rep. Chris Danou of Trempealeau. Is Danou right? What a John Doe is John Doe investigations are done to determine whether a crime has occurred and, if so, by whom. Unlike standard criminal investigations, law enforcement officials in a John Doe have special powers. They can compel the testimony of reluctant witnesses under oath and issue subpoenas requiring witnesses to turn over documents. Another key difference is that a judge overseeing a John Doe can -- and typically does -- order that the proceedings be done in secret, unlike the vast majority of court proceedings. Scott Walker In May 2010, when Walker was Milwaukee County executive, Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, launched what would become a nearly three-year-long John Doe targeting Walker’s aides and associates. Six people, including three county executive employees, one Walker appointee and a major Walker campaign contributor, were convicted of a variety of crimes. In August 2012, weeks after Walker won a historic recall election to remain as governor, Chisholm opened another John Doe. It focused on whether the Wisconsin Club for Growth and other conservative groups illegally coordinated with Walker's campaign. Later, the probe was expanded to four other counties and former federal prosecutor Francis Schmitz, who has described himself as a Republican, was added as a special prosecutor.   In July 2015, the state Supreme Court shut down the investigation, saying the governor's campaign and the groups had not violated campaign finance laws. Walker and other Republicans have described the probe as a political witch hunt, and the bill to make changes in the John Doe process was largely prompted by that probe. Proposed changes Under current law, any crime may be investigated under a John Doe proceeding, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Council. But under the bill, the crimes that could be investigated with a John Doe proceeding are limited to certain felonies. Those include murder, rape, armed robbery and numerous other serious crimes, as well as lesser crimes of a violent nature. Republicans argue that the bill limits what crimes a John Doe proceeding can be used to investigate, not who can be investigated. That’s true; there’s nothing in the bill that says politicians are exempt. But the proposed restrictions mean a John Doe investigation could no longer be used to look into a variety of political crimes. News reports have been clear on this. For instance, a John Doe could no longer be used to investigate allegations of bribing public officials, using elected office for personal gain and corruptly influencing legislation, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Political corruption charges are exempted, noted the Wall Street Journal. The bill would end John Doe probes into political misconduct, said the Associated Press. To be clear, political crimes wouldn’t be the only ones exempted. If the bill became law, authorities would no longer be able to use a John Doe to look into crimes such as identity theft, mortgage fraud, dealing small amounts of heroin and cocaine, or theft reaching into the millions of dollars. But the political focus of the proposed changes has always been clear. Indeed, when Craig introduced the bill in February 2015, he said it would mean John Doe investigations could not be conducted for most political crimes. Prosecutors should use standard investigations or launch grand jury probes to look into those types of allegations, he said at the time. Wisconsin's grand jury law is rarely used and Democrats argue it would be costly and inefficient to use for political crimes. Craig’s bill was approved by the Assembly on the day of the floor debate and was adopted by the Senate the next day. Walker’s spokeswoman has said the governor would evaluate the legislation, but added he supports ""common-sense reforms that protect free speech and ensure transparency and accountability"" for John Doe investigations. Our rating Danou said a Republican bill that would change John Doe criminal investigations is ""creating exceptions in the law for politicians."" The bill would not exempt politicians from John Doe investigations, which under current law can be conducted for any crime. But the bill does create an exception in that John Doe probes could no longer be used to investigate political corruption. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BFCB80>],/factchecks/2015/oct/22/chris-danou/gop-changes-wisconsins-john-doe-law-create-excepti/

In next chapter of Sanders-Clinton conspiracy theory, graphic takes aim at CNN's polling operation
","A few days ago, we waded into the debate over a conspiracy theory circulating among some supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders -- the one that has CNN, among other media outlets, keeping favorable post-debate poll results for Sanders under wraps because the network, and other parts of the media establishment, are in the tank for Hillary Clinton. After we gave a Pants on Fire rating to the claim that CNN deleted from its website an online poll favorable to Sanders, many readers attacked PolitiFact as being part of this conspiracy against Sanders. Nonetheless, we’ve decided to wade in again after a reader sent us a Facebook post that added a new wrinkle to the alleged CNN conspiracy. The reader sent us a post that showed an image of results from a CNN-ORC International poll taken between Oct. 14 and 17. On the image, two columns were circled in red -- two columns of sub-results by age group for a question about how favorably or unfavorably the respondent views Hillary Clinton. The two columns show responses for survey participants ages 18 to 34 and ages 35 to 49. Every possible answer in those columns has been marked N/A -- ""not applicable."" The creator of the image was dumbfounded, slapping this comment on the image in big red type: ""CNN's Crap Polling: No one under the age of 50 has an opinion of Hillary Clinton?"" The reader who contacted PolitiFact wondered whether the image creator’s question was legitimate, so we took a closer look. Bottom line: It’s all a misunderstanding about how CNN reports the results of its surveys. (After we emailed questions to the person who had posted it on their Facebook page, we didn’t receive a response, but the post was pulled down. We saved a screenshot, above.) The easiest way to debunk the graphic’s assumption is to look a few columns to the right. There, one can find a heading that reads ""under 50,"" with 74 percent of respondents in that age group saying they feel favorably about Clinton, 23 percent saying they feel unfavorably, 3 percent saying they have no opinion and 1 percent saying they’ve never heard of her. (Our real question: Who belongs to the 1 percent who have never heard of Hillary Clinton?) So this column of poll results clearly shows that people under 50 did tell the survey takers about their opinions about Clinton. What about those mysterious columns full of ""N/A""? They are there because of CNN’s polling policy. The policy is explained fully in the same document that the Facebook image was drawn from, though it appears on an earlier page not shown in the Facebook post. This section explains the CNN policy on ""crosstabs"" -- the polling industry’s term for results sorted by demographic subcategories such as age, race, gender or income level. ""Crosstabs on the following pages only include results for subgroups with enough unweighted cases to produce a sampling error of +/- 8.5 percentage points or less,"" CNN wrote. ""Some subgroups represent too small a share of the national population to produce crosstabs with an acceptable sampling error. Interviews were conducted among these subgroups, but results for groups with a sampling error larger than +/-8.5 percentage points are not displayed and instead are denoted with ‘N/A.’ "" In other words, for the age ranges 18 to 34 and 35 to 49, the survey reached too few people to produce a statistically valid sample -- so to avoid publishing questionable numbers, CNN simply reported them as ""N/A."" This pattern -- categories with larger sample sizes given specific figures, and those with smaller sample size marked ""N/A"" -- is echoed elsewhere in the full document. ""The CNN/ORC polls are highly regarded,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. ""They are one of the few partnerships to provide us subgroup data, which is invaluable. The Facebook question does a disservice to the poll."" Our ruling The Internet graphic accused CNN of being such an incompetent pollster that it found that ""no one under the age of 50 has an opinion of Hillary Clinton."" This is based on a misreading of the CNN-sponsored poll. Two age-range subcategories produced too few respondents to qualify as statistically valid results under CNN’s threshold, which was plainly spelled out in the survey-results document. The claim is even debunked on the graphic itself -- it showed a category with actual results for respondents under the age of 50. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

Donald Trump says CIA warned George W. Bush of Sept. 11 attacks
","The war of words between GOP presidential hopefuls Jeb Bush and Donald Trump continues, with the most recent clash coming over the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the response of Bush’s brother, President George W. Bush. Jeb Bush has stated several times that his brother kept America safe. Trump said that ignores a crucial fact -- that George W. Bush failed to stop the Sept. 11 attacks. Worse yet, Trump said on Oct. 20, 2015, that Bush knew the 2001 attacks were coming. ""His brother could have made some mistakes with respect to the actual hit because they did know it was coming and George Tenet, the head of the CIA, told them it was coming,"" Trump said on CNN’s New Day. ""So they did have advanced notice and they didn’t really work on it."" Our question here is simple: Did Tenet and the CIA tell the Bush administration that an attack on U.S. soil was imminent? The answer comes from a special commission created to investigate the Sept. 11 attacks. (Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.) ‘The system was blinking red’ Tenet told staff for the commission, formally the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States, that ""the system was blinking red"" in the months before the September 2001 attacks. ""Threat reports surged in June and July, reaching an even higher peak of urgency,"" the commission report said. ""The summer threats seemed to be focused on Saudi Arabia, Israel, Bahrain, Kuwait, Yemen, and possibly Rome, but the danger could be anywhere -- including a possible attack on the G-8 summit in Genoa."" Despite the chatter, there were doubters. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz thought perhaps Osama bin Ladin was trying to study U.S. reactions. Tenet shot that down. The report said that on Aug. 3, 2001, ""the intelligence community issued an advisory concluding that the threat of impending al Qaeda attacks would likely continue indefinitely. Citing threats in the Arabian Peninsula, Jordan, Israel, and Europe, the advisory suggested that al Qaeda was lying in wait and searching for gaps in security before moving forward with the planned attacks."" The commission’s timeline revealed a consensus that the target lay outside America’s borders. The one prominent exception came in an Aug. 6 briefing document written by two CIA analysts. They titled it ""Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in US.""  Essentially, the briefing document stated that bin Laden said he wanted to attack the United States directly and was expected to plan patiently. It spoke of an unconfirmed warning from 1998 that planes might be hijacked to win the release of imprisoned extremists and noted suspicious surveillance of federal buildings in New York. It noted that 70 investigations were underway in the United States. The closest it came to what actually took place was ""CIA and the FBI are investigating a call to our Embassy in the UAE in May saying that a group of Bin Ladin supporters was in the US planning attacks with explosives."" What Bush knew The commission interviewed George W. Bush as part of its investigation and included his response to the briefing document. They write:  ""The President told us the August 6 report was historical in nature. President Bush said the article told him that al Qaeda was dangerous, which he said he had known since he had become President. The President said Bin Ladin had long been talking about his desire to attack America. He recalled some operational data on the FBI, and remembered thinking it was heartening that 70 investigations were under way. As best he could recollect, (National Security Adviser Condoleeza) Rice had mentioned that the Yemenis' surveillance of a federal building in New York had been looked into in May and June, but there was no actionable intelligence."" The commission report goes on to say that the briefing document led to no meetings of the interagency Counterterrorism Security Group or the National Security Council to discuss a domestic attack. Tenet met with Bush two more times in August and on Sept. 10. Tenet said he didn’t remember talking to Bush about a domestic threat. News reports since 2004 have described in detail the frustrations intelligence officials like Tenet had in trying to get the White House to focus on Bin Ladin. But none suggest that Tenet thought a domestic strike was likely. Brian Finlay, president of the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank, said the Aug. 6 article contained no specific information that would have ""prevented the tragedy of that day."" ""One would have to willingly suspend disbelief to presume that any American official responsible for the national security of our country would have failed to act in the face of clear evidence of an imminent attack,"" Finlay said. Trump’s accusation ""is simply off-base,"" Finlay said. Our ruling Trump claims that the CIA told the Bush administration that a domestic terror attack was coming. The report assembled over a span of three years after Sept. 11, 2001, found no specific alert. The potential for a domestic attack was discussed in early August, but it was mentioned only in broad terms and was not brought back up. Investigative reports in the years since found that the CIA warnings emphasized possible targets overseas. Tenet told investigators that as late as Sept. 10 he did not talk about a domestic attack with the president. There’s no support that Bush and top White House officials had, as Trump said, ""advanced notice"" of an attack on New York City or any other place in America. We rate this claim False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B15D80>],/factchecks/2015/oct/21/donald-trump/trump-says-cia-warned-president-bush-9-11-attacks/

Hillary Clinton says U.S. loses 90 people a day to guns
","Rallying supporters in San Antonio, Hillary Clinton said Oct. 15, 2015, that she’s running for president in part ""to protect our families and communities from the plague of gun violence."" Clinton, who was introduced and endorsed by Julián Castro, the former San Antonio mayor serving as secretary of Housing and Urban Development, went on: ""Look, you know, we lose an average of 90 Americans every day because of guns."" Is that so? Earlier in the week, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state aired the same per-day count at the Democratic presidential debate hosted by CNN. On her campaign website, Clinton says she favors more pre-purchase background checks, ""cracking down on illegal gun traffickers, holding dealers and manufacturers accountable when they endanger Americans, and keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and stalkers."" A subsequent check of Clinton’s 90 gun deaths by FactCheck.org, based at the University of Pennsylvania, found that while Clinton’s figure held up for 2013, the last year of available data, it is worth noting that only one-third of firearm deaths consisted of homicides; most other gun deaths counted as suicides. At least once, Clinton has clarified her figure by mentioning suicides; according to an Oct. 7, 2015, post on her campaign website, she said in Muscatine, Iowa: ""We lose between 88 and 92 Americans a day from gun violence — homicides, suicides and accidents — and we have to act."" Let’s go to the numbers. Federal statistics According to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 33,636 U.S. firearm deaths were recorded in 2013 — or 92 a day, on average. Some 63 percent of that year’s firearm deaths, or 21,175, were suicides, with 11,208 considered homicides and the rest classified as unintentional discharges (505), legal intervention/war (467) and undetermined (281). We confirmed those figures and checked the numbers for the four previous years (2009-12), finding a five-year average of 89 firearm deaths a day. In that period, the low was 86 firearm deaths a day in 2009 while the 2012 and 2013 averages tied at 92. For each year too, suicides by firearm accounted for far more deaths than homicides by firearm. Government statistician Next, we reached out to the CDC. By email, statistician Ken Kochanek said the 2013 figures remain the latest available. To our request, Kochanek drew on the agency’s statistics to create a document showing that the rate of U.S. deaths by firearm in 2013, roughly 10.6 per 100,000 residents, exceeded the rate of 10.4 per 100,0000 residents for 1999 through 2013. The 15-year high was set in 2012 — 10.7 per 100,000 residents. The 15-year low was set in 2004 — 10.1 firearm deaths per 100,000 residents. Asked to focus on homicides by firearm, Kochanek emailed a document indicating the 2013 rate of 3.5 homicides by firearm per 100,000 residents was less than the 3.9 homicides by firearm per 100,000 residents over the 15-year period. Over those years, the highest rate, of 4.3 homicides by firearm per 100,000 residents, was set in 2006 and the lowest rate, 3.6 homicides by firearm per 100,000 residents was set in two years, 2010 and 2011. Our ruling Clinton said: ""We lose an average of 90 Americans every day because of guns."" That’s about right. But it leaves unsaid that the bulk of those deaths are suicides, not homicides. Also, in 2013, the latest year of available data, the rate of homicides by firearm was lower than the rate for 1999 through 2013. We rate this statement Mostly True.

Trump: Bernie Sanders wants to tax 'you people' at 90 percent
","At a recent rally in Richmond, Va., Donald Trump called Bernie Sanders the c-word — ""communist"" — and suggested that Sanders’ plans for wealth redistribution extends beyond targeting Trump and other billionaires. Under Sanders, Trump said, tax hikes would come for everyone. ""This maniac that was standing on (Hillary Clinton’s) right is giving everything away, so she’s following,"" Trump said on Oct. 14, referring to the Democratic debate the night before. ""He’s gonna tax you people at 90 percent. He’s gonna take everything. And nobody's heard the term communist, but you know what? I’d call him a socialist/communist, okay? ‘Cause that's what he is."" A few days later, Sanders dismissed Trump’s comments in an interview on ABC’s This Week. ""Well, if I had to respond to every absurd thing that Donald Trump said, I would spend my whole life doing it,"" Sanders said in the Oct. 18 interview. He added, ""Yes, we are going to ask Trump and his billionaire friends to pay more in taxes. ...We'll come up with that rate. But it will be a damned lot higher than it is right now."" It’s clear that Sanders wants to raise taxes on the ""1 percent."" But does he want to tax the average Americans standing before Trump at the Richmond rally at 90 percent as well? Sanders hasn’t released a tax plan yet, and we searched Lexis Nexis and CQ and found that Sanders has never explicitly proposed a 90 percent tax rate for billionaires, let alone applying that rate across the board. We asked the Trump campaign how the GOP frontrunner knew what Sanders is proposing, but we didn’t hear back. However, he may be distorting comments Sanders made in May 2015 about the marginal tax rate for the very wealthy. Just like Ike Early in his campaign, Sanders drew alarm when he said in an interview with CNBC that he doesn’t think a top marginal tax rate of 90 percent is too high. Briefly, the marginal tax rate is applied to the last dollar you earn. The U.S. tax system is based on tax brackets. Let’s say you were a single filer who earned $410,000 in adjusted gross income last year. The first $9,075 you earned was taxed at 10 percent, the amount from $9,076 to $36,900 was taxed at 15 percent, the amount from $36,901 to $89,350 was taxed at 25 percent, the amount from $89,351 to $186,350 was taxed at 28 percent, the amount from $186,351 to $405,100 was taxed at 33 percent, the amount from $405,101 to $406,750 was taxed at 35 percent, and the amount above $406,751 was taxed at 39.6 percent. In other words, the current top marginal tax rate is 39.6 percent, affecting individuals who make more than $400,000 a year. That’s roughly the threshold to make it into the top 1 percent of incomes if you’re filing as an individual. And even for this sample filer making $410,000, that 39.6 percent tax rate hits only a relatively small amount of their income. The average American never sees marginal federal income tax rates that high. ""If my memory is correct, when radical socialist Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, the highest marginal tax rate was something like 90 percent,"" Sanders said on May 26 (his memory is correct). ""That's not 90 percent of your income, you know? That's the marginal."" Many on the right and left interpreted Sander’ comments as advocating for increasing the top rate to 90 percent. The Sanders camp, however, told us the Vermont senator has made it very clear that that’s not what he was saying. Looking at his past comments — one from 2008, four from this year — Sanders doesn’t seem like he’s committed to any figure: • Nov. 5, 2008 on Fox News’ Your World with Neil Cavuto: Sanders said of the top tax rate, ""No, of course, it is not going to be 90 percent."" Pressed by Cavuto for a figure, Sanders said, ""Neil, I’m not going to develop tax policy in a three-minute segment on your show."" • June 2, 2015 on Yahoo! News: In response to host Katie Couric’s suggestion that he proposed taxing the wealthiest Americans at 90 percent, Sanders interjected, ""No, I didn’t. It’s not true. That’s one of these things that seems to be circulating. We haven’t come up with a formal tax proposal. ...Will we raise the individual tax rate for the wealthy? Absolutely, but we haven’t come up with a number yet."" • June 11, 2015 on Charlie Rose: ""We are working right now on a comprehensive tax package which I suspect will for the top marginal rates go over 50 percent."" • Sept. 18, 2015 on CBS This Morning: ""No, I don’t think you have to go up to 90 percent. …I don’t know if you have to go there but we will come up with some very specific ideas."" • Sept. 23, 2015 on CNN New Day: ""If you are extremely wealthy, yes, you are going to pay more in taxes. If you are a large corporation today, by the way, that's stashing your money in the Cayman Islands and not paying a nickel in federal taxes, yes, you are going to be paying taxes."" In short, the most specific figure we found from Sanders on the top marginal tax rate is not terribly specific — ""over 50 percent"" — and it would not affect all but a tiny fraction of Americans. Nothing is certain but taxing corporations And that’s the point that’s even more problematic with Trump’s claim -- who Sanders’ supposed 90 percent tax would affect. Most of the taxes that Sanders has actually proposed in writing would not apply to ""you people."" The one exception would raise the rate to far below 90 percent. His call for paid family and medical leave, based on legislation introduced by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., would require ""just a small increase in the payroll tax"" that would hit everyone, Sanders said on This Week. How small? Employers and employees would chip in an additional 0.2 percent each, bringing the federal payroll tax from 12.4 percent to 12.8 percent. According to a report by Gillibrand’s office, that’s the equivalent of $72.04 per year for the average worker, and $227.40 for the highest wage earners. For corporations and the very wealthy, Sanders’ proposed tax increases and new taxes may hurt more. Here’s a rundown: • Increase the top estate tax rate from 40 percent to 45 percent for estates valued at $3.5 million to $10 million; 50 percent for $10 million to $50 million; 55 percent for $50 million to $1 billion; and 65 percent for estates over $1 billion (estates under $3.5 million will be exempt) • Create a tax on trading transactions that would impose a 0.5 percent rate for stock trades, 0.1 percent for bonds and 0.005 percent for derivatives to pay for free tuition at all public colleges • Eliminate the cap on payroll taxes for incomes over $118,500 and tax all income above $250,000 to expand Social Security • Eliminate tax deferrals for U.S. corporations located abroad and tax breaks for oil, gas and coal companies Beyond this, there’s some doubt that Sanders could achieve his policy proposals without additional tax increases. Indeed, one tax expert cautioned against speculating because Sanders has been so vague about his proposals. ""There is not enough substance to (Sanders’) proposals for anyone to have analyzed them,"" said Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""Organizations typically wait until there is a fully formulated plan before they try to model them. Sanders is not anywhere near that point yet."" Sanders’ director of policy, Warren Gunnels, told us, ""Once he introduces his individual tax reform plan, we'll let you know."" And in turn, we will let you know. Our ruling Trump said Bernie Sanders is going to ""tax you people at 90 percent."" Sanders hasn’t released an official tax plan, either for billionaires or for anyone else. But based on his previous comments and proposals, the tax policies Sanders is advocating are targeted at corporations and affluent Americans. Sanders has dismissed the notion that he wants to set marginal tax rates for billionaires at 90 percent. But even if he did end up doing that, that rate wouldn’t affect ""you people"" — that is, the rank and file Americans who attended Trump’s rally. We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972BD080>],/factchecks/2015/oct/20/donald-trump/trump-bernie-sanders-wants-tax-everyone-90-percent/
"['Campaign Finance', 'Missouri', 'Claire McCaskill']","
Campaign finances more complicated than Claire McCaskill says
","Sen. Claire McCaskill has noticed Republican presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul’s recent drop in the polls, and she thinks she knows why. Paul hasn’t found a financier to bankroll his campaign, she told Bill Maher on his Aug. 21 show. In fact, she said the Kentucky Republican is the only GOP presidential candidate ""who hasn’t found his billionaire to fund his super PAC."" ""You wonder why you don't see Rand Paul as much; he's still shopping for his billionaire,"" McCaskill said. ""He's like the only one who hasn't found a billionaire to fund his super PAC."" With the importance money will play in the 2016 presidential race, we wonder if Paul is the only GOP candidate without a wealthy backer. We reached out to McCaskill for evidence, but her office did not respond. Paul’s big backers McCaskill used the word ""billionaire,"" which is certainly an exclusive club. The problem is there is no easy way to determine who’s a billionaire versus, say, a super-rich millionaire. That’s part of how Donald Trump can say his net worth is $8.7 billion while others peg the number at about $3 billion. Also, it’s important to note that the presidential candidates don't have super PACs because, legally, super PACs and candidates cannot work together, said MU economics professor Jeffrey Milyo. ""The senator’s comment is misleading about the nature of the law, but that sort of sloppiness is very common, in part because the issues are somewhat complex, and in part because it serves the purpose of the speaker,"" Milyo said in an email. Logistics and legalities aside, at the heart of McCaskill's claim is the suggestion that no wealthy supporters have stepped up to support Paul in a big way. That’s not correct. Campaign finance records compiled by OpenSecrets.orgshow that on June 19, Jeff Yass gave $1 million to America's Liberty, a super PAC that supports Paul. He also has given $250,000 to Concerned American Voters, another super PAC that supports Paul. Yass is the founder of Susquehanna International Group, a privately held global trading firm. Yass is rich. How rich is unclear. Reuters described Yass as a billionaire in a June story about campaign giving.PhillyMag.com described Yass as Paul’s ""(very) rich friend in Philadelphia."" Yass doesn’t make Forbes’ 400, but that list includes people with net worths of $1.7 billion or more. Paul has another wealthy backer in Scott Banister, a self-described capitalist who sits on the board of directors for multiple companies. Scott and his wife, Cyan, have served as angel investors for almost 100 companies, including Zappos, according to Fortune. Banister has given a combined $1.2 million to Concerned American Voters. In all, $5 million has been raised for the two super PACs that support Rand Paul. In comparison, Right to Rise, a super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, has a war chest of more than $100 million. Is Banister a billionaire? Again, we don’t know for certain. The other candidates So Paul does have the support of some wealthy donors. And Yass has been described as a billionaire. What about the rest of the crowded GOP field? We found three who don’t appear to have the backing of someone who can write a big check. PACs supporting former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former New York Gov. George Pataki and former Virginia Gov. James Gilmore haven't broken the $1 million mark and haven't received significant help from one donor in particular, Federal Election Commission filings show. Security is Strength, a super PAC that supports Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., lists $500,000 donations from billionairesRobert McNair and Ronald Perelman. Former Arkansas Gov.Mike Huckabee’s super PAC has relied heavily on the support of Ronald Cameron, who donated $3 million, according to OpenSecrets.org. Steve Wynn has supported New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; T. Boone Pickens is helping Bush; and Robert Mercer is with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, according to FEC filings. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has been helped out by Larry Ellison and Norman Braman. Donald Trump has, well, himself. And Republicans aren’t the only ones who have support from wealthy donors. Seven people have given $1 million to the super PAC supporting Democratic frontrunner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, according toOpenSecrets.org. Yet, the numbers don't tell the whole story. As MU political science professor Marvin Overby points out, candidates have been well-funded in past election cycles, but they still failed to secure the nomination. ""A wealthy donor, like casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, can make a candidate, like Newt Gingrich in 2012, more viable for a longer period of time,"" Overby said. ""But there are reasons Gingrich didn’t get the GOP nomination: Despite a wealthy backer, he was the wrong candidate, with the wrong message, and a troubled organization."" Our ruling McCaskill said Paul’s failure to gain traction in the crowded GOP field may have something to do with the fact that Paul is the only candidate to have not found his billionaire. There are two problems with this statement. There are candidates running for president who don’t have a billionaire, and Paul has a reported billionaire backer in Yass.

Ron Johnson was against the Export-Import Bank, and now he supports it
","When General Electric announced plans to cut hundreds of jobs in Waukesha, company executives blamed Congress for failing to renew an obscure federal agency, the Export-Import Bank. Led by a group of conservatives, the House of Representatives over the summer of 2015 efused to reauthorize funding for the bank, which helps U.S. companies sell their goods and services in foreign countries by providing financing for export deals. Those opposed to the bank say it amounts to corporate welfare, while GE officials and other business leaders say it helps the playing field for U.S. companies competing in the global marketplace. Balancing those business interests with a desire for a smaller federal government can create some political complications -- including for U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican. Johnson defeated Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold in 2010 with support of the tea party conservatives who strongly oppose the bank. He faces a tough rematch against Feingold in 2016. In 2012, not long after he took office, Johnson, voted against reauthorization of what is often termed the ""Ex-Im Bank."" Three years later, he had a different take on the organization. Time to to our Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether a politician has changed position on an issue. Our requisite reminder: It does not measure whether any change is good or bad policy or politics, only whether the candidate has been consistent. The Wisconsin picture The bank has been in the news in Wisconsin thanks to the Sept. 28, 2015 announcement by GE that it would cut 350 jobs at its Waukesha operation, which makes engines for the oil and gas industry. The company said it would build a new factory and move the work to Canada because that country has an export credit agency. By that time, Johnson had already voted to support its reauthorization. In the wake of the GE news, Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he had heard from companies that benefitted from the bank and call it an important tool to help them do business overseas. ""They really could not get financing in the private sector for some of their products they wanted to export overseas,"" Johnson said. Johnson also expressed satisfaction with proposed reforms to the way the bank is operated, including increased reserves to protect against loan losses. In short, the senator said, he changed his mind. Despite the Senate action, the bank is in limbo because the House adjourned before taking the matter up, although a reauthorization vote is could come as soon as Oct. 26, 2015. Other changes Johnson was not the only high profile politician to change his views on the bank. Former Texas governor and Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry did a switch in the other direction. He was for the bank in 2014, and then then against it a year later, in the midst of his short-lived presidential campaign. That was rated a Full Flop by PolitiFact Texas. In an op-ed column published by the Wall Street Journal, Perry noted that since since 2007, more than 1,200 Texas companies had obtained help from the Ex-Im Bank in financing more than $24 billion in exports. Still, Perry wrote, he ""can't get on board"" with reauthorizing the charter for the 80-year-old bank: ""I have been deeply disturbed by recent revelations of corruption and bribery at the institution."" Our rating Unlike Perry, Johnson has more than a rhetorical say in the future of the Export-Import Bank. He voted on reauthorization twice in the Senate. First against it, then for it. And that’s a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A730C0>],/factchecks/2015/oct/20/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-export-import-bank/

Trump says U.S. has 'highest tax rate anywhere in the world'
","Donald Trump promised tax cuts to a cheering crowd in Henrico County during his first presidential campaign rally in Virginia on Oct. 14. ""Our taxes - we just put in a plan the other day - we’re going to reduce taxes tremendously because we have the highest tax rate anywhere in the world and our middle class is being absolutely destroyed,"" Trump said. ""It’s being destroyed."" We wondered whether the U.S. really does have the world’s highest tax rate. We asked Trump’s campaign for clarification and evidence but didn’t hear back. So we’ll evaluate Trump’s claim within the context of which he was speaking - of tax burdens affecting most people. That leads us to income taxes. Income tax rates The top income tax rate in the United States is 39.6 percent. That ranked 33rd highest on a list of the top rates in 116 nations compiled this year by KPMG, an international tax advisory corporation. Another survey - by tradingeconomics.com, a website that compiles economic data - ranks the U.S. top rate 38th highest among 155 nations and territories. Chad and Ivory Coast had the highest top tax rates, at 60 percent. The bottom income tax rate in the U.S. is 10 percent. Forty-one countries have higher bottom rates, according to data on 157 nations and territories compiled by Ernst & Young, an international accounting corporation. There’s no precise way to compare middle income tax rates, because most nations don’t have systems as complicated as the seven-bracket tax scale used by the U.S. Keep in mind that all of these figures concern statutory tax rates. Effective tax rates - the percentage actually paid on earned income after deductions - are lower. On average, Americans pay an effective income tax rate of 9.5 percent, according to research by the Tax Policy Center in Washington. We were unable to find a chart of the effective rates in other nations, which have their own rules for deductions and allowances. Tax experts told us that focusing on tax rates - either statutory or effective - is not a meaningful way to compare the tax burdens of nations. The reason is that different countries place different emphasis on certain levies. For example, some nations with high income tax rates may have low payroll taxes and vice versa. Other indicators The experts suggested two different yardsticks for comparing tax burdens in different countries.  One was tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product. The other was tax revenue per capita. Both measures are calculated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 advanced industrialized nations. PolitiFact National has found that for both measurements, many of the United States’ industrialized peers had higher levels of taxation in 2013, the most recent year for which data are available. Taxes accounted for about 25 percent of the United States’ GDP -- placing the U.S. 27th out of 30 countries studied. The five with the highest percentages were Denmark, France, Belgium, Finland and Sweden, each of them with taxation accounting for more than 42 percent of gross domestic product. Only South Korea, Chile and Mexico had lower levels of taxation per GDP than the United States. When looking at tax revenue per capita, the United States ranks somewhat higher but still far from the top. Taxes per capita in the United States totaled $13,482, according to the OECD data. That ranked 16th out of 29 countries for which data were available for 2013. The five with the highest per-capita amounts were Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, with amounts ranging from $23,000 to $48,000. Eleven countries had per-capita amounts less than $10,000, including Hungary, Chile and Turkey, the bottom three on the list. While it probably makes the most sense to compare the United States with other advanced, industrialized nations, there is one additional data source that includes the full roster of countries. In the World Bank’s comparison of 115 countries for 2012, the U.S. ranked 12th from the bottom in taxation as a percentage of GDP. Among the countries with lower percentages were two OECD members (Japan and Spain), some wealthy oil-producing nations (Oman and Kuwait), and a handful of very poor countries (including Afghanistan and the Central African Republic). A final note: We should note that a more specific statement by Trump might have been largely accurate. PolitiFact has given a Mostly True rating to the claim that the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in world, although widespread deductions and exclusions tend to lower the effective corporate rate below the comparative level for some other countries. But Trump didn’t mention corporations when he made his comment. He was lamenting economic problems facing the middle class.   Our ruling Trump, while lamenting the condition of the middle class, said the U.S. has ""the highest tax rate anywhere in the world."" All sets of data we examined for individual and family taxes prove him wrong. Statutory income tax rates in the U.S. fall around the end of the upper quarter of nations. More exhaustive measures - which compute overall tax burden per person and as a percentage of GDP - show the U.S. either is in the middle of the pack or on the lighter end of taxation compared with other advanced industrialized nations. We rate Trump’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C427040>],/factchecks/2015/oct/20/donald-trump/trump-says-us-has-highest-tax-rate-anywhere-world/

Elton John right: South focus of HIV alarm
","Celebrity just keeps elbowing its way into the 2016 presidential race. It could be argued that it started with Donald Trump. The man known best to many Americans as the star of the long-running ""Apprentice"" reality TV show jumped into the presidential race in June and into first place in the crowded field of Republican contenders. And it continued last week in advance of the first Democratic debate. That’s when CNN decided to ask some of the rich and famous what question they’d like to put to candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O’Malley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee. Celebrities Katy Perry and Margaret Cho said they’d pose questions about LGBT rights and the abortion/Planned Parenthood funding flap. Other headliners said they would press the candidates on the hot-button issues of gun control, jobs for the middle class and medical marijuana. Atlanta’s own part-time celebrity-in-residence --  Sir Elton John -- said his question to the candidates would be about his personal passion, the fight against HIV/AIDS. ""In spite of great progress, HIV/AIDS is actually dramatically on the rise in the U.S. South. What would you do as president to help stop this epidemic, particularly among minority communities?"" John said he’d ask. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, about 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV, and about 12.8 percent of them don’t know they’re infected. HIV/AIDS didn’t wind up a discussion point in the first Democratic debate. But PolitiFact Georgia decided John had a point worth checking. Is HIV/AIDS dramatically on the rise in the South? We began our fact-check by contacting the Elton John AIDS Foundation in New York City, asking for evidence backing up John’s statement. The foundation was quick to respond, sending us, among other things, a link to a story that appeared in The Washington Post in September 2014 under the headline ""Southern States are now epicenter of HIV/AIDS in the U.S."" The article quoted Rainey Campbell, then-executive director of the nonprofit Southern AIDS Coalition, as saying Southern states now have the highest rates of new HIV diagnoses, the largest percentage of people living with the disease and the most people dying from it. The foundation also sent a link to a report by the Southern HIV/AIDS Strategy Initiative (SASI) from November 2012, examining HIV epidemiology in the South using 2010 data from the CDC and other government agencies. The report focused on nine states in the South that were identified as ""particularly affected by HIV""  -- Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The targeted states had the highest rates of HIV diagnoses in the United States -- 23.8 per 100,000 -- according to the CDC data, the report found. The South, the report said, makes up a third of the country’s population, but is home to more than half of the new HIV diagnoses. Nine of the 10 metropolitan areas with the highest HIV incidence rates, and seven of the 10 with the highest AIDS incidence rates, were in the targeted states, according to the report. We decided to check in ourselves with the Atlanta-based CDC to see if we could learn more. Ranking regions by the rate of new HIV diagnoses, the South is highest with 24,323 new cases, or a ratio of 20.5 per 100,00 population, based on the latest data available from 2013. Next highest is the Northeast (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont), with 8,908 new HIV diagnoses, or 15.9 per 100,000 population. The West (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming) is next with 8,013 new diagnoses, or 10.8 per 100,000 population. And the last is the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin) with 6,109 new diagnosis, 9 per 100,000 population, according to the CDC. So clearly the South has a big problem. But we still weren’t sure whether any of this proved that HIV/AIDS was rising dramatically in the South. Couldn’t it be that other regions are doing a better job with education/treatment? Nic Carlisle, executive director of the Southern AIDS Coalition, said it’s likely ""a combination of both."" The most recent CDC surveillance report shows the country was making moderate progress until 2011, when the number of new diagnosis started moving in the wrong direction again -- with only the West showing a decrease in 2012-2013, Carlisle said. The increases were 3.4 percent in the Midwest, 3.2 percent in the Northeast, but substantially greater -- 7.5 percent for the South in 2012-2013, he said. ""True, we’ve have made remarkable progress in addressing the HIV epidemic in the United States. Treatment advances have transformed what was once a fatal diagnosis into a chronic disease for many,"" Carlisle said. ""Unfortunately, while the rest of the country reaps the benefits of this progress, the South is in danger of being left behind."" Even the Obama administration recognizes the need to stem the widening HIV-related health disparities that plague the South. In its update to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS), the administration set a goal of reducing disparities in the rate of new diagnoses by at least 15 percent among persons living in the Southern United States, Carlisle said. Patrick Sullivan, a professor at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health who has spent much of his career on HIV/AIDS research, said it’s true that the Southern U.S. is disproportionately impacted by HIV. The increases in new diagnoses in the South are occurring only in specific subgroups, Sullivan said.   ""When we look more specifically at HIV diagnoses among young, 13-24 year old, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in the South, the story is different: according to CDC data, there was a 25 percent increase in new HIV diagnoses in young gay men in the South between 2008 and 2013. For epidemiologists, this is indeed a dramatic increase,"" he said. ""Finally, even when considering the lack of increases in HIV diagnoses in the South overall, it’s important to note that new HIV infections and new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. have both been stubbornly stable at around 45,000 to 50,000 cases each year,"" Sullivan said. ""And in this context, the lack of substantial decreases in new HIV infections is also a dramatic public health problem."" The Elton John AIDS Foundation has made 31 grants worth a combined $1.4 million aimed at addressing the South's HIV/AIDS epidemic. These includes grants worth $315,000 given out earlier this year, in partnership with The Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, to six organizations. The Equality Foundation of Georgia and the Racial Justice Action Center, both in Atlanta, were among the latest grant recipients Our ruling CDC data support the claim of superstar and part-time Atlanta resident Elton John that the South is the region most dramatically affected by the HIV epidemic. Whether that’s because cases are rising in the South or declining in other regions, or a combination of both, is not entirely a clear. Data from 2012-13 shows new HIV diagnoses on the rise in most parts of the country, with the largest -- a 7.5 percent increase -- in the South.    John’s overarching point is that the South has seen an increase in AIDS/HIV, greater than any other region in the nation.  The data supports that. You can quibble about whether there is enough of a trend line to term this a dramatic jump in cases. That takes his statement down a notch on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate John’s statement Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A73480>],/factchecks/2015/oct/19/elton-john/elton-john-right-south-focus-hiv-alarm/

No, Internet, CNN did not delete its poll showing Bernie Sanders won the Democratic debate
","A conspiracy theory rattled the Bernieverse soon after many media outlets, including CNN, pronounced Hillary Clinton the winner of the first Democratic presidential debate. Some of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ supporters said no, Sanders was the clear winner, evidenced by a CNN poll that showed most people thought Sanders was best. The problem: CNN deleted the poll. The theory: CNN deleted the poll to so as not to counter its narrative that Clinton won. A video by NowThis, which shares GIFs and video stories by social media, picked up on a Reddit theory and promoted this video on Twitter and Facebook, teasing, ""It looks like CNN is trying to help Hillary look good, even if that means deleting polls."" Here’s part of the script that was seen by millions: ""The Internet thinks Bernie Sanders totally won the debate. But CNN thinks Hillary won. Even though CNN’s own polls say Bernie won by 68 percent. But that doesn’t concern them. They allegedly just deleted the polls."" The video suggests CNN ""deleted the polls"" showing Sanders won because CNN’s parent company, Time Warner, is ""one of Hillary’s biggest donors,"" spending more on her campaign than ""Bernie’s top 15 donors gave him."" This is just one example of a viral claim. For now, we will skip the part about the conspiracy that focuses on Time Warner’s campaign donations, because there’s a fundamental flaw with these posts. CNN didn’t delete its poll. The poll showing Sanders way ahead is here on Facebook through CNN.com/vote. It’s not on CNN’s website, but it’s not clear that it ever was on CNN’s website.  The original link does not appear to be working on some mobile devices. Try this link if you are having problems with the links above. It should take you to a log-in screen and then show the poll, which has closed. CNN’s digital team used a Facebook app to run live polls of users about what they thought of the debate as it was happening. CNN anchor Don Lemon reported on the strong show of support for Sanders from CNN’s Facebook Lounge on debate night.  Lemon mentioned how Facebook users thought Sanders excelled on foreign policy, economic issues and overall debate performance. So not only did CNN not delete the poll, but the news channel also did not hide it. It might be obvious, but these are clearly non-scientific polls. NowThis attempted to correct its report on Facebook by posting this update on the video’s comment stream: ""Clarification: This was an unofficial social media user poll, and CNN says it's still live on their web site and Facebook page.""  But again, you don't have to take CNN's word for it that the post wasn't deleted, and NowThis can't hide behind the use of the word allegedly. The poll is here for anyone to see. Here's a screengrab we took Oct. 19:  Our ruling Sanders supporters are free to disagree with analysis by journalists and pundits of who won the Democratic debate. What isn’t up for debate, however, is the fact that CNN did not delete its poll of Facebook users, who overwhelmingly said Sanders won the debate. It’s still on a Facebook page managed by CNN. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. We've updated this fact-check to account for some of the issues we've heard from users about opening the links.

2016 GOP candidate Mike Huckabee says DC region 'never has a recession'
","When the rest of the nation is in economic agony, metropolitan Washington doesn’t feel the  pain. So says Mike Huckabee, a Republican presidential candidate and the former governor of Arkansas. Here are his comments during a recent interview with John Fredericks, a Hampton Roads radio talk show host. ""John, you’re close to the Beltway. I don’t have to tell you, it’s the only economy in America that never has a recession,"" Huckabee said during a call-in interview on the show. ""Six out of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C."" We recently looked at Huckabee’s claim that a half-dozen of the 10 wealthiest counties surround D.C. We rated that as True, based on median household income -- a standard way to measure county-wide affluence. Since the D.C. area includes Northern Virginia - an economic engine for the rest of the state -  we wondered if it’s correct that the capital region has been recession-proof. We emailed the Huckabee campaign three times seeking evidence, but no one replied. The basic definition of a recession is a ""marked slippage"" of economic activity, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Economists look at a range of things including personal income growth and employment data to determine if there’s been a downturn. One of the most widely cited definitions of a recession is whether there’s been two consecutive quarters of negative growth in gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced. For the Beltway economy, we looked at Washington and 15 surrounding counties - an area on which analysts typically focus when measuring the economic health of the region. Adam Goldin, an economist at Moody’s Analytics, a company that assesses economic data,  told us it’s incorrect to say the D.C. area hasn’t had a recession. The company’s data show the region experienced consecutive quarters of declining GDP during the 2007-09 Great Recession as well in the early 1980s and early 1990s, Goldin said. ""(During) the Great Recession, D.C. was certainly impacted like the rest of the country,"" Goldin said. The Bureau of Economic Analysis has tracked the growth of every metro region in the nation since 2001; that’s long enough to examine the D.C. area’s economy amid the Great Recession. The figures show D.C. regional growth stalled twice. From 2008 to 2009, the value of all goods and services produced in the region fell slightly from $414.6 billion to $414.3 billion - a drop just shy of one-tenth of 1 percent, according to the BEA. By comparison, the U.S. economy declined 2.8 percent between those years. Output in the D.C. area barely dropped, from $434.5 billion to $434.4 billion, from 2012 to 2013, and the BEA figures list the growth rate then as 0 percent between those years. Although D.C. growth was flat at that time, the U.S. economy grew 1.5 percent from 2012 to 2013. The figures show D.C.’s recent annual GDP declines have been very light. ""That doesn’t mean there weren’t a couple of really bad quarters in there,"" said Terry Clower, director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University. Clower told us that, contrary to Huckabee’s statement, the D.C. area does experience downturns. ""The presence of the federal government does provide a bit of insulation. It doesn’t prevent us from going into recession,"" Clower said. ""Certainly, we have recessions in this region."" Still, Clower doesn’t completely fault Huckabee, noting that it is true that the D.C. region long has had shallower downturns than other parts of the U.S., due to the presence of the federal government. But he said there’s a flip side to that reality, he said. ""In a time when you start talking about a federal (government) shutdown here, federal employees quit being paid, it affects this area quite a bit,"" Clower said. We also spoke to Anirban Basu, chairman and CEO of the Sage Policy Group, a Baltimore-based economic consulting group. He said that, beyond GDP data, job creation and retail sales figures also show metro D.C. experienced a downturn during the Great Recession. Basu said there’s ""no question"" the D.C. area experiences recessions, but he echoed Clower’s sentiments that its downturns tend to be milder than the rest of the country because of the presence of the federal government and associated spending. Our ruling Huckabee said the metropolitan Washington area ""never has a recession."" Data from Moody’s Analytics show the region has had consecutive quarters of GDP retraction - a common measure of recession - three times in the past four decades. Three economists said the region has experienced downturns, albeit not as deep as most of the nation. We rate Huckabee’s claim False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809757FB40>],/factchecks/2015/oct/19/mike-huckabee/huckabee-says-dc-region-never-has-recession/

Point system means juveniles get sent home after being arrested for car theft, Milwaukee chief says
","Is it true that when juveniles get arrested for car theft in Milwaukee County, they just get sent home until their case comes up in court? That’s a claim from Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn, whose department is arresting an increasing number of juveniles for auto thefts. Appearing at a public forum at the Marquette University Law School on Aug. 27, 2015, Flynn talked about auto theft in Milwaukee, where his department has jurisdiction. He also alluded to Milwaukee County, since juveniles arrested for crimes are prosecuted in the county Children’s Court. ""If they're a juvenile, they get sent immediately home,"" Flynn stated, ""because under the point system in juvenile court, as to whether or not you're going to be held for any period of time, a stolen car counts as zero points."" As we’ll see, it’s possible for a juveniles suspected of car theft to be sent home after their arrest, but it’s not at all automatic. Scope of the problem Juveniles are a significant part of the problem in the city. According to statistics provided to us by Milwaukee police: Juveniles made up 39 percent of the suspects arrested for auto theft and auto theft-related crimes in 2014. The 363 juvenile arrests in those cases was twice as many as in 2013. Through the first nine months of 2015, there were 301 juvenile arrests in auto theft and auto-theft related cases, a slightly higher per-month clip than in 2014 Flynn’s evidence Flynn told us he didn’t have direct evidence to back his statement. In an email, his spokesman, Capt. Mark Stanmeyer, wrote: ""Chief Flynn's statement is based on information he has heard over the years from a variety of sources, both internal and external to the department, as he works to encourage the stakeholders in the juvenile prosecution, adjudication, and corrections ‘systems’ to take the issue of juvenile auto theft and general offender reform more seriously."" Per Milwaukee police policy, officers take all juveniles arrested for auto theft or operating a vehicle without the owner’s consent to the county Juvenile Justice Center, in the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa. That’s because both offenses are felonies. The first decision -- the one Flynn is referring to -- is where the juvenile should stay until making the first appearance in court. Point system In auto theft cases, the arrested juvenile is ordered to appear in Children’s Court on the next court day, said Tom Wanta, administrator of the Milwaukee County Delinquency & Court Services Division. That could be the day after the arrest, or it could be later, depending on weekends and holidays.   Staff evaluate the juvenile in order to choose from among three options on where the juvenile should be prior to the court appearance: released to go home; held in secure detention at the center; or sent to to an alternative setting, such as a temporary shelter,   To make that decision, staff use something called the Detention Risk Assessment Instrument. The DRAI uses a point system, which is what Flynn referred to in making his claim. Points are determined based on the arrest for the auto theft, but also on what are known as aggravating and mitigating factors, if there are any. Aggravating factors -- which can lead to secure detention -- include whether the facts of the auto theft are more serious than a typical case; whether the juvenile has any prior or pending criminal cases; and whether the juvenile has a documented history of violence. Mitigating factors -- which can reduce the point total and lead to release -- include whether the juvenile is stable in school, and whether a responsible adult is available to supervise the juvenile. Staff has some discretion in assigning points. Here’s a summary of how the total points are scored: Score Where juvenile suspect should be before appearing in court 0 to 9 Released home 10 to 16 Alternative location, such as a temporary shelter 17 and up Secure detention at juvenile center Auto theft is worth 10 points -- not zero, as Flynn claimed -- which initially puts a juvenile in the middle range of the scoring system. But it’s possible staff could decide to release the juvenile, with an order to appear in Children’s Court on the next court day, if mitigating factors reduce the score to 9 or lower. If there are aggravating factors that raise the score to 17 or higher, staff could decide to hold the juvenile in secure detention until the first court appearance. At the court appearance, the staff makes a recommendation to the judge on where the juvenile should be while the case is prosecuted, assuming that the district attorney’s office decides to file charges. Then the judge decides. Our rating Flynn said that in Milwaukee County, juveniles arrested for car theft ""get sent immediately home, because under the point system in juvenile court"" on holding suspects, ""a stolen car gets zero points."" It’s possible for a juvenile arrested on an auto theft-related charge to be released home until appearing in court, usually the next day. It depends on the facts of the case and factors such as whether the juvenile can be supervised by a responsible adult. But under the point system, auto theft is worth 10 points, not zero, which typically would result in the juvenile being held in secure detention or at an alternative facility until appearing in court, depending on factors such as the juvenile having a prior record. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, we rate the claim Mostly False.

Ted Cruz says GOP leadership 'took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general'
","Since his election to the U.S. Senate in 2012, Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has been a thorn in the side of fellow Republicans in the chamber for his no-compromise positions on key votes. On the Oct. 18, 2015, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Cruz, who's running for president, defended his approach to host Chuck Todd. ""What the Republican majorities have done -- we came back right after the last election, passed a trillion-dollar ‘cromnibus’ bill filled with corporate welfare,"" he said. ""Republican leadership joined with (Senate Democratic leader) Harry Reid and the Democrats to do that. Then (the Republican) leadership voted to fund Obamacare. Then they voted to fund amnesty. Then they voted to fund Planned Parenthood. And then Republican leadership took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general. Now Chuck, which one of those decisions is one iota different than what would happened under Harry Reid and the Democrats? ... They've passed more Democratic priorities than Harry Reid ever could."" We decided to take a closer look at one of the claims Cruz made -- that the ""Republican leadership took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general."" Lynch -- the designated successor to President Barack Obama’s first attorney general, Eric Holder -- was confirmed by the Senate on a 56-43 vote on April 23, 2015. Before she was elevated to the post, Cruz made his opposition clear, urging his colleagues to block her confirmation unless Obama reversed his decision to defer deportation for certain undocumented immigrants, an executive action Obama had implemented over the criticism of many Republicans in Congress. Cruz’s main point, which he made to the media at the time, was that the Republican leadership was supporting Lynch’s nomination by simply putting the confirmation vote on the calendar -- which was its responsibility given that the GOP had won back control of the chamber during the 2014 midterm elections. Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, said that because Republicans controlled the Senate during Loretta Lynch's confirmation hearings, GOP leaders had the power to stop her from becoming attorney general but did not do so. He pointed to a Politico op-ed during the confirmation fight in which Cruz wrote, ""Senate Republicans have the power to stop this nomination. And we have a choice. We can honor our oaths to the Constitution—we can defend liberty and the rule of law—or we can confirm an attorney general who has candidly admitted she will impose no limits on the President whatsoever."" What Cruz left out is that because of the efforts of GOP leaders Lynch’s path to confirmation was, by the standards of recent attorney general nominees, long and torturous. As Lynch was waiting to be confirmed, Democrats complained that the GOP majority was letting her nomination lag for a historically long time. When Obama, a few days before Lynch was finally confirmed, said that her nomination had been ""sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined,"" we rated that Mostly True. From Nov. 13, when Lynch was first nominated, until her confirmation, she saw her appointment stuck in limbo for 161 days. By comparison, the longest confirmation wait for an attorney general nominee going back to Ronald Reagan’s presidency was 30 days. The shortest was just three days. While some members of the Senate Republican Conference, including Cruz, expressed concern about Lynch’s policy views, the direct reason for Lynch’s delay was that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., insisted on passing a pending human-trafficking bill before taking up Lynch’s nomination. On the whole, the anti-trafficking bill was uncontroversial, but it had become a bone of contention between the parties due to a battle over some of its language about abortion. After weeks of stalemate, senators reached a compromise on the abortion issue and, on April 22, passed the measure by a 99-0 vote. That cleared the way for the chamber to take up Lynch’s nomination. After senators passed a procedural vote by a 66-34 margin, they took up the nomination itself and it passed, 56-43. Ten Republican senators voted in favor of Lynch’s confirmation -- Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Mark Kirk of Ililnois, Rob Portman of Ohio, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin -- and McConnell. Senate experts said this chain of events falls well short of GOP leaders ""taking the lead"" to confirm Lynch. ""McConnell acted like a conservative leader of a fairly conservative party in the Senate, getting as much as he could before grudgingly allowing the nomination to go forward,"" said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist and longtime Senate observer.   Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis and a Senate specialist, agreed that Cruz’s claim is problematic. ""It was Democrats who demanded action on the the Lynch nomination, not McConnell,"" Smith said. ""McConnell removed obstacles to the consideration of the nomination, but that is far from taking the lead or championing the effort to confirm Lynch."" A postscript: After voting against proceeding to the nomination in the preliminary vote, Cruz became the only senator who wasn’t present for the official confirmation, reportedly because he was traveling back to Texas for a fundraiser for his presidential campaign. ""The cloture vote was the vote that mattered, I voted ‘no,’ and she was confirmed because Republican leadership chose to confirm her,"" Cruz told reporters at the time. ""I disagree with that decision."" Our ruling Cruz said the Senate’s ""Republican leadership took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general."" As the leadership of the majority party in the Senate, McConnell and his lieutenants had the obligation of having the chamber hold a vote on Lynch’s nomination, and McConnell, along with several other Republicans, did personally vote for Lynch’s confirmation. However, Cruz’s claim glosses over the fact that Democrats were the driving force in pushing for a confirmation vote, and that McConnell delayed the nomination for longer than any similar nominee in recent history. This contrasts sharply with the impression Cruz leaves -- that GOP leaders were gung-ho about getting Lynch into office expeditiously. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. UPDATE, Oct. 19, 2015: After we published this story, Cruz’s staff responded to our inquiry. Their comments have been incorporated into the article.

From the other side of the Green Mountains, he could feel the spotlight. The state’s financing of the upstart video-game company, to the tune of $75 million in loan guarantees, lured 38 Studios from Massachusetts to Providence in 2010, but left Rhode Island taxpayers vulnerable in the company’s 2012 bankruptcy. Amid the torrent of new headlines about 38 Studios, Costantino, who is now commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access, issued the following statement on Sept. 27: ""My only involvement in the matter in RI was because of my former position in the RI legislature. I did not play any role in bringing the company to RI as did others in government. I was tasked with handling the legislation affecting the company by my superiors."" Costantino acknowledges he was involved with the legislation, but denies ""any role,"" compared with what ""others in government"" did, to ""bring""  Curt Schilling’s 38 Studios to Rhode Island. How can he have been both involved and not involved? Unfortunately, the former lawmaker did not respond to our request for an interview, leaving us to sort out this contradiction on our own. The freshly released emails and deposition transcripts hark back to early 2010 when Rhode Island’s courtship of 38 Studios began to get serious. The documents give the public a window into which state officials were driving the 38 Studios deal. Costantino comes across as a behind-the-scenes facilitator, helping to lay the groundwork for the public financing. The comments recorded in the depositions and other records show that Costantino: Developed the idea for guaranteeing 38 Studios’ loans.  He was the first to advocate for 38 Studios’ receipt of a $75-million state guaranteed loan, according to Keith Stokes, chairman of the R.I Economic Development Corporation at the time. And J. Michael Saul, then the EDC’s finance director, recalls that Costantino proposed the expansion of an existing loan guarantee program during a visit to 38 Studios’ headquarters in Maynard, Mass.  ""And at the conclusion of the meeting,"" Saul testified, ""he turned to me and asked me the question: If we were to increase the $50-million (loan program) to $125 million would this -- I’m paraphrasing here -- would this be helpful to get this done?""   In another email, an EDC lawyer, Robert I. Stolzman advised Carcieri’s chief of staff Andrew Hodgkin that he had sent him several documents including a draft ""authorizing the RIEDC to guarantee 38 Studios’ debt (at the suggestion of House Finance Chairman Costantino, the … draft  reflects a larger authorization for this as a Jobs Creation Guaranty Program)."" Costantino, in his deposition in 2014, did not to dispute anything in the Stolzman note.      Was among just a few lawmakers in the loop.  Only House Speaker Gordon Fox, Senate President M. Teresa Paiva-Weed, Sen. Daniel DaPonte, and Costantino knew about the 38 Studios transaction when the General Assembly approved the bill for the guarantees in 2010, according Marcel A. Valois, the EDC’s former director.    Another email from Stolzman, the EDC’s lawyer, suggests that Sharon Reynolds, the House fiscal adviser, and Costantino were privy to certain background and ""summary information"" on the ""38 Studios transaction""  before Governor Carcieri. Shielded the 38 Studios transaction from public scrutiny.  During a videotaped discussion of the bill on the House floor on April 13, one lawmaker asked about the origins of the loan guarantee legislation and who was behind it.   ""There's always conversations with lobbyists and small businesses,"" Costantino said. He didn’t name 38 Studios.    Later on in June of 2010, Costantino told Stolzman he hadn’t told a Providence Journal reporter about his visit to 38 Studios. And Costantino said he wanted to know what EDC staffers were saying about the deal. Steered the legislation for 38 Studios’ guaranteed loan.  In two separate April 2 emails with the numerals ""38"" noted in the subject line, Stokes mentions Costantino’s role in scheduling the legislation, advising others that ""Steven Costantino wants to move on it next week"" and that Costantino has advised him that House Speaker Fox wants to post the item for hearing. Our ruling In his defense, Costantino issued a statement in which he said:  ""I did not play any role in bringing the company to RI as did others in government. I was tasked with handling the legislation affecting the company by my superiors."" In other words: Don’t blame me, I was just doing my job.   But the records and comments of people involved illustrate that Costantino played a key part in Rhode Island's courtship of 38 Studios. The legislation he helped pass, offering valuable loan guarantees, was his idea, according to one former EDC official. During the process, Costantino shielded his idea from the type of full political scrutiny that might have killed it. He did this by not naming 38 Studios on the House floor when he was asked who was pushing for the loan-guarantee program. When the deal was done, the CEO of Schilling's company thanked all members of the General Assembly and singled out five elected officials by name, including the former House Finance Committee chairman. Costantino played a pivotal role in creating the 38 Studios mess. In some ways, the record shows he bears as much responsibility as the other elected government officials who ""tasked"" him. We rate his statement False.   (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)",[<zip object at 0x00000280972753C0>],/factchecks/2015/oct/18/steven-costantino/despite-his-protests-afar-costantino-played-key-ro/

Internet graphic says Bernie Sanders slammed antidepressants, but quote is actually the Unabomber's
","Ever since Bernie Sanders announced his campaign for president, journalists have been poring over his writings from late 1960s and early 1970s Vermont, some of which have raised eyebrows. As we’ve noted previously, Sanders back then wrote pieces in alternative media floating such proposals as legalizing all drugs and ending compulsory K-12 education -- positions he no longer holds. But we hadn’t heard the quote attributed to him in an Internet graphic that a reader sent our way. Superimposed over a photograph of Sanders, it said, ""Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs. In effect, antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual's internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable."" We asked the reader who sent us the image for the original source, and he sent us to a personal page on Facebook. That page alone reported more than 9,000 shares and 1,000 likes for the Sanders image. But did Sanders really say (or write) this? We took a closer look. A quick Google search provided an answer. Those words were actually written by Theodore Kaczynski. Kaczynski was arrested in 1996 and accused of sending mail bombs to universities and airlines that resulted in three deaths and 23 injuries over two decades; he pled guilty and is now serving four life sentences. Kaczynski was captured after he sent a 35,000-word ""manifesto"" to the Washington Post and the New York Times in 1995, saying he would commit another bombing unless it was published in full. On the recommendation of the attorney general and the FBI director, the Post published it as a supplement to the newspaper. Its publication is credited with breaking the case, after Kaczynski’s brother David recognized the writing style and arguments in the manifesto as his estranged brother’s and informed the authorities. Here’s a portion of the manifesto, archived on the Post’s site: ""Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs. In effect, antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual’s internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable."" The wording is identical to what’s in the graphic. To their credit, a number of commenters on the original Facebook page figured out that the quote was actually by Kaczynski. Our ruling The Internet graphic says Sanders said, ""Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs."" He didn’t -- Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, wrote that in his 1995 manifesto. Pants on Fire!

Bill O'Reilly says Austin's murder rate has spiked 83 percent
","Fox News commentator Bill O’Reilly, suggesting domestic crime is rising thanks to ""liberal compassion"" shown to convicts by President Barack Obama and others, declared that murder rates in certain cities — including Austin— are surging. Bob Cole of Austin's KOKE FM radio brought his comments to our attention. O’Reilly said on the Oct. 7, 2015, episode of ""The O’Reilly Factor"": ""The murder rate from 2014 to 15 is very instructive. ""In Washington, D.C. it's up 46 percent. ""In Milwaukee, up 68 percent. ""In St. Louis, near Ferguson, up 51 percent. In Baltimore, up 54 percent. In Denver, up 75 percent."" And, O’Reilly said, ""in Austin, Texas, the murder rate is up a whopping 83 percent."" ""Those are facts,"" he added. ""But President Obama and the left have not acknowledged them."" Nevermind O'Reilly's dart at Obama. We at PolitiFact Texas were curious about his singling out the murder rate in our headquarters city. Has Austin’s murder rate surged 83 percent? Counting killings According to an online count of Austin homicides compiled by the Austin American-Statesman, based on deaths classified as murders by the Austin Police Department, 23 people have been killed in the city since the start of 2015, compared with 37 people in all of 2014. We asked O’Reilly how he reached his Austin conclusion. Fox pointed us to a City of Austin website presenting monthly crime reports from Art Acevedo, Austin’s police chief. O’Reilly relied on Acevedo’s August 2015 report stating 22 individuals had been murdered locally from January through August 2015, compared with 12 in the comparable stretch of 2014. That’s an 83 percent increase. But we realized that calculating these year-to-year percentage changes based on monthly reports can be misleading, given the small sample size. The day after O’Reilly spoke, the Austin Police Department posted the chief’s September 2015 report tallying 23 murders through that month of the year, up from 16 in the same part of 2014, or a 44 percent increase — roughly half the percentage relayed by O’Reilly. Notably, too, if O’Reilly had spoken out about Austin’s murder rate shortly after May 2015, he could have drawn on the chief’s reports to say it had ballooned 129 percent from the year before. Cherry picking? From the chief’s reports, we tried to get a fuller sense of changes by comparing full years of data.  According to the chief’s December 2014 report, the 32 Austin murders that year exceeded the 25 murders in the city in 2013 by 28 percent. Annual APD crime reports by the department indicate there were 26 murders in the city in 2013; 33 in 2012; 27 in 2011; 38 in 2010; 22 in 2009; and 23 in 2008. We took a similar longer view of the latest count available to O’Reilly by comparing Austin murders reported by Austin’s chief for the 12 months from September 2014 through August 2015 (42) to murders reported by the chief for the previous comparable period (20), which indicated--gadzooks! -- a 100 percent-plus increase. A different longer view is possible via crime statistics collected and analyzed by the FBI, which also calculates murder rates. Austin’s estimated 2014 murder rate of 3.7 per 100,000 residents was up 22 percent from the 2013 rate of 3 murders per 100,000 residents, Austin police said in an April 2015 preliminary report based on how the FBI defines crimes. If Austin ends 2015 with 23 murders--the number reported by the chief through September 2015--the 2015 murder rate will be 2.5 murders per 100,000 residents, we estimate. Of course, that calculation unrealistically assumes Austin won’t have another murder before 2016. Still, Austin could end up with a lower murder rate in 2015 than 2014.. Austin Police Department, are local murders on a fast rise? We found another flaw with O'Reilly's methodology. Austin police Lt. Justin Newsom said caveats should be attached to the murder counts in the chief’s August 2015 report because it will be revised later. The 2014 tally has already been whittled down to remove deaths no longer classified as murders, and the 2015 count is almost certainly due to shrink. Newsom said the report’s count of 12 murders from January through August 2014 represents ""real murders"" and does not include killings not found to be murders by a grand jury or the district attorney. Conversely, Newsom said, the report’s count of 22 murders for the first eight months of 2015 folds in killings likely to be reclassified as homicides of a different variety, including, he said, six officer-involved shootings that could be deemed matters of self-defense or at the least not murders once finally reviewed by a grand jury and the district attorney. From the Statesman’s list of killings, we confirmed the six described police-involved shooting deaths, none of which had led to criminal charges at the time O’Reilly spoke. Generally, Newsom said by email, Austin homicide detectives have worked to resolve 18 murders that occurred in 2015 with all but two investigations culminating in suspects being identified, he said. If indeed 18 murders occurred from January 2015 through August 2015, that total would have been 50 percent greater than the murders tallied for the comparable part of 2014. Newsom sent us a chart showing the department’s count of murders each year from 2011 into 2015. On the chart, it looks as if there had been more murders in 2015 than through September in either of the previous two years yet fewer murders than during the comparable parts of 2011 or 2012.                SOURCE: Austin Police Department, October 2015 (received by email from Lt. Justin Newsom, Homicide Division, APD, Oct. 9, 2015) Our ruling O’Reilly said that from 2014 to 2015, Austin’s ""murder rate is up a whopping 83 percent."" There’s an element of truth here; the Austin police chief’s August 2015 report had figures indicating an 83 percent uptick in murders through that month compared to the same chunk of 2014. But the year-to-year comparison places a raw count of violent deaths in 2015 against killings confirmed as murders for the same part of 2014--generating an incomplete incorrect percentage. In contrast, if O’Reilly had pulled back the camera, so to speak, he could have determined that Austin appears on pace to have a lower murder rate in 2015 than in 2014. We rate his claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Clinton: Gun industry is 'wholly protected' from all lawsuits
","At the first Democratic debate of the 2016 presidential race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for supporting a 2005 law that shields the gun industry from certain lawsuits. Clinton voted against this law when she was a senator, and she has lambasted it several times on the campaign trail this month. ""Probably one of the most egregious, wrong, pieces of legislation that ever passed the Congress when it comes to this issue is to protect gun sellers and gun makers from liability,"" she said in Iowa Oct. 7. ""They are the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability. They can sell a gun to someone they know they shouldn't, and they won't be sued. There will be no consequences."" Is Clinton right? Are gun makers and dealers ""wholly protected"" against any kind of lawsuit, and do no other industries have similar immunities? Short answer: No. The gun industry is susceptible to some lawsuits, and there are federal laws restricting liability for a number of other types of businesses. As support, Clinton’s staff sent us a public health journal article that argues the gun industry’s ""broad immunity"" against litigation inhibits safe manufacturing and distribution of firearms, though it does not directly address her claim. Exceptions The law at issue is the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush and seen as a victory for gun rights advocates. The purpose of the law is to protect gun dealers and manufacturers from lawsuits when their products are misused. For example, if a person buys a gun legally and then uses the gun to intentionally kill someone, the gun dealer and manufacturer cannot be held liable for the crime under the law. While opponents argue that the law stops some victims from having their day in court, supporters say the law protects gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous and expensive legal proceedings. In any case, Clinton goes too far in saying the gun industry is ""wholly protected from any kind of liability."" The law lists several situations that are not protected from liability. It does not protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, nor those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued if the gun, when used properly, causes injury because the product is defective. ""The statement is incorrect insofar as it suggests that gun makers are totally free from liability,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles who specializes in gun law. Some opponents of the law argue that the liability protection is so broad and ambiguous, and the exceptions so narrow, that some legitimate lawsuits won’t have a chance to appear in court. But this is different from saying the gun industry is wholly immune to all lawsuits. Clinton also said the gun industry is the ""only"" business in America with this total liability protection. We know that it doesn’t have total protection, but do other sectors have something similar? Not the only one The act ""is not the first federal law to grant a particular industry immunity from tort liability,"" said Timothy Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University, who edited a book on gun industry litigation. Possibly the most analogous rule -- in that it protects a specific group of potential defendants from a specific liability theory -- is one that offers some immunity to online service providers, said John Goldberg, a law professor at Harvard University and an expert in tort law, in an email to PolitiFact. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act blocks victims of online defamation from suing service providers (like Comcast) and content providers (like YouTube) for failing to monitor or remove defamatory posts uploaded by customers. In a prior interview with NPR, Goldberg called the gun industry law particularly ""aggressive"" in terms of the liability protections granted. Most of the experts we surveyed also mentioned a vaccine manufacturer liability law passed in the 1980s. Under the law, victims of injuries that they say were caused by defective vaccines are not allowed to sue vaccine manufacturers. This differs from the gun legislation, however, because it established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, through which alleged victims can make a claim and receive compensation. ""By contrast, (the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act) simply prohibits certain kinds of tort claims against the gun industry without providing plaintiffs any alternative means of pursuing their claims,"" Lytton said. There’s also some liability protection in the medical devices and airline industries, noted Walter Olson, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute and expert in tort law. For example,the 1994 General Aviation Revitalization Act said small aircraft manufacturers cannot be sued for accidents involving aircraft more than 18 years old. ""It’s not at all unique to the gun industry. It’s a version (of liability law) Congress developed for an industry that was under very heavy attack,"" Olson said, referring to the slew of litigation against gun sellers and makers that prompted Congress to pass the law. Our ruling Clinton said the gun industry is ""the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability."" Clinton is talking about a law that says the gun industry is protected from liability in certain instances, but the law also specifies several situations in which the gun industry is susceptible to lawsuits. Further, Congress has passed a number of laws that protect a variety of business sectors from lawsuits in certain situations, so the situation is not unique to the gun industry. We rate Clinton’s claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096955840>],/factchecks/2015/oct/16/hillary-clinton/clinton-gun-industry-wholly-protected-all-lawsuits/
