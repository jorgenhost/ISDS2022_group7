Dick Durbin says global warming is leading to “the evaporation of our Great Lakes”
","On the same day that President Barack Obama gave a major address on climate change, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, gave a floor speech that drove the issue home for his constituents. ""I believe the environment is a challenge we must face head on,"" Durbin said on June 25, 2013. ""To ignore it is to ignore reality. Lake Michigan, when measured just a few months ago, was at its lowest depth in any measured time in recent history. What we are seeing in global warming is the evaporation of our Great Lakes."" A reader suggested we check out Durbin’s claim, so we will. The Great Lakes take in water through precipitation, runoff and inflow from upstream bodies of water; they lose it from evaporation or diversion. Both seasonal and longer-term cycles have caused fluctuations since the end of the Ice Age. Over the past 150 years, scientists say, water levels have varied within a relatively narrow, 2-meter range. But the past few decades have produced some important patterns. Lake levels were relatively high from the 1970s to the late 1990s, then fell swiftly in the late 1990s before settling in at a low, but fairly stable, level through today. Durbin is correct that water levels in Lake Michigan were lower in January 2013 than at any time since records began in 1918 -- a full 6 feet lower than the 1986 peak. This is causing worries about wildlife, shipping, recreation and tourism. Several factors tend to increase water loss: • Dredging. The removal of soil and rock to enable ships to pass can encourage lower water levels. Dredging projects going back to the 19th century are estimated to have lowered Lake Michigan by 16 inches, according to the International Joint Commission, a U.S.-Canada panel on boundary issues. • Erosion. Natural erosion since 1962 may have lowered water levels by an additional 3 to 5 inches, according to the commission. • Diversion. A diversion of Lake Michigan water to Chicago starting in 1900 is estimated to have lowered water levels by about 2 inches, but this has been more than balanced out by two diversions into Lake Superior, which feeds Lake Michigan. Dredging, erosion and diversion have affected today’s low levels by reducing the baseline level, but because there have been no major dredging projects in recent years, these factors have not contributed to recent fluctuations. Other factors more directly related to climate change, however, may have, specifically: • Low precipitation. In 2011 and 2012, the basin feeding the Great Lakes experienced mild winters, which produced lower-than-normal snowpacks, reducing a major source of incoming water in the spring. Dry summers can also provide too little incoming rain to keep levels high. • Higher evaporation. If it’s hot in the summer, water temperatures increase. Then, when cool, dry air comes in the fall, the lakes’ warmer water evaporates in greater quantities, lowering water levels. This can be exaggerated if precipitation levels are already low. Such conditions prevailed last year. • More limited ice cover. In winter, diminished ice cover can mean higher water temperatures, which in turn encourages evaporation. A 2012 study found that the Great Lakes have lost 71 percent of their ice cover since 1973. However, it gets complicated: Scientists say that greater evaporation in the fall can cool lakes, potentially increasing ice coverage the following winter. Durbin’s office pointed to these factors as support for the senator’s claim. ""Warmer weather, more severe droughts, higher water temperatures and greater evaporation are, in fact, leading to lower water levels,"" said Max Gleischman, a spokesman for Durbin. ""The lake has seen record-low water levels in recent years at the same time we’ve seen record drought conditions in the region. While temperature, water level and drought conditions have fluctuated over the years, the highs are getting higher and the lows are getting lower."" However, scientists we interviewed say Durbin’s claim is an oversimplification. ""Attribution of low lake levels to human-caused climate change is rather speculative at this time,"" said Brent M. Lofgren, a climatologist at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Lofgren said it’s important to look at the pivotal period in the late 1990s. Levels declined suddenly, he said, and since then, have remained fairly steady. The record lows of early 2013, he said, amounted to ""a small downward excursion from the levels over the last decade and a half."" In fact, after hitting the low point, Lake Michigan saw a 9-inch rise in April -- the second highest monthly increase for April on record. In other words, the water level is still low, but it’s fluctuating, and it’s in roughly the same range it’s been since the late 1990s. This pattern of events doesn’t fit very well with existing models of global warming, which suppose a gradual rise in greenhouse gases, Lofgren said. A sudden change like the one experienced in the late 1990s -- followed by a decade and a half of fairly stable levels -- ""is particularly difficult to attribute to a gradual buildup of greenhouse gases,"" he said. In the meantime, Lofgren said, the modeling of how climate change could affect the Great Lakes in the future has recently undergone a rethinking. A new model developed by Lofgren for how climate changes affect the Great Lakes basin suggests potential water-level declines smaller than previous estimates. The previous consensus for Lake Michigan was a decline of between 10 and 44 inches. The new model suggests anywhere from a decline of 36 inches to a rise of 20 inches, and another recent study indicated losses of 24 inches or less. Why such a wide range of outcomes? It boils down to complexity. Both a 2012 study by the International Joint Commission and the Great Lakes Environmental Assessment and Mapping Project, an independent group, agreed that lower water levels are likelier in the future than higher levels, but they added that varying models leave considerable uncertainty about which outcome will result. ""Although climate experts expect evaporation to increase in the future, there is debate over whether or not the Great Lakes would see more precipitation under future climate change scenarios,"" said John Allis, chief of the Great Lakes Hydraulics and Hydrology Office at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Detroit district. Our ruling Durbin pointed to recent record-low water levels in Lake Michigan as evidence that global warming is leading to ""the evaporation of our Great Lakes."" Most scientists agree that recent patterns of precipitation, evaporation and ice cover suggest that climate change is affecting water levels in the Great Lakes. But over the long term, dredging and erosion have lowered water levels, and the sudden decline in the late 1990s, followed by a relatively stable decade and a half, doesn’t mesh with the presumed slow buildup of greenhouse gases. In addition, scientific models offer a wide range of possible impacts on water levels due to climate change, from decreases to increases. Because Durbin’s statement is oversimplified and ignores complicating factors, we rate it Half True.","[('Dick Durbin, Senate floor speech, June 25, 2013', 'https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-06-25/pdf/CREC-2013-06-25-pt1-PgS5105-3.pdf#page=1'), ('WLS, ""Durbin: Global warming is evaporating Lake Michigan,"" June 26, 2013', 'No link'), ('U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration, ""Status of the U.S.-Flag Great Lakes Water Transportation Industry,"" February 2013', 'http://www.wlsam.com/common/page.php?pt=Durbin%3A+Global+warming+is+evaporating+Lake+Michigan&id=49583&is_corp=0'), ('International Joint Commission, ""What Factors Affect Great Lakes Water Levels,"" 2013', 'No link'), ('U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Detroit District, water level homepage, accessed June 27, 2013', 'http://www.marad.dot.gov/documents/US-Flag_Great_Lakes_Water_Transportation_Industry_Final_Report_2013.pdf'), ('U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ""Great Lakes Water Levels,"" accessed June 27, 2013', 'No link'), ('Indiana Department of Natural Resources, ""Lake Level Fluctuations,"" accessed June 27, 2013', 'https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/717945-ijc-water-levels-1.html'), ('Jia Wang et al, ""Temporal and Spatial Variability of Great Lakes Ice Cover, 1973–2010"" (Journal of Climate), February 2012', 'No link'), ('National Geographic News Watch, ""Warming Lakes: Climate Change and Variability Drive Low Water Levels on the Great Lakes,"" Nov. 20, 2012', 'http://www.lre.usace.army.mil/Missions/GreatLakesInformation/GreatLakesWaterLevels/CurrentConditions.aspx'), ('Great Lakes Environmental Assessment and Mapping Project, ""Changing water levels,"" accessed June 27, 2013', 'No link'), ('mlive.com, ""Great Lakes water levels: Is water pulled out at Chicago the cause of low water levels?""

Carter: Baptist group diminishes roles of women
","
Former President Jimmy Carter recently gave a striking example of what he says is one particular way women are ill-treated by an influential group in this country. 
""As you may or may not know, the Southern Baptist Convention back now about 13 years ago in Orlando, voted that women were inferior and had to be subservient to their husbands, and ordained that a woman could not be a deacon or a pastor or a chaplain or even a teacher in a classroom in some seminaries where men are in the classroom, boys are in the classroom,"" Carter said in an interview with Time magazine. ""So my wife and I withdrew from the Southern Baptist Convention primarily because of that."" 
News accounts and the organization’s website confirm the SBC’s belief that only men can be pastors. What was less clear to us was whether the organization ""voted that women were inferior and had to be subservient to their husbands."" PolitiFact Georgia decided to do some research. 
Carter, a Democrat, gave the interview in advance of the Mobilizing Faith for Women conference, which was scheduled from June 27 to 29 at his presidential center in Atlanta. The conference is aimed at improving the lives of women around the world. The Carter Center’s website says prior conferences have helped combat issues such as human trafficking and sexual violence. Carter, a former Georgia governor, is listed as a speaker. 
The Southern Baptist Convention, which organized in Augusta in 1845, claims nearly 16 million members from more than 45,000 churches. It believes in the basic tenets of Christianity, supports mission work worldwide and has claimed some of the nation’s most powerful political leaders among its membership. Former President Bill Clinton grew up as a Southern Baptist. 
Carter spokeswoman Deanna Congileo said the former president based his comments on a resolution concerning the family structure that the Southern Baptists passed in 1998. The four-paragraph statement, Article XVIII, aims to define the roles of men and women in marriage. 
The most pertinent portion of the section, the third paragraph, reads: 
""The husband and wife are of equal worth before God, since both are created in God's image. The marriage relationship models the way God relates to His people. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church. He has the God-given responsibility to provide for, to protect, and to lead his family. A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ. She, being in the image of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, has the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next generation."" 
The section was based, in part, on Ephesians 5:21-24, which is in the New Testament. Verses 22-24 of the New International Version of the Bible say: ""Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything."" 
Southern Baptist leaders said the article was written to encourage Americans to seek traditional family values in response to rising divorce rates, children born out of wedlock and violence by children against their parents. The language about women made national news. Some activists and others were outraged at what they deemed sexist language by the Southern Baptist Convention. Others, including many Christian women, said they agreed with the Southern Baptist resolution, The Chicago Tribune reported in 1998. 
""It doesn't mean that the husband gets the last say every time,"" Susan Robinson, a secretary at Riverside Baptist Church in Denver, told the Tribune. ""It's spiritual leadership."" 
Carter, who announced he was leaving the Southern Baptist Convention in 2000, was quoted in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution at the time as saying Southern Baptist leaders were taking biblical passages out of context. 
""President Carter interprets the word ‘submit’ as placing women in an inferior position. (Submissive and subservient are synonyms.),"" Congileo told us via email. 
Webster’s list of synonyms for submissive include amenable, compliant, docile and obedient. 
Congileo said she had no further comment to our follow-up questions concerning Article XVIII’s use of the word ""equal"" in the resolution. 
To sum up, Carter claimed the Southern Baptist Convention voted in favor of a resolution that women were inferior and had to be subservient to their husbands. Carter is wrong on the ""inferior"" portion of his statement. The resolution says wives are of equal value before God. 
Carter gets closer on his ""subservient"" claim. The former president interprets the line in the resolution about wives submitting themselves to the ""servant leadership"" of their husbands as tantamount to wives being subservient. That is certainly open to interpretation, given the definition of ""servant leadership"" (one who ""serves"" the people he/she ""leads""). 
Carter has a case if you cherry-pick the document. But the former president begins sliding down the Truth-O-Meter if you look at Article XVIII and its possible interpretations. 
Overall his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. 
That meets PolitiFact’s definition of Mostly False.","[('\nTime, ""Jimmy Carter: A Sunday Interview,"" June 23, 2013.', 'http://swampland.time.com/2013/06/23/jimmy-carter-a-sunday-interview/'), ('\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution Political Insider blog, ""Jimmy Carter says ban on ordination of women are green lights for discrimination,"" June 24, 2013.', 'No link'), ('\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution, ""Carter cuts ties to ‘rigid’ Southern Baptists,"" Oct. 20, 2000', 'https://www.ajc.com/weblogs/political-insider/2013/jun/24/your-daily-jolt-jimmy-carter-says-bans-ordination-/'), ('\nChicago Tribune, ""Southern Baptists Approve Submissive Wives Doctrine,"" June 10, 1998.', 'No link'), ('\nEmail from Deanna Congileo, spokeswoman, former President Jimmy Carter, June 26, 2013', 'http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-06-10/news/9806100212_1_baptist-faith-and-message-rev-paige-patterson-denomination'), ('\nSouthern Baptist Convention, ""The Baptist Faith and Message.""', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2013/jun/28/jimmy-carter/carter-baptist-group-diminishes-roles-women/

Wisconsin's new private school tax break most generous in U.S., state schools superintendent says
","
When it comes to taxpayer support of private schools in Wisconsin, most of the controversy over the 2013-’15 state budget centered on a limited expansion of the voucher program. 
But what could really set Wisconsin apart is a lesser known provision of the budget, which Gov. Scott Walker plans to sign into law on June 30, 2013. 
The provision would give parents, regardless of income, a state income tax deduction of up to $10,000 for sending a child to private school. 
The measure drew the ire of state schools superintendent Tony Evers, who voiced his objections on the June 23, 2013 edition of ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" which airs on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee. 
""The Legislature expanded the vouchers across the state of Wisconsin. Now they’ve doubled down and decided, well, we’re going to give a tax break to parents that send their kids to private and parochial schools. And it’s going to cost $30 million in one year, and, of course, the next biennium it will be at least double of that,"" Evers said in the web-only portion of the show. 
""So, it's taking money out of the system that would normally go to public schools -- and it's the most generous in the nation. If you and I were billionaires and were sending our kids to high-tuition high schools, we would get, as billionaires, get the tax credits for that. It's obviously not progressive and it's going to hurt our public schools."" 
There are plenty of opinions on both sides over the merits of a private school tax break. 
But would Wisconsin’s tax break be the most generous in the nation? 
The proposal 
In refashioning Walker’s initial budget proposal, the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee voted June 5, 2013 to add the tax deduction. As Evers indicated, taxpayers would pay $30 million per year less in income taxes. 
Parents of the nearly 100,000 students in private schools could get an income tax deduction of up to $4,000 for tuition paid for each kindergarten through eighth-grade student and up to $10,000 for each high school student. 
For a typical family, according to a rough calculation by the Legislature's nonpartisan budget office, the deduction would result in a tax cut of $240 for each kindergarten through eighth-grade student and $600 for each high school student. 
Evers’ evidence 
To back Evers' claim, Evers spokesman John Johnson cited a June 2013 article in Governing magazine. 
The article cited the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, an education reform think tank, in saying that only a handful of states offer tax breaks for private school. Those tax breaks, the Governing article stated, are ""much less generous"" than Wisconsin’s plan. 
We asked the Fordham Institute’s school choice analyst, Adam Emerson, about that. He said Wisconsin's $10,000 maximum is higher than any other state's. But he referred us to the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, a conservative organization founded by the late Milton Friedman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, for more details. 
The Wisconsin Budget Project also based its analysis of the Wisconsin tax break on Friedman Foundation figures. 
The figures include apples and oranges. Some states, like Wisconsin, offer a tax deduction, which reduces the amount of income you pay taxes on; but others offer a credit, which reduces the amount of taxes you owe. 
Here’s a summary: 
State 
Income limit to qualify for tax credit or deduction 
Maximum tax credit or deduction 
Illinois 
None 
Credit: $500/family 
Indiana 
None 
Deduction: $1,000/child 
Iowa 
None 
Credit: $250/child 
Louisiana 
None 
Deduction: $5,000/child 
Minnesota* 
None/$37,500 
$2,500/$1,000 
Wisconsin 
None 
Deduction: $4,000/child for K-8; $10,000 for high school 
*There is no income limit to qualify for Minnesota’s tax deduction, which is up to $1,625 per child in grades K-6 and $2,500 per child in grades 7-12. But for its tax credit, which is worth a maximum of $1,000, there is an income limit of $37,500 for one child (and the limit goes up for more children). 
(Alabama also offers a tax credit, up to $3,500 per student, but it’s available only to students who transfer to a private school from a ""failing"" public school. And North Carolina offers a credit of up to $6,000 per student, but only for students with disabilities.) 
What’s clear from the chart is Wisconsin’s maximum deduction -- $10,000 for a student attending a private high school -- far exceeds the deductions in other states. However, Louisiana's $5,000 maximum deduction for students in kindergarten through eighth grade exceeds Wisconsin's $4,000 deduction. 
We wondered about the states offering tax credits. The Friedman Foundation ran some more data. 
Wisconsin’s $10,000 maximum tax deduction would result in a maximum tax cut, for families with incomes above $155,000, of $775. 
That's higher than the maximum credits offered by Illinois and Iowa, but less than Minnesota’s maximum credit of $1,000. 
However, there's no income limit for claiming the Wisconsin tax deduction, whereas Minnesota's credit is only for people earning less than $37,500. Moreover, Minnesota's credit applies only to education expenses other than tuition; Wisconsin's deduction applies to tuition which, of course, is the largest private school expense. 
All of which makes the point that, depending on a family's income, the number and ages of their children, and the income tax rates in their state, the benefit to them of a state’s private school tax break can vary widely. 
Our rating 
Evers said a private school tax break in the Wisconsin state budget would be ""the most generous in the nation."" 
It's among the most generous -- for parents with multiple children attending a private high school, for example. But depending on various factors, it's not necessarily more generous than other states.

Senate bill has immediate legalization but border security that's 'designed never to come into being,' says Cruz
","
A 1986 immigration law signed by President Ronald Reagan casts a long shadow over the current immigration reform debate. Opponents of today’s immigration bill say that law gave away the farm -- it granted amnesty and failed to button down the border -- and they don’t want to see history repeat itself. 
This was the main argument from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in a Fox News interview. On  the day a key amendment passed a crucial Senate vote, Cruz warned that the bill ""has immediate legalization ... and the border security is sometime in the future, and just like in 1986, it's designed never to come into being."" 
Cruz and the Senate Republican leadership say the border must be able to keep people out before those who are here without documents are given any path to legal status. To do otherwise, they argue, would only invite a flood of unauthorized immigration. 
We’ll examine both parts of Cruz’s statement. Does legalization come before the border is secure? And is border security treated as it was in the 1986 law and ""designed to never come to pass""? 
Defining legalization 
The matter of when legalization happens is relatively easy to resolve, although we found two different meanings to the word. For some, such as Cruz, it means any formal status that allows a person to stay and work in the U.S., even temporarily. For others, it means permanent legal residency, often referred to as a green card. 
The Senate bill, grants what it calls ""registered provisional immigrant"" status, or RPI. This is not a green card granting permanent legal status; but it does mean a person has passed a criminal record check, paid a fine, and met other requirements. With provisional status, a person can stay and work for at least six years. However, under an amendment crafted by John Hoeven, R-N.D., and Bob Corker, R- Tenn., no one can apply for that until the Department of Homeland Security puts together and launches a border control plan (formally called the Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy and the Southern Border Fencing Strategy). There’s also a similar status for agricultural workers called a blue card. 
Is either status legalization? Cruz would certainly say yes. More important, so does the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the analytic arm of Congress. The CBO’s assessment of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, the bill’s formal title, tallies the number of people expected to qualify under the new rules. In one table, it lists legalization programs and under that are the provisional status (RPI) and the blue card. 
We checked with the CBO and there is no mistake. The provisional status and the blue card are legalization in the eyes of the CBO. We also contacted the Migration Policy Institute, a group that studies population movements worldwide. The institute defines legalization the same way as the CBO. Supporters of immigration reform often focus on the rules and timing for getting a green card and consider that to be legalization, but the CBO definition carries great weight in this debate. 
Getting back to the bill, a border security plan must be underway before people can begin to apply, but that security plan need not be completed. The CBO estimates the application process wouldn’t begin until sometime in fiscal year 2015, but it would come before all border tightening measures are in place. 
Hardening the border 
If Cruz had stopped with legalization, he would have been on more solid ground, but he went further and said the Senate bill neglects border security. He said it was like the 1986 reform act, and he went so far as to say it was ""designed"" to lead to nowhere. 
We asked Cruz’s office for specific supporting evidence. Spokeswoman Catherine Frazier noted several deficiencies in the Hoeven-Corker amendment, including that it fails to require a biometric system -- such as a retina scan -- for monitoring people as they enter and leave the country. But even more fundamental is the timing in the legislation. 
""The border security assets required by the amendment have to be in place 10 years in the future before illegal immigrants can obtain green cards,"" Frazier said. ""Meaning border security does not have to happen if an administration does not care about giving them green cards… and just leaving them as RPIs in perpetuity. 
""There is no guarantee in this bill that the border will ever be secured, so we essentially have a bill that offers legalization and little else."" Frazier said. 
The CBO analyzed the Hoeven-Corker amendment, which has become the latest version of the bill. The report said, ""The proposed amendment would appropriate $46.3 billion for expenses related to the security of the southern U.S. border and initial administrative costs."" About $30 billion would go to hire at least 19,200 additional border patrol agents; close to $8 billion would go to building a fence along the border. 
There is an important verb in that sentence from the CBO. It is ""appropriate."" Congress controls the purse strings on government spending. The smallest step it can take is to authorize money. Authorized dollars mean little until Congress takes the real step and appropriates the money. Appropriations, on the other hand, are actual dollars that are there for an agency to spend. 
The Senate bill appropriates over $46 billion to beef up border security. The time frame for most of the spending is 2014 to 2018. 
Cruz said this is ""just like 1986."" We looked at the 1986 Immigration Control and Reform Act. When it comes to border security, it only authorized spending. The current bill both authorizes and actually appropriates spending for border security. It sets aside a designated pot of money -- the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Trust Fund -- and it puts $46.3 billion into it by Oct. 1, 2013. 
Taking note of the sequence of events, if the bill becomes law, the agencies start spending money on agents and other measures immediately. 
The bill sets many goals for border enforcement. Beyond the new patrol agents, it adds 350 miles of fencing and creates an entry/exit system to track not just when people enter the country but when they leave. It requires all employers to use an employment verification system. 
Our ruling 
Cruz said the Senate immigration bill offers immediate legalization of unauthorized immigrants and that it indefinitely defers action on border security. Cruz said this bill was just like the major reform bill in 1986. 
On legalization, the process would not be immediate, but as the CBO uses the term, it would come before the border is fully secured. Proponents of the bill refer to this as ""provisional"" status. By and large, immigrants could not apply to receive permanent legalized status until border security meets certain benchmarks. 
The Senate measure also appropriates more than $46 billion for border security and makes that money available immediately. So Cruz is wrong to say the security measures are designed ""never to come into being."" 
Cruz was reasonably accurate on legalization but was way off the mark on the bill’s border security being ""designed never to come into being."" We rate his statement Mostly False.

Sen. Jeff Sessions says immigration bill has provision that lets Janet Napolitano skip fence
","
Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., says he opposes an immigration bill working its way through the Senate because it offers ""a mere promise of enforcement in the future."" 
For example, the bill’s promised 700 miles of border fencing — it just isn’t going to happen, he argues. 
He told Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer on June 23, 2013, that even with a security-boosting amendment from Republican Sens. Bob Corker and John Hoeven, the bill ""doesn’t fulfill its promises."" 
""It has a specific provision that says that Secretary (Janet) Napolitano does not have to build any fence if she chooses not to,"" Sessions said. 
Senators are expected to vote on the amended bill this week. Does it give Napolitano a choice about how much fencing to build — including none? 
‘No fewer than 700 miles’ 
The border fence is one of five so-called ""triggers"" that must be in place before most immigrants who get provisional status under the law are eligible for permanent residency. 
The bill requires a ""Southern Border Fencing Strategy"" to be submitted to Congress — and implemented — with certification from the Homeland Security secretary ""that there is in place along the Southern Border no fewer than 700 miles of pedestrian fencing."" 
There are right now 350 miles of such fencing. The law requires that to be doubled for provisional residents to change status. So: No fence, no path to citizenship. 
But Sessions’ press secretary, Jack Bonnikson, told us that there’s ""an opt-out provision"" that allows the secretary to avoid fence-building. It’s in a different section of the bill. 
Here’s what it says: 
""Notwithstanding paragraph (1), nothing in this subsection shall require the Secretary to install fencing, or infrastructure that directly results from the installation of such fencing, in a particular location along the Southern border, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain effective control over the Southern border at such location."" 
The ""notwithstanding"" language trumps other language in the bill, Bonnikson said, giving Napolitano the freedom to decide that no fence is the best option, no matter what the trigger says. 
Now, we’re not attorneys. So we talked to a few. 
They said the ""notwithstanding"" language (which means ""in spite of"")  isn’t nearly as broad as Bonnikson suggests. The provision mentions a particular paragraph and subsection of the bill, neither of which are anywhere near the trigger that requires 700 miles of fencing. 
Meanwhile, the provision very specifically addresses not the amount of fencing, but its location. Since the southern border is nearly 2,000 miles long, there will be plenty of choices to make. 
So, while we can’t say for certain a judge wouldn’t take liberties interpreting the language of the legislation, on its face, what Sessions’ office calls an ""opt-out"" provision just offers the administration considerable choice about where to put fencing — not whether to build it. 
""This provision just gives DHS discretion not to build a fence at a particular location, not discretion to not build a fence at all,"" said Stephen Yale-Loer, an immigration attorney who teaches at Cornell Law. 
Sen. Corker offers the same explanation on his website. 
Meanwhile, at least one pro-immigrant group has withdrawn its support for the bill because of its focus on ""militarization of the border."" 
Our ruling 
Sessions said the immigration bill ""has a specific provision that says that Secretary Napolitano does not have to build any fence if she chooses not to."" His press secretary pointed to an ""opt-out"" provision in the bill. 
But it would take a dramatic leap of legal interpretation to argue that provision allows Napolitano to skip fence-building altogether. Legal experts we spoke to said, instead, it gives her discretion about where to build border fencing.

"['Abortion', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Texas', 'Jerry Patterson']","
Jerry Patterson says the majority of Texans support failed abortion legislation
","A Republican official declared that abortion legislation that perished amid shouting from the Texas Senate gallery was nevertheless popular across Texas.

After a special legislative session ended without Senate Bill 5 advancing from the Texas Senate to Gov. Rick Perry, Jerry Patterson said in an email blast: ""Late last night, a bill supported by a majority of the Texas Legislature and a majority of Texans, was shouted down by a rude, unruly mob who decided that the legislative process is only worthwhile when it produces something they support.""

Patterson, the state land commissioner, sent the June 26, 2013, blast on behalf of his 2014 campaign for lieutenant governor. Other expected candidates include the incumbent, David Dewhurst, and Todd Staples, the state agriculture commissioner, both Republicans.

In the email, Patterson followed up his reference to the legislation’s popularity by suggesting the current lieutenant governor, who typically presides over the Senate, deserves blame for the ""breakdown of decorum and procedure.""

That’s an opinion; we focused the Truth-O-Meter on whether the legislation, which was backed by a majority of the Republican-dominated Legislature, had the support of a majority of Texans.

As summarized in a June 24, 2013, Associated Press news article, the measure would require all abortions to take place in surgical centers, facilities designed to cope with major surgeries that could lead to life-threatening complications. As it stands, the story said, the majority of abortions are not surgical procedures, and 37 of the state's 42 abortion clinics do not meet the intended standard.

The bill also would require abortion doctors to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where they work, the AP said. Finally, the proposal as amended by the Texas House would restrict abortions after 20 weeks, shaving four weeks off current law.

By email, Patterson told us that a recent poll by the University of Texas/Texas Tribune showed 62 percent of Texans supporting or strongly supporting the prospect of limiting abortions that occur after the 20th week of pregnancy.

According to a June 20, 2013, Tribune news article on the poll, 62 percent said they would support ""prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks."" The poll, taken from May 30, 2013, through June 13, 2013, with help from California-based YouGov, sampled 1,200 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percent.

The Tribune reported that nearly half — 47 percent — said they would strongly support those prohibition. Its article continued: ""It’s a strongly partisan issue, however, with 85 percent of Republicans in favor of the ban and nearly half of the Democrats against it. Fewer than 10 percent of Republicans oppose the 20-week ban; fewer than two in five Democrats support it.""

More broadly, the Tribune said, the poll indicated a general divide on abortion that it described as evident in past polls. ""Some 46 percent of Texas voters say it should never be permitted or permitted only in cases involving incest, rape or when the woman's life is in danger,"" the article said, while ""49 percent say it should be allowed after the need for an abortion has been clearly established, or that the choice should be completely left to the woman. Within those numbers, 16 percent said abortion should never be allowed, and 36 percent said that a woman should always be able to get an abortion as a matter of personal choice.""

By telephone, UT’s Jim Henson, the poll’s co-director, said the poll did not ask respondents directly about the proposal that ultimately fell short of final approval in the Senate. Nor, Henson said, were there questions touching on the bill’s provisions for abortion clinics to meet surgical hospital standards and for each provider physician to have admission privileges at a nearby hospital.

""There was a lot more in that bill than the 20-week ban,"" Henson said.

We searched for other recent polls of Texans about abortion or the legislation, finding only a survey by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a Washington-based firm whose leaders include Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg.

In the poll of 601 registered voters, some 52 percent said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, the firm said in a June 20, 2013, summary, with 39 percent saying it should be illegal in most or all cases. The survey, taken June 17-19, 2013, had an overall margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

And the poll included a query about whether respondents would favor or oppose a proposal described as introduced by Perry and under consideration in the special session. The survey said: ""This proposal would put in place new restrictions and regulations on abortion providers that would likely result in the closure of all but five abortion clinics in the state of Texas, all of which are located along the I-35 corridor, and would ban most abortions starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy."" In response, 42 percent somewhat or strongly favored the proposal with 51 percent somewhat or strongly opposing it, the firm said, while 7 percent did not know or did not respond.

We noticed, though, that the question was preceded by inquiries arguably intended to stir respondents' concerns. For instance, the poll's first opinion question spoke to whether respondents thought women’s access to health care is ""being threatened in Texas."" The next query asked if the special session should focus on issues like education, jobs and the economy ""instead of bringing up social issues like abortion that were already addressed"" in the 2013 regular session. Farther along, the questions immediately before the one about the abortion proposal asked if the person trusted or didn’t trust Perry and the Legislature to ""make decisions"" about women’s health care; 57 percent said not.

By email and telephone, Patterson told us he has seen no poll of Texans on anything but the 20-week provision.

""The pro-choice folks focus solely on the ‘access’ issue,"" Patterson said, referring to criticism that the stepped-up medical standards will lead to clinics closing. But, he said, the 20-weeks’ provision became the most salient part of the legislation after it was restored to the measure in the House. ""Ask anyone you know if they're ‘comfortable’ with abortions after 20 weeks,"" he said.

He later added that a majority of voters might favor the measure’s required hospital standards. ""But that’s conjecture,"" he said.

Our ruling

Patterson said the majority of Texans supported the abortion measure that died.

Yet he did not offer nor did we find public polls covering every element of the legislation, though the GQR poll stretched to two elements of the legislation, seemingly finding a majority of Texans in opposition--though the poll struck us as laden with phrasing likely to encourage qualms about anti-abortion measures.

Patterson’s statement has an element of truth in that 62 percent of respondents in the UT/Texas Tribune poll specifically supported barring abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which the proposal angled to do.

But the lack of other backup evidence leaves the overall claim Mostly False.","[('News article, ""Texas Republicans on verge of passing abortion law,"" Associated Press, June 24, 2013', 'http://www.mystatesman.com/news/ap/legislative/texas-lawmakers-debate-abortion-restrictions/nYSkk/'), ('Emails and telephone interviews, Jerry Patterson, Texas land commissioner, June 26, 2013', 'No link'), ('News article, ""UT/TT Poll: Texans Split on Permissibility of Abortions,"" the Texas Tribune, June 20, 2013', 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zo0oUO62KrGTjKZD3-T1OrUmEQFkC8l7z3226cQYvzk/pub'), ('Telephone interview, Jim Henson, director, Texas Politics Project, Department of Government, University of Texas, co-director, UT/Texas Tribune poll, Austin, June 26, 2013', 'No link'), ('Press release, ""Texas Voters Oppose Governor Perry\'s Omnibus Abortion Bill,"" June 20, 2013, Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, Washington, D.C.

Ohio Sen. Kris Jordan says Delaware County lays claim to most waterfront property in the state
","
Ohio’s northern shore along Lake Erie provides a coastal connection to the Great Lakes, a series of inland seas that collectively hold the greatest supply of freshwater in the world. 
So it got PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity going when we heard a claim that state Sen. Kris Jordan, a Republican from Delaware County, made during budget debates in the Ohio Senate. 
""Delaware County actually has more lakefront property and waterfront property than any other county in the state of Ohio,"" Jordan said. 
PolitiFact Ohio decided to see if Jordan’s claim held water. 
After all, Ohio’s north shore stretches hundreds of miles through eight different counties.  Delaware County, meanwhile, is landlocked in the center of the state. 
First, let’s put Jordan’s remark in context. 
The senator made his claim while speaking in support of some provisions in the budget bill that targeted the city of Columbus. 
Columbus maintains a buffer strip around two reservoirs that extend into Delaware County, and Jordan’s district, and supply water to the city. Adjacent property owners have, in the past, clashed with the city over use of the buffer strips. Some, for example, have been cited for mowing grasses that the city says help with filtration of runoff water that enters the reservoir. 
The budget bill included restrictions to bar the city from penalizing property owners for doing what Jordan described as ""basic maintenance of their property."" He urged they be left in the legislation. 
Those reservoirs are part of the reason Delaware County has the most shoreline, Jordan said. 
PolitiFact Ohio checked with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to see what data it could provide. 
It has a website link with information about the Lake Erie shoreline that includes mileage for each of eight counties -- Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Erie, Lake, Lorain, Lucas, Ottawa and Sandusky. 
Ottawa County, which includes most of the Lake Erie islands, has the most lakefront property among those eight, with total shoreline of 94 miles. Next was Erie County with 68 miles. Sandusky County had the least among the eight with just 13 miles of lakeshore. 
But Ottawa’s shoreline wasn’t nearly the greatest in Ohio. 
ODNR experts from the Division of Coastal Management and Division of Soil and Water Resources used data from geographic information systems to calculate shorelines for Ohio’s other counties, coming up with estimates that took into account waterfront along inland lakes and waterways. 
Ottawa cracked the top five at No. 4. The others in the top five are inland counties that are home to large lakes or reservoirs. 
And Delaware was indeed No. 1. It has about 140 miles of shoreline, according to ODNR. 
Delaware County is home to O’Shaughnessy and Hoover reservoirs, two large man-made lakes that are a key part of Columbus’ water supply. 
Alum Creek Lake and Delaware Lake, two other man-made bodies of water, also are in Delaware County. Each is home to a state park. 
Jordan’s claim was that Delaware County had more waterfront property than any other in the state of Ohio. ODNR’s experts, using computer data to prepare the estimates, would agree. 
On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates True.","[('\nThe Ohio Channel, ""Senate Session - June 6, 2013 - Part 3""', 'http://www.ohiochannel.org/MediaLibrary/Media.aspx?fileId=139266'), ('\nEmail exchange with Mark Bruce, public information officer, Ohio Department of Natural Resources, June 14, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nCity of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities, ""Water Supply and Source Management History""', 'http://publicutilities.columbus.gov/content.aspx?id=16077'), ('\nCity of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities, ""Watershed Management Program""', 'No link'), ('\nOhio Department of Natural Resources, Alum Creek State Park', 'http://publicutilities.columbus.gov/content.aspx?id=36978'), ('\nOhio Department of Natural Resources, Delaware State Park', 'No link'), ('\nOhio Department of Natural Resources, ""Explore Ohio’s 312-mile shore,"" Ohio’s Lake Erie Public Access Guide', 'http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/parks/alum/tabid/711/Default.aspx')]",/factchecks/2013/jun/27/kris-jordan/ohio-sen-kris-jordan-says-delaware-county-lays-cla/

Barack Obama says when he went to college in Los Angeles, the pollution was often so bad that 'folks couldn't go outside'
","
When President Barack Obama gave a major address on climate change on June 25, 2013, he reached back more than three decades for a personal anecdote to support his argument. 
""Now, what you'll hear from the special interests and their allies in Congress is that (my climate change plan) will kill jobs and crush the economy and basically end American free-enterprise as we know it,"" Obama said. ""And the reason I know you'll hear those things is because that's what they said every time America sets clear rules and better standards for our air and our water and our children's health. 
""And every time they've been wrong,"" Obama continued. ""when I was going to school in 1979, 1980 in Los Angeles, there were days where folks couldn't go outside -- and the sunsets were spectacular -- because of all the pollution in the air. 
""At the time when we passed the Clean Air Act, to try to get rid of some of this smog, some of the same doomsayers were saying, ‘New pollution standards will decimate the auto industry.’ Guess what? It didn't happen. Our air got cleaner."" 
Many Twitter users asked us whether it was really true that during Obama’s days in Los Angeles ""there were days where folks couldn't go outside. … because of all the pollution in the air."" 
We’ll start with some background on smog. The smog predominant in Los Angeles -- formally known as ""photochemical smog"" -- is created when light reacts with motor vehicle and industrial emissions to form ground-level ozone. This ozone can make it difficult to breathe, causing asthma attacks and lung inflammation, as well as making eyes itchy and watery. 
In the United States, at least, Los Angeles has been ground zero for smog for decades, due to its heavy automobile usage, its industrial base and the presence of mountains and valleys, which prevent polluted air from floating elsewhere. Los Angeles smog emerged in the 1940s and worsened from the 1950s to the 1970s. It got so bad in October 1954 that the city virtually shut down for the entire month (and gas masks were common, as the photograph below illustrates). Smog became so closely identified with Los Angeles that ""smog in a can"" became a popular gag gift. 
Today, Los Angeles still has smog -- in April 2013, the American Lung Association ranked L.A. first in the nation for ozone pollution, as well as fourth for particulate pollution such as dust and soot. But concerted environmental efforts have reduced the extent of the problem significantly. 
In rising order of seriousness, smog alerts for southern California start with health advisories and move upwards to stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3. The last stage 3 smog alert came in 1974 -- so long ago that Ronald Reagan was still governor. The last stage 2 alert came in 1988, and there has been only one stage 1 alert since 1998 (it came in 2003). 
""Peak ozone levels in southern California today are roughly one-third of what they were in the late 1970s, due to aggressive and innovative air pollution controls here,"" said Sam Atwood, a spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the air-pollution control agency for Los Angeles, Orange County and portions of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
So what would Obama have experienced when he was a student at Occidental, the college he attended before transferring to Columbia University for his junior and senior year? We can approximate the impact based on statistical and anecdotal evidence. 
Occidental, located in the Eagle Rock neighborhood northeast of downtown L.A., would have been subject to many of the smog risks typical of the region from 1979 to 1981. 
According to South Coast Air Quality Management District data, a health advisory -- a comparatively low-level alert -- was issued somewhere in the agency’s region of jurisdiction 169 times in 1979, 152 times in 1980 and 159 times in 1981. The stage 1 threshold was met 120, 101, and 99 times during those three years. 
Even allowing that Occidental itself may have experienced just a fraction of these episodes, the university still would have faced a significant number. 
So what did these advisories mean in a practical sense? For a health advisory, the lowest of these levels, all children are supposed to ""discontinue prolonged, vigorous outdoor exercise lasting longer than one hour,"" and ""susceptible persons, such as those with heart or lung disease"" should ""avoid outdoor activity,"" including ""calisthenics, basketball, running, soccer, football, tennis, swimming laps, and water polo."" 
For the more severe stage 1 episodes, all children are supposed to ""discontinue all vigorous outdoor activities regardless of duration,"" including ""physical education classes, sports practices, and athletic competitions."" 
Finally, for stage 2 or stage 3, all children are supposed to ""discontinue all outdoor activities."" 
This suggests that Obama’s claim is slightly exaggerated. He said that ""there were days where folks couldn't go outside,"" but nothing in the rules addressed what healthy adults could do, including healthy college-age kids. Rather, the rules addressed adults with compromised health as well as children. 
Still, the reality of smog alerts was not pretty, and by all accounts, staying inside, if feasible, was certainly preferable. 
The White House pointed us to a Newsweek article from Sept. 24, 1979, when Obama was just settling in at Occidental, that documents what it called the worst L.A. smog in 24 years. ""Tennis courts stood empty,"" the article said. ""Golf courses lay nearly deserted. Schools canceled recess, and the usual parade of joggers around Pasadena's Rose Bowl dwindled to just a handful."" 
We found other first-hand testimony. Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College in the Los Angeles suburb of Claremont, recalls enduring smog alerts when he was a student at neighboring Pitzer College in the mid 1970s. ""There were way too many days when you could not see the mountain that today frames my office window,"" he said. ""It was possible to not know it was there for months at a time."" 
And William Kelly, the co-author of Smogtown: The Lung-Burning History of Pollution in Los Angeles, recalls attending Occidental a few years before Obama. 
""When I got there in 1973, I played a vigorous game of basketball in an un-air-conditioned gym,"" Kelly said. ""I don't remember the end of the game, just waking up in the early evening with a pounding headache and watering eyes and wheezing in my dorm room. Turns out there was a stage 2 smog alert going on that afternoon, and I didn't have a clue."" 
Our ruling 
Obama said that as a student at Occidental College in Los Angeles from 1979 to 1981, ""there were days where folks couldn't go outside. … because of all the pollution in the air.""

Does the immigration bill include free 'Obamacars' for teens?
","As chief defender on the right of the Senate immigration bill, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been churning out press releases debunking myths about the bill. ""Remember the ‘Marcophone’ myth? Now we have the Obamacar myth,"" says a June 25 Rubio press release. Yep, you read that right: Rubio, a potential 2016 Republican presidential contender, issued a press release claiming that a conservative slam against the Democratic president is a myth. Rubio’s press release linked to a June 24 article on the conservative news site Breitbart with the headline ""New Immigration bill has taxpayer subsidized Obamacars for youths."" It featured a photo of a goofy-looking Obama climbing into a car. ""Breitbart News has learned there is a provision included in the immigration bill that could be used to give free cars, motorcycles, scooters or other vehicles to young people around the country over a period of 15 months after the bill passes,"" the story said. ""The new provision is a result of the latest addition to the Corker-Hoeven amendment, which is essentially an entirely new version of the bill."" The claim was made multiple times on the Internet, including on Fox News on June 25. The commentators joked about the alleged car giveaway with contributor Laura Ingraham asking, ""I want to know, are Segway scooters part of the deal?’ "" PolitiFact previously examined a claim by bloggers that proposed immigration legislation would give away taxpayer-funded cell phones. We ruled that claim False. That referred to grants aimed at helping American ranchers and others in remote locations along the border get satellite phone service so they can be in touch with authorities. Are free ""Obamacars"" another rumor driven off track? The roots of the car rumor The Breitbart article related to an amendment filed in June by Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and John Hoeven, R-N.D., to the Senate immigration bill. Their amendment would double the number of border patrol agents to 20,000, complete 700 miles of fencing, and add E-Verify for employment, among other requirements. Another amendment by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was tacked on to the Corker-Hoeven amendment, and passed on a procedural vote, 67-27, on June 24. The Breitbart article credited another conservative publication, the Washington Examiner, for uncovering ""the new Obama stimulus program"" that was part of the Sanders amendment. The Examiner article stated that a version of the bill would provide $1.5 billion for jobs for American youth, and was a sweetener to get Sanders’ support. Sanders' intention was to help unemployed young people hit hard by the recession. In a June 21 press release, his office said it was ""the least Congress should do in a bill that allows college students from around the world to take jobs that young Americans would otherwise perform."" The Breitbart article relied on an anonymous GOP Senate aide to explain the amendment:""This appears to give states authority to buy, lease or rent motorcycles, cars and scooters or anything kids want to buy to get to and from a job,"" the GOP aide said. But the Examiner article and the Sanders press release didn’t mention cars, motorcycles, scooters -- heck, not even a tricycle. So we hit the virtual road in search of some sort of transportation connection. Sanders amendment would provide transportation ‘services’ A fact sheet about the amendment by Sanders stated that the money for the jobs program would include providing ""important services such as transportation and child care, necessary to enable young Americans to participate in job opportunities."" Neither the fact sheet nor the amendment defines transportation services. Rubio’s press release states that transportation services ""means the program could provide a service, like a bus ride to a work site, but it cannot provide a car, scooter, motorcycle, or pair of rollerblades."" Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told PolitiFact in an email that ""...the key word in the legislation is ‘service.’ That qualifier means that they will be provided ‘services’ and not ‘goods’ as in ‘goods and services’ (a common term when referring to tangibles and intangibles). In practice, it means the program can gives kids a bus pass – but it’s not giving them a car."" Breitbart published a new post in response to Rubio saying his ""narrow reading of the bill is unlikely to be applied by the federal government."" We asked Warren Gunnels, senior policy adviser to Sanders, who would decide what could qualify as a transportation service. If the law passed, the U.S. Labor Department would have 20 days to create regulations for the jobs program and states would have 30 days to respond. Gunnels said that local workforce boards would come up with proposals that would be vetted by states and then submitted to the Labor Department, which would have the final say. So to believe the Obamacar claim would mean, for example, that a workforce board in Miami would suggest that it would give away free cars or motorcycles, Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s administrators would give that the thumbs up, and the Labor Department would declare that engines go. To be fair, it’s not expressly spelled out in the amendment that car/scooter/rollerblade giveaways are a no-no and that bus passes are a cheaper idea, but there is also no proof that the government would give away vehicles. The transportation and childcare services language is similar to Obama’s American Jobs Act presented to Congress in 2011, which never became law. Sanders provided PolitiFact a response via his spokesman: ""This amendment addresses a crisis in youth unemployment in this country. The unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds is 24.5 percent and higher for Hispanics and African-Americans. What my amendment says, which is obvious, is that providing a job for a young person is meaningless if they don’t have transportation to be able to get to that job. So the program has the option of providing funding for bus fare or subway tickets or other means of transportation. It is only the wild imagination that we have come to expect from Fox TV that would come up with this preposterous idea that we are buying automobiles for young people."" Our ruling An amendment by Sanders to the immigration bill would provide a youth jobs program that includes the possibility of transportation and child care services. That prompted conservative news outlets to make claims such as, ""New Immigration bill has taxpayer subsidized Obamacars for youths."" Sanders’ amendment doesn’t define in detail what the transportation services would entail. Ultimately if the bill passes, local workforce boards would propose jobs programs that would be signed off by the states and approved by the U.S. Labor Department. There is no proof to support the idea that the program would include free car, motorcycle or scooter giveaways. In fact, that such a process would end up allowing car giveaways seems laughable. We are putting the brakes on this rumor.

Fundraising email puts words in Gingrey’s mouth
","
Before the U.S. Supreme Court decides the fate of the Defense of Marriage Act, U.S. House members made their case for upholding the law during a round of floor speeches last week. 
During his roughly five-minute speech, Marietta Republican Phil Gingrey affirmed his support for traditional marriage, suggested some value-teaching methods for young people, and outraged  some of his critics all at the same time. 
Georgia’s WIN List, a political action committee that helps recruit and train Democratic women for political office, sent out an email the day after Gingrey’s comments. The email message was sent as part of a fundraising plea and signed by the PAC’s chairwoman, Lauren Benedict. 
""Rep. Phil Gingrey is promoting the teaching of gender stereotypes in elementary schools. He wants public schools to teach women to ‘stay in their place,’ "" the email said. 
""Your gift of $50, $100,  or $250 will help us show these men that a woman’s ‘place’ is in the House and in the Senate!"" the message ends. 
""Stay in their place"" and ""place"" were in single quotes in the email. 
Gingrey, one of four major Republican candidates running in Georgia for the Senate, has already made a name for himself in the questionable statements category. Earlier this year, he said  Senate candidate Todd Akin of Missouri was ""partly right"" that a woman’s body has a way of shutting down if she’s raped to prevent pregnancy. 
We wondered whether Gingrey had again made controversial statements about women. Did he really say schools should teach them to ""stay in their place?""  We decided to take a closer look. 
A day after Benedict’s PAC sent out its anti-Gingrey email, Better Georgia -- a left-leaning political group -- sent out its own email/fundraising message opposing conservative Georgia congressmen. That group said that the men, including Gingrey, want to be sure that women ""know their place."" 
But what exactly did Gingrey say? 
A review of the tape shows that Gingrey spends part of his time talking about Father’s Day and his own family. He admits that the old family model that was illustrated in television classics like ""Father Knows Best"" are outdated, but he holds firm to his belief that families need a mother and a father to work well. 
""You know, maybe part of the problem is we need to go back into the schools ... and have a class for the young girls and have a class for the young boys and say ... what’s important,"" Gingrey said. ""This is what a father does that is maybe a little different, maybe a little bit better than the talents that a mom has in a certain area. And the same thing for the young girls, that ... this is what a mom does, and this is what is important from the standpoint of that union which we call marriage."" 
Record of his comments quickly made headlines and were picked up by several news outlets, including Fox News and the Huffington Post. 
PolitiFact Georgia  reviewed a video of Gingrey’s remarks several times. And we found that he  never used the phrase about women that they should ""stay in their place"" or ""know their place."" We asked Benedict about the PAC’s claim. 
In an email to us, Benedict -- who is also a member of the Macon City Council -- said the use of single quotes around the phrase was for emphasis and not intended to be a direct quote of Gingrey’s comments. She says Gingrey’s recommendation for the gender classes presents a 1950s view of marriage. 
""What else, other than the desire for women to stay in their place, can be inferred from these statements and Gingrey’s desire to have separate classes to teach traditional gender roles,"" Benedict wrote. 
Gingrey’s spokeswoman, Jen Talaber, provided us with a statement similar to what was provided to another Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter last week. She did not address specific questions about the criticism and it being used in fundraiser statements. 
""Phil is a strong supporter of traditional marriage and believes strong male and female role models are essential in a child’s development. Phil was speaking theoretically to emphasize his point that kids learn different things from their mothers and fathers,"" the statement said. 
Political parties send out this type of ""red meat"" rhetoric to solicit funds and energize their party base, their most loyal voters, said Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University. 
""Both parties will try and make the other look as extreme as possible,"" he said. ""In this case, they are making the case for extremism against women."" 
So, does the Democratic PAC’s claim measure up? 
In an email, a leader at Georgia’s WIN List said that Gingrey wanted public schools to teach women to ""stay in their place."" The group said that the phrase ""to stay in their place"" was for emphasis and not a direct quote from Gingrey. Video of the congressman’s comments show that he did not use this phrase. 
Gingrey did make statements about gender roles that some critics found offensive. 
But Benedict quotes Gingrey as mouthing specific words that he did not utter.

Rep. Tim Ryan says the United States ranks behind other countries in social mobility
","
After votes conclude for the day, members of Congress can book time at the U.S. House of Representatives’ podium to deliver floor speeches on their favorite topics. That’s what Youngstown-area Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan did earlier this month when he and California Democratic Rep. John Garamendi held forth on the ""The American Dream,"" and obstacles the poor face in their efforts to improve their situation. 
""If you are born poor in America, we rank about ninth or tenth in our citizens’ ability to climb up through that ladder and get themselves into the middle class,"" Ryan told Garamendi, arguing that the United States had moved away from a philosophy it had until the mid 1980s when it made educational investments that facilitated people’s economic rise. 
Because the ability to rise from rags to riches is a key facet of the American Dream, we asked Ryan’s office where he got his sobering statistic about America’s lack of social mobility. Ryan spokesman Pat Lowry said it came from a March 2010 article in the British newspaper, The Guardian, which was reporting on a study produced by a Paris-based coalition of 34 countries, including the United States. The study performed by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development found it is easier to climb the social ladder in other developed countries than it is in the United States, Italy and Britain. In that study, Denmark, Australia, Norway, Finland, Canada, Sweden, Germany, Spain and France all scored ahead of the United States in children’s ability to exceed their parents’ income. 
The study found that in the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom, at least 40 percent of the economic advantage that high-earning fathers have over low-earning fathers is transmitted to their sons. In countries with more social mobility, just 20 percent of that advantage carries into the next generation. 
""Policies that facilitate access to education of individuals from disadvantaged family backgrounds promote intergenerational wage mobility, and are also likely to be good for economic growth,"" the study said. 
Its findings echo similar research conducted in the United States. A 2008 report on economic mobility produced by the Pew Charitable Trusts and Brookings Institution found that while ""Americans have an optimistic faith in the ability of individuals to get ahead within a lifetime or from one generation to the next, there is growing evidence of less intergenerational economic mobility in the United States than in many other rich, industrialized countries."" 
It noted yet another study that showed U.S. social mobility lags behind Canada and several other northern European countries, but observed that other research has found U.S. social mobility exceeds that of developing countries such as Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. The research on developing countries equated America’s level of social mobility with that of Pakistan and Nepal, though it cautioned that statistics for developing countries are harder to come by because they lack income surveys that span three or more decades, so researchers must estimate how much money participants’ parents made. 
During the 2012 election cycle, Republicans including presidential candidate Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan of Wisconsin observed that mobility in the U.S. lags behind other countries. 
A 2012 New York Times article on the subject cited some of the factors that hinder social mobility in the U.S., like pay tilted toward educated workers and the magnitude of the gaps between the rich and middle class. It notes the U.S. ""maintains a thinner safety net than other rich countries,"" and that ""poor Americans are more likely than foreign peers to grow up with single mothers. 
""That places them at an elevated risk of experiencing poverty and related problems, a point frequently made by Mr. Santorum,"" the article says. ""The United States also has uniquely high incarceration rates, and a longer history of racial stratification than its peers."". 
While it flies in the face of the notion that anyone can rise from the bottom to the top in the United States, a number of studies uphold Ryan’s contention that America’s social mobility lags behind that of many other countries. America’s exact ranking in those studies depends on which countries are surveyed, but the research Ryan alluded to did find the U.S. to be 10th among the 12 examined countries. 
However, it is important to clarify that those 12 were all developed countries, and other research has found that U.S. social mobility exceeds that of developing countries.  Ryan did not qualify his statement to reflect that. We rate it Mostly True.","[('\nHouse of Representatives floor speech by Tim Ryan, June 11, 2013', 'https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-06-11/pdf/CREC-2013-06-11-pt1-PgH3274.pdf#page=5'), ('\nEmails with Ryan spokesman Pat Lowry, June 17-20, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nThe Guardian, OECD: UK has worse social mobility than other developed countries, March 10, 2010', 'http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/mar/10/oecd-uk-worst-social-mobility#'), ('\nOrganisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, Intergenerational Social Mobility: A Family Affair?

Nearly $2 billion per year to expand school vouchers in state budget, Wisconsin Assembly Democratic leader says
","
As Republican Wisconsin lawmakers crafted the 2013-15 state budget, outraged Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca sent out a fund-raising plea. 
Seeking contributions to the Assembly Democratic Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the Assembly, Barca blasted the work of the GOP-controlled Joint Finance Committee on the two-year tax-and-spending plan. 
In a June 5, 2013 email, the Kenosha Democrat decried the proposed creation of a private bail bond system and a $651 million income tax cut. Then he turned to a proposed expansion of the private school voucher program. 
Citing a figure from the state Department of Public Instruction, Barca said the budget included: 
""An expansion of taxpayer-funded, unaccountable private school vouchers across the state, which DPI estimated could cost nearly $2 billion annually."" 
That’s a lot of money. 
The figure caught our attention because Barca’s email was on the 2013-15 budget; the $651 million income tax cut, for example, refers to how much income taxes will be reduced over the two-year period. 
On the school voucher expansion Barca criticized, the budget awaiting Gov. Scott Walker’s signature limits to 1,500 the number of students who could be added to the program during the two-year cycle. 
Could that expansion really cost taxpayers nearly $2 billion per year? 
Not even close. 
Barca’s evidence 
Long a subject of controversy, the voucher program, also known as school choice, was launched in 1990 in Milwaukee and was extended to the Racine area in 2011. It is intended to improve results for poor city children in public schools by allowing them to attend private or religious schools with publicly funded vouchers. 
Barca spokeswoman Melanie Conklin told us her boss based his nearly $2 billion claim on an email that state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers sent to school district superintendents and other educators six days before Barca's fund-raising email. 
Evers, who opposes the voucher expansion, wrote: 
""While the current proposal includes an initial enrollment cap, past history clearly demonstrates those are temporary at best. We estimate that vouchers on a statewide scale could ultimately cost up to $1.9 billion annually,further diverting scarce resources away from public schools and increasing local property taxes."" 
To be clear, the $1.9 billion-per-year estimate applies to the total cost of the voucher program, not the limited expansion that would take place over the next two years with the new budget. 
Moreover, Evers' use of ultimately dooms Barca’s claim. While Barca's fund-raising email was about the 2013-15 budget, the $1.9 billion cost estimate is for some time in the future. 
Barca's spokeswoman also forwarded us another Evers email, which referenced a detailed DPI estimate. It says the voucher expansion cost could reach $1.9 billion per year if 20 percent of students statewide -- nearly 193,000 students -- enrolled in the voucher program. 
That's far more than the 25,000 voucher students currently in the program and the 1,500 that would be added in the next two years. 
DPI spokesman John Johnson told us that with the expansion provided for in the 2013-15 budget, the voucher program will cost about $385 million over the two years. 
That's an average of about $192.5 million per year. 
A far cry from what Barca led the recipients of his email to believe. 
A footnote before we close: A little noticed provision in the budget could potentially allow for expansion beyond the 1,500 students. But even if that expansion occurs, the additional cost is estimated at only $4 million in the 2013-15 budget, Johnson said. Moreover, the disclosure didn’t come until two weeks after Barca’s email. 
Our rating 
Criticizing a Republican-backed expansion of the school voucher program in the 2013-15 state budget, Barca said the state Department of Public Instruction estimated that the expansion ""could cost nearly $2 billion annually."" 
But the cost of the entire voucher program -- not just the expansion -- averages $192.5 million per year for the 2013-15 budget cycle. 
DPI's $1.9 billion-per-year estimate is not based on the 2013-15 expansion; it would only apply if the voucher program expands dramatically years down the road.

"['Abortion', 'Texas', 'Wendy Davis']","
Wendy Davis says 92 percent of Texas counties had no abortion provider in 2008
","
A Democrat bent on talking to death a proposal pitched by backers as improving the safety of abortion clinics while imposing other limits bandied a statistic about existing access to abortion toward the beginning of her filibuster. 
State Sen. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth quoted to Senate colleagues from written testimony submitted at a March 19, 2013, hearing on a different bill by Physicians for Reproductive Health, a group whose website says it advocates reproductive health services. 
From the testimony, which Davis called ""compelling,"" the senator apparently read aloud: ""‘While Texas women have the right to safe, legal abortion, in reality there are already very few facilities in Texas to provide this essential care. In 2008, 92 percent of Texas counties had no abortion provider.’"" Davis said the testimony attributed the statistic to the New York-based Guttmacher Institute, a research group focusing on reproductive health issues.   
And is the statistic accurate? 
In a telephone interview, Guttmacher spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said the statistic came from the latest round of its occasional national study tabulating abortion providers by county, ""Abortion Incidence and Access to Services in the United States, 2008."" 
However, Wind counseled, another statistic built into each study can be more revealing. In Texas in 2008, she said, 33 percent of women of child-bearing age lived in the counties without abortion facilities, according to the study, which based its count of women on U.S. Census Bureau figures. 
Generally, Wind said, ""metropolitan areas have higher numbers of women and higher numbers of providers."" 
The study covering 2008 was published in 2010; Wind said an updated census, covering 2010-11, is to be published in 2014. 
The description of methodology in the study covering 2008 said, ""All facilities known or expected to have provided abortion services in 2007 and 2008 were contacted, including hospitals, clinics and physicians’ offices."" There were 67 Texas facilities, the report said. 
The study noted that it had likely missed some providers. ""Undoubtedly, some abortion providers were not counted because we were unable to identify them,"" the study said. A 1994 survey found Guttmacher’s 1992 count overlooked ""a number of small providers,"" it said. ""Undercounting has likely become more pronounced over the last decade"" as non-surgical facilities offered an abortion-inducing drug. 
We also looked for a state-level count of abortion providers by county. 
By email, Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, told us that according to the state’s most recent count, 74 facilities reported having performed abortions in 2011.  Of those, the agency said, 41 were holders of an abortion facility license, 28 were hospitals, four were ambulatory surgical centers and one was a physician’s office. 
We did not obtain the locations or addresses of those listed in 2011, but Williams provided addresses for the state’s 36 abortion facility license-holders as of late June 2013 (a group that excludes hospitals, doctors’ offices and ambulatory surgical centers). 
By telephone, Williams said most Texas abortions are performed at such facilities. A small percentage of abortions take place in hospitals and physicians’ offices, she said. 
By our calculation, the 36 centers were located in about 18 Texas counties, or 7 percent of the state’s 254 counties. Geographically, they were located from Beaumont and Jefferson County near Louisiana west to El Paso County and from Lubbock County on the plains south to Hidalgo and Starr counties on the Rio Grande. The centers were mostly in the populous counties of Harris, Fort Bend, Dallas, Tarrant, Travis and Bexar. 
Our ruling 
Davis said that in 2008, 92 percent of Texas counties had no abortion provider. 
Her statement matched the Guttmacher Institute’s findings, which seem supported by the locations of Texas abortion facility license holders as of late June 2013. But the institute’s study also said it likely undercounted facilities, while presenting an arguably more meaningful statistic; 33 percent of Texas women of child-bearing age lived in counties lacking abortion providers, meaning more than 65 percent lived in a county with a provider. 
Davis’ statement lacked these clarifications, making it Mostly True.","[('\nTestimony presented by Physicians for Reproductive Health, Texas Senate Committee on Health and Human Services, hearing on SB 537, March 19, 2013', 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z6ZivJ2sjlpSfMhgJqxsSOElJ42D_XO8ADozgLkgmZQ/edit?usp=sharing'), ('\nTelephone interview, Rebecca Wind, senior communications associate, Guttmacher Institute, New York, June 25, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nGuttmacher Institute study, ""Abortion Incidence and Access to Services in the United States, 2008""', 'https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4304111.html'), ('\nEmail and telephone interview, Carrie Williams, director of media relations, Texas Department of State Health Services, Austin, June 25, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nDocument, Texas abortion facilities, Texas Department of State Health Services, June 25, 2013 (received by email from Carrie Williams)', 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sAgCXhlS3DGOxmKqcxNJ5DVjSS73aslgzEiWrA4pYwk/pub')]",/factchecks/2013/jun/25/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-92-percent-texas-counties-had-no-/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'National Republican Congressional Committee']","
Washington's Kim Schrier is no Bernie Sanders, nor is her health plan his
","""Medicare for All"" is today’s catch phrase for government supported, single-payer health care, and if you’re a free-market Republican, that can sound like a path toward socialism. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician in Washington state who’s running for Congress, uttered that phrase, and Republicans in the other Washington (D.C.) even have it on videotape. ""Look, ultimately I think we do need to go to a Medicare for All system,"" Schrier said. The video clip, with suspenseful music added for emphasis, is part of an ad put out by the National Republican Campaign Committee, or NRCC, an arm of the Republican Party that supports Republicans running for the U.S. House of Representatives. The NRCC supports Dino Rossi, a Republican former state senator, in the race for the open seat in Washington’s 8th Congressional District, which stretches from the Seattle suburbs across the Cascades. Medicare for All, the Republican ad says, would mean ""your employer-based health coverage"" would be ""eliminated. Your income tax could double. Kim Schrier’s plan will put your health care in the hands of government bureaucrats and require historic tax increases for Washington families. Washington can’t afford Kim Schrier in Congress."" We could approach this by asking whether ""Medicare for All"" would do this, as we’ll do briefly. But another question arises: Does Schrier really have a plan like this? Let’s see. Medicare for All can mean different things. In its broadest sense, it means that the country would get rid of the current system of multiple health insurers vying for your or your employer’s premiums. Instead, the government would build on an existing taxpayer-supported system: Medicare, the federal program that already covers seniors age 65 and older. It does not mean the government would pick your doctor or hospital. Instead, the government would set or negotiate payment rates to providers, and you’d go to the doctor of your choice. The costs and many other details for such a system are in debate, with critics saying that even a doubling of all individual and corporate income taxes would be insufficient. Supporters say the savings in health care premiums and administrative costs would balance this out, and one proposed bill in the House — a bill with 123 co-sponsors, all Democrats — would raise taxes on the incomes of the top 5 percent of earners and on stock and bond transactions. (For a fuller look at this, check out PolitiFact’s annotated checks of an op-ed by President Donald Trump, who called Medicare for All part of Democrats’ ""radical agenda."") But there are variations on this idea within Congress. One set of proposals would let you or your employer keep the insurance you have but, alternatively, let you buy coverage in the Medicare system if you wanted. Another set of proposals would only open Medicare to individuals and small employers, keeping large-employer insurance largely unchanged. And yet another would allow Medicare buy-in only to people age 50 or 55. Each one of these variations has been introduced in Congress. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a handy side-by-side comparison of eight of these bills. On her campaign website, Schrier says ""quality health care is a fundamental human right,"" and that is why she says she wants Medicare for All — but not yet. It will take time, she says, because it will take a Democrat in the White House and Democratic majorities in Congress to pass, and then more time to implement. For now, she says, Congress should allow a voluntary buy-in. ""Too many Washingtonians face skyrocketing healthcare costs, and we need to take immediate steps to help them get the coverage they need and deserve,"" her website says. ""That’s why I am committed to moving us toward a Medicare for All system that guarantees affordable, high-quality care for every American. Medicare has proven to be the most cost-efficient way to deliver high-quality care. ""But we cannot simply wait for a Democratic president and Democratic majorities in Congress to pass a bill that will take years to implement. In the meantime, we need to take immediate action to stabilize our insurance market and build on the ACA (Affordable Care Act) in the short term and implement a Medicare public option immediately, as we work toward a universal system."" Schrier’s Medicare buy-in would be handled through state health care exchanges -- the Affordable Care Act marketplaces -- with private individual and small-group plans offered as well. Prices would be based on a sliding scale, with subsidies available for the neediest. The video clip in the NRCC ad comes directly from Schrier’s campaign website’s video. But there are major differences. The NRCC added scary music and cut off Schrier right after she said, ""Look, ultimately I think we do need to go to a Medicare for All system."" The full video is more than 12 minutes long. And right after mentioning Medicare for All, Schrier says, ""But I see patients and what they are going through, and we do not have the luxury of waiting until we have a Democratic Congress, a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president to get Medicare for All. We need to take action right away."" She then lays out her ""buy-in, public option"" plan. So on what does the NRCC base its claim that Schrier would eliminate your employer coverage, put ""your health care in the hands of government bureaucrats"" and require ""historic tax increases?"" The ad gives citations on the screen. The part about employer coverage cites a 2017 New York Times analysis on the proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for single-payer health care. ""The employer-based insurance that now covers 156 million people would be eliminated,"" the Times story said. ""Those people would lose their current coverage and be enrolled in the new program instead."" For the possible doubling of taxes, the screen cites an Associated Press story from July, which said, ""Sen. Bernie Sanders’ ‘Medicare for All’ plan would boost government health spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years, requiring historic tax hikes, says a study released Monday by a university-based libertarian policy center."" This is a study from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Sanders disputes the high-end cost. The New York Times’ and other analyses have said there would be trade-offs, because people could spend less on health care and premiums. As for the government’s control, the ad’s screen cites a July story in The Hill. The article was about comments from Seema Verma, Trump’s administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs Medicare. ""By choosing a socialized system, you are giving the government complete control over the decisions pertaining to your care or whether you receive care at all,"" Verma said in a speech in San Francisco, as the article reported. The NRCC’s claims about Schrier assume she wants a Medicare for All program similar to the one promoted by Sanders and a number of House members. Schrier doesn’t specify anyone’s single proposal but says Medicare for All is desirable in the long term -- but unrealistic for now. So when would she want it? We asked her campaign, and spokeswoman Katie Rodihan answered without giving a date because, she said, Schrier isn’t even promoting that kind of plan. ""Dr. Schrier's plan specifically does not eliminate employer-based coverage, does not require an income tax increase, does not give the government ‘complete control,’ and does not require historic tax increases,"" Rodihan said in an email. She added that the bill the ad seems to cite ""is Bernie Sanders' plan, not Kim Schrier's,"" and that ""Kim does not"" support it. ""The fact is that Kim has her own plan that is separate and distinct from Medicare for All."" The NRCC says ""Kim Schrier’s Medicare for All plan"" would eliminate employer-provided health coverage, ""put your health care in the hands of government bureaucrats and require historic tax increases."" It is true that Schrier said, ""Look, ultimately I think we do need to go to a Medicare for All system,"" but she then said a lot more, and the ad ignores it all, instead citing criticisms of a specific plan she doesn’t support (and those criticisms themselves are in dispute). Her plan would make Medicare available to all -- all who chose it, that is. The day may come when a Sanders-like plan is viable and politically realistic, but Schrier made clear that since that day is not now, she is focused elsewhere. We rate the claim Mostly False.","[('""Single payer,"" ad from the National Republican Congressional Committee', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=FuiEMLmmxcU'), ('Kim Schrier for Congress campaign website, ""Quality health care is a fundamental right.""', 'No link'), ('Email and telephone conversations with Katie Rodihan, communications director for Schrier campaign, Oct. 10, 2018', 'https://www.drkimschrier.com/issues/healthcare/'), ('Email conversations with Jack Pandol, spokesman, National Republican Congressional Committee, Oct. 10 and 11, 2018', 'No link'), ('Side-by-side comparison of Medicare for all and public plan proposals, Kaiser Family Foundation, Oct. 9, 2018', 'http://files.kff.org/attachment/Table-Side-by-Side-Comparison-Medicare-for-all-Public-Plan-Proposals'), ('""Donald Trump\'s USA Today op-ed, annotated,"" PolitiFact, Oct. 10, 2018', 'No link'), ('""The costs of a national single-payer healthcare system,"" by Charles Blahous, Mercatus Center, George Mason University, July 30, 2018', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/oct/10/donald-trumps-usa-today-op-ed-annotated/'), ('H.R. 676, Expanded and improved Medicare for All Act, U.S. House of Representatives', 'No link'), ('""How Medicare for All would affect you,"" by Haeyoun Park and Margot Sanger-Katch, New York Times, Sept. 14, 2017', 'https://www.mercatus.org/publications/federal-fiscal-policy/costs-national-single-payer-healthcare-system'), ('""Study: \'Medicare for all\' projected to cost $32.6 trillion,"" by Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Associated Press, July 30, 2018', 'No link'), ('""Top Trump health official slams \'Medicare for all,’"" by Nathaniel Weixel, The Hill, July 25, 2018', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676/text')]",/factchecks/2018/oct/11/national-republican-congressional-committee/washingtons-kim-schrier-no-bernie-sanders-nor-her-/
"['West Virginia', 'Education', 'Legal Issues', 'Joe Manchin']","
Did Patrick Morrisey make efforts to put educators in jail?
","The West Virginia teachers’ strike in February was months ago, but rhetoric about the strike has continued to crop up on the campaign trail. On Sept. 14, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. -- who is in a tough reelection contest against West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey -- tweeted, ""It’s really a shame that Pat doesn’t have the guts to answer questions about his lawsuit to take away coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, his career as a Washington lobbyist for the opioid industry, or his efforts to put educators in jail."" “It’s really a shame that Pat doesn’t have the guts to answer questions about his lawsuit to take away coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, his career as a Washington lobbyist for the opioid industry, or his efforts to put educators in jail.” https://t.co/R94dTXNJvY We’ve already looked at the question of pre-existing conditions and his lobbying history, so we decided to look at the question about the teachers’ strike. PolitiFact previously concluded that Morrisey was on solid legal ground when he said the teacher strike was unlawful. But did he make efforts to put teachers behind bars, as Manchin charged? Let’s take a closer look. (Manchin’s office did not respond to inquiries.) Teachers in West Virginia went on a nine-day strike on Feb. 23, 2018, after Republican Gov. Jim Justice signed a bill giving teachers and other state employees a 1 percent to 2 percent pay raise, an amount they deemed insufficient. The striking teachers teachers sought higher salaries and relief from rising health care costs. The strike involved 34,000 workers and touched all 55 counties; it was considered one of the nation's biggest strikes in recent years, according to Tthe New York Times. It ended when Justice signed a bill giving teachers a 5 percent raise. From the start, Morrisey asserted that the strike was unlawful. On Feb. 21, 2018, he tweeted, ""The impending work stoppage is unlawful and should come to an end."" As we’ve previously reported, there was precedent for this. During a 1990 teacher strike, the West Virginia Supreme Court found that the stoppage was unlawful because ""public employees provide essential public services which, if interrupted by strikes, would threaten the public welfare."" A preliminary injunction was issued by Jefferson County Court in 1990, ending the strike. MetroNews reported that Morrissey was ready to take legal action against striking teachers if he was asked to do so under the law. ""Let us make no mistake,"" Morrisey told MetroNews on Feb. 21. ""The impending work stoppage is unlawful. State law and court rulings give specific parties avenues to remedy such illegal conduct, including the option to seek an injunction to end an unlawful strike."" However, Morrisey’s words were more precise -- and accurate -- than Manchin’s. Morrisey said the strikes would be unlawful -- but that doesn’t mean they would lead to ""jail"" for striking teachers. ""The teachers may have been subject to an injunction to go back to work, but they could not have been prosecuted for going out on strike,"" said West Virginia University law professor Bob Bastress. In a news release at the time, Morrisey talked about the possibility of seeking an injunction -- but not jail. ""State law and court rulings give specific parties avenues to remedy such illegal conduct, including the option to seek an injunction to end an unlawful strike,"" he wrote. When we reached out to Morrisey’s campaign, a spokesman said that Morrisey never suggested locking up teachers. ""You can go through his statements from the time, and you won't find anything that suggests what Manchin is claiming,"" the campaign said in a statement. When asked about what Morrisey meant when hold MetroNews he was willing to take ""legal action"" against teachers, the Morrisey campaign cited an opinion letter by the then-Attorney General, Democrat Roger Tompkins, in 1990. Tompkins wrote that teachers who went on strike in 1990 could be ""disqualified from teaching in a public school for one year, and the state department of education and county board of education may withhold all papers and credentials of such teacher."" These are serious consequences -- but well short of jail. ""Morrisey has civil legal authority, which does not include criminal authority,"" the campaign said. ""That authority is left to the governor and the criminal justice system."" Manchin tweeted that Morrisey made ""efforts to put educators in jail."" Morrisey, in his capacity as attorney general, said the strike was unlawful -- but that meant that striking teachers could have been punished by disciplinary actions, not criminal charges that could land them in jail. While the disciplinary actions could have had severe consequences in some cases, Manchin’s suggestion that ""jail"" could have resulted is a significant exaggeration.

"['Death Penalty', 'Pennsylvania', 'Jeff Bartos']","
Lt. Gov. hopeful Jeff Bartos says the death penalty is a deterrent. Researchers disagree.
","Jeff Bartos, the Republican candidate for Pennsylvania lieutenant governor, said in a debate Saturday that there isn’t yet consensus on whether the death penalty serves as an effective criminal deterrent. ""In terms of capital punishment and my views on capital punishment, the jury is very much still out about whether it’s a deterrent factor or not, but what I am certain of is a specific deterrent with the most heinous crimes — what we see happening on school grounds and when we see people slaughtering children, and we see certain people sitting on death row who have wantonly just destroyed families and lives, they deserve the death penalty and to take that away from a judge and a jury, in my opinion, is wrong,"" Bartos said during a pre-recorded debate filmed Saturday afternoon aired that evening by WPXI-TV in Pittsburgh. The preceding question mentioned gubernatorial running mate Scott Wagner’s proposed policy of a mandatory death sentence for school shooters in asking Bartos about his position on the death penalty. Asked to clarify Bartos’ answer Wednesday, Andrew Romeo, a spokesman with the Wagner-Bartos campaign, said by email, ""Since (the proposed policy) has not been tried yet in Pennsylvania, there is no way to tell whether or not it will be a deterrent, but Scott and Jeff believe it will be."" But is there evidence to support their belief? And does 60 years of research support the notion that the death penalty has any role in deterring criminal activity? Both death penalty advocates and abolitionists have troves of competing data on the effectiveness of capital punishment as a deterrent, to say nothing of the ethical, moral and religious arguments around its use. Some studies point to comparable or nearly identical murder rates between states with the death penalty and those without it. Others argue a statistical correlation between the death penalty and reductions in murder rates. But the 30,000-foot view offers no such assurances and certainly doesn’t support the notion of the death penalty as a significant factor in preventing crimes, the most heinous included. ""I don’t know empirically that anyone can demonstrate it’s a deterrent,"" said John Rago, an associate professor at the Duquesne University School of Law. ""The death penalty has always struck me as an expression of society’s condemnation of a particular act, as opposed to an attempt to deter others from doing it."" Rago pointed to a June 2018 report on the death penalty for the Pennsylvania Joint State Government Commission. In it, a task force and advisory committee reports to the commission that research on the subject of the death penalty as a deterrence factor is severely lacking. ""In a state like Pennsylvania with a relatively large number of death sentences but almost no executions, the deterrent effect of the death penalty is attenuated, regardless of whether a more vigorously applied death penalty would have a deterrent effect"" the study states, citing decades of research in supporting this conclusion. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf imposed a moratorium on executions shortly after taking office in 2015. The Pa. Department of Corrections reported a 0.6 percent decrease in murders the following year. But Department of Health records show 48 more homicides in 2016 — the most recent year for which data are available — than in 2015. Decades earlier, in the midst of a de facto four-year moratorium on executions imposed by the Supreme Court, FBI data show Pennsylvania murders and nonnegligent manslaughters rose each year before falling to a five-year low in 1976, the year SCOTUS reinstated the death penalty. In that same time, the national total of murders and nonnegligent manslaughters rose before also falling in 1976. The numbers in Pennsylvania and nationwide have fallen and risen in the decades since. But, again, experts say causality between the death penalty’s status and murder rates has not been convincingly demonstrated. Marshall Dayan, an assistant federal public defender in the capital habeas unit of the federal public defender’s office for the western district of Pennsylvania, was one of 30 advisory committee members behind the June report to the Pennsylvania Joint State Government Commission. He said he’s represented people charged with or convicted of capital crimes for more than 30 years and that anecdotally he’s found ""the death penalty isn't a deterrent because nobody thinks they're going to be caught."" ""So over the course of 30 years my clients have told me ‘Of course we didn't care. It made no difference to us whether it’s death or life without parole or boiling us alive in hot oil,"" Dayan added. Daniel Nagin, a researcher and professor of public policy and statistics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College, said of this outlook in a 2014 piece by the Washington Post, ""It’s the certainty of apprehension that’s been demonstrated consistently to be an effective deterrent, not the severity of the ensuing consequences."" In a phone conversation Wednesday, Nagin, who was chair of the Committee on Deterrence and the Death Penalty, the group behind a 2012 report for the National Academy of Sciences on this subject, said the conclusion of their review was that the research on the death penalty was so flawed that it was ""uninformative on the question of whether there was a deterrent effect of the death penalty, that is whether the death penalty increased [crime], decreased [crime] or had no effect…"" Nagin said the body of research was deemed flawed, in large part, because it failed to take into account whether the death penalty was a greater deterrent than other options available to the criminal justice system. He said to his knowledge that hasn’t changed in the six years since. Dayan said the question of whether the death penalty is a more effective deterrent than other penalties is crucial when considering the death penalty’s role in preventing crime. ""The question is not whether the death penalty deters in a vacuum,"" he said, ""the question is whether there's any additional deterrent effect of threatening to kill somebody versus threatening to incarcerate someone for a long period of time or forever."" Dayan added, ""It’s not like the options are either you get sentenced to death or we give you the key to the city."" From a public policy perspective, the question may be doubly relevant. While pro-death penalty advocates have pointed to the sense of closure it can offer victims’ families, the underpinnings of state-sanctioned killings is that they preserve life by looming over criminal deliberations and, when effective, preventing atrocities. And while it also hasn’t been conclusively determined that the death penalty does deter crime, it also hasn’t been demonstrated that it doesn’t, Nagin explained. ""Policy makers should not look to this scientific community or scientific evidence to make judgements about effectiveness of death penalty as a deterrent,"" he said. As for Bartos, if he’s hinging his support for a mandatory death penalty for school shooters on the penalty’s ability to prevent these shootings from happening, his personal conviction may be the only thing conclusively linking the two. ""I want to stress that really smart social scientists have been looking at this for 60 years and have pretty consistently concluded that it can’t be proved one way or the other,"" Dayan said. ""Sixty years with no conclusion suggests to me there is a conclusion, that is we can't either prove or disprove deterrence and so if you want to rest public policy on the deterrence rationale — the research just doesn’t support that."" Bartos had a point that the jury is still out on whether the death penalty is an effective deterrent. But he also says he’s certain it is ""a specific deterrent with the most heinous crimes."" Most experts disagree, saying there is no convincing scientific evidence supporting this conclusion. Bartos’ statements also conflict with each other.

#MeToo protester not pictured in 2016 photo of disturbing sign
","A two-year-old viral photo with a disturbing sign about First Lady Melania Trump re-emerged on Facebook on Oct. 8, 2018, garnering more than 11,000 reactions and 8,000 shares. The photo caption said the sign-holder was part of the one-year-old #MeToo movement. That’s not true. The person holding the sign was planted to discredit protesters of President Donald Trump following the 2016 election, according to numerous news reports. Jack Posobiec, who is credited with planting the sign, also heavily promoted the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory and helped organize the DeploraBall, an informal inauguration party marked by clashes between Trump’s supporters and protesters. The photo was posted more recently by Joshua Feuerstein, a former pastor who uses social media to promote his vision of evangelical Christianity. Feuerstein notably made headlines in 2015 for his viral video attacking Starbucks over its holiday cups. The reposted 2016 photo shows someone in a crowd of people holding a sign that says ""Rape Melania."" ""This is the tolerant left #MeToo movement ... suggesting a sexual assault against the First Lady!!! Wow!!"" the accompanying post read. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That photo has made waves on the internet before, originally posted a week after the 2016 election on Twitter by Alan Beck, a Trump supporter whose account has since been suspended. ""DC Trump Protestor (sic) ‘Rape Melania,’"" the original tweet said. People debated the legitimacy of the image and whether it was Photoshopped, but photos of the sign exist from different angles, taken by different people, confirming it was there. Response and reactions from Twitter users caused ""#RapeMelania"" to trend on Twitter, which prompted criticism against the social media platform for allowing such a hashtag to trend.

Spanberger ad on Brat's vote on pre-existing conditions lacks context
","U.S. Rep. Dave Brat has not protected health insurance rates for people with pre-existing conditions, according to Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic challenger in the 7th Congressional District. Spanberger makes the charge in a widely-played TV ad. It features Jody Cametas, a Goochland attorney, saying her son, Mason, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when he was 10. ""He had to learn to test his blood sugar multiple times a day and give himself injections,"" Cametas says. ""And it’s so expensive that many families are sharing supplies to make ends meet. ""I feel betrayed by Dave Brat; he voted against protections for pre-existing conditions for families like mine,"" she says. The screen switches to video of Brat talking and white letters say, ""Brat VOTED AGAINST PROTECTION for pre-existing conditions."" Cametas finishes, ""I voted for Dave Brat once. I will not make that mistake again. I’m voting for Abigail Spanberger."" Brat campaign spokesperson Katie Price has labeled the claim about the congressman’s vote ""a lie,"" and called on Spanberger to ""correct the record immediately."" Spanberger stands by the commercial. So we investigated whether Spanberger’s ad claim is accurate. The vote Spanberger defends her ad by citing Brat’s vote on May 4, 2017 for the American Health Care Act - a Republican bill that would have largely repealed the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The measure passed the House on a mostly partisan 217-213 vote, but died in the Senate. One of the most popular parts of Obamacare is a mandate that health insurers cannot reject people on the basis of pre-existing conditions - such as asthma, cancer, heart disease or diabetes - or charge them exorbitant premiums. The AHCA kept the requirement that people with pre-existing conditions be offered insurance. But it would have changed Obamacare’s rules limiting how much those people could be charged. The legislation would have allowed states to get waivers from individual requirements of Obamacare. Insurers in those states would have been permitted to raise the premiums, for one year, of people with pre-existing conditions who were uninsured for at least 63 straight days the previous year. The bill would have appropriated $8 billion over five years to help people who couldn’t afford their penalty premium. After a year of paying higher rates, penalized people would have again qualify for regular rates. In other words, the bill would have allowed, in some cases, insurers to consider pre-existing conditions in writing policies. But this would have been unusual. The impact The bill would have had little effect on 153 million Americans who get their health insurance through an employer - roughly half the population under 65. It was unknown how many states would apply for waivers. And only some of the people who buy their own insurance would have had a three-month gap in their coverage. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care, estimated that ""6.3 million people ""could potentially face higher premiums under the House’s American Health Care Act (AHCA), due to pre-existing health conditions."" That’s a significant number, but a small portion of all the people under 65 with pre-existing conditions (those 65 or older are eligible for Medicare, which covers almost all previous health issues). The Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that between 50 million and 129 million Americans under 65 might have a pre-existing health condition. That suggests, when combined with the Kaiser’s research, that somewhere between 4 and 13 percent of people under 65 with pre-existing conditions might have faced higher premiums under the AHCA. Our ruling Spanberger’s ad says Brat ""voted against protecting pre-existing conditions,"" and, in a limited way, he did when he supported the AHCA. The bill would have allowed states to request a waiver from a popular Obamacare provision barring insurers from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions. But the sweeping language in the ad makes it seem like the AHCA would affect any child or adult with a pre-existing condition, and that’s not so. In fact, a small portion of them would have been at risk. Kaiser estimates that about 6.3 million people faced potentially higher - much higher - premiums for one year. That’s somewhere 4 and 13 percent of the people under 65 with pre-existing conditions. So Spanburger’s claim is partially accurate, but omits important details and context. We rate it Half True.  ","[('Abigail Spanberger, ""Jody"" ad, Sept. 28, 2018.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeNTqxJP6ng'), ('PolitiFact North Carolina, ""Does new version of the ACHA protect coverage for pre-existing conditions?""

In Kansas, Democrat's attack on Steve Watkins only partially accurate
","The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently aired a tough ad against Republican congressional candidate Steve Watkins, who is locked in a competitive race with Democrat Paul Davis for the House seat in Kansas’ 2nd Congressional District. The ad is based on a Kansas City Star investigation that found Watkins did not own and build a business from the ground up when he was in the Middle East, as he had claimed several times on the campaign trail. The ad’s text: ""Steve Watkins caught lying again. For months, Watkins bragged to voters that he built his own company from scratch, but it was all a lie."" It is accurate that Watkins did not build and own the company— VIAP Inc. — as he has been quoted. However, the Democrats' ad takes the rhetoric too far saying it all was a lie. He did oversee an arm of the organization that had just started, and grew that outfit to several hundred people.  On more than one occasion on the campaign trail, Watkins has said that he started a small business and grew it from ""three people to 470 people."" ""I started an engineering and security company, paramilitary company, that did work strictly for the U.S. government,"" Watkins said during one June GOP meeting. ""This was in Iraq and Afghanistan. We grew to a number of countries. We grew from three people to 470 with me as the principal during that growth period."" The business he was referring to is VIAP Inc., a spinoff of Versar Inc., a global project management firm based in Washington. Watkins didn’t own the company, but he did appear to work there during a high-growth phase. Versar International Inc. was formed in January 1997, according to incorporation filings in Delaware. Watkins graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in West Point in 1999. Watkins’ federal financial disclosure forms also don’t list VIAP as an asset but do show him earning income from Versar, under which he is listed as a consultant. According to the forms, he received $27,819 as earned income from the company in 2018 and $45,216 in 2017. The Star spoke with several Versar company officials who did not recall or remember Watkins. One Versar CEO from 2000 to 2010, Theodore M. Provic, told the paper he’s ""nobody that I’ve heard of."" Watkins actually joined the existing company as a contractor in 2004, according to company officials. Watkins did, in fact, work for VIAP in Afghanistan and Iraq during dangerous times and helped grow his outfit from a small team to hundreds, according to Brian Arbuckle, a former military colleague of Watkins. Arbuckle, who is is now vice president of engineering and construction management at Versar, sent a response to the Star at the request of the Watkins’ campaign. PolitiFact obtained a copy, which Arbuckle stressed is not an official statement from Versar. He confirmed that VIAP (which stands for Versar International Assistance Projects) was a newly developed name and business line that Versar created between 2004 and 2005, when Watkins joined the team. ""The name and organizational structure were new to Versar and were developed by a small team of professionals that set up and grew our business in conflict/post conflict environments,"" Arbuckle wrote. ""The initial core team included me, Steve Watkins, and three other leaders."" He said that Watkins started working for Versar in Iraq in 2004 where he and a small team started, developed and grew international operations under the name VIAP and led teams of hundreds of professionals that provided engineering and construction quality assurance services in the Middle East. Bryan Piligra, Watkins’ campaign spokesman said in an email that Watkins helped form a three-man engineering and security outfit to over 470 people operating in two war zones. ""Steve has said countless times to media and voters throughout the district that the firm was a wholly-owned subsidiary of a publicly traded, U.S. company,"" Piligra wrote. ""He helped start it and grow it, operationally. Prior to the involvement of Steve and two other individuals, it did not exist from an operational standpoint."" The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said Watkins’ lied to voters about building a company from scratch. We found that Watkins did not own or build the company, VIAP, from the ground up in the Middle East, as he claimed to voters in the past. He did, however, oversee and expand a small team into hundreds during his time in Iraq and Afghanistan under a new arm of Versar. Watkins did exaggerate his background with the company, but he did work there when it was growing. The DCCC says it was ""all a lie,"" but that’s an exaggeration, too.

Veterans group says Jim Hagedorn's health care positions would harm Minnesota veterans
","Like apple pie, some things are so sacred in American society that you mess with them at your peril. Senior citizens, for one. Veterans, for another. So look out, Jim Hagedorn, because a veterans’ political group says you’d do some messing if elected. Hagedorn is a Republican in southern Minnesota running for the seat held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Walz, who decided to run for the state’s governorship rather than seek reelection in its 1st Congressional District. VoteVets, a liberal-leaning group, says Hagedorn’s support for past congressional Republican health care proposals shows he backs ""a plan that rewards special interests while taking away health care for 340,000 veterans."" That’s a national number, but in Minnesota alone, ""17,000 veterans could lose their health coverage,"" VoteVets says in an ad. ""That’s a disgrace,"" says the announcer, who calls Hagedorn ""not fit to serve in Congress."" PolitiFact was unaware of any plan to cancel health coverage for veterans, but it sounded outrageous so we asked VoteVets, which explained its case. We also spoke with Hagedorn, who said the criticism shows ignorance of his and other Republicans’ ideas. We’ll explain. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs operates a nationwide system of hospitals and health centers. But ""contrary to claims concerning promises of ‘free health care for life,’ not every veteran is automatically entitled to medical care from the VA,"" said a Congressional Research Service report in 2016 that explained which veterans get care. ""Eligibility for VA health care is based primarily on veteran status resulting from military service."" VA has ""priority groups,"" which factor in such things as service-connected disabilities, prisoner of war status, Purple Heart or Medal of Honor honorees, and income. That leaves a lot of other veterans to get care from their employers, to buy it on their own or, if their incomes are low enough, to qualify for Medicaid, the federal-state program. As a result, about 1.75 million veterans across the country are on Medicaid, says Families USA, a liberal group supporting broad health care eligibility. Medicaid enrollment used to be limited to people with extremely low incomes -- the median state cap was 61 percent below the federal poverty level -- and it was difficult for childless, working-wage men to enroll because of other participation limits. The Affordable Care Act raised the income-eligibility level to 138 percent of poverty, or $16,753 for an individual today, and broadened the enrollment guidelines. But states had to agree to participate, because states have to pay a share of the costs. Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia ultimately decided to participate in this expansion and three more are considering it, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data as of Sept. 11, 2018. The federal share of money to pay for this new group of enrollees started at 100 percent but phases down to 90 percent by the year 2020, with states paying the rest. That’s a lot higher than the 57 percent, on average, that Washington paid for pre-expansion enrollees. About 340,000 veterans nationwide gained health coverage through this Medicaid expansion, a Families USA analysis said in May 2017. Counting all people enrolled in Medicaid, not just those in the expansion pool, 17,000 veterans in Minnesota get their health care paid for through the program, Families USA said. Republicans in Congress never liked Obamacare. They have tried ever since its passage in 2010 to repeal the law and, more recently, to replace certain parts. One idea popular among many Republicans in 2017 was to turn more authority over to states. But the funding formulas would change. A Republican House bill that passed on a partisan basis, the American Health Care Act of 2017, would have rolled back the ""enhanced federal matching rate"" of payments for Medicaid expansion starting in 2020, taking it from 90 percent to an average of 57 percent, with some fluctuation by state. States could still get the 90 percent federal match for any expansion enrollees still in the program at the time of the changeover. The House bill would also slow future Medicaid spending in general. A Senate bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act, would have set a per-person cap for Medicaid spending, limited the program’s funding growth and cut the federal share for expanded Medicaid to 57 percent on average by 2024. Lacking votes to advance, in part because some conservatives were not satisfied it adequately curbed the government’s role, the Senate bill died. These bills and similar ideas form the basis of the VoteVets claim. Hagedorn supported both bills in principle. Analysis by health policy analysts and the Congressional Budget Office said the current enrollees in Medicaid’s expansion would ultimately be dropped from enrollment. Among the reasons: People cycle on and off the Medicaid rolls as their incomes and circumstances change. That means that while the 90 percent federal funding match would have remained for continuous enrollment, fewer than one-third of these people would still be enrolled two years later, the Congressional Budget Office said in an analysis of the House bill, and 95 percent of them would be gone by the end of 2024. Once they left, states would lack the federal dollars to re-enroll them, health policy analysts said at the time. The other cuts and spending caps would add to this pressure. States would be faced with higher costs in general. Put all this together and, VoteVets and Families USA said, this could lead to the death of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. Some states ""would discontinue their expansion of eligibility, some states that would have expanded eligibility in the future would choose not to do so, and per-enrollee spending in the program would be capped,"" the Congressional Budget Office said in its March 2017 analysis of the House bill. As a result, there would be 14 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026, a reduction of about 17 percent, the CBO said. The numbers were different, but not by much, in the CBO’s analysis of the Senate bill.  ""By 2026, among people under age 65, enrollment in Medicaid"" -- all Medicaid, not just the ACA expansion pool -- ""would fall by about 16 percent,"" the nonpartisan analysts said. All Medicaid spending would be about 35 percent lower in 2036 compared with spending under the current trajectory, the CBO said. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is a liberal group, but health policy analysts last year agreed with a conclusion it made in its own report: The cost shifts would require states ""to come up with tens of billions more in annual funding from their own budgets in order to maintain their expansions. In practice, states very likely wouldn’t be able to absorb these additional costs."" Hagedorn told us in a telephone interview that VoteVets’ criticism was based entirely on speculation. ""It’s all ‘could, would, maybe,’"" he said. While true that states would have to make decisions, ""I’m sure we would do the right thing"" in Minnesota to make sure veterans were covered. Furthermore, he said, he would want to pass legislation in Congress to open the VA system to all veterans, and let them decide whether to get care at a VA center or from private doctors and hospitals. Hagedorn has a number of his positions on his campaign website, including giving ""block grant funding and authority of the Medicaid program to the states."" Finally, you might be wondering: Why on earth would congressional Republicans want to take away people’s health care? House and Senate Republicans said they didn’t and wouldn’t. Although their bills would roll back Medicaid, people losing Medicaid would qualify instead for subsidies with which to buy insurance -- even people with incomes below the poverty line, unlike the Obamacare subsidy system. Their form of insurance might change from Medicaid to an insurance carrier (with subsidies to pay premiums), but they’d still be able to get coverage. But the CBO and Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation said this would be inadequate for many. The GOP bills would let insurers cover fewer illnesses and conditions than under Obamacare, so people with some illnesses would have to pay more for care. Regardless of their coverages, the policies would require more out-of-pocket costs, whereas now, ""the vast majority of people enrolled in Medicaid pay no premiums and have either no out-of-pocket costs or nominal amounts of such costs,"" the CBO said in its analysis of the Senate bill. Because of ""the expense for premiums and the high deductibles,"" most people losing Medicaid ""would not purchase insurance,"" the CBO said. VoteVets said Hagedorn supports a plan that would take away ""health care for 340,000 veterans. In Minnesota alone, 17,000 veterans could lose their health coverage."" Hagedorn says that’s not true, in part because of his proposal for broader VA enrollment. It’s an interesting idea, but not on the verge of congressional consideration. Yet the Medicaid cuts have been on the verge of consideration -- and even got House approval -- for some time. PolitiFact examined a number of claims around last year’s discussions. When White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said the House plan ""doesn’t get rid of Medicaid expansion,"" PolitiFact called it Mostly False, explaining that with reduced federal funding, states would likely find continuing it unsustainable. When Rep. Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, said ""nobody on Medicaid"" would have benefits taken away, we ruled it False for similar reasons. And when the Senate considered the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, PolitiFact said a claim by Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida -- that ""there is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under Medicaid"" -- was Mostly False. There were other claims, and you can read them here.

Are Mike Braun's employees on the hook for first $10,000 of health care?
","Incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly painted himself as a guardian of health insurance and Republican opponent Mike Braun as its main threat during their first debate. ""I was the final vote to save health care,"" Donnelly said of his opposition to the so-called skinny repeal of the Affordable Care Act. ""At (Braun’s) company, the deductible on his health care if $10,000, which is completely unaffordable. He has every time tried to take away pre-existing conditions coverage and supports the lawsuit today that would do that."" Braun did not respond to the attack in the debate, but in his rebuttal he said he ""took on health care"" and ""held premiums for 10 years while covering pre-existing conditions."" We rated Mostly True an earlier claim from Donnelly that Braun supported ending coverage for pre-existing conditions. But when it comes to his business, Meyer Distributing, does Braun charge $10,000 deductibles? Meyer Distributing is an auto parts distribution company. According to Braun’s campaign, the company had 452 employees in Indiana as of April. The majority make between $10 and $17 an hour. The employee benefits enrollment guide from 2018 confirms family deductibles are $10,000, and $5,000 for individuals. The health plan is valid from March 1, 2018, to Feb. 28, 2019. We were unable to find any other health plans offered, and the Braun campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Meyer offers a high-deductible health plan. That means that health care costs are absorbed by the employee until they reach that set limit (of $5,000 or $10,000). Doctor’s office visits, prescriptions and emergency room visits are not covered until then. Preventive care costs, on the other hand, are fully covered regardless of whether the deductible has been met. Those include annual preventive physicals and tests, routine prenatal care, immunizations, and screening services. The individual deductible roughly doubles national averages, according to a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation published on Oct. 3. The 2018 average for individuals was $2,349 and $4,676 for families. Meyer’s plan is still within the limits set by the Affordable Care Act, which caps out-of-pocket costs at $7,350 for an individual plan and $14,700 for a family. Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that on average, employers that offer such plans contribute more than $1,000 to employees’ health savings accounts. We found no indication in the guide whether Meyer contributes or not. Premiums at Meyer, however, were lower than the national average. That’s the money employees pay for health care coverage with each paycheck, if enrolled. Workers pay $34.30 biweekly in premiums for individuals, or $198.44 for the employee, spouse and children, which translates to $891.80 and $5,159.44 a year, respectively. The national average worker contribution to the premium is $1,074 for individuals and $4,631 for families. Braun said he has held premiums steady for 10 years. Individual premiums are lower at Meyer than the national average dating back to 2010. Average premiums have been increasing each year, so keeping premiums steady for 10 years would be unusual, according to Pollitz. ""Firms have been moderating premium increases by shifting more costs to workers in the form of deductibles,"" Pollitz said. ""That’s a good deal for the worker as long as they don’t get sick, hurt or pregnant."" Donnelly said, ""At (Braun’s) company, the deductible on his health care is $10,000."" The high-deductible health plan Braun offered full-time employees in 2018 had deductibles of $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 for families.

Republican ad misleads in attack on Andrew Gillum about hurricane
","When Hurricane Hermine hit Florida in 2016, it knocked out power for several days in Tallahassee, igniting a political storm of tension between the capital city and state government. A new storm is brewing in the 2018 race for governor, with Democratic Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum under attack about allegations his administration didn’t cooperate with utility companies. ""After the Hurricane, we had no electricity for over a week,"" said a woman named Kathryn in a TV ad by the Republican Party of Florida. ""Utility companies lined up trucks to restore power. But as mayor, Andrew Gillum refused help from workers. The trucks just sat, while people suffered."" ""Incompetence, or extreme politics, I don't know,"" she says. ""But leaders are supposed to help people in tough times. And Andrew Gillum, he didn't help us. He failed us."" A second TV ad by the party said, ""Gillum turned away workers who could have restored our power."" Gillum’s Republican opponent, Ron DeSantis, has also criticized Gillum’s leadership during the hurricane. This ad distorts the city’s response to the massive power outage. The city accepted help from several utilities, although it turned down an offer of help from Florida Power and Light, the Florida utility giant. After Hurricane Hermine hit Sept. 1, 2016, more than 75,000 customers of the city's municipal electric system and 20,000 customers of the nearby cooperative electric company, Talquin Electric, lost power. Power was restored to 90 percent of homes within five days. After the storm hit, Gov. Rick Scott held meetings with government officials, and utility executives including Eric Silagy, Florida Power and Light CEO. Silagy said he had 575 personnel ready to help. But Rob McGarrah, the city’s general manager of utilities, was confident the city had engaged enough assistance from eight other utilities, the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald reported after the storm. He did not immediately jump on the offer by FPL and told Scott that coordination with the visiting crews was important to ""make sure what we're doing is safe."" City spokeswoman Alison Faris told PolitiFact that at the time FPL’s offer was extended, the city had already accepted all the assistance it could safely utilize. Barry Moline was the head of the Florida Municipal Electrical Association at the time. He said it was McGarrah’s responsibility to identify the needs while Moline was in charge of coordinating with other utilities. ""Any claim that suggests the mayor had anything to do with rejecting crews is a flat-out lie,"" Moline, who now serves as executive director of the California Municipal Utilities Association, told the Sun Sentinel. ""It's wrong. It's false. It didn't happen. The mayor wasn't involved with selecting or choosing crews to bring into Tallahassee."" A few weeks after the storm, the Tallahassee Democrat wrote that Moline and others said ""Mayor Gillum had until 10 p.m. to accept the workers parked 90 minutes away in Lake City or they'd move up the coast."" But Moline told PolitiFact that it was up to McGarrah, not Gillum, about whether to accept help from various utilities. When responding to a disaster, the mayor and city commissioners look to McGarrah as the expert, Moline said. Moline said at the time FPL was offering ""resources"" but ""they refused to divulge what FPL resources meant"" in terms of the type of workers. Moline said it's important to know what type of workers a utility is offering to provide because workers have different skills. FPL media relations didn’t respond to requests for comment. The images of utility trucks in the ad were from FPL staging areas in Valdosta, Ga., and Flagler, on Florida’s east coast. The names of the company on the trucks were blurred in the ad ""because it was a political ad and the name of the utility company was not relevant, the fact that they were staged and ready and not allowed to help is,"" said Meredith Beatrice, spokeswoman for the Republican Party of Florida. On Sept. 4, Gulf Power sent 150 workers to Leon County. Days after the storm, city officials said they accepted all the help they could. McGarrah explained he had to embed his own people in outside crews for safety reasons and that the city had reached a ""saturation point"" with mutual-aid crews. ""It starts to get to the point where more bodies don't necessarily equate to ... more productivity,"" he said. ""You can only get so many line trucks, bucket trucks and people in an area."" Several news articles following the storm, as well as a report by Leon County, show that the city did accept help from many other utilities. Leon County’s report said that the city of Tallahassee Utilities and Talquin Electric both have mutual-aid agreements to obtain equipment and labor from other utilities following disasters. A total of 198 line crews and staff from nine utilities assisted with restoration efforts. Crews arrived in Leon County by midday on Friday, Sept. 2, and assisted until Sept. 11, the county report said. City residents complained on social media about the pace of restoration after word spread that the city turned down help from Florida Power and Light. Three days after the storm hit, Gillum defended the city’s response on Facebook. ""Let me be clear. We are happy to accept any help from any person or organization that is going to accelerate the speed at which we can safely restore power to our residents. ... We have accepted help from eight different utility companies from three different states offering assistance with power restoration."" Gillum warned ""too much help at one time may make us feel better, but it can actually slow down progress."" Gillum, however, acknowledged the city could do better at updating planning protocols. Moline told the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald that while Gillum was at the meetings about storm response, Tallahassee isn’t a ""strong mayor"" form of government and Gillum ""had zero input into the decisions to get more resources or fewer resources."" Beatrice, the Republican Party spokeswoman, pushed back on that assessment. ""He was at those meetings where decisions were made, and he had ‘zero input,’ which is unacceptable leadership,"" she said. ""The blame still falls on him for not speaking up. Doing nothing and shifting blame to subordinates is awful leadership."" Alan Harris, chief administrator for the Seminole County Office of Emergency Management, told PolitiFact that it sounded like the city followed the mutual-aid agreement in place.   ""The elected officials do not get involved with the agreements accept to approve them at a board meeting,"" he told PolitiFact. Typically, he said, tactical decisions are left in the hands of a department manager, not a mayor or elected official. Chuck Lanza, a former Broward County emergency management director, said the role of the mayor can depend on the mayor and the situation -- not necessarily the form of government. ""Yes, Tallahassee Mayor Gillum is not a ‘strong mayor,’ as the city has implemented the City Manager model for day-to-day governance,"" Lanza said. ""Having said that, I would not be surprised to see any mayor become the face and voice of the city during a threat and in the subsequent response and recovery. The dynamics are not always documented but the mayor’s power may increase due to the nature of the event. In the old days, the mayor of Miami Beach would have a very visible role in a hurricane response and was successful in making decisions in conflict with the county who had the legal authority to make the decisions."" The Republican Party of Florida said after a hurricane struck Tallahassee, ""utility companies lined up trucks to restore power. But as mayor, Andrew Gillum refused help from workers."" The city of Tallahassee turned down an offer from Florida Power and Light to help restore power to residents after Hurricane Hermine in 2016. In Tallahassee, the mayor isn’t the chief executive of the city like he or she would be in New York, Boston or Tampa. So in the case of storm response, decisions didn’t ultimately fall to Gillum. They were made by the city’s general manager of utilities. Despite what the ad claims, the city accepted help from multiple outside utility companies to help restore power in Tallahassee. The claim from the Republican Party of Florida has only an element of truth but distorts the facts to give viewers the wrong impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.","[('Republican Party of Florida, ""Unfit to lead"" 1 TV ad and ""Unfit to lead"" 2 TV ad, Oct. 4, 2018', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAA4fotHcoU&feature=youtu.be'), ('Leon County Board of County Commissioners, Workshop on the Hurricane Hermine After Action Report, Dec. 13, 2016', 'No link'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""Hurricane politics: When Andrew Gillum and Rick Scott clashed,"" Sept. 17, 2018', 'http://www2.leoncountyfl.gov/coadmin/agenda/Workshops/ws120161213.pdf'), ('Miami Herald, ""A few days without power put city on edge, and governor, mayor at odds,"" Sept. 9, 2016', 'No link'), ('Sunshine State News, ""Utility Workers Still \'Standing Around\' Waiting for OK to Begin Power Work in Tallahassee,"" Sept. 7, 2016', 'http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/09/17/hurricane-politics-when-andrew-gillum-and-rick-scott-clashed/'), ('Florida Politics, ""Power companies’ offers of help to restore power in Tallahassee have been rebuffed,"" Sept. 4, 2016', 'No link'), ('Tallahassee Democrat, ""Lawsuit: City played favorites in Hermine power restoration,"" Nov. 11, 2017', 'https://www.bradenton.com/news/politics-government/article100879817.html'), ('Florida Politics, ""Power companies’ offers of help to restore power in Tallahassee have been rebuffed,"" Nov. 11, 2017', 'No link'), ('Politico, ""A tale of two hurricanes: Scott\'s different responses to power outages,"" Oct. 11, 2016', 'http://sunshinestatenews.com/story/utility-workers-still-standing-around-waiting-ok-begin-power-work-tallahassee'), ('Sun Sentinel, ""Hurricane leadership: Are Ron DeSantis, Andrew Gillum ready if disaster strikes?""

"['Legal Issues', 'Crime', 'California', 'Gavin Newsom']","
Are U.S., Philippines the only two countries with money bail?
","Democrat Gavin Newsom touted a new state law that ends monetary bail during the Oct. 8 California gubernatorial debate. The bill, which outgoing Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed in August, emerged after years of complaints that the money bail system is punitive for low-income Americans, in some cases making those who cannot afford their share of the bail wait for months behind bars for minor violations or for crimes they are ultimately cleared of. Instead, the bill would enact a system of ""risk assessments"" that sets out non-monetary conditions for release. (As is the case currently, the highest-risk arrestees would be remanded into custody without bail.) To Newsom, the law is a first step toward correcting a national blemish. Referring to President Donald Trump and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, Newsom said, ""Only Duterte’s Philippines and Trump’s United States of America have money bail. California became the first state to step up and step into this debate and do the right thing."" When we looked into Newsom’s assertion, we found that he was largely correct, though with some caveats required. The focus on the United States and the Philippines as outliers internationally in bail policy dates back to at least 1991, when a University of Southern Mississippi professor, F.E. Devine, wrote a study titled, ""Commercial Bail Bonding: A Comparison of Common Law Alternatives."" (Devine died in 2011.) Referring to commercial bail bond companies, Devine wrote that ""with the exception of the Philippines and an ambiguous provision in Liberia, which does not seem to result in any important commercialization of bail, these companies do not exist outside of the United States."" He continued, ""The Philippines exhibits the only bail system outside the United States dominated by commercial provision of bail."" Three experts with a specialty in bail bonds said that Devine’s singling out of the two countries still stands, though they added that Newsom could have been more careful in his wording. Other countries do require monetary deposit for pretrial release in at least some cases, said Megan Stevenson, an assistant professor of law at George Mason University. ""For instance, I know cash bail is sometimes used in Canada,"" though its use is much more limited, Stevenson said. A more accurate way to phrase it, she said, would be to say that ""only the U.S. and Philippines have a cash bail system that is dominated by commercial bail bondsmen."" This makes a difference because a commercial bail industry has a financial stake in the system. Shima Baradaran Baughman, a law professor at the University of Utah, said that she referred to the same two countries as outliers in her 2017 volume, ""The Bail Book."" Asked whether she agreed with Stevenson’s clarification about commercial bail bonding companies being the important distinction, she said she did. Tim Schnacke, executive director of the Colorado-based Center for Legal and Evidence-Based Practices, agreed. ""I've tried to correct people when they say it the way (Newsom said it) but it just keeps finding legs,"" Schnacke said. The other asterisk we would place on Newsom’s assertion is his invocation of Trump and Duterte. As Devine’s book makes clear, the cash bail policies of the United States and the Philippines predated the Trump and Duterte presidencies by decades. Newsom said, ""Only Duterte’s Philippines and and Trump’s United States of America have money bail."" These two countries are international outliers on bail policy, but Newsom would have been more accurate if he’d specified the role of commercial bail providers, rather than ""money bail"" more generally. In addition, his references to Trump and Duterte are gratuitous, since the policies were well-established for decades before they took office. We rate the statement Mostly True.","[('Gavin Newsom, remarks at a gubernatorial debate, Oct. 8, 2018', 'http://www.capradio.org/news/special/california-gubernatorial-debate/2018/10/08/2018-california-governors-debate/'), ('By F.

Ad accuses Andy Barr of allowing payday lenders to take advantage of military families
","The ""cross-partisan"" group With Honor, which formed to support military veterans running for Congress, has backed Democratic challenger and Marine veteran Amy McGrath. McGrath is running against Republican incumbent Andy Barr for the U.S. House seat in central Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District. The September ad lambastes Barr’s support of the payday lending business. The ad says that Barr has accepted campaign donations from payday lending organizations and that he would let them take advantage of service members and their families. ""In Kentucky, we respect our troops, but Congressman Andy Barr would let shady payday lenders take advantage of them,"" the ad says. It goes on to say that he took ""$36,550 from payday lenders, then let them stick our troops with outrageous fees. It’s what’s wrong with Congress."" It is no secret that payday lenders routinely sock consumers with excessively high charges and fees. But did Barr ""let them"" stick military families with outrageous fees, while also taking money from them for his campaign? Yes and no. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, ""payday loans are small-dollar, short-term, unsecured loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck or regular income payment."" Payday loans often include very high interest rates or fees. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, formed under President Barack Obama through the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, launched the nation's first program for supervising ""non-bank"" financial services, which include payday loan providers, as well as debt collectors, mortgage companies and credit-score companies. At issue is Barr’s 2017 vote for the Financial CHOICE Act, which passed the House but failed in the Senate. Barr was one of seven original cosponsors of the bill. The bill would make sweeping changes and repeal provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, in part by weakening the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the plan, the agency would lose its oversight of payday lenders. There is a line in the legislation that says, ""the agency may not exercise any rulemaking, enforcement, or other authority with respect to payday loans, vehicle title loans, or other similar loans.’’ With Honor spokeswoman Ellen Zeng also pointed to a June 2017 Military.com article that grappled with whether the bill would undo certain protections for active and retired service members and their families. The bureau has played a major role in ""providing restitution and help to troops taken advantage of by illegal financial practices,"" the article states. One program, in the bureau's Office of Servicemember Affairs department, has fielded over 74,000 complaints about predatory financial practices from the military community since 2011, a 2017 CFPB report says, resulting in more than $130 million in relief to affected service members. Barr’s campaign released a statement after the ad aired calling it misleading. There are existing laws that protect military families from payday lenders, the campaign said. The 2006 Military Lending Act put a 36 percent cap on the amount of interest small-dollar lenders could charge on loans to military families. When veterans groups raised concerns about the Financial CHOICE Act, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who sponsored the bill and chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said it would not touch protections for veterans. ""The Financial Choice Act does not weaken the laws that specifically protect active-duty and retired members of our armed forces,"" he said in a June 2017 statement. Zeng says the group stands by the ad, as the bill would have drained the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she says plays a vital role in protecting military veterans and their families from predatory payday lenders. This part is pretty straight-forward. Yes, he did. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, an authoritative database of campaign finance data, Barr has accepted $36,550 from PACs and individuals associated with the payday lending industry since his 2014 campaign. He has received $7,500 from payday lenders in 2018. With Honor says Barr ""would let shady payday lenders take advantage of our troops"" and that he received $36,550 in campaign donations from payday lenders. It is true that Bar has accepted $36,550 in donations from payday lenders. But the other part is more complicated. Barr voted for legislation that would weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s power over payday lending agencies, which could indirectly affect military families as the agency fields complaints from the community. However, a 2006 law provides servicemembers protection, with a 36 percent cap on the interest small-dollar lenders could charge families. So while the CFPB could have provided more protections to the military community than the 2006 law, the ad makes it appear as if Barr’s actions were connected to legislation specifically about veterans. We rate it Half True.","[('With Honor TV ad, Sept. 10, 2018', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVUcSDChtOc&feature=youtu.be'), ('PolitiFact, "" After long wait, new agency takes up role overseeing payday loans,"" Accessed Oct. 8, 2018', 'No link'), ('H.R.10 ""Financial CHOICE Act of 2017,"" Accessed Oct. 8, 2018;', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/323/cap-interest-rates-on-payday-loans-and-improve-dis/'), ('Congress.Gov, ""https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20170605/BILLS-115HR10-HAmdt.pdf,"" May 25, 2017', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""How House Bill Would Dismantle an Array of Dodd-Frank Reforms,"" June 8, 2017', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/10/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22CHOICE+act%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1'), ('Military.com, ""Major Financial Bill May Eliminate Some Troop Protections,"" Accessed Oct. 8, 2018', 'No link'), ('Center for Responsible Lending, ""Summary: The Military Lending Act of 2006,"" Accessed Oct. 8, 2018', 'https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20170605/BILLS-115HR10-HAmdt.pdf'), ('Lexington Herald-Leader, ""Barr demands TV stations take down attack ad by veterans group supporting McGrath"" Sept. 13, 2018', 'No link'), ('Center for Responsive Politics, ""Payday Lenders: Money to Congress,"" Accessed Oct. 8, 2018', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/business/dealbook/how-house-bill-would-dismantle-an-array-of-dodd-frank-reforms.html'), ('Email interview with Ellen Zeng, spokesperson, With Honor, Oct. 8, 2018', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2018/oct/09/With_Honor/ad-accuses-andy-barr-allowing-payday-lenders-take-/

Taylor Swift: Marsha Blackburn voted against reauthorizing Violence Against Women Act
","Pop star Taylor Swift jumped into the rough and tumble of politics with a rebuke of Tennessee Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn and an endorsement of Democrat Phil Bredesen. In a long Instagram post, Swift explained that her concern over matters of gender orientation and racism drove her to speak out. ""I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love,"" Swift said.  I’m writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I’ll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent. I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway. So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info. Happy Voting! 🗳😃🌈 A post shared by  Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Oct 7, 2018 at 4:33pm PDT Blackburn, Swift said, ""terrifies"" her. ""She voted against equal pay for women,"" Swift wrote. ""She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape."" Here, we look at whether Blackburn in fact voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Blackburn did vote against the bill, but she voted in favor of a Republican alternative. The differences were not great, but they hung on the very issue of gender orientation that Swift wrote about. The Violence Against Women Act was two decades old in 2013 when Congress wrestled with renewing the funds to support it. The law paid for programs to prevent domestic violence. It provided money to investigate and prosecute rape and other crimes against women. It supported counseling for victims. The $630 million price tag was less the problem than some specific language on non-discrimination. The Senate approved its bill first on Feb. 12, 2013, by a wide bipartisan margin of 78 to 22. That measure redefined underserved populations to include those who might be discriminated against based on religion, sexual orientation or gender identity. There were also changes in the recognition of the authority of Native American tribes to enforce the law within the tribal justice system. When the bill came over to the House, a key sticking point had to do with orientation and identity. House Republicans crafted a version of the legislation that omitted the sexual orientation and gender protections. The American Bar Association opposed the GOP version, saying ""the House substitute eliminates certain critical improvements."" Domestic violence shelters in some southern states said they had heard from governors’ offices that they couldn’t use federal funds for LGBTQ victims because the law didn’t explicitly say they were covered. ""You show up bleeding at the door and we’re going to address the bleeding, not stop to ask about your sexual orientation or gender identity first,"" said Ruth Glenn, CEO of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. ""We didn’t want programs to lose their funding because they didn’t do triage on that basis."" The House Republican version failed by a vote of 166 to 257. The nay votes included 60 Republicans. Blackburn voted in favor of the Republican measure. The Senate version, the one that ultimately became law, came up next and passed 286 to 138. The bill had picked up 27 additional Republican votes. Blackburn voted no. We reached out to Blackburn’s office for comment and did not hear back. Swift said Blackburn voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Blackburn voted no on the final version that became law. She did vote for a Republican alternative that lacked discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. While there were other issues, over two dozen Republicans decided that it was better to fund the act than to continue to oppose the nondiscrimination provisions. Blackburn was not one of them. We rate the claim Mostly True.","[('Taylor Swift, Instagram, Oct. 7, 2018', 'https://www.instagram.com/p/BopoXpYnCes/?hl=en'), ('U.S. Congress, Republican amendment, Feb. 28, 2013', 'No link'), ('U.S. Congress, S.47 - Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, Jan. 22, 2013', 'https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwiJbAWhwPe_REZObW01UFBMVmc4cUJNTk9HVVhCdWVNM3d3'), ('U.S. Congress, Congressional record, Feb. 28, 2013', 'No link'), ('American Bar Association, Letter, Feb. 27, 2013', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/47/'), ('New York Times, House Renews Violence Against Women Measure, Feb. 28, 2013', 'No link'), ('Congressional Research Service, The Violence Against Women Act: Overview, Legislation, and Federal Funding , May 26, 2015', 'https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/2/28/house-section/article/h707-1?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Violence+against+women%22%7D&r=1'), ('The Atlantic, Why Would Anyone Oppose the Violence Against Women Act?, Feb. 12, 2013', 'No link'), (""USA Today, What about her reputation?

An age claim in New Jersey leaves out something important about New Jersey
","Older people vote, and Tom Malinowski, the Democratic challenger in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District, seems to have them in mind. In a television ad criticizing incumbent U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance, Malinowski says Lance voted more than 60 times ""to gut affordable health care."" These votes included provisions to let insurers deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, and ""to let insurance companies charge more to people aged 50 and over."" This is all about the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare. The last part of the claim by Malinowski, a former U.S. State Department official, intrigued us because of a unique aspect of a New Jersey law in effect before the Obamacare was passed. It already limited how much more insurers could charge their oldest customers based on age. Those differences, however, were not quite as narrow as required by Obamacare. But let’s dispense quickly with something else first. When Malinowski says Lance, a Republican, voted more than 60 times to gut affordable health care, he is speaking of the array of votes in Congress between 2011 and 2017 concerning the federal law, passed by Democrats in Congress in 2010. Some of the votes were to fully repeal the health law. Some were to delay its implementation. Some were to eliminate or stall tax provisions within it -- to delay the IRS’ ability to penalize taxpayers who refused to get health coverage, for example, or to stop the planned taxes on durable medical equipment sales. The tax was one of the many ways the law was paid for. Lance did not go along with his party on one of its biggest, most recent bills. He voted against a repeal-and-replace measure in 2017. He said it would not adequately protect people with pre-existing conditions. But what about the age differential -- and what did it mean in New Jersey, specifically? We took a look. Older people go to the doctor more than young adults do. That’s a reality that affects the premiums insurers charge. As a result, insurers typically charged their oldest customers buying individual policies five times or more the premiums of their youngest adult customers before the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, according to a 2017 research report by the actuarial firm Milliman. Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms found that people in their early 60s could face a ratio of 6-to-1, Milliman’s report noted. The ACA changed that, mandating that in the individual market, premiums for the oldest adults could be no greater than three times those for the youngest. This didn’t affect large employer plans, which tend to have a range of ages that balance out big price differences anyway, and it didn’t apply to Medicare, the federal program for people 65 and older. But in the individual market, it held down what would have been higher prices for the oldest buyers, while raising premiums for younger buyers. Other mechanisms in the act, particularly taxpayer subsidies to reduce out-of-pocket costs, helped temper some price changes. It bears noting that the ACA does not say a thing about the age of 50, as Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, confirmed to us. The law just refers to youngest-vs.-oldest adults. But political campaigns like to use specific ages, and 50 seems to have a meaningful resonance for voters. So what would happen if Congress got rid of the ACA? Multiple analyses say younger buyers would see premium reductions while older ones would see price spikes. This could be particularly true if older customers lost one of the ACA’s other protections, a prohibition on basing premiums on medical conditions. Lance cited that concern when voting against the 2017 American Health Care Act, although he had voted for other repeal variations before then. So it’s cut and dried, right? Not quite. States used to have significant sway in how they regulated insurers, and New Jersey already limited premiums based on age. While the national average ratio of premiums for young adults to older ones was 5-to-1 or greater, New Jersey law in 2009 limited age differences to 3.5-to-1. Mathematically, that’s 17 percent higher for the oldest customers than allowed under the ACA (which allows a rate discrepancy of 3-to-1). That’s not as high as rates might be if New Jersey had no cap on age differences, but it nevertheless could amount to hundreds of dollars a month, said Benji Schwartz, Malinowski’s campaign spokesman. It is hard to determine exactly how high or low rates would be for Lance’s constituents even with a 3.5-to-1 age ratio -- that is, even if older customers could be charged 17 percent more than younger customers -- because age was just one of the pre- and post-ACA pricing factors, Joel Cantor, director of the Center for State Health Policy at Rutgers University, told us. Other variables went into the mix. But when the ACA kicked in, ""most people saw major reductions,"" Cantor said. ""As we say, run the movie backwards and people would be hit with major premium increases,"" Cantor said. Malinowski’s ad said that Lance voted repeatedly ""to let insurance companies charge more to people aged 50 and over."" The ad contains elements of truth but leaves out important facts: The ACA already allows insurance companies to charge older customers more — just not as much more as they did before. New Jersey limited those differences already, just not as much as the ACA. The congressional bills to change or eliminate the ACA would not have affected people on employer plans or Medicare. These factors matter. We rate the claim Half True.","[('""60 Times,"" Malinowski for Congress ad', 'https://malinowskifornj.com/press/2018/10/3/malinowski-releases-60-times'), ('Email and telephone conversations with Benji Schwartz, Malinowski campaign spokesman, Oct. 5 and 8, 2018', 'No link'), ('Telephone conversations with Joe Cantor, Center for State Health Policy, Rutgers University, Oct. 8, 2018', 'http://us.milliman.com/uploadedFiles/insight/2017/MillimanACAAgeBands_0131_Final.pdf'), ('Telephone conversation with Karen Pollitz, Kaiser Family Foundation, Oct, 8, 2018', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2018/oct/09/tom-malinowski/age-claim-new-jersey-leaves-out-something-importan/

Fact-checking Gavin Newsom’s record ‘solving’ homelessness in San Francisco
","During his run for California governor, Republican John Cox has tried to tie Democrat Gavin Newsom to the state’s growing homeless problem. In Cox’s latest radio campaign ad, a narrator even uses ""Newsomville"" to describe the state’s homeless camps ""springing up in every town."" At Monday’s gubernatorial debate, Cox attacked Newsom over San Francisco’s struggle with this human crisis. ""Gavin was mayor (of San Francisco) for eight years. He didn’t solve the homeless problem here at all. And it’s gotten worse."" We wanted to know whether Cox was right. Did Newsom really fail to ""solve the problem at all""? And has it ""gotten worse""? We set out on a fact check. Our research Newsom was San Francisco’s mayor from January 2004 to January 2011. He has served as the state’s lieutenant governor for the past seven-plus years. Few big city mayors in the United States, if any, have completely solved homelessness during their tenures. For his part, Newsom has often pointed to his role in cutting San Francisco’s ""street population by 40 percent"" during his time as mayor, adding his administration ""got 12,000 people off the street."" His campaign has cited the 2009 San Francisco Homeless Count and Survey to support that statement. We examined that claim in May and rated it Half True. We found Newsom cherry-picked the timeframe of this reduction, which took place from 2002 to 2009, two years before he became mayor to two years before he left that office. The street population went back up by 400 during his final two years. But even considering that uptick, the city’s unsheltered total still decreased by 31 percent from 2002 to 2011 RELATED: Fact check round-up of California governor's debate Tracking San Francisco's overall homeless population We also noted that Newsom’s statement does not reflect the slight increase in San Francisco’s overall homeless population during his time as mayor. The first available report during his tenure, from January 2005, shows a total of 6,248. By January 2011, Newsom’s final month in office, that number was 6,455. San Francisco’s most recent overall count, from June 2017, places the total at 7,499. That’s 1,044 higher than Newsom’s final month as mayor, and generally supports the last portion of Cox’s statement that the problem has ""gotten worse.""    Newsom credited as leader While the homeless crisis continues in San Francisco, Newsom has been credited as a leader on the topic. A 2010 San Francisco Chronicle article said Newsom had ""moved more homeless people into supportive housing in his seven years in office than any other mayor in the city's history - and has one of the best track records of any mayor in the country on that score."" Newsom’s campaign pointed a 2016 Chronicle investigation Beyond Homelessness, which examined the city’s response to the issue over the past two decades. Here’s what the newspaper found: ""Gavin Newsom, took the most aggressive stance yet toward tackling the issue. In 2004, he announced a 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness. While it failed to reach that goal, it did result in moving 22,000 homeless people off the streets either into housing or onto buses headed home. And in the past few years, the majority of the city’s indigent military veterans — many suffering post-traumatic stress from as far back as the 1970s — have been moved indoors, thanks in part to a national effort led by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. And yet the city’s streets look the same today. ""There’s a mythology that you can, quote unquote, end homelessness at any moment,"" Newsom said in 2014.  ""But there are new people coming in, suffering through the cycles of their lives. It’s the manifestation of complete, abject failure as a society. We’ll never solve this at City Hall."" The city’s bus ticket program, Homeward Bound, which accounts for sending thousands of homeless out of San Francisco, has been criticized by some homeless advocacy groups as simply moving the problem elsewhere. Asked to support Cox’s claim, his spokesman responded in an email: ""Wait, is there not a homeless problem in SF?"" Our ruling Republican John Cox claimed Gavin Newsom ""didn’t solve the homeless problem"" in San Francisco ""at all,"" adding ""it’s gotten worse."" Under Newsom’s administration, San Francisco’s homeless street population fell by 31 percent, from 2002 to 2011. Newsom has been credited with taking an aggressive stance on the topic and for helping move thousands off the street into housing or onto buses. The overall sheltered and unsheltered homeless population, however, rose slightly during Newsom’s tenure, and has increased since he left office by more than 1,000, supporting the second part of Cox’s statement.   But the first part of his claim, that Newsom didn’t solve the problem ""at all,"" ignores his accomplishments. While homelessness didn’t end on Newsom’s watch, he made steps considered unprecedented for the city. We rate Cox’s statement Half True.

Does Leah Vukmir support letting insurers deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions?
","Ahead of the Nov. 6, 2018 election for a Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat, Democratic incumbent Tammy Baldwin has been hitting Republican challenger Leah Vukmir for months on a key issue: Insurance coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. One attack comes in a TV ad released Sept. 20, 2018. Using a nurse who had breast cancer as the speaker, Baldwin makes a two-part claim: 2.4 million Wisconsin residents have a pre-existing condition Vukmir supports letting insurance companies ""deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions"" Vukmir took the unusual step of rebutting the ad by posting a letter to the nurse on Twitter. All of this is tied to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and its prohibition on insurers denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions  — something that is threatened by Republican efforts, which are supported by Vukmir, to repeal the law. So, let’s check both parts of Baldwin’s claim. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. The higher the number it is that Baldwin chooses is significant, because it would mean that many more people are potentially vulnerable if the second part of her claim is true. One of the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act is its requirement that insurers cover people with pre-existing conditions. That is, if you don’t have health insurance from an employer or the government, you have guaranteed access to insurance in the individual market, regardless of your health, and you can’t be charged higher rates for a pre-existing condition. Before Obamacare, insurers typically used medical underwriting  — evaluating the health status, health history and other risk factors of an applicant — to determine whether to deny a person coverage. Even for people they did accept, insurers could carve out coverage of any specific pre-existing conditions, as well as charge people with health problems higher premiums. To back Baldwin’s 2.4 million people figure, her campaign pointed us to an estimate by the Center for American Progress, a progressive public policy research and advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C. But this is a broad count. It includes not only people who could be denied insurance coverage  — which is what Baldwin highlights in the TV ad — but also people who could buy coverage but be charged more because of a pre-existing condition. In contrast, the latest estimate by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, one of the gold-standard sources on health care, is based on the number of people in Wisconsin who had health conditions that likely would have left them uninsurable before the Affordable Care Act. That estimate is much smaller: 852,000. So, there is a basis for Baldwin’s 2.4 million figure. But it’s misleadingly high in the context of the second part of her statement. It is worth noting, that if the Affordable Care Act were repealed, it’s possible premiums for some people with pre-existing conditions could be so high as to make insurance virtually unaffordable. Vukmir has not specifically said that insurers should be able to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, and she has said people with pre-existing conditions should be covered. But she has been vague on how that would happen. She has proposed ""allowing insurers to offer a wider variety of plans"" and enabling people to buy insurance across state lines. When Baldwin’s ad says Vukmir supports letting insurance companies ""deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions,"" a footnote on the screen refers to three news stories, but only one that mentions Vukmir. That story, by the Wisconsin State Journal, reported how Vukmir wants to fully repeal Obamacare  — which would mean also eliminating its guarantee against insurers denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. The story also notes that Vukmir has supported GOP repeal bills in Congress that would weaken protections for people with pre-existing conditions. For example, she praised the GOP’s American Health Care Act. It would have kept the requirement that people with pre-existing conditions must be offered health insurance -- but it would have dropped Obamacare’s rules capping how much extra those people could be charged. And the story reports that Vukmir supports returning to what Wisconsin offered before Obamacare — a publicly-subsidized high-risk pool for people with pre-existing conditions who couldn’t get insurance. Wisconsin’s high-risk pool was held up as something as a model, at least for the people it covered. But it worked only for people who could afford the insurance in the first place  — and many people with pre-existing conditions could not afford coverage from the high-risk pool, as it covered fewer than 25,000 people. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. In responding to Baldwin’s TV ad, Vukmir’s campaign pointed to a news release it issued in which Vukmir alludes to the high-risk pools, saying Wisconsin ""had solutions for those with pre-existing conditions before it was cool to take care of people with pre-existing conditions."" But the release didn’t offer more specifics on how they would be covered. Wisconsin’s high-risk pool existed specifically because insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Moreover, the pool, unlike Obamacare, did not provide coverage for everyone who couldn’t get coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Baldwin said ""2.4 million people in Wisconsin have pre-existing conditions"" and Vukmir supports letting insurance companies ""deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions."" There is some basis for the first part of Baldwin’s statement. One estimate puts the number of at 2.4 million — but those that could be denied health insurance coverage because of a condition is estimated to be much smaller, 852,000. On the second part of Baldwin’s statement, Vukmir has indicated that high-risk pools are a solution for covering people with pre-existing conditions. But those were in place because -- before the Affordable Care Act, which Vukmir wants to repeal -- insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. And Wisconsin’s high-risk pool covered only a fraction of people with pre-existing conditions. That being said, Vukmir has not specifically said she supports allowing insurers to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, and she has said those should be covered  — even if she has been vague about how that would happen. For a statement that is partially accurate, we give Baldwin a Half True.","[('YouTube, Tammy Baldwin ""Both sides"" TV ad, Sept. 20, 2018', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzcfbrqeOcs&feature=youtu.be'), ('Interview, Leah Vukmir campaign spokesman Jahan Wilcox, Oct. 8, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email, Tammy Baldwin campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt, Oct. 4, 2018', 'https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/04/05/430059/number-americans-pre-existing-conditions-congressional-district/'), ('Center for American Progress, ""Number of Americans with Pre-Existing Conditions by Congressional District,"" April 5, 2017', 'No link'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Covering people with pre-existing conditions is popular, problematic,"" May 29, 2017', 'https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/health-care/2017/05/29/covering-people-pre-existing-conditions-popular-and-problematic/345384001/'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Fates of some people with pre-existing conditions uncertain if Affordable Care Act is suspended,"" Sept. 20, 2018', 'No link'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Wisconsin U.S. Senate race: Tammy Baldwin, Leah Vukmir clash on health care,"" Sept. 4, 2018', 'https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/health-care/2018/09/20/walker-gives-no-detail-how-state-would-ensure-pre-existing-coverage/1352512002/'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, ""Mapping Pre-existing Conditions across the U.S,"" Aug. 28, 2018', 'No link'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, ""High-Risk Pools For Uninsurable Individuals,"" Feb. 22, 2017', 'https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/09/04/senate-race-tammy-baldwin-leah-vukmir-clash-health-care/1157442002/'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, ""Pre-existing Conditions and Medical Underwriting in the Individual Insurance Market Prior to the ACA,"" Dec. 12, 2016', 'No link'), ('Wisconsin State Journal, ""There may be no US Senate race with a starker contrast on health care than in Wisconsin,"" Aug. 27, 2018', 'https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/mapping-pre-existing-conditions-across-the-u-s/'), ('National Public Radio, ""Under New Rules, Cheaper \'Short-Term\' Health Care Plans Now Last Up To 3 Years,"" Aug. 1, 2018', 'No link'), ('Vox, ""How Cassidy-Graham brings back pre-existing conditions,"" Sept. 18, 2017', 'https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/high-risk-pools-for-uninsurable-individuals/'), ('Leah Vukmir campaign website, ""Repeal Obamacare,"" accessed Oct. 4, 2018', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact North Carolina, ""Does new version of the AHCA protect coverage for pre-existing conditions?""
