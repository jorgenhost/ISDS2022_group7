McCaskill doesn't account for all refugee cases
","During a January debate regarding Rex Tillerson’s nomination to U.S. Secretary of State, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, spoke out against what she claimed to be ""misinformation"" coming out of the White House on refugees looking to enter the United States. McCaskill addressed the extreme vetting process refugees entering the United States had to undergo even before the ban introduced by Donald Trump on Jan. 27, which temporarily blocked refugees from seven majority-Muslim countries. To reach the United States, she said, refugees must first go through international powers. ""Let me first start with this important principle: Nobody applies to the United States for refugee status. They apply to the United Nations,"" McCaskill said. We decided to verify this claim. Do all people seeking refugee status have to go through the United Nations first? Refugee status vs. refugee resettlement First a bit of context. McCaskill talked about getting ""refugee status,"" but it seems evident she is speaking about permanent resettlement. While there are millions of refugees worldwide, only a sliver of them qualify for refugee resettlement, said Nayla Rush, a senior researcher at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors lowering immigration. And resettlement is only sought by the world’s most vulnerable refugees — those who have fled their home countries for a second country and either cannot return home or must then flee to a third. These ""third"" countries, according to the U.S. Department of State, are ""typically more developed countries, further from conflict regions, such as the United States."" Resettlement does not apply to every person seeking refugee status. ""You cannot resettle millions,"" Rush said. ""This resettlement program was offered to people who even in their country of refuge, they cannot stay."" Priority categories So not every refugee is resettled. But among those who are, is the process always directed through the United Nations? To get an answer, we spoke with Larry Yungk, a senior resettlement officer at the U.N. He told us that McCaskill is incorrect. Although uncommon, the United States does see direct applications for refugee resettlement, Yungk said. Yungk directed us to a State Department report to Congress on proposed refugee admissions for fiscal year 2017. The document explained that refugees looking to apply for resettlement are categorized into three different ""priority"" groups. The way an individual reaches the United States – through the United Nations or not – depends on the priority group he or she is in. -- In Priority 1 cases, individuals are referred to the United States Refugee Admissions Program by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees based on their circumstances and need for resettlement. This means that the people in this category apply and are admitted to the program individually, on a case by case basis. --In Priority 2 cases, groups of people are referred to the Refugee Admissions Program based on their circumstances and need for resettlement. This means that those in this category apply and are admitted to the program in groups, and not on a case-by-case basis. -- In Priority 3 cases, refugees are referred to the Refugee Admissions Program through applications submitted by nuclear family members already living in the United States. These refugees are ""granted access for the purposes of reunification"" with their families, according to the report to Congress. Resettlement cases in each priority group can be processed either through the U.N. or the United States depending on the circumstance, Yungk said, though the majority of cases are handled through the U.N. In Priority 3 cases, the United States is most involved. In Priority 1 cases, the U.N. is most involved. Overall, Yungk estimated that about 20 percent to 30 percent of resettlement cases are handled by the United States and not the U.N. ""We don’t refer anybody under P3 because that’s a U.S. program,"" Yungk said. ""In P2, I would say about half the group are ours and about half are U.S.-defined P2s ... most of the individual cases come from us,"" he said. Our ruling McCaskill said ""nobody applies to the United States for refugee status. They apply to the United Nations."" Overall, most refugees seeking resettlement to the United States must first go through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. However, refugees with nuclear family members already living in the United States are given a different priority that isn’t processed through the United Nations.

North Korea's missile testing and development has increased 'twenty-fold' says Sen. Richard Burr
","Shortly after North Korea failed to launch a missile in an attempted show of force, one of the U.S. congressmen who keeps a particularly close eye on the erratic dictatorship had a warning. North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told a group of constituents at a meeting in Youngsville, N.C., that North Korea’s latest actions were ""something to really be concerned about."" Burr went on to explain two reasons for his warning. One, he said, is that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might be crazy. The other, he said, is that Kim has significantly ramped up missile development and testing since taking over for his father, the late Kim Jong-il. ""When you do things like he does, you automatically assume he’s crazy,"" Burr said of Kim Jong Un. ""The pace of missile development between his father’s term and his term has increased the testing about twenty-fold."" There has been plenty of bluster and confusion surrounding the country’s missile launch lately – including the launch itself, a pre-launch parade replete with new military technology, and the Trump administration saying it had sent an aircraft carrier strike force to the area when, in reality, the ships were thousands of miles away and sailing in the opposite direction. So in the midst of so much noise, we wanted to know if Burr was right. Specifically, we looked into his claim that ""the pace of missile development between (Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un) has increased the testing about twenty-fold."" A tiny but well-armed country In terms of troops, North Korea has one of the world’s largest militaries, along with the United States (a major adversary), China (its biggest ally) and India. Kim Jong Il wasn’t hesitant to build and test missiles, much to the dismay of neighboring countries. So increasing missile activity by a factor of 20 would require serious commitment by the younger Kim. Burr’s office didn’t respond when we asked where he got his information. He is, of course, privy to all sorts of secret reports and briefings we don’t have at our own disposal. He’s the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which oversees the 17 U.S. spy agencies. But we don’t think he would have unveiled classified information. And from the information that is public, it appears Burr is more or less correct. Missile testing and development We interviewed multiple North Korea experts, none of whom said they could verify the numerical accuracy of Burr’s claim – especially as it relates to missile development. Missile tests can be counted, but it’s harder to quantify the speed at which new technologies are being developed and perfected. ""Perhaps saying the ‘pace of missile development’ is not quite accurate wording, but the pace of testing has indeed been unprecedented under Kim Jong Un,"" said Jean H. Lee. Lee is a former journalist who covered North Korea and now works for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. She said even failed tests are worrisome because North Korea is trying to create a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the United States. ""With every test, they get closer to mastering that technology,"" she said. We couldn’t find any report from the Department of Defense that might vouch for Burr’s numbers. But we did find a February speech by Admiral Harry Harris, the head of the DoD’s Pacific Command. He spoke about North Korea’s ""aggressive weapons test schedule"" and a growing missile threat in the Pacific, which is in keeping with the general theme of Burr’s claim. The North Korea experts we interviewed all said something like Lee’s assessment: That Burr is correct to say Kim Jong Un put a greater focus on missiles, even if it’s hard to define how much. ""The range of their missiles is being extended,"" said T.J. Pempel, a University of California, Berkeley, political science professor who specializes in northeast Asia. ""They have substantial submarine launched missiles; they have ICBMs. The frequency and number of their tests is also going up."" Joseph Bermudez, an expert with the North Korea analysis group 38 North who has testified before Congress and the United Nations on the country’s missiles, said Burr is right about the increased pace of testing. One of Bermudez’s colleagues at 38 North put together a timeline of missile tests by North Korea, along with an assessment that nearly backs up Burr’s point – at least about testing, if not about development. It said North Korea tested only one missile in 2006 (under Kim Jong Il) but tested 15 in 2014 (under Kim Jong Un). In 2016, the DoD’s annual report to Congress made a similar point. ""Kim Jong Un seems to prioritize the development of new weapons systems, as demonstrated by his numerous appearances with military units and research and development organizations,"" the report read. But Bermudez said Burr’s not necessarily right to say an increase in testing equates to breakthroughs in development. Every missile program requires research and development, testing, training, tweaking and more testing. It’s not a fluid timeline, Bermudez said. There are spikes in activity surrounded by relatively dormant periods. ""Now if you have multiple missile programs going on, these cycles overlap,"" he said. ""... It might give the false impression that something is happening that isn't happening."" Furthermore, he said, many North Korean missile tests are conducted for political reasons, intended to send a message instead of to further research and development. That’s another factor making it difficult to tell if the pace of development has driven the increase in the pace of testing, as Burr had claimed. Our ruling Sen. Richard Burr said that in North Korea, ""the pace of missile development between (Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un) has increased the testing about twenty-fold."" Experts say missile testing has certainly increased, and at least one analysis shows that increase was close to what Burr said. What’s less clear is if the increased testing has gone hand-in-hand with increased development, or if the tests aren’t moving the country’s missile program forward as much as they might seem. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/apr/24/richard-burr/north-koreas-missile-testing-and-development-has-i/

How do Donald Trump's first 100 days rate historically?
","As he neared the end of his first 100 days in office, President Donald Trump touted his first three months as a rousing success. ""No administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days,"" Trump told an audience in Kenosha, Wis. That’s a pretty high bar, especially for an administration that has registered historically low levels of support in public-approval polls for presidents this early in their terms. The White House didn’t respond to an inquiry for this article, but when asked about some of the president’s 100-day accomplishments during the April 19 press briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer cited a series of executive orders, including some on regulatory reform; a drop in border crossings; and job creation. He said more details would be offered as the 100-day mark approached. We interviewed historians and considered the 100-day track records of presidents back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While there’s a lot of nuance in gauging accomplishments, Trump doesn’t have much evidence to back up his boast that his administration has accomplished the most. First, some caveats All presidencies are different, and there’s an especially big difference between those that began after an election and those that got their start suddenly. The latter category includes presidents who took over after the death of their predecessor (such as Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson) or their predecessor’s resignation (Gerald Ford). In addition, it’s easier for a president to put points on the board quickly if they enter office in the midst of a national crisis. This was true for Roosevelt (the Great Depression), Truman (the end of World War II), Ford (the Watergate scandal), and Barack Obama (the Great Recession). Without a crisis, Congress is less likely to act quickly. Perhaps most notably, there is widespread agreement among historians that the 100-day standard is arbitrary. Just because a president signs a significant law outside the 100-day window doesn’t make it less of an accomplishment. For instance, Johnson and Ronald Reagan ""laid the groundwork for gigantic accomplishments"" such as on civil rights and taxes, respectively, that fell outside the 100-day window, said Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz. And both Truman and Dwight Eisenhower were preoccupied with wars during their first 100 days, said Max J. Skidmore, a University of Missouri-Kansas City political scientist who has written several books on the presidency. This meant they ""did not have much in the way of legislative achievements during that period,"" Skidmore said. All in all, ""most presidents have not considered 100 days a significant milepost,"" said H.W. Brands, a presidential historian at the University of Texas-Austin whose books include Traitor to His Class: The Privileged Life and Radical Presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. ""It's largely a media thing."" The numbers Let’s start with the raw numbers, Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker did some calculations comparing Trump’s bill-signing output to that of his predecessors during their first 100 days. The Post counted 28 bills signed by Trump -- the highest since 1949, but well below the 76 signed by Roosevelt in 1933. Moreover, many of Trump’s bills were ""minor or housekeeping bills,"" and none met a longstanding political-science standard for ""major bills."" By contrast, at least nine of Roosevelt’s did. Meanwhile, by the time of the Kenosha speech, Trump had signed 24 executive orders, 22 presidential memorandums, and 20 proclamations, the Post noted. Some of these started the ball rolling to overturn federal regulations. While these may eventually have a significant impact, it’s worth noting that many new presidents routinely issue orders during their first 100 days that overturn actions of their predecessors of the opposite party. For instance, just two days after taking office, President Bill Clinton signed orders overturning restrictions on abortion imposed during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, and with equal speed, President George W. Bush overturned Clinton’s opposition to a ban on aid to international groups that participate in abortions. ""Everyone does that, so it doesn’t give him a comparative edge,"" said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University historian who has written books about Presidents Richard Nixon and Calvin Coolidge. Trump’s accomplishments Historians we checked with mostly agreed that Trump’s appointment of Neil Gorsuch to fill a Supreme Court vacancy was a significant event, and one that could influence public policy long after Trump leaves the White House. That said, some cautioned against making too much of Gorsuch’s confirmation, arguing that it followed the nearly year-long blockage of Obama nominee Merrick Garland by the Republican Senate. ""It was really (Senate Majority Leader Mitch) McConnell's achievement,"" said Jeff Shesol, author of books on Roosevelt and Johnson and a former speechwriter for Clinton. Meanwhile, Trump’s military actions -- his missile strikes on Syria and the dropping of an unusually large bomb on an ISIS bunker -- are hardly unprecedented for a president’s first 100 days. George W. Bush attacked Iraqi radar sites to enforce a no-fly zone, and Obama pledged to double the number of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan. Trump’s decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement echoes George W. Bush’s decision to pull out of the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming. And the Trump administration’s successful effort to win the release of Aya Hijazi, an American aid worker jailed for three years in Egypt on dubious charges, isn’t unprecedented either. Moments after taking office in 1981, Ronald Reagan announced the imminent freeing of American hostages held in Iran for over a year. Several historians said Trump has faced some significant setbacks as well. His first big legislative push -- to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act -- stalled without even a final vote, and he has been slower than his predecessors in making sub-cabinet appointments. Trump also failed to submit a detailed budget proposal of the kind his predecessors had typically submitted by now. Then there’s Trump’s immigration ban, which would likely count as a major accomplishment if it’s enacted, but which is frozen for now. It was issued, blocked by the courts, rewritten, and then blocked again. ""The fact that he has gotten so little done while having Republican majorities in both houses of Congress is a terrible indictment,"" Shesol said. The champion: FDR The 100-day record of just one president -- Franklin Roosevelt -- would be enough to cast doubt on the accuracy of Trump’s claim that no administration has accomplished more. The 15 major bills Roosevelt signed included those that created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority (both of which still exist) and the Home Owners Loan Corp. He signed the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which established farm subsidies, and the National Industrial Recovery Act, which started public-works efforts to reverse the Great Depression. He signed legislation to legalize the manufacture and sale of beer and wine, and he issued executive orders to establish the Civilian Conservation Corps and to effectively take the United States off the gold standard. All in all, Roosevelt pushed the federal government to take a much bigger role than it had previously, said Adam Cohen, author of Nothing to Fear: FDR's Inner Circle and the Hundred Days That Created Modern America. ""When FDR took office, the banking system had collapsed,"" Cohen said. ""His emergency banking act got the banks open again and the system up and running. He got the Securities Act of 1933 enacted. It was the first major federal regulation of the stock market, which laid the groundwork for the kind of government regulation we now take for granted."" Other presidents’ 100-day achievements Other presidents have chalked up significant achievements as well. Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, while Obama signed not only a nearly $800 billion stimulus package to combat a spiraling recession but also the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and a law expanding the Children’s Health Insurance Program. He also implemented two urgent economic programs formally passed in the final weeks of George W. Bush’s presidency -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the auto industry bailout.   Other presidents have taken executive actions at least as significant as Trump’s. Kennedy established the Peace Corps (later ratified by Congress). Ford, meanwhile, pardoned his predecessor, Nixon, and offered amnesty to Vietnam War draft dodgers. Truman’s first 100 days were a whirlwind of foreign-policy actions -- the end of World War II in Europe, the writing of the United Nations charter, the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan, and Japan’s unconditional surrender. Sometimes, a president’s biggest accomplishment is intangible. Roosevelt calmed a nation gut-punched by the Depression, while Johnson reassured Americans after the shock of Kennedy’s assassination. ""The main accomplishment of LBJ's first 100 days -- and this should not be discounted just because it did not involve a bunch of bill signings -- was to give the nation and its government a sense of stability and continuity after one of the most wrenching events of the century,"" said his biographer, Shesol. Evaluating Trump’s 100 days One of the biggest impacts of Trump’s first 100 days may fall into this ""intangible"" category. ""Even if there are not many major tangible accomplishments, his administration has changed the political and cultural trajectory of the country -- not as much as FDR did following Herbert Hoover, but more than the average new president does,"" Cohen said. ""It has been somewhat amorphous and hard to quantify, but it is certainly something many Americans are feeling."" John Frendreis, a political scientist at Loyola University in Chicago, said Trump’s 100 days seem most similar to Clinton’s, which were also disorganized, short of focus and marked by the failure to pass an economic stimulus package. That said, he added, ""it is instructive to note that Clinton’s presidency turned out to be reasonably successful after this rocky start, so this suggests a similar turn-around is possible for Trump."" Whatever happens down the road, Trump, like his predecessors, is getting a dose of reality, Brands said. ""The big story of Trump's 100 days is how much reality has intruded on his notions of what a president can accomplish,"" he said. ""Every newcomer to the White House is sobered by the experience. Trump had more sobering to do to most."" Our ruling Trump said, ""No administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days."" Trump has had some achievements in office, but at the very least, they are much less numerous and far-reaching than those of Roosevelt, the standard against whom all presidents are measured. In more recent years, other presidents, including Obama, have accomplished more in their first 100 days than Trump has, historians say.

Fact-check: Did top Democrats vote for a border wall in 2006?
","White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said he doesn’t understand Democratic opposition to funding the border wall because top Democrats voted for it just over 10 years ago. During an April 23 segment on Fox News Sunday, Mulvaney talked down concerns about a government shutdown, but scolded Democrats for obstructing action on Trump’s border wall. Mulvaney pointed to the voting record of top Democrats in 2006 to explain his confusion. ""We want our priorities funded and one of the biggest priorities during the campaign was border security, keeping Americans safe, and part of that was a border wall,"" he said. ""We still don’t understand why the Democrats are so wholeheartedly against it. They voted for it in 2006. Then-Sen. Obama voted for it. Sen. Schumer voted for it. Sen. Clinton voted for it. So we don’t understand why Democrats are now playing politics just because Donald Trump is in office."" Mulvaney is referencing their votes on an act that authorized a fence, but as we’ve noted several times in the past, the 2006 fence was less ambitious than the wall Trump is proposing. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President George W. Bush, authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the United States and Mexico. The act also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to curb illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. At the time the act was being considered, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer were all members of the Senate. (Schumer of New York is now the Senate minority leader.) Obama, Clinton, Schumer and 23 other Democratic senators voted in favor of the act when it passed in the Senate by a vote of 80 to 19. Originally, the act called on the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended later, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement. Currently, 702 miles of fencing separates the United States from Mexico, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. So how does that compare to Trump’s wall? Trump plans for the wall are vague, but here’s what we know. He said the wall doesn’t need to run the nearly 2,000 miles of the border, but about 1,000 miles because of natural barriers. He said it could cost between $8 billion and $12 billion, be made of precast concrete, and rise 35 to 40 feet, or 50 feet, or higher. Experts have repeatedly told PolitiFact that the differences in semantics between a wall and a fence are not too significant because both block people. Still, there are obvious differences between the fence and Trump’s wall proposal. A 2016 Associated Press report from the border described ""rust-colored thick bars"" that form ""teeth-like slats"" 18 feet high. ""There are miles of gaps between segments and openings in the fence itself,"" the report said. Trump criticized the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 campaign. ""Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad,"" Trump said. (Actually, the project didn’t face environmental hurdles; we rated that part of the claim Mostly False.) It’s also worth noting that the political context surrounding the 2006 vote was different, too. Democrats normally in favor of looser immigration laws saw the Secure Fence Act of 2006 as the lesser of two evils, according to a Boston Globe report that detailed the legislative process. Around that same time, the House passed legislation that would make any undocumented immigrant a felon. ""It didn’t have anywhere near the gravity of harm,"" Angela Kelley, who in 2006 was the legislative director for the National Immigration Forum, told the Boston Globe. ""It was hard to vote against it because who is going to vote against a secure fence? And it was benign compared with what was out there."" Democrats have described Trump’s wall proposal as overkill and too expensive. Recently, Democrats penned a letter to Senate GOP saying border funding should not be included in the latest budget agreement to keep the government open. Our ruling Mulvaney said that Obama, Schumer and Clinton voted for a border wall in 2006. They did vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. Still, the fence they voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump is proposing. Trump himself called the 2006 fence a ""nothing wall."" Mulvaney’s statement is partially accurate, but ignores important context. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2017/apr/23/mick-mulvaney/fact-check-did-top-democrats-vote-border-wall-2006/

Missouri has borrowed money for unemployment insurance in 5 recessions
","Ever since the Great Recession in 2007-09, Missouri lawmakers have been trying to change Missouri’s unemployment benefits. House Bill 228 is the General Assembly’s third attempt in the past four legislative sessions to offer unemployment benefits on a sliding scale. If passed, the bill would link the amount of weeks a person could receive unemployment benefits to the state’s unemployment rate. Currently, Missouri offers up to 20 weeks of unemployment benefits. The bill proposes that when Missouri has a low unemployment rate — 6 percent or lower — benefits would be available for only 13 weeks. As the rate increases, so do the benefits. At most, people could collect up to 20 weeks of benefits if the unemployment rate is 9 percent or higher. Supporters said the bill will ensure the state does not deplete the state’s unemployment trust fund, which is how Missouri saves money for unemployment benefits during recessions. When the fund reaches zero, the state must borrow money from the federal government, which involves paying high interest rates. Employers pay separate taxes to fund both the state and federal unemployment trust fund. The bill’s fiscal notes report it could save the state’s unemployment fund up to $82 million per year. The House passed HB 288 on February 23, and it now awaits a vote in the Senate. In the days after the House voted, Rep. Allen Andrews, R-Grant City, was quoted about the bill in an article on KMA Land, a website produced by a radio news station based in Shenandoah, Iowa. Andrews said, ""Missouri is actually the only state that has been forced to borrow money from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits during each of the last five economic downturns. This isn’t the only time Andrews has stated this. A fewlegislators and the Missouri Chamber of Commerce have repeated the statement as well. So we wanted to check it out. Missouri borrowing Andrews never answered PolitiFact’s many emails and calls, so we went to find the data on our own. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the last five recessions were To find out whether Missouri borrowed a Federal Title XII loan to pay for unemployment benefits deficits during those time periods, we went to the U.S. Department of Labor. The data showed that at year’s end of the following years, Missouri had borrowed money to fully fund unemployment benefits claims: These year years don’t exactly match up with the recessions — Missouri borrows just after the recessions’ end dates — but that’s normal, said Robert Pavosevich, lead actuary for the U.S. Department of Labor. States usually take out loans at the end of a recession, not in the middle, when unemployment remains high, he said. In fact, Pavosevich said that using the strict definition of a recession ""wouldn’t be fair."" ""When people talk about recession, generally they’re talking about when unemployment is high, not the official date,"" he said. ""(Andrews) probably meant the time period overall."" So far, Andrews is correct: Missouri has borrowed money from the federal government in the last five recessions to make up for deficits in its unemployment trust fund — but is it the only state to do so? The only state A review of data on borrowing by the other 49 states along with Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands confirms that Missouri is indeed the only state to receive a loan from the federal government for the unemployment trust fund during the past five economic downturns. There are five close contenders that borrowed during four of the five recessions: Neither Michigan nor Connecticut borrowed for the 2001 recession, while Minnesota, Texas and Illinois didn’t borrow for the 1990-91 recession. Pavosevich said there were two other ways that could invalidate Andrews’ claim. States could have borrowed and paid back a loan within a year, which wouldn’t have been represented on the data available on the department’s website. Additionally, several states use private borrowing to pay back the Title XII loan to the government by selling state bonds to the private market; these states have outstanding loans for unemployment benefits but not to the government. Pavosevich looked into the data, which isn’t publicly available, for these two caveats — paying the Title XII loan within the year and private borrowing — and found that Missouri is the only state to to have taken out a loan during or right after each of the last five recession. ""(It) appears that the statement is true if you consider recessionary periods rather broadly,"" Pavosevich concluded in an email. Our ruling Andrews said, ""Missouri is actually the only state that has been forced to borrow money from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits during each of the last five economic downturns."" According to the data from the U.S. Department of Labor, not only did Missouri take out loans from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits during economic downturns, but also it is the only state to do so.

"['Health Care', 'New York', 'Club for Growth']","
New conservative health care proposal would have little impact in New York
","Some conservatives want to give states the option to waive certain insurance requirements enacted under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. One waiver would allow insurers to charge people with preexisting conditions more than healthy people for the same insurance plans. Less regulation would mean lower costs for consumers, they say. But some Republicans in Congress -- even those who supported an earlier Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act -- are apprehensive about the new effort to adopt the waivers.  So the Club for Growth -- an advocacy group focused on conservative economic policy and which supports a full repeal of ObamaCare -- announced a $1 million ad campaign targeting 10 House Republicans to prod them to support the health care plan. One of them is Rep. Chris Collins, the Republican from Clarence.  ""President Trump and House conservatives have come together with a new plan. It lowers premiums by giving New York the freedom to end Obamacare’s costly and ridiculous rules,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""So, who’s standing in the way? Professional politicians like Congressman Chris Collins."" Club for Growth did not respond to our inquiry about the ad. Collins supported the Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act before congressional leaders pulled it off the table last month. The bill was dropped after conservative Republicans in Congress said they would not vote for it without more freedom for states. The new proposal may bring those members on board, but Collins has not said publicly if he supports the plan. Like President Donald Trump, Collins ran for office promising to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Club for Growth should ""work alongside President Trump and Congressman Collins, not against them,"" according to a statement from a Collins spokesman. The new plan would reportedly allow states to waive two major requirements the Affordable Care Act imposes on insurance companies. The first requirement mandates equal premiums for people with pre-existing conditions. The new proposal would allow states to waive that requirement if they establish their own high-risk pool or participate in a federal high-risk pool for people with pre-existing conditions. The second mandate requires coverage for a set of standards called essential health benefits under the federal law. Under the new proposal, insurance companies could offer stripped-down plans to individuals on the open market at a lower price, conservatives say. The Club for Growth’s claim assumes that New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a major supporter of the Affordable Care Act, would seek a waiver for either requirement. That’s not likely, though a future governor may feel differently. Is the ad right that the conservative plan would lower premiums in New York state? Coverage for pre-existing conditions Before the Affordable Care Act in 2010, federal law allowed insurance companies to deny coverage or charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions. But for almost two decades New York state already had a state law offering the same kind of protections for pre-existing conditions that Obamacare provided. The state adopted what’s known as a ""community rating"" model of health insurance in 1993. It remains law today. The law blocks insurance companies from charging different premiums based on a pre-existing condition, age, gender, occupation, or past tobacco use in a select region. If the federal regulations are repealed or waived, New York state still has its own law. It would have to be repealed for an insurance company to charge customers differently based on a pre-existing condition. Essential health benefits The Affordable Care Act also requires health plans to provide ""essential health benefits"" that range from ambulance service to maternity care. ""Right now we don’t have a codification on the book, per say, in state insurance law that says here are these ten essential health benefits, you have to cover them,"" said Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Serve Society of New York. Most of the benefits are already required under state law, but some are not, Benjamin said. State law does not mandate prescription drug coverage in all insurance plans, for example. State lawmakers passed legislation in 2013 that, among other provisions, requires insurance companies to cover the federal essential health benefits. It used the Affordable Care Act to define them. That part of the state law would become unenforceable if Congress repealed and replaced the federal health care law. The state has three options to preserve those standards if Congress allows waivers to the mandate. Cuomo, or any of his successors, could choose against seeking a waiver. That would leave the requirement in place at the federal level. Second, the New York State Legislature could pass a state law to establish minimum standards for insurance plans. The state Department of Financial Services, which regulates health insurance in New York state, may also be able to set minimum requirements for insurance plans through regulatory power, Benjamin said. The essential health benefits would only be scrapped in the case of a waiver for the state or a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act without a replacement. An earlier Collins health care fact check  In a previous PolitiFact New York article, we checked Collins' claim that in New York state ""you cannot charge an older person even one dollar more than a younger person"" for health insurance. We rated his claim True. New York state has barred insurance companies from pricing based on age for more than two decades. Experts say the Affordable Care Act did not impact that law, and its would-be Republican replacement would not have either. Would that lower premiums? Conservatives backing the new proposal say the waivers would lead to lower premiums. Fewer mandates on insurance companies would allow them to offer lower-priced plans. But those plans may not provide the same coverage consumers see now. ""Generally speaking, I do agree with the assessment that, all other things being equal, rates would go down as a result of not requiring essential health benefits,"" said Dave Dillon, a fellow at the Society of Actuaries. Milliman Inc., a leading cost-analysis firm in health care, agreed in its analysis last month. ""Removing certain benefits becomes an area where insurance companies can compete,"" the report says. ""Fewer services means a lower price."" But that may not be the case in New York state. The state would still mandate most of the federally-defined essential health benefits, which could provide less incentive for insurance providers to drop prices. Our ruling An ad from conservative group Club for Growth says a new plan to replace the Affordable Care Act ""lowers premiums by giving New York the freedom to end Obamacare’s costly and ridiculous rules."" That is literally true, but ignores that New York state already enforces most of the same insurance regulations at the state level. There’s an element of truth in its claim, but it would take major actions at the state level to become a reality. That is unlikely. So we rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/apr/22/club-growth/new-conservative-health-care-proposal-would-have-l/

Howard Dean's wrong tweet that the Constitution doesn't protect 'hate speech'
","The Constitution doesn’t protect ""hate speech,"" said former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, chiming into the debate over conservative pundit Ann Coulter’s upcoming event at the University of California, Berkeley. In February, Berkeley administrators had to cancel a speech by conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos after protesters set fires and threw objects at buildings. So after Berkeley College Republicans invited Coulter to speak on campus, administrators decided to postpone the event because they couldn’t make the necessary security preparations by the event date, April 27. As of April 21, Berkeley has invited Coulter to speak May 2 instead of the original date. But Coulter wants to stick to April 27, arguing that the postponement and other restrictions are arbitrary. Dean took to Twitter with his reaction to comments Coulter made in 2002 about the Oklahoma City bomber. She said, ""My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building."" ""Hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment,"" Dean tweeted April 20. Hate speech is not protected by the first amendment. https://t.co/DOct3xcLoY This is incorrect. There is no universal definition of ""hate speech,"" though Coulter has made a number of controversial comments about Mexicans, Muslims, Jews and immigrants generally that some might say fall under that umbrella.   Regardless, the courts have decided that there are some forms of speech the Constitution doesn’t protect. But ""hate speech"" isn’t one. The First Amendment of the Constitution, included in the Bill of Rights, says: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."" This clause doesn’t apply to threats, child pornography and ""fighting words"" (speech that would likely draw someone into a fight, such as personal insults). There are numerous examples of the Supreme Court protecting speech that much of the public would find offensive or consider to be ""hate speech."" In 1969, the Supreme Court said an Ohio law prohibiting public speech that promotes illegal activity violated a Ku Klux Klan member’s First Amendment rights. In 1992, the court unanimously struck down a St. Paul, Minn., law that banned displaying a symbol that ""arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender,"" like a burning cross. More recently, the family of a deceased soldier sued members of the Westboro Baptist Church who had protested the soldier’s funeral with signs displaying anti-gay slogans. But in 2011, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment right to free speech meant that the church members were not liable. Sometimes hate speech is also a threat or ""fighting words."" In those cases, hate speech would be excluded from protections offered by the First Amendment, said James Weinstein, an expert in free speech at Arizona State University’s Sandra Day O’Connor Law School, in a past PolitiFact interview. For example, it would be unconstitutional to ban someone from putting a racial epithet on a sign at a protest. But if someone used the same racial epithet while credibly saying they plan to harm someone of that race, that might count as a threat and therefore lose its First Amendment protection. But the speech loses the protection because it’s a threat, not because it’s hate speech. ""With that caveat, the overwhelming understanding is that ‘hate speech’ is constitutionally protected in the United States,"" Michael Herz, a professor at Cardozo Law, previously told PolitiFact. We reached out to Dean’s staff for comment and didn’t hear back. But he did link to a tweet from former New York Times reporter Steven Greenhouse that referenced Coulter’s statement that she regrets that the Oklahoma City bomber didn’t hit the New York Times building. Even though Coulter’s comment mentions a violent act, it isn’t clearly ""intended to promote imminent illegal conduct,"" which is the standard necessary for the speech to no longer have constitutional protection, wrote Eugene Volokh, a First Amendment expert and law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, in a blog reacting to Dean’s tweet. Regardless, Dean appears to be saying that the Coulter quote is hate speech — as opposed to a threat or ""fighting words"" — and that isn’t enough to strip it of its First Amendment protections. Separate from the ""hate speech"" question, we wondered if Berkeley’s treatment of Coulter violates her First Amendment right to free speech. Coulter has the constitutional right to be treated in the same way as other campus speakers without regard to her viewpoint, Volokh said in an interview with PolitiFact. Berkeley has a policy by which student groups can invite speakers of their choosing, and as a public university, it cannot administer this policy in a way that treats student groups differently based on political leanings, he said. University administrators have said their concern is not Coulter’s politics; instead they’re worried about the potential for violent protest. But this also might not pass muster as a reason for Berkeley to treat Coulter different than other campus speakers. The Supreme Court has established a general principle that a government administrator can’t decide to charge a group a higher fee for event security based on anticipated public reaction to the content of the event, and a lower court found that this applies to colleges, too. So if Berkeley is basing its security decisions on what it expects Coulter to say, that could pose a problem. Our ruling Dean said, ""Hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment."" There are some exceptions to the free speech clause in the First Amendment, but ""hate speech"" is not one of them. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held up the right of an individual or group to engage in speech that much of the public likely finds offensive, like displaying swastikas, burning crosses or protesting a soldier’s funeral.

Trump wants to expand oil drilling despite Congress not adding safety rules, Senator says
","On the anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon BP oil spill, Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., attacked President Donald Trump for his stance on drilling and portrayed Congress as doing nothing in the aftermath of the 2010 explosion. ""Trump looking to open up E Coast & new areas for offshore oil drilling when Congress has passed no new safety standards since BP,"" Markey tweeted April 20.   We wanted to know what Trump’s plans were and if Congress has done nothing since the explosion. The April 20, 2010, explosion of BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig was the worst offshore drilling catastrophe in U.S. history. The explosion killed 11 workers, and 134 million gallons of oil were released into the Gulf of Mexico. We emailed a spokesman for Trump and did not get a reply; however, a spokesman for the Bureau of Ocean Management sent information about the reorganization of federal agencies that oversee drilling during the Obama administration. Trump on drilling In 2006, Congress passed a bill to ban oil drilling within 125 miles off much of Florida’s coast and up to 235 miles at some points. The ban is set to expire in 2022. There have been efforts by some Republicans to expand offshore drilling, but so far they have failed. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La, sponsored The American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016 to allow drilling 50 miles off Florida’s Gulf Shores, but the Senate rejected moving ahead on it in November. In response, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., filed a bill to extend the ban by five years, but the Senate hasn’t voted on his bill. During the campaign, Trump generally spoke favorably of expanding oil drilling, although he sounded skeptical about a proposal to allow offshore drilling closer to the Florida beaches in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times, PolitiFact’s parent company, in February 2016. ""They've already got plenty in the Gulf,"" Trump said. ""It would be a little bit of a shame (to expand drilling closer to Florida), because there's so much fracking, and there's so much oil that we have now that we never thought possible. That's an issue I'd absolutely study and do the right thing."" But later in the campaign Trump endorsed more drilling and promised to ""accomplish a complete American energy independence. Complete. Complete."" Trump’s America First Energy Plan called for opening up onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands. A couple months into his administration in March, Trump’s Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke proposed leasing 73 million acres offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida for oil and gas exploration and development starting in August 2017. That was similar to the Obama administration plan. As he was leaving office, President Barack Obama banned drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans for the next five years, but allowed it in the gulf primarily in areas other than Florida. But despite Trump’s rhetoric, the industry hasn’t shown much interest in expanding drilling due to low oil prices, said Athan Manuel, who directs Sierra Club’s Lands Protection Program. ""Ideologically the Trump administration wants to push drilling everywhere, but companies are being cautious right now because the cost so low,"" he said. On March 28, Trump issued an executive order that called for a review of agency actions that ""potentially burden the safe, efficient development of domestic energy resources,"" including oil. Regulations following explosion After BP’s Deepwater Horizon explosion, lawmakers couldn’t agree on safety standard legislation. In 2010, the House approved an overhaul of safety standards, but it never got the approval in the Senate. The Obama administration took some steps to tighten rules in an effort to avoid similar spills, although the rules took several years to develop, and some environmentalists have criticized them as insufficient. In April 2015 -- five years after the explosion -- the administration unveiled a proposed rule to tighten safety standards for blowout preventers, devices that are designed to stop undersea oil wells from exploding. During the Deepwater Horizon explosion, the blowout preventer malfunctioned. The rule was finalized in March 2016. Bob Bea, an expert on risk management and a former Shell executive, told PolitiFact that little has changed in either the regulatory regime or the industrial regime in the United States. He repeatedly said during the Obama administration that the government hadn’t gone far enough in terms of risk assessment. ""Yes, new government 'rules' have been enacted, and new industry 'guidelines' have been issued, but either they have not been implemented or they have not been implemented properly,"" he said. The Government Accountability Office reported in March 2017 that the Interior Department has struggled to successfully implement key initiatives to improve offshore oversight. For example, a risk-based facility inspection initiative was halted due to concerns about its usefulness and unclear protocols. Our ruling Markey tweeted, ""Trump looking to open up E Coast & new areas for offshore oil drilling when Congress has passed no new safety standards since BP."" During the campaign, Trump frequently expressed support to open up more oil drilling. Since in office, his administration proposed leasing 73 million acres offshore starting in August 2017. After the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion, Congress couldn’t agree on safety standards. The Obama administration took some steps to improve safety standards, though some environmentalists say that the government didn’t go far enough.

Did Trump really mention WikiLeaks over 160 times in the last month of the election cycle?
","President Donald Trump reveled in WikiLeaks’ disclosures against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton during the closing argument of his presidential campaign. His CIA director, Mike Pompeo, revealed a different attitude in a tough April 13 speech which addressed the anonymous hacking website. The group ""walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service,"" Pompeo said. U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., was one of many voices who noticed the administration’s hardened view toward WikiLeaks. CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer interviewed Speier, a member of the House intelligence committee, on April 13 about Pompeo’s characterization of WikiLeaks. How much did Trump the candidate love WikiLeaks in the last days of the campaign? She attempted to count the ways. ""If you recall during the election cycle, in the last month of the campaign, I believe that President Trump as a candidate hailed WikiLeaks as the new savior, had mentioned it over 160 times in speeches during that period of time. Really, that many times? We decided to check it out. WikiLeaks released tens of thousands of emails from the account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta in October 2016 and released thousands of emails from Democratic National Committee staffers in July 2016.   Speier’s office said she was referring to a Jan. 7 article by left-leaning website ThinkProgress for her statement. Here’s how that article began: ""President-elect Trump says that information published by WikiLeaks, which the U.S. intelligence community says was hacked by Russia, had ‘absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.’ This was not the view of candidate Trump, who talked about WikiLeaks and the content of the emails it released at least 164 times in last month of the campaign."" The article analyzed Trump’s ""speeches, media appearances and debates"" to get a tally of 164 mentions from Oct. 10 to Nov. 8. That number includes 124 times Trump mentioned the group by name, with the rest being mentions of the emails released by WikiLeaks. We set out on our own review, looking through transcripts from Congressional Quarterly by searching for the words ""WikiLeaks"" and ""Trump,"" and limiting results to the last month of the campaign. We found Trump said the word ""WikiLeaks"" about 137 times in campaign rallies, interviews, speeches, his tweets and other social media presence, and debates. Speier’s figure of over 160 seems possible, however, because he often referenced disclosures from WikiLeaks without using the group’s name, and it’s possible there were interviews or speeches where Trump brought up WikiLeaks that our search didn’t return. At the time, Wikileaks steadily released a series of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman. These emails were characterized by Trump and her other critics as showing Clinton held policy positions in private that were different from her public positions, that she received town hall topics in advance, and that they demonstrated negative internal dynamics inside the Clinton campaign. Trump repeatedly brought up the emails, encouraged his supporters to see them for themselves, and also described several revelations inaccurately.  Let’s replay some of the biggest hits. ""The WikiLeaks revelations have revealed a degree of corruption at the highest levels of our government like nothing we have ever seen as a country before,""  Trump said at a rally in Colorado on Oct. 29. ""Hillary Clinton, as WikiLeaks proves, is a corrupt globalist,"" he said at a rally on Oct 21. ""I love WikiLeaks,"" he said on Oct. 10. Trump has not said much publicly about WikiLeaks as president. The closest moment came during the transition. After receiving an intelligence briefing on Jan. 6, Trump released a statement that said ""while Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election."" He also brought up Donna Brazile’s passing of town hall topics to a Clinton staffer ahead of a primary debate in an interview with Time magazine on March 23, 2017. Our ruling Speier said Trump as a candidate mentioned WikiLeaks ""over 160 times in speeches"" in the last 30 days of the campaign. Official counts may vary, but her larger point is clear: Trump brought up WikiLeaks a lot in the waning days of the campaign. He has stayed largely mum about the group since taking office, even as his CIA director said WikiLeaks acts like a ""hostile intelligence service.""

Wawa Welcome America: The largest free concert in the USA? Really?
","On April 13, Wawa, Inc. and Welcome America, Inc., a nonprofit in partnership with the City of Philadelphia, sent out a press release to announce Wawa’s continued commitment to hosting Wawa Welcome America, Philadelphia’s Fourth of July festival. Wawa confirmed it will continue to host the 25-year-old celebration through 2019. The citywide, six-day festival includes fireworks, free museum admission and what the press release claims to be the largest free public concert in the country: ""The Wawa Welcome America festival is the nation’s signature July 4th celebration in the birthplace of our nation. This multi-day, citywide festival features all FREE events such as America’s largest free concert, some of the nation’s largest fireworks displays, outdoor movie screenings, free museum days, neighborhood events and more."" Last year’s celebration peaked at around 25,000, but that number accounts for the whole day’s worth of activities at Benjamin Franklin Parkway, from noon until the fireworks, which begin after the concert ends at 10 p.m. The attendance for the concert, which began at 5 p.m., dwindled last year to 6,500 due to escalating rainfall. Generally, Wawa Welcome America does attract a significantly bigger audience. In 2015, Philly.com reported that city officials estimated the crowd at the concert to be upwards of 175,000, with the full day’s attendance reaching 700,000 people. The lineup that year, curated by Philly native sons The Roots, snagged headliners Nicki Minaj and Ed Sheeran, as well as Jennifer Hudson. 175,000 people still isn’t the highest attendance at a free concert, though. Millions came out to celebrate the new millennium in Times Square’s New Year’s Eve bash in 2000. Each of President Obama’s inauguration events (with entertainment provided by Aretha Franklin in 2009 and Beyoncé in 2013) drew over a million people — in 2009 it was closer to two million. And, at the same time as Wawa Welcome America, there’s the July Fourth concert at the Capitol; last year the headliners of that, which also runs live on PBS and NPR, included country stars Gavin Degraw and Cassadee Pope, as well as Christopher Jackson, who played George Washington in the Broadway hit ""Hamilton."" The year before, Hunter Hayes and KC and the Sunshine Band led up to headliner Barry Manilow. All of these are free events — though some of them aren’t centered around the performances, like the presidential inaugurations — that include concerts that are free and open to the public. They fit the description. Melanie Sole, a spokesperson for Welcome America, explained it’s pretty difficult to accurately compare crowd sizes from events in different cities because ""every city counts things differently and there are many factors to be aware of when comparing city to city."" Crowd size estimates also tend to have political- and business-related biases. A prime example is the Trump administration’s claim that the president’s inauguration crowd was much larger than it appeared to be in aerial photos. Because of common biases and inaccuracies often involved in measuring crowds, Digital Design and Imaging Services markets itself as being able to provide an ""accurate, defensible crowd count."" Specialists there have offered crowd size estimates for major events in Washington D.C. like the recent Women’s March and Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert’s 2010 Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear, which DDIS estimated drew 215,000 people, claiming only a 10 percent margin of error. The specialists at DDIS are able to provide some of the most accurate estimations of crowd size partly because of a kind of technology they developed themselves called a balloon test, which isn’t an actual balloon, but a ten inch orb tethered to float above a crowd and use laser rangefinders to scan the area. The Federal Aviation Administration bans flying helicopters over large gatherings for safety purposes, so without a balloon test it’s difficult to get a good aerial view for a measurement tool. Even without use of the DDIS’s resources, to get an even close to accurate estimate, ""you must have high resolution photos, you must have orthographic views, and you must have lingering resources to determine a peak [in attendance],"" President of DDIS Curt Westergard explained. It’s not an easy measurement to get correct. Inaccurate counts can lead not only to dangerous situations regarding people in the crowds getting swift access to resources in emergency situations, but also make comparing sizes at different events extremely difficult. ""We make our comparisons to other publicly reported data by other Independence Day concerts plus review available data from the music industry and other sources,"" Sole said of Welcome America’s crowd size estimations. She added, ""No other free Independence Day concert in America makes our claim nor has sought trademarks as ‘America’s Free Largest Independence Day Concert.’ There may be other data not publicly available or known to us."" Even assuming the estimations Welcome America is relying on are accurate, 175,000 people definitely isn’t the largest free concert audience in the United States, as shown above. Concerts at inauguration events and New Year’s Eve celebrations regularly top that count. In a separate email, Sole added quite a few more qualifiers to the initial statement, asserting that the Wawa Welcome America concert is the ""longest, diverse, inclusive, free, live concert event on July 4th—Independence Day."" Even restricting the comparison to that day, Philadelphia’s concert still isn’t the biggest. Washington, D.C.’s concert has drawn up to 250,000 people in past years, reports The Washington Times. Though the National Park Service no longer provides a count, the Metro system, which provides estimates of crowd sizes by measuring the amount of people using transit, said their count reached 500,000 for 2013’s celebration. Sole also provided a list of additional criteria Welcome America uses to distinguish its event as the biggest nationwide: • The Parkway is one continuous space with unobstructed views from Love Park to the Main stage for one, continuous, live concert experience. The Parkway can accommodate a range of crowds compared to other venues in other cities that may have multiple ""official"" sites. • Factors in the counting of attendees--over time--include the timing of the Parkway pre-concert entertainment, the length of the live concert, diversity of performers, audience appeal, fireworks timing, weather and other factors (such as day of the week—this year July 4th is a Tuesday versus a long weekend or weekend day itself). • Review of Philly’s July 4th historical data and the Independence Day crowd estimates reported over time by the media and other sources along with visual evidence (such as pictures and videos). • We include live broadcast ratings and live streaming viewers. All portions of Philly’s events are live, never taped. However, none of these criteria were included in the original statement, which just claimed Wawa Welcome America features the largest free concert in the country-- not just on the Fourth of July and not based on the diversity of performers or the length of the live concert or whether the view of the stage is continually unobstructed. Today, Welcome America put out another announcement unveiling Mary J. Blige as the headliner for this year’s concert. This press release instead lauded the event as ""America’s largest free Independence Day concert."" Our ruling The original claim in Wawa and Welcome America’s press release stated Wawa Welcome America features America’s largest free concert. Welcome America Spokesperson later reiterated in an email that the organization measures a variety of factors including length of the concert, whether it’s live and whether there is an unobstructed view of the stage throughout the crowd. She also revised the initial claim and instead referred to the concert as the largest one in the US on Independence Day (which is still not totally accurate).

Did Obama pardon a terrorist and a traitor, as Katie Pavlich said?
","Following news that President Donald Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, an Arizona county sheriff who was convicted for criminal contempt when he refused to follow a court order to stop profiling Latinos, a former foreign policy adviser to Barack Obama decried Trump’s pardon. ""Obama used his pardon and commutation power to give a second chance to people who deserved empathy, not racists who showed none,"" Ben Rhodes tweeted. Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich came out in Trump’s defense. ""Your boss pardoned a traitor who gave U.S. enemies state secrets, he also pardoned a terrorist who killed Americans,"" Pavlich replied in a tweet that was shared over 24,700 times as of Aug. 29, 2017. Trump retweeted it. Your boss pardoned a traitor who gave U.S. enemies state secrets, he also pardoned a terrorist who killed Americans. Spare us the lecture. https://t.co/90jZcPXYqx Pavlich did not respond to our requests for clarification or comment, although she was likely referring to Chelsea Manning and Oscar Lopez Rivera respectively, who Trump referenced in an Aug. 28, 2017, press conference. Neither of these individuals, however, were pardoned by the former president. As Trump said in the conference, Manning and Lopez Rivera were granted commutations, or shortened sentences. Manning was an Army intelligence analyst convicted of leaking American military and diplomatic information through Wikileaks in 2010. Manning’s 35-year sentence was the longest ever imposed in the United States for a leak conviction, but it was cut short at seven years when Obama commuted, or shortened, her sentence. A transgender woman in a men’s military prison, Manning attempted suicide twice. Lopez Rivera helped lead the Armed Forces of National Liberation, a Puerto Rican nationalist movement. The group’s most famous bombing, in 1975, resulted in four deaths, although no one was charged with carrying it out. He received a 55-year sentence for seditious conspiracy, attempted robbery, explosives and vehicle theft that was extended 15 years after conspiracy to escape. Lopez Rivera was the last remaining member of the Armed Forces of National Liberation still in prison. In 1999, he rejected President Bill Clinton’s conditional clemency offer. Obama shortened his sentence to 36 years. Pavlich acknowledged she conflated pardons and commutations on Twitter without apologizing or taking it down. ""Ah, I see msm wants to squabble over pardon vs commutation (while also offering ‘unbiased’ opinions on the issue). Doesn't change the point,"" Pavlich tweeted on Aug. 28, 2017. Ah, I see msm wants to squabble over pardon vs commutation (while also offering ""unbiased"" opinions on the issue). Doesn't change the point https://t.co/dZrE6qu6LM The Justice Department classifies both commutation of sentence and pardon as forms of executive clemency, which the president can constitutionally exercise on those who have committed federal crimes. A commutation reduces the severity of a sentence, while a pardon undoes the conviction, removing its remaining consequences. Those consequences include such civil disabilities as ""restrictions on the right to vote, hold state or local office, or sit on a jury."" But according to Margaret Love, a former U.S. pardon attorney, civil disabilities are restored automatically by most states anyway. Pardons significantly strip away the hundreds of other collateral damages that come with criminal records, affecting jobs, licenses, benefits and public contracting opportunities. These remain in place for sentences that have simply been shortened. Michigan State University law professor Brian Kalt agreed that pardons are more substantial. ""But that doesn’t mean that one can’t compare them — if people think that the Manning or Lopez Rivera commutations were wrong, the fact that they were commutations and not pardons doesn’t make them okay,"" Kalt said. Arpaio’s pardon defies the norms of Justice Department clemency forms, as we’ve explained before. Trump sidestepped the Justice Department in pardoning Arpaio, who had not yet received or served a sentence. The Justice Department traditionally administers pardons after at least five years of serving time and expressing remorse.   Pavlich said Obama ""pardoned a traitor who gave U.S. enemies state secrets, he also pardoned a terrorist who killed Americans."" Obama did not pardon Manning or Lopez Rivera, instead issuing commutations, which alleviate punishment for, rather than grant forgiveness for, a federal crime. The legal consequences of each differ significantly, though both represent executive forms of clemency. Still, the difference here is not trivial.

Senator: Under Scott Walker, state is 16,000 manufacturing jobs lower than during recession
","In criticizing Gov. Scott Walker’s Foxconn factory deal, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout (D-Alma) lamented sluggish manufacturing growth and the governor’s manufacturing policies. Vinehout appeared Aug. 6, 2017, on WISN-TV’s ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" where she said under Walker the state is ""still 16,000 manufacturing jobs lower than we were during the recession."" In July 2017, Walker announced that technology giant Foxconn, a company best known for making iPhone components, planned to build a near-1,000 acre LCD factory in southeastern Wisconsin that could eventually lead to 13,000 jobs. In her interview with Gousha, Vinehout, who ran for governor in 2014 and may run again in 2018, criticized Walker for picking winners and losers and said the continued use of tax credits has not resulted in fast economic growth for Wisconsin’s manufacturing sector. But what about her claim? Are Wisconsin’s manufacturing jobs still 16,000 below the recession total? Sluggish growth Vinehout said in an email through an aide that her 16,000 jobs number was a conservative estimate, meaning that the actual number could be much larger. She laid out her analysis this way: The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce that tracks GDP and wages, showed 494,427 manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin at the end of 2008. She chose the annual number for 2008 because she said that’s the year the recession started. To be clear, the Great Recession started in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Next, Vinehout compared the 2008 annual number to a monthly report from Wisconsin’s Department of Workforce Development, which showed about 472,000 manufacturing jobs in June 2017 in Wisconsin. ""Using those numbers Wisconsin still has 22,327 manufacturing jobs to go to get back to the prerecession level,"" Vinehout said through an aide in an email. ""Monthly totals in 2008 would vary depending on which month you looked at."" While the numbers of each source may be sound, experts say it is not appropriate to compare a monthly number, particularly a preliminary one, with a final annual number. In doing so, Vinehout mixed together data that was collected and measured differently. Here at PolitiFact, we -- and economists -- consider the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics the gold standard for jobs numbers, specifically its Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages data. So, let’s do a calculation of job numbers using their annual numbers. That data shows an annual total of about 492,000 manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin in 2008. In 2016, the BLS reported about 463,000 manufacturing jobs in the state, meaning Wisconsin is about 29,000 jobs shy of returning to recession levels. While Vinehout’s methods might have been off, she’s not wrong in saying Wisconsin’s manufacturing sector hasn’t returned the jobs numbers it previously had. What’s more, the recent trend is not good. Manufacturing jobs fell between 2015 and 2016 by about 3,000, as overall job growth for the state slowed, according to a June 2, 2017, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Behind the claim In her claim, Vinehout used the numbers to criticize Walker’s performance as governor -- even though he took office in January 2011, well after the recession had ended. Experts said it is not fair to pin all of the blame for sluggish manufacturing growth in Wisconsin on Walker. Some of the factors that influence manufacturing job growth include state and federal economic policies, the overall national economy, automation replacing jobs, shipping jobs overseas and the decades-long shift from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-based economy. States set policies that can either attract or discourage businesses from coming, but it’s ultimately the decision of the private sector to decide where to set up shop, said Brian Jacobsen, a Wells Fargo senior investment strategist. He added that the effects of policies and reforms typically aren’t felt until years after they have been implemented. The state is ""not 100 percent responsible for creating or losing jobs, but state policies help attract new business to the state or retain existing businesses,"" said Abdur Chowdhury, a professor of economics at Marquette University. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson touted Walker’s policies as successful, citing plans from Foxconn and Haribo to build factories in the state. ""Governor Walker’s reforms have led to a resurgence in Wisconsin manufacturing and have created opportunities few could have imagined during the last recession,"" Evenson said. Our rating In a TV interview, Vinehout said Wisconsin under Walker is ""still 16,000 manufacturing jobs lower than we were during the recession."" She mixes and matches data from a few government sources, but is right in saying Wisconsin hasn’t hit pre-recession manufacturing job numbers. However, in using the number to criticize Walker, she ignores the fact he was not in office until several years after the recession ended and that governors only have a limited impact on the economy.

Fake news sites say celebrities praise Mormons, but quotes are made up
","A laundry list of fake news sites have posted a story claiming Adam Sandler praised Mormons in a podcast, but there’s no evidence the actor ever made the statements. The post, which we first saw on WRPM33.com on Aug. 23, 2017, ran under the headline, ""What Adam Sandler is saying about Mormons."" Facebook users flagged this post and several others on different websites as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to fight fake news. It’s nothing bad: The post actually says he found them to be exceptionally nice people. It’s just that we can’t find any evidence that Sandler actually said any of it. The post said Sandler was on an unnamed podcast when the atheist host began to disparage religion in general and Mormons in particular. Sandler, who grew up in a Jewish family, spoke up to defend the faith. ""I don’t know, Tom. I don’t think I’ve ever had a reason to say anything negative about Mormons. I mean, I know you’re just having some fun here but — from my experience — Mormons are some of the most decent people I’ve ever come across,"" the story attributed to Sandler. He said more in the post, but they aren’t real quotes. Apart from there being a parody out there of his Hanukkah Song adapted for Mormons, we really couldn’t find him making much of any comment about Mormons at all.

When can the 25th Amendment be used against a president?
","A Democratic lawmaker who disapproves of President Donald Trump recently suggested the 25th Amendment to the Constitution could provide a solution. ""POTUS is showing signs of erratic behavior and mental instability that place the country in grave danger,"" Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., tweeted on Aug. 15. ""Time to invoke the 25th Amendment.""  POTUS is showing signs of erratic behavior and mental instability that place the country in grave danger. Time to invoke the 25th Amendment. But not all Democrats see the 25th amendment as an appropriate way of responding to Trump. Asked whether he thinks it should be used against Trump, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the amendment does not apply to present circumstances. ""I think what the authors of the (25th) Amendment principally had in mind was some kind of physical incapacitation or serious mental illness or a breakdown, an inability to function in office,"" Schiff said Aug. 20 on CNN’s State of the Union. ""I think we're still far from concluding that that's the case, even though we find, many of us, his conduct anathema and there to be a serious problem here."" For this fact-check, we wanted to know if Schiff’s reading of the amendment’s origins is right. We’re not going to weigh in on whether Trump’s actions or mental state fit the criteria for presidential disability.   The 25th Amendment, added to the Constitution in 1967, sought to resolve several thorny issues of presidential and vice presidential power. It creates a succession plan for when these top two positions go vacant. It also allows the president to declare himself unable to fulfill his duties and transfer power to the vice president. However, we’re mostly interested in the 25th Amendment’s fourth and final section, which allows someone other than the president to make a finding of presidential disability. Section four authorizes the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet, or another body as determined by lawmakers, to declare a president ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."" Doing so would then elevate the vice president to the position of acting president. The president can restore his powers by declaring that no inability exists. However, the same body that initially transferred power to the vice president can respond by essentially doubling down on their declaration that the president is unable to discharge his duties. Then, if Congress, by a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate, agrees that the president is unable to serve, the vice president continues to act as president. Such a move could permanently strip a president of his powers — hence, why some legal analysts refer to section four as the ""involuntary removal mechanism."" The push for Congress to formalize a blueprint for handling presidential disability gained traction after President John F. Kennedy’s assassination on Nov. 22, 1963 (though lawmakers had first considered it much earlier in American history). ""The assassination of President Kennedy ... produced a flurry of additional proposals dealing with the subject,"" John D. Feerick wrote in a 1995 article in the Wake Forest Law Review. ""These proposals were influenced by the sense at that time that, if Kennedy had lived, the country would have had to deal with the problem of presidential inability in a most tragic setting."" As congressional hearings unfolded, little controversy surrounded the amendment’s first three sections, according to Feerick. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the real debate centered on when someone other than the president could declare him or her to be incapacitated. The amendment’s principal author, Sen. Birch Bayh, D.-Ind., embraced an understanding that presidential inability would encompass both physical and mental inability, said Joel Goldstein, a law professor at St. Louis University, who’s closely studied the congressional record. The formulation he adopted was put forth by Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., who said presidential inability ""involves physical or mental inability to make or communicate his decision regarding his capacity and physical or mental inability to exercise the powers and duties of his office."" Another important architect of the amendment, Rep. Richard Poff, R-Va., held a similar view, according to Goldstein. Poff said section four not only applied when the president, due to accident or illness, was unconscious or otherwise unable to make or communicate a decision, but also when ""the President, by reason of mental debility, is unable or unwilling to make any rational decision, including particularly the decision to stand aside."" On July 6, 1965, Congress formally proposed the 25th Amendment, and the necessary 38 states ratified it Feb. 10, 1967. Legal experts told us the drafters used intentionally vague and open-ended language (i.e., a president who is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."") because they recognized they couldn't predict every scenario in which a president could be deemed disabled. But despite the definition’s fuzziness, Goldstein said ""the record makes clear that section four was not intended as a means of removing the president simply because he or she makes an unpopular decision."" So did Schiff’s claim that the authors intended to cover physical incapacitation, serious mental illness and a general an inability to function, hit the mark? ""I think he’s right, as far as a one-sentence summary could have it,"" said Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University. ""They made the process and the terms flexible, but that was what they were mainly thinking of."" Schiff said, ""I think what the authors of the (25th) Amendment principally had in mind was some kind of physical incapacitation or serious mental illness or a breakdown, an inability to function in office."" The framers used deliberately broad language to allow for flexibility. But the record clearly shows they intended section four of the 25th Amendment to apply when a president is ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office"" due to either physical or mental inability, and not principally as a strategy for ousting an unpopular president.

Marco Rubio took three-quarters of a million from fossil fuel executives, heckler said
","A college student and climate activist interrupted U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio during a recent speech to question Rubio's ties to the energy industry. September Porras, a Swarthmore college student who is a member of the Sunrise Movement, a national group of climate change activists, challenged Rubio's links to fossil fuels at the Seminole County GOP fundraiser held at a hotel in Altamonte Springs on Aug. 22. Here is a partial transcript of the exchange: Porras: ""Senator, if you really care about young Americans, why did you take three-quarters of a million dollars from fossil fuel executives in your last Senate election?"" Rubio: ""I’m so glad I live in America where she can say that, in a lot of countries you go to jail, I am grateful that I live in America where ... (applause drowns out a few words) ... I don’t have a problem with protesters..."" Porras: ""I’m not a protester, I just want to know why you aren’t answering our questions."" Rubio: ""I don’t have a problem with hecklers. I don’t have a problem with any of that. You know why? Because one of the issues I am working on now involves nations where that’s not possible,"" a reference to his work related to U.S. policy on Cuba and Venezuela. ""I am grateful that I live in a nation where people can disagree, I am grateful that I live in a nation where people get to vote every two to four years. I am grateful that I live in a place where people can speak their minds and they can settle their differences at a ballot box."" Rubio then made a call for the United States to achieve energy independence: ""I believe as a cornerstone of allowing us to succeed economically we need to be able to power a 21st century economy, and I believe technological advances are making that energy more efficient and cleaner than ever before. I absolutely believe that America needs to be energy independent. We are crazy as a nation if we don’t utilize all of the resources that God’s blessed this great land with and I will continue to be a strong supporter of that."" The part of the exchange we will fact-check is whether Rubio took three-quarters of a million dollars from fossil fuel executives during his 2016 Senate bid. We did not hear back from Rubio’s spokespersons. Porras told PolitiFact that she obtained the dollar amount from the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent clearinghouse for campaign finance data that publishes its data at opensecrets.org. The center’s data for the top 20 recipients of oil and gas donations during the 2016 cycle showed that Rubio received $753,201. That amount put Rubio in fourth place for oil and gas donations behind three other presidential candidates: U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Separately, the center compiled industry donations for the Florida Senate candidates in 2016. That analysis shows that Rubio received $524,877 from oil and gas. Rubio received more money from six other sectors, including retirees, security/investment and Republican/conservative. Over Rubio’s career as a federal candidate and politician between 2009-18, he has taken $1.1 million from oil and gas. (Porras cited Rubio’s oil and gas donations but coal is also a fossil fuel. The Center of Responsive Politics found Rubio got $48,800 from the coal industry in 2016.) Compiling Rubio’s donations during the 2016 cycle is complicated because he ran in two elections -- presidential and Senate. The Center for Responsive Politics provided PolitiFact with a more specific breakdown for his oil and gas donations: $339,194 - to his presidential campaign $207,500 - to outside groups that supported both his presidential and Senate runs $271,571 - to his Senate campaign and leadership PAC That adds up to $818,265. That’s higher than the other totals shown for Rubio because it is the center’s most up to date analysis. So the dollar amount cited by Porras is valid, but while she referenced Rubio’s ""last Senate election"" the amount she cited included some donations to his presidential campaign. Another caveat: Porras said that the donations to Rubio were from ""executives"" but the donations could be broader than that. The donations reflects contributions from any individuals who list their employer as an oil and gas firm as well as as corporations and unions who donate from their treasuries. However, the vast majority of money reported to the Federal Election Commission comes from executives, CEOs and PACs, said Sarah Bryner, research director at the Center for Responsive Politics.   The donations don’t include external lobbyists who represent a whole host of interests, not just oil and gas, but it would include an in-house lobbyist for an oil company. Donations from the oil and gas industry have generally been increasing over the past decade, particularly in presidential cycles. The donations peaked at about $103 million in 2016, with about 88 percent going to Republican candidates. Rubio has previously called for the United States to become energy independent, and that includes the use of oil and gas. He criticized international climate efforts, as well as President Barack Obama’s regulatory measures. ""If you’re overly dependent on any one source of fuel, then you become vulnerable to disruption,"" he said at an event in January 2016. ""I want America to truly have a truly all-of-the-above strategy."" A heckler said that Rubio took ""three quarters of a million dollars from fossil fuel executives"" during the 2016 Senate election. While the heckler was referencing Rubio’s Senate election, that amount also includes donations to his presidential race. That's an important distinction, because presidential fundraising tends to draw more donations. The figure comes from an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics which found that Rubio received $753,201 during the 2016 cycle.  We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2017/aug/29/marco-rubios-heckler/marco-rubio-took-three-quarters-million-fossil-fue/

Arpaio falsely ties conviction to Obama administration
","President Donald Trump’s pardon of convicted former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio drew an immediate tweet of gratitude from the man he spared from a six-month jail term. ""Thank you @realdonaldtrump for seeing my conviction for what it is: a political witch hunt by holdovers in the Obama justice department,"" Arpaio wrote Aug. 25. Thank you @realdonaldtrump for seeing my conviction for what it is: a political witch hunt by holdovers in the Obama justice department! There is no question that Justice Department officials under President Barack Obama investigated and joined in legal proceedings against Arpaio, but were they driving the court process that led to his conviction on contempt of court? The court record and legal opinion say Arpaio is pointing at the wrong people. Arpaio’s path to a guilty verdict began with a 2007 traffic stop in Maricopa County. Under Arpaio, the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office used a few tactics to sweep up undocumented immigrants. They targeted places where day laborers came to find work. Deputies would follow the cars and trucks that picked them up and stop them. They had guidelines – called Law Enforcement Agency Response or LEAR – to stop any driver suspected of being in the country illegally. In 2007 Arpaio’s deputies detained Manuel de Jesus Ortega Melendres for nine hours. Melendres was a Mexican tourist with a valid tourist visa. Melendres sued on the basis of racial profiling. In 2011, federal district Judge G. Murray Snow issued a preliminary injunction, telling Arpaio and his department to stop detaining people without a reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed. Snow has no ties to the Obama administration. He was nominated by President George W. Bush in 2007. Snow followed up with a permanent injunction in 2013. ""Any stop or detention based only on a reasonable suspicion that a person is in the country without authorization, without more facts, is not lawful,"" Snow wrote. Arpaio’s practices, the judge wrote, violated peoples’ constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure and equal protection under law (the fourth and 14th amendments). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals backed up all the key elements of Snow’s ruling in 2015. During this time, Arpaio said in television interviews and statements to the press that he had no intention of changing his tactics. In 2016, Snow referred Arpaio for investigation of criminal contempt of court. The case went to Judge Susan Bolton on the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. Bolton, nominated by President Bill Clinton in 2000, heard testimony for five days. In her ruling, she said there was no question that Snow had issued a clear order, that Arpaio knew about the order and that he ""willfully violated the order."" ""Because the Court finds that Defendant willfully violated an order of the court, it finds Defendant guilty of criminal contempt,"" Bolton wrote. In his tweet, Arpaio argued that the hand of the Obama administration was at play. That overlooks the role of the courts, said law professor and federal criminal procedure expert Joshua Dressler at Ohio State University. ""The matter was entirely in the hands of Judge Bolton,"" Dressler said. ""With or without the Justice Department, the injunction existed."" Arpaio’s personal attorney largely agrees. ""Judge Snow kicked it off,"" said Jack Wilenchik. ""The government prosecutors could have declined to pursue the case, but then Snow would have brought in a private attorney to prosecute the case. There’s a rule about that."" The rule is Rule 42 on criminal contempt in the federal rules of criminal procedure. It says ""If the government declines the request, the court must appoint another attorney to prosecute the contempt."" The original case began with the Melendres suit, and a Bush-appointed judge referred the case for criminal prosecution. Another judge, appointed by Clinton, picked up the case. Starting in either mid 2008 or early 2009 (there are Justice Department statements giving both dates,) the Justice Department began its own investigation of Arpaio and his deputies. When the sheriff’s office refused to provide documents, the department sued to get them. The parties settled, and in December 2011, the Justice Department reported that it had determined that Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office were violating the Constitution and federal law. The Justice Department sued in 2012 and reached a partial settlement with Sheriff Arpaio and Maricopa County in July 2015. In effect, Arpaio faced two parallel legal challenges: one from the federal government and one from the Melendres case, which morphed into a class-action suit. They overlapped in substance, but were legally separate. In 2015, the Justice Department joined the Melendres case to press Maricopa County to obey the judge’s rulings. However, law professor Mark Osler at the University of St. Thomas said that did not make the department a party to the suit. ""Because they weren’t a party in the case, the Justice Department did not have the discretion and power they usually do — the power of controlling the charge,"" Osler said. ""That was in the hands of the judge."" Arpaio's attorney faulted the Obama Justice Department for its October 2016 announcement that it would move forward to prosecute Arpaio. ""That clearly hurt Sheriff Arpaio’s chances for re-election,"" Wilenchik said. Trump agrees. At a Aug. 28 news conference he complained that Arpaio had been unfairly treated by the Obama administration specifically related to the election. Arpaio said that his conviction for contempt of court was the result of a witch hunt by Obama administration Justice Department holdovers. The actual roots of the complaints that led to Arpaio’s conviction lie outside the Justice Department. A 2007 private lawsuit turned into a class action lawsuit that led a George W. Bush-era federal judge to issue an injunction against Arpaio and his department. Over several years, Arpaio publicly declared that he would not change his ways. The original judge referred Arpaio’s case for criminal prosecution and a Clinton-era judge found him guilty. The record, the law and legal opinion show the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona had control of the process, not Justice Department staff linked to the Obama administration.

It's fake news that Donald Trump pardoned Kentucky clerk Kim Davis
","President Donald Trump’s pardon of controversial former sheriff Joe Arpaio led to a fake news site falsely claiming Trump also pardoned a controversial government clerk from Kentucky. ""BREAKING: President Trump Pardons Kim Davis,"" read the headline on an Aug. 26, 2017, post on OurLandOfTheFree.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to cut down on fake news. The post appeared after Trump’s Aug. 25 pardon of Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz. Arpaio had been found guilty of criminal contempt after he continued to illegally profile Latinos against a judge’s orders. His sentencing was set for Oct. 5. Davis, meanwhile, was the Rowan County, Ken., clerk who had in 2015 refused to sign marriage licenses for same-sex couples on religious grounds, in defiance of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. A federal judge sent her to jail for five days for contempt of court for not complying with an order to issue the licenses. Her deputy clerks were eventually allowed to sign the licenses; Kentucky later took county clerks’ names off marriage licenses. She had faced three lawsuits for her refusal, but the suits had been dismissed. The same judge who jailed her later ruled that in one case, the state of Kentucky and not Davis was responsible for paying $225,000 in legal fees for the couple that brought the suit. So Davis can’t get a pardon, because technically she wasn’t convicted of a federal crime. But it doesn’t matter, because we know that the website that posted the story makes up all its content.

Illinois schools as immigrant ""sanctuaries?"" If only they read the bill
","As Gov. Bruce Rauner signed a new law defining state and local police officers’ roles in immigration matters, he praised it as a win for public safety and civil rights. ""Illinois has been welcoming of immigrants for a long time, and this bill will continue that tradition,"" Rauner said at an Aug. 28 signing ceremony in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood. ""It also makes clear that stopping violent crime will be law enforcement’s mission rather than working on federal prerogatives that a federal court has found illegal."" But Rauner’s statements at the signing of the Illinois Trust Act followed several weeks of heated rhetoric from opponents of the measure who saw it as turning Illinois into a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants. His initial expressions of support set off a firestorm of reaction from those who believe it is a threat to public safety. ""Governor Bruce Rauner has agreed to sign SB 31 into law — a bill that will make taxpayer funded facilities sanctuaries for people who are here illegally,"" said an Aug. 19 article on the website of the Illinois Family Institute, a conservative Christian group that headlines its mission as ""Boldly Bringing Biblical Perspectives to Public Policy."" The article later listed ""state-funded schools, including licensed day care centers, pre-schools, and other early learning programs; elementary and secondary schools, and institutions of higher education"" as facilities that ""will be made into sanctuaries by Bruce Rauner signing SB 31."" The criticism quickly went viral on social media.   By making Illinois a sanctuary state this am, @BruceRauner is slapping every citizen in the face.And he's guaranteeing his loss in 2018. The outcry from opponents of the new law raised questions similar to those of our Aug. 16 fact-check of Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ criticism of the Chicago Police Department’s policy on immigration enforcement. Though the Trust Act is now law in Illinois, social media remains littered with conjecture about what it means. So we thought it was worth a look at what’s in the law.
  When originally introduced in the General Assembly, SB 31 contained the language cited in the Illinois Family Institute article. It said that without a ""judicial warrant or probable cause of criminal activity… a government official shall not make arrests in the following State-funded facilities or their adjacent grounds: (1) State-funded schools, including licensed day care centers, pre-schools, and other early learning programs; elementary and secondary schools, and institutions of higher education."" It also prohibited arrests in state health facilities.

That version of the bill was 42 pages long. But it was replaced by an amended version on May 28. That means the language the Illinois Family Institute criticized had been stripped from the bill nearly three months earlier. The version Rauner signed  is only four pages long, and all of the language on arrests at public or publicly funded facilities has been deleted. It contains two directives for state and local police: Officers cannot detain people without a warrant from a judge and they can’t ""stop, arrest, search, detain, or continue to detain a person solely based on an individual's citizenship or immigration status."" State Rep. Emanuel Chris Welch, D-Chicago, who introduced the final version of the bill, said this amounts to ""basic due process rights that anyone would want."" Language about ""safe zones"" such as schools was removed at the request of law enforcement, Welch said. Also included in the bill was language explicitly to allow communication between local police and federal authorities, Welch said. Opponents also cite the bill’s prohibition of detaining suspects on administrative warrants from federal immigration authorities that are not issued by judges. These are known as immigration detainers and come from immigration agents, not state or federal judges. Local law enforcement supporters of SB 31 say that this section is necessary so they can earn the trust of immigrant communities. Lake County Sheriff Mark Curran, one of many law enforcement supporters of the bill, explained why in an Aug. 22 column by Mark Brown of the Chicago Sun-Times: ""In order to police these communities, protect these communities from the true predators, you have to be able to pull up with lights and all and not have widespread fear and panic among citizens that really have nothing to do with the crime."" An Aug. 25 post on the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police blog said the bill ""mostly puts into law what is current practice for local police departments: They don’t pull people over only to check their immigration status. They do respond to calls for service when people are the victims of crime or involved in an accident. They do want Illinois residents to call local police if someone is battered, in an accident, or burglarized."" Welch believes the controversy over the bill heated up after an Aug. 11 appearance by Rauner on Fox news host Bret Baier’s ""Special Report."" Baier quoted from an old version of the bill and put up graphics containing the ""safe haven"" language. Criticism intensified after Rauner appeared Aug. 18 on Chicago public radio station WBEZ’s ""Morning Shift"" program and voiced support. ""It’s supported by law enforcement, it’s supported by the business community, it’s supported by the immigration community,"" Rauner said. ""...It seems very reasonable."" When contacted on Aug. 25 about the actual language of the final bill, the author of the Illinois Family Institute article, John Biver, posted a correction. The new language did not temper his opposition. ""In truth, the language was not necessary since state and local law enforcement officers are prohibited from making any arrests anywhere in Illinois according to the guidelines of the statute,"" Bivers wrote in the correction. ""Focusing on the ‘state-funded facilities’ only made clearer the offensive nature of the law."" The Illinois Family Institute said public facilities including schools, colleges and day care centers ""will be made into sanctuaries by Bruce Rauner signing SB 31."" The original version of the bill prohibited police from making arrests in such facilities, but that language was struck from the version passed by the General Assembly. The new bill contains directives that the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police says merely puts into state statute what most departments already practice.

Which candidates for Buffalo mayor took money from top developers?
","Buffalo Democrats will choose among three candidates in the Sept. 12 mayoral primary. But, according to Erie County Legislator Betty Jean Grant, only one of them has not received money from two controversial Buffalo developers. ""I'm the only candidate who has not accepted money from Carl Paladino nor LPCiminelli; two of the biggest developers in the city of Buffalo,"" Grant told a local news station. ""The fact they have not contributed to my campaign gives me the freedom to be independent of any political strings attached to me."" Paladino, a major figure in Buffalo development, is the founder and chairman of Ellicott Development. LPCiminelli was run by Louis P. Ciminelli until his indictment on federal corruption charges in 2016 for allegedly rigging state construction bids. Ciminelli has since resigned. Grant, the underdog, faces Mayor Byron Brown, a three-term incumbent, and Mark Schroeder, the city’s comptroller. Brown had $582,167 in his campaign account at the most recent filing, more than four times what Schroeder had. Grant had $11,986. Is she right that she’s the only candidate who hasn’t taken money from Paladino or Ciminelli? Donations to Brown  Brown is the only candidate who has received donations from either developer since his last election in 2013. He received $2,500 from Louis Ciminelli in 2015. Brown has said he will set aside the donation from Ciminelli until the trial is resolved. William Paladino, Carl Paladino’s son, gave Brown $2,000 earlier this year. William Paladino, who is Carl's son, is the current chief executive officer of Ellicott Development and has worked at the company for more than two decades. Brown received a total of $12,000 from Ciminelli during his first and second terms. The company gave Brown $6,000 during those terms. Paladino contributed $100 to Brown’s campaign in 2013. William Paladino donated $500 the same year. Brown also used a second political committee to support other candidates during his first term. The account has not taken or spent money since 2009. Ciminelli donated $1,000 to the account between himself and his company. Brown did not receive donations from either developer when he was in the State Senate from 2001 to 2005. Donations to Schroeder Schroeder received $3,500 from Louis Ciminelli when he first ran for comptroller in 2011. Ciminelli gave him another $5,000 in 2015. Ellicott Development gave Schroeder $200 in 2011. William Paladino gave him $500 in 2012. Schroeder also served in the State Assembly from 2005 to 2011. He took $1,750 from Louis Ciminelli and $150 from Ellicott Development in that time. Donations to Grant Grant ran primary campaigns against State Sen. Tim Kennedy in 2012 and 2014. She did not receive any contributions from either Paladino or Ciminelli. Grant served on the Buffalo Common Council and Buffalo School Board before her election to the county legislature in 2007. Her filings for Common Council no longer exist. Local candidates were not required to file with the state Board of Elections at the time, and the Erie County Board of Elections was not required to hold on to the records after five years. So to the extent of what we know from state filings, Grant has not received money from either developer or their families. Our ruling Grant said she was the ""only candidate who has not accepted money from Carl Paladino nor LPCiminelli."" Because Carl Paladino is the chairman of Ellicott Development, and his son runs it as CEO, we included contributions from him, his son and the company in our rulling.   Grant did not specify a time frame. Her two rivals for the mayor's office have not received contributions from either developer during the current campaign. But we understood her to mean contributions during their entire political careers.   Filings show Grant is the only candidate who has not received money from either developer. Brown is the only candidate to take money from both since 2013. We rate her statement True.",/factchecks/2017/aug/25/betty-jean-grant/which-candidates-mayor-took-money-top-buffalo-deve/

Scott Walker misleads saying Pennsylvania lost Foxconn plant because Democrat replaced GOP governor
","Critics of Wisconsin’s $3 billion-for-13,000 jobs deal with Foxconn keep bringing up Pennsylvania. In 2013, the Taiwanese manufacturer promised a $30 million factory in the Harrisburg area that would employ 500 people. There were big headlines, but the factory was never built. Asked by a reporter on July 28, 2017 why Foxconn wouldn't do the same to Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker responded by saying the difference is simple: ""Pennsylvania changed governors."" The Republican governor has since repeated that explanation in at least three other interviews -- with Wisconsin reporters, on conservative talk radio in Milwaukee and on the Fox Business Network. ""Our understanding from the company is that Pennsylvania wanted to change the deal"" with Foxconn"" after a new governor was elected,"" Walker spokesman Tom Evenson told us when we asked for information to back Walker’s statement.

Pennsylvania did replace a Republican governor with a Democrat. But that election occurred a year after the factory announcement -- and in that time, virtually no progress on the factory had been reported under the GOP governor. After Foxconn made its announcement, ""it was very, very quiet, then it just kind of faded away,"" recalled Jay Pagni, who was a spokesman for then-Republican Gov. Tom Corbett. We heard the same from Nathan Benefield, chief operating officer at the Commonwealth Foundation in Pennsylvania, which monitors government incentive packages to businesses. And we heard it from local news reporters and others. Steven Kratz, who was spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development under Corbett, told us that when Corbett left office in January 2015, the state and Foxconn were continuing to have talks about the proposed plant. But no site had been chosen and no agreement had been made on any incentives the state might offer, he said. And for its part, Foxconn has given different explanations for not building the Pennsylvania plant. In short, the explanation isn’t as simple as Walker makes it, as the following review shows. Foxconn-Pennsylvania timeline Nov. 2013 Announcement: Foxconn and Corbett announce Foxconn plans to invest $30 million in a factory that would employ up to 500. Jan. 2014 Initial plans: Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development spokesman says he expects Foxconn to do aggressive site search, starting in January 2014. Feb. 2014 Questions arise: Weeks later, news reports say only that Foxconn might invest in Pennsylvania; and that there was intense competition among states for a Foxconn plant. Nov. 2014 Change in governors: Businessman Tom Wolf, a Democrat, defeats Corbett to win election as governor. Wolf takes office in January 2015. Jan. 2017 Sites had been scouted: Reflecting on the 2013 announcement, a Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development spokeswoman in the Wolf administration says department officials had met with Foxconn representatives on various occasions after the 2013 announcement and showed them potential locations for the planned site, but the project didn’t materialize. (The department confirmed to us it worked with Foxconn under both the Corbett and Wolf administrations.) Mar. 2017 Foxconn takes responsibility: The Washington Post reports that, according to a Harrisburg-area official, the project ""just seemed to fade to black"" after it was announced. ""It was the start of a mystery, created by a chief executive known to promise projects all over the world that never quite pan out,"" according to the Post. Foxconn attributes the failure to build the factory to ""material changes to the business and operating climate at that time."" Aug. 2017 Foxconn blames Pennsylvania: The China Post reports that Foxconn chairman Terry Gou has said the plant wasn’t built because, in the Post’s words, Pennsylvania ""elected a new governor who refused to honor the deal."" Our rating Walker says Foxconn didn't keep a promise to build a plant in Pennsylvania because ""Pennsylvania changed governors."" But the record indicates that by the time the Democratic administration took over, little progress had been made more than a year after Foxconn and the GOP governor announced Foxconn’s plans. It's not as though there was a deal in place that fell apart after the election. Foxconn, meanwhile, has given explanations ranging from ""material changes to the business and operating climate at that time,"" to Pennsylvania not making an economically viable to proposal to, reportedly, blaming Pennsylvania’s change in governors. In short, Walker’s statement contains an element of truth, but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False. 5 fact checks on Foxconn and Wisconsin's $3 billion deal  ",/factchecks/2017/aug/25/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-pennsylvania-lost-foxconn-plant-/

Rick Baker wrongly says new police headquarters is over budget
","All summer long, Rick Baker has hammered opponent and current Mayor Rick Kriseman over what he sees as exorbitant spending on the new pier and new police station. In a Tampa Bay Times article on June 14, Baker said: ""To me it's all about quality of life. Whether it's dog parks, skate board parks, rec centers ... And the trouble is, if you're $35 million over budget on the Pier and $35 million over budget on a police station, it's very hard to do that stuff."" Kriseman, on the other hand, argued the police station is under budget and ahead of schedule — a premature statement that we rated Mostly False. Here, we wanted to test Baker’s claim that the city is over budget on the police station. Plans for a new police station have been in the works since Baker was mayor more than a decade ago. The city’s police building on 1300 First Ave. N. was built in multiple phases, with the first part unveiled in 1951 and the other in 1978. Baker argues the current budget is way more than what was originally determined in 2006, when he was in his second term. The estimate to replace the police station came in at $50 million, according to the Tampa Bay Times. The latest price tag to replace the aging station is $86 million. That’s about $35 million higher than the 2006 estimate. Contrary to Baker’s point, the expected price hike does not prove dramatic cost overruns driven by the current mayor. Baker’s point essentially compares two different projects, holding Kriseman to an estimate that low-balled the expected costs and obviously pre-dated him. The city knew years before Kriseman became mayor that it would take more than $50 million to replace police headquarters. In 2010, a consultant hired by the city unveiled a report detailing that St. Petersburg needed to spend $74 million to replace its police headquarters. Given the state of the economy, city officials knew the $74 million price tag was too steep. ""I don't think we can afford this,"" said City Council member Karl Nurse in 2010. As the economic downturn set in, the city looked at other options, including building a scaled-down version while making updates to the old facility. However, after the economy picked back up, Kriseman announced in 2015 the city would have enough money to build a new station again for $70 million. After the budget was set at $70 million (a decision approved by the City Council 7-1), additional costs were added for parking, energy efficient features, and a new shooting range, bringing the final budget for new police facilities to $86 million. Here’s how the budget changed over the years: To Baker, this does not matter. ""The bottom line is the budget was $50 million dollars for the police station, anything the department needed, should have been built into that initial $50 million dollar budget, period,"" said Rick Baker. ""The fact that Kriseman is playing budgetary games does not hide the fact that, as documented by the Tampa Bay Times on multiple occasions, he is on a ‘spending binge,’ and is tens of millions of dollars over budget on the police station project."" Budget adjustments are not synonymous with being over budget, though. The city is not yet anticipating to spend more than what the council approved. The city says it has spent $4 million towards the construction of the project, which started in late spring. Construction costs eat up the majority of the budget, at $61 million. The rest of the spending is for architecture, planning and other services related to the pre-development of the project. City officials estimated the project will be done in December 2018, and fully operational in spring 2019. Baker is not alone in criticizing the added features cooked into the final project. His staff highlighted how the Tampa Bay Times editorial board criticized Kriseman’s spending on the police station and pier. The editorial does not call the police project over budget. Our ruling  Baker said that the new police headquarters is over budget. Baker considers the budget for the police department to be $50 million, which was the amount that was originally set aside in 2006 when he was mayor. However, before Kriseman took office, a consultant said the city would need $74 million to build a new police headquarters. With the addition of features such as a shooting range and a parking garage, the project’s expected cost is now $86 million. Baker’s insistence that Kriseman should have stuck to a budget developed 11 years ago ignores the changed expectations before Kriseman took office. Moreover, the city is not far enough along on the project to say that it is over budget. So far, there’s no indication that the city is spending more than what the council approved. Baker’s statement is inaccurate. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2017/aug/25/rick-baker/former-mayor-rick-baker-wrongly-says-new-police-he/

No, Kelli Ward isn't a chemtrails conspiracy theorist
","A pro-Republican super PAC with close ties to Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., launched an attack ad against U.S. Senate candidate Kelli Ward, R-Ariz., portraying her as a conspiracy theorist. The Arizona Senate race is picking up national attention after President Donald Trump criticized incumbent Sen. Jeff Flake as ""weak on crime & border!"" on Twitter. A pro-Trump super PAC is spending $20,000 on Ward, who has cribbed the president’s style in her campaign to ""make Arizona great again."" The physician served two terms in the Arizona state Senate and lost a 2016 challenge for Sen. John McCain’s seat. The McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund is stepping up for Flake with a 77-second video that knocked Ward as ""Chemtrail Kelli"" four times. ""Ward wasted your tax dollars for a town hall on chemtrail conspiracy theories,"" the attack ad posted Aug. 22, 2017, says. ""Sponsoring chemtrail legislation? ‘I’m open, I introduce legislation for constituents all the time.’ About another chemtrail town hall? ‘I’ll do it again. Of course I’ll do it again.’ Chemtrail Kelli’s got her head in the clouds with crazy ideas."" We decided to take a closer look at the links the video made between Ward and chemtrails. The video is correct in saying that Ward hosted a town hall on the issue. But the ad ignores her record of saying she does not believe in the theory. In the conspiracy world, chemtrails are chemical or biological agents dispersed by aircrafts as part of a government plot to control the weather and human behavior. But scientists generally agree that the cloud-like formations that linger in an aircraft’s trail are basically condensation marks. In June 2014, Ward invited constituents of her state Senate district to a small, informational seminar on chemtrails by two Arizona Department of Environmental Quality staffers in Kingman, Ariz. Some audience members then provided testimony and asked questions of the staffers and Ward. ""The town hall was conducted in response to constituent concerns, and experts were brought in to directly refute those concerns,"" Ward’s spokeswoman Jennifer Lawrence said. The ad plucked quotes that made Ward seem like a conspiracy theorist herself. The full quote from her closing remarks at the town hall about being ""open"" to sponsoring legislation to investigate chemtrails is more nuanced. ""With this particular issue I think it’s going to be very difficult because, unless you get away from the chemtrail issue that you all are so passionate about, talking about our environmental quality I think can go further in terms of making sure that there aren’t any public health issues that are out there with our water, our soil, or our air,"" Ward said. Ward has repeatedly said she doesn’t subscribe to this belief. ""I don’t believe in the chemtrail theory,"" she told Politico in 2015. She explained in a 2016 radio interview that she considers it her duty as an elected official to respond to her constituents. The attack ad singled out a snippet of the interview of Ward. ""About another chemtrail town hall?"" the video asks. ""I’ll do it again. Of course I’ll do it again."" Again, a later part of the interview talks about the need to listen to constituents. ""People say, well, would you do it again? Of course I'll do it again because that’s what you’re supposed to do when you’re elected,"" Ward said. ""You’re supposed to listen to the people and you’re supposed to get them the information that they need to feel confident that they live in a safe environment."" A Senate Leadership Fund ad said Ward hosted a town hall on chemtrails and was willing to sponsor legislation on it. Calling Ward ""Chemtrail Kelli"" repeatedly and saying she has her ""head in the clouds with crazy ideas"" wrongly suggests she believes in the conspiracy theory. Ward did host a town hall on chemtrails, but she has not expressed belief in chemtrails. She has not held further town halls or sponsored any legislation on the topic.

Joker origin story draws out the geek in CNN's Jake Tapper (and us, too)
","For Batman fans, the history of the Joker is no laughing matter.

Not true, you obviously never heard of the RED HOOD. pic.twitter.com/Azf5AEHyPo The page shows the Joker telling Batman how he once had been a laboratory worker who attempted to steal $1 million from the Monarch Playing Card Company. He made his escape by swimming through chemical waste, which turned his skin white and his hair green. He took his name from the eponymous playing card and has been arching Batman ever since. But something sounded off to this fact-checker, who thought Shapiro had a point about the Joker’s past being mysterious. PolitiFact has written about whether there’s been a female Thor, and whether Wonder Woman’s Gal Gadot or Man of Steel’s Henry Cavill is paid more money, so we have some experience. In true geek fashion, we raised this objection with Tapper, saying that the Red Hood origin story was just the one with which people were most familiar. ""Because it's the true one,"" Tapper replied. Because it's the true one We’ll see about that. The most succinct reply to this came from Nick Valente, a publicist for DC Comics. ""You are correct, there is no definitive backstory for the Joker,"" he said. CASE CLOSED! But wait! Like most comic book plotlines, there’s always room for this story to expand and change. The Joker has been around almost as long as Batman himself, first appearing in 1940s Batman No. 1, when the Dark Knight got his own title after starting in Detective Comics a year earlier. There have been several iterations of the character, but through the decades he has been portrayed largely as a psychotic killer, bent on antagonizing Batman and the people of Gotham City. The Joker had no backstory to speak of until 1951, when the anecdote about the Red Hood that Tapper cited was printed. Versions of this origin have appeared in various forms over the years, with details changed. Glen Weldon, author of The Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture‎, said that DC gave the character an origin story, but that was ""back in the halcyon days before a ravenous fanbase insisted that every random story must calcify into canonical truth."" One of the most famous modern versions of the Red Hood story is Alan Moore’s account in 1988’s The Killing Joke, in which the Joker is a former engineer and failed comedian who leads armed robbers into his former employer, Ace Chemical Processing, Inc., after the death of his pregnant wife. He wears the Red Hood as a disguise and jumps into the chemicals to flee Batman. But that doesn’t mean we should believe the Joker, because, well, he’s the Joker. He’s an unreliable narrator, because his insanity keeps him from telling the truth, and us from knowing the difference. Even Moore’s version of the Joker acknowledged that his story is essentially unknowable. ""Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another,"" the Joker said. ""If I’m going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"" There are plenty of other variations of the story. Sometimes Batman knocks the Joker into the vat, sometimes the hapless criminal jumps. Sometimes the Red Hood isn’t involved at all. Later storylines show that the Red Hood is an alias adopted by many other criminals. Eventually, even Batman’s sidekick Robin dons the Red Hood. ""Since that (1951) story was first published, just about every time any comic's made even the most casual reference to Joker's origin, the Red Hood bit has come and gone, but the ‘fall into a vat of acid, goes nuts’ thing remains,"" Weldon said. The movies complicate things further. In the 1989 film version of Batman, Jack Nicholson’s Joker is a lifelong criminal named Jack Napier (the only time the Joker is given a first and last name) who actually is the man who killed Bruce Wayne’s parents. The late Heath Ledger’s acclaimed 2008 take on the Joker in The Dark Knight gives a nod to the ambiguity of it all, with the grease-painted antagonist telling different characters more than one version of how he was disfigured. (There’s also an offshoot movie based on Jared Leto’s tattooed Joker and Harley Quinn from 2016’s Suicide Squad coming, but that’s a different set of issues altogether.) DC Comics recognizes that their most famous villain juggles the truth. Their Origin of the Joker showed the killer acknowledging that even he gets confused by which story is right. 
""Though the Red Hood story — in its blurriest form of spills and chemical burns — is perhaps the most-pointed to origin story for the Joker, it is by no means the definitive one,"" said Brad Ricca, SAGES Fellow at Case Western Reserve University and a comics historian. Recent comic book storylines have suggested that Batman has actually matched wits with three different Jokers through the years. Other stories hint further that the Joker may be immortal. The character has cycled through several personalities and backstories, sometimes insane and sometimes not, but always a dark-humored and lethal opponent for Batman. That’s the strength of comic books, which are free to retroactively change the continuity however the creators see fit, our experts said. Will Brooker, a film and cultural studies professor at Kingston University, said that the most sinister aspect of the character is that inability to define how he became the way he is. ""My feeling is that to pin Joker down to a fixed backstory and identity is reductive, unimaginative and suggests a lack of understanding of what Joker is really about,"" said Brooker, author of Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon. ""He is essentially the opposite of Batman, who has a fixed, definite origin. The whole point is that Batman can never work out who Joker is and where he came from."" Tapper said the Joker's ""Red Hood"" origin story is ""the true one."" That's right, we're fact-checking where the Joker came from. So sue us! This claim is throwing down the gauntlet for comic book nerds, pointing to a 1951 backstory about the Joker wearing a disguise and swimming through chemical waste as the one, true origin of the archvillain. He may prefer that version, and that’s fine, because it’s not wrong. But comic historians and even a DC Comics publicist we consulted agreed that the Joker has no definitive backstory — indeed, that is one of the defining strengths of the character.

Pants on Fire! Paul Ryan uses old stat to claim counties will have no Obamacare insurer in 2018
","Republicans leading the charge to repeal Obamacare say their primary motivation is to save Americans from a program that has failed them. That was House Speaker Paul Ryan’s main argument during a CNN town hall broadcast on health care. ""Obamacare is not working,"" Ryan said Aug. 21. ""A third of the counties in Wisconsin are down to one insurer right here. We've got dozens of counties around America that have zero insurers left. So doing nothing really isn't an option."" Ryan has a point about limited competition, but his statement about dozens of counties without a single carrier recycles an old talking point that was never fully right and has become completely wrong today. The Affordable Care Act set up exchanges where people in the non-group market buy private insurance. The latest official report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is that 47 percent of counties are expected to have just one participating insurer in 2018. But central to Ryan’s claim, that report also said that just one county is at risk of having no carrier next year. Here’s the map:  So not dozens of counties -- just one. Now technically, that report wasn’t published until two days after Ryan spoke. But the government had the information, and a day before Ryan spoke, Politico reported that just one county remained without a potential insurance carrier in 2018. The Kaiser Family Foundation published the same information the day of Ryan’s CNN town hall. And a week earlier, the government said there were only two counties at risk of having no participating insurer. Ryan was way off no matter what. Ryan's office said he should have said it was projected to be the case. By the way, on Aug. 24, the last remaining place -- Paulding County in Ohio -- got an insurance company. So that leaves no counties without a carrier on the exchange next year. There’s been a lot of shifting in the exchange landscape. Insurance companies were assessing whether to participate in counties and entire states for 2018. Some places that looked safe suddenly found themselves at risk. Others that were at risk found new companies moving in. At the high point, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said 49 counties had no declared carrier for 2018. Here’s how things jumped around between June 9 and Aug. 23: We asked a couple of health insurance industry observers what was going on. Equity analyst Lance Wilkes at Sanford C. Bernstein said what we’re seeing is a learning curve in action. ""All the managed-care companies were figuring out this market, learning about the customer as well the rules of this program,"" Wilkes said. Wilkes said that in 2014, some large companies such as UnitedHealthcare jumped into the Affordable Care Act exchanges when there was a worry that large employers might shed coverage, sending millions of people into the exchanges. ""They needed to be in as sort of a hedge against that,"" he said. ""When that didn’t happen, they got out."" But other insurers started to carve out a niche and came in to fill the gap in stranded counties. The Centene Corporation has been particularly aggressive in Nevada and Missouri. Between the two states, it is poised to offer plans in 39 counties that at some point had no takers. Centene has a different approach than many larger carriers. It has a long history of managing state Medicaid programs where it trims expenses by contracting with a smaller group of health care providers. That can work for lower-income clients who don’t come with the expectation that they will be able to see any doctor they want. ""It’s a trade off,"" said Cynthia Cox, who tracks the insurance industry at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""They offer a lower-cost plan but it doesn’t have as many doctors in the network. That doesn't seem to have been a problem for them and their customers."" Wilkes said it also helps that state insurance commissioners are motivated to attract carriers and are ""more willing to offer good price increases,"" which about 85 percent of the policy holders won’t feel because the government subsidizes their premiums. For companies such as Centene, this makes the market relatively predictable. ""They might be sicker than average, but so long as the healthy people aren’t priced out, you have a pool that’s stable, and you can price for that,"" said Wilkes. Other companies in other states have also figured that out. Tennessee was looking at 16 counties that lacked any insurance carrier for next year. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee decided in May to cover them. In a letter to the state insurance commissioner, the company said it could do that because it was doing better, with lower claims ""and a more sustainable rate structure."" Ryan said dozens of counties have no insurers left on the Obamacare exchanges. The day he said that, there was only one such county. Less than a week before he said that, there were two counties. His office acknowledged that he misspoke. Ryan has established himself as an architect of health care reform in the House and the viewers of CNN’s town hall would expect him to have his facts straight.
