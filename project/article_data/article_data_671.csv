Would trio of West Coast states be '5th largest economy' on planet? 
","Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles and 2018 Democratic candidate for California governor, recently called for the state to unite with like-minded cities and states on the West Coast to oppose ""dangerous policies advanced by a Trump administration."" California’s large economy, Villaraigosa said in a Dec. 8, 2016 op-ed in the Sacramento Bee, gives it leverage in any possible showdown. In making this call, Villaraigosa repeated a favorite claim by California politicians that the state’s economy ranks as the sixth largest in the world -- a claim PolitiFact California rated Mostly True in July. He then took the economic comparison further -- all the way to the Pacific Northwest. ""California is once again the sixth-largest economy in the world,"" Villaraigosa said. ""If you add the GDP’s of Washington and Oregon, California would surpass the United Kingdom to become the fifth-largest economy in the world."" ""That’s power – power we must use to protect our people against any dangerous policies advanced by a Trump administration,"" he added. We decided to fact-check the part of Villaraigosa’s claim that if the GDPs of California, Washington and Oregon were somehow combined, they’d represent the fifth largest economy on the planet, ahead of the United Kingdom. Gross domestic product, or GDP, is used to measure the health of a country’s or state’s economy. It’s the total value of all goods and services. Our research A campaign spokeswoman for Villaraigosa pointed us to 2015 GDP figures from the International Monetary Fund. We used the same data in July to verify that California, with a GDP of nearly $2.5 trillion, had the sixth-largest economy behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom.  California Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration released GDP figures in June showing the state had jumped two spots in these unique world rankings ahead of France and Brazil and into sixth place behind the United Kingdom. In our July fact check, we noted that when adjusted for California’s very high cost of living, the state’s GDP drops several places. This led us to our Mostly True rating for the claim, which we define as ""accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" To come up with a combined GDP for three West Coast states, we added California’s nearly $2.5 trillion to Oregon’s $217 billion and Washington’s $445 billion, using 2015 figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.  Together, their GDPs add up to $3.1 trillion. This hypothetical West Coast powerhouse economy would be larger than the United Kingdom’s $2.8 trillion GDP. Villaraigosa’s claim, however, needs the same disclaimer about high cost of living. California, Oregon and Washington are all expensive places to live. We realize Villaraigosa’s comparison is hypothetical -- and it looks like he got his numbers right. But to do this, he creates a fictional California economy that magically annexes the GDPs of two nearby states. Our ruling Antonio Villaraigosa recently said: ""California is once again the sixth-largest economy in the world. If you add the GDP’s of Washington and Oregon, California would surpass the United Kingdom to become the fifth-largest economy in the world."" We rated the first portion of this claim Mostly True in a separate fact check in July. We crunched the numbers on the second part of Villaraigosa’s claim, about a combined and hypothetical California-Oregon-Washington economy. At $3.1 trillion, it would surpass the United Kingdom’s $2.8 trillion GDP and would rank fifth in the world. It’s important to note that some economists factor in cost-of-living when assessing a state’s or country’s GDP. Expenses are high in all three states, which means this mega-economy could be knocked down a few spots in the rankings. The former mayor’s statement needs this clarification. Overall, we rate Villaraigosa’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b83a74d-fde6-48d9-9c72-c93824f92b4e",/factchecks/2016/dec/15/antonio-villaraigosa/villaraigosa-claims-california-oregon-washington-p/

Did Rex Tillerson, oil CEO and secretary of state pick, sue to keep fracking out of own backyard?
","Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state, doesn’t have a problem with fracking until it affects him, says a consumer rights group. ""ExxonMobil is a major player in the fracking industry, and #ExxonKnew climate change was a problem for decades, but covered up the evidence,"" reads a campaign letter from Food & Water Watch. ""Tillerson infamously sued to keep a fracking project out of his backyard, but seems happy to profit off fracking in other people's backyards."" For this fact-check, we wanted to know if the head of the largest natural gas-producing company in the United States really said no fracking way to a drilling project in his own neighborhood. Food & Water Watch is right about Tillerson’s participation in the natural gas litigation, though its account misses a few details. Fracking-caused noise and traffic was one of many concerns listed in the lawsuit. Tillerson’s lawyer also told the Wall Street Journal that Tillerson himself cared the most about property devaluation. And the oil chief dropped out of the lawsuit after receiving attention for it. In 2012, Tillerson, his wife and their neighbors in Bartonville, Texas, sued to block the construction of a 160-foot water tower in their luxury community. The tower would, in part, supply water for hydraulic fracturing — which injects pressurized water as well as sand and chemicals under shale rock formations to extract natural gas.    The lawsuit contended the project violates the town’s zoning ordinance and will also be an ""unbearable nuisance."" ""A water tower will have lights on at all hours of the night, traffic to and from the tower at unknown and unreasonable hours, noise from mechanical and electrical equipment needed to maintain and operate the water tower, and creates and (sic) unsafe and unattractive nuisance to the children of the area,"" the suit reads. ""Furthermore, upon information and belief, (the Bartonville Water Supply Corporation) will sell water to oil and gas explorers for fracing shale formations leading to traffic with heavy trucks on FM 407, creating a noise nuisance and traffic hazards,"" it continues. In addition to joining the lawsuit, Tillerson sat for a three-hour deposition in May 2013 and protested the project at a town council meeting that November, according to the Journal’s report in February 2014. But the newspaper noted that Tillerson wasn’t ""the most vocal or well-known opponent of the tower."" That distinction belonged to the lead plaintiffs, former U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey and his wife. Environmentalists jumped on the story, with plenty pointing out the irony and hypocrisy but embracing Tillerson into their ranks. A former oil executive penned an open letter to Tillerson on NoFrackingWay.Us decrying the environmental impacts of the practice and wishing him ""good luck with that fracking water tank."" Credo Action, an online hub of progressive activists, dubbed Tillerson ""the highest-profile anti-fracking activist in the world."" And MoveOn.org offered Tillerson its ""FrackingFighter"" award. Under pressure and after a judge dismissed the claims, Tillerson dropped out of the lawsuit two months later in April 2014, the Dallas Business Journal reported. The Armeys and a few others continued to pursue legal action over the project, and the battle continued into at least November 2015, the last mention of the case we could find. Our ruling Food & Water Watch said Tillerson ""sued to keep a fracking project out of his backyard."" Tillerson joined a lawsuit that listed noise nuisance and traffic hazards among the plaintiffs’ many concerns, though he later dropped out of the litigation.

Website makes dubious claim that GOP will cut Social Security by 50% 'immediately'
","A newly introduced bill to overhaul Social Security has prompted a wave of urgent appeals to current and future Social Security beneficiaries to prevent the program from being gutted. A reader noticed an Internet post being widely shared and asked us if it was accurate. The post in question, from a website called the New Century Times, is headlined, ""Republicans Looking To Cut Social Security As Much As 50% Immediately."" A 50 percent monthly benefit cut starting ""immediately"" would indeed be a serious problem for a lot of Social Security beneficiaries. However, the primary article the post linked to doesn’t support the headline, and a related article provides only weak support. The New Century Times post links to a column by Josh Marshall, the editor and publisher of the liberal news and commentary website Talking Points Memo. The column analyzes a bill offered by Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, that would raise the retirement age for Americans 49 or younger from 67 to 69, change the formula for determining a beneficiary’s first payments, and effectively reduce their future cost-of-living adjustments. ""Republicans apparently aren’t going to be satisfied with phasing out Medicare,"" Marshall wrote. ""They’re going to try to pass huge cuts to Social Security this year too. Not Bush-style partial phase-out, but just big, big cuts. And you’re out of luck even if you’re a current beneficiary."" But Marshall’s column doesn’t say the cuts will be ""50 percent immediately,"" and the New Century Times article never provides any other backing for it. (A side note: The author of the New Century Times article is Sarah Wood, who is the creator of a satirical website called the Free Wood Post. However, she writes separately for the New Century Times, according to her Twitter biography, and we have no reason to believe that the Social Security article is intended as satire. Wood did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Adding to the confusion, the New Century Times separately quotes a statement by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that says the Johnson bill ""cuts benefits by more than a third"" -- not 50 percent. We didn’t hear back from Johnson’s staff, but we did find a different Talking Points Memo piece that could be the source of the 50 percent figure. This article offers a number of scenarios exploring how the Johnson bill could affect particular beneficiaries, depending on how much income they make, when they retire and how long they live. A number of the examples in the Talking Points Memo article show increases well below 50 percent. ""A 65-year-old retiree (who earned an average of $12,280 and) was only in the workforce for 20 years would see a 19 percent decrease … in 2030,"" the article said. ""That cut would be 32 percent, if the 65-year-old was retiring in 2050."" Some examples even show increases. ""A 65-year-old who made an average of $12,280 ... after being in the workforce for 30 years would see his benefits increase by 9 percent when he retired in 2030, as compared to the current law,"" the article said. But some examples do show decreases in excess of 50 percent. Specifically, the Talking Points Memo article says, ""a 65-year-old at the top of the scale, a $118,500 average earner, would see his benefits cut by 25 percent when he retired in 2030, compared to the current law, and that reduction would grow to 55 percent compared to current law by the time the retiree was 85 years old. Likewise, those cuts get larger the longer the law is in place. The 65 year-old at the top of scale who retires in 2050 will see a 43 percent cut in his benefits, compared to current law, that will grow to a 74 percent reduction by the time he is 85."" Clearly, cuts of 55 percent or 74 percent are significant. But a lot of important context was lost between the Talking Points Memo article and the New Century Times headline that got so much attention on social media feeds. First, these are very specific examples; many other beneficiaries would experience far less severe effects. The New Century Times headline leaves the impression that this would be an across-the-board cut. Second, these specific examples happen to be clustered among new retirees at the top of the income scale, meaning they would be more able to afford the cuts. Some low earners, as we saw, actually come out ahead in the calculations. Third, these cuts would be about as far from ""immediate"" as one can imagine. No one currently receiving Social Security or about to start receiving benefits would experience a 50 percent benefit cut -- the most logical way to read the headline. Rather, in the example with the 55 percent cut, that would take full effect in 2050. In the example with the 74 percent cut, that would take full effect in 2070. For a sense of context, lots of Gen-Xers would have reached, or would soon reach, 100 years old by 2070. Our ruling A widely shared New Century Times post was headlined, ""Republicans Looking To Cut Social Security As Much As 50% Immediately."" A recently released bill would indeed raise the retirement age and make changes to Social Security formulas that would effectively cut future benefits for many recipients. But by highlighting cuts as large as 50 percent without noting that these are for a specific (and affluent) subset of beneficiaries, the headline engages in extreme cherry picking. And none of these massive cuts would happen immediately -- they would happen 34 and 54 years in the future. This claim revives a well-honed Social Security scare tactic. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2016/dec/14/new-century-times/website-makes-dubious-claim-gop-will-cut-social-se/

Bloggers revive false claim that House Democrats strike to impose Sharia law
","Several websites continue to insist without a shred of evidence that Democrats in the U.S. House have attempted to enact Sharia law, the religious guidelines of Islam. ""THIS IS TREASON!!"" exclaimed one headline we saw on Dec. 12, 2016. ""House DEMOCRATS STRIKE To IMPLEMENT SHARIA LAW!!"" A Dec. 12 Facebook post linked to an undated story that referred to a third outlet going back to December 2015. First of all, there was no strike, either as a work stoppage or an attack. The citations refer to the Dec. 17, 2015, introduction of HR 569, which sought to support Muslim-Americans and denounce hate crimes and persecution. One story we found online said the resolution ""threatens to restrict our right to even report facts that tarnish Islam’s reputation, a law that all Sharia-governed countries already have in place."" Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings, but Muslims differ on its interpretation. PolitiFact has checked a string of complaints about efforts to institute Sharia law (or aspects of it) in the United States — most recently by retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the potential future national security adviser of President-elect Donald Trump. But the resolution, introduced by U.S. Rep. Donald Beyer of Virginia, did not seek to institute Sharia law, or any law, for that matter. The resolution was non-binding, meaning it did not have the effect of law, and was introduced to address an upswing in anti-Muslim sentiment. HR 569 has 145 co-sponsors, all of whom are Democrats. Some online stories distorted what the bill would do by saying it ""will serve as a test by which further criminalizing of ‘Islamophobia’ may be introduced"" and single out only Muslims as worthy of special protection. Some websites said the resolution would equate hate speech with violence, and that would potentially alter constitutional rights. But HR 569 ""declares that the civil rights and civil liberties of all United States citizens, including Muslims in the United States, should be protected and preserved."" The resolution denounces ""the increase of hate speech, intimidation, violence, vandalism, arson, and other hate crimes targeted against mosques, Muslims, or those perceived to be Muslim."" It also ""steadfastly confirms its dedication to the rights and dignity of all its citizens of all faiths, beliefs, and cultures."" There’s no threat of new legal reprisal for intolerance against Muslims, only that Congress would officially disapprove of such behavior. The aim was for Congress to show support for ""the inalienable right of every citizen to live without fear and intimidation, and to practice their freedom of faith."" The resolution was referred to committee. With no Republican co-sponsors in the GOP-controlled House, it likely will not see any further action. Our ruling Bloggers said, ""House Democrats strike to implement Sharia law!!"" There was no kind of strike. Instead, the stories referred to a non-binding resolution introduced in December 2015 that sought to affirm congressional support for Muslim-Americans facing hate crimes and persecution. It did not have the effect of law or mention Sharia law, but rather aimed to send a message that anti-Muslim sentiment would not be tolerated by members of the U.S. House. The resolution has not received any Republican support and is likely dead. Wanting Congress to officially condemn hate speech and persecution is not the same as seeking to institute Sharia law.

"['Government Regulation', 'PunditFact', 'Conservative Tribune']","
Website wrongly says Obama plans to take $3,000 from every American
","President Barack Obama is nearly out the door, but that hasn’t stopped the Internet from raising alarm bells about his policies. A recent post in a website called Conservative Tribune is headlined, ""OUTRAGE: Before Leaving, Obama Enacts Rules to Take $3,000 From EVERY American."" Other sites repeated this line, including Maine Republic Email Alert, Allen West, Young Conservatives, and Angry Patriot (which amped up the allegation by calling it ""CORRUPT""). A reader asked us to delve deeper, so we did. (Conservative Tribune did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) It’s highly misleading. The article cites a Dec. 1, 2016, blog post titled, ""Passing $1 Trillion,"" by the American Action Forum, a group that describes itself as ""center-right"" and ""free-market."" (Here’s some background on the group from our friends at FactCheck.org.) As a free-market group, reducing the regulatory burden is a core principle. So for years, the group has been tallying the costs of federal regulations, basing its work on the federal government’s own estimates of a regulation’s impact on both direct and indirect costs, including higher consumer prices, lower wages, and costs related to paperwork and other overhead. Late this year, the tally passed $1 trillion, which prompted the blog post in question. The $3,000 figure stems from the group’s calculation of $1 trillion in costs being spread out among the entire population. ""On a per capita basis, there are 324 million people in the U.S., equating to a regulatory burden of $3,080 per person,"" wrote Sam Batkins, the group’s director of regulatory policy. So the $3,000 figure is based on a nugget of truth. But the Conservative Tribune, and other websites that shared similar headlines, framed the finding in a way that is significantly misleading. Here are five problems in the description. The $3,000-a-person figure For starters, some of the $1 trillion figure that this is based on stems from regulations imposed before Obama took office. The $1 trillion figure ""tracked all net present value regulatory costs since 2005, so it includes the entire second half of the Bush administration,"" Batkins told PolitiFact. By our calculation, final rules under Obama alone accounted for $865 billion. That would produce a figure of $2,670 rather than $3,000. Not a dramatic difference, but one worth pointing out. And the annual cost of Obama’s regulations -- rather than the cumulative cost -- is a bit over $500 a person, according to the group’s calculations. That’s still substantial, but it’s not the wallop that $3,000 would be. The assertion that Obama did this ""right before leaving"" That’s not the case. This regulatory cost burden has been accumulating in fits and starts since more than a decade ago in 2005. In fact, the figure also includes regulatory costs that either ""have been or will be imposed during the next few years,"" the blog post said. That means that ""some of the costs might not be borne until the next decade,"" Batkins told PolitiFact. This would not hit ""every"" American, or all at once The headline phrase ""take $3,000 from every U.S. citizen"" makes it sound like people's taxes are going up $3,000 in one fell swoop. They are not. Rather, this amount would be drained over a long period of time and in myriad ways, with some people getting a bigger hit (by losing a job) and some a smaller hit (by having to pay a little more for products they buy). ""It’s correct to say that regulations don’t act like taxes,"" Batkins said. ""Many of the cost estimates take the form of higher prices for some consumer products, cars, air conditioners, and furnaces."" This is an estimate, and it was calculated by a group with a perspective The headline does not make clear that these figures are estimates. The American Action Forum’s own post notes, ""There is probably no one ‘correct answer’ on the cumulative costs of regulation. These figures are just estimates (unadjusted for inflation) from federal regulators, some more than a decade old, which might have dubious value."" And as we’ve noted, the American Action Fund has a free-market orientation. Other groups with different perspectives may frame the statistics accordingly. This calculation leaves out all benefits from these regulations The American Action Forum mentions in its blog post that the government also calculates benefits that spring from these regulatory costs. ""There are also benefits associated with many, but not all, of the largest regulations,"" Batkins told PolitiFact. All told, the group’s blog post says, ""AAF recorded $745 billion in annual benefits during the same period."" Benefits from regulations implemented under Obama include prevention of foodborne illnesses through inspection, consumer protection in the financial sector, flammability standards for consumer products, reduced energy use from conservation standards, cleaner air from emissions standards, air cargo security standards, oil-well blowout preventer systems and nuclear reactor safety standards, among many others. So, using both the cost and benefit figures, the net cost of regulations would work out to less than $800 a person -- still a net cost, but much smaller than the $3,000 figure cited in the headline. Ultimately, for the headline to cite just the costs but not the benefits amounts to cherry picking. Our ruling The Conservative Tribune published a post titled, ""Before Leaving, Obama Enacts Rules to Take $3,000 From EVERY American,"" and other websites offered posts with similar headlines. The figure is based on a calculation from an anti-regulatory group, though we do give the conclusion some credence because the number is drawn from the federal government’s own estimates. However, the headline glosses over several important caveats. The costs were not solely imposed under Obama, and the ones that were on his watch occurred over an eight-year period, rather than just ""before leaving"" the White House. Finally, contrary to the headline’s implication, Americans will not be charged a $3,000 fee because of action taken in Obama’s final weeks. Rather, they would experience higher consumer costs or lower wages over many years, with a lot of variation from person to person, and going many years into the future. The calculation completely ignores the estimated benefits of these regulations, with a value that balances out about three-quarters of the cost figure cited. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/dec/14/conservative-tribune/conservative-website-exaggerates-misleads-post-reg/
"['Health Care', 'Wisconsin', 'Ron Johnson']","
Testing Ron Johnson claim that under Obamacare, “premiums have doubled and tripled” in Wisconsin
","President Barack Obama’s health insurance overhaul was a popular target during the 2016 campaign, as Republicans made the case change was needed and vowed to repeal it. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, was among those taking aim at Obamacare. With Republicans poised to implement changes after presidential and Congressional victories, it seemed a good time to revisit one of Johnson’s claims. In an October debate, Johnson wrapped up a six-minute answer to an Obamacare question by asserting ""premiums have doubled and tripled"" in Wisconsin since the law was implemented. Did health insurance costs spike in Wisconsin after the Affordable Care Act? Let’s look at the numbers. Johnson cites, expands on study The debate question Johnson was responding to asked what he would do to reduce insurance costs, while noting rates on the federal health insurance exchange were poised to increase by about 16 percent in 2017. So it’s fair to assume his answer refers to that exchange, also called the individual market. Those are independent, non-group plans not run through employers or government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. Johnson began by citing a study by the conservative Manhattan Institute, and the ""doubled and tripled"" statement referred back to that study. The study, which looked only at the individual market, calculated the average premium in 2013 and 2014 (before and after the individual mandate took effect) by averaging the five least expensive plans in each county nationwide. The institute published a before and after premium for males and females ages 27, 40 and 64. Johnson then extended the study to 2017 by adding the average rate increase in Wisconsin for 2015, 2016 and 2017, as calculated by the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance. That office listed increases of 3.8 percent in 2015, 8.4 percent in 2016 and 15.9 percent in 2017. The rate increase across the age and gender groups then ranged from an increase of 180 percent to 310 percent. Johnson cited those numbers at the debate, though he wrongly attributed them only to the Manhattan Institute. Yevgeniy Feyman, adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute and an author of the study, said Johnson’s methodology for extending the time period made sense. To make sure, PolitiFact Wisconsin used a methodology similar to Feyman’s to average the five lowest-cost plans available in each Wisconsin county from 2015-’17. That yielded increases similar to Johnson’s calculations and consistent with the claim that premiums doubled and tripled. ""For all consumers, it’s clear rates increased in the first year and for some more than doubled,"" Elizabeth Hizmi, spokesman for the state insurance office, said in an email. ""In most cases, rates significantly increased when you add in the compounding of rate increases."" Hizmi said the agency didn’t do its own calculation of rates before and after Obamacare because before 2014 each insurer developed rates using different methodologies and filed their rate changes at different times. Loren Adler, associate director of the Center for Health Policy at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said the Affordable Care Act did indeed have a significant impact in Wisconsin, which had the highest rate increase of any state in the individual marketplace. Claim applies to narrow band of people We’ll pause to note, however, that those increases apply to a relatively small group of Wisconsinites. Only 6 percent of state residents get non-group insurance such as the individual market, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Employer-sponsored insurance is the most common in Wisconsin — at 55 percent of the population — and those trends are very different from the ones Johnson cited. From 2014 to 2016, premiums for individual coverage in employer-sponsored plans rose by an average of 3 percent per year nationally, according to Kaiser. That’s a slower increase than the average of 5.2 percent per year in the three years before ACA took effect. That slowdown in rate increases also has to be put in context, though, since it is due in part to employees choosing higher-deductible plans, Kaiser notes. Study methodology questioned Adler also took issue with part of the Manhattan Institute’s methodology. The study simplified the final comparison by combining the pre-ACA rates paid by healthy people and the higher rates paid by those previously denied coverage, weighting the rates based on the percentage previously denied and how much more they typically paid. The result was a more straightforward conclusion but one that didn’t really reflect either of the two groups. Healthy people in the individual marketplace saw premiums grow by even more than the amount cited in the study, but sicker people likely saw premiums drop, or were able to get coverage when they previously couldn’t, Adler said. And that less-than-healthy group is not small: A 2009 study by the American Health Insurance Plans Center for Policy and Research said 34 percent of all policyholders were offered insurance at higher than standard rates. The Manhattan Institute study also did not factor in the subsidies that many people receive to offset the higher premiums in the individual market. PolitiFact National noted this in a 2013 fact check addressing a claim by Fox News host Sean Hannity based on the Manhattan Institute study. But both the study and Johnson were clearly referencing premiums, not out-of-pocket costs. Our rating Johnson said premiums have doubled and tripled in Wisconsin after Obamacare. That was based on extrapolating a study that looked only at 2014, but the study author said Johnson’s approach was methodologically sound. And an analysis by PolitiFact Wisconsin found similar numbers. Those increases are only true for the 6 percent of Wisconsinites buying insurance on the individual market, but that was the group specifically identified in the debate question to which Johnson was responding. And while the study did not differentiate on the health of policyholders, it did provide a general range for how premiums changed after the Affordable Care Act. We rate Johnson’s statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8000c04-45f8-4d6e-9c91-5c00e6a46cba",/factchecks/2016/dec/13/ron-johnson/testing-ron-johnson-claim-under-obamacare-premiums/

Facebook image revives made-up claim Nancy Pelosi praised employers cutting hours
","Just days after winning another term as House Democratic leader, U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California was the target of a viral image that deliberately — and falsely — made it appear she said losing work shifts was a good thing for Americans. Conservative group Turning Point USA attacked Pelosi in a Dec. 8, 2016, Facebook post that showed her face next to a quote that read, ""Employers cutting hours is a good thing. It then gives that person time to pursue their dreams and passions."" No context is given for when or why Pelosi may have said that, and we can’t find any evidence she ever did. But the post was shared widely on social media nonetheless, including a popular thread on Reddit.   It appears that the image is a misquote from a Sept. 22, 2013, State of the Union interview Pelosi gave to Candy Crowley on CNN. Not only did Pelosi not use the words being attributed to her, but the entire context of the conversation is lost. Crowley was asking Pelosi whether she had any reservations about the federal insurance exchange that was about to open for customers for the first time. HealthCare.gov was slated to debut Oct. 1, 2013. Some people worried that employers would limit shifts for many hourly workers in order to meet the Affordable Care Act requirement that employees who worked more than 30 hours had to have insurance coverage. (For the record, there’s a bit of evidence that some companies did cut hours after the advent of Obamacare, but it’s difficult to pinpoint why.) Here’s the transcript of that portion of the interview, with video posted here: CROWLEY: ""Let me ask you then about Obamacare, itself. Coming up for a big date on Obamacare, October 1, when people can begin to sign up through the marketplaces. Do you have any reservations at all? Are you worried at all? And I ask you this because you know union leaders, I mean, James Hoffa is one of those who wrote a letter to you and said Obamacare as it now stands would, quote, ‘destroy the foundation of the 40-hour work week.’ That's pretty tough from a loyal Democratic constituency."" PELOSI: ""Well, we're working on the issue that relates to all of these multiemployer plans, which unions are one and some are charities."" CROWLEY: ""Bargaining rights or otherwise risks. There's more than one employer involved in a contract."" PELOSI: ""More than one employer involved in a contract. And that has to be certainly clarified. There's just so much the president can do within the law. But there is some leeway to facilitate as we are in the Congress under the exchanges. So, I'm optimistic, because, we will find a path. But overwhelmingly for the American people, this is a liberation. This is life, healthy life, liberty, the freedom to pursue your happiness, which could be, follow your passion for good rather than follow your palate and be constrained by your policy.

What she did say was that the launch of HealthCare.gov was a good thing for Americans, because they would no longer have to stay in a certain job just to keep their insurance coverage. It’s a talking point Pelosi had used before, and was attacked over before. It also was misrepresented the same way in 2013. Pelosi spokeswoman Caroline Behringer confirmed that the House minority leader did not say the words attributed to her. ""It is something we saw spread on the internet, but has no basis in reality,"" Behringer said. Our ruling A viral image quoted Pelosi as saying, ""Employers cutting hours is a good thing. It then gives that person time to pursue their dreams and passions."" This attack first came up in 2013, right before the federal insurance exchange opened. It looks to be a misquote based on a CNN interview, in which Pelosi was asked about employers potentially cutting workers’ hours to avoid having to buy them health insurance. Pelosi responded that Obamacare still ""liberated"" Americans, because workers had an option for affordable insurance beyond having to stay with an employer for the coverage. Those people would then be free to find a job they liked better and still be covered, she said. The image not only puts words in her mouth, it deliberately twists the meaning of what she really said.

Donald Trump's Electoral College victory was not a 'massive landslide'
","Donald Trump won enough electoral votes on Election Day to become president. But he and his staff have been trying to make clear that they didn’t just win — they say they steamrolled Hillary Clinton. ""We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College,"" Trump told Chris Wallace on the Dec. 11 edition of Fox News Sunday. That echoed earlier comments by the Trump transition team and a tweet by campaign manager Kellyanne Conway (""306. Landslide. Blowout. Historic""). We previously rated False the statement by Reince Priebus, Trump’s soon-to-be White House chief of staff, that Trump’s victory was ""an electoral landslide."" So what about Trump’s own assertion that ""we had a massive landslide victory ... in the Electoral College""? (Trump’s transition office did not respond to an inquiry.) The claim remains well short on evidence Here is a chart showing the percentage of electoral votes won by every presidential winner since George Washington (who was the only president to win every single electoral vote). It’s drawn from research by John J. Pitney Jr., a Claremont McKenna College political scientist. Trump’s victory is marked in red. He won 56.88 percent of the available electoral votes. This chart makes it clear that Trump’s percentage doesn’t rank near the top. In fact, it ranks near the bottom, belonging somewhere between the lowest one-fourth and the lowest one-fifth of all Electoral College victories in history. ""If your share of the electoral vote ranks behind Martin Van Buren's, then you did not win in a landslide,"" Pitney told PolitiFact. If you think that comparing elections 200-plus years ago to today is problematic, the math also shows that Trump’s share of the Electoral College vote is low by recent standards. Since the end of World War II, Trump’s percentage of the Electoral College vote is lower than 12 previous results (1948, 1952, 1956, 1964, 1972, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2008 and 2012). By contrast, Trump’s electoral vote haul was bigger than only five elections in the post-World War II era (1960, 1968, 1976, 2000 and 2004). So Trump ranks in the bottom one-third by this metric. ""If Trump’s election was a landslide, then the word ‘landslide’ has no meaning,"" said University of Denver political scientist Seth Masket. The popular-vote discrepancy in favor of Hillary Clinton further dampens Trump’s claim. As of Dec. 12, with a dwindling number of votes remaining to be counted, Clinton is winning the popular vote by 2.84 million votes, or 2.1 percentage points. While there have been four previous occasions when a presidential candidate lost the Electoral College vote while winning the popular vote, Clinton’s margin of victory is notably large. Measured by raw votes, Clinton’s margin is currently more than five times bigger than Al Gore’s 2000 popular vote victory. Losing the popular vote ""takes the shine off any Electoral College victory,"" political scientist Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Pitney of Claremont McKenna said he’s mystified about why the Trump camp is trying to make such a weak argument in the place of ones that would hold more water. ""If they had just described the outcome as a ‘dramatic upset victory,’ nobody could reasonably disagree,"" Pitney said. Our ruling Trump said, ""We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College."" Trump won, but to call it a ""massive landslide"" in the Electoral College is not accurate by any reasonable definition. While Trump surpassed the required 270 electoral votes with room to spare, his margin ranks no better than the bottom quarter of Electoral College showings in American history, and no better than the bottom one-third of the showings since the end of World War II. Trump’s claim is inaccurate, so we rate it False.",/factchecks/2016/dec/12/donald-trump/donald-trumps-electoral-college-victory-was-not-ma/

Rick Scott says federal government has shortchanged Florida on Zika money
","Florida Gov. Rick Scott hopes that his ally headed to the White House, President-elect Donald Trump, will speed up funding for Florida to combat the Zika virus. While announcing that state health officials had lifted the zone of active Zika transmission in one area of Miami-Dade County, Scott mentioned his ongoing feud with President Barack Obama’s administration about the pace and size of federal dollars flowing to Florida. ""It has been more than two months since over $1 billion in Zika funding was signed by President Obama, and the federal government has still only committed $7 million to help reimburse Florida’s costs of fighting this virus,"" Scott wrote in a Dec. 2 press statement. (A week later, Scott announced that the last Zika zone -- in South Beach -- had been lifted.) We found that Scott isn’t telling the full story. Scott’s statement about only $7 million heading to Florida makes no mention of the millions of other federal dollars the state has had access to since the summer to combat Zika. Federal Zika funding Obama proposed $1.9 billion in Zika funding in February but that led to a partisan battle, and Congress didn’t reach an agreement until September. Obama signed a spending bill that included $1.1 billion to combat Zika later that month. States like Florida were expected to get significant chunks of the money to pay for increased mosquito control, faster diagnostic tests and other expenses. (Florida had 1,236 Zika cases, the majority of which came from outside the continental United States, as of Dec. 7.) The bill also included money for federal research. Florida applied for $15 million and received notice Oct. 28 that the funding had been approved through the federal epidemiology and laboratory capacity grant. However, the notice stated that for now $7.5 million was available to Florida and that the remainder was subject to the availability of funds. Mara Gambineri, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Health, said the state wasn’t certain if it came from the $1.1 billion program since it was part of an existing grant program. ""We have not been told what our distribution of funds as part of the $1.1 billion will be, nor have we been provided a timeline."" she said. Kevin Griffis, a spokesman for the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, told PolitiFact that the money is in fact part of the legislation Obama signed. The federal government provided half of the request to Florida while continuing to evaluate the state’s application, Griffis said. None of Florida’s request has been rejected, he said. The federal government expects to award most of the money for states by the end of December. Since Obama signed the legislation for the $1.1 billion, Florida has applied for about $92 million in grants. Scott’s statement centered on the specific $1.1 billion pot signed by Obama. Left unsaid was what happened over the summer, when the federal government offered Florida a shot at millions more dollars for its Zika fight. In total, the federal government had provided $16.5 million in Zika money to Florida by the date that Scott made his statement. That includes the $9 million that first came available this summer from a variety of grants and then the $7.5 million this fall (from the $1.1 billion legislation). On Dec. 12, Florida received notice that it will get $4.9 million more from the federal government to combat Zika. Florida could also claim reimbursements -- up to $29 million -- from federal public health emergency funds but has only drawn down some of those dollars. Florida officials have been reluctant to tap that money because they argue they could need it to respond to other health care threats such as those stemming from hurricanes or terrorism. In addition to the money, the CDC has provided personnel and materials to conduct tests, but Scott said he needs more prevention kits. Steve Ellis, vice president for Taxpayers for Common Sense, said that the federal government has to balance states’ desires for speed with concerns about avoiding waste or fraud. The federal government needs to be able to account for every allocated dollar. ""Federal money flows slower than a lot of people realize whether it’s a disaster or this event,"" he said. Our ruling Scott said President Obama signed a bill for more than $1 billion in Zika funding more than two months ago, ""and the federal government has still only committed $7 million,"" to help Florida. Obama signed a bill that included $1.1 billion in Zika funding Sept. 29. About a month later, federal officials told Florida that it would get $7.5 million for now. But Scott omits that the state previously had access to millions of additional dollars earmarked to combat Zika -- about $9 million, as of the date of Scott’s statement. Also, the state can access other public health dollars. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/dec/12/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-federal-government-has-shortchange/

Gingrich correct: Life expectancy initially fell short of Social Security eligibility age
","Social Security today is not the program President Franklin D. Roosevelt had in mind when he signed it into law in 1935, according to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. ""We adopted the modern Social Security system at a time when the average person died before they were old enough to get Social Security,"" he said during a Dec. 2 interview on ""The John Fredericks Show,"" broadcast in Virginia. ""We now have some people who are living 50 years on Social Security,"" Gingrich said. ""Nobody ever tried to design a system like this, and we’re going to have to rethink our whole approach."" We wondered if Gingrich was right about life expectancy falling short of Social Security age in 1935. The bill signed by Roosevelt offered benefits to retirees when they turned 65. U.S. life expectancy for a person born in 1935 was just under 62 years, according to records from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On average, girls were expected to live to 64 and boys to 60. We were curious whether the retirement age was set purposely at 65 to deprive most people of receiving Social Security. Did Roosevelt make this calculation? ""Certainly the Roosevelt administration did not,"" said Edward Berkowitz, a professor of public policy at George Washington University and author of several books on Social Security. ""My understanding, that I received from longtime Social Security actuary Robert Myers, was that the age 65 had no particular significance and was chosen because a choice needed to be made and (it) seemed reasonable."" Myers, who died in 2010, helped to write the Social Security law and in a 1992 memoir offered a simple explanation for how the Roosevelt administration chose the qualifying age for benefits. ""Age 65 was picked because 60 was too young and 70 was too old,"" he wrote. ""So we split the difference."" Berkowitz told us that life expectancy at birth - then and now - ""is not a good measure of how many people who are working and paying into Social Security will die before age 65."" That’s because the life expectancy average is skewed by infant deaths. After infancy is survived, life expectancy goes up. That said, we’ll give you one final set of numbers. Average U.S. life expectancy from birth in 2015 was 78.8 years, according to figures just released by the National Center for Health Statistics. It declined from 78.9 in 2014 - the first drop since 1993. Average life expectancy for men last year was 76.3 years; for women, 81.2.

Reince Priebus falsely claims no conclusive report whether Russia tried to influence election
","Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee and President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming chief of staff, tried in an interview on Meet the Press to dismiss news reports that the CIA believes Russia aimed to boost Trump’s election chances. Priebus questioned the credibility of the reports, first published on Dec. 9, 2016, because they relied on unnamed sources and because he says they wrongly claimed that the RNC’s computer system also was hacked. He also tried to cast doubt on the generally accepted idea that it was was the Russians who were behind the hacking. ""Let's clear this up. Do you believe -- does the president-elect believe that Russia was trying to muddy up and get involved in the election in 2016?"" Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked on Dec. 11, 2016. ""No. 1, you don't know it. I don't know it,"" Priebus said. ""There's been no conclusive or specific report to say otherwise."" That’s wrong. There is a specific report. It was made public on Oct. 7, 2016, in the form of a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. At the time, the website WikiLeaks was releasing a steady flow of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and top Hillary Clinton adviser John Podesta. ""The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations,"" the statement said. ""These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process."" Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin political scientist who focuses on Russia, called that letter, ""a pretty strong statement."" Herrera said Priebus’ comment represents a ""disturbing"" denial of facts. ""There has been a specific report, and politicians who wish to comment on the issue should read and comment on that report rather than suggest there is no such report or that no work has been done on the topic,"" Herrera said. Neither Priebus’ office nor the Trump transition team replied to a request for comment. In the Meet the Press interview, Priebus attacked the most recent news reports that the Russian government was interfering with the election to benefit Trump. In particular, Priebus objected to reporting from the New York Times claiming that the CIA believes Russia hacked into the Republican National Committee’s computer system but chose not to release any of that material. However, to bolster that point, he blew past the October findings, not once but twice in the course of the interview. Much does remain uncertain. We happened to catch Herrera while she was meeting with another analyst of Russian politics, University of Chicago economist Konstantin Sonin. The two of them painted a more tangled picture of how the Russians might have been involved. ""There are lots of quasi-institutional channels of people who are doing work in one way or another for the government who then do other things, informally, without being asked explicitly,"" they said. They think it’s unlikely that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the hacking. But at this point, that’s just one theory.

In fact, in early October, the director of national intelligence, representing 17 intelligence agencies, and the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security said they were confident that the Russian government had directed the email hacks of the Democratic National Committee and a top Clinton adviser.

In the Wisconsin presidential election recount, is only Dane County doing the recount by hand?
","A Twitter war (well, skirmish) broke out between two Wisconsin congressmen after one of them, Republican Sean Duffy, called Madison a Communist community. In making the attack, Duffy also made a claim about the state’s recount of 2016 election results, which was forced by Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein and supported by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. ""We only have one county that's hand counting the votes, that's Dane County, which is the home of Madison,"" Duffy told Fox News talk show host Tucker Carlson on Dec. 1, 2016. ""It's the progressive-liberal-Communist community of Madison. ""And they’re taking as long as they can -- the Stein and Hillary folks who are on the ground are taking as much time contesting ballots, slow walking as much as they can."" Six days later, Democrat Mark Pocan, a decades-long resident of the Madison area, tweeted: Demanding an apology from @RepSeanDuffy for calling Madison communist community that doesn't believe in democracy & freedom on @FoxNews. That led Duffy to respond the same day with his own tweet: The PC crowd is humorless. For those offended by my ""communist"" comment, I'll send a therapy dog to your ""safe place"" of choice in Madison. And the next day, Pocan went on Carlson’s show to talk about the spat some more. Perhaps lost in the back-and-forth was Duffy’s claim about the recount -- that Dane is the only county in Wisconsin recounting ballots by hand. The recount Stein raised millions of dollars over the Thanksgiving holiday to pay for presidential election recounts in Wisconsin and two other states. She also said Wisconsin uses illegal voting machines, which we rated Pants on Fire. We noted in that item that the vast majority of voting machines in Wisconsin are optical readers. Voters fill out a paper ballot and feed it into the machine, which then electronically records the vote. Meanwhile, a small percentage of votes are cast on touch-screen machines -- but in Wisconsin they also generate a paper record for each ballot cast. As of early afternoon on Dec. 9, 2016, with the recount expected to be completed within two or three days, 88.5 percent of the Wisconsin votes had been recounted. Clinton had gained 49 votes on Republican Donald Trump, who won the state by some 22,000 votes in the original count. All told, there was a net change of 1,322 votes in the presidential race among the more than 2.63 million ballots that had been recounted. As for how the recounting has been done, the majority of Wisconsin’s 72 counties (including Dane, but not Milwaukee) are doing it by hand. Here is what the county election clerks told the Wisconsin Election Commission at the outset of the recount about their plans for the recount: 47 counties: Recount by hand
13 counties: Combination of hand count and optical scanners
12 counties: Optical scanners A word on the process in Wisconsin: The commission told us it did not follow up with the clerks to see if any of their plans had changed. But there were news reports about hand counts being done in various counties, including Brown, Clark and Marinette. In any case, Duffy was not claiming that Dane was the only county doing hand recounts, according to Duffy spokesman Mark Bednar. Duffy ""was explaining that Dane County was the only county where there were reports on the ground of Stein supporters trying to slow-walk the recount process,"" Bednar said. But that’s not how it came out in the interview. Duffy declared that only Dane County was hand counting votes. But many counties decided to do the recount by hand. The ""slow walking"" part of what Duffy said has to do with Stein and Clinton supporters and nothing to do with Dane County.

Uber cherry picks data from study about drunken driving
","More than 43,000 people in upstate New York opened the app for the Uber ride-sharing service the night before Thanksgiving. Their attempts to catch a ride failed. New York State does not allow the ride-hailing service north of New York City. Uber hopes to persuade state lawmakers to change that during next year’s legislative session. It has collected more than 100,000 signatures on an online petition asking lawmakers to allow the service upstate. ""Uber can also make New York a safer place to live by reducing drunk driving throughout the State,"" the petition reads. ""A recent, independent study conducted by Temple University found that cities where Uber operates have 3.6%-5.6% fewer drunk driving deaths than cities without access to ridesharing."" The company repeated that claim in a press release last month. So is Uber right? Does ride-sharing reduce drunken-driving deaths?  What Temple University found Since Uber’s launch in 2010, the service has expanded from San Francisco to more than 100 U.S. cities. Temple University released its study in early 2015, and by then the ride-hailing service had already expanded to New York City and several other U.S. cities. The study attempted to find whether the Uber service changed the rate of drunken driving deaths. Uber got half of the study’s findings correct. Researchers Brad Greenwood and Sunil Wattal found a 3.6 percent to 5.6 percent reduction in drunken driving deaths in cities where Uber was introduced between 2009 and 2014. But the study looked at only cities in California. The study did not include comparable data from the other cities where Uber operated in the same time period. Greenwood says he’s working on an analysis for all of the cities, but the conclusion of that study won’t come soon. National studies A pair of researchers from Providence College and Stonehill College released a similar study earlier this year with a national perspective. Sean Mulholland and Angela Dills looked at 150 cities and counties where Uber operated between 2010 and 2013. They found a 6 percent decline in fatal crashes in cities after Uber becomes available. But they concluded the effect on drunken-driving deaths is insignificant. ""When we look specifically at fatal crashes where alcohol is involved we find a negative relationship, but the estimated coefficient is not statistically significant,"" Mulholland said. ""Therefore we are unable to say whether there is an increase or decrease in alcohol-related fatal crashes when Uber enters a location."" Mulholland said they found a 9 percent to 18 percent decrease in drunken-driving arrests in Uber locations. Another study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology from researchers at the University of Oxford and the University of Southern California, also found no effect on drunken driving deaths after Uber became available in 100 metropolitan areas in the United States. ""Findings reveal that the deployment of Uber services in a given metropolitan
county has no association with the number of subsequent traffic fatalities,"" the study found. Our ruling Uber claims a Temple University study ""found that cities where Uber operates have 3.6%-5.6% fewer drunk driving deaths than cities without access to ridesharing."" But the study looked only at California cities. Two national studies found the service had no effect on drunken-driving deaths.

Congressional Republican group claims Joe Biden said Jon Corzine is “the smartest guy that I know, in terms of the economy and on finance”
","
President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden campaigned for their fellow Democrat Jon Corzine as he fought in 2009 for re-election as New Jersey’s governor.

They may now be regretting that choice.

Corzine, the chairman and CEO of MF Global when it collapsed this fall, has been compelled to testify in front of several Congressional panels about the up to $1.2 billion in client money that disappeared during the firm’s bankruptcy. Using audio from Corzine’s testimony earlier this month and other video clips, the National Republican Congressional Committee released a web ad that ties Corzine, a former senator and governor of New Jersey, to the Obama administration.

In the ad posted to YouTube on Dec. 15,  Biden says of Corzine, ""he's the smartest guy that I know in terms of the economy and on finance, I really mean this."" As Biden makes the comment, a headline in the corner of the video reads: ""MF Global Proves Enron-Era Accounting Lives On,"" linking MF Global to the Texas-based energy company that went bankrupt and became a symbol of corporate fraud.

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Biden made the comment during a May 2009 appearance with Corzine in Lodi to tout a project funded by the federal stimulus act, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

The ad shows only a short segment of Biden’s speech, but we found two videos on YouTube with Biden’s longer comments -- one of which was posted by an account for Corzine.

""Look, the governor just laid out for you the overlap that exists in terms of the things your state is doing and leading on, on energy conservation, on wind and solar, what your state is doing on building schools and investing in education, what your state is doing on health care. And it's not coincidental that that's what the Recovery Act is,"" Biden said.  

""It's not coincidental that the things he did here turned out to be the exact same things the Recovery Act has, because way back in the transition period, before we were sworn in, when Barack Obama and I were literally sitting in a desk in a high rise in Chicago beginning to plan how we would try to get this economy out of a ditch. Literally, the first guy I called was Jon Corzine. Not a joke. Not a joke. Because first of all, he's the smartest guy that I know in terms of the economy and on finance, I really mean this.""

So Biden praised Corzine’s financial prowess then, but is it fair to tie those past comments to what’s happening now?

Michele Claibourn, a research associate at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, and Tobe Berkovitz, an associate professor of advertising at Boston University who also works as a political media consultant for campaigns, said yes.

Claibourn said in an email that ""prior praise of Corzine strikes me as relevant insofar as Biden’s/Obama’s praise calls into question the judgment of the administration.""

Berkovitz said Corzine ""had a reputation in terms of being fiscally brilliant and all that and so to say well things have changed now, this is a man who received the accolades of the president, of the vice president and they now should be held accountable for the opinions of the man.""

""You can’t say, ‘well I’d like to take that back,’"" he said.

Our ruling

The National Republican Congressional Committee released an ad that links Corzine to the Obama administration. In it,  Biden says, ""he’s the smartest guy that I know, in terms of the economy and on finance, I really mean this.""

Biden made the comment about Corzine before MF Global collapsed and customer funds disappeared, but they’re still the vice president’s words.

Newt Gingrich says no federal official is allowed to say ""Merry Christmas""
","Newt Gingrich says the nation's obsession with being politically correct has come to this: Federal officials aren't allowed to say ""Merry Christmas.""

On the campaign trail, Gingrich has offered strong criticism of efforts to keep religion out of public places and said he would hold judges to account if they rule in favor of stricter separation between church and state. The topic came up in Davenport, Iowa, on Dec. 19, 2011. The question wasn’t audible on a video clip, but here's Gingrich's reply:

""This is actually weird . . . I’ve been investigating this for the last three days. I am told that this is actually a 20- or 30-year-old law, which I have to say I find strange, and I would advocate repealing the law. Apparently if the president sends out Christmas cards, they are paid for the Democratic or Republican National Committees because no federal official at any level is currently allowed to say ‘Merry Christmas.’ And the idea, I think, is that the government should be neutral. … I'm going to go back and find out how was this law written, when was it passed. We’ve had this whole — in my mind — very destructive attitude in the last 50 years that we have to drive religion out of public life.""

A reader brought this to our attention, so we decided to look into whether Gingrich is right that ""no federal official at any level is currently allowed to say ‘Merry Christmas.’""

First off, we’ll grant a little leeway in Gingrich’s wording. The United States government does not, as a general matter, monitor and control employees' private conversations, so we’ll assume that Gingrich isn't suggesting that if a federal bureaucrat is in the comfort of their home, they can't wish a neighbor ""Merry Christmas.""

But what about in the workplace? If a federal worker wishes to say that to a colleague, do they get reprimanded?

To explore this, we examined federal rules, spoke with labor unions that represent government workers and interviewed lawyers with expertise in federal rules. The upshot: It's perfectly acceptable to say ""Merry Christmas!"" (Or ""Happy Hanukkah!"")

We started with ""Memorandum on Religious Exercise and Religious Expression in the Federal Workplace,"" issued Aug. 14, 1997, by President Bill Clinton. We found the rule was respectful of employees' rights to express their religious preference:

""First, agencies shall permit employees to engage in personal religious expression (as they must permit other constitutionally valued expression) to the greatest extent possible, consistent with interests in workplace efficiency and requirements of law. Of course, the workplace is for work, and an agency may restrict any speech that truly interferes with its ability to perform public services. In addition, an agency may have a legal obligation to restrict certain forms of speech that intrude unduly on the legitimate rights of others. But when an agency allows nonreligious speech, because that speech does not impinge on these interests, an agency also usually must allow otherwise similar speech of a religious nature. The one exception to this principle of neutrality—an exception mandated by the Establishment Clause—is when religious speech would lead a reasonable observer to conclude that the Government is endorsing religion. Subject to this exception, an agency may not typically subject religious speech to greater restrictions than other speech entitled to full constitutional protection, and therefore should allow much of this speech to go forward.""

While there is some gray area in that passage, there’s nothing as sweeping as Gingrich claims, said Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia who specializes in church-state issues.

Indeed, the more detailed rules affiliated with this memorandum suggest quite the opposite. Among the theoretical examples provided is this one: ""At Christmas time, a supervisor places a wreath over the entrance to the office's main reception area. This course of conduct is permitted.""

Laycock added that ""there is no such law anywhere in the United States Code. There is no such regulation of sufficient status to appear in the Code of Federal Regulations. I am certain of these two facts, because they are both computer-searchable. … It is hard to imagine a rule that applies to every ‘federal official at any level’ not appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.""

Richard W. Garnett, a University of Notre Dame law professor and another specialist in church-state issues, agreed. ""I’m not aware of any general prohibition on federal workers, in private or on the job, saying the words, 'Merry Christmas.' ""

We also checked with the American Federation of Government Employees, a labor union for federal workers. A spokeswoman said she checked with the union’s legal staff and they confirmed the view that federal workers are allowed to say ""Merry Christmas.""

John M. Palguta, vice president for policy at the Partnership for Public Service, a group that promotes careers in government, said the notion that ""any other federal official is prohibited by law from saying ‘Merry Christmas’ is absurd.""

So where did Gingrich’s falsehood come from? The Gingrich campaign hasn't been responding to our inquiries, but it appears to be rooted in two things -- the White House tradition of using political parties to pay for the White House Christmas card, and the rules for congressional postage.

On White House Christmas cards, Gingrich has a point. The White House has long avoided the use of taxpayer dollars to pay for the Christmas cards it sends out, said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University historian who has written about the issue. Instead, political party committees foot the bill.

But this appears to be a longstanding custom that began decades ago out of an abundance of caution, not because federal law bans the practice outright. The legal concerns that prompted the initial decision may have involved ""the separation of church and state, as well as concerns that the holiday cards would be viewed as political in nature, possibly implicating laws against the use of federal funds for campaign purposes,"" said Robert K. Kelner, a lawyer who specializes in political and election law at the firm Covington & Burling.

Joe Conn, a spokesman for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, said that ""in recent years, the White House cards have been generally nonsectarian in character, probably because candidates of both parties happily take contributions from donors of all faiths and none. And they don’t want to turn off any potential contributors.""

We checked transcripts of speeches by federal officials and quickly found plenty of examples of Christmas wishes:

• ""Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!"" -- President Barack Obama, Dec. 1, 2011

• ""Merry Christmas and happy holidays, everybody."" -- Obama, Dec. 13, 2010

• ""Merry Christmas to my constituents, as I’ve said, and Merry Christmas to our first family and all that they have done for America."" -- Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, Dec. 16, 2009

• ""Merry Christmas to everyone. I reserve the balance of my time."" -- U.S. Rep. Dean Heller, R-Nev., Dec. 16, 2009

Gingrich's more sweeping claim fits into the annual complaint by Fox News commentators and other conservatives that there is a ""war on Christmas."" This year, a column in the conservative Washington Examiner said the U.S. House of Representatives has banned ""wishing constituents a ‘Merry Christmas’ if they want to do so in a mailing paid for with tax dollars.""

Mark Tapscott, who edits the newspaper’s editorial page, wrote that ""Members who submit official mailings for review by the congressional franking commission that reviews all congressional mail to determine if it can be ‘franked,’ or paid for with tax dollars, are being told that no holiday greetings, including ‘Merry Christmas,’ can be sent in official mail.""

Tapscott quoted a Capitol Hill staffer who requested anonymity saying, ""I called the commission to ask for clarification and was told no 'Merry Christmas.' Also told cannot say 'Happy New Year' but can say 'have a happy new year' – referencing the time period of a new year, but not the holiday.""

The column goes on to cite a Dec. 12, 2011, memo from the ""Franking Commission Staff"" concerning ""Holiday Messaging.""

According to the column, the memo said that examples of ""nonfrankable items"" include ""birthday, anniversary, wedding, birth, retirement or condolence messages and holiday greetings. … You may make reference to the season as a whole using language along the lines of, 'Have a safe and happy holiday season.' It may only be incidental to the piece rather than the primary purpose of the communication."" (This rule was subsequently mocked by Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly here.)

We weren’t able to independently obtain the memo from the House Administration committee, nor speak to a spokesperson for the committee. But we did look up the House’s official franking rulebook at the committee’s website, and it closely follows the language of the memo obtained by the Examiner, saying that ""birthday, anniversary, wedding, birth, retirement or condolence messages and holiday greetings are prohibited.""

We also checked the Senate guidelines, which are broadly similar. The Senate ""prohibits the use of the frank for ‘any card expressing holiday greetings from (a Senator).’ This prohibition extends to acknowledgments of holiday greetings sent to a Senator, but does not preclude an expression of holiday greetings at the commencement or conclusion of otherwise frankable correspondence.""

So both the House and Senate -- whose employees are federal workers -- do restrict the use of taxpayer funds for sending out holiday cards, as well as birthday, anniversary, wedding, birth, retirement and condolence cards. So this is not a war on Christmas. It's more like a war on … greeting cards.

From that rule, it's a ridiculous leap to Gingrich’s claim that ""no federal official at any level is currently allowed to say ‘Merry Christmas.’""

Here’s the kicker: The House regulations that sparked Gingrich’s outrage are dated June 1998, when the House Speaker was … Newt Gingrich. And the present Republican speaker, John Boehner of Ohio, was on the committee that directly wrote the rules.

Our rating

While it’s true that the intersection of religion, the workplace, and the federal government is legally tricky due to issues surrounding the separation of church and state, it is ridiculously false to say that ""no federal official at any level is currently allowed to say ‘Merry Christmas.’"" Guidelines in force for the past 15 years give substantial freedom for personal religious expression in the federal workplace, and neither those guidelines nor federal law includes anything like an outright ban on a federal official saying, ""Merry Christmas.""

The closest Gingrich comes to accuracy is that Congress does bar taxpayer-funded official mailings of all types of cards. However, such rules affect only one class of federal employees (those who serve in Congress); the rules are only about postage (lawmakers are free to send cards on their own dime); and it certainly does not abridge the right of any Member of Congress or congressional employee to speak the words ""Merry Christmas.""

Attack ad says Newt Gingrich aligned with Dems on global warming
","With just two weeks until the Iowa caucuses, a new ad from a pro-Mitt Romney ""Super PAC"" is attacking Republican presidential front-runner Newt Gingrich over ""a ton of baggage"" from his past.

""Barack Obama’s plan is working: Destroy Mitt Romney, run against Newt Gingrich,"" a voice says as images of Gingrich flash on the screen, interspersed with damning headlines. ""Newt has a ton of baggage. He was fined $300,000 for ethics violations and took $1.6 million from Freddie Mac, before it helped cause the economic meltdown. Newt supports amnesty for illegal immigrants, and teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming. Maybe that’s why George Will calls him the least conservative candidate. Check the facts at NewtFacts.com.""

The ad, airing in December 2011 in Florida and Iowa, is paid for by a political action committee, which isn’t formally tied to any campaign but can spend money influencing elections. The one behind this ad is known as Restore our Future and is staffed and funded by many supporters of Mitt Romney.

It goes after the former House speaker on several issues. Here, we’re focusing on the claim that Gingrich ""teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming.""

The source

The ad cites the website Newtfacts.com, which lays out a list of -- you guessed it -- more claims and citations about Gingrich, including this one:

""Gingrich shot an ad with Nancy Pelosi in 2008 calling for action on global warming,"" followed by a link.

In that now-famous ad, Gingrich sits on a couch next to Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the House.

""We don’t always see eye to eye, do we, Newt?"" Pelosi says.

""No,"" Gingrich answers, ""but we do agree: Our country must take action to address climate change.""

Pelosi: ""We need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast.""

Gingrich: ""If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need.""

The ad then directs viewers to the website WeCanSolveIt.org, with the final words from Pelosi, ""Together, we can do this.""

About Al Gore

The ad was created by a Gore-founded organization called the Alliance for Climate Protection that aims to spread awareness and prompt action to address climate change. It’s now known as the Climate Reality Project.

WeCanSolveIt.org is the former name of the site now called ClimateRealityProject.org.

""It is guided by one simple truth: The climate crisis is real and we know how to solve it,"" the site says. The group claims 5 million members worldwide.

In an interview with the online news show The Young Turks in December 2011, Gore mentioned that he had asked Gingrich to do the ad with Pelosi and Gingrich agreed. It was part of a larger campaign featuring ""'unlikely pairs,' who disagree on many issues but appear together to help thwart climate change,"" according to a 2008 story in the San Francisco Chronicle.

What they’re saying now

Gingrich, now tied for the lead for the Republican nomination, has big regrets that he made the ad.

The Gingrich campaign directed us to a section of its website devoted to ""answering the attacks."" In the climate change section, Gingrich is quoted as telling Fox News’ Brett Baier that making the ad with Pelosi was ""probably the dumbest single thing I’ve ever done.""

It goes on to explain that Gingrich opposes cap and trade legislation (although PolitiFact has found he supported it in the past), and he favors increased domestic oil drilling.

In the online news interview, Gore lamented Gingrich’s change of heart.

""I appreciated him agreeing to my request that he do it and I don’t want to be ungracious now. I’m grateful that he did it, and I’m sorry that he’s changed his position,"" Gore said.

Our ruling

Restore Our Future’s ad says that Gingrich ""teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming.""

In 2008, Gingrich filmed an ad with Pelosi calling for action on global warming, and he did it for Gore’s nonprofit group. Gingrich might regret it now, but the baggage is still there.

Rep. Steve Southerland says over 2.4 million jobs have been lost since the stimulus
","
U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland's office recently sent direct mail to constituents with a multiple-choice survey, telling them: ""Make your voice heard in Washington.""

The mailer also offered a snapshot of the Panama City Republican's priorities: Create jobs. Lower taxes. Cut government spending.

In a note on the back, Southerland explained how those ideas fit together. He begins:

""Dear Neighbor,

The fact is, over 2.4 million jobs have been lost since the 'Stimulus' bill was signed into law in February of 2009.""

So, more government spending, fewer jobs.

One of those neighbors sent us the mailer, asking us to check the facts.

The message

Here's Southerland's whole message, under the headline ""Listening to you. Working for you.""
  
The fact is, over 2.4 million jobs have been lost since the ""Stimulus"" bill was signed into law in February of 2009. Over 15,800 construction, manufacturing, and retail jobs were lost during August 2011 and overall our country continues to face a 9.1 percent unemployment rate. Higher taxes, record spending, and bigger government have failed to create jobs or boost economic growth.  
As Congress debates the next steps we must take toward job creation and economic growth, I invite you to fill out the attached questionnaire. Your concerns are of utmost importance to me, and your feedback and suggestions will be the driving force behind my work as your Representative in Congress. 

Sincerely, 

Rep. Steve Southerland  
The jobs 
The 2.4 million jobs lost figure Southerland cited comes from employment data kept by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Southerland calculated the net change in jobs between February 2009 and August 2011. (We should note that the bureau did revise its estimate down to 2.3 million from 2.4 million.) 
Also of note: If Southerland included jobs numbers through October 2011 -- which he could have done and still got his mailer out on time -- the net jobs figure would be different. 
Measuring from February 2009 to October 2011, the net reduction is 1.98 million jobs. 
That's 18 percent fewer jobs lost since February 2009 than the August number Southerland's mailer used. Still, it's right in thrust — the country has around 2 million fewer jobs since February two years ago. And Southerland's full statement did include a reference to ""August 2011,"" which provides readers additional context.

The stimulus

If the statement had been, ""The fact is, over 2.4 million jobs have been lost since February of 2009,"" we would be done. Southerland used mainstream stats correctly, even if they were a few months old.

But it also included this phrase: ""since the 'Stimulus' bill was signed into law."" 
At PolitiFact, when we evaluate statistical claims, we also examine the underlying point. Often, the claim implies blame. 
The claims have two parts: Were the numbers right? And: Was the politician to blame?

Southerland's claim implies the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 didn't help job creation. Later, he explains: ""Higher taxes, record spending, and bigger government have failed to create jobs or boost economic growth.""

What does the evidence say?

The most recent report from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, released in July, estimates the Recovery Act ""raised employment by 2.4 to 3.6 million jobs relative to what it otherwise would have been."" Don't trust White House advisers to evaluate the president's policies? It's not just their handiwork. The March report cited four independent analyses by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and three by private economic analysis companies, IHS/Global Insight, Macroeconomic Advisers and Moody's Economy.com. Estimates ranged from 1.3 million to 2.45 million jobs created or saved.

In November, the Congressional Budget Office released the most recent report, estimating that in the third quarter of 2011, Recovery Act policies:

• Raised real gross domestic product by between 0.3 percent and 1.9 percent. 

• Lowered the unemployment rate by between 0.2 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points.

• Increased the number of people employed by between 0.4 million and 2.4 million.

• Increased the number of full-time-equivalent jobs by 0.5 million to 3.3 million. (Increases in FTE jobs include shifts from part-time to full-time work or overtime and are thus generally larger than increases in the number of employed workers.) 
So, since the stimulus bill passed through August 2011, 2.4 million jobs were lost. But without it, 2.8 million to 4.8 million people might be out of work, according to the nonpartisan CBO and private economic analysts. 

Our ruling

Southerland's mailer accurately cites government employment data when it says that since February 2009, 2.4 million jobs have been lost. But it misleads when it says those jobs were lost ""since the 'Stimulus' bill was signed into law"" — even saying later that the approach ""failed to create jobs."" The reality is that government and independent economic analysts say policies in the Recovery Act salvaged half a million to 2.4 million jobs. Southerland can argue the stimulus wasn't worth what it cost, but it's inaccurate to say it didn't do anything for the economy. On balance, we find his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/dec/21/steve-southerland/rep-steve-southerland-says-over-24-million-jobs-ha/

Rhode Island State Rep. Michael Chippendale says the hydrogen sulfide emanating from the state landfill is the same gas used by the Germans in the Holocaust
","
It seems like there’s no escaping the noisome fumes wafting from the Central Landfill in Johnston.

Rhode Islanders near and far have complained that the rotten-egg odor generated by decomposing organic waste is worse than ever. The concentration of hydrogen sulfide, the gas that causes the smell, has been classified by the state Department of Health at the ""nuisance"" level. And the gas certainly is a nuisance. But is it also a threat to public health?

At a recent public forum at Johnston High School, state Rep. Michael W. Chippendale claimed that it is. A very serious one, at that. After outlining the various health consequences that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists for exposure to hydrogen sulfide  -- ranging from eye irritation at low levels to convulsions and death at high levels -- the Foster Republican made a claim at the Dec. 16 meeting that was hard to ignore.

""Hydrogen sulfide is, from just a brief search of the CDC’s website, one of the nastiest components, or chemical components, of some of the nastiest things that we’ve ever encountered in the world, including -- and I don’t want to sound overly dramatic if I haven’t already -- but including the actual chemicals used in the genocide of Jews in Germany,"" said Chippendale, a member of a legislative commission appointed to look into the stink from the landfill.

No doubt it’s a dramatic statement. Any reference to the Holocaust is bound to be. But is it true?

We called Chippendale, who guessed correctly why we wanted to talk to him. He was also quick to say that he thought he misspoke.

""It appears that I may have read things out of order,"" he said.

Chippendale said he prepared some notes before the forum that included comments on the health effects of hydrogen sulfide exposure and the statement related to Nazi gas chambers. But there was supposed to be a transition between the two topics, explaining that the toxicity of hydrogen sulfide is similar to the toxicity of another gas, hydrogen cyanide.

Chippendale said that when he spoke at the meeting, he mixed up his notes, so it wasn’t until after he mentioned the Holocaust that he drew the comparison between the toxicity of hydrogen sulfide and that of hydrogen cyanide.

And that’s where the problem arose. According to the CDC web page Chippendale used as a source, ""hydrogen cyanide, under the name Zyklon B, was used as a genocidal agent by the Germans in World War II."" Again, that’s hydrogen cyanide, not hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide has been found at the landfill; hydrogen cyanide has not.

We decided to do more research on hydrogen sulfide and its history. Was it ever used by the Germans in World War II or as a chemical weapon by anyone else? And is its toxicity really comparable to hydrogen cyanide?

Our first stop was the CDC website that Chippendale went to. In all the documents on hydrogen sulfide on the site, we found no reference to the Germans using the gas in World War II.

We then contacted Stephen L. Morgan, a chemistry professor at the University of South Carolina who has taught courses on the history of chemical warfare. His reaction to Chippendale’s statement at the forum?

""I think he’s confused,"" he said.

Morgan found two references to hydrogen sulfide’s use as a chemical weapon in World War I, but not in World War II.

But that doesn’t mean that the gas can’t be dangerous under certain conditions.

According to the CDC, hydrogen sulfide ""naturally occurs in the gases from volcanoes, sulfur springs, undersea vents, swamps and stagnant bodies of water and in crude petroleum and natural gas."" It also results from the decomposition of organic matter and can be found at wastewater treatment plants, landfills, slaughterhouses, petroleum refineries and other industrial facilities.

When levels are high enough, it can cause illness and, in some instances, death. According to the Rhode Island Department of Health, levels higher than 10 parts per million are unhealthy. Levels higher than 100 parts per million can trigger evacuation. The ""Handbook of Environmental Data on Organic Chemicals"" by Karel Verschueren says immediate death results from a level higher than 800 parts per million.

The CDC lists a number of incidents in which people have died from exposure to high levels of hydrogen sulfide. In fact, in 2001, a fisherman died on a Rhode Island boat and two others were injured after breathing in hydrogen sulfide inside the vessel’s hold.

The gas concentrations measured during visits to neighborhoods near the Central Landfill and at a fixed monitoring station at Wood Lake Park in Johnston have so far been far less than 1 part per million, according to Barbara Morin, supervising environmental scientist at the state Department of Environmental Management.

""It’s not at a level that’s going to poison anybody,"" she said.

Our ruling

There’s no question that in confined conditions and at extremely high concentrations hydrogen sulfide can be dangerous. There are recorded instances of people dying from exposure to the gas. But we could find no record of the Germans using it in their gas chambers during World War II.

Rep. Chippendale made a statement that was sure to draw attention.

""My sole intent was to make the point and drive it home with as strong a use of terms as I possibly could while remaining factually accurate,"" he told us.

But he wasn’t accurate. Give him credit for admitting that without much fuss. Nevertheless, we should all be more careful when trying to make a connection to something as emotionally charged as the Holocaust. We rule the statement False.

"['Georgia', 'Taxes', 'Grover Norquist']","
Letter warns Deal on taxes
","
Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal received a letter on Dec. 12 that likely gained the attention of his staff.

The author was Grover Norquist, the president of the Washington-based Americans for Tax Reform, best known for the pledge he asks political candidates to sign vowing to oppose and vote against tax increases. Nearly one-half of the members of Congress, including nine from Georgia, have signed the pledge. During his successful 2010 campaign, Deal promised ATR that he would oppose and veto all tax increases as governor.

Norquist, you see, has some pull.

His letter to the governor urged Georgia lawmakers considering a tax overhaul next year to pass legislation that is revenue-neutral. Norquist also warned officials here to stay away from tax increases in other areas. A portion of one sentence caught our attention.

""Last year’s target was tobacco; this year may be a repeat, or we may hear proposals for excise tax increases on alcohol or sweetened beverages,"" Norquist wrote. ""Whatever the case may be, targeted excise tax increases drive commerce across state lines and hurt small businesses’ bottom lines.""

The question for us: Do excise tax increases, as Norquist wrote, ""drive commerce across state lines""?

Excise taxes are placed on items such as cigarettes and alcohol. Most excise taxes are on cigarettes. Georgia, like most Southern states, has among the lowest excise taxes on cigarettes (37 cents a pack) in the nation. One news report earlier this said state Senate leaders are considering raising the cigarette tax by $1 a pack.

The Americans for Tax Reform staff argued its case that Norquist is right, pointing to the results of excise tax increases in three places, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and South Carolina. Here’s a closer look:

Chicago

ATR told us that Chicagoans flocked to neighboring Indiana when Cook County, which encompasses the Windy City, raised its cigarette tax by $1 in 2006. After the 2006 changes in Cook County, Chicagoans paid among the highest prices for cigarettes in the country. A team of University of Illinois-Chicago researchers found in a sample survey of discarded cigarette packs that 75 percent of them came from outside Cook County, The Huffington Post reported. The taxes on a pack of cigarettes in Chicago in 2007 was $4.05. The taxes were $1.37 outside city limits.

Washington, D.C.

ATR says Washington saw an 11 percent net decline in cigarette tax revenue after it raised the cigarette tax by 50 cents, to $2.50 a pack in 2009. Cigarette taxes in the nation’s capital were already higher than most states before 2009. In Virginia, the taxes for a pack of smokes is 30 cents, nearly the lowest in the nation. Missouri has the lowest cigarette taxes, 17 cents a pack, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-free Kids. City officials still expected to bank $30 million from the increase, although it was less than their initial projection of about $45 million.

South Carolina

Georgia saw a net increase in cigarette sales of nearly 1.3 million packs in the six months after South Carolina raised its excise tax rate in July 2010, ATR says. Cigarette tax revenue did decline slightly in South Carolina in the first 12 months since its increase, records show. South Carolina previously had the lowest cigarette tax in the nation, at 7 cents a pack. It’s now 57 cents a pack. Many smokers in the Palmetto State were not happy with the changes.

Matthew Farrelly, whose research on cigarette excise taxes has been used by others, said some people will travel across state lines to buy cigarettes once excise taxes are raised. Other smokers will buy by the carton or choose a lesser brand to save money, he said. Farrelly contends it’s ""bogus"" for anyone to say large numbers of smokers will rush to another state to buy cigarettes once an increase takes effect because few Americans live near a border. He also noted the states that raise their excise taxes eventually make a profit.

""On net, increases in taxes on cigarettes lead to revenue all the time,"" said Farrelly, senior director, RTI International Public Healthy Policy Research Program, headquartered near Raleigh, N.C.

Our conclusion:

Norquist has a good argument for his basic point, based on the research we’ve seen and people we’ve interviewed. The difference in taxes between some places, however, is so large ($2.20 a pack between Washington, D.C., and Virginia) that it adds some important context to this argument. With that additional bit of information, we rate Norquist’s claim as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/dec/21/grover-norquist/letter-warns-deal-taxes/
"['Oregon', 'Trade', 'Ron Wyden']","
Will free trade deal drop the price of Oregon canned blueberries in South Korea?
","
U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden held up a can of Oregon Fruit Products blueberries at the Oregon Business Summit last week as an example of the state’s market expansion abroad. The berries are picked in the Willamette Valley, packed in light syrup and, according to Wyden, will be less costly for South Koreans thanks to a recent trade agreement.

""Because of the Korean free trade agreement, South Koreans who want Oregon blueberries are gonna see their prices go down because we will be getting rid of a 45 percent tariff on this Oregon product,"" he said. ""That's what I mean when I'm talking about expanding trade.""

As we’ve previously noted, sometimes we check a statement because it strikes us as wrong. Other times, we just want to learn more. And in this case, we just wanted to know more about the trade agreement and how it might affect Oregon products, in this case, our plump, nutritious, not-too-sweet blueberries.

The pact, years in the negotiating, should make it easier to sell U.S. products to 49 million consumers in South Korea. Tariffs imposed on U.S. goods will be phased out or eliminated outright. So, the 40 percent tariff on U.S. muscle beef will be eliminated over 15 years. Fresh cherries, with its 24 percent tariff, will be duty-free as soon as the pact is in effect. The same goes for dried apricots, wine and grape juice.

The tariff on canned blueberries is now 45 percent, as Wyden said. Unlike the tax on fresh cherries, the tax on canned blueberries will be phased out to zero over a decade. In 2012, the tariff will drop to 40.5 percent and in 2013, the tariff will be 36 percent. In 2016, the tariff will be 22.50 percent and in 2021, zero percent.

It’s not clear when the new tariff rate will kick in. Dalton Hobbs, assistant director of the Oregon Department of Agriculture, says that while the pact technically is in effect now, practically speaking it’s not. ""People who were waiting for this are probably going to sit on the sidelines for another few weeks until all of the mechanisms are fully in place for products to move,"" he said.

South Korea is Oregon’s fifth largest export market, accounting for nearly $1 billion in sales last year. Hobbs estimates that Oregon producers will see an increase in sales in the $50 million to $100 million range over the next 12 months. That should increase significantly, Hobbs said.

We asked Joseph Peterson, the president of Oregon Fruit Products, whether he anticipated a cost reduction for South Korean consumers. He explained that his sell price will stay the same, because the burden of the tariff is borne by the importer, and eventually the consumer.

""As that duty goes away, the importer's cost will be less,"" he said. The price reduction ""should go all the way to the consumer.""

We called the Office of the United States Trade Representative to see how eliminating a tariff over the longer term usually affects the price of the commodity.

""Tariff reductions should lower prices of those goods receiving the tariff reductions,"" Carol Guthrie, an official at the office, said in an e-mail. ""The price reduction may not equal the tariff reduction on a one-to-one basis (the issue of whether companies fully pass through the savings to the final consumer).

""If consumer prices have gone up due to inflation, etc over the phase in period, then these prices would have been even higher if the tariffs were not reduced.""

Already, 2011 has been a landmark year for Oregon blueberries in South Korea. In a separate move, food officials there have authorized for import the first ever fresh blueberries from the United States. Of course, they will come from Oregon. By next summer, our blueberries should join berries from British Columbia and Chile in Korean markets.

""Korea is just wild for blueberries, dermal cream, food products, it’s in other items as well, blueberry shampoo, all manner of consumer goods,"" says Bryan Ostlund, executive director of the Oregon Blueberry Commission in Salem.

But we digress.

In a printed version of the speech circulated by Wyden’s office, the senator was supposed to hold up the can of blueberries and say that ""South Koreans who want Oregon blueberries are now paying 45 percent less per can.""

It’s a good thing he didn’t end up saying that. Such a statement would have been False. But what Wyden said is fairly accurate.

It makes sense that South Koreans who want canned blueberries from Oregon should see prices go down -- or not increase as much -- over time, because the tariff on the product will decrease. But the tariff is going to be phased in slowly, so the full savings are still a ways off. We think Wyden’s statement needs that clarification.

Based on our findings, we rate the statement Mostly True: accurate but needing additional information.

Rhode Island activist says the state has the highest rate of foreclosures in the nation
","
There's no doubt that Rhode Island's economy is in rough shape, and one element of that problem is the number of people poised to lose their homes because they can't make their mortgage payments.

During a Dec. 10, State House rally to highlight the plight of the homeless, and some legislative proposals to relieve it, Theresa Price, a board member of Direct Action for Rights and Equality (DARE), complained about the number of evictions caused by banks taking over properties.

""Rhode Island is leading our nation in foreclosures,"" she said.

Two days after the rally, Jim Ryczek, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition for the Homeless, sent us an unsolicited e-mail saying Price had misspoke. ""Rhode Island ranks highest in New England in both foreclosure starts and serious delinquencies, not the entire nation. We did not mean to claim the lead for the entire U.S.""

That sentiment was echoed by Christopher Rotondo, a DARE organizer, when we called to get the source of Price’s numbers.

Price did not respond to repeated requests for a comment.

We decided we needed to get the facts ourselves.

We found earlier numbers on various websites confirming that Rhode Island isn't at the top of the list. But we weren't sure if they were the latest numbers.

The Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade association that releases quarterly statistics from more than 120 real estate companies that submit delinquency and foreclosure counts, sent us its latest numbers from July through September 2011. They reported:

* 4.27 percent of Rhode Island's housing units are in the foreclosure process. Rhode Island ranks 12th, not first. Connecticut (4.8 percent) and Maine (5.7 percent) rank even higher. Florida, at 14.5 percent, is at the top of the list.

* 1.66 percent of the state's housing units entered the foreclosure process during the third quarter of 2011. Here, we had the dubious distinction of being tops in New England and fourth in the nation. Only three other states -- Arizona (1.67 percent), Florida (1.96 percent) and Nevada (2.48 percent) -- had higher rates.

* 8.48 percent of the state's housing units are owned by people who are at least one payment behind on their mortgage. Rhode Island ranks 19th by that measure, the worst in New England. Mississippi, at 13.2 percent, is number one.

We also checked with RealtyTrac, an online marketplace for foreclosed properties. It reported on Dec. 15 that, in November, one in every 954 Rhode Island units had been the subject of a foreclosure filing, putting us 21st in the nation for the second month in a row. In New England, New Hampshire had a worse rate - 1 in 735.

Rhode Island fares better than the national average of 1 in 579.

Different organizations collect their numbers differently, warned Brenda Clement, executive director of the Housing Action Coalition of Rhode Island. Nonetheless, ""Rhode Island has, from the very start of this foreclosure mess, consistently ranked in the top ten and usually in the top five across the country in terms of foreclosures and highest in New England,"" Clement said.

Our ruling

In the push to rally support for legislation to fight homelessness, DARE official Theresa Price said, ""Rhode Island is leading our nation in foreclosures.""

Clearly that's not the case. Other states consistently have worse rates when it comes to foreclosures, although Rhode Island's -- whether you look at new foreclosures, ongoing foreclosures or delinquent payments -- are well above the national average.

If Price had said we lead New England, that statement would not have been clearly true either. Depending on how the data are collected, people in other nearby states may face a greater foreclosure threat.

Ryczek, of the Coalition for the Homeless, gave a more accurate characterization of the New England figures after the fact.

But, in her speech to hundreds of people outside the State House, Price wasn’t talking about New England. She was talking about the United States. Her fallacious foreclosure factoid is False.

Newt Gingrich says Supreme Court crossed major threshold with 1958 case
","During the Dec. 18, 2011, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich had an extended and often pointed conversation with host Bob Schieffer about his views on how the judiciary relates to the other branches of government. In the interview, Gingrich explained his position that judges, at least in some circumstances, should be called to account for their decisions that flout the public will, either by being brought before Congress or in some cases by being removed from office. In the days before the interview, Gingrich had been pointing voters to a paper he had written about the issue. In the paper, Gingrich suggested a number of options for reining in the judiciary, including ""judicial accountability hearings"" before Congress, impeachment of judges, defunding or eliminating lower courts and changing how law schools teach the issue of judicial checks and balances Such ideas drew criticism from legal observers, including two former attorneys general who served under President George W. Bush. Fox News reported that Michael Mukasey said that some of the ideas are ""dangerous, ridiculous, totally irresponsible, outrageous, off-the-wall and would reduce the entire judicial system to a spectacle."" Alberto Gonzales said that the country’s greatness is ""built upon the foundation of the rule of law. And one of the things that makes it great and (ensures that) the rule of law is protected by having a strong independent judiciary."" But on Face the Nation, Gingrich doubled down. He told Schieffer, ""You have this real problem that since 1958, when the Warren court asserted by itself that the Supreme Court was supreme over the president and the Congress, you've had a fundamental assault on our liberties by the courts. You have an increasingly arrogant judiciary. And the question is, is there anything we the American people can do? Well, the standard conservative answer has been, well, eventually we'll appoint good judges. I think that's inadequate."" We decided to look at his claim that in 1958, ""the Warren court asserted by itself that the Supreme Court was supreme over the president and the Congress."" It’s one of the linchpins of Gingrich’s ideas on the judiciary, one he cited both in the Face the Nation interview and in the paper he wrote. Cooper vs. Aaron The 1958 case in question is Cooper vs. Aaron, which grew out of opposition by the Arkansas state government to school desegregation ordered by the Supreme Court in the landmark case Brown vs. Board of Education. In its unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court wrote that ""this Court cannot countenance a claim by the Governor and Legislature of a State that there is no duty on state officials to obey federal court orders resting on this Court's considered interpretation of the United States Constitution in Brown vs. Board of Education."" In his paper, Gingrich places special emphasis on the role of Cooper vs. Aaron in shaping how the judiciary operates today, calling it a ""power grab"" that is ""a modern phenomenon and a dramatic break from all previous American history."" Here’s a portion of his argument: ""If the Supreme Court ruled that two plus two equal five, would the executive and legislative branches have to agree? Would we have to pass a Constitutional amendment to overrule the Court and reassert that two plus two equals four? ""In 1958, all nine sitting justices of the Supreme Court signed on to a judicial opinion in the case Cooper vs. Aaron that asserted that the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Constitution was supreme in importance to the constitutional interpretation of the other two branches of government, and that this judicial supremacy, all nine justices asserted, is a ‘permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system.’ ""The Supreme Court assertions in Cooper vs. Aaron are factually and historically false. Nevertheless, following Cooper vs. Aaron, the executive and legislative branches have largely acted as if the Constitution empowered the Supreme Court with final decision making authority about the meaning of the Constitution. The executive and legislative branches have further behaved as if they have no choice but to give total deference to Supreme Court decisions, even if the executive and/or legislative branch believes the Supreme Court has seriously erred in its constitutional judgments."" Legal experts we spoke to agreed that Cooper vs. Aaron was, and remains, an important case on the question of judicial power. But many of the same experts added that Gingrich has exaggerated the case’s significance and meaning. We see two significant problems with how Gingrich used the example of Cooper vs. Aaron. Gingrich’s focus on Cooper vs. Aaron wrongly ignores earlier legal precedents Cooper vs. Aaron did not assert ""by itself"" the primacy of the Supreme Court, as Gingrich said. It may have offered an especially clear and forceful distillation of that principle, but the view did not emerge suddenly from the minds of the 1958 court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren -- a jurist, not coincidentally, who was unloved by many conservatives on ideological grounds. The notion that the Supreme Court can overrule the other branches of government dates back to the landmark case of Marbury vs. Madison in 1803. ""It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is,"" wrote the justices, led by Chief Justice John Marshall. ""Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each. … This is of the very essence of judicial duty."" The ruling goes on to state that ""the judicial power of the United States is extended to all cases arising under the constitution,"" and it backs the ""principle, supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void, and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument."" Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, said that ""Cooper vs. Aaron is usually taken as the canonical case for judicial supremacy, so it’s not inappropriate to refer to it in this context. But Gingrich is stretching the point to suggest that this was a Warren court invention. The idea that the Supreme Court’s judgment about the meaning and requirements of the Constitution takes priority over that of other governmental actors is clearly articulated in Marbury vs. Madison, which Cooper relies on."" Jesse Choper, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, added that one can cite a whole host of cases prior to 1958 in which the Supreme Court affirmatively blocked actions by both Congress and the president on constitutional grounds. ""There’s a zillion of those,"" Choper said. ""All the New Deal cases were about that. And there are certainly cases in which the Supreme Court has held the executive branch unconstitutional."" Probably the biggest, he said, was Youngstown Co. vs. Sawyer (1952), in which the court overruled an executive order by President Harry Truman to nationalize steel mills to avert a nationwide strike. Contrary to what Gingrich says, many of the experts said, there was not a bright line between pre-1958 and post-1958 Supreme Court jurisprudence. Gingrich is incorrect if he’s suggesting that ""this is new or different than what largely happened during the period prior to 1958,"" said Roger Pilon, vice president for legal affairs at the libertarian Cato Institute. All of this said, most of our experts agreed that Gingrich isn’t totally off-base about Cooper. Several noted that the decision’s language is especially forceful, perhaps because it came in reaction to the ""massive resistance"" to desegregation that Brown had sparked. For instance, the justices in Cooper asserted ""the basic principle that the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution, and that principle has ever since been respected by this Court and the Country as a permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system."" ""No matter how you read it, (that is) a big step beyond Marbury,"" said Vik Amar, a University of California at Davis law professor. ""Marbury said that courts have the power and duty to interpret the constitution, and that they have to do so independently. It didn’t say that other branches always had to fall in line with the courts’ interpretations, and it certainly didn’t say other branches have no interpretive role to play."" In addition, several experts noted that Gingrich has a point when he details past historical examples of presidents refusing to bend to the Supreme Court in every instance. ""Thomas Jefferson and others not only denounced Marbury vs. Madison as wrong but also asserted that the executive and judicial branches had the power to decide for themselves what is the meaning of the Constitution,"" said legal commentator Stuart Taylor Jr. Finally, there is a longstanding -- though controversial -- strain of thinking that echoes Gingrich’s views. Cooper vs. Aaron has been ""highly criticized, not just on the right but also on the left,"" said Brad Snyder, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin. Then-Attorney General Edwin Meese argued in a high-profile 1986 speech that in Cooper, the court ""appeared to arrive at conclusions about its power that would have shocked men like John Marshall. ... Obviously the decision was binding on the parties in the case, but the implication that everyone would have to accept its judgments uncritically, that it was a decision from which there could be no appeal, was astonishing...."" Taylor said that the general acquiescence by the president and Congress to the Supreme Court over the course of history comes from pragmatic reasons. ""The alternative is that each branch, and, worse, perhaps even the states, would disregard Supreme Court rulings they did not like, moving from a ‘rule of law’ society toward something more chaotic,"" he said. Cooper vs. Aaron doesn’t explicitly deal with the presidency or Congress at all Despite what Gingrich said on Face the Nation, Cooper vs. Aaron addressed actions of state-government officials, not the president or Congress. ""Cooper vs. Aaron was about the supremacy of federal law over the states,"" said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean the law school at the University of California at Irvine. ""It had nothing to do with the Supreme Court relative to Congress and the president. It was about whether Arkansas could disregard a federal court order for desegregation."" Roosevelt agreed. ""Giving the Supreme Court the last word vis-a-vis state officials is less controversial than giving it the last word vis-a-vis the other branches of the federal government,"" Roosevelt said. On these grounds, ""the claim that Cooper established judicial supremacy over the President and Congress is substantially misleading."" Gingrich's larger argument While it's beyond the scope of this fact-check, we do think it's worth noting that almost all the experts we asked had serious problems with Gingrich's proposed policies. ""The supremacy of judicial review has served to protect our constitutional rights for over two centuries,"" said Ronald Rotunda, a law professor at Chapman University. ""It was a unanimous decision, signed by each of the nine justices,"" said Chemerinsky, a leading liberal in legal thinking. ""It emphatically says that federal law is supreme and court orders must be complied with. It is hard to imagine a less controversial decision in hindsight."" Douglas Kmiec, a Pepperdine University law professor who held top Justice Department posts under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, concurred. Gingrich’s solution, Kmiec said, ""is to go to war with the basic idea expressed in every civics class by every school child -- namely, judges interpret that which is written down as law, and state executives in administering the interpreted laws can’t reinterpret them, or the whole system falls. … As I see, it Newt's argument has the tendency to wrongly invite citizens to be mad over nothing, or at least nothing he has addressed. This will prompt unknowing citizens to hold courts in the same low regard as they hold Congress itself. It also suggests a mind more inclined to invent trivial, hypothetical problems, which undermines the fragile commitment to the rule of law needed to fairly resolve real cases or controversies."" Our ruling In attacking the Supreme Court for its power relative to the other branches of government, it’s understandable that Ginrgich has zeroed in on Cooper vs. Aaron. It is an unusually strong statement of the court’s primacy. But in doing so, Gingrich gets two things wrong, leaving out crucial context. He says the decision claimed that ""the Supreme Court was supreme over the president and the Congress,"" when in fact the decision dealt with the court’s primacy over state officials. Meanwhile, he exaggerates how much of a watershed the 1958 decision was. There was a tradition of judicial review going back to 1803, and the court had repeatedly curtailed both presidential and congressional power in the years between. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/154167aa-a11c-47e9-973f-f2bb7d90a584",/factchecks/2011/dec/20/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-supreme-court-crossed-major-thr/

Newt Gingrich says Freddie Mac, electric co-ops and credit unions are similar organizations
","
Newt Gingrich’s relationship with Freddie Mac -- the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association -- has become a political briar patch for the former House speaker and Republican presidential candidate.  His opponents, including Ron Paul, Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry, cast him as a lobbyist in everything but name who landed over $1.6 million in fees from the one of the biggest players in the home mortgage industry.

Gingrich states flatly he never lobbied on behalf of Freddie Mac, but in the last debate before the Iowa caucuses, Gingrich had to explain another wrinkle in his past dealings with Freddie. One of the panelists asked him about his words from 2007 ""I like the GSE, or government sponsored enterprise like Freddie Mac, model.""

Gingrich took the broad view to defend his position, saying ""when you look for example at electric membership co-ops, and you look at credit unions, there are a lot of government sponsored enterprises that are awfully important and do an awfully good job.""

So we ask, was that a fair comparison? Are electric co-ops and credit unions the same as government sponsored enterprises, GSE’s, like Freddie Mac?

There is one similarity between a GSE and a credit union or an electric co-op. Neither pays federal or state income taxes. But Patrick Lavigne, spokesman for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), said GSE  ""is not a term that I’ve heard applied to electric coops before.""

Nor, as we learned, would he be likely to. The term GSE applies to just a handful of very particular institutions. It takes a specific act of congress to create one, usually to ease the flow of money to a certain industry, like housing or agriculture. Glossaries like Investopedia define GSE’s as ""(p)rivately held corporations with public purposes created by the U.S. Congress to reduce the cost of capital for certain borrowing sectors of the economy.""

When the White House submits its annual budget, it includes the GSE’s, and the list isn’t long.  There are the Agricultural Credit Bank and Farm Credit Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. And that’s it. No electric co-ops.No credit unions.

The 2012 White House budget explains that Congress chartered Freddie Mac in 1970 to facilitate ""the flow of investment dollars from the capital markets to mortgage lenders and ultimately, to homebuyers.""

A credit union or an electric co-op is born completely differently.  They come into being only when a group of local investors pool their money.The country’s very first credit union was started in 1908 by a priest in Manchester, N.H., to provide credit to the factory workers in the textile mills.  Washington played no role at all.

Later, the federal government offered both funding assistance and regulatory guidelines. Local groups need to apply to a government agency for recognition as a nonprofit, member-owed entity.  By the way, that’s another difference. Freddie Mac is owned by stockholders. Co-ops are owned by their members, the people who use them. Levine, with the NRECA, says electric co-ops started in the 1930’s when ""farmers would each throw $5 dollars into the hat and then ask Washington for a loan for a transformer or some power lines.""

Back then, and today, those loans would come with a very low interest rate but a GSE such as Freddie Mac was treated even more favorably. It was formed with a direct line of credit into the federal Treasury -- upwards of $2 billion. ""They could borrow money cheaper than anyone except Uncle Sam himself,"" said Kathleen Day, a former Washington Post reporter who covered the GSE’s for over two decades.

The deal for Freddie Mac got even better. Thanks to that intimate association with the federal government, Day says ""the markets perceived them as something that was backed by Washington and invested at a very low cost ... That’s what allowed it to grow.""

We asked the Gingrich campaign to send us any source that describes a credit union or a electric co-op as a GSE. We did not hear back.

John Berlau, a policy director with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think tank that supports limited government and free markets, says he knows of no such description. In an email, he wrote ""credit union officials I have talked to are fearful that Gingrich's false claim that they are a type of GSE may unjustly harm their image among the public and legislators.""

Our Ruling:

Gingrich spoke of credit unions and electric cooperatives as if they were the same sort of entities as Freddie Mac. We find no support for that and find major differences in how they are created and operate compared with GSEs. Congress created Freddie Mac, as it does every GSE,  by passing a specific law to bring it into being. Freddie Mac has stockholders and a direct line of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The term, Government Sponsored Enterprise, applies only to a handful of financial entities listed in the federal budget.

None of those characteristics apply to credit unions and electric cooperatives.

Gingrich was paid by Freddie Mac to provide strategic advice, so he should be familiar with government sponsored entities and know what is and isn’t a GSE.  But Gingrich got it wrong twice during the debate in Iowa.

Michelle Obama credits president for new G.I. Bill
","
To mark the end of combat in Iraq and the return of U.S. troops in time for the holidays, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama spoke at Fort Bragg, N.C., on Dec. 14, 2011.

Michelle Obama thanked service members and their families for their sacrifices and touted her husband’s work in supporting returning veterans.

She mentioned improved mental health care for veterans and tax cuts for businesses that hire veterans. She also said this of her husband: ""He's helped more than half a million veterans and military family members go to college through the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill.""

That makes it sound like the G.I. Bill was a major initiative of President Obama. But it was actually signed into law by his predecessor.

The new GI Bill

The bill, officially called the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, was introduced by Sen. Jim Webb, a Democrat from Virginia and Vietnam War veteran. It paid for veterans who served at least three years after Sept. 11, 2001, to attend a public college or university for free for four years, provided a monthly housing stipend and covered up to $1,000 a year for books.

Service members who agreed to serve four more years in the military had the option of transferring the benefit to their spouses or children. With the backing of numerous veterans groups, the bill was hailed as the most comprehensive educational benefits program since the original G.I. Bill was enacted in the World War II era.

Obama, then a senator campaigning for president, supported the bill, along with most other members of Congress. It was opposed by President George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, who feared the generous education perk might hurt military retention.

Obama voted for it when it came up in the Senate in May 2008, McCain was absent, and Bush ended up signing it into law.

The benefits kicked in Aug. 1, 2009, after Obama had moved into the White House. As expected, tens of thousands of service members took advantage, and the Department of Veterans Affairs quickly fell behind in covering payments. Veterans reported having to take out loans to cover education costs while they waited for their checks from the government.

According to news reports, the VA had mostly cleared the backlog by February of 2010.

The expansion

In December 2010, Congress passed another bill that enhanced the benefits of the new G.I. Bill. Dubbed ""G.I. Bill 2.0,"" it expanded eligibility for reserve members and National Guard members who were activated after 9/11, allowed tuition benefits to be used beyond college campuses at vocational and on-the-job training programs and expanded the housing allowance to distance learners.

The bill, the Post-9/11 Veterans Education Assistance Improvements Act of 2010,  was signed by Obama on Jan. 4, 2011.

When we contacted the White House for documentation of Michelle Obama’s statement, a spokesman provided us statistics on the 2008 law:

* Approximately $15.02 billion in Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit payments.
* 649,573 individuals have received benefits since August 1, 2009.  
* Fall enrollment is 428,870 individuals.  

Who gets the credit?

Our key question about this claim is not whether veterans have been helped by the law, but whether Obama is the chief helper, as the First Lady's speech implied.

We contacted veterans groups for their input. All agreed with the 500,000-plus figure Mrs. Obama mentioned.

""In general, the numbers have gone up dramatically,"" said Robert Norton, a retired Army colonel and deputy director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America.

He noted that the legislation had broad bipartisan support in Congress and that Bush ended up supporting it because of the provision allowing benefits to be transferred to family members.

But at that time, Obama was just one vote. Michael Dakduk, executive director of Student Veterans of America, said Obama ""can take as much credit as every other politician in Congress in ‘07. (The new G.I. Bill) was supported by virtually everyone.""

He said it's a stretch to suggest Obama was the driving force.

""It’s not appropriate. He doesn’t deserve that,"" Dakduk said.

Tom Tarantino, senior legislative associate for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, focused on the 2011 law. He said ""it is fair to say that the president has been supportive of expanding benefits.""

Tarantino also credited the Obama administration with helping clear the backlog at the VA that left veterans waiting for their money.

""When VA checks were late in the first semester, it was the White House that pressured (or directed) the VA to provide advances to veterans waiting for their living stipend. The White House has also been a driving force behind modernizing the VA benefits process that has resulted in an automated NGIB process that has had little to no late payments this school year,"" Tarantino said.

Our ruling

Michelle Obama said her husband has ""helped more than half a million veterans and military family members go to college through the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill.""

Michelle Obama made it sound like the bill was a major legislative priority for him, but it was signed by his predecessor.  

Senator Obama voted for the new G.I. Bill. (And he wasn’t exactly going out on a political limb by favoring a law that enhanced benefits for military service members in the midst of two wars.)

However, Obama did sign another bill in 2011 expanding benefits. The two laws together have helped more than 600,000 men and women returning from war find their way toward new careers, according to the VA. Obama deserves some credit for that achievement, but he's just one of many.

DNC says Mitt Romney and staff cost Massachusetts taxpayers $100,000
","
For some opponents, the issue of electronic records during Mitt Romney’s time as Massachusetts governor has become the $100,000 question.

In an advertisement released earlier this month, the Democratic National Committee accused members of the Romney administration of costing taxpayers $100,000 when they purchased their computer hard drives and wiped them clean as they left office in 2006.

""When Mitt Romney left the Massachusetts governor's office, e-mails were deleted, servers wiped clean and computer hard drives went out the door with his top aides,"" the narrator reads in the ad, released December 6, 2011. ""His and his staff's efforts cost taxpayers $100,000. All this raises one important question, what is Mitt Romney hiding?""

The records issue has been well documented in recent months. Romney acknowledged in November that staff members purchased their computer hard drives as they left office. He maintained his staff did not break the law, and last month PolitiFact checked his claim that if they had turned over their records to the following administration, they would have been first. We rated the claim True.

But did the Romney administration’s actions really cost taxpayers $100,000?

The computer hard drives themselves didn’t cost nearly that much, according to reports.

The Boston Globe, which first broke the records story last month, reported that 11 aides purchased their hard drives at the time, paying $65 dollars each for a total of $715. The $65 figure equaled both the price of a new hard drive and the installation costs, and staff members purchased the hard drives with their own money, according to Terry Dolan, who served as director of administration for six governors, including Romney, between 1985 and 2008.

""That was effectively at no cost to the Commonwealth,"" Dolan said Thursday. ""They paid the cost of a replacement hard drive. They didn’t buy the monitor, the speakers, the whole nine yards.""

The costs don’t end there, however.

Around the time Romney aides purchased the hard drives in late 2006, his administration agreed to a new lease with their computer provider, Ontario Investments, Inc., of New York. The governor’s office was 18 months into a three-year, $108,000 lease, the first ever for the governor’s office, which had previously purchased all its computers, Dolan said. But office officials opted out of that agreement in December 2006 in favor of a new three-year, $205,900 contract to upgrade the technology.

The new lease covered the same 115 computers as the original agreement, according to the contract, but added new bells and whistles.

""They were 18-month old computers that were functional,"" Dolan said. ""We got bigger screens. … I'm not sure (the old computers) had CD drives in them at that time.""

By a simple comparison, the two different lease documents show that the governor’s office paid about $97,000 more for the second lease than for the original. But, does this mean it cost taxpayers that much? Not so fast, Dolan says.

Eighteen months remained on the original lease when administration officials initiated the new, more expensive agreement, according to the lease documents. This means administration officials would have had to renew, renegotiate or search for a new contract by June 2008, resulting in additional costs.

To keep calculations even, then, you need to measure the difference between the two agreements through June 2008, when the original was set to expire.

The original $108,000 lease, initially expected to run from June 2005 to June 2008, averaged a monthly cost of $3,000, while the second, which ran from December 2006 to December 2009, averaged $5,719 per month.

The difference between the two monthly charges is $2,719, and multiplied by the 18 months remaining on the original lease equals a total difference of $48,942 -- about half of the DNC’s $100,000 figure, a figure first reported December 6 by Reuters.

One further note: The DNC ad indicates that Romney’s staff scrapped the original computer lease because they no longer contained hard drives, which is not true, according to Dolan, Romney’s director of administration.

Administration officials had already been working on the new lease when the staff members bought the hard drives, she said Thursday.

""The decision was made to replace all the computers, and then inquiries were made (about buying the hard drives),"" Dolan said. ""To my recollection, it was something like, ‘Well, as long as the computers are going back … maybe we can keep the hard drives.’""

Romney’s campaign staff did not return requests for comment.

Our ruling:

The total difference between the original lease and the second computer contract signed by the Romney administration was about $97,000, close to the $100,000 mentioned in the DNC ad. But this is not an apples to apples comparison. Rather, the total difference in cost passed on to taxpayers during the term of the first lease was about $49,000 -- not quite half of the DNC total.
Further, administration officials had already been looking into a new computer lease when the aides purchased the hard drives, so the lease costs are not a direct result of the sale of the hard drives, as the DNC alleges.

Rick Perry says a study found that Massachusetts lost 18,000 jobs because of a mandate in its health care law
","
Texas Gov. Rick Perry continues to hit fellow GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, over similarities between the state health care plan Romney signed in 2006 and the federal act that President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. 
At the Dec. 10, 2011, debate in Iowa, Perry said he was stunned by Romney’s earlier comment that he would have told President Barack Obama he was headed in the wrong direction on health care, because ""that is exactly the path that you've taken Massachusetts."" Perry continued: ""The Beacon Hill study itself said that there’s been 18,000 jobs lost because of that individual mandate."" Perry was referring to the requirement in the Massachusetts law, also found in the national one, that individuals buy health insurance or pay a fine. 
We wondered whether Perry was right about the study and the Massachusetts mandate's impact on jobs in the state. Fortunately, PolitiFact previously looked into a similar Perry claim, made in an Oct. 10 video posted online by the Texan's campaign: ""Romneycare killed 18,000 jobs."" 
""Romneycare"" is a label that critics have applied to the Massachusetts health care law, which is similar in its broad outline to the national health care law. 
In addition to including an individual mandate, the Massachusetts and federal laws both leave in place the existing insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. Both also seek to reduce the number of uninsured residents by expanding Medicaid and offering subsidies to help moderate-income people buy insurance. Companies that don't offer insurance have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business and a few other cases. The state and national laws also each provide for voluntary ""exchanges"" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. The exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels. 
Both the statement in the Perry video and the statement Perry made in the Dec. 10 debate were based on a September 2011 study by the Beacon Hill Institute, a Boston-based economics research group that is affiliated with Suffolk University and supports ""limited government, fiscal responsibility and free markets."" 
Both statements suggest that 18,000 actual jobs were eliminated because of the Massachusetts law. In fact, however, the Beacon Hill study makes the more modest assertion that the law prevented 18,000 jobs from being created. 
The study is based on the idea that the Massachusetts law drove up health care costs for state government (through increased Medicaid spending) and for individuals and businesses (through higher health insurance premiums), which in turn dampened job growth. Using a computer program that models how policies could affect the state’s economy, the Beacon Hill researchers estimated that the state’s economy created 18,313 fewer jobs in 2010 than it would have without the health care law. 
To put the so-called uncreated jobs in perspective, the Massachusetts workforce was about 3.5 million people in July 2010, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployed numbered about 293,000. 
We should note here that reports like this one largely depend on the underlying economic assumptions behind the economic model that is used. Right-leaning and left-leaning groups often come up with different numbers when looking at the same policies. In this case, we were unable to find any other studies that looked at the effects of the Massachusetts health care law on employment. 
Our friends at Factcheck.org checked out the 18,000 number in September after Perry started making the claim on the campaign trail. They concluded that the figure was an estimate that could neither be proved nor disproved after gleaning mixed opinions in Massachusetts on whether the law hurt actual job growth. 
Separately, we recalled an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office of how many jobs might be lost or gained nationwide because of the 2010 federal health care law. The analysis found that the law would reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by about 800,000 jobs, partly because businesses facing higher costs would decide not to add workers but mostly because people working jobs simply to retain their existing health insurance would be able to leave those jobs and buy insurance on their own. 
Our ruling 
In the Dec. 10 debate, Perry cited a study that found increased costs led businesses to create fewer jobs. That is certainly plausible, although we found no other research supporting that figure. 
More significantly, Perry's statement makes it sound as if the study says existing jobs in Massachusetts were vanquished. Instead, it asserts that 18,000 jobs were not created in the first place. 
Also, Perry’s claim blames one part of the health care law — the individual mandate — for the effect on employment, while the study considers the impact of the entire law. That is, it doesn't specify which parts most influenced the state’s economy. 
A single study gives Perry's statement an element of truth. But his claim leaves the misimpression that 18,000 existing jobs went away because of the Massachusetts law and incorrectly says a single part of the law was to blame. His statement rates Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/dec/19/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-study-found-massachusetts-lost-180/

State Sen. Mike Doherty claims financial collapse led to no prosecutions, hearings or reforms
","
When former New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine was ordered to appear Dec. 8 before a House committee investigating the collapse of brokerage MF Global, it was a landmark moment, according to one state senator.

Corzine’s testimony marked the first time that federal officials had taken any action dealing with Wall Street in response to the financial crisis that rocked the world a few years ago, state Sen. Michael Doherty (R-Warren) said in a Dec. 9 news release.

""Following the catastrophic, cascading collapse of major investment banks on Wall Street in 2007, which caused the current global economic recession, the United States Government held no one accountable,"" Doherty said. ""Nobody was prosecuted, no hearings were held and no reforms were implemented.

""It is obvious to everyone on Main Street, from the Occupy camps to the Tea Party, that Wall Street is broken. Yet only yesterday did the U.S. Congress take any action.""

No prosecutions, no hearings, no reforms? PolitiFact New Jersey says: No way!

Since the financial crisis began in 2008 -- not 2007, senator -- federal officials have held numerous public hearings and passed a financial reform law, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

While high-profile executives on Wall Street have not faced criminal charges, federal officials have prosecuted cases against other individuals for financial crimes before and during the time of the economic collapse.

Doherty told us his claims are supported by a Dec. 4 segment on 60 Minutes on CBS, which stated ""there has not been a single prosecution of a high-ranking Wall Street executive or major financial firm.""

In an email, Doherty also responded to our charge about the Dodd-Frank Act: ""Regarding reform, there has been no reform. If there was reform, how did MF Global take $1.2 Billion of client money from segregated client accounts and now they don’t know where the money went?  Reform would have stopped that from happening.""

Let’s review what PolitiFact New Jersey found:

It’s true that prominent Wall Street executives have not been prosecuted, according to various news reports. But it’s wrong for Doherty to say ""nobody"" has.

For example, Lee Farkas was convicted in April of helping to commit a more than $2.9 billion fraud scheme that contributed to the collapse of Alabama-based Colonial Bank, one of the 25 largest banks in the country in 2009.

Now, let’s talk about those hearings and financial reform.

Charged with examining the causes of the financial crisis, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission ""held 19 days of public hearings"" in 2010, according to its website.

Congressional committees and subcommittees also have held hearings about the financial crisis. In April 2010, a Senate subcommittee held four hearings about the causes and effects of the crisis, including one when Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein testified.

About three months later, President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act.

The reform measures within that legislation include setting up a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. U.S. Senate Republicans recently blocked the nomination for the bureau’s first director.

So, contrary to what Doherty claimed, it’s clear that federal officials have conducted hearings and passed financial reform in the wake of the financial crisis.

Doherty also referred to the ""current global economic recession,"" but economists with the National Bureau of Economic Research have said the recession in the United States ended in June 2009.

Our ruling

In a news release, Doherty claimed that following the collapse of major investment banks on Wall Street in 2007, ""nobody was prosecuted, no hearings were held and no reforms were implemented.""

But major investment banks collapsed in 2008 and there have been some prosecutions, although not targeting high-profile Wall Street executives. Numerous hearings have been held and a financial reform law was enacted last year.

Doherty has a point about the lack of prosecutions against high-profile Wall Street executives, but his overall argument about inaction by federal officials is flat-out wrong.

We rate the statement False.

Rush Holt says the U.S. had more than twice as much debt in 1944 as it does now
","
Today’s federal debt pales in comparison to what the government owed during World War II, according to U.S. Rep. Rush Holt.

The congressman said in a recent telephone town hall meeting that despite facing mounds of debt in 1944, the United States made major investments in education. Yet now, lawmakers are talking about cutting federal aid for education when the nation’s debt is half of what it was 67 years ago, he claimed.

""In 1944, this country was in debt like we had never been before or have been since. I'll repeat that. We were in debt more than twice as much as we are now,"" Holt (D-12th Dist.) said on Dec. 6.

The U.S. had more than twice as much debt in 1944 as it does now? Not by any measure.

The problem is Holt said debt, when his spokesman said he meant deficit.

Here’s the difference between the two:

Deficit is the shortfall in a year. If the government spends more than it takes in, the difference is the deficit.

Debt is what the government owes from the accumulation of past deficits and surpluses.

After many years of spending beyond its means, the federal government’s gross debt is more than $15 trillion. That figure includes debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings, essentially money the government owes itself.

Some economists prefer to focus on debt held by the public, since it is what the government has borrowed from outside entities. We’ll compare how both measures of debt have fared between 1944 and now.

At the end of fiscal year 1944, as the U.S. was embroiled in World War II, total debt stood at more than $204 billion. Nearly $185 billion of that was held by the public, according to data from the White House Office of Management and Budget. As a percentage of gross domestic product, a yardstick of a nation’s economy, the total debt in 1944 was 97.6 percent and debt held by the public was 88.3 percent.

As of Dec. 13, the nation’s total debt amounted to more than $15 trillion, of which nearly $10.4 trillion is publicly held. By the most recent data released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, that debt represents more than 99.2 percent of gross domestic product and nearly 68.5 percent of gross domestic product, respectively.

So, by those measures, Holt’s claim is off.

Thomas Seay, a spokesman for Holt, said the statement was ""intended as a reference to the annual U.S. budget deficit as a percentage of GDP – that is, to how quickly America was falling into debt.""

In 1944, the deficit measured up to 22.7 percent of the nation’s economy, according to the Office of Management and Budget. In fiscal year 2011, the deficit was 8.7 percent of gross domestic product, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Still, as Gerald Lynch, a professor of economics at Purdue University, noted in an email, ""If the congressman wanted to say we were racking up debt then at a rate twice what we are today, then that would be ok to refer to the deficit to gdp ratio. To say that we were in twice as much debt is not correct.""

Our ruling

Holt claimed that in 1944 ""we were in debt more than twice as much as we are now.""

By any measure of the debt, the congressman’s statement is wrong. A spokesman said Holt meant to talk about the deficit but he used the word debt..

We rate the statement False.
