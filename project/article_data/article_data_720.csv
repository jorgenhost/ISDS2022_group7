Devils Tower is a rock formation, despite wrong, recycled claims on social media
","Devils Tower — 1,267 feet of rock rising above the Belle Fourche River in Wyoming — is the first national monument, designated by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906. It’s also a sacred place for Native American tribes, and geologists have studied its formation since the late 1800s. But a Facebook post claims there’s been a new discovery that ""will change history.""  ""Scientists from the Wyoming State Parks Department were conducting photographic seismic readings below the tower when they discovered an incredibly large petrified root system below the tower,"" the post says. ""The parks department released a statement saying, ‘We have discovered what looks like a giant root system stemming from the base of the Devils Tower. The root system has been measured at 4 miles deep by 7 miles wide. We are currently conducting studies and tests to confirm that this is actually a root system and not a coincidence’."" It’s not a coincidence, and this claim is also ""completely false,"" according to a spokesperson for Wyoming state parks. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The false information originated on a satire site, said Gary Schoene, public information office manager for Wyoming State Parks, Historic Sites & Trails. The department has released no statement about a possible root system. Plus, Schoene said, because Devils Tower is a national monument, it’s part of the National Park Service system — not the state parks system.  Geologists still wonder how the tower formed, but do know it’s formed of a rare igneous rock called phonolite porphyry, according to the National Park Service website. Geologists agree that the tower started as magma, but there’s no consensus on how exactly the magma cooled to form the tower, according to the site. The information in the Facebook post is fake, and it’s also not new. Snopes debunked it back in 2017, after a Facebook page that posts satire published the claims.

No evidence of ‘graphene oxide’ that’s ‘toxic’ in Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine
","An Instagram post with an incendiary video that speaks of  murder claims that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine is dangerously packed with something called graphene oxide.

Dr. Rebecca Wurtz, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Minnesota, said none of the ingredients in the list Pfizer provides to caregivers and patients for its COVID-19 vaccine show graphene oxide. None of the listed ingredients is another name for graphene oxide. Graphene oxide does not appear in a list of ingredients published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines.  All three are recommended by public health experts, because they are highly effective at preventing COVID-19 infection and reduce the risk of severe illness, hospitalization and death from the disease.

More than 182 million Americans (55% of the population) have received at least one dose so far, with minimal complications reported despite the massive sample size. A study published in May by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that graphene oxide nanoparticles would be effective in a flu vaccine, but that more study was needed to determine safety.

A post challenging COVID-19 vaccine safety takes drug makers’ records out of context
","An image on Instagram takes aim at four pharmaceutical companies’ records to imply that their COVID-19 vaccines are unsafe. The headline on the post is ""Choosing your COVID-19 vaccine — facts you need to know."" Below, in a table with the company logos, are claims that one manufacturer faced $4.7 billion in fines; one had never brought a vaccine to market; one was sued hundreds of thousands of times for dangerous products; and the fourth had its vaccine ""suspended"" by European countries for ""lethal"" adverse health effects. The sarcastic ender: ""Don’t worry, you’re in safe hands!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The individual statements about the manufacturers’ records are based on facts, according to news and research reports. But in trying to draw a connection between these statements and the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines, the post leaves out context about research that has shown the vaccines to be safe and effective. ""Pfizer: $4.7 billion in fines for false claims, drug and medical equipment safety violations, off-label promotion, corrupt practices, kickbacks and bribery."" From 1991 through 2017, Pfizer paid $4.7 billion in financial penalties in settlements with federal and state agencies, according to a 2018 report about the pharmaceutical industry from Public Citizen, a government watchdog. That included $2.3 billion in 2009 for unlawful promotion of several drugs and kickbacks to prescribing physicians. ""Moderna: Has never brought a vaccine to market since its founding."" Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine is the company’s first to be authorized. The company was founded in 2010 to develop medicines based on messenger RNA and has worked with other pharmaceutical companies and research bodies on personalized cancer vaccines and other types of vaccine programs. ""Johnson & Johnson: ""Named in hundreds of thousands of lawsuits for toxic and/or dangerous products, including drugs."" Among the lawsuits: 25,000 over its blood thinner Xarelto; 25,000 over pelvic mesh; and 14,000 over its talc-based baby powder, according to a 2019 news article by The Guardian. A 2019 Bloomberg report said the company faced at least 100,000 cases over those products and others. ""AstraZeneca: Suspended by two dozen European countries due to severe, lethal adverse reactions, like blood clots."" In March 2021, some two dozen countries suspended use of the company’s COVID-19 vaccine as a precaution over reports of  dangerous blood clots in some recipients. The suspensions were lifted within weeks. The Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines have received federal emergency authorization for use in the U.S. and have produced strong safety records. (The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines require two doses for full vaccination, the Johnson & Johnson is a one-dose vaccine.) More than 331 million doses of all three vaccines have been given in the United States, according to the CDC. More than 182 million Americans (55% of the population) have received at least one dose so far, with minimal complications reported despite the massive sample size. The federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System has received 5,718 reports of death (0.0018%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. Those reports on their own do not establish whether a death was caused by the vaccine. ""A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines,"" the CDC said. Two serious, but rare types of health problems have been found to occur in vaccinated people, the CDC says. They are anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) and, after vaccination with Johnson & Johnson vaccine,thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (blood clots).  The blood clot condition occurs in about seven per 1 million vaccinated women between 18 and 49 years old. The CDC in early May recommended resuming the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after a brief pause to study the blood-clot cases, and said it would continue monitoring the reports. The CDC is also monitoring reports of myocarditis and pericarditis (heart inflammation), primarily in adolescents and young adults who received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. The AstraZeneca vaccine is not authorized for use in the U.S. After the vaccine was suspended in many European countries pending an inquiry into blood-clot cases, European regulators declared March 18 that it is safe and effective. A month later, they reaffirmed their recommendation to use the vaccine, calling the clot cases ""very rare.""  Meanwhile, reports continue to come in that many to most COVID-19 deaths in the United States are occurring among unvaccinated people. An Instagram post makes statements about the records of four pharmaceutical companies to imply that the COVID-19 vaccines they make are unsafe. The individual statements accurately reflect the companies’ track records, though in some cases, they don’t relate to the companies’ COVID-19 vaccines.  In presenting these statements as a basis for judging the safety of their COVID-19 vaccines, the post leaves out important context about the companies' broader safety record and research studies and real-world experience that have shown the vaccines to be safe and effective.

Fact-checking a post about racial disparities in sentencing
","A post being shared on Instagram points to racial disparities in the criminal justice system by claiming that white former police officers convicted of killing Black people received significantly shorter prison sentences than a Black man convicted of selling marijuana. The June 27 post is a collage that shows unidentified mugshots of four people, labeled with a brief description of the crime they committed and the prison sentences they received. Another version of the post on Instagram includes their names.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook. The labels on each photo provide little information about the circumstances of the crimes, and in the case of the marijuana conviction, the post leaves out significant context about the charges surrounding the sentence. One of the mugshots is of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was sentenced June 25 to 22½ years in prison for the 2020 murder of George Floyd. Chauvin was found guilty of two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter; he was filmed kneeling on Floyd's neck for nine minutes. Prosecutors had sought a 30-year sentence. Another mugshot is of former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke, with the post saying he received six years in prison for murdering a Black boy. Van Dyke was sentenced in 2019 to nearly seven years in prison after being found guilty of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery in the 2014 death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. Van Dyke shot McDonald 16 times after the teen walked away from an encounter with police officers, according to the Associated Press. Van Dyke arrived on scene after other officers had stopped McDonald and, within seconds, fired his weapon. Prosecutors had sought an 18- to 20-year prison sentence for Van Dyke. The third mugshot is of former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, who was sentenced by a jury to 10 years in prison in 2019, for the murder of 26-year-old Botham Jean. Guyger was off duty when she entered Jean's apartment thinking it was her own and mistook Jean for a home invader, according to The New York Times. She pulled out her service weapon and fatally shot Jean. Prosecutors had sought a 28-year prison sentence. The fourth mugshot is of Michael Thompson, a Black man, who was sentenced to up to 60 years in prison after being convicted of selling 3 pounds of marijuana in Michigan to a police informant in 1994. After his initial arrest, police searched his home and found 14 weapons, some of which were antiques and kept in a gun safe, according to CNN. Although most of the guns belonged to his wife, Thompson did own some of the firearms and had prior drug convictions. Under Michigan's habitual-offender law, a judge added sentencing enhancements to extend Thompson’s prison term, CNN reported. Because of the past convictions, he was sentenced in 1996 to up to 15 years for the drug charges and 40 to 60 years for firearms possession by a felon. Thompson spent more than two decades in prison and was released in December when Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer granted him and three other people clemency and commuted their sentences. The circumstances of the four cases and the sentences vary in ways that complicate direct comparisons. But racial disparities have long existed in the United States’ criminal justice system. A study by the Council on Criminal Justice, a prison reform think tank, found that disparities between Black and white people in the U.S. prison, jail, probation and parole populations shrank between 2000 and 2016. However, Black people were still five times more likely to be imprisoned for drug offenses and three times more likely to be jailed for property crimes as white people who committed similar offenses. A separate report by the American Civil Liberties Union in 2014 found Black men were given nearly 20% longer sentences than white men convicted of similar crimes. ""The racial disparities increase with the severity of the sentence imposed,"" the ACLU wrote. States that allowed sentencing enhancements under a three-strikes or habitual-offender law were more likely to use them on Black men than white men convicted of similar crimes and with similar criminal backgrounds, the organization found. An Instagram post claims the combined prison sentences of three white, former police officers convicted of murder were significantly less than what a Black man received after being convicted for selling marijuana. Thompson, a Black man, was sentenced to up to 60 years for firearms possession by a felon. The sentence for the drug charge was up to 15 years. He served more than 20 years in prison before his sentence was commuted in 2020. Meanwhile, the three white former police officers were given shorter prison sentences than prosecutors sought for their murder convictions. Their combined prison sentences were for 38.5 years.  The claim is partly accurate but leaves out significant context about the charges surrounding Thompson’s sentence.

A post about Pelosi’s and Trump’s wealth gains while in office makes flawed comparison
","During their time in public office, did House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pile up massive wealth while former President Donald Trump added none? That’s the claim of an Instagram post that compares the California Democrat to her one-time political nemesis. It states: ""President Trump's net gain while in office $0, Nancy Pelosi's net gain while in office $191 million."" The implication is that Pelosi has enriched herself as a public servant. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post isn’t specific about what it means by ""net gain."" We took it to mean gain in net worth, which is a measure of a person’s assets minus liabilities. In that sense, Pelosi and her husband have gained considerably more than Trump, even though Trump’s wealth is estimated to be much larger than Pelosi’s. It’s accurate to say Trump had no gain in net worth during his time in office. In fact, estimates are that his net worth dropped by as much as $1.1 billion.  Pelosi is one Congress’ richest members, and her financial disclosures show household assets between $57 million and $271 million, mostly her husband’s holdings. But the claim about her wealth gain isn’t supported. There’s not enough information in her public disclosures to show what her net worth is or how much it grew during her time in the House. By one way of estimating it, the gain would be closer to $100 million than $191 million. The comparison also leaves out an important element of context: Time. Trump spent four years in office, a period that saw a pandemic-related crash in the hospitality and commercial real-estate industries, the source of much of his wealth. Pelosi has been a member of Congress for 34 years, a period during which the size of the U.S. economy more than doubled, the stock market grew more than 1,500%, and property values around Pelosi’s hometown of San Francisco skyrocketed in tandem with the rise of Silicon Valley and the Internet. As of July 7, Forbes put Trump’s net worth at $2.4 billion, ranking him No. 1,299 on its list of billionaires, mainly from New York City real estate. That was down $1.1 billion from the magazine’s estimate of $3.5 billion when he took office in January 2017.  Among the reasons for the decline, Forbes cited a $217 million decrease in the value of a commercial building in midtown Manhattan that briefly went vacant. Bloomberg’s estimates are smaller, but similar. It estimated that as Trump left office, his net worth was $2.3 billion, down from $3 billion. Bloomberg cited, among other factors, COVID-19’s impact on office buildings, and on the hotels and resorts that bear Trump’s name. Trump’s January 2021 financial disclosure showed the Trump Organization’s 2020 revenue was down nearly 38% from a year earlier. Pelosi joined the House of Representatives, representing a San Francisco district, in 1987. Most of her fortune stems from the investments of her husband, Paul Pelosi, a prominent businessman active in real estate and venture capital for decades.  The estimates of her wealth come from financial disclosure forms that all members of Congress must file. But only a range of values, rather than specific dollar amounts, must be reported. Pelosi’s latest annual financial disclosure report, for 2020, was due on May 15, 2021. But she requested an extension, so it’s due Aug. 13. The latest available disclosure is Pelosi’s 2019 report.  The assets listed in the report include a home and checking accounts jointly owned by the couple, plus Paul Pelosi’s investments including commercial real estate and shares of blue-chip stocks such as Apple, Facebook, Visa and Walt Disney Co.  The listed assets totaled between $57 million and $271 million, and their liabilities were between $20 million and $97 million. So, Pelosi’s net worth as of 2019 could have been as high as $251 million — using the maximum possible value of her assets and the minimum possible amount of her liabilities. Or, doing the reverse, it could be as low as negative $40 million.  Taking the midpoints — $164 million in assets minus $58.5 million in liabilities — would put Pelosi’s 2019 net worth at $105.5 million. Pelosi’s 1987 disclosure form shows her assets were at least $3.64 million. Her liabilities were at least $965,000, but because of the way reporting was done then, the top end of the range is not clear. As a result, there isn’t evidence in these filings to establish that her gain was $191 million. An Instagram post claimed that Trump's ""net gain while in office"" was zero, while Pelosi's net gain while in office has been $191 million, suggesting that Pelosi enriched herself as a public servant The comparison leaves out key context on several fronts. One is the two leaders’ length of service. Pelosi’s tenure in office is more than three decades longer than Trump’s was. Also, much of her wealth is from her husband’s investments. Estimates show Trump’s net worth shrank by as much as $1.1 billion during his four years as president. Financial disclosures don’t provide enough information to show how much Pelosi’s net worth is, or how much it has grown since she took office in 1987. One way of estimating it puts the gain at about $100 million.  The post is partly accurate but leaves out important context and lacks evidence for part of its claim.

Data showing lower death rate for coronavirus delta variant doesn’t mean it’s less dangerous
","The delta variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has been found to be far more infectious than the original coronavirus. An Instagram post claimed it’s far less lethal. ""Fear in perpetuity,"" the post said. ""Delta variant is approximately 19 times less deadly than the already massively inflated death numbers we got for China virus part 1. Mainstream media about to tell you otherwise 24/7."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Experts say there’s not enough data yet to determine whether the delta variant is less dangerous than earlier variants.  Even as COVID-19 cases are on the decline and Americans resume much of normal life, new mutations of the virus are raising concern, particularly the delta. That variant, first identified in India in December, swept through Britain, and the first U.S. case was identified in March, according to the Yale School of Medicine.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts the delta variant will soon account for 45% of infections in a large group of states that span from Missouri to Montana. The Instagram post includes a portion of Table 2 from a June 25 technical report on coronavirus variants by Public Health England, a government agency. The table indicates the case fatality rate is 0.1% for delta, compared with 1.9% for the original alpha variant — or 1/19th the rate. That’s how the post arrives at the conclusion that delta is ""19 times less deadly."" Public Health England spokesperson James McCreadie told PolitiFact the post ""is factually incorrect and manipulates our data."" McCreadie told us on July 5 that as of June 21, 117 people in England had died with the delta variant, including 44 who were unvaccinated. ""Many factors contribute to death, including age, comorbidities and deprivation. It is too early to assess the case fatality ratio compared to other variants,"" he said. Experts pointed out that lower case fatality rates would be expected, simply because so many people have been vaccinated in recent months, whereas the original coronavirus had time to spread and cause severe disease long before vaccines became widely available.  The vaccines authorized in the U.S. and the U.K. have been shown to substantially reduce the likelihood of getting infected with COVID-19, and to reduce the severity of the disease in those who do get infected. Boston University professor Brooke Nichols, a health economist and infectious-disease mathematical modeler, noted that Table 4 of the same report shows that most people aged 50 and over who have been confirmed to be infected with the delta variant have had one or two doses of the vaccine.  ""The reported case fatality rate from Table 2 in the report is really just illustrative of the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing severe disease,"" she said. Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said: ""All variants are going to have a lower case fatality rate, because a significant portion of the population, especially those at high risk for death, are fully or partially vaccinated."" The delta virus was ""tamer because of the high proportion of high-risk people that were protected by a combination of vaccination and prior immunity,"" he added. ""Also, treatments have improved."" An Instagram post claimed that the delta variant of the coronavirus ""is approximately 19 times less deadly."" A government report from England indicates that the fatality rate for the delta variant there is 0.1%, compared with 1.9% for the original coronavirus. The difference is a factor of 19.

Fauci’s ‘two Americas’ comment on COVID-19 vaccination rates taken out of context

""Fauci says there will be 'two Americas': One for vaccinated, one for unvaccinated,"" said one June 30 Instagram post liked thousands of times, which shows a screenshot of a tweet.  ""Why isn’t this clown in jail?"" the Instagram user added in a caption. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The comment in question came when Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser on COVID-19, appeared on CNN June 29. The full transcript of his interview with CNN’s Don Lemon shows that he was responding to a question about the more infectious delta variant of the coronavirus. Lemon asked about the possibility that the variant could drive new outbreaks in the states that have administered the fewest COVID-19 vaccines. In response, Fauci said he is concerned those states will be hit harder than states with higher vaccination uptakes.   Here’s the full exchange, in context and with Fauci’s ""two Americas"" remark in bold: Lemon: ""The president had wanted 70% of people to have some degree of vaccination, right, a first or second dose. So my question is, the U.S., we're going to fall short of President Biden's goal of vaccinating 70% of adults with at least one dose by July 4, largely because of states like Alabama, Arkansas, my home state of Louisiana, Mississippi, Wyoming. They have less than 35% of the population fully vaccinated. The former FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, is concerned that there will be very dense outbreaks in these areas. What do you think, Dr. Fauci?"" Fauci: ""I agree with Dr. Gottlieb. That is something that we are very concerned about. When you have such a low level of vaccination superimposed upon a variant that has a high degree of efficiency of spread, what you are going to see among undervaccinated regions — be they states, cities or counties — you are going to see these individual types of blips. It's almost like it's going to be two Americas. You're going to have areas where the vaccine rate is high, where more than 70% of the population has received at least one dose. When you compare that with areas where you may have 35% of the people vaccinated, you clearly have a high risk of seeing these spikes in those selected areas. The thing that's so frustrating about this, Don, is that this is entirely avoidable, entirely preventable. If you are vaccinated, you diminish dramatically your risk of getting infected, and even more dramatically your risk of getting seriously ill. If you are not vaccinated, you are at considerable risk."" As of July 4, 55% of the U.S. population had gotten at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 47% was fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Among adults, 67% had received one dose and 58% were fully vaccinated. Some states are far behind others when it comes to vaccination rates, however. Mississippi, for example, has fully vaccinated about 38% of adults, according to the New York Times. Some other states like Vermont and Massachusetts have over 70% of residents fully vaccinated. In a recent poll conducted by the Washington Post and ABC News, 74% of people who have not been vaccinated said they definitely or probably won’t get a shot. An Instagram post said, ""Fauci says there will be ‘two Americas’: One for vaccinated; one for unvaccinated."" The post shows a screenshot of a tweet and is based on comments Fauci made in an interview with CNN. But the full context shows that Fauci was answering a question about state vaccination disparities, and predicting that some of the states with low rates could experience more serious case outbreaks due to the delta variant.

False post about Sha’Carri Richardson’s replacement at Olympics came from joke account
","Sha’Carri Richardson, the American sprinter who was a favorite to win gold in the women’s 100 meters at the Tokyo Olympics, was suspended for a month from the U.S. Olympic team after testing positive for marijuana.  Richardson said that she had used marijuana to cope with the unexpected death of her biological mother.

No, Iowa’s ‘Back the Blue Act’ does not criminalize wearing the image of the U.S. flag
","After Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a bill on June 17 that creates harsher penalties for protestors into law, Greg Hauenstein – a political and commercial photographer – took to Twitter to critique a part of the law outlining punishment for showing disrespect to the United States flag.  ""Under the ‘Back the Blue’ Act that @KimReynoldsIA signed today you cannot ‘intentionally cut up or alter’ or ‘intentionally make physically unclean’ an American flag,"" Hauenstein tweeted. ""So throw out those towels and swimsuits, ladies and germs or you’re a criminal!""  Were the people sporting the American flag on articles of clothing this Fourth of July weekend committing a simple misdemeanor under Iowa’s law? We decided to look into it.  In Senate File 342, also known as the ""Back the Blue Act,"" Section 46 amends Iowa Code 2021 with a list of actions defined as a simple misdemeanor. The sixth item on the list states that someone commits a simple misdemeanor if they ""knowingly and publicly use the flag of the United States in such a manner as to show disrespect for the flag as a symbol of the United States, with the intent or reasonable expectation that such use will provoke or encourage another to commit trespass or assault."" The subsection defines showing disrespect as defacing, defiling, mutilating, or trampling the flag, which Hauenstein’s tweet implied would include the process of making and wearing the image of the flag.  However, the subsection defines flag as ""a piece of woven cloth or other material designed to be flown from a pole or mast.""  A previous fact check found that the thin blue line flag does not violate the U.S. Flag Code because it does not fit the definition of a U.S. flag. The image of the American flag on clothing does not meet SF 342’s definition of a flag, and therefore the defacing, defiling, mutilating, or trampling of that clothing does not qualify as a simple misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of a fine ranging from $105 to $855. The court also may order a maximum of 30 days in jail, according to Iowa Code.  Craig Robinson, the founder and editor-in-chief of The Iowa Republican, responded to Hauenstein’s tweet, pointing out that towels and swimsuits aren’t made of actual American flags, to which Hauenstein responded he was being facetious.  ""I was being facetious, that’s just my style,"" he confirmed in a conversation with PolitiFact Iowa.  Whether the Iowa law withstands constitutional challenges is another question.  Gene Policinski, chief operating officer and senior fellow for the First Amendment of the Freedom Forum Institute, said acts that would be considered a simple misdemeanor under SF 342 are protected by the First Amendment. In the 1989 Supreme Court case Texas v. Johnson, justices ruled 5-4 that flag burning constitutes symbolic speech protected under the First Amendment.   ""I think the fundamental philosophy of these laws isn’t there,"" Policinski said. ""They’re certainly at odds with court decisions; they are impractical to enforce."" The ""Back the Blue Act"" creates punishment for showing disrespect for the U.S. flag, but the image of the flag on clothing or other fabric that is not used to make the flag does not qualify as a flag under Iowa law.  Additionally, desecration of the flag is protected under the First Amendment, according to the 1989 Supreme Court case Texas v. Johnson. Hauenstein said that he was being facetious in his critique of the new Iowa law.  We rate the claim in the tweet to be False. ",/factchecks/2021/jul/06/greg-hauenstein/no-iowas-back-blue-act-does-not-criminalize-wearin/

Déjà vu all over again as former President Trump wrongly claims Wisconsin victory
","As the Wisconsin Republican Party gathered for its annual convention to plot strategy for the future, former President Donald Trump continued his effort to re-fight the last election. First, he claimed state GOP leaders were ""working hard to cover up election corruption in Wisconsin"" and to block an investigation into the 2020 results. We rated that Pants on Fire. Those leaders, to be sure, are spearheading such an effort. More predictably, in a video statement shown June 26, 2021 to convention delegates, Trump repeated this familiar claim:  ""We had actually great results in Wisconsin, as you know in 2016 we won and as you also know in 2020 we won,"" the former president said.  If Trump wants re-litigate the claim that he won in 2020, we can revisit it, too.  Hint: His claim is still ridiculously false. Trump has made his ""I won Wisconsin"" claim numerous times, perhaps most prominently at a Dec. 5, 2020 rally in Valdosta, Ga., where he tried to boost the campaigns of Republican U.S. Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. Two Democrats, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, ultimately won those races, putting the Senate at a 50-50 tie, and effectively in Democratic control. At the Georgia rally, Trump spent time trashing Wisconsin, one of the state’s that narrowly swung to Democrat Joe Biden, and declared: ""Actually, I won Wisconsin."" We rated the claim Pants on Fire. Some excerpts from that item: ""On Nov. 4, 2020, the morning after Election Day, the Associated Press declared Biden the winner in Wisconsin. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported unofficial results showed Biden with a lead of about 20,000 votes -- and that the Trump campaign was already vowing to request a recount. ""When it did request the recount, Trump’s team focused only on heavily Democratic Dane and Milwaukee counties. But, by the time the recount was over, Trump actually fell further behind."" Also:  ""Having failed, the Trump campaign turned to the court system. ""But on Dec. 3, 2020, in a 4-3 decision, the state Supreme Court rejected the campaign’s request to overturn the certification of votes. Instead, the court said Trump’s campaign had to start at the circuit court level. It was a major setback, with even dissenting judges indicating they may reject the call to throw out hundreds of thousands of ballots. ""A day later, the court said it would not accept a lawsuit by Trump allies who wanted to let Republican lawmakers decide how to cast the state's electoral votes, rather than the electors chosen by voters in the election.  ""Meanwhile, the campaign also went to the federal court, where U.S. District Judge Brett Ludwig questioned whether the case should even be before him, calling part of the lawsuit’s requested remedy ‘really bizarre’ and told an attorney for the Trump campaign it was seeking  ‘pretty remarkable declaratory relief.’ Ludwig has scheduled a hearing for Dec. 10."" In the end, that effort failed as well -- as did numerous other court challenges to the results.  Beyond that, there has been no evidence presented that suggests widespread fraud -- enough to overturn the election -- took place.  Trump’s claim that he won Wisconsin in 2020 was ridiculous when he first made it. If anything, to keep repeating it is more ridiculous now. Pants on Fire.  ",/factchecks/2021/jul/06/donald-trump/deja-vu-all-over-again-former-president-trump-wron/

Hillary Clinton correctly claims that Trump Tower was in part built by undocumented workers
","Seeking to portray Donald Trump as a hypocrite on immigration, Hillary Clinton claimed during the third presidential debate that the billionaire candidate used undocumented workers to build his New York City skyscraper. In a jab at Trump, Clinton said her immigration plan would bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows and protect them from employers like Trump taking advantage of them. ""And Donald knows a lot about this,"" she said. ""He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ‘You complain, I'll get you deported.’ "" This line of attack is similar to one used by one of Trump’s primary rivals, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who in February accused him of hiring ""illegal"" Polish workers on a construction project decades ago. We rated Rubio’s claim Half True because he attributed more blame to Trump and mentioned a separate issue of a legal settlement. There’s also more evidence now to support Clinton’s simpler statement. Between 1979 and 1980, Trump hired a contractor to demolish a Manhattan building to make way for the eventual Trump Tower. That contractor in turn hired local union workers as well as 200 undocumented Polish workers to meet the tight deadlines. Media reports indicated that the Polish employees were paid off the books, working 12-hour shifts every day for only $4 to $5 an hour without overtime pay. Time magazine reported that Trump allegedly sought out the workers after seeing them on another construction job, and then threatened through his lawyer to contact immigration services during a dispute over unpaid wages. In 1983, union members hired to work on the project sued Trump, a union boss and the contractor for using the undocumented Polish workers to undercut their pensions and welfare funds. The future Republican presidential candidate appeared in court in 1990 and denied knowing that the workers weren’t in the country legally, but a Manhattan judge ended up ruling against Trump and ordered him to pay the workers more than $325,000. Trump appealed the case, which dragged on for another decade, before quietly settling out of court in 1999. The Republican candidate’s alleged use of undocumented workers has continued even into the current presidential campaign. Several construction workers interviewed by the Washington Post in July 2015 said they were hired to help renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington despite residing in the country illegally. A Trump spokeswoman at the time said his business and contractors followed all applicable immigration laws. Our ruling Clinton claimed that Trump ""used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower."" There’s no question that undocumented workers were hired to do demolition work on the future site of Trump Tower. Questions remain as to how involved Trump was in the construction process and hiring of the 200 Polish laborers, but Clinton is factually correct to say that undocumented labor helped construct Trump’s New York skyscraper.

Trump wrongly says $6 billion went missing at State Department under Clinton
","At the third and final presidential debate, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton’s State Department lost $6 billion, and that the money might have been stolen. ""The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary. You don't,"" Trump said in Las Vegas Oct. 19. ""Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen — they don't know. It's gone, $6 billion. If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess. Believe me."" Clinton responded, ""Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times."" In fact, the claim that the State Department lost $6 billion, or that it was stolen, has been debunked. Including by us. Trump’s inaccurate claim stems from a misreading of a March 2014 alert out of the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General. The alert found that paperwork for various contracts was mismanaged. These contracts were together worth about $6 billion. The money didn’t go missing; the paperwork did. The State Department Inspector General sent out an alert that summarized previous audits, which found that paperwork for over $6 billion worth of contracts from 2008 to 2014 ""were incomplete or could not be located at all."" The period of the audits included time before Clinton became secretary of state. A spokesman for the Office of the Inspector General told PolitiFact previously the alert speaks for itself, but many seemed to misinterpret what it actually said. The confusion prompted Inspector General Steve Linick to pen a clarification in the Washington Post. ""Some have concluded based on this that $6 billion is missing. The alert, however, did not draw that conclusion,"" he wrote. ""Instead, it found that the failure to adequately maintain contract files — documents necessary to ensure the full accounting of U.S. tax dollars — ‘creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the department’s contract actions.’ "" In other words, the State Department was terrible at paperwork. The $6 billion figure refers to the total amount affected by file mismanagement. It’s akin to failing to get a receipt for your $20 lunch. Documentation over where that $20 went is gone, but not the $20 itself. For example, the inspector general alert notes that an audit of the Bureau of African Affairs found that the office was unable to provide full administrative files for eight separate contracts, valued at a combined $34.8 million. So the State Department under Clinton may have been financially disorganized and, according to the alert, opening itself up to fraud. But it didn’t ""lose"" $6 billion. Nor was there any suggestion it was ""stolen."" Our ruling Trump said that when Clinton ""ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen — they don't know."" The $6 billion figure comes from a State Department inspector general report that found paperwork for various contracts had been mismanaged. The $6 billion was not missing or stolen — it had been doled out in a number of contracts — but the paperwork was missing. We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5513387c-9761-413a-abbd-a5d048e1f79c Correction: The alert summarized previous audits of State Department contracts.

Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton fought for a wall between U.S., Mexico
","When the topic turned to immigration in the Oct. 19, 2016, presidential debate, Donald Trump suggested that Hillary Clinton supported his signature proposal: a massive wall on the U.S-Mexico border. ""Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. Hillary Clinton fought for the wall, in 2006 or thereabouts,"" he said. ""Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn’t built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall."" Clinton, alluding to her time as a U.S. senator from New York, responded by saying she voted for border security, which she said included a wall in ""some limited"" places but also measures such as new technology. So, did Clinton support the type of wall Trump wants? Wall to wall PolitiFact National has examined how Trump plans to build, and pay for, the wall. Trump has said the wall could cost $8 billion to $12 billion, be made of precast concrete, and rise 35 to 40 feet, or 50 feet, or higher. He’s said the wall doesn’t need to run the nearly 2,000 miles of the border, but about 1,000 miles because of natural barriers. As Trump suggested in the debate, Clinton did vote for a barrier. But it was not to the extent he supports. As we previously reported, the Trump campaign cited Clinton’s vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, signed into law by President George W. Bush, which authorized about 700 miles of fencing to be installed along the country’s southern border, along with other security measures. It was the beginning of an attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform.

So it’s fair to say Clinton supported a barrier. For our purposes, the differences between a wall and a fence in this claim are not significant — both block people.

But the fence Clinton backed is not as extensive as the wall Trump is promoting. And in his phrasing, Trump equated the two. The Associated Press has reported that the fencing, placed largely in urban areas, is not the type of solid wall that Trump has pledged to construct at Mexico’s expense. The fence has miles-long gaps and gates built in to allow landowners access to their property on the south side of the fencing. Immigrants have been known to go over and around the fence. Indeed, Trump himself has said the fencing ""was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall."" Our rating Trump said, Clinton ""wanted the wall."" Clinton voted in 2006 for 700 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, but not for the taller, longer concrete wall that he vows to build. The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate his statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/95d8bd7c-eee9-4f37-a7c9-e003d18a8316",/factchecks/2016/oct/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-fought-wall-betw/

Donald Trump off-base in saying Hillary Clinton will 'double your taxes'
","One of the planned topics for the third presidential debate in Las Vegas was the economy, so tax policy came up in the face-off between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. At one point, Trump said of Clinton’s tax proposal, ""Her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes."" Is that correct? Independent experts who have modeled the candidates’ tax proposals said that would be the exception rather than the rule. First, a quick summary of Clinton’s tax plan, which includes tax increases for the wealthy. Clinton proposes a 4 percent surcharge on income earned in excess of $5 million as well as a minimum tax rate of 30 percent for those earning more than $1 million. She would also limit certain exemptions and deductions to 28 percent; she would tax carried interest, a type of income typically earned by hedge fund managers, as ordinary income; and she would permanently reduce the tax threshold for estates to $3.5 million, or $7 million for married couples, while increasing the top estate tax rate to 45 percent. The general impact of these changes will be to raise taxes on the richest Americans. An analysis by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center concluded that ""in 2017, taxpayers in the top 1 percent of the income distribution -- those with incomes above $730,000 in 2015 dollars -- would see their tax burdens increase more than $78,000."" However, taxpayers in the bottom 95 percent of the income spectrum -- those earning less than $300,000 -- ""would see little change in average after-tax income,"" the Tax Policy Center found. The Tax Foundation, which generally favors lower taxes, broadly concurred in its own analysis. Without accounting for the plan’s impact on the broader economy, ""Clinton’s tax plan would raise taxes on the top 20 percent of taxpayers and cut taxes for taxpayers in all other income quintiles,"" the foundation’s analysis said. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung told PolitiFact that ""Clinton will double tax rates on short-term capital gains."" The campaign pointed to an article from Fox Business that explained Clinton’s proposal to levy higher taxes on investments held for a short period of time than on investments held for longer periods. ""Under Clinton’s proposal, investments held between one and two years would be taxed at the normal income-tax rate of 39.6 percent, nearly double the existing 20 percent capital gains rate,"" the article said. However, Trump said ""your taxes,"" suggesting that lots of Americans would be hit by Clinton’s tax increases. That’s a stretch, since, as noted in the Fox Business article the Trump camp pointed to, ""only the top 0.5 percent of taxpayers would be impacted by the plan."" We asked representatives of both groups whether they thought Trump’s comment was broadly accurate. ""It may be possible to find a very specific case where this is true, but her plan would only raise taxes modestly and would actually cut taxes for many people,"" said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation. Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said that if you parse his group’s analysis, it shows that, on average, the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers would see their effective tax rate go up from 34.4 percent to 41.5 percent -- almost a 21 percent increase. That’s a significant bump, but it’s far from double. Meanwhile, the bottom 80 percent would see tax cuts, he said, while those in the 80th to 95th percentiles would get small tax increases, on the order of about 0.1 percent, Williams said. ""I suppose some cases could be imagined where taxes would rise a lot,"" Williams said. ""Perhaps a person who has carried interest could see their tax rate go from the 23.8 percent top capital gains rate to a 47.4 percent marginal tax rate on income in excess of $5 million. With enough of that type of income, that person's taxes would go up a lot."" Also, Clinton’s proposed minimum tax rate of 30 percent for those earning more than $1 million -- commonly known as the Buffett Rule -- could conceivably double taxation for people who are lucky enough to be paying a rate under 15 percent today, he said. (The Buffett Rule is named after Warren Buffett, who has criticized the fact that he is often taxed at a lower rate than his secretary.) But both of those scenarios are ""very rare"" cases, Williams said. Our ruling Trump said that Clinton’s tax proposal ""is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes."" Independent analyses found that the vast majority of taxpayers would see tax cuts or no change to their tax bill under the Clinton plan. The richest taxpayers would see increases -- and the very richest could see significant increases -- but even the typical rich taxpayer would not see their taxes double. Analysts said it’s possible that specific wealthy taxpayers with a certain confluence of income streams might see their taxes double, but that would be the exception that proves the rule. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/67b81a1f-6064-4072-a9af-b6ee7c595bbd",/factchecks/2016/oct/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-predicts-hillary-clinton-will-double-/

Hillary Clinton blames high-up Russians for WikiLeaks releases
","Editor's note: We've attached an update to this fact-check below in response to reader queries after subsequent testimony by James Clapper. The original fact-check and rating remain unchanged. In one of the most heated moments of the final presidential debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed over Russia’s interference in the current election. Speaking of the WikiLeaks’ release of tens of thousands of emails from the Clinton campaign and, earlier, the Democratic National Committee, Trump said Clinton had no idea who hacked and released the emails — ""Russia, China or anybody else."" Clinton responded by asking Trump if he really doesn’t believe the 17 federal intelligence agencies that have said Russia is behind the cyberattack. ""We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,"" Clinton said. ""I find that deeply disturbing."" Back in July, when WikiLeaks released the DNC emails, the government hadn’t yet named a culprit. On Oct. 7, however — the same day WikiLeaks released the emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta — the Homeland Security Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a joint statement that said, ""The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations."" The statement added that the recent hacks ""are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process."" The statement also said the intelligence community believes these attacks are directed from top levels of the Russian government, as Clinton said. ""We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,"" the statement said. The U.S. Intelligence Community is made up of 17 agencies, forming the basis of Clinton’s claim. The 17 agencies are: Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The 17 separate agencies did not independently declare Russia the perpetrator behind the hacks. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said that this cuts against Clinton’s point, saying, ""It is unlikely that all 16 of the agencies had looked independently at the Russian connection, which is what Clinton seemed to indicate."" (Cheung said 16 agencies because he omitted the Office of the Director of National Intelligence from his count.) However, as the head of the 17-agency intelligence community, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, headed by James Clapper, speaks on behalf of the group. Our ruling Clinton said, ""We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election."" We don’t know how many separate investigations into the attacks they were. But the Director of National Intelligence, which speaks for the country’s 17 federal intelligence agencies, released a joint statement saying the intelligence community at large is confident that Russia is behind recent hacks into political organizations’ emails. The statement sourced the attacks to the highest levels of the Russian government and said they are designed to interfere with the current election. We rate Clinton’s statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/542ece9a-ae39-433c-8215-4a41906b75c9 The now former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper made a comment when speaking before Congress May 8, 2017, that some readers interpreted as going against our findings in this article. Here’s why we disagree with that interpretation. We wrote this article Oct. 19, 2016, responding to an Oct. 7, 2016, joint statement from Clapper’s former office, which oversees the entire intelligence community, and Homeland Security. Clapper’s May 2017 congressional testimony, on the other hand, was about the much more comprehensive January 2017 report produced by the CIA, FBI and NSA. The process of putting that report together didn’t start until months after we published this article, in December 2016, at which point the intelligence community decided to restrict the investigation to those three agencies. Here’s what Clapper said, according to Congressional Quarterly. (""ICA"" refers to the January 2017 ""intelligence community assessment."") ""Additionally, I'll briefly address four related topics that have emerged since the ICA was produced. Because of both classification and some executive privilege strictures requested by the White House, there are limits to what I can discuss. And of course my direct official knowledge of any of this stopped on 20 January when my term of office was happily over. ""As you know, the (ICA) was a coordinated product from three agencies; CIA, NSA, and the FBI not all 17 components of the intelligence community. Those three under the aegis of my former office. Following an extensive intelligence reporting about many Russian efforts to collect on and influence the outcome of the presidential election, President Obama asked us to do this in early December and have it completed before the end of his term."" The January report presented its findings by saying ""we assess,"" with ""we"" meaning ""an assessment by all three agencies."" The October statement, on the other hand, said ""The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident"" in its assessment. As we noted in the article, the 17 separate agencies did not independently come to this conclusion, but as the head of the intelligence community, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence speaks on behalf of the group.

Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton wants to have open borders
","Donald Trump says that Hillary Clinton wants open borders — a charge he has leveled again after an excerpt of one of her speeches leaked in a hacked email. ""We have no country if we have no border. Hillary wants to give amnesty,"" Trump said during the debate held at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas Oct. 19. ""She wants to have open borders."" Clinton countered that she has supported border security for years and has included it in her presidential immigration plan. That prompted debate moderator Chris Wallace to ask Clinton to explain her remarks about ""open borders"" to the Brazilian bank Banco Itau in 2013. Here is that excerpt, as released by WikiLeaks: ""My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere."" At the debate, Clinton replied that her sentence from the speech related to energy. ""I was talking about energy. You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined,"" she said. ""And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that will be great benefit to us."" Trump shook his head, countering again: ""She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country."" We will fact-check whether Clinton is for open borders. Open borders At a rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month, Trump made a similar claim, that Clinton had made a ""radical call for open borders, meaning anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all."" We rated his claim Mostly False. The Trump campaign referred us to Clinton's pledge to offer immigration legislation within her first 100 days in office and to help Dreamers, children brought to the United States illegally as children. But that doesn’t amount to wanting open borders. Clinton supported 2013 legislation (which never passed) that included a path to citizenship with conditions and billions for border enforcement for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. As a candidate, she has said she would focus on deportations for violent criminals or those who pose threats. Some experts disagree about what ""open borders"" means. Steven Camarota, a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies which advocates for low levels of immigration, says her focus on deporting violent criminals is only a small share of the undocumented population. ""That can reasonably be seen as open borders since almost all those who join the illegal population will not have to leave, rendering the current restrictions and limits mute,"" he said. Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said Clinton hasn’t released enough specifics about her plans such as her position on the future flow of migrant workers. ""Positions on these issues would shed a lot of light on whether or not she supports something approaching open borders (although the term open borders can mean many things),"" he said. But generally we heard from experts that although Clinton wants to make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status, that’s not the same as getting rid of enforcement entirely and allowing open borders. Bank speech excerpt When WikiLeaks posted Clinton’s speech excerpt about open borders earlier this month, we asked immigration experts if her statement was a call for open borders for immigrants. The experts said Clinton’s remarks were not a clear-cut call for open borders. They also said that her statement sounded aspirational and contained no timeline or explanation as to how she would make it happen politically. (We asked the Clinton campaign for her full speech but did not get a reply to that request, so we can only evaluate the excerpt.) ""My guess would be that Clinton's Brazil speech reflects this broader call for greater hemispheric cooperation on a variety of issues, including trade,"" Stephen Kelly, a Duke University public policy professor. ""Given this context, and without seeing the rest of her speech, I would also guess that the ‘open borders’ she mentions relate to the movement of goods and capital, but not people.""   Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a policy institute focused on foreign policy and national security, said that Clinton seemed to refer to something related to travel such as the Schengen Agreement, which abolished many of the European Union’s internal borders. For example, if the United States and Canada had such an agreement, that would not mean an open border for free immigration, but rather for free travel. ""I don't think she is calling for open immigration, but the context of her remarks shows that when she says ‘open borders,’ she doesn't just mean open trade,"" he said. Jacob Vigdor, professor of public policy and governance at University of Washington, said Clinton appeared to be talking about both trade and immigration. ""I would read the remark as calling for open borders with regard to both trade and immigration. Otherwise the term ‘open trade and open borders’ would be redundant,"" he said. However, he said he saw no timetable in her remarks beyond  ""some time in the future,"" or discussion about how to make it happen. ""I don't necessarily see a contradiction between a statement of ideals and a more pragmatic policy agenda for reality,"" he said. ""One can dream of a crime-free world where there is need for neither police nor prisons while still supporting those things in reality."" Our ruling Trump said that Clinton ""wants to have open borders."" Although she wants to make it easier for some undocumented immigrants to stay here, she has repeatedly said she supports border security, so Trump is exaggerating when he says she wants open borders. In a brief speech excerpt from 2013, she called for ""a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable."" Clinton has said she was talking about clean energy, but we can’t fully evaluate her remarks to a bank because we don’t have the full speech.

Hillary Clinton says Supreme Court gun decision dealt with protecting toddlers
","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton claimed that her opposition to the 2008 Supreme Court case of District of Columbia vs. Heller was due to a desire to protect toddlers from firearms. Clinton said in the third presidential debate that she supported an individual’s right to bear arms but disagreed with how the court interpreted the Second Amendment because it didn’t accept ""reasonable regulations"" on gun ownership. ""What the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns,"" Clinton said. There’s been a lot of discussion over how Clinton views the Second Amendment, but we were curious if she was accurately describing the rationale behind the case. The Heller case itself was a challenge to the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, a broad ordinance passed by the Washington, D.C., city council that largely banned residents from owning handguns, automatic weapons and the possession of unregistered firearms, as well as requiring firearms kept in a home to be ""unloaded, disassembled, or bound by a trigger lock or similar device."" The handgun ban and subsequent gun control measures were widely considered to be one of the stricter rules on firearm ownership throughout the United States, though members of the D.C. council at the time said it seemed like the right thing to do. ""Handgun crimes were just getting out of sight,"" said Sterling Tucker, a D.C. Council chairman when the ban was enacted. ""We had to isolate and contain the problem. We thought a handgun law would do that."" Passed in the mid 1970s, the ordinance continued with several legal challenges until 2007, when a federal court invalidated the law. That decision was upheld in a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling that the handgun ban and ""trigger lock"" provisions of the ordinance violated the Second Amendment. Before the Supreme Court ruling, city leaders fought hard to keep the ban, saying that its continued implementation reduced the number of stolen firearms and guns used in other crimes. In their appeal to the Supreme Court, the city government filed a petition with the court specifically citing the dangers posed to children if the gun ban was lifted. ""The smaller the weapon, the more likely a child can use it, and children as young as three years old are strong enough to fire today’s handguns,"" the petition stated (page 25). The same petition also addressed the history of the ban, saying that in 1976 that the Council determined existing law didn’t sufficiently address gun violence and specifically cited the ""chilling regularity with which handguns were taking the lives of children."" But protecting children isn’t the only reason cited by the 30-page petition filed by the city’s government — the city also addressed general violent crime trends and other legal arguments in asking the Supreme Court to hear the case. And the court’s decision in Heller went far beyond just overturning the city’s gun ban, as it broadly affirmed for the first time an individual right to private gun ownership. Clinton’s campaign referred us to a gun control group claiming that gun locks and child access prevention laws help prevent unintentional firearm deaths for young children. PolitiFact has previously looked into whether the city’s gun ban had any effect on violent crime, finding that violent crime levels varied year-to-year and that other social and demographic factors played a larger role than gun laws. Our ruling Clinton said her opposition to the 2008 Heller case was because ""what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns."" City leaders did specifically cite the danger posed to children in trying to keep in place gun regulations, but the regulations were also a widespread ban on unregistered weapons, not just gun safety measures. Child safety wasn’t the sole topic cited by defenders of the city’s gun control ordinance, and the Heller decision dealt with a much broader issue than protecting toddlers from firearm deaths or injuries.

Hillary Clinton says 33,000 Americans die each year from guns
","Early in the third presidential debate in Las Vegas, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton got into a back and forth over guns. At one point, Clinton said, ""We have 33,000 people a year who die from guns."" Is she correct? According to data from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, there were 33,599 people who died due to guns in 2014, the most recent year available. And the number has topped 33,000 for three years running. So Clinton has a strong point. That said, it’s important to note that she is bundling together homicides, suicides and other types of gunfire, including accidental discharges and legally permissible killings such as those by law enforcement. As the following chart shows, suicides account for the largest share of gun-related deaths -- about two-thirds in recent years. And while gun-related suicides have risen by 10 percent since 2010, the number of non-suicide gun deaths has remained roughly the same. Year Deaths by guns (including suicides) Suicides alone Deaths by guns excluding suicides 2014 33,599 21,334 12,265 2013 33,636 21,175 12,461 2012 33,563 20,666 12,897 2011 32,351 19,990 12,361 2010 31,672 19,392 12,280 Average per year, 1999-2014 31,102 18,223 12,879 Clinton phrased her statement carefully -- she referred to people who ""die from guns"" without specifying the circumstances of how they were shot. Still, the fact that suicides represent such a large share of gun deaths is a detail worth noting. Our ruling Clinton said, ""We have 33,000 people a year who die from guns."" She’s correct that all deaths from guns have exceeded 33,000 during the most recent three years for which we have data. That said, it’s worth noting that roughly two-thirds of these were suicides.

Trump says heroin pours across the southern border
","In the third and final presidential debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump blamed President Barack Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for many of the problems faced by people in New Hampshire. Trump said that included drug addiction. ""The single-biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern borders, just pouring, and destroying their youth and is poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people,"" Trump said. We’ve all heard of poppy fields blooming in Afghanistan, but is Trump right that heroin is entering the United States largely through the southern border? Yes. Even though Southwest Asia supplies heroin to most of the rest of the world, nearly all of the heroin available in the United States comes from Mexico and South America. ""Mexico, and to a lesser extent, Colombia, dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy US heroin demand,"" the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration wrote in its National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015. ""Mexico continues as the primary supplier of heroin to the United States,"" the White House’s page on the international heroin market reads. ""Estimated cultivation of opium poppy reached 10,500 hectares in 2012, with an estimated pure potential production of 26 metric tons."" Here’s a chart from the DEA report demonstrating the prevalence of heroin from the southern border:  As you can see, South America and Mexico have been the sources for much of the heroin in U.S. markets for the past two decades. In recent years, Mexican traffickers have expanded by simultaneously wedging black tar heroin into Northeastern markets dominated by Colombian white powder heroin and increasing production and distribution of white powder heroin themselves. Mexican heroin accounted for 45 percent of the total weight of heroin the DEA seized and analyzed in 2012 (South American heroin accounted for 51 percent). By 2014, the proportion of Mexican heroin had grown to 79 percent (South American heroin made up about 17 percent), DEA spokesman Russell Baer told PolitiFact in September. This market share is also reflected in the amount of heroin seized at the border and the amount grown in Mexico. From 2013 to 2015, the amount of poppy fields cultivated in Mexico increased by 169 percent from 11,000 hectares to 28,000 hectares, according to Baer.   In 2008, the total amount of heroin seized at the U.S.-Mexico border (about 560 kilograms) surpassed the amount seized from commercial airlines for the first time (about 400 kilograms). Border seizures nearly quadrupled from 2008 to 2015 (2,210 kilograms), according to data provided to us by Baer. ""The majority of the drugs in the U.S. market are trafficked across the Southwest Border from Mexico into the US. Southwest Border seizures conducted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, while not the complete picture, provide insight into trafficking trends,"" he said. Traffickers typically smuggle the drugs in through secret compartments in vehicles across the border (illegally and legally), transport them to stash houses in hub cities like Dallas, Los Angeles and Phoenix, and then distribute to the Midwest and East Coast. Our ruling Trump said heroin ""pours across our southern borders."" The vast majority of heroin in the United States comes from Mexico and South America.

Group says Colorado Senate candidate 'voted to use taxpayer dollars for China trip.' She never went
","A conservative group continues to use a two-year-old debunked claim that Democratic Colorado state Senate candidate Rachel Zenzinger once voted to use taxpayer money to take a trip China. PolitiFact Colorado in July rated a similar mailer claim, by the group Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government, Pants On Fire. On Oct. 19, Zenzinger said, ""Enough!"" She filed a complaint with the Jefferson County District Attorney’s Office accusing the group of violating Colorado election laws by circulating a mailer containing a ""false statement designed to affect the vote"" in the election for state Senate District 19, which includes Denver suburbs Arvada and Westminster. A conviction of the misdemeanor offense carries a potential county jail sentence as well as a fine. Zenzinger’s complaint focuses on a flier mailed to voters on Oct. 14 by the group. The mailer states: ""When Rachel Zenzinger was on the Arvada City Council, she voted to spend taxpayer funds for a junket to China. She wanted taxpayers to pay the bill for her airfare, lodging, transportation and food."" The mailer clearly gives the impression that not only did Zenzinger vote to take a taxpayer-funded trip, but she went on the trip to China, too. In a mailer photograph, the group inserted a traditional Vietnamese bamboo hat on Zenzinger’s head with a Chinese rooftop in the background. ""This is a lie that has been debunked repeatedly,"" Zenzinger told Denver7 and PolitiFact. ""The reason I'm filing the complaint is that I believe that they actually have crossed the line to where this is criminal. It's not even a stretching of the truth. It's just not the truth, and it's being used to influence voters."" ""That needs to stop,"" she added. We reached out to Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government but hadn’t received a reply. On July 5, PolitiFact and its partner Denver7 checked the facts of an earlier mailer from Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government that said, ""While serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer funded junket to China."" PolitiFact rated the mailer Pants on Fire, its worst rating reserved for ridiculous statements. There are key problems with these attacks. While on the Arvada City Council in 2013, Zenzinger made -- and then voted for -- a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for a proposed sister-city delegation to China. No city officials ever went on the trip. But you wouldn’t know that from this mailer, or a 2014 TV ad called ""China Girl"" that targeted Zenzinger, who was running to hang onto her Senate seat. In April 2013, Zenzinger was a newly appointed Arvada City Councilwoman who took part in a motion regarding a sister city agreement with the Chinese city of Jinzhou. The council members were discussing an invitation from the mayor of Jinzhou to send an official delegation from Arvada to the 2013 World Landscape Art Exposition. A nonprofit group, Arvada Sister Cities International, recommended that the invitation be accepted and that an official delegation -- including Arvada city officials, members of the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Arvada Sister Cities -- attend the Jinzhou expo. Councilman Bob Dyer made a motion to accept the group’s recommendation and send a delegation to Jinzhou, according to the meeting minutes. The motion made no mention of funding for the trip, according to the minutes. Mayor Marc Williams said he was uncomfortable using public funds on the trip. The mayor said ""since he understands the motion includes sending delegation members from the city at city expense, he cannot support it,"" according to the minutes. However, he said he would back sending Zenzinger as the elected representative if her travel was privately funded. Zenzinger voted for the Dyer motion to send a delegation, but it failed, 4-3. Zenzinger then made her own motion, saying if a city delegation was sent, no taxpayer money would be used. ""Mayor Pro Tem Zenzinger clarified ... that if Sister Cities is unable to fund them, then we would come back and decline the invitation,"" according to the minutes. Her motion passed 5-2. Ultimately, no city officials or employees went to China because no private funding was found. Our ruling In a political mailer, Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government stated, ""When Rachel Zenzinger was on the Arvada City Council, she voted to spend taxpayer funds for a junket to China."" As of a council member, Zenzinger did vote on a failed motion to send an official delegation to a sister-city event in China. But not only did Zenzinger initiate a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for the delegation to China, but she never even went to China.

In debate, Portman and Strickland spar over Medicare quote
","The first debate between incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman and former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland got a little chippy over the future of entitlements like Social Security and Medicare. Responding to a question about the threat of Social Security funds being depleted by the year 2034, Portman said that he was in favor of ""means testing,"" a method of adjusting benefits according to a taxpayer’s wealth. ""And that’s part of the answer,"" Portman said. ""I have supported that also, with Medicare.""   The question then went to Strickland, who leapt at the chance to repeat a talking point he’s used before in his campaign. ""Since Sen. Portman brought up Medicare,"" Strickland said, ""on the Neil Cavuto show, he said that it would be irresponsible not to cut Medicare. Those are his words."" Portman interrupted, ""Irresponsible not to save it."" ""Senator,"" Strickland said, ""your words were it would be irresponsible not to cut it."" Portman shook his head in disagreement. We decided to go to the tape — and Portman’s YouTube channel took us right to it. Here’s the exchange from June 2011 in which Portman, on Fox News, criticized Obama’s ""Summer of Recovery,"" and discussed methods of addressing the national debt and deficit (emphasis ours): Cavuto: ""So what are some of the things you want to cut, right now?"" Portman: ""Everything has to be on the table. So we have to deal with the entitlement programs, because they’re not sustainable in their current form -- they’re not going to be there for future generations."" Cavuto: ""So when Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid say, ‘not Medicare,’ what do you say?"" Portman: ""That they’re being irresponsible and they know it. They’re playing politics. If we don’t deal with these programs that are now 60 percent of our budget, think about that. When you add up interest on the debt and the mandatory spending, and the entitlement programs -- very important programs --  that’s 60 percent of the budget now, it’s the fastest-growing part of the budget. For them to take that off the table means they’re not serious about dealing with our deficit and debt."" We see from this exchange that Portman didn’t talk about saving Medicare, as he stated in the debate, but proposed that all entitlements including Medicare needed to be considered in terms of cost-cutting. However, Portman’s statement was a hypothetical one, part of a discussion about Portman’s disagreement with his colleagues in the Senate about managing entitlements. It was not an official policy statement or part of proposed legislation on Portman’s part, as Strickland’s debate statement suggested. Our ruling Strickland said Portman went on television and said ""it would be irresponsible not to cut Medicare. Those are his words."" Those were not Portman's exact words on Cavuto's show.

Trump wrongfully says immigrants voting illegally won North Carolina for Obama in 2008
","In his ongoing mission to claim that the presidential election is being rigged against him, Donald Trump said there have been real-world instances of stolen elections. We have already ruled Trump’s claims of ""large scale voter fraud"" nationwide this year to be Pants On Fire, but on Monday night Trump made a much more specific claim during a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin. ""It’s possible that non-citizen voters were responsible for Obama’s 2008 victory in North Carolina,"" Trump said. North Carolina’s 15 electoral votes hardly would have made 2008 Republican nominee John McCain the president – Obama won 365 votes in the Electoral College to McCain’s 173. But this claim of an illegitimate victory is still a pretty shocking accusation coming from the current Republican nominee. We wondered if it could be true. Could illegally cast ballots have handed North Carolina to Obama in 2008? North Carolina figures to be a toss-up again this year, after it narrowly went for Mitt Romney in 2012. A RealClearPolitics average of polling from the first half of October showed Hillary Clinton with a 3-point lead over Trump in the Tar Heel State. Evidence of illegal voting? Elections expert Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at UC-Irvine, said Trump is wrong. ""I don’t think it’s possible,"" said Hasen, who runs the ElectionLawBlog.org website. But what do Trump and his campaign say about the statement? After Trump’s speech Monday, his campaign’s co-chairman Sam Clovis defended Trump’s argument in an interview with a radio show affiliated with the Boston Herald newspaper. ""I don’t think it’s irresponsible,"" Clovis said. ""I think it raises an issue."" That issue, he said, is some states have made it easier for immigrants living here illegally to get driver’s licenses – and, he said, that makes it easier for them to vote. However, North Carolina does not allow such immigrants to get licenses at all, so it’s unclear why Clovis brought that up. Nevertheless, we did some digging and found what Trump or his speechwriters seemed to be citing – a 2014 op-ed from one of the newspapers Trump once banned from his rallies, the Washington Post. In it, two political science professors said they had studied how often immigrants – here legally or illegally – might vote in U.S. elections. Trump quoted from their study almost verbatim in his speech, although he did not mention that there are serious concerns over its validity. Significant statistical errors? On the Washington Post website, above the op-ed about the study, you see an editor’s note that the study has earned at least three separate rebuttals, as well as a peer-reviewed article saying the data the study used doesn’t provide evidence of what the study claimed. The original study’s authors have defended their work, but we have to ask: Is Trump citing a debunked study? The main issue deals with sourcing and sampling. The authors of the study didn’t do the survey work themselves but instead pulled it from data collected by the Harvard-affiliated Cooperative Congressional Election Study. However, two weeks after the study was first published in 2014, the CCES wrote a response that has advised researchers not to use its data in that way – because its data on non-citizens drew from a very small sample size of 339 respondents nationwide. The CCES furthermore said that it wasn’t specifically surveying non-citizen voting habits, so it didn’t correct for errors in that portion of its survey – and that it believed 16 or 17 percent of the respondents mistakenly reported they were non-citizens, either because they were confused or simply clicked the wrong box on the online survey. The CCES researchers repeated those concerns in another op-ed for the Washington Post, published this week after Trump resurfaced the old study that relied on their work. Among the 339 supposedly non-citizen respondents, 38 (11.3 percent) said they voted. The researchers in the study that Trump cited were unable to confirm 33 of those votes, leaving them with five verified votes (1.5 percent). Like the political scientists who have called this study into question, we have a hard time using five (or even 38) anecdotes to extrapolate a scenario for the entire country, involving millions of people. But for the sake of argument, we’ll put that apprehension aside and look at the data. There were approximately 650,000 immigrants in North Carolina in 2008, about a quarter of whom were citizens. That means there were approximately 487,500 non-citizen immigrants. Surely they weren’t all adults, but let’s pretend they were. If 1.5 percent of them voted, that would mean 7,313 non-citizens voted in North Carolina in 2008. Obama won the state by about 14,000 votes, so even if every single one of them had voted for Obama, their illegal voting would not have been enough to sway the election. So even using the widely criticized study’s findings, in order to come up with a result that influenced the election you would have to: 1. Double their verified rate of voting, 2. Assume that no immigrants are under the age of 18, and 3. Assume that McCain received 0 percent of the non-citizen vote. We simply don’t think that’s likely, and neither does at least one federal appeals court. Hasen, the election law expert, wrote in the Wall Street Journal this week that ""the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit concluded last month than only a ""tiny fraction"" of voters are non-citizens and that there is no evidence it is a serious problem."" Actual allegations in North Carolina are few and far between We also checked with the N.C. Board of Elections, which said in a statement: ""We have no indication that thousands of non-citizens voted in the 2008 elections, and we don’t believe that amount of potential voter fraud would have gone unnoticed or unchallenged."" In 2008, North Carolina reported 23 allegations of non-residents either voting or registering to vote. Elections board spokesman Pat Gannon said while the office currently tracks such allegations after referring them to the courts, it did not in 2008, so it’s unclear how many of those 23 reported cases were actually illegal. Scott Huffmon, a political science professor at Winthrop University, said the 23 allegations could include immigrants (legal residents as well as those living here illegally) as well as U.S. citizens from other states. He also that, in general, it would make no sense for an immigrant living in the U.S. illegally to try to vote. ""Would any rational person put themselves in jeopardy of being deported for the virtual zero probability of influencing an election?"" Huffmon said. Our ruling  Trump said ""it’s possible"" that Obama won North Carolina in 2008 because of non-citizens voting illegally. There is no evidence to support that theory, and that’s not for a lack of attention. A federal appeals court has looked into it, as has the N.C. Board of Elections, and both found nothing of concern.

Mike Pence wrong on Haiti contracts steered to Clinton friends
","For Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence, recently revealed State Department emails are a smoking gun that prove how Clinton Foundation donors cashed in on their political connections. And Pence was clearly frustrated that this alleged pay-for-play is getting little attention. ""Revelations coming out of Secretary of State Clinton's years in the State Department and the Clinton Foundation are virtually ignored by the national media,"" Pence said on Oct. 16, 2016, on NBC’s Meet the Press.  ""I mean we discovered this week that State Department officials actually directed contracts for the Haitian recovery effort after the earthquake to friends of the Clintons."" Did State Department officials actually steer Haiti relief contracts to friends of Bill and Hillary Clinton? While there was contact between the State Department and friends of the Clintons, we found no evidence of that contracts were actually awarded. We asked the Donald Trump campaign to send us proof and did not hear back. But we did speak to staff at the Republican National Committee, which used the Freedom of Information Act to get State Department emails during the weeks right after the 2010 earthquake. The RNC shared the emails with ABC News and referred us to the ABC News story that emerged. (When we asked, the RNC also shared the emails with us.) RNC Research Director Raj Shah focused on two instances when he said foundation donors ""gained access to officials that people who weren’t friends of the Clintons didn’t."" But importantly, Shah also said it isn’t clear that those with Clinton ties in fact ultimately won contracts. That is ""the case we have to make,"" Shah said. Let’s look at the two examples. The ABC News story The 2010 earthquake devastated Haiti. Entire city blocks had crumbled. The damage was everywhere, striking hospitals, power systems and the water supply. The world scrambled to respond, and Clinton Foundation donors contacted the foundation. On top of the foundation’s work in Haiti, since 2009, Bill Clinton had been the United Nations special envoy to Haiti. Emails to the foundation made their way to the State Department. Under the headline ""How Hillary's State Dept. Gave Special Attention to 'Friends of Bill' After Haiti Quake,"" the ABC report revealed many instances of State Department staffers giving priority status to people with ties to the Clintons. In one case, Rolando Gonzalez-Bunster, a foundation board member, sent an email to his contacts at the Clinton Foundation. As is laid out in the email, Gonzalez-Bunster hoped to get satellite images of the damage to Haiti’s electric grid to help guide engineers he was sending to do reconstruction work.  Literally within a few hours, the Clinton Foundation forwarded the email to the State Department and a State Department staffer had forwarded Gonzalez-Bunster’s email to the chief operating officer of the U.S. Agency for International Development with the subject line ""Clinton friend/wanting info."" Below that, the email said ""Rolando is a close friend of the Secretary and the former President dating back to Georgetown."" Did his company get a contract? No. Gonzalez-Bunster told ABC News that all the work to restore power was donated and that later, his company got an award for its effort -- an award for its charity, not a contract to do more work. Then there was Garry Mauro, the Texas state chairman for both of Clinton’s presidential campaigns and a foundation donor -- he gave between $25,000 and $50,000. An associate of Mauro contacted the Clinton Foundation on behalf of DRC Emergency Services, a major disaster relief contractor. That email came with a detailed list of the earthmoving equipment DRC had on the ground in Haiti. That was passed along to the State Department with the advisory, ""This is from a partner of Garry Mauro, a friend of WJC (William Jefferson Clinton), offering major assets in Haiti."" A second email noted ""Garry is also a friend of the Secretary’s.""  Did DRC get a contract to work in Haiti? Not from the American government. You won’t find the company at all in a comprehensive spreadsheet of Haiti disaster relief contracts from the Federal Procurement Data System. (The company did contract with the U.S. Defense Department in 2011, but we could find no record that the work was related to Haiti.) Company videos show that DRC removed the rubble of collapsed buildings and put up temporary worker housing in Haiti, but there’s no indication that the State Department played a role in that. DRC already had a presence in the country, and as the Miami Herald reported, it knew how to secure contracts directly from the Haitian government. Lastly, the Republican National Committee mentioned former Federal Emergency Management Administration chief James Lee Witt, whose firm won a nearly $100,000 contract within days of the earthquake. The U.S. Agency for International Development wanted a quick initial assessment of the overall damage. The relevance is unclear. Although Witt served during the Clinton administration, he was not mentioned in the State Department emails, and so they don’t shed light on any special treatment. The Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning research and advocacy group, has criticized the Clintons and the relief work in Haiti. Lead researcher Jake Johnston said there are good reasons to challenge the Clintons’ projects in the country, but while the emails show special notice of foundation donors, they don’t show more than that. ""There is no evidence that contracts or U.S. government funding was then ‘directed’ towards any of them (the donors),"" Johnston told us. Lastly, we note that we found one anonymous third-hand account on the Breitbart website, a conservative website that supports Trump’s candidacy. That report cites an unnamed friend of an unnamed friend telling John Bolton, the former United Nations ambassador under President George W. Bush, that one company was given preference for a contract. That sort of evidence is the thinnest form of hearsay. Our ruling Pence said that State Department officials steered Haiti relief contracts to friends of the Clintons. That charge rests on a news report based on emails between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation. Those emails show only that well-connected people saw their offers of help put on a fast track. Neither the emails nor a search of government contract databases show that the government gave contracts to any of those people or their firms to help in Haiti. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2016/oct/19/mike-pence/pence-wrong-haiti-contracts-steered-clinton-friend/

Hazy data makes Colorado marijuana claim by Scott Jones Half True
","Asked about California’s effort to legalize recreational marijuana, Republican congressional candidate Scott Jones said the experiences in Colorado are a stark warning of what not to do. Jones is Sacramento County’s sheriff and is running against Democratic Rep. Ami Bera for the region’s 7th District Congressional seat. ""We can look to Colorado ... and look at the horrific results,"" Jones said during a debate this week between the two candidates in Sacramento. ""If you look at the increased incidents of emergency room visits by young people. If you look at the increased incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana. All voters have to do is see what happened in Colorado to predict what’s going to happen here.""  Scott Jones makes his claim about marijuana at about the 10:20 minute mark in the video above. California voters in November will decide on Proposition 64, which would legalize recreational pot for those 21 and older. Both Jones and Bera oppose the measure. Several other states will also vote on legalizing recreational or medicinal marijuana on Election Day. Colorado voted to legalize marijuana in 2012 and the law went into effect in 2014. We wondered if Jones was right? Did Colorado see a spike in ER trips by young people and more cases of driving while stoned after it legalized pot? Our research The first part of Jones’ statement appears to be correct. Several studies document a rise in trips to Colorado emergency rooms by young people. As reported in the Denver Post in July, a study in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics found ""Colorado’s laws on labeling and child-resistant packaging have been unable to stop an increase of young kids ending up in the emergency room after accidentally consuming marijuana."" The study found ""... cases for pediatric marijuana increased significantly and at a higher rate than the rest of the United States."" Examining Jones’ claim about an increase in incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana was more complex. There’s not much data yet on the topic because the state only started tracking marijuana-related traffic incidents in 2014, according to a Colorado State Patrol spokesman quoted in the Denver Post last year. Jones’ campaign manager pointed us to a Colorado State Patrol report showing mixed results. It says the percentage of DUIs in the state where marijuana or marijuana in combination with alcohol or other drugs was the perceived impairing substance increased from 12 percent in 2014 to 15 percent in 2015. The same report, however, shows the raw number of citations for DUIs involving marijuana or marijuana in combination with other drugs dropped slightly during the same two years, from 674 to 665. A separate Colorado study pointed to by Jones’ campaign reported there’s been an increase in the percentage of drivers testing positive for marijuana involved in fatal traffic accidents. Making things more cloudy, however, that report includes a note from the Colorado State Patrol that ""marijuana citations"" are defined as those where marijuana was present ""based on officer opinion only,"" noting there’s ""no toxicological confirmation."" Radley Balko, who blogs about criminal justice for the Washington Post, wrote in 2014 that a spike in the number of drivers who are tested and found to have traces of marijuana in their system would not be a surprise in Colorado, nor would it mean marijuana necessarily contributed to a traffic accident. ""All that a positive test tells us is that the driver has smoked pot at some point in the past few days or weeks,"" Balko wrote, noting the drug can linger in a person’s system for days after its effects wear off. ""It makes sense that loosening restrictions on pot would result in a higher percentage of drivers involved in fatal traffic accidents having smoked the drug at some point over the past few days or weeks,"" Balko added. Our ruling Scott Jones said Colorado saw ""increased incidents of emergency room visits by young people"" and ""increased incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana"" following the state’s legalization of recreational marijuana. Studies show the state indeed experienced a spike in ER visits by young people related to marijuana. Less clear is how marijuana-related traffic incidents have changed since the state legalized the drug. Studies have limited data and show mixed results. Further complicating the matter, marijuana can remain in a driver’s system days after the effect of the drug has worn off, making it difficult to determine whether the drug was the primary factor in an accident. Jones’ statement on the ER visits is accurate. But there’s not enough convincing data to prove the second portion of his claim. We rate it Half True.

Ami Bera’s Mostly True claim: Feds cleared me of election fraud
","Babulal Bera, the father of Rep. Ami Bera, D-Elk Grove, was sentenced to a year in prison this summer for making illegal contributions to his son’s campaigns for Congress in 2010 and 2012. Rep. Bera, during a debate this week in Sacramento against Republican Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones, his opponent in the race for the 7th Congressional District, said federal investigators found he had no prior knowledge of his father’s illegal activity. ""The U.S. Attorney was pretty clear. They did a thorough investigation. They were consistent that I was never the target of this investigation,"" Bera said. ""They were consistent that neither I nor my campaign had any idea what was going on. And that’s why they closed this case.""  Rep. Bera makes his claim at about the 6:20 minute mark in the video above. Moments later, Jones took issue with Bera’s statement: ""I disagree with the statement that the U.S. Attorney said they didn’t know anything about it. I think what they said was they couldn’t find any evidence to suggest Congressman Bera or his staff knew about it. And that’s a difference."" Had Bera taken statements by federal investigators out of context? We decided to check the facts, with a focus on the portion of Bera’s statement that the U.S. Attorney’s Office said ""neither I nor my campaign had any idea what was going on. And that’s why they closed this case."" Our research To back up the congressman’s claim, the Bera campaign pointed to statements by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in May and September. Here’s what acting U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert said in a May news conference in Sacramento after Bera’s father pleaded guilty to election fraud: ""To date, there is no indication from what we’ve learned in the investigation that either the congressman or his campaign staff knew of, or participated in,"" the crimes by Bera’s father. In September, Talbert’s office released a prepared statement saying ""no other charges will be sought in this matter"" and that it had concluded its investigation into the illegal contributions. It did not elaborate further on why it closed the case. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office declined to address that question this week. Our ruling Rep. Bera’s statement that federal investigators said he and his campaign ""had no idea what was going on"" mostly matches with Talbert’s May comments. Still, it’s not entirely clear why the case was closed. We don’t know for sure without an explanation from the U.S. Attorney’s Office, which declined to elaborate on the subject. What we do know is Bera was investigated and no charges were brought against him. Bera’s statement is not far from the mark. It would have been completely correct, however, if Bera had repeated what the U.S. attorney said that there was ""no indication"" he or his campaign had any connection to the crime. His statement could have benefited from this key clarification. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Has John McCain taken the most Wall Street money of any sitting senator?
","The first and only U.S. Senate debate between Sen. John McCain and his Democratic challenger, U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Flagstaff, featured plenty of partisan finger-pointing. McCain accused Kirkpatrick of standing with Hillary Clinton while Kirkpatrick lobbied the same attacks, wondering why it took the senior senator so long to renounce Donald Trump. ""You know, there was a day John McCain was a maverick and would stand up to his party,"" Kirkpatrick said during the Oct. 10 debate. ""Now, he has taken more money from Wall Street than any other sitting senator."" This claim against the 2008 Republican presidential nominee jumped out at us. We have heard similar Wall Street-related attacks this presidential cycle. Just last month, Trump claimed Clinton has received ""$100 million from Wall Street and hedge funds."" We rated it False, because the number is closer to $64 million. And in March, Clinton said President Barack Obama took more money from Wall Street during his 2008 campaign ""than anybody ever had."" We rated it Mostly True -- Mitt Romney eventually broke the record in 2012. We wondered, has McCain been in the pockets of Wall Street? The contributions Kirkpatrick campaign spokesman D.B. Mitchell pointed us to their analysis of campaign contributions from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. As we’ve noted previously, the center considers the ""securities and investment"" category as the most Wall Street-centric. Kirkpatrick’s camp also included contributions from the ""commercial banks"" and ""miscellaneous finance"" categories. We should also note that these contributions do not come from the firms themselves, but individuals. Here is how the numbers stack up: SECURITIES & INVESTMENT MISC FINANCE COMMERCIAL BANKS TOTAL JOHN MCCAIN $12,665,118 $6,495,872 $2,844,073 $22,005,063 CHARLES SCHUMER $12,616,062 $1,832,371 $1,609,677 $16,058,110 MITCH MCCONNELL $4,119,160 $1,204,439 $1,269,839 $6,593,438 McCain, who was elected to the Senate in 1987, does appear to have taken the most contributions -- more than $22 million -- from Wall Street. But, there are some caveats. Presidential fundraising McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero said the numbers are skewed because they include contributions made during the senator’s 2008 presidential run. She noted that he is the only current member of Congress to win his party’s nomination. ""That’s a different level of campaigning and fundraising,"" Romero said. That’s fair because, overall, Obama and Clinton have taken the most money from Wall Street, former senators with presidential runs in their own right. According to Viveca Novak, a spokeswoman with the Center for Responsive Politics, McCain received more than $19 million from Wall Street during his presidential run. ""For his presidential campaign, he received $10,804,533 from Securities & Investment, $5,902,217 from Misc Finance and $2,372,700 from Commercial Banks,"" she said. Michael Traugott, a research professor at the University of Michigan, said Kirkpatrick’s claim is misleading. ""Taking into account contributions across a career would be a misleading comparison with other U.S. senators who have not served for the same length of time or been a presidential candidate,"" Traugott said. ""I think those qualifiers should be taken into account."" Our ruling Kirkpatrick said, ""(McCain) has taken more money from Wall Street than any other sitting senator. The numbers are on the mark, but need clarification. McCain ran for president in 2008, which does involve a higher level of fundraising. Excluding his presidential run, the senior senator has taken significantly less money from Wall Street.

Roy Cooper says Pat McCrory took $500,000 from disaster relief funds for HB2
","As flooding from Hurricane Matthew continues to ravage much of eastern North Carolina, even days after the storm subsided, the state’s preparedness has become a political fight. Roy Cooper, the Democratic challenger for governor who is also the state’s attorney general, accused Republican Gov. Pat McCrory of a short-sighted move to divert emergency funds into defending a partisan controversy. ""Gov. McCrory took $500,000 directly out of the disaster relief fund,"" Cooper said during their Oct. 11 debate. ""And you know what it’s for? House Bill 2."" HB2, or the ""bathroom bill"" as it’s commonly known, has become one of the defining issues of this election. There are several parts to it, including restricting bathroom access for transgender people in public buildings and excluding LGBT people from discrimination protections. We’ve written many fact-checks on HB2, including whether it took away any existing rights, how unique North Carolina’s LGBT protections (or lack thereof) are now, and the risk of sexual predators due to transgender-friendly bathroom rules. For all our fact checks on the law, see here. McCrory signed HB2 in March. Since then private citizens have sued, and so has the U.S. Department of Justice, which argues it violates civil rights laws. Cooper, as attorney general, has refused to defend HB2 in court. He says he believes it’s unconstitutional. We fact-checked whether he’s allowed to do that here. With Cooper out, the state will have to hire other lawyers – unless the legislature repeals HB2, which Cooper has urged but which legislative leaders have so far refused to do. And that’s what brings us to this claim. Cooper said McCrory pulled $500,000 from disaster funds to use for those lawyers, but McCrory retorted it wasn’t true. ""We haven’t spent one dollar of the disaster relief money. We were approved to by the legislature, and I made a statement: We will not spend any of that money. (Cooper) knows that. He’s being deceptive to the public of North Carolina."" McCrory’s campaign later called Cooper’s claim ""the lie of the night."" Starting with the basics Cooper is right about the amount of money. A new law ordered the transfer of $500,000 of disaster relief money to McCrory’s office for ""costs incurred from litigation related to"" HB2. Cooper said McCrory ""took"" that money, but ""took"" has multiple meanings. One is more active, like ""grabbed. "" The other is more passive, like ""accepted."" It might also refer to a certain foolish hobbit, but we won’t get into that. So we need to ask if McCrory actively took the money, passively took the money, or both. Let’s start with passive taking. Did McCrory accept the money? Did he object to it? Veto power Cooper’s main argument during the debate was that McCrory didn’t object to the money being moved, since he allowed the bill in question to become law. ""The governor could’ve vetoed this legislation that took this $500,000 out of the Disaster Relief Fund, but he did not,"" Cooper said. ""He did not veto it."" The money came to McCrory on July 1 in a bill making multiple changes and corrections to the state budget. McCrory said he didn’t veto the bill because he didn’t want to risk stopping other important changes if his veto succeeded. But that excuse doesn’t hold water. The legislature could’ve easily overridden his veto, which requires a 60-percent majority to do. This bill received 46 of 50 votes in the Senate (92 percent) and 89 of 120 votes in the House (74 percent). McCrory has issued six vetoes as governor, four of which have been overridden. His latest came less than a month before this budget bill. At the time, he said it would probably be overridden but ""part of the reason to veto a bill is to make sure the public is aware of exactly what’s in a bill."" And less than a week before the funding bill came to his desk, he threatened to veto another bill over several parts that he didn’t like; the legislature rewrote those parts in response. However, after McCrory let the funding bill become law, he did almost immediately say he had no intention of actually using the money – a statement he repeated again at the debate. Show me the money So McCrory accepted the money with no strong formal objections, like a veto. We also know that McCrory asked for $500,000 to be set aside for lawyers for HB2 – that it wasn’t just imposed on him by the legislature. But both McCrory’s general counsel, Bob Stephens, and the office of Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger have said McCrory just asked for the money in general and never specifically suggested pulling it from disaster relief funds – so the legislature bears responsibility for that choice. But where’s the money now? The budget changes say that the $500,000 from the disaster relief fund ""shall be transferred to the Governor's Office"" for HB2’s legal costs. However, Berger’s office told us the money has yet to actually be transferred, despite the apparently authoritative wording of the law. ""As a practical matter, $500,000 has not been moved from the disaster relief fund,"" said Berger spokeswoman Shelly Carver. She added: ""Further, the governor has said he will not spend any disaster relief funds on legal expenses, which is within his discretion."" But similarly, McCrory also has the discretion to move the money in the future if he wants. And what’s less clear is whether the money could still move even against his wishes, since the law says the funds ""shall transfer"" to his office. The word ""shall"" is tricky in legal writing and we simply don’t know exactly how it might be interpreted here. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in 1995 that ""though shall generally means must, legal writers sometimes use, or misuse, shall to mean should, will or even may."" Our ruling Cooper said ""Governor McCrory took $500,000 directly out of the disaster relief fund"" to spend on lawyers to defend the controversial HB2 legislation. McCrory did ask for the money, although there’s no proof he asked for it to be taken specifically from disaster relief – an especially touchy topic now with so much flooding ravaging the state. The money is still in the disaster relief fund, which is a mark against Cooper’s claim, but nevertheless it is still earmarked for HB2, meaning McCrory could take it in the future. And although he has said he won’t, he also didn’t attempt to stop the money from being moved out of disaster relief by using his veto power. Cooper’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2016/oct/19/roy-cooper/roy-cooper-says-pat-mccrory-took-500000-disaster-r/
