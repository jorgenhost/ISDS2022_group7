Todd Staples says U.S. Constitution provides for just compensation when government takes land
","
Republican Todd Staples, the state agriculture commissioner seeking re-election against Democrat Hank Gilbert, is no lawyer.

But he kinda played one in a Sept. 16 interview on an Austin radio station. Staples, pitching for listeners to sign an online petition urging the 2011 Legislature to embrace ""true eminent-domain reforms,"" told KVET-FM morning hosts Bob Cole and Bucky Godbolt: ""What we're talking about is a basic constitutional right of property owners. Our United States Constitution says that if eminent domain has to be used, a property owner must be justly compensated, period.""

The Bill of Rights says pay up? Get out (that's just an expression).

The actual language doesn't say ""must,"" but the meaning aligns with Staples' comment. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution says no private property shall ""be taken for public use, without just compensation.""

Nationally, Staples is among figures to air frets about the power of government to ""take"" property for declared public  purposes, in part reacting a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court decision, in Kelo v. City of New London, upholding a community's right to take property for an economic redevelopment project; the plaintiff had maintained the city's plan for her land did not constitute ""public use"" under the Fifth Amendment.

According to an April 2009 article in the American Bar Association's Journal, 43 states enacted statutes or constitutional amendments restricting the use of eminent domain in the wake of the court ruling, while at least five state supreme courts issued rulings to ""significantly impede government power to take private property.""

In Texas, the federal ruling contributed to the 2009 Legislature proposing a state constitutional amendment which voters adopted last year. The amendment prohibits the taking of private property for transfer to a private entity for the purpose of economic development or to increase tax revenues, according to the Texas Secretary of State's office.

Gilbert has questioned Staples' bonafides for talking up laws against government taking private property without just compensation. In a Sept. 17 press release, the Democrat singles out measures Staples supported as a state senator to suggest he's not always aligned with private property owners.

That sally may be valid; we're not judging it here. We rate Staples' statement to KVET as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC04AE80>],/factchecks/2010/sep/28/todd-staples/todd-staples-says-us-constitution-provides/
"['Georgia', 'Transportation', 'Georgia State Road and Tollway Authority']","
Road authority reverses course on Ga. 400 toll
","
The grinding traffic and NASCAR-like driving habits of Atlanta-area motorists are enough to infuriate any motorist who uses the toll road Ga. 400.

Some drivers, though, were comforted by the thought they wouldn't have to pay the 50-cent toll much longer.

That changed Friday when the State Road and Tollway Authority voted to extend the toll to 2020. The toll was set to expire in 2011, when the bonds used to fund construction of the road extension are to be paid off. The authority's board has discussed briefly suspending the toll shortly after the bonds are paid off and then reinstating it. Some critics say temporarily suspending the toll is a sly attempt to avoid criticism that the authority reneged on an agreement to permanently stop collecting it.

So did the authority flip-flop?

Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint said of the plan: ""This is a political act to avoid being accused of going back on their word.""

Let's look at how the authority got to this point.

Atlanta and state leaders began seriously looking in the late 1980s at a proposal aimed at improving traffic from the city's northern suburbs to downtown. The proposal was to create a 6.2-mile extension of Ga. 400 from the suburbs to I-85. Commuters would pay a 50-cent toll each way. Some neighborhood groups in Atlanta's Buckhead community strongly opposed the project. Robb Pitts, then an Atlanta city councilman, said he came up with a compromise that was included in Section 1(f) of a July 5, 1989, letter from the Georgia Department of Transportation to then-Mayor Andrew Young.

""That all tolls shall be discontinued upon full payment of all bonds which are issued to finance construction of the Georgia 400 Extension and the Buckhead Loop,"" the stipulation read. ""The Georgia Department of Transportation agrees to this stipulation.""

Pitts, now a Fulton County commissioner, said the Ga. 400 extension would not have passed if not for that agreement. The authority estimates nearly 120,000 people use the extension every day. State officials estimate they'll collect nearly $21 million from the toll in the 12-month period that began July 1.

Now, let's get in the fast lane and move to September 2010. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution learned some state leaders were considering plans to continue the toll, although the bonds for the extension construction were scheduled to be paid off in 2011. The authority came up with a wish list of road projects it would like to implement if it had more money from sources such as, say, a Ga. 400 toll. The list includes connector ramps at the interchange at I-85 in Buckhead and widening the road between McFarland Road and Ga. 20.

Pitts came to Friday's meeting but said he wasn't allowed to speak. The Fulton commissioner said he talked with Gov. Sonny Perdue, chairman of the authority board, and told him that extending the toll could hurt support for a 2012 voter referendum on a regional transportation funding plan that was passed by state leaders this year after years of debate.

""If [the voters] can't trust you on [ending the toll], how can we trust you in 2012?"" Pitts said he asked Perdue.

Pitts suggested the authority stop the toll during a 30-day public comment period the authority allows to hear from state residents about items it has approved. The authority would look into stopping the toll at some point next year and charging motorists again as a ""new"" toll. When asked how long would the suspension be, the governor replied ""brief,"" said AJC transportation reporter Ariel Hart, who covered the meeting.

How brief? Perdue said he didn't know and then seemingly half-jokingly added ""hours.""

Pitts said he supports the improvements on I-85.

""It's not my preference, but it's a fallback position,"" Pitts said. ""You may get more support for [extending the toll].""

Atlanta City Councilman H. Lamar Willis has criticized the extension of the toll. If the toll must be continued, he would prefer using at least some of the money collected to fund regional transportation. Willis' proposal stems from the longtime lament among some leaders from Atlanta and DeKalb and Fulton counties that they contribute money from a 1 percent sales tax on most goods to help pay for MARTA but other counties do not, although some of their residents use the rail and bus system.

Willis, a member of the council's transportation committee, calls extending the toll a ""flip-flop.""

""We should never go back on a promise we made to our citizenry,"" the councilman said.

Our Flip-o-Meter defines a Full Flop as ""a complete change in position."" This vote, we believe, falls into this category. This is a Full Flop if ever there was one.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB0D0C0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/28/georgia-state-road-and-tollway-authority/road-authority-reverses-course-ga-400-toll/
"['National', 'Education', 'Federal Budget', 'This Week - ABC News', 'David Axelrod']","
David Axelrod says GOP ""Pledge"" would cut education by 20 percent, ""slash"" student aid for 8 million
","
Just days after House Republicans released a governing blueprint called ""A Pledge to America,"" the White House took aim at the GOP platform. Speaking on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Sept. 26, 2010, David Axelrod, one of President Barack Obama's top advisers, zeroed in on the Republican plan for education. 
""When you look at that Pledge to America, it is a complete echo of what was done before,"" Axelrod said. ""It would borrow $700 billion to cut taxes for the very wealthy, add trillions of dollars to the deficits. It would unleash the special interests to be writing rules here on Capitol Hill again. And it would cut things like -- there's a 20 percent cut in there for education. We're talking about our economy. Education is the defense budget of the -- economic defense budget of the 21st century, and they're basically talking about disarmament. Eight million kids would have their college aid slashed under this budget. This isn't a prescription for economic growth; this is a prescription for surrender. We can't do that."" 
We thought we'd check whether the House GOP really intends to cut education funding by 20 percent and whether 8 million students would see their aid ""slashed."" 
First, Axelrod wrongly said on This Week that the 20 percent cut comes from the GOP's ""Pledge"" document. Actually, that document doesn't address education policy --  there's not a single word in the 48-page document about education. 
When we mentioned this to the White House, a spokeswoman clarified that Axelrod's argument stemmed instead from a Sept. 8, 2010, proposal by House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, that Congress cut non-security-related discretionary spending to its fiscal year 2008 level. Boehner stood behind both the Pledge and the proposed discretionary spending cut, so we don't think it's misleading for Axelrod to link House Republicans to the discretionary spending cut. 
The White House also told us that Axelrod relied on an analysis of the Boehner proposal produced by the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. This report said the Boehner proposal would result in a ""21 percent cut in K-12 education funding would take more than $8 billion out of this area in fiscal year 2011."" 
So let's look at how the Education Department budget would look if the Republican proposal took effect. Axelrod wasn't specific about which budget years he was comparing, so we'll offer three figures for the Education Department's proposed discretionary budget: 
Fiscal year 2011 (estimated): $49.7 million 
Fiscal year 2010 (estimated): $46.8 million 
Fiscal year 2008 (enacted): $37.9 million 
So, the Republican plan would cut the budget by 19 percent from its 2010 level and by 24 percent from its proposed 2011 level. So, Axelrod is in the correct range. We're prepared to offer him some leeway because the math is complicated by quirks in how budget items are categorized and by inconsistencies in how budget tables over the period are constructed. 
When we ran the White House's approach by Boehner's office, a spokesman said that they're based on a faulty assumption -- that the Boehner proposal would institute identical, across-the-board cuts for every department and program. In fact, the spokesman said, the proposal would be to set the entire discretionary budget to 2008 levels and then negotiate cuts in each program to meet that target. 
That's all well and good, but the fact is that Boehner's news release doesn't explain exactly how its cuts would be made. So, given the information available, we think it's reasonable for Axelrod to have based his claim on an across-the-board cut. Moreover, if Boehner's office is suggesting that under his proposal, the cuts in education could in fact be less than 20 percent, then by the same logic they could also end up higher than 20 percent. 
Ultimately, Axelrod wrongly attributes that to the Pledge, but he is right that Boehner has made such a proposal, and Axelrod's assumptions are reasonable. 
Now, on to the second claim -- that ""eight million kids would have their college aid slashed under this budget."" 
This claim is also tricky to evaluate, since there are several types of student loans and grants under the Education Department budget, some of which are considered discretionary spending (meaning they'd be subject to Boehner's proposed cut) and some of which are considered mandatory spending (which would not be subject to his cut). But we'll try our best to sort it out. 
There are four major types of discretionary student aid: Pell grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity grants, federal work-study grants and federal Perkins loans. If you add together the recipients of these four grants, the total is 10.9 million for fiscal year 2010 and 12 million for 2011. That would actually be more students than Axelrod suggests, but experts told us that these numbers could be inflated by students whose aid packages include funds from two or more of these programs. So Axelrod's 8,000 figure -- which happens to be the ballpark number of Pell grants, the largest of the four programs -- seems reasonable to us. 
One final question is whether it's fair to use the word ""slashed"" to describe a roughly 20 percent cut. We think a 20 percent cut is deep enough to justify that term. 
So where does this leave us? We'll grant that Boehner's camp has a right to dispute Axelrod's suggestion that the Pledge outlined a 20 percent cut. That document itself didn't mention education, but Boehner outlined a 20 percent cut. He never specified that it would be other than across the board until we contacted his office, so we think it's reasonable for Axelrod to conclude that education would be cut in line with the rest of federal agencies. Meanwhile, the percentage cut and the student aid recipient numbers that Axelrod cited strike us as fair estimates, given the complexities of calculating year-to-year budgetary numbers for federal agencies. On balance, we rate Axelrod's comment Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA10100>],/factchecks/2010/sep/27/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-says-gop-pledge-would-cut-education-/
"['Medicare', 'Florida', 'George Pataki']","

George Pataki says Florida seniors get 'Gator Aid' to protect their Medicare Advantage
","
Did Florida seniors get a deal dubbed ""Gator Aid"" that protected their Medicare Advantage unlike the rest of the nation?

That's the case, according to former New York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, who is now chairman of Revere America, an organization that aims to repeal the health care bill. Pataki announced his campaign to target members of Congress who voted for the bill at a Sept. 8 press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.

Here is the full context of what Pataki said about Medicare Advantage and Florida around minute 9:25 on the video:

""In addition, there are a lot of lawsuits out there. Attorney General McCollum in Florida has one on behalf of Florida and other states. And Revere America will be involved in a lawsuit being brought by the lieutenant governor of Missouri, which is very interesting because it's not government-versus-government; it's based on some of the corrupt deals in this bill -- in this case, the fact that if you're a senior citizen on Medicare Advantage, you will lose in the overwhelming number of cases that ability to have Medicare Advantage, unless you live in the state of Florida, because they made a corrupt deal for a Florida vote, so that Florida seniors are exempt. And we believe that is an unconstitutional denial of equal protection.""

For this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to check: Are Florida seniors exempt from losing Medicare Advantage?

First, some background on Medicare Advantage.

A Dec. 23, 2009, Truth-O-Meter item about Medicare Advantage explained it this way: 
""Medicare Advantage is an optional program that lets Medicare recipients 65 and older receive their benefits through private health insurance plans, instead of through the traditional Medicare program. The idea behind the program was to save the government money, but it hasn't worked out that way.

""Under the program, the government pays Advantage companies a set amount per enrollee, about $10,000, and they make a profit if they keep average costs below that level. The reimbursement amounts to about 14 percent more, on average, than the government spends on a traditional Medicare beneficiary.

""The extra money allows companies to offer Medicare Advantage members additional services, such as prescription drug, vision and dental coverage at a much lower cost, as well as other perks like gym memberships. About 11 million people are enrolled in the program nationwide."" 
According to a September 2010 fact-sheet about Medicare Advantage from the Kaiser Family Foundation, the health reform law ""reduces federal payments to Medicare Advantage plans over time, bringing them closer to the average costs of care under the fee-for-service Medicare program."" About 24 percent of the 47 million people enrolled in Medicare are on Medicare Advantage, according to Kaiser.

The December 2009 PolitiFact provides us with background regarding an initial plan that would have helped Florida seniors on Medicare Advantage. But remember, that Truth-O-Meter item was written before the final version of the bill passed in March 2010.

That PolitFact report examined a claim by Karl Rove that U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat of Florida, got a ""$25 billion to $30 billion carve-out for Medicare Advantage patients,"" for Florida. Rove, a former adviser to President George W. Bush, said on Fox News: ""Every Medicare Advantage policyholder in America, except those in Florida, will see a huge cut in the federal support for those policies, and as a result, a dramatic decline in their benefits and an increase in their premiums, except if you live in Florida."" We ruled that comment by Rove Barely True.

Nelson had initially sought to grandfather in all seniors on Medicare Advantage at the time, said Nelson spokesman Bryan Gulley. But the Senate said that was too expensive so Nelson proposed an amendment that protected Medicare Advantage for seniors who lived in areas where services cost the highest. But the bill itself didn't mention Florida -- it was based on a formula and would have benefitted a few states. The previous PolitiFact quoted a spokesman for Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., as saying that the protection would help seniors in their states, too.

Nelson's amendment, part of the broader health care bill, passed the Senate in December 2009 and the House in March. But it was changed in the reconciliation bill -- the final bill President Barack Obama signed into law.

Under the president's plan, Gulley said, ""Florida would not benefit over anybody else ... because the cuts were more evenly spread across the whole country, meaning that seniors in states like Florida wouldn't be unfairly penalized.""

We asked Gulley to send us the provision in the bill that passed with Nelson's language and the final version, which cut it. Note that HR 3590, which was approved by the House and Senate and includes Section 3201 on Medicare Advantage Payment, doesn't state ""Florida"" but includes a series of formulas. HR 4872, the reconciliation bill, includes the following language in Section 1102:

""a) Repeal- Effective as if included in the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sections 3201 and 3203 of such Act (and the amendments made by such sections) are repealed.""

A March 28, 2010, article in the Miami Herald stated that Nelson ""successfully amended an early version of the health care bill to soften cuts to Medicare Advantage, a privatized Medicare program. But the amendment was killed after Republicans denigrated it as a backroom deal for Florida that was nicknamed 'Gator Aid.' ""

We contacted Pataki spokesman David Catalfamo Sept. 16. He sent us this:

""Section 3201 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as 'PPACA,' or 'Obamacare' (as amended by H.R. 4872, Sec. 1102) reduces Medicare Part C ('Medicare Advantage') supplemental coverage for most Americans by eliminating the Medicare Advantage Stabilization Fund. This process begins on January 1, 2011, by freezing payments at 2010 levels. Medicare supplemental coverage reimbursements are then reduced to an unsustainable level beginning in 2012. This prohibition on Medicare Advantage supplemental coverage applies to all U.S. citizens, except individuals living in certain qualifying Florida counties described in Section 3201(c)(3)(B) of PPACA. This is the provision that it opponents labeled 'Gator Aid.' ""

We asked Catalfamo if he was quoting from a document or if this was his own analysis. And we summarized for him what we had learned from Nelson's office and asked him to point to a specific section in the final bill that included an exemption for Florida. On Sept. 20, he sent us this response and attached bills: 
""The exact 'Gator Aid' provision that was in the first bill was removed when the House reconciliation bill was passed, and replaced with a provision that did the same thing, but did not name counties outright and instead provided very narrow criteria to isolate certain counties in Florida and 2 counties in other states."" Then he sent us links to the bills.

We asked Catalfamo on Sept. 20 to allow us to speak directly to his policy expert providing the information on Medicare to point us to the specific provision in the final bill that would provide a unique benefit to Florida. A week later, we had not heard from anyone willing to speak on the record.

We reached three experts about Medicare Advantage who disputed Pataki's claim. Our sources: Brian Biles, a professor in the Department of Health Policy at George Washington University; Marc Steinberg, deputy director of health policy at Families USA, a nonprofit health consumer organization; and Peter Ashkenaz, a spokesperson for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Steinberg put it the most bluntly:

""I really think they are 100 percent wrong,'' he said.

Congress is scaling back the payments to Medicare Advantage plans to bring them more in line on average to what is paid in Medicare. But it's too soon to say what that means for the average senior in various parts of the country while the reductions are being phased in over a few years. It's possible some Medicare Advantage providers will get out of the business, cut services or increase costs, he said.

The change in the payment formulas isn't flat across the country -- it takes into account geographic differences, Steinberg said. For example, the payment rates to health care companies will be scaled back more in counties that were well above the Medicare average while counties that were below the Medicare average could see the health care providers receive higher reimbursements. That means that some Florida seniors could see a reduction in benefits to their plans, Steinberg said.

""I think it's really a misreading of the law,'' Steinberg said. ""It doesn't seem to understand what Medicare Advantage is or how the new payment formula works and it really misinterprets the geographic adjustment.""

Biles, who co-wrote a paper on Medicare Advantage comparing costs in various states including Florida, said in an interview ""in the final bill again some of the South Florida counties are paid among the lowest amounts relative to fee for service of any counties in the country."" In fact, Biles' paper shows that in 2009, the level of Medicare Advantage payments in Florida had been 103 percent of the payments to the traditional fee-for-service costs, while the national average was higher at 113 percent. Under the new payment plan, Florida Medicare Advantage providers will be paid 94 percent of traditional Medicare, still lower than the national average of 101 percent. 
Biles said in an e-mail that ""Florida was never a significant part of the extra payment to MA plans problem."" Nonetheless, he said, some plans in South Florida under the new law will be paid a lower percentage of traditional Medicare ""than any plans anywhere in the nation at any time in the 25-year history of the Medicare private plan program."" That's not exactly a sweet ""Gator-Aid"" drink for Florida seniors. 
Ashkenaz, after reading Pataki's claim, responded in an email: ""there is nothing in the Affordable Care Act that impacts MA (Medicare Advantage) in this way.""

Let's review: Does ""Gator-Aid"" exist in the form of a special deal for Florida seniors and Medicare Advantage? U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson's spokesman said that Nelson tried to get a break for a few high-cost areas including parts of Florida, but that provision was repealed in the final version of the law. The experts we spoke to are adamant and unanimous that Pataki's description is wrong. We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB0D340>],/factchecks/2010/sep/27/george-pataki/george-pataki-says-florida-seniors-get-gator-aid-p/
"['Economy', 'Stimulus', 'Florida', 'Steve Southerland']","
Steve Southerland says Allen Boyd's North Florida district has lost 6,000 jobs since August 2009
","
Locked in a competitive race for a North Florida Congressional seat, Republican Steve Southerland is highlighting unemployment statistics to say the district is hemorrhaging jobs.

On Sept. 17, 2010, Southerland issued a press release entitled ""Southerland calls for leadership on job creation."" The release was in response to an Agency for Workforce Innovation jobs report detailing August 2010 unemployment figures. The report found that statewide, the unemployment rate rose .2 percent since July, from 11.5 percent to 11.7 percent.

Southerland, a funeral-home owner, seized on the figures as a way to criticize his Democratic opponent, incumbent U.S. Rep. Allen Boyd.

""Allen Boyd voted for the reckless $787 billion stimulus giveaway with an assurance that his vote would create Second District jobs,"" Southerland said in the release. ""Over the past year, however, our 16 counties have hemorrhaged more than 6,000 jobs with no apparent end in sight. As an experienced small businessman, I am prepared to lead where Allen Boyd has failed. I will fight to create permanent new jobs in Florida and restore common sense economic policy in Washington.""

Southerland is right that Boyd voted for the 2009 stimulus.

But he has his jobs number wrong.

Let us explain.

The Agency for Workforce Innovation report included county-by-county employment statistics for August 2010, July 2010 and August 2009. For each time period, the report measured the size of the labor force, the number of people employed and the number of people unemployed. The report then calculated an unemployment rate.

We gathered the relevant statistics for the 16 counties that make up the 2nd District -- Dixie, Lafayette, Suwanne, Taylor, Jefferson, Leon, Gadsden, Wakulla, Franklin, Liberty, Gulf, Calhoun, Jackson, Bay, Okaloosa, Walton -- to run our own calculations. Here's what we found:

From 2009 to 2010, the labor force (i.e. the people available to work) grew in the 16-county area from 497,407 to 501,650. That's an extra 4,243 available to work.

In the same time period, the number of employed people shrank from 457,896 to 456,089 -- a drop of 1,807 people.

Lastly, the number of unemployed people grew from 39,511 to 45,561, an increase of 6,050.

We'll save you some of the mental math gymnastics and tell you that if you add the number of employed people (the second set of numbers) to the number of unemployed people (the third set of numbers), you get the labor force for the 16-county area (the first set of numbers).

Why does this all matter?

Southerland in his statement is saying the 16 counties that make up the 2nd District lost more than 6,000 jobs. It's true that about 6,000 more people were unemployed in August 2010 than August 2009 (6,050 to be exact), but the district hasn't lost near that many jobs. In the same time period, 1,807 less people are employed -- meaning that 1,807 jobs were lost.

That is, of course, a significant number, but it's way lower than what Southerland claimed.

We ran the figures and Southerland's statement by Robert Barro, the Paul M. Warburg Professor of Economics at Harvard University. He agreed that ""lost jobs"" should equal the change in the number employed, not the change in the number of unemployed.

We rate Southerland's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB872100>],/factchecks/2010/sep/27/steve-southerland/steve-southerland-says-allen-boyds-north-florida-d/
"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Rob Portman']","
Portman raps Lee Fisher and administration, saying Ohio is losing jobs to other states
","
Rob Portman makes a unique bogeyman for his opponent : He’s a Republican who not only supported foreign trade policies, which his foes blame for Ohio job losses, but he also personally advised a president on expanding trade. He  personifies the policy.

Yet Portman, a Republican running for U.S. Senate, has a uniquely good comeback.

He says that while many companies have survived thanks to the export opportunities of foreign trade, Ohio lost lots of other jobs to other states on the watch of his opponent, Lee Fisher -- the irony being that Fisher, a Democrat  and Ohio’s lieutenant governor, was also Ohio’s development director, in charge of bringing new jobs to the state.

It’s a blame game with resumes perfectly tailored for the respective attacks. But who’s more to blame for Ohio’s job losses? The guy who promoted trade with China and Mexico and saw jobs cross those borders? Or the guy who as Ohio development director saw too much development cross state borders, not international ones?   
Portman, appearing with Fisher before The Plain Dealer editorial board on Sept. 14, said that if you want to compare the validity of these opposing claims, data from the state backs up his: more jobs went to other states than went abroad.

""It may surprise you to learn that when you look at the state’s own data in terms of job loss, that almost nine out of 10 jobs we have lost in the last three and a half years during the Strickland-Fisher administration have gone to other states, not to other countries,"" Portman said, referring to Fisher and Gov. Ted Strickland. ""Think about that. So companies have left Cleveland to go to Indiana. Companies have left Cleveland to go across the border to Michigan. And yet it’s easy in a campaign to fan the flames of protectionism"" and to claim that the jobs went to ""Mexico or Canada or, more likely, China.""

We asked about that data, went to the state’s website to see for ourselves, and laid it out in an Excel file. What we saw, however, were alternate versions of the same reality -- one that supports Portman and yet simultaneously presents as many holes as aged Emmental cheese.

So before we put this to the Truth-O-Meter, let us show you the numbers, starting with Portman’s view of them.

The ""state’s own data"" comes from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, or ODJFS. In concert with the U.S. Department of Labor, ODJFS publishes quarterly reports of ""Mass Layoff Events,"" based on surveys of companies with 50 or more initial unemployment claims filed within a five-week period. The surveys, conducted by telephone, ask why the layoffs occurred and whether they were associated with jobs being moved from one place to another. If so, the survey asks where these jobs went: Somewhere else in Ohio? Some other state? Some other country?

Reviewing these quarterly reports, we found missing numbers and an error the state had made. After we discussed this with ODJFS, the agency went back and updated one quarterly set of numbers. That changed the outcome of the tally, but only slightly. Because Portman relied on the old data, we will still use the old data to evaluate his claim.

From January 2007 through March of 2010, 842 jobs were lost in Ohio because companies moved operations overseas, the old reports showed. That’s a small number compared with the 5,215 jobs lost in Ohio because companies moved their operations to other states, as the state data showed.

Put another way, it means that of the jobs that left Ohio, only 13.9 percent went overseas -- and 86 percent went to other states. Now consider Portman’s words: The state’s ""own data"" shows that ""almost nine out of ten jobs we have lost in the last three and a half years during the Strickland-Fisher administration have gone to other states, not to other countries.""

Eighty-six percent is close enough to nine out of ten. So Portman is right -- yes?

Well, yes -- except for the caveats. Let’s start with those from the state. ODJFS quarterly  reports note that employers with fewer than 50 workers are not part of the surveys, so these numbers do not include small companies. That exclusion partly explains why the total number of lost jobs counted in these Ohio quarterly reports -- 264,016 since January 2007,  including the vast majority that had little to do with the movement of work -- is lower than you’ll see in other reports of job losses.

Then there’s the U.S. Department of Labor, whose Bureau of Labor Statistics sets the survey standards and points out that ""movement of work"" is defined as work that will be performed by a company or for a company in a new location. Movement is easy to report when a company shutters one plant and reopens another, whether in Juarez, Mexico, or Kokomo, Ind. The definition also applies if a company signs a contract to have its widgets manufactured in Shanghai, China. These are hypothetical examples, because the state reports do not give  the exact place of relocation. 
But if a large company with a big supply chain starts using a widget supplier in Mexico and stops buying from a supplier in Ohio, and that Ohio supplier loses so much revenue that it shuts down, those lost jobs are not counted in the ""movement of work"" column. Those jobs, then, do not wind up in Portman’s comparison.

That’s the biggest problem. 
We asked Policy Matters Ohio, a think tank, for its latest report on trade adjustment assistance, or TAA, a federal assistance program for workers displaced because of foreign trade. In 2009, 20,677 Ohio workers were deemed potentially eligible for the program, and 9,455 more were in 2008, according to TAA certification reports reviewed by Policy Matters. That suggests that job losses from trade were massively higher than those attributable to companies moving out of state.

But some of those workers eligible for TAA wound up keeping their jobs or getting rehired, such as when General Motors’ Lordstown plant began rehiring. Others found work elsewhere; a precise number does not exist, which presents a problem for all of these comparisons. Everyone is talking about fruit, but they’re often comparing apples with persimmons.

PolitiFact Ohio has previously examined claims by Strickland and Fisher that trade deals cost specific numbers of job losses in Ohio. We have found trend lines that appear believable, but the reports and statistics the officials cite rely on extrapolations or suppositions. Someday the comparative data may exist; until then, each side in this debate simply argues a point that sounds as if it could be true -- and certainly rings true to those affected -- but that lacks the accuracy that advocates suggest when they trot out their numbers.

So we return to Portman’s claim. Portman’s spokeswoman, Jessica Towhey, says the candidate made clear that he was referring solely to state data and the movement of jobs out of state, compared with those moved out of the country, when he said that nine out of 10 jobs lost in Ohio went to other states, not other countries. In such a narrow construct, Portman’s statement might be considered accurate but there is more to this picture. Here are the numbers as updated: From Jan. 1, 2007, through March 31, 2010, Ohio lost 4,820 jobs due to company moves out of state (not the 5,215 in the reports that existed when Portman viewed them). It lost 1,125 more when companies closed operations in one part of the state but relocated elsewhere in Ohio. And it lost 842 jobs when companies moved operations abroad.

This is out of 264,016 jobs counted as lost altogether in this particular series of reports -- reports that ODJFS spokesman Ben Johnson say capture just ""a subset"" of all layoffs.

When a statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, the Truth-O-Meter says it is mostly true. That’s how we find Portman’s claim: accurate in a narrow context but needing clarification, and so, Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECACA080>],/factchecks/2010/sep/27/rob-portman/portman-raps-lee-fisher-and-administration-saying-/

Jack Conway campaign ad accuses Rand Paul of being soft on crime
","
Accusing your opponent of being soft on crime is pretty standard campaign fare, but Kentucky Democrat Jack Conway -- a candidate for U.S. Senate -- takes things one step further in a campaign video, using a two-year-old quote from Republican opponent Rand Paul to suggest Paul wants to decriminalize everything from drug dealing and burglary to prostitution.

The ad begins with a clip of the Paul quote in question: ""The things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law.""

It then cuts to an image of Bernie Madoff with the question, ""Should Wall Street Fraudster Bernie Madoff not be in jail?""

A uniformed law enforcement officer then asks, ""What about meth and drug dealers?""

Cut to another officer...""theft, burglary...promoting prostitution...""

And then back to Paul saying, ""The things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law.""

Another version of the Conway ad follows the same theme.

""Thinks non-violent crime should be against the law? That's crazy,"" one uniformed officer says.

""It should be a crime if you sells drugs to a minor,"" says another cop.

Then others...""...Wall Street fraud. Mortgage fraud...burglary...someone that's promoting prostitution...theft.""

The implication is clear: Paul wants to legalize all non-violent crime, including drug dealing, theft, burglary and prostitution.

On the campaign trail, Paul has repeatedly denounced the ad, and his campaign promptly put out a press release boasting that a number of county sheriffs had publicly declared their support for his campaign.

""I think it's a dishonest ad, would be the first thing I'd say,"" Paul said in a Sept. 16, 2010, interview on Fox41 in Kentucky. ""What we were discussing a couple years ago on KET was whether or not things like motorcycle helmets and the lottery should be illegal because they’re immoral or because they're unsafe. And my point was that there are certain things adults can make decisions on.

""What that ad does is, he totally distorts it and wants to say I want to allow minors to use drugs, it is an absolute falsehood.""

Paul went even further in a Fox News interview on Sept. 19, 2010, calling the ad ""a lie.""

Paul again explained that he was a pundit panelist on a program called Kentucky Tonight on Nov. 24, 2008, and that the context of the discussion was not crime at all, but rather was ""about helmet laws for adults and whether adults should have the right to either gamble or buy lottery tickets. And the comparison between lottery tickets and gambling. And it really had nothing to do with drugs or drugs for minors, or all these things, prostitution...""

""So,"" the interviewer interjected, ""you think those things should be illegal, Dr. Paul?""

""Yes,"" Paul said. ""And I'm not proposing any changes in the drug laws or laws against prostitution.""

We listened to the entirety of the Kentucky Tonight program on the night in question, and Paul is correct that the focus was on whether the state ought to place higher taxes on things like cigarettes or alcohol. Paul made it clear he didn't think that was the government's place.

""Do we want our tax commissioner to be the moral commissioner of sin?"" Paul said on the program.

""Where does it stop?"" Paul said, throwing out the example of whether the government ought to put an extra $1 tax on a McDonald's quarter pounder to help curb obesity.

""It really isn't our job to tell people whether they should smoke or not,"" Paul said. ""It's not our job to tell people whether they should eat too much or not. We're a free society where individuals can decide what they want to decide.""

In the course of the discussion, Paul talked about whether the government should regulate whether someone should be able to ride a bike or motorcycle without a helmet. And what about gambling? he asked, noting that, ""It's OK to gamble on the lottery, just not slot machines.""

""I'm against legislating morality,"" Paul said. ""I mean, I'm for crimes and having laws against things that are violent crimes. But things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law.""

So there's the fuller context.

John Collins, a spokesman for the Conway campaign, said Paul's words speak for themselves.

""Rand Paul believes drugs aren't a pressing issue and that non-violent crimes, such as prostitution and selling drugs, shouldn’t be against the law,"" Collins said. ""If Paul thinks that’s misleading, then he should not have said it. Simply put, you could hold a meeting of all the people who agree with Rand Paul’s soft on crime beliefs in a phone booth.""

We asked Collins for evidence to support the claim that Paul believes selling drugs, for example, shouldn't be against the law.

He pointed us to a series of quotes in which Paul espouses the opinion that issues of crime are better addressed at the state and local, rather than federal, government level. So, for example, he has said that issues like whether to legalize medical marijuana ought to be decided by states, and that the funding for drug enforcement ought to come from state and local governments. Those may be controversial positions, but they are a far cry from Paul saying he believes that drug dealing and burglary ought not to be against the law.

We asked Collins if he could point us toward any other quotes from Paul that suggest he doesn't think drug dealing, burglary and prostitution, for example, should not be against the law.

He referred us only to Paul's two-year-old quote, ""The things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law.""

Certainly Paul could have chosen his words more carefully. But this strikes us as more of a political ""gotcha"" than a legitimate issue. The quote comes in the context of Paul discussing the propriety of government involvement in issues such as cigarette or alcohol taxes, gambling and wearing a motorcycle helmet.

Paul said what he said. But for the Conway campaign to splice that with comments from law enforcement officials listing non-violent crime such as dealing drugs to kids, promoting prostitution, theft, burglary and financial crime suggests Paul wants to decriminalize those acts. We couldn't find a single instance where Paul has said he specifically wanted to legalize any of those activities. Conversely, Paul has repeatedly and unequivocally said he does not want to make those things legal, and that he has no plans to change the current laws with regard to them. We think a reasonable person can see what's going on here.

Americans for Job Security targets Zack Space, other Dems on their agenda
","
A new political ad shows a burglar climbing into a window, taking someone's wallet, and driving off in their car.

""What would it feel like if someone broke into your home?"" The narrator asks. ""Would you be upset? Then what about what's happening in Washington? Zack Space voted for Nancy Pelosi's budgets and debt, for job-killing energy taxes, and for her wasteful stimulus. And we still lost more than 2.5 million jobs. With Pelosi and Space's agenda, it can feel like you're getting robbed. This November, vote against Zack Space.""

The ad comes from Americans for Job Security, a conservative anti-tax group. The group does not disclose its donors, and that has led to questions about who funds the group and for what purposes. The ad, called ""Robbed,"" is part of an ad buy against several Democratic candidates around the country. The ad targets Space of Ohio, Pennsylvania Rep. Jason Altmire and Democratic challengers Bryan Lentz of Pennsylvania and Trent Van Haaften of Indiana. For Lentz and Van Haaften, the ad says that each candidate ""wants to join Nancy Pelosi,"" and then lists the measures as  ""Pelosi's agenda.""

The ad mentions major pieces of legislation passed by Democrats in Congress and labels them a failure because ""we still lost more than 2.5 million jobs."" Take away the scary robber imagery, and it's a fairly straightforward claim.

We decided to fact-check the ad for Space, who represents eastern Ohio and is a member of the Blue Dog coalition, a group of fiscally conservative Democrats. We'll take the ads' claims about him in order.

• Space ""voted for budgets and debt.""

Space did vote for the 2010 budget, a vote that in the U.S. House of Representatives was mostly along party lines, 233-193. (Seventeen Democrats voted with Republicans in opposition.)

One might argue that the budget is more President Barack Obama's than Nancy Pelosi's -- the president proposes the budget, and Congress votes on it. But Pelosi, as speaker of the House, leads the Democrats, who overwhelmingly approved the budget.

But the ad gets it wrong on Space's vote on ""debt."" Here, the ad cites a vote from December 2009 that permitted the national debt limit to increase from $12.1 trillion to $12.39 trillion. The vote in this case was 218 to 214, with 39 Democrats joining all the Republicans.

In this case, Space voted with the Republicans and against raising the debt limit. So the ad gets this point wrong. 
• Space voted for ""job-killing energy taxes.""

This is Americans for Job Security's way of saying that Space voted for major energy legislation (Republicans lately have been fond of putting ""job-killing"" in front of many things the Democrats support.) But as we've pointed out before, the legislation was for a cap-and-trade system, not an energy tax.

At its heart, cap-and-trade is a simple concept: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. Presumably, the costs associated with that end up getting passed on to consumers.

PolitiFact Ohio looked into this issue previously, when Republican candidate Bob Gibbs attacked Space for voting for the legislation, saying the measure would cost the average household ""approximately $1,761 per year in increased energy rates."" We found that number to be a wild exaggeration, based on estimates that were not part of the bill that Space voted for. We rated that statement Pants on Fire. And whether the measure is job-killing is also a contested issue. Some say it will actually create jobs, and there's a lively debate on the issue. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that employment rates would be ""slightly lower"" if cap-and-trade passes.

Here, we'll note that Space did vote for the cap-and-trade legislation, but calling it a ""energy tax"" is not an accurate way to describe the measure. 
• Space voted for a ""wasteful stimulus.""

Again, Space did vote in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, popularly known as the economic stimulus. Whether it was ""wasteful"" is still a matter for debate at this point. (We've done many fact-checks on the stimulus, read them all here.)

We should point out that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released new estimates on Aug. 24, 2010, that the stimulus added between 1.4 million and 3.3 million jobs to the economy, compared with not having any stimulus. Still, the economy was in such bad shape that overall employment declined anyway, as we'll see in the next point.

• ""And we still lost more than 2.5 million jobs.""

To check this jobs number, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a division of the U.S. Department of Labor. Given the ad's content, we think it's fair to start counting from about the time the stimulus passed to today. There are several different ways to calculate employment numbers, so we decided to look at two measures. Both supported the ads' claim.

First, we looked at total employment, the number of workers in the United States. It was 132.8 million in February 2009, and 130.4 million in June 2010. (June is the most recent month with final numbers; data for July and August are still preliminary.) That's a difference of 2.4 million workers, very close to the ad's statement.

If you look at only private employment, there were 110.3 million people employed in February 2009 and 107.7 million employed in June 2010. That's a difference of 2.6 million people.

So the ad's claim on jobs lost since the Democrats passed their legislation is accurate.

In deciding upon a Truth-O-Meter ruling for this ad, we had a lot to consider on the many different points the ad raises. The ad's bottom line is that the Democrats passed legislation that Space voted for, and overall employment still declined. But the ad gets some of its details wrong, most notably Space's vote on increasing the debt ceiling. That point is flat-out wrong. The ad also mischaracterizes cap-and-and trade legislation as an energy tax. Space did vote for cap-and-trade, the 2010 budget and the stimulus. Given the ad's inaccuracies, we rate its statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE196C0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/27/americans-job-security/americans-job-security-targets-zach-space-other-de/
"['Message Machine 2010', 'Social Security', 'Wisconsin', 'Steve Kagen']","
U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen says opponent Reid Ribble wants to phase out Social Security
","
Like many contested congressional races, the future of Social Security is a key issue in the battle for the 8th District seat now held by two-term U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen, D-Wisconsin.

In many races, the accusation is that a candidate wants to privatize Social Security.

But does anyone want end it all together?

Kagen says his opponent, Republican Reid Ribble, does.

A new Kagen television ad opens with comical music, black-and-white newsreel-style footage and an announcer saying, ""Some things are just bad ideas."" The ad soon shifts to Social Security, with these words -- ""Politician Reid Ribble hurting Wisconsin seniors"" -- next to the requisite image of a white-haired grandmother. It then includes a video snippet of Ribble saying: ""Somehow we have to establish a phase-out of the current Social Security system.""

The conclusion: ""Tell Republican Reid Ribble to keep his hands off our Social Security.""

Social Security is a common election-year theme, and 2010 is no different.

President Barack Obama has led Democratic attacks. PolitiFact’s national site rounds up more than two dozen Social Security-related claims, many of which it deemed dubious. In Wisconsin’s 7th U.S. House District, we rated a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee TV ad saying Republican Sean Duffy wanted to privatize Social Security as Pants on Fire.

The DCCC also weighed in against Ribble, in part because the district -- covering the Fox Valley -- is a swing seat. In a news release, the DCCC uses language similar to Kagen, saying Ribble would ""dismantle Social Security and take away the guaranteed retirement benefits"" of seniors.

So, what of Steve Kagen’s TV ad?

We asked Kagen campaign spokeswoman Allison Jaslow to elaborate on the charge against Ribble, but she did not get back to us. PolitiFact Wisconsin also asked for an interview with Kagen, but he did not respond.

That leaves us with the ad itself, which includes no footnotes or backup for the statement other than the video of Ribble himself.

The footage of Ribble is from a campaign forum held Nov. 3, 2009 by the Fox Valley Initiative, a tea party group. Ribble did speak the 14 words in question -- and many more than that. The video actually cuts him off mid-sentence.

Here is what Ribble actually said, based on a longer video of the same statement posted on YouTube. We’ll highlight where the new words pick up.

""Somehow we have to establish a phase-out of the current Social Security system to a new system. And that will have to happen over time. It could happen in a single generation.""

Ribble goes on to discuss how the life expectancy of  Americans has grown since Social Security was established in the 1930s, and its effect on the system.

""It has to change,"" Ribble said of Social Security. ""It will bankrupt this country if it doesn’t change.""

That’s a far cry from getting rid of Social Security.

In an interview, Ribble said he favors a system of ""personal accounts"" that are linked to the individuals. ""The government can’t take that money from you and give it to somebody else,"" he said. Ribble said he has been consistent in his statements about Social Security. ""We’ve made promises to our seniors and we have to keep them.""

Ribble said he is ""uncomfortable with privatization"" but favors ""personalization of the system but within Social Security."" He said he did not have any ""hard and fast numbers"" about how this would be accomplished -- or how it would stabilize Social Security finances.

Our search of the Internet could find no public statements by Ribble that contradict this statement. Though he survived a four-way primary, Ribble is a first-time candidate and has run a, well, lean campaign. His pre-primary campaign finance report showed about $71,000 on hand.

That brings us to Kagen’s labeling of Ribble as a ""politician.""

Ribble has never run for office before -- not even student council student, he joked.

""I’ve been in the construction industry my entire life,"" said Ribble, who sold his family-owned commercial roofing business to a relative in December.

Ribble is on the ballot and running now. But it’s the same situation Kagen -- an allergist by trade -- was in when he ran in 2006 and told voters he was not a politician.

So, let’s recap what we know.

To make his case that Reid Ribble wants to ""phase out"" Social Security, Kagen lifts a choice 14 words from a 2009 forum. Snipped out: The fact Ribble immediately goes on to say he is worried about the future of Social Security and believes the current system will need to be replaced or modified. Kagen’s statement splices and dices -- and leaves the truth on the cutting room floor. Strike another match. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAE4BC0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/27/steve-kagen/us-rep-steve-kagen-says-opponent-reid-ribble-wants/
"['Abortion', 'Texas', 'John Cornyn']","
Sen. John Cornyn says that the annual defense authorization bill includes language that would require military hospitals to provide abortions ""on demand""
","
Republican senators, including John Cornyn of Texas, last week charged Democrats with tacking politically-loaded amendments onto a defense bill. 
In a Sept. 21 press release announcing his decision to vote against a motion to take up the bill, Cornyn accused the body's majority party of attaching ""language to the bill that represents a blatant attempt to score last-minute votes just weeks before an election. The bill includes language that would require military hospitals to provide abortions on demand."" 
The motion failed after a 56-43 vote that same day. We wondered later if indeed language attached by Democrats would require military hospitals to provide abortions ""on demand."" 
First, some background: The Department of Defense is barred from spending federal funds to perform abortions except when the life of the mother is in danger. The only other instances that abortions can be performed in military facilities are in cases of rape or incest, though the woman must pay for the procedure herself. 
In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed a memorandum allowing abortions at military facilities if they were paid for with private funds, according to a 2002 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. In 1996, Republicans, who then controlled Congress, imposed the current limits, in that year's version of the defense authorization bill. It has stood ever since. 
The law affects some 200,000 active-duty female personnel, according to the nonpartisan Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health. Heather Boonstra, a senior policy analyst at the Institute, told us that about 50,000 servicewomen are stationed overseas.   
How did the new language per the abortion limits emerge? 
In May, Sen. Roland Burris, D-Ill., introduced an amendment to the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2011. Burris' amendment, adopted by a Senate committee, would repeal the restrictions on privately-funded abortions in military facilities. Burris said in a May 27 press release: ""It is critical that we provide the highest quality care for our service members while they are serving our nation overseas, and that includes allowing women and their families the right to choose at facilities operated under the Department of Defense."" 
Jim O'Connor, a spokesman for Burris, told us the amendment ""removes language prohibiting these health services from being offered on military bases, nothing more,"" he said. ""It does not compel doctors to perform these procedures."" 
Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, applauded the amendment at the time, saying: ""The (committee) vote repealing this discriminatory and dangerous ban is the first step to ensuring that servicewomen can use their own private money for abortion care when they are serving overseas."" 
So, under the amendment, it appears military hospitals would be permitted to perform abortions in more cases than currently allowed. 
But Boonstra objected to Cornyn's statement that the amendment ""requires"" military hospitals to provide abortions. ""What it does is lift a ban on military hospitals to perform abortions,"" she said. ""Nothing compels a military hospital or facility to do that. ... The idea that military hospitals would have to set up special mechanisms to provide these abortions just isn't the case."" 
Kevin McLaughlin, Cornyn's spokesman, pointed to a White House statement supporting the amendment, which it said ""would restore a policy to ensure that servicewomen and military dependents — including nearly 50,000 servicewomen stationed overseas — have the ability to obtain abortion services using their own, private funds."" 
However, White House spokesman Matt Lehrich told us that the amendment ""does not require military facilities to provide abortions."" 
The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service states that the changes that Clinton ordered allowing abortions in military hospitals ""did not necessarily have the effect of greatly increasing access to abortion services. Abortions are generally not performed at military medical facilities in the continental United States."" Further, the report notes that few abortions had been performed abroad because the ""military follows the prevailing laws and rules of foreign countries regarding abortion"" and because ""the military has had a difficult time finding health care professional in uniform willing to perform the procedure."" 
Next, we turned to the second part of Cornyn's statement. Would servicewomen get abortions ""on demand,"" as Cornyn puts it? 
McLaughlin said the senator means there would be ""no questions asked"" as opposed to current policy which restricts abortion procedures to women who are pregnant as a result of rape, incest or if her life would be endangered if she carried the pregnancy to term. 
Others have suggested that if the amendment passes into law, abortions wouldn't always be available. 
In a September article published in the Guttmacher Policy Review, Rachel Natelson, the legal and policy adviser at Service Women's Action Network, which advocates for military women, is quoted saying: ""Even if the amendment were adopted, the longstanding ban on the use of federal funds for abortion at military facilities would remain. And for military women stationed overseas who rely on the government for their health care, access to abortion services would remain significantly challenged."" 
Boonstra, who wrote the article, told us the military has a ""conscience clause"" that allows physicians to refuse to perform abortions if they have a moral objection. 
In late 2008, the Bush administration issued a rule stating that federally-funded health workers could decline to perform an abortion or any health care practice that encroaches on that person's ""religious belief or moral conviction."" Opponents said the regulation was so broad that doctors could refuse any treatment. 
Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said at a May 28 news conference that the Burris amendment means abortions ""have got to be prepaid"" out of pocket and would be ""only done on a voluntary basis by a doctor. There is no requirement, in other words, that doctors in military hospitals perform the abortions."" 
Where does that leave us? 
The defense bill stalled before the Senate includes language allowing military hospitals to provide abortions in cases beyond the existing permissible instances of rape, incest or when the mother's life is endangered. But allowing is not the same as requiring. Contrary to Cornyn's claim, we see no mandate in the proposed change. 
As for military hospitals performing abortions ""on demand,"" there are so many conditions on availability — even with the amendment — that Cornyn's description goes too far. We find the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE05140>],/factchecks/2010/sep/27/john-cornyn/sen-john-cornyn-says-annual-defense-authorization-/

""Bag of snakes"" jab leads AJC PolitiFact Georgia to revisit Flip-O-Meter ruling
","
A TV political ad funded by Democrats calls Republican candidate for governor Nathan Deal ""slippery as a bag of snakes.""

This gave AJC PolitiFact Georgia's scribes pause.

The Democrats' candidate is former Gov. Roy Barnes. Didn't he say after the Republican primary runoff that ""just because we have differences doesn’t mean that we have to call each other names""?

We pulled out our Flip-O-Meter, which detects whether politicians have flipped on their positions.

We've used the Flip-O-Meter on Barnes and his opinion on ""civil and polite"" campaigns before. On Aug. 11, Barnes said on WSB-TV that he'd try to run one.

""I think that you can show differences without being mean,"" Barnes said. ""You know, it’s a Southern tradition to be civil and polite. There are differences, but they’re honorable people. And so just because we have differences doesn’t mean that we have to call each other names.

""But we do have a responsibility to show the differences, and I think they do, too. As long as it’s done in a respectful way and one that’s not personal, I think that we can do that.""

In late August, we looked at Barnes' commercials to see if he was true to his word.

We found the ads were not nearly as nasty as those in the Republican gubernatorial runoff. They focused on important issues and cited facts correctly. But with each new TV commercial, he moved further from ""civil and polite"" territory. We ruled Barnes did a Half Flip.

So how's Barnes doing now? We peered into that bag of snakes with the help of two University of Georgia professors: Charles Bullock, an expert on Georgia politics, and Spencer Tinkham,an expert on political messaging.

The Democratic Party of Georgia paid for ""Fabrication,"" the pro-Barnes commercial. It was posted on YouTube.com on Sept. 19.

It was a response to one released several days earlier by the Republican Governors Association.

In both ads, pairs of codgers sit at tables covered in red-checked tablecloths, sipping coffee and swapping homespun political wisdom over the whine of a harmonica.

In the Republican ad, the old men remember the term of Barnes, which ended in 2003, as an unhappy chapter in Georgia's history.

In Democrats' ad, ""times were better"" when Barnes was governor, one of the men says.

""So this Washington guy Deal is lying?"" a second man asks.

""Slippery as a bag of snakes,"" his friend replies.

""I guess we can call him a 'shady Deal,' "" the second man quips.

The scene ends. An announcer says, ""Nathan Deal. Too corrupt, even for Congress.""

Bullock's verdict: Negative.

Tinkham's verdict: It's not a negative ad. It's a comparative one. A true negative ad would not mention the positive things done by the candidate it supports, he said.

""I wouldn't call the ad 'civil and polite,' "" Tinkham said.  ""But I think Barnes successfully separates himself from its content to such an extent that it is difficult to attribute the incivility and impoliteness to him. Rather, it seems that it's the 'good ole boys' in the coffee shop who are making the negative judgments.""

In Barnes' defense, Emil Runge, a spokesman for Barnes' campaign, said the ad was in response to a ""misleading"" one by Republicans. He added that Barnes never said he would avoid pointing out differences between himself and Deal.

Since our experts were split and Runge made reasonable points, we looked at four other pro-Barnes TV commercials to see if the overall tone of Barnes' ads has shifted.

""Fresh Start,"" released Aug. 27, compares Barnes to Deal on ethics. Deal might spend too much time clearing his name on ethics accusations, it said. Barnes has no such problems, so he can devote more time to Georgians.

""Padlock,"" also released Aug. 27, features a cartoon of Deal in what appears to be a windowless storage closet. It said Deal is ""hiding something,"" but offers no facts to back up its claim.

""Secret Lease,"" released Sept. 6, said Deal's release of his tax returns is ""a desperate attempt to fool the voters"" and calls Deal ""too corrupt, even for Congress.""

""Investigation,"" also released Sept. 6, scrolls through headlines about Deal's run-in with congressional ethics investigators and asks whether, if elected, he'd spend too much time clearing his name.

While ""Fresh Start"" and ""Investigation"" for the most part stick to the facts on the legitimate issue of candidate ethics, ""Secret Lease"" accuses Deal of trying to deceive voters without clear proof, and ""Padlock"" is almost all insinuation.

With these most recent commercials, Barnes is heading even deeper into negative territory. Deep enough to turn his Flip-O-Meter rating from a Half Flip to a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAE8480>],/factchecks/2010/sep/27/roy-barnes/bag-snakes-jab-leads-ajc-politifact-georgia-revisi/

Scott Bruun says federal spending has doubled since 2000
","
Like many Republican candidates this year, Scott Bruun is hoping to beat Democratic incumbent Rep. Kurt Schrader by taking aim at government spending. Bruun says the country is awash in debt, weighed down by taxes, and spending money in a way that ""insults drunken sailors.""

He also says this: ""The size of our federal government has more than doubled since the year 2000.’’

First, it’s important to note that Bruun was referring to total spending. He made his comment in a statement on his campaign’s website in a longer discussion about federal spending.

At first glance, it appears he is right. His campaign cited numbers from the federal Office of Management and Budget that show total federal spending in 2000 was $1.78 trillion. By 2009, spending increased to $3.5 trillion. So that’s about double in unadjusted dollars.

But if you account for inflation, the spending total is $1.78 trillion in 2000 and goes to $2.29 trillion in 2009. That’s only a 29 percent increase.

And other ways of measuring the size of the federal government also come up far short of ""double.""

Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, an independent think tank that studies federal spending and budgets, says the more accurate way to judge the government’s fiscal posture is to consider spending relative to the country’s gross domestic product, or GDP. That way, you’re getting a more holistic view since the calculation compares spending to the size of the overall economy.

Using that approach, government spending as part of GDP went from 18.2 percent in 2000 to 24.7 percent in 2009. That increase is also far short of the doubling that Bruun claimed.

Contrast those numbers to those hit during the peak of World War II -- 43.6 percent of GDP in both 1943 and 1944.

It’s also worth looking at the size of the federal workforce, which has increased only slightly. The total federal personnel, which includes the military, has grown from 4.1 million in 2000 to 4.4 million in 2009. So that, too, is not close to double.

So it’s quite a stretch for Bruun to make that claim. When you adjust the number for inflation, measure it as a percentage of GDP and check the size of the federal workforce, it is far short of double. We find his claim Barely True.

"['Stimulus', 'Wisconsin', 'Tom Nelson']","
Tom Nelson says initial stimulus allocation created tens of thousands of new jobs in Wisconsin
","
If you want to incite lively conversation during halftime of your next Packer party, ask how many jobs have been created by the federal stimulus.  

Let’s just say that opinions differ -- widely -- on how effective the stimulus has been.

If your party-goers include Tom Nelson, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, he might chime in before anyone reached for another cheese curd.

""I have a track record of dealing with tough budgets as a vehicle, as a means to get people back to work,"" Nelson said in a radio interview that aired a week before his Sept. 14 primary win. ""And we were one of the first states in the country to pass and to implement a statewide stimulus that has led to the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in every corner of this state.""

That’s a lot of new jobs.

Nelson, the majority leader of the state Assembly, used the term ""statewide stimulus."" But he told PolitiFact Wisconsin he meant the federal stimulus money that was distributed throughout the state.

More specifically, Nelson said he was referring in the radio interview to the 2009 Wisconsin Act 2. That law, which Nelson voted for, was adopted in February 2009 by three-vote margins in both the Assembly and the Senate. It was a budget-adjustment measure that also directed an initial $300 million in federal stimulus funds to the state Department of Transportation. The money was for 47 projects, mostly on highways and freeways.

So, for Nelson’s ""tens of thousands"" of jobs statement to be correct, that $300 million would have to have created at least 20,000 jobs.

Did it?

From the beginning, stimulus job-count figures have been beset with problems, in Wisconsin and around the country.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, for example, found that an October 2009 report by the White House -- claiming stimulus money created or saved more than 10,000 jobs in Wisconsin -- was rife with errors, double counting and inflated numbers. In January 2010, the White House abandoned its method of counting jobs ""created or saved."" Instead, it began labeling jobs as having been funded by stimulus dollars.

That isn’t to say the stimulus has not had any effect. A July 2010 paper by two economists -- one from the public sector and one rom the private -- said stimulus spending created 2.7 million jobs.

But Nelson’s claim was not about all stimulus money, just that initial gush of cash given to the DOT.

Nelson said he based his jobs statement on ""talking points,"" which he later said were based on two sources: 
But Nelson is mixing apples and oranges.

The first talking point refers to jobs created or saved, when Nelson’s comment referred only to jobs created. What’s more, the 63,000 figure is based on all stimulus money given to the state as of August 2010, not the initial $300 million Nelson originally cited.

The second talking point moves everything to a different source. It claims the state budget -- not stimulus money -- would create the jobs cited. Or the budget and remaining stimulus money. Again, Nelson is off point.

There are hard numbers -- rather than predictions -- that Nelson could have used to gauge the effect of the $300 million given to DOT.

PolitiFact Wisconsin analyzed figures from Recovery.gov, the federal website that tracks stimulus funds. The latest data available show that, through the first half of 2010, the $300 million cited by Nelson funded 1,203 jobs.

There’s no way to know how many were created and how many were saved. But that’s miles away from Nelson’s original claim.

OK, almost time for the second half kickoff.

Where does all of this leave us?

Nelson stated that an initial $300 million in stimulus money for road projects created tens of thousands of jobs in Wisconsin. As evidence, he turns to much broader measures -- jobs created or saved, all stimulus spending, the state budget and stimulus money. But the actual jobs figure from the initial allotment barely exceeds 1,200 -- and even that is a mix of jobs created and jobs saved.

We rate Nelson’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBDE100>],/factchecks/2010/sep/26/tom-nelson/tom-nelson-says-initial-stimulus-allocation-create/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Pundits', 'Nick Gillespie']","
Does emergency care account for just 2 percent of all health spending?
","In recent years, advocates for universal health coverage have regularly decried a side effect of having no health insurance -- the use of emergency rooms as a substitute for basic health care services. For instance, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said in August 2009, ""We have 48 million people with no health care. As a result, they walk into emergency rooms. It's costing every American who is insured $1,100 to pick up the cost of uncompensated care that goes on at the emergency room."" We gave Boxer’s claim a Mostly False, largely due to questionable assumptions that undermined the calculations Boxer cited. But other Democrats in favor of a health care overhaul, including Hillary Clinton in 2008 and Barack Obama in 2009, also pointed to the use of emergency rooms by uninsured Americans as an argument for passing a health care overhaul. Given the frequency of this talking point, it came as something of a surprise to hear Nick Gillespie, the editor of Reason.com, a libertarian publication, say recently that emergency room costs actually represent a tiny share of health care spending. During the Oct. 22, 2013, edition of CNN’s Crossfire, Gillespie had an exchange with Van Jones, one of the show’s liberal co-hosts. Jones argued that Obama’s health care law should be able to bring uninsured Americans into the health care system in less costly and more efficient ways, cutting the use of emergency rooms for front-line care. Gillespie countered that ""emergency rooms (are) 2 percent of all health care spending. It's not a huge amount. That's a big red herring in this."" We wondered whether Gillespie was correct. We easily found the source of the statistic -- a calculation publicized by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Obviously, this is a group with a dog in the fight, but the calculation they made was pretty straightforward and is based on federal data. The group used figures from 2008 collected by the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a study undertaken by a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. The survey found that the total amount of money spent on emergency care -- including physician and other emergency-room services -- was $47.3 billion. That’s slightly less than 2 percent of the same survey’s $2.4 trillion estimate of total health care expenditures that year. We asked a number of experts in health care economics whether they saw any red flags with that kind ofcalculation. Both Austin Frakt of Boston University and Katherine Baicker of the Harvard School of Public Health said the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey is a credible source of data. Their concerns, to the extent they had any, focused on whether the survey under-reports health care costs. Indeed, there is at least one study that suggests just that. A paper in the Annals of Emergency Medicine used different data and an alternative accounting method to determine emergency room costs. The study -- by Michael Lee and Brian Zink of Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School and Jeremiah Schuur of Harvard Medical School -- used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, which tallied approximately 130 million ER visits, a much higher number than the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which counted 49 million visits. Based in part on this discrepancy, the authors said the actual percentage may range anywhere from 4.9 percent to 10 percent, rather than 2 percent. The American College of Emergency Physicians stands by its calculations but acknowledges that other calculations can be legitimate. The data that produced the 2 percent figure ""comes from reputable sources, and the calculation is correct,"" said spokeswoman Julie Lloyd. ""At the same time, we know that the numbers could be calculated in different ways."" Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, agreed that the percentage of health care spending devoted to emergency rooms could change depending on what figure is used for the denominator. ""All these expenditure figures are at best approximations,"" Wilensky said. ""There is no really good, precise way to calculate it."" Several experts added that the total amount of money going to emergency care is ultimately less important than making sure that emergency rooms are used for the right type of care. Services provided in the ER do tend to cost significantly more than services provided in a primary-care setting. ""Getting anything other than true emergency care in an emergency department tends to be an expensive, fragmented way to receive care and should be avoided if any other reasonable alternative is available,"" Wilensky said. That said, recent academic studies have suggested that the economics of emergency rooms and the larger health care system are more nuanced than previously thought. For instance, one study by the Rand Corp. suggested that it may be overburdened primary-care doctors -- not patients -- who are driving traffic toward the ER. According to Arthur Kellermann, one of the authors of the RAND paper, doctors described the ER to researchers as their ""overflow valve"" where they ""send complicated patients"" for diagnosis. Even Lee, who co-wrote the paper suggesting that ERs could account for as much as 10 percent of health care spending, has said that heavy use of emergency rooms is not necessarily a problem. ""Diverting non-emergency care may simply shift costs onto primary care offices and clinics which may not have the infrastructure to accommodate a large volume of unscheduled care,"" Lee told Science Daily. Our ruling Gillespie said emergency rooms account for ""2 percent of all health care spending."" Experts told us that’s not the only way to calculate it, but it’s a credible way, and even if that figure is too low, other calculations put it in the single digits. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB5B040>],/factchecks/2013/oct/28/nick-gillespie/does-emergency-care-account-just-2-percent-all-hea/

Wisconsin sold fresh water to California, potential Democratic congressional candidate says
","After their father and five other worshippers were shot to death on Aug. 5, 2012 at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis., brothers Amar and Pardeep Kaleka became active with Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Pardeep said in a video for the national group, of which the Oak Creek and Milwaukee mayors are members, that 34 Americans are murdered with guns every day. We rated his statement Mostly True. Ten months later, Amar (also known as Amardeep) stepped into an even more public role, announcing plans to run in 2014 against eight-term U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice-presidential candidate.   Kaleka, a 35-year-old Democrat and documentary filmmaker, was interviewed about his planned candidacy on the Oct. 20, 2013 edition of ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" a public affairs program on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee. When Gousha asked Kaleka what he would say to people who might view him as a one-dimensional candidate focused on guns, Kaleka turned the conversation to the economy. ""I mean, gun legislation is just one of the many things that are holding us down economically. A number of other things, immigration reform, the economic disparity that we’re experiencing, has to do with our thoughts and models that we’ve had in place for now, well over two decades,"" he said. ""I mean, the Midwest is a great example of how we’re losing so many factories and manufacturing jobs and agricultural jobs. For example, we used to be called America's Dairyland. Now, California is called America's Dairyland. We sent them fresh water, and we sold it to them. Ultimately, we didn't get anything in exchange. We lost a bunch of jobs, a bunch of farmland."" It’s been two decades since California eclipsed Wisconsin in milk production, although Wisconsin still calls itself America’s Dairyland. But we’ve never heard that Wisconsin had sold fresh water to California to boost their dairy industry -- and lost jobs and farmland in the process. Wouldn’t there have been a titanic hue and cry if that had ever happened? Big ideas To be sure, there have been some grandiose proposals to sell Great Lakes water to faraway places. In 1998, a Canadian company actually obtained a permit from Ontario to ship fresh water by tankers from Lake Superior to Asia. But after a backlash in Canada and the United States, the permit was canceled two weeks later. In 2007, Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Richardson raised the possibility of exporting Great Lakes water to the Southwest, calling for a national water policy and saying ""states like Wisconsin are awash in water."" But less than two weeks after Richardson’s comments rattled Midwest politicians, his campaign issued a statement saying Richardson ""in no way proposes federal transfers of water from one region of the nation to the other."" The following year, the eight Great Lakes states reached agreement on the Great Lakes Compact, which bans Great Lakes water from being ""diverted,"" or piped out of the basin, with a few exceptions, such as the possible sale of Lake Michigan water from Oak Creek to another Milwaukee suburb, Waukesha, which is under consideration. Even then, Waukesha would have to return 100 percent of the water by volume to the lake by discharging treated wastewater to the Root River in Franklin. Even with the compact, officials remain wary of outsiders coveting Great Lakes water, said Tim Eder, executive director of the Great Lakes Commission, an interstate agency that promotes the development, use and conservation of water in the Great Lakes basin. So, was there a Wisconsin sale of fresh water to California before the 2008 compact? ""No way. It's really simple,"" Eder said of Kaleka’s claim. ""He’s wrong. I don’t know where he’s getting his information, but it’s not based in fact."" Two other experts -- Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources water use section chief Eric Ebersberger, and Peter Annin, managing director of the University of Notre Dame Environmental Change Initiative, which does research on water resources -- were also dumbfounded and emphatic: No water sale to California has ever occurred. And if it never occurred, it certainly didn’t boost the dairy industry there, or mean lost jobs or farmland here. Indeed, federal figures show that in 2012, Wisconsin produced 27.2 billion pounds of milk, a record for the state, and led the nation by producing 2.79 billion pounds of cheese. Said Annin, author of ""The Great Lakes Water Wars"": ""I’m not aware of any instance where the State of Wisconsin, or anybody in the state of Wisconsin, sold water to California. There’ve been a lot of weird proposals, but they’ve never actually happened."" We also checked with the federal Mississippi River Commission, which assured us that water from the Mississippi River was never sold to California. Kaleka, meanwhile, told us he meant to say ""we thought about sending them fresh water."" He added: ""I'm going to have to take my hit on this. It was a sloppy response to a very big problem of local and national economics."" But on even that he is off. None of the information Kaleka provided us indicates that Wisconsin even considered selling water to California. And we could find no record of it. Our rating Kaleka said Wisconsin sold fresh water to California and ""lost a bunch of jobs (and) a bunch of farmland."" There’s no evidence of such a water sale, something that would have made for countless front-page stories, let alone it leading to a loss of jobs and farmland in Wisconsin. The statement is false and ridiculous: Pants on Fire.

No basis to NextGen claim Cuccinelli wants to ban all contraception
","As the campaign reaches its final stretch, Democrats and their allies continue to accuse Ken Cuccinelli of holding extreme views on everything from climate change to birth control. NextGen Climate Action Committee, a Democratic-aligned super pac, has fired out a series of mailers during the last two weeks accusing Cuccinelli, among other things, of ""wanting to eliminate all forms of birth control."" We asked Brian Mahar, a spokesman for the super pac, for proof of the claim. He cited a Sept. 4 editorial in The Washington Post criticizing Cuccinelli’s support of a 2007 bill in the General Assembly that would have extended to human embryos a ""right to the enjoyment of life"" from the moment of fertilization. The editorial said the failed legislation would have ""provided an opening to prohibit common methods of birth control, including the pill and intrauterine devices."" The Post editorial, however, made no claim that every form of birth control -- including condoms and spermicides -- would have been banned under the bill. Debate over the impact of legislation that confers personhood from the moment of conception centers on how various forms of birth control work. No one disputes that devices that merely prevent fertilization wouldn’t be affected by personhood laws. The issue is that some forms -- including the intrauterine device, emergency contraception and birth control pills -- may also work by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. Some people say those methods go beyond mere contraception and are tantamount to causing an abortion. In 2012, as Virginia was debating another personhood measure, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released a statement saying laws that bestow rights from the moment of fertilization would restrict contraception choices. The group wrote, ""some of the most effective and reliable forms of contraception, such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices,, and other forms of FDA-approved hormonal contraceptives could be banned in states that adopt ‘personhood’ measures."" But the organization’s statement, which was cited in editorial NextGen references, never said all forms of contraception would be banned. It said personhood laws would leave ""condoms, natural family planning and spermicides the only legally allowed forms of birth control."" In a September Truth-O-Meter, we gave a Half True to Cuccinelli’s statement that he’s never supported legislation that invades contraceptive choices. We noted that while the personhood bills he’s backed never explicitly sought to ban birth control, they could have opened legal avenues to challenge certain forms of contraception. Cuccinelli has repeatedly said he would not seek to restrict contraception. We asked his campaign how he defines birth control but did not receive a clear response. As a state senator in 2003, Cuccinelli voted against a bill that would have specified that contraception that prevents implantation of a fertilized egg is not an abortion. Our ruling NextGen Climate Action Committee says Cuccinelli wants to ""eliminate all forms of birth control."" The group cites an editorial that said personhood legislation Cuccinelli supported could have fostered legal challenges to types of contraception that prevent the implantation of fertilized eggs. But the editorial made no assertion Cuccinelli wants to ban all birth control devices. Cuccinelli has repeatedly said he has no interest in restricting contraception, which generally works by preventing ovulation or the fertilization of a human egg. NextGen doesn’t have a speck of proof to bolster its incendiary claim that Cuccinelli wants to ban all forms of birth control -- even condoms and spermicides.

"['New Jersey', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie ad claims Barbara Buono voted to give herself a 40 percent raise
","Politicians and pay raises go about as well together as oil and water, from a taxpayer’s perspective. And Gov. Chris Christie knows it. That might explain why one of his latest gubernatorial TV campaign ads targeting Democratic challenger Barbara Buono, a state senator, claims she voted to give herself a significant salary bump during her time in the Legislature. Buono ""voted to raise her own pay 40 percent,"" the ad claims, from $35,000 to $49,000, as it points out differences between the two candidates in areas of education, taxes and more. The election is Nov. 5. Buono was an Assembly member when she voted to raise her salary, but the ad doesn’t mention a couple of key points: the sponsor of the legislation for the hikes is a Republican friend and ally of Christie’s, and the vote happened nearly 14 years ago. Let’s review the history behind the bill in question, S2297, and where Buono fits in. Republican state Sen. Joe Kyrillos Jr. -- Christie’s close friend -- and Sen. Bernard F. Kenny, a Democrat from Hudson County, sponsored the bill, which was introduced on Jan. 6, 2000. It called for increasing the salaries of the governor, judges, cabinet members, county prosecutors and members of the Legislature. In advocating for the bill, Kyrillos of Monmouth County noted in multiple published reports at the time that lawmakers hadn’t had a raise in 12 years and that a raise was warranted because lawmakers’ jobs had become ""demanding."" Both houses of the Legislature passed the bill on Jan. 10, 2000. For legislators, the result was the 40 percent hike. Buono (D-Metuchen) voted for the raise, the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services confirmed. By comparison, the gubernatorial salary increased from $130,000 to $175,000 -- an approximate 35 percent hike. The governor at the time was Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican. The salary increases for governor and Legislature members didn’t take effect until January 2002, while salary hikes for judges, prosecutors, cabinet members and others had their pay increased upon enactment of the law. In addition to Buono’s vote, we also reviewed OLS documents showing how every other member of the Legislature voted on the salary hike bill. The votes were essentially an even split in the 80-member Assembly. Of 48 Republicans, 32 voted in favor, 15 voted against and one lawmaker didn’t vote. Among 32 Democrats, 16 - including Buono - voted in favor, 13 voted against and three didn’t vote. The state’s 40 senators had a similar tally. Among 24 Republicans, 13 voted yes, seven voted no and four didn’t vote. Eight Democrats voted for the bill, seven voted against it and one didn’t vote. That means the bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate and Assembly. The Republican role in the pay hike can’t be discounted, according to Buono’s campaign. ""Governor Christie has repeatedly used a specious claim that omits key details,"" spokesman Sam Salustro said in an e-mail. ""This was legislation sponsored by a key Christie ally who intensely fought for its passage, passed by a Republican legislature and signed by a Republican governor. The Governor has benefited from the law and is one of the only New Jersey governors in recent memory to take the full salary. So before he throws stones, he should take a look at his own party first."" The bottom line is Buono’s vote, Christie’s campaign spokesman said. ""So, in short, Barbara Buono cast a vote to raise her salary by 40% while embarking on a career of voting to raise taxes and fees on New Jerseyans 154 times and neither she nor her campaign is disputing it,"" spokesman Kevin Roberts said in an e-mail. Our ruling A recent TV ad from the Christie gubernatorial campaign claims Buono ""voted to raise her own pay 40 percent."" OLS documents show that members of the state’s 208th Legislature, including Buono in the Assembly, voted to raise salaries for themselves, the governor, cabinet members, county prosecutors and more. It’s worth noting, however, that the bill was sponsored by Christie friend and political ally Joe Kyrillos, passed by a Republican-controlled Legislature and signed into law by a Republican governor -- nearly 14 years ago. So yes, Buono voted to raise her salary 40 percent -- with a heap of help from her Republican friends and colleagues. Since the claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

Chris Abele says Milwaukee area trails only Boston in college students per capita
","Chris Abele says he’s ""one of the most unapologetically proud Milwaukeeans,"" pointing to things such as the lakefront festivals, Milwaukee Art Museum and the new Milwaukee Rotary Centennial Arboretum along the Milwaukee River. In an Oct. 1, 2013 speech to the Rotary Club of Milwaukee, the Milwaukee County executive had plenty more for the list. ""We’re second only to Boston in college students per capita,"" Abele said. ""We have low labor turnover, low absenteeism, low loan default, incredibly high volunteerism, and some industries that are placed in really strategic places."" All sounds great. But what about those college students? In April of 2013, the Journal Sentinel reported the Milwaukee metropolitan area ranks about average in the share of residents with college degrees. All told, 31.4 percent of adults have degrees. But the area has more than 100,000 college students, from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to Marquette, Cardinal Stritch to Carroll, Alverno to the Milwaukee School of Engineering, the tech colleges and for-profits such as Bryant & Stratton College and DeVry University. The list goes on. Is it possible that the area ranks behind only Boston as a student hub? When we asked Abele for backup, his office said he was referring to 1996 data cited in a McGill University study of student concentrations in the 30 largest metro areas in the United States and Canada. However, Abele could not locate the actual study, which involves data from 17 years ago. We couldn’t either, nor could McGill officials. The closest we found was a Journal Sentinel story from 2000, when the study came out. It said the McGill study ranked the Milwaukee metro area sixth overall and fifth among U.S. metros in college students per capita. Boston was first in the United States (though it trailed Montreal in North America), followed by Denver, Minneapolis-St.Paul and Norfolk-Virginia Beach-Newport News. So, Milwaukee certainly ranked high, but Abele’s memory was off on Milwaukee’s specific rank. Around the same time, the Atlanta Regional Council for Higher Education found that Milwaukee ranked 13th among the top 50 largest metro areas. In any case, both studies are very outdated, and Abele’s claim was that Milwaukee ranks that high today. Here is a look at some more recent research: Middle among mid-size metros: Milwaukee ranked in the middle -- 16th of 30 -- among ""mid-size metros"" for student concentration in the 2013-’14 version of the American Institute for Economic Research’s annual ""College Destinations Index."" When looking at 229 metro areas with more than 15,000 students, Milwaukee ranked 134th in student concentration, the group’s spokesman Jon Sylbert said, quoting from statistics set for official release in late 2013. Abele, of course, could not have seen these rankings because they were not public. But last year’s AIER study was much the same story, ranking the Milwaukee metro area 14th among mid-size metros, and 123rd in the broader group. The latest AIER study used 2011 US Census data on enrollment. The Census defines college students as people attending a 4-year or 2-year college, university, or professional school, full time or part time, in courses that may advance the student toward a recognized college or university degree. Middle among top metros: Milwaukee ranked 23rd among the top 50 metro areas for student concentration, according to Kevin Stolarick, research director at The Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto. San Diego led, followed by Austin, Sacramento, Boston and San Jose, said Stolarick, who has studied student concentration and is a colleague of demographics expert Richard Florida. He also uses census data and definitions, but measures the number of college students against only the 15 and older population of an area. More broadly, Stolarick found that Milwaukee ranked 153rd of the 374 largest metro areas and 269th among 955 metros and smaller areas. So, the current research puts Milwaukee pretty far down the list. Behind the numbers Obviously such rankings can change depending on whether you include small ""college towns"" such as Ames, Iowa, home to Iowa State University, which had the highest student concentration according to the AIER study. The 2000 McGill study -- the one that cannot be located -- sought to eliminate those small college towns from the equation. But even if you take that approach with the more recent data, the Milwaukee metro area was nowhere near the top in concentration of students even among very large metro areas. For example, using the data from AIER, Milwaukee trails Boston, Miami, Richmond, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Buffalo, Raleigh, Philadelphia, Oklahoma City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore, San Diego and others. So, what to make of the McGill study cited by Abele, and this area of research in general? Even Mark Michaud, an official in the office at McGill University that produced the study cited by Abele, urged caution. He told us he would question any rankings claims of this nature ""since all it takes is some creative definition for either the numerator (who exactly are college students?) or the denominator (what exactly is a city’s population?)."" Abele’s office also cited media accounts of growth in the number of college graduates moving to Milwaukee. But that doesn’t bear on Abele’s claim about current student enrollment. Our rating Abele said, ""We’re second only to Boston in college students per capita."" The county exec relies on decade-and-a-half-old data from a study that is no longer available and, in any event, does not back up his claim. A second dated study we found from 1996 put Milwaukee at 13th of 50. More recent research ranks the area far from the head of the class. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB961140>],/factchecks/2013/oct/27/chris-abele/chris-abele-says-milwaukee-area-trails-only-boston/

Education critic Diane Ravitch says test scores went up for 40 years until federal No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top initiatives
","Education analyst and professor Diane Ravitch is a harsh critic of many recent trends in education, from high-stakes testing to privately run charter schools. Ravitch supported many of those efforts when she was assistant secretary of education under President George H.W. Bush. But she later concluded they didn’t work. And she has been especially critical of both the 2002 federal No Child Left Behind Act, championed by President George W. Bush, and President Obama’s 2009 Race to the Top grant program. Ravitch offered some of her insights in a speech Oct. 15, 2013, at the University of Rhode Island. Part of her argument is that champions of such so-called reforms are overstating the problem. She said a decades-look back at standardized test scores shows more student improvement than the nation’s public schools get credit for. ""Test scores had gone up steadily for 40 years until No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top,"" she said. We wondered whether scores had increased so steadily and whether, as her statement implies, they leveled off or dropped after the two federal programs took hold. Ravitch told us her 40-year claim was a condensed version of a point she makes at greater length in her new book, ""Reign of Error: The Hoax of The Privatization Movement and the Danger to America’s Public Schools."" She said that claim is backed up by the results of  the National Assessment of Educational Progress Long-Term Trend Assessments, a nationwide standardized test that has been given to students since the early 1970s (From 1997 to 2004, Ravitch was a member of the NAEP Governing Board, which oversees the test.). The NAEP tests are given every few years to 9-year-olds, 13-year-olds and 17-year-olds. The reading part of the test was first administered in 1971 and the math in 1973. Since then, except for a 2004 update, the test has remained substantially unchanged. That constancy has enabled educators to use it as a way to compare student performance year-to-year and even decade-to-decade. ""NAEP is the only gauge of change over time,"" Ravitch wrote in ""Reign of Error."" That brings us to the time period Ravitch was using. She cited a steady trend over 40 years, until the No Child Left Behind Act and Race to the Top. The time spans are actually 32 and 38 years, respectively. No Child Left Behind was implemented in 2003. We made that the end point for our examination, because it’s the first marker Ravitch cited and because the act made more sweeping changes and has been in effect longer. Our beginning points were 1971, when the NAEP reading test was first administered, and 1973, when the math test began. Test scores for the periods are found in ""NAEP 2008 Trend in Academic Progress"",  published by the U.S. Education Department’s National Center for Educational Statistics.   From 1971 through 2004 -- the closest test date to No Child Left Behind -- average reading scores did go up overall, except for the oldest students. In 1971, 9-year-olds had an average score of 208; in 2004, their average score was 219, a gain of 11 points. For 13-year-olds, the average score went from 255 in 1971 to 259 in 2004, a gain of 4 points. The 1971 and 2004 scores for 17-year-olds were identical: 285. Math scores also went up from 1973 through 2004. Again, scores of younger students showed bigger improvement: 9-year-olds scored 219 in 1973 and 241 in 2004, a gain of 22. Thirteen year-olds scored 266 in 1973 and 281 in 2004, a gain of 15.  The increase for 17-year-olds was only 4 points over that period, from 304 to 307. Somewhat contrary to what Ravitch claimed, not all the math and reading scores increases went up steadily. There were a few small dips along the way, although the overall trend was up. Then there’s the word ""until"" in Ravitch’s statement. It implies that the rising trend stopped or reversed after No Child Left Behind. In fact, according to the 2012 Nation’s Report Card, the increases continued for nearly all age groups through 2012, the most recent testing period. In reading, scores increased 2 points for 9-year-olds, 4 points for 13-year-olds and 2 points for 17-year-olds. In math, scores increased 3 points for 9-year-olds and 4 points for 13-year-olds. They decreased by 1 point for 17-year-olds. Our ruling Education critic Diane Ravitch said, ""Test scores had gone up steadily for 40 years until No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top."" There are a few problems with her statement. First, the time spans for the scores she cites are 32 and 38 years, not 40. Second, while the scores increased overall, there were a few dips. And for 17-year-olds, the overall increases were insignificant. Finally, despite her implication that the increases stopped after No Child Left Behind, scores actually rose for all age groups in 2008 and for nearly all in 2012, the next two testing periods. Because Ravitch’s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, the judges rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB90BD00>],/factchecks/2013/oct/27/diane-ravitch/education-critic-diane-ravitch-says-test-scores-we/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Florida', 'Pam Stewart']","
State education chief says there's no additional costs for implementing Common Core education standards
","One of the many complaints about Florida’s move toward new school standards has centered on its cost. ""Based on data from several sources, the Common Core standards and accompanying tests will be very expensive – both to implement and to maintain,"" the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition argues on its website. At a recent public hearing on the standards, Florida education commissioner Pam Stewart challenged the criticism of the K-12 English and math standards. ""Our analysis is there is not an additional cost with implementation of the Common Core standards,"" Stewart said. Her assertion brought out the doubters, even among Common Core supporters. PolitiFact Florida decided to take a closer look. The issue isn’t as clear cut as you might imagine. Most policy analysts watching Common Core agree that its implementation carries expenses. The National Conference of State Legislatures offers a sample list of what to expect: one-time transition costs such as new instructional materials, tests, technology and teacher training, and ongoing maintenance and updates. ""When taking into account all of the things that need to be updated and the fact that it’s difficult for state education agencies to change their practice (move away from ‘business as usual’), I think it will be extremely challenging to keep costs flat,"" said Anne Hyslop, an education analyst for the New America Foundation. Indeed, the Florida Department of Education created a spreadsheet in February detailing more than $100 million in Common Core projects the state had embarked upon. The items included $24 million for the creation of student tutorial lessons, $4.7 million to generate math assessments and lesson study toolkits, and $25.5 million for a database of test questions for teachers to use. Funding for the vast majority of these projects came from a federal Race to the Top grant that Florida won, in part, for agreeing to adopt the Common Core.   During the spring 2013 legislative session, Florida lawmakers noted that testing for the new standards would require computers, and they adopted a law barring the state from using Common Core-affiliated tests until all schools had the needed technology in place. The bill analysis noted that the State Board of Education requested $442 million for the improvements, a number later revised downward to $100 million. So the Common Core price tag is well documented. But that doesn’t make Stewart completely wrong. ""It costs something,"" said Patrick Murphy, research director for the Public Policy Institute of California. ""The question is, does it cost extra money than we were going to spend?"" Murphy noted Stewart’s use of the word ""additional,"" and said that makes all the difference. ""It is not impossible to conceive of a scenario where existing funds that may have been slated for, say, ‘general’ professional development will be used to focus on the (Common Core).  If I was running a school district, that is what I would do,"" he said. In a paper for the Thomas B. Fordham Institute titled ""Putting a Price Tag on the Common Core,"" Murphy and colleagues put forth three models under which states might implement Common Core -- ""Bare Bones,"" ""Business as Usual"" and ""Balanced."" In two of the three possibilities, the group projected Florida to carry millions in added costs. Florida Department of Education officials did not have any reports that separated costs out in such a way. State officials noted, though, that adoption of the standards cost nothing, and that much of the implementation, such as training and textbook purchases, would have been funded in some form even if the state weren’t using the standards. ""The purchase of materials for the new standards was embedded in our regular instructional materials purchase cycle so did not result in additional purchases or increased costs unless school districts chose to do so,"" DOE spokeswoman Tiffany Cowie said in an email. As another example, the state’s move to improve school technology could be attributed to a 2011 legislative mandate to have materials fully digital by 2015, or an even earlier press to transition all state testing to computers. ""This process began before Florida’s standards were adopted and will continue regardless of Florida’s new standards,"" Cowie said. Also, Florida has paid about $30.59 per student annually for FCAT testing in recent years. It has not selected a Common Core test, so it has no estimate for the potential cost differences. ""If the department chooses PARCC, no additional cost will be incurred, as the creation of the test is free to all participating PARCC states,"" Cowie said. ""If another test is selected, there will be costs associated with the procurement of a new test."" From the department’s view, then, much of the money would have been spent on similar projects anyway, with or without the new standards. Our ruling Stewart said implementation of the Common Core would not incur additional expenses. Some of the money spent on Common Core is money the state would have spent anyway on curriculum and testing. But experts said it’s unlikely that implementing the new standards cost the state no additional money. Another wrinkle: The state received a federal grant to help pay for Common Core implementation. We rate her statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEFC280>],/factchecks/2013/oct/27/pam-stewart/state-education-chief-says-theres-no-additional-co/
"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Rubio says 300,000 will lose their individual health insurance coverage under Obamacare and won't be able to enroll in new plans
","Recent letters to 300,000 Floridians from Florida Blue, a division of Blue Cross Blue Shield, have injected new vigor into claims that the health care law means consumers will lose their insurance. ""The issue of Obamacare is about a much broader agenda to inject more government control over our lives and over our economy,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on Fox’s The O’Reilly Factor. ""On this very day in Florida, it was announced that 300,000 people are going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don’t have health insurance. They are going to owe the IRS money in the form of a fine. Where are they supposed to go now and buy that health insurance if the website isn’t working, if Consumer Reports is telling people to avoid the website?"" Rubio’s concerns about the website referred to healthcare.gov, the federal government’s online marketplace for health insurance. The website has been plagued with problems and hasn’t been functioning properly since its debut on Oct. 1. Rubio made his claim during a week when the announcement by Florida Blue affecting 300,000 policy holders received much attention. (U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla., and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich made similar statements related to Florida Blue.) We asked Rubio's office for evidence to support his claim. ""This is pretty simple,"" said Rubio's spokesman Alex Conant in an email to PolitiFact Florida. ""Question: can any one of the 300,000 people keep their current health plan? Answer: No."" We decided to check Rubio’s claim: Are 300,000 people going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare? And will they face the consequences Rubio suggests? Florida Blue’s letters On Oct. 21, Kaiser Health News reported that health plans were sending hundreds of thousands of cancellation letters to people who buy their own coverage. We found the news repeated by several news outlets and blogs, with headlines such as this one in the Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog: ""Who’s to blame for the 300,000 policy purge? Florida Blue or Obamacare or both?"" In response to the news coverage, Florida Blue issued a statement: ""The Affordable Care Act mandates that all health insurance coverage packages provide 10 categories of essential health benefits. Because some plans offered by all insurers did not include all of these new services, they will no longer be available. Approximately 300,000 current Florida Blue members are enrolled in plans that will not meet these new benefit requirements. ""Florida Blue is proactively communicating to these members to help them understand how this transition affects them. Prior to their 2014 renewal date, each member will receive a letter that instructs them to contact Florida Blue to review their migration options. These new plans will offer members access to more comprehensive benefits in 2014. ""It is important to note that a person’s individual situation will be the key driver of what they will pay for coverage under the ACA. Subsidies will be available in the marketplace to lower the cost of coverage for eligible individuals, and the amount an individual will pay could vary significantly once his or her specific age, area in which they live, smoking status, family size, and income are factored in."" The Miami Herald’s Public Insight Network obtained copies of letters received by Florida Blue consumers. The letters stated that due to the Affordable Care Act, the consumer’s particular plan ""will be closed"" and recommended another Florida Blue plan. ""To help ensure that you have continuous health care coverage, you’ll be enrolled in this health plan effective Jan. 1, 2014, unless we hear from you by Nov. 1, 2013."" The letters stated that consumers could choose a different Florida Blue plan. ""We’ll help you find a plan that’s right for you,"" the letter stated. A spokesman for Florida Blue, Mark Wright, told PolitiFact Florida that when it comes to getting new plans, ""nobody is throwing anybody off a cliff."" Not everyone’s policies expires on Jan. 1, those expirations will happen throughout the year. Consumers have to be notified that they have to choose a new plan 90 days before their plan expires. Jon Urbanek, a senior vice president at Florida Blue, told us the company intends to offer people with expiring policies a range of options. Depending on where they live and other factors, ""most people will have a choice of somewhere around 40 plans to choose from,"" Urbanek said. Health care experts We sent Rubio’s statement to a few health care experts to see if they thought it was accurate. What we generally heard was that while policy holders are losing that particular insurance plan, they do have other options. ""There is some truth to saying that they are losing their coverage plans they are now in -- they are no longer available,"" said Timothy Jost, a law professor at William and Lee and co-author of the casebook Health Law. ""Presumably those are plans with very high deductibles, high out-of-pocket costs."" However, ""it is also inaccurate saying people are losing coverage."" Christopher J. Conover, a health research scholar at Duke University and adjunct scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told PolitiFact Florida that these consumers are losing their current health plan. ""Most of your readers might interpret ‘losing coverage’ as meaning these individuals will become uninsured. Some in fact will be, but not the majority....,"" he said. Conover said that the same situation is happening to millions of consumers nationwide. ""This eventually will touch millions of Americans,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. Our ruling Rubio said, ""300,000 people are going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don’t have health insurance."" Rubio was referring to letters Florida Blue started sending to consumers in the individual market in August. The letters do tell consumers that their particular plan will end due to the Affordable Care Act. That’s because the plans typically don’t offer the comprehensive coverage that is required under the new law. However, the letters also state that consumers will have ""continuous health care coverage"" and assigned them a particular plan, or gave them the option to contact Florida Blue and choose another plan. So their coverage is not dependent on being able to buy insurance through healthcare.gov, the government’s online marketplace. We rate this claim Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB90BDC0>],/factchecks/2013/oct/25/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-said-florida-300000-people-are-going-l/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Pundits', ""Lawrence O'Donnell""]","
Lawrence O'Donnell says the IRS cannot pursue 'either civil or criminal remedies' for people who don’t purchase health insurance
","With the federal government’s online insurance marketplace floundering in its first month, some political pundits are calling for a delay of the hot-button provision requiring most people to pay a tax penalty if they don’t have health insurance. MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell is not one of them. Ever since the law passed, he has told his viewers to not fear the individual mandate. He said it again on The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell on Oct. 21, 2013 while scolding a White House correspondent. ""No one ever really has to pay the fine in the individual mandate,"" O’Donnell said, ""because the IRS has been specifically forbidden, in writing, in law, in the Affordable Care Act, from ever actually pursuing either civil or criminal remedies to collect those fines from anyone. The individual mandate is the only provision in the tax code that was written deliberately to be essentially unenforceable."" Don’t believe him? On air, O’Donnell pointed to page 131 of the law, which more or less states exactly what he said about IRS enforcement, or lack thereof, of the mandate. (He actually read the key sections aloud.) In 2014, uninsured taxpayers will pay a pro-rated fine of either 1 percent of annual income or $95, whichever is greater. It goes up each year, and there are more costs for uninsured dependents. There are some exemptions for religious beliefs, prisoners, Indian tribes, certain low incomes and undocumented immigrants. The final bill President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010 included two requirements that essentially yanked out the agency’s teeth in enforcing the mandate penalty. The IRS cannot pursue criminal charges against someone who does not pay the penalty and is supposed to. The agency also cannot file a notice of lien or seize property. ""The argument was we don't want the IRS harassing taxpayers to collect the penalty,"" said Roberton Williams, the Sol Price fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The health care law did not take away the agency’s ability to file a lawsuit against a delinquent taxpayer, though the amount of the penalty is so small that it would not be worth the trouble, said Bryan Camp, Texas Tech University School of Law professor who worked as an IRS lawyer from 1993-2001. The unpaid penalty could conceivably be part of broader legal action against a taxpayer owing a lot more in income taxes, he said, though filing lawsuits is hard enough for the agency because it has to go through the Department of Justice, which has other priorities, he said. The agency does have one way to collect the individual mandate penalty. It's through your tax refund. The IRS will send a notice to taxpayers who are required to pay the penalty but don’t. If the penalty is not paid, the IRS can take it out of a tax refund. Most people received a tax refund between $2,000 and $3,000 this year because their employer withheld too much from their paychecks, Williams said. That can only happen if a taxpayer is getting a refund. If they’re not getting a refund, there’s not much the IRS can do to make people pay the penalty beyond sending a letter. Taxpayers who don’t want to pay the penalty could tinker with the amount withheld from their paychecks so they don’t overpay the IRS, denying the agency the ability to hold back or minimize a refund. But experts said most taxpayers won’t go to the trouble. ""It’s a mandate that operates through inconvenience,"" said Jordan Barry, a University of San Diego School of Law professor who co-wrote an essay with Camp examining whether the mandate is really mandatory. ""It’s basically right that you could avoid this if you wanted to."" The penalty will still be in IRS records, but not paying it won’t hurt your credit report because there will be no notice of lien on file, said Jaime Vasquez, a tax attorney at the Houston law firm Chamberlain Hrdlicka. ""There’s interest that will grow on it, and if you’re getting any future refunds, those refunds will go toward offsetting that penalty plus any interest that has accrued in the meantime,"" he said. It will take time and possibly legal action to resolve some of the more complicated issues surrounding how the IRS can enforce the penalty, including an Obamacare tax ""rollover,"" said Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. We asked the IRS to fill us in on any regulations the agency adopted to enforce the mandate, but the agency did not get back to us by deadline. Our ruling Experts said O’Donnell’s point is pretty accurate: The IRS cannot use its most effective collection weapons -- the threat of jail time or seizing of property -- for the individual mandate penalty. But the law did not take away its power to pursue lawsuits against delinquent taxpayers, though experts say it isn’t likely given the small size of the penalty and current difficulty of filing suit outside of tax court. Plus, for taxpayers who overpay their income taxes and don’t pay the fine, the IRS could extract the penalty from a taxpayer’s refund. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8E71C0>],/factchecks/2013/oct/25/lawrence-odonnell/lawrence-odonnell-says-irs-cannot-pursue-either-ci/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'Greg Abbott']","
Davis has not threatened tax hikes, but favors review of state tax exemptions that might affect taxes
","Greg Abbott, the second-term Texas attorney general seeking to succeed Gov. Rick Perry in the 2014 election, paints the Democrat in the race as inclined to higher taxes. Abbott, a Republican, said on a Facebook page: ""Wendy Davis has entered the ring, threatening to raise taxes up to $35 billion to pay for new government spending. The Wendy Davis Agenda will bring California values to our state if we don’t stop her."" Abbott’s web page was brought to our attention by Austin political consultant Steven Rivas. To our inquiry, Abbott campaign spokesman Matt Hirsch said Abbott based his tax-threat statement on news stories reporting on the Fort Worth senator’s Sept. 29, 2013, appearance at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin. According to an Associated Press news story posted online that day, Davis said there that she opposes raising sales or property tax rates, ""but thinks the Legislature needs to review $35 billion in tax exemptions on the books."" Hirsch noted a similar online news post that day by Austin’s KXAN-TV, Channel 36, and pointed out an online news post by KERA-TV, Channel 13 in Dallas. We’ll explore the cited interview. First, let’s revisit what officials usually mean when they refer to such exemptions. In the latest annual accounting of state tax exemptions, state Comptroller Susan Combs reported in March 2013 that in the fiscal year running through August 2013, ""exemptions"" from state sales, franchise, gas and motor vehicle sales taxes will total nearly $38 billion, with sales-tax exemptions accounting for nearly $36 billion of that. Combs said those totals reflected both simple exemptions and a range of ways that taxes are not due, including ""exclusions, discounts, deductions, special accounting methods, credits, refunds, and special appraisals."" A straight-up exemption, Combs wrote, ""protects items that would be taxable except for specific provisions in the law. For example, since the Texas sales tax law taxes all sales of tangible personal property, groceries would be taxable if they were not specifically exempted."" Texas sales-tax exemptions include basic necessities such as groceries, residential gas and electric utilities, and prescription and over-the-counter drugs. Other sales are exempted when made to certain groups, Combs wrote. ""For example, governmental bodies and religious and nonprofit educational groups buy items for their own use tax-free. Other exemptions apply because the tax would be impractical to collect,"" she said. ""For example, those who make only occasional sales (one or two sales of taxable items per year) do not collect the tax; however, purchasers with permits are responsible for remitting the tax."" Some examples of purchases exempted from sales tax: sales of water, film production equipment, newspapers, magazine subscriptions, aircraft, certain court reporting services and even the first $25 of a monthly basic Internet connection fee. Other major taxes also have exemptions, according to the report. Insurance companies are exempt from the business franchise tax; they pay a tax on premiums. Nonprofits and certain cooperatives also are exempt from the franchise tax. Meanwhile, certain purchasers of gas are exempt from the state gas tax; they include licensed aviation fuel dealers, the federal government, Texas public school districts and volunteer fire departments. A video of the September interview of Davis by Evan Smith, the Tribune’s editor in chief, confirms that Davis endorsed a study of tax exemptions as a way of possibly generating more government revenue and that she also vowed to veto increases in sales or property taxes. Smith asked Davis about 20 minutes into the 38-minute interview: ""Do you believe that we have enough revenue in this state to meet all of our needs, not just on education but across the board?"" ""I believe that we do,"" Davis said, ""but I believe we have to really sit back and be thoughtful and smart about how we make our revenue and spending decisions. And a huge piece of that, of course, is the exemptions that we give in the state of Texas today."" The senator added that in the 2013 regular legislative session, she supported a proposal by Sens. John Carona, R-Dallas, and Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, ""asking us to take a serious look… at the $35-plus billion every biennium that we give up in loopholes and exemptions, setting aside, of course, property tax exemptions which I think are uniformly supported, but these other exemptions that exist in the state of Texas and to ask whether they still make sense."" Smith asked if Davis could specify a tax exemption that had ""run its course."" ""I really don’t feel like I can say that,"" Davis said. ""Because what we need instead is a uniform look, a very objective look, with the input of the Legislative Budget Board, the comptroller, the Legislature making those determinations, and receiving, of course, the input from our chambers of commerce and other business partners in Texas to make sure that we’re making good decisions in any changes that we would make."" Smith also asked if Davis was prepared to say Texas should not raise taxes for education or other purposes until it makes sure money is already properly spent. Davis said: ""I would certainly take a sales tax, a property tax increase off the table. Absolutely. If I had one day, someday, the privilege of being in a leadership position that could veto legislation like that, I would."" We asked Davis’ campaign about Abbott’s claim, and Davis spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña said by email that Davis in the 2013 session backed Senate Bill 140, which was authored by Carona and Ellis and co-authored by three other senators, though not Davis, according to legislative records. Acuña told us by email that Davis ""supports a process in which the comptroller and the Legislature can review tax preferences to make sure they're continuing to help small businesses and our economy."" SB 140, which died at the committee level, called for reviews of statutory ""tax preferences,"" meaning any credit, discount, exclusion, exemption, refund, special valuation, special accounting treatment, special rate or special method of reporting as authorized in relation to a state or local tax imposed in the state. Under the proposal, the budget board would determine each tax preference’s purpose every six years and evaluate if it accomplishes its purpose and if it is ""inefficient, ineffective or unnecessary, or if the intended purpose of the tax preference is a low priority"" for the state, also evaluating the effect of the preference on economic development, the number of high-wage jobs, funding for public services, the distribution of the tax burden by income class and total income by income class in the state. Board recommendations would then be considered by Texas House and Senate budget-writing committees, which would recommend changes to each preference, including its repeal, the proposal said. Finally, it called for any legislated tax preferences newly taking effect after August 2014 to automatically expire six years later unless lawmakers deemed otherwise. Also as noted by Acuña, Davis voted for a slimmed version of the proposal offered by Ellis as a floor amendment to two measures that won unanimous Senate approval May 21, 2013, according to the Texas Senate Journal. The revised language, adopted both times by voice votes, called for the budget board to review tax preferences every 12 years and estimate each preference’s effects on government revenue, the economy and tax burdens borne by individuals and businesses, among facets. The floor amendment did not call for the board or legislative panels to make recommendations to amend or abolish tax preferences. In the end, though,  House Bill 500, related to the franchise tax, and HB 3390, related to the Texas Economic Development Act, passed into law without the Senate-added provisions about tax preferences surviving, according to legislative records. Our ruling Abbott said Davis is threatening to raise taxes up to $35 billion. If Texas eliminated every exemption as defined by the state comptroller, it’s reasonable to speculate that tax revenues would increase about $38 billion a year. But Davis isn’t calling for an across-the-board repeal. In the cited interview, she didn’t even identify an exemption she believes has run its course. Rather, she favors a study involving legislative and public input before final decisions, which at the least leaves resulting tax effects unknown. Abbott’s claim has an element of truth, but generally ignores critical facts that would give an accurate impression. We rate this statement as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'Nancy Jester']","
Ex-DeKalb school official says state's spending, results don't match
","Since Nancy Jester’s departure from the DeKalb County school board, she has kept busy. She hosts a radio show focused on education. And she’s still a fixture on the DeKalb education scene, with an active website and blog about the district’s issues and all things education related. Earlier this month, Jester took her ideas to The Marietta Daily Journal for an op-ed about the controversial Common Core national education standards. ""Our state spends in the top 10 nationally on education, yet, most of our education metrics hover in the bottom five. We have to admit that we need a change in leadership on educational issues in Georgia,"" Jester said. ""… Georgia has a long road ahead but Common Core is not a path to prosperity."" It is important to note that Georgia was the ninth most populous state in the nation, at the last census count in 2010. And the Peach State also had the eighth most K-12 students in the country. So, having a lot of students would equal more education spending. We wanted to determine whether Jester was correct on the state’s education finances and student achievement, so we hit the books for answers. Jester, who is considering a run for state school superintendent, told us she got her information from 2010 census reports. We reviewed the Census Bureau’s public education finance report for that year, which included public school spending data by state. Using the aggregate spending figure -- including money from federal, state and local sources -- Jester was correct. Georgia spent the 10th most on education in fiscal 2010, at $15.7 billion. California, New York, Texas, Illinois, New Jersey, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan spent more than Georgia. A census researcher also led us to the 2011 education finance report for more recent figures. Again, on aggregate spending, Georgia ranked 10th, with the same states from the previous year rounding out the other top positions. Jester’s claim is based on overall education spending, but Georgia’s rank drops substantially in those years, to 33rd and 35th respectively, when per-pupil spending is considered, according to census reports. When adjusted for regional costs of living, Georgia ranked worse at 38th nationally for per-pupil spending in 2012. We next turned to education metrics. Jester didn’t mention specific benchmarks, but generally ACT and SAT scores, and graduation rates are used to measure state performance through student achievement. We checked the U.S. Department of Education’s state-by-state graduation rates for the 2010-2011 school year (the most recent available). Georgia’s four-year graduation rate was 67 percent that year, lower than every state except Nevada and New Mexico. The low rate that year was partly attributed to the DOE’s new four-year calculation, implemented nationally for the first time, and based on how many ninth-graders graduate with a standard diploma within four years. Before the new calculation, some states included students in their graduation rates who took longer to receive their diplomas. Under the old calculation, Georgia had an 81 percent graduation rate in the 2009-2010 school year. We then looked at ACT scores. In 2013, about 51 percent of Georgia graduates took the ACT, combining for a state composite score of 20.7, out of a possible score of 36. (The national average composite score for that year was 20.9.) Georgia’s scores were not in the bottom five among other states this year, nor in 2012 when the state’s students also achieved a 20.7 composite score. We also examined Georgia’s scores on the other popular college admissions test, the SAT, administered by the College Board. On that test, Georgia’s average score from 2012 to 2013 was flat, at 1452 out of 2400 possible points. The state score was below the national SAT average score of 1498 for both years. The Commonwealth Foundation, a free-market think tank in Pennsylvania, compiled SAT data for 2013, which listed Georgia as 45th in the nation based on its scores. Georgia is considered a high-participation state for the SAT, with 75 percent of students taking the test this year. The Peach State ranked just above the bottom five in that list, but close enough to support Jester’s claim. We also considered the Education Weekly’s annual Quality Counts reports that focuses on state efforts in education. This year, Georgia ranked seventh among states with a B- rating of 81.0 out of a possible 100 points. (The 2013 national average was a C+, 76.9 rating.) Georgia received the same rank and letter grade in 2012. The report tracks six areas of policy and performance. Georgia received A’s in the areas of Transitions and Alignment and Standards, Assessments, and Accountability. But received C’s in the areas of K-12 Achievement, Chance for Success and School Finance. So does Jester’s claim earn a passing grade? She is correct that Georgia spends in the top 10 nationally for public K-12 spending. But Georgia is also in the top 10 nationally for the number of K-12 students in the state, so a high level of spending is expected. It is also important to note that Georgia’s ranking drops significantly, to the bottom third of all states, for per-pupil spending. National results of college readiness exams and graduation rates ranked Georgia among the bottom in most reports. Georgia did rank in the top 10 states nationally in a survey touted by state education officials. But even in that report, Georgia scored low marks in key areas, including student achievement. Jester’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details about education funding that could give the reader a different impression. We rate Jester’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCAC780>],/factchecks/2013/oct/25/nancy-jester/ex-dekalb-school-official-says-states-spending-res/

Congress, criminals, Scientologists and other groups are exempt from Obamacare, claims Facebook post
","Internet memes are great for quickly spreading jokes and important information. And because they’re also efficient at sharing inflammatory falsehoods, they keep us busy here at PolitiFact. When a reader emailed us a graphic he came across on Facebook about which groups are exempt from Obamacare, our warning bells went off. Under the headline, ""Where is your OPT OUT? Let’s get this straight, it doesn’t exist,"" a long list claims to show who is and is not exempt from the health care law, which requires everybody to have insurance beginning in 2014. Groups like Congress and the White House, criminals and Muslims are listed as exempt, according to the graphic. Catholics, Jews and ""you"" are not. At the end, the list emphasizes, ""Christians In General NO Exemption."" In addition to making the rounds on Facebook lately, we’ve found the graphic on several websites like Liberal Logic 101. It’s hard to tell when and where it originated. A few of the items on the list are actually accurate. A lot of it, though, is plain wrong. Let’s break this down piece by piece. Government officials PolitiFact is no stranger to the ""Congress is exempt"" claim. Ted Cruz and others have claimed lawmakers either have an exemption or are trying to get one. We’ve found no truth to that.  Lawmakers and their staffs are actually singled out, forced off their employer-provided insurance and sent into the health care marketplaces. (In their case, their employer is the federal government.) Members of Congress and staff will receive their traditional employer contribution to put toward a plan from the marketplaces. It’s a special circumstance, but it’s not a pass by any means. They still need to get insurance like everyone else. Although the graphic only lists Democrats like Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi, it’s important to note that all lawmakers have the same obligation to buy insurance, regardless of political affiliation. So Democratic and Republican lawmakers are treated alike under the law. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden are a different story, said David Howard, an Emory University health policy professor. They’re eligible for many different health coverage options, and can choose go to the Bethesda Naval Hospital. Like everyone else, they would be fined if they didn’t have any health insurance. Criminals Incarcerated criminals are exempt from the penalty for not having insurance. That’s because it’s the prison’s responsibility to provide health care to its inmates. The Affordable Care Act specifically indicates that ""incarcerated individuals excluded."" The specific care prisoners receive varies by state, but generally speaking, prisoners get regular check-ups (typically not frequently) and emergency care. This technically isn’t considered insurance. American Indians American Indians are also exempt from the individual mandate, so members of federally recognized tribes will not be fined. They don’t have insurance, but they do get health care through the Indian Health Service, according to Leighton Ku, the director of George Washington University’s Center for Health Policy Research. They have a long-standing treaty with the federal government guaranteeing them health care. The Indian Health Service is a federal agency that provides care to American Indians and Alaska Natives. Although they won’t be fined for not enrolling in plans through the marketplace if they are eligible for IHS care, they can still choose to do so at any time. Religious groups The meme targets a whole host of religious groups. The Amish, Scientologists, Christian Scientists and Muslims are categorized as exempt, but Baptists, Catholics, Lutherans and Jews are not. But that’s not really accurate. The law doesn’t contain specific language about which denominations or religions would qualify for an exemption, but it does specify that individuals belonging to religious groups for exemptions if they have religious beliefs opposed to health insurance or medical treatment. These kinds of exemptions exist for other federal programs, and there are rules for determining who qualifies. Based on who has obtained exemptions from other federal programs like Medicare and Social Security, it looks like the Amish would qualify, as would Mennonites. The assertion that an exemption for Muslims is specified in the law is wrong -- Pants on Fire wrong. Scientologists typically have no objection to medical treatment for physical ailments. Our ruling This Internet meme rattles of a list of groups that are and are not exempt from the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act. Most of the claims are way off-base, but we found some facts buried among the falsehoods. Obama and Biden don’t need to buy insurance on the marketplaces, but they’re not exempt from fines if they don’t have coverage. Prisoners and American Indians are in fact exempt, but they still have health care of some sort. Members of small number of religious groups can receive exemptions if they have formal objections to medical care or health insurance, but we found no evidence that Muslims or Scientologists meet that criteria. Because most of the list is wrong, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD57BC0>],/factchecks/2013/oct/24/facebook-posts/congress-criminals-scientologists-and-other-groups/

Are there more people living in poverty now than there were 50 years ago?
","When Bend Rep. Jason Conger announced that he will seek the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in hopes of squaring off against Sen. Jeff Merkley, he outlined his stance on several issues, including poverty. It’s a timely topic, especially given that a potential crisis could be brewing with regard to food stamp funding. A recession-era boost to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expires Nov. 1, meaning all recipients will see their benefits drop. Plus, lawmakers are considering additional cuts to the program, which has seen considerable growth in recent years.   That’s all just context, though, for what we’re really interested in. During his announcement, Conger maintained that the long-running War on Poverty (which involves programs such as SNAP) has failed to make much difference. In fact, he said, things are worse than before. ""We’ve been fighting a war on poverty for 50 years and we failed,"" he said. ""There are actually more people in poverty now than there were when we started. We’re spending a trillion dollars on safety net programs. … Does anyone think for any reason that just throwing more money into that same system is going to change the result? Of course not."" Now, folks have probably dedicated careers to trying to determine whether the War on Poverty has succeeded in any meaningful way. Certainly, it’s too complicated a question for a single PolitiFact. But one thing PolitiFact Oregon could check was whether there are ""actually more people in poverty now than there were when we started."" The whole concept of the War on Poverty dates to 1964 when President Lyndon B. Johnson introduced legislation that, among other things, created Medicare and Medicaid, and gave permanence to the food stamp program. The U.S. Census Bureau has been keeping an eye on poverty for decades, stretching back even before Johnson’s reforms. So figures were easy to come by. In the bureau's most recent report on poverty, a helpful graph shows both the number of folks in poverty and the poverty rate (which takes into account the growing population). The two graphs tell different stories, depending on how you read them. In terms of whole numbers, Conger is right. About 36 million folks were living in poverty in 1964, and about 46.5 million folks live in poverty today -- obviously an increase. However, if you consider the other graph, you’ll find the poverty rate was 19 percent in 1964 and is about 15 percent now. Truth be told, the rate has been fairly stagnant ever since a drop in the 1960s. We spoke with Conger about his decision to go with the raw figures over the rate. It came down to accuracy, he said. The more he looked into comparing rates over time, he said, the less he was certain he’d be comparing ""apples to apples."" ""I didn’t want to distort it or anything,"" Conger said. ""I used the raw number because I know that’s true."" He also pointed out that he could have done something sensational. He could have, for instance, said the number of people living in poverty grew by more than 20 percent since the War on Poverty began, but he said he knew that would be alarmist. ""I deliberately didn't do that because I was just trying to make a point."" Now, we’ve done our share of looks at poverty during our time with PolitiFact Oregon, and we know this is a complicated issue. So we turned to an expert, Beth Mattingly, a researcher with the Stanford Center for the Study of Poverty and Inequality. The big difficulty with measuring poverty, she said, is that while programs aimed at fighting poverty have increased, the government’s method for measuring poverty, which is heavily focused on an individual's cash resources, has not. That means the rate does not take into account several types of assistance, specifically the types Conger was calling ineffective. Non-cash transfers such as food stamps, energy assistance and nutrition programs for women and children don’t get counted. Neither does the earned income tax credit, one of the bigger tools used for fighting poverty. ""The official poverty number hasn't declined dramatically,"" Mattingly said, ""but it means something different today than it did before the War on Poverty."" Folks who research poverty, including employees of the U.S. Census Bureau, have tried different ways of looking at the poverty rate. One that Mattingly suggested we take a look at is called the Supplemental Poverty Measure, which does pull together the various types of assistance. The measure also takes into account necessary costs to a family or individual, for instance health care or transportation. The idea is that it would offer a more comprehensive measure. Unfortunately, that measure has been around only a few years and doesn’t give us a direct comparison between now and 1964. So back to our ruling. Conger is correct that more people are in poverty now than in 1964 in terms of raw numbers. But if you look at the rate, which takes population growth into account, we’ve experienced an overall drop. The rate itself, of course, is not perfect, but that seems to be the fairest measure over time, even if it doesn’t take into account many of the programs that came a result of the War on Poverty. Conger’s statement is accurate but needs that clarification. We rate this claim Mostly True.

Former governor says Wisconsin not as obese as national average
","Editor’s note: On Oct. 7, 2013, we rated this statement True. Several readers cited additional information we hadn’t considered, so we have issued a new rating. Since losing to Democrat Tammy Baldwin in a U.S. Senate race in 2012, former Republican Wisconsin governor and U.S. health and human services secretary Tommy Thompson has put energy into getting the nation into better shape. Thompson -- who, at 70, showed during the campaign he could do 50 push-ups -- gave a speech in Madison on Sept. 25, 2013, about obesity in America. In an interview the same day with WISC-TV (Channel 3) in Madison, Thompson made a claim that might surprise those us who push our love handles out of the way to make sure we don’t miss a belt loop. After Thompson stated that ""we are not very healthy in America,"" one of his interviewers said, ""Well, in Wisconsin, it’s a particular battle. We’re always battling. We’re one of the fattest states in the country."" Thompson responded by saying: ""Yes, we are (battling),"" he said. ""But you know something, but you look at the statistics, and across the board, and Wisconsin is not as obese as the national average is. The national average, 35.7 percent of the population is obese. In Wisconsin, it's closer to 26 percent. ""So, one out of four, versus one out of three. That’s still not very good, but the truth of the matter is, we’re healthier. But we have to do a better job, in Wisconsin as well as across the country."" Beer-bellied Wisconsin has less-than-average obesity? What’s ""obese?"" We went to the CDC, a corner tavern, to check on Thompson’s claim. Just kidding. CDC, of course, is short for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It defines obesity as something less than you might imagine. Height and weight are used to calculate a body mass index. Your BMI determines whether you’re considered obese. An adult, male or female, who is 5-feet-9 and 203 pounds or more is considered obese. The CDC notes that although BMI is correlated with body fat, BMI doesn’t actually measure body fat. So, some people, such as athletes, may have a body mass index that identifies them as overweight even though they do not have excess body fat. At the same time, obesity is associated with heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Now, that Uncle Sam has us feeling unduly chubby, let’s check Thompson’s claim against the statistics. Apples and oranges On a national level, CDC calculates obesity rates by weighing and measuring a sampling of the population. The most recent figures are from a January 2012 report. In 2009-2010, an estimated 35.7 percent of U.S. adults were obese. No estimates using measurements are done for the various states. Conversely, at the state level, height and weight are self-reported by Americans who participate in phone surveys conducted by state health departments. This type of study can produce lower-than-reality obesity rates, according to CDC, because some people overstate their height and understate their weight. Indeed, in the phone surveys, no state had an obesity rate above the 35.7 percent found in the national survey in which people were actually measured. The CDC told us that, given the different methodologies, comparing the two studies would be like comparing apples to oranges. The latest state data available when Thompson made his statement was for 2012. Based on the responses in the phone survey, 29.7 percent of Wisconsin residents were rated obese. Nationwide, the figure was 28.1 percent. So, Wisconsin’s obesity rate was slightly higher than the national rate in the telephone survey study. That gives a very different impression that what Thompson said. Meanwhile, here’s how Wisconsin's 29.7 percent obesity rate in the phone survey compared with neighboring states: Michigan (31.1 percent), Iowa (30.4 percent), Illinois (28.1 percent) and Minnesota (25.7 percent). Our rating Thompson said: ""Wisconsin is not as obese as the national average is. The national average, 35.7 percent of the population is obese. In Wisconsin, it's closer to 26 percent."" In one study, 35.7 percent of American adults were estimated to be obese. In another study, which used a different methodology, the rate was 28.1 percent, slightly below Wisconsin’s 29.7 percent. The percentages cited by Thompson contain an element of truth, but the conclusion he drew isn’t valid because the two studies can’t be compared, so we rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBE9140>],/factchecks/2013/oct/24/tommy-thompson/former-governor-says-wisconsin-not-obese-national-/

Sean Hannity says health insurance premiums up 99 percent for men, 62 percent for women
","If the rollout of the Obamacare website had gone well, we likely would be closer to having an answer to the all-important question: How much are people paying for health insurance and is it more than they did before? But for now, getting reliable answers can be treacherous. Conservative talk radio and Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity waded into the discussion on his radio program. A caller voiced frustration with the lack of jobs. Here’s the conversation that followed: Hannity: You know what the biggest job killer in the country is right now? Obamacare. Caller: One thing that can't be argued is that insurance premiums are too high. Hannity: They are skyrocketing. They are skyrocketing. I mean, in 45 out of 50 states, on average men are seeing their premiums double, going up 99 percent. Women up 62 percent. That's the average. Are Hannity's numbers right? Hannity’s staff told us the numbers came from an article in Forbes that provided the analysis of some number crunching by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative New York think tank. But Hannity's on-air statement went further than the report itself and included a common mistake. He lumped in people who purchase insurance on their own with people who receive it through their employer. The study focused explicitly on the insurance rates people can expect to encounter in the online marketplaces, which makes up less than 10 percent of the total private insurance market. Of that small subgroup, Hannity also failed to acknowledge that federal government subsidies will reduce many people’s out-of-pocket expenses, at least partially offsetting higher premiums. The Manhattan Institute study The Manhattan Institute analysts went through a complex process to estimate how premiums under Obamacare compared to premiums before the marketplaces opened. It drilled down to the county level in all 50 states and used a federal government website to gather health insurance prices in 2013 (before the Obamacare rollout). It looked at rates for 27-, 40-, and 64-year-old male and female non-smokers and adjusted prices upward to account for anyone who was denied coverage or had some health problem that would increase their rates. Then, the researchers looked at the prices for plans in the marketplaces for comparable individuals. The results were daunting. ""The cheapest exchange plan for the average enrollee, compared to what a 40-year-old would pay today, will cost an average of 99 percent more for men, and 62 percent for women,"" the study said. The Manhattan Institute analysis refers only to people buying insurance through the marketplaces, which is called the ""individual market."" This is in contrast to the way that most Americans, about two-thirds, get insurance. They get coverage through their employer. The number of people in the individual market is expected to grow under the new health care law but right now, they represent less than 10 percent of people with insurance. We should note that the Manhattan Institute analysis relies on knowing how much people pay for insurance today, before Obamacare. That is something that a leading health policy research center has declined to do. The Kaiser Family Foundation’s Larry Levitt said there are several reasons not to compare cost before and after Obamacare. Part of the challenge is the new health care law requires that insurance plans include more services than many do today, such as maternity care and mental health coverage. That means the plans people will buy in 2014 are not the same as the ones they bought in 2013. And because the coverage is changing, apples-to-apples comparisons are challenging. Levitt said another major obstacle to before-and-after comparisons is that reliable data is unavailable. Insurance companies would have a key piece, but they keep it to themselves. ""There is not good information about what people pay in the individual insurance market today,"" Levitt said. ""And we certainly don’t know what types of plans people are going to choose after reform. Generally, Kaiser has predicted that premiums will be ""somewhat higher"" in the individual market than what they are today. The additional services come at a price. In addition, no one can be denied due to a pre-existing condition. Insuring them will tend to increase an insurance plan's costs. That might be offset if plenty of younger, healthy people also join the insurance pool, a stated goal of Obamacare but also one of the great unknowns. Federal subsidies The Congressional Budget Office, the research arm of Congress, projects that about half the people buying health insurance through the marketplaces will be eligible for subsidies in the form of tax credits. The more money you make, the less the subsidy. No subsidies are available for an individual making more than $43,000 a year, or a family of four making about $92,000 a year. The Manhattan Institute average rate increases for men and women did not factor in any subsidies. Our ruling Hannity said premiums are skyrocketing and the average man would pay twice as much, while the increase for the average woman would be 62 percent. That claim relies on a study that focused on the individual marketplaces for insurance set up under Obamacare, a  subset of people who purchase insurance. Regardless of the accuracy of the analysis, it spoke to the experience of a small minority of Americans, and it did not factor in the subsidies that will cushion some people from increased premiums. Hannity overreached in his remarks on radio. That said, new rules for insurance plans will tend to push some rates up -- because the plans must provide better coverage. But by how much depends on a host of factors that several leading health policy experts say is too difficult to estimate. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE58500>],/factchecks/2013/oct/24/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-says-average-man-will-see-his-premium/

How much is the federal government involved in the Common Core school standards?
","In June 2010, Wisconsin became one of the first states to adopt Common Core, a set of national education standards for English and math. Over time, nearly every state jumped aboard. Not much controversy. But more recently, Common Core has come under attack from conservatives around the country. U.S. Senate Republicans, for example, tried in April 2013 to kill federal funding for the program, calling it an interference with local control of public schools. In Wisconsin, GOP state lawmakers set hearings to review the standards; the next is Oct. 30, 2013. At the first hearing, on Oct. 3, 2013, state schools superintendent Tony Evers -- the official who decided Wisconsin would adopt Common Core -- told a reporter that the pushback in Madison and elsewhere ""is all about what's going on in Washington. It's all about controlling the message and the next (presidential) election."" The same day, state Rep. Sondy Pope (D-Cross Plains) took a break from the hearing to defend Common Core on ""The Devil's Advocates"" talk show on WXXM-FM (92.1) in Madison. Asked whether Common Core means schools are forced to teach children based on ""federalized standards,"" Pope said, ""absolutely not."" ""This is not from the federal government. This is not ‘ObamaCore.,’"" she said. ""This came straight from the (National) Governors Association, of which (Gov. Scott Walker) is a member, and the state school chiefs -- the superintendents -- association, absolutely separate from anything that the federal government was doing. ""They do not have their fingerprints on this thing at all."" Is Pope right that Common Core didn’t come from the federal government and that federal officials don’t have their fingerprints on it? Common Core and its origins Adopted by 45 states, the Common Core State Standards came out of years of discussion between private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. In Wisconsin, the standards will be aligned with a new standardized test that will roll out in 2014. Common Core’s website explicitly states that the federal government was not involved in developing the standards. And there is other evidence to support that. As PolitiFact Florida has noted, the Council of Chief State School Officers -- a national organization of public officials who head state education departments -- discussed developing common standards during its annual policy forum in 2007, a year before Barack Obama won the presidency. In 2009, the council and the National Governors Association agreed to create the Common Core State Standards, developed them with the help of teachers, parents, and experts, and unveiled them in 2010.    So, Pope is accurate on the first part of her claim, that Common Core did not come from the federal government. Federal involvement PolitiFact Florida also addressed the second part of Pope’s claim -- that federal officials ""do not have their fingerprints"" on Common Core. Our colleagues found that, although Common Core is voluntary for states to adopt, the federal government has had a role in encouraging them to adopt the standards. To get grants from Race to the Top -- Obama’s signature education program -- or waivers from the mandates of No Child Left Behind -- an education reform law adopted under President George W. Bush -- states have to prove they have standards to prepare students for college and work. They don’t have to adopt the Common Core Standards, but that works as one way to qualify for grants or waivers. There was a rush by states to adopt Common Core by August 2010 because establishing standards won them points in the competition for a share of the billions in Race to the Top grants. Tom McCarthy, a spokesman for Pope, acknowledged ""there really wasn’t a credible alternative to Common Core"" at the time. So, the federal government didn’t force Common Core on the states, but it did create incentives for states to adopt the standards. Our rating Pope said: Common Core ""is not from the federal government,"" they ""do not have their fingerprints on this thing at all."" Federal officials did not initiate the state standards for public schools or force them on the states. But they have given states financial incentives to adopt the standards. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, we give Pope a Mostly True.

Maine Gov. Paul LePage says 47 percent of able-bodied Maine residents aren't working
","Maine’s Republican governor, Paul LePage, has a history of making controversial comments, from telling the NAACP that the group can ""kiss my butt"" to charging that a Democratic legislative leader ""claims to be for the people but he’s the first one to give it to the people without providing Vaseline."" Recently, LePage made another comment that has attracted national attention. On Oct. 22, 2013, a blogger for the Bangor Daily News posted an audio clip from a speech LePage made in Falmouth, Maine. Here’s what the blogger wrote: ""Informed that the event was wrapping up, LePage said he had two more points to make. The first was just one word: ‘energy.’ The second was, he said, in reference to ‘workforce development.’ ""‘About 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don’t work,’ said LePage. ""On the recording you can hear a member of the audience ask, ‘What?’ LePage repeats himself. ‘About 47 percent. It’s really bad.’"" The blog post inspired a flurry of media attention, in part because LePage’s comment echoed the one from the 2012 presidential campaign in which Republican nominee Mitt Romney said that 47 percent of the American people are ""dependent upon government."" Romney’s comment was widely considered a blunder that hampered his bid for the White House. But what about the substance of LePage’s remark? Was he correct that ""about 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don’t work""? The strength or weakness of Maine’s labor market isn’t out of the mainstream; the unemployment rate in August 2013 was 7.0 percent, putting it in a six-way tie for 22nd place nationally. We contacted LePage’s press office for supporting evidence, but no one responded. A spokeswoman for LePage did send Huffington Post a statement, saying in part that ""the governor understands that not everyone who is dependent on taxpayer dollars is 'able-bodied,' but he does believe that everyone, regardless of their ability or physical condition, can contribute to society in a meaningful way."" The Census Bureau found that Maine’s estimated population in 2012 was 1,329,192. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that in August 2013, Maine had 659,059 people employed. So by the roughest calculation, Maine had 670,133 people not working, or about 50 percent. This number would suggest that LePage is in the ballpark. But calling this a ""rough"" calculation is too kind. It’s actually a silly way of calculating it. First, doing it this way suggests that everybody -- no matter how old or young -- should be working. The numbers change dramatically if you exclude Maine residents up to age 18 and over 65 from the statistics. In 2012, Maine’s 18-to-64 population was 836,898. Using this as the denominator means that about 21 percent of Maine residents were not working. What about LePage’s reference to ""able-bodied people""? The Census Bureau has estimated that in 2011, Maine had 101,000 people aged 18 to 64 who have a ""health problem or disability which prevents them from working or which limits the kind or amount of work they can do."" If you subtract this group, then there were 735,898 ""able-bodied people"" age 18 to 64 in Maine, and only 10 percent of them were not working. Finally, in August 2013, there were 49,966 unemployed people in Maine. These are people who have looked for work recently but have not found it. If you add these to the number of employed Maine residents, then just 3.6 percent of able-bodied Maine residents aged 18 to 64 are neither working nor actively looking for employment. That’s far off from the 47 percent LePage claimed. It’s possible to quibble about the specifications we’ve used, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. For instance, you could get a bit closer to LePage’s 47 percent figure if you counted 16- and 17-year olds or people up to age 74, who have been working in growing numbers in recent years. Still, Burtless said, ""even if you tried to include all the ‘able-bodied’ Maine residents past 65 in your calculations, I'm pretty confident you'd find Gov. LePage's claim to be ridiculous."" Our ruling LePage said that ""about 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don’t work."" Unless LePage thinks newborns and nonagenarians ought to get off their tushes and find a job, this is a ridiculous claim. In reality, only about 10 percent of able-bodied Maine residents aged 18 to 64 aren’t employed. And if you include those who are actively looking for work but who can’t find a job in today’s poor economy, the figure drops as low as 3.6 percent.
