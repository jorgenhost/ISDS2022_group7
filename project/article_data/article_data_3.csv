She failed, then followed Bill
","In an article for a conservative Internet journal that has been widely distributed via chain e-mail, former Clinton adviser-turned-foe Dick Morris points out a little-known embarrassment about Sen. Hillary Clinton, who was a star law student at Yale.
 
""She flunked the D.C. bar exam and only passed the Arkansas bar,"" he wrote.
 
It's true.
 
In his biography of Hillary Clinton, former Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein notes that in the summer of 1973, 817 people took the Washington, D.C., bar exam; 551 of them passed. Hillary Rodham was not one of them.
 
""For the first time in her life she had flamed out — spectacularly, given the expectations of others for her, and even more so her own,"" Bernstein wrote.
 
Bernstein said Clinton kept the news hidden for 30 years and shocked some of her closest friends when she made the revelation with a passing reference in her 2003 autobiography,

Living History.

She even spins it into a positive.
 
""Despite the satisfaction of my work, I was lonely and missed Bill more than I could stand,"" she wrote. ""I had taken both the Arkansas and Washington, D.C., bar exams during the summer, but my heart was pulling me toward Arkansas. When I learned that I passed in Arkansas but failed in D.C., I thought that maybe my test scores were telling me something.""
 
So she followed Bill Clinton to Arkansas. She became a faculty member in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, where Bill Clinton also taught. And in 1975, the two married.
 
Wrote Bernstein: ""There can only be conjecture about what turn her life — and the nation's — might have taken had she not failed the exam.""
 
But she did, and this statement is True.

McCain knew it would get him in trouble
","James Dobson, an evangelical leader who founded the conservative Christian group Focus on the Family, says he cannot support Sen. John McCain. He has gone so far as to say he will not vote for the first time in his life this November if McCain is the Republican nominee.
 
In a statement read by Laura Ingraham on her radio show, Dobson attacked McCain's conservative credentials, specifically his collegiality with Democrats. Dobson emphasized that the statement was his personal opinion, not that of Focus on the Family.
 
""I am convinced Sen. McCain is not a conservative, and in fact, has gone out of his way to stick his thumb in the eyes of those who are,"" the statement reads. ""He has at times sounded more like a member of the other party. McCain actually considered leaving the GOP in 2001, and approached John Kerry about being Kerry's running mate in 2004. McCain also said publicly that Hillary Clinton would make a good president. Given these and many other concerns, a spoonful of sugar does not make the medicine go down. I cannot, and I will not vote for Sen. John McCain, as a matter of conscience.""
 
We've addressed a claim on McCain being considered as a running mate to John Kerry

here.

So we'll focus on Dobson's claim that McCain once said Sen. Clinton would make a good president.
 
According to a transcript of

Meet the Press,

Dobson is right.
 
Wrapping up a Feb. 20, 2005, appearance from Baghdad during a joint trip, the senators praised each other in a light-hearted exchange. McCain even ended the interview by acknowledging what trouble he'd gotten into.
 
Russert: ""Senator McCain, a serious question: Do you think the lady to your right would make a good president?""
 
Clinton: ""Oh, we can't hear you, Tim. We can't hear you.""
 
McCain: ""Yeah, you're breaking up. I am sure that Senator Clinton would make a good president. I happen to be a Republican and would support, obviously, a Republican nominee, but I have no doubt that Senator Clinton would make a good president.""
 
Russert: ""Equal time, Senator Clinton. The gentleman to your left?""
 
Clinton: ""Absolutely.""
 
Russert: ""We may have a fusion ticket right here.""
 
McCain: ""Thanks for doing that to us. Thanks for doing that to us, Tim.""
 
No spin in that exchange. We judge Dobson's statement to be True.

Hunk of burning love
","Its presidential nominee all but announced, the Republican National Committee is ready for the next challenge: love note writing.
 
In a feature on its

Web site,

the RNC offers up free gifts for Valentine's Day. That is, cards from your favorite Democratic opponents.
 
""If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put T and AX together,"" coos a sweet valentine from Sen. Hillary Clinton.
 
""My liberal heart bleeds for you,"" intones Sen. Barack Obama.
 
Six options await the last-minute shopper — and you can send it to 10 people at once!
 
Many can appreciate the messages' snide sentiments, but here's the problem: While most of the Valentines are cute twists on criticisms of the two candidates, one is simply untrue.
 
It's a Clinton valentine that reads: ""Roses are red, violets are blue, I'll raise your taxes and there is nothing you can do.""
 
PolitiFact checked an earlier claim from the RNC that Clinton's campaign proposals would cost taxpayers more than $777.6-billion. We found that to be

Mostly True.

And Clinton has said she supports letting the Bush tax cuts of 2001 expire as scheduled in 2010 for people making more than $250,000 a year. Critics point to that as a sign she plans to raise taxes as president.
 
But it's the ""there is nothing you can do"" line that draws the Truth-O-Meter's attention.
 
Since when can a president raise taxes without the approval of Congress? And aren't voters encouraged to speak up about policies they oppose?
 
We gave a Pants on Fire ruling to former presidential candidate John Edwards when he claimed

king-like powers

for the presidency. The RNC now makes a similar claim.
 
Maybe the RNC should stick to the biting sarcasm of such sentiments as ""On this Valentine's Day ... may higher taxes come your way!"" (a Clinton card offering) or ""Will you be my Valentine? Yes ... no ... present"" (a shot at Obama's voting record in the Illinois state Senate).
 
Or consider adding fact sheets with footnotes to its Valentines. For this day, it's Pants on Fire wrong.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Yes, but it's complicated.
","Trying to depict her chief rival as calculating and wishy-washy, Sen. Hillary Clinton says Sen. Barack Obama ducked tough votes over eight years as an Illinois state senator by voting ""present"" instead of ""yea"" or ""nay"" 129 times on bills dealing with issues including abortion rights, gun control and the privacy of sex-abuse victims.
 
She questions whether Obama would be capable of making tough choices in the Oval Office.
 
""On issue after issue that really were hard to explain or understand, you voted present . . . And anytime anyone raises that, there's always some kind of explanation,"" Clinton said in her most direct attack, during a Jan. 21 Democratic debate in South Carolina.
 
Indeed, Obama regularly exercised this option during his time in the Springfield state house, though he did so in a chamber where voting ""present"" is a common strategic maneuver. Moreover, Obama clearly articulated his position on issues such as abortion before and after the votes.
 
""Everyone I've spoken to who's familiar with this, including lobbyists and people who are engaged in opposition research, say the number of times he voted present on a proportional basis was probably a little less than average,"" said Christopher Mooney, a political scientist at the University of Illinois at Springfield.
 
Obama had no such worries coming from a solidly Democratic district on Chicago's south side. But his aides and political allies say he provided strategic cover for other Democrats by voting present on Republican proposals. It worked like this: Republicans controlled the state Senate for much of Obama's tenure and GOP leaders often forced votes on social issues such as abortion restrictions that put some Democrats in swing districts in a difficult position. By voting ""present,"" Obama, a known abortion rights proponent who represented a safe Democratic district, made it more acceptable for Democrats in swing districts to vote present as well, sparing them the pain of a straight ""no"" vote that would open them up to election-year attacks.
 
And a ""present"" vote could sometimes work as well as a ""no"" in stalling legislation.
 
The down side to all this maneuvering is that Obama is seen as having shown up but not taken a position on measures such as a proposal to allow juveniles as young as 15 to be tried as adults if they committed a crime with a firearm near or on school grounds. He similarly voted present on a bill to prevent sex-related shops from opening near schools or houses of worship, which ultimately did not become law, and on a measure to ban a procedure opponents call partial-birth abortion that passed the Senate. He was the lone present vote on bills to protect the privacy of sex-assault victims and to impose tougher requirements on individuals seeking to adopt children.
 
Pam Sutherland, president and chief executive officer of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council, said she asked Obama to vote ""present"" on several bills that proposed narrowing abortion rights – including a package of bills to expand legal protections to infants born alive at any stage of development, including if the birth occurred in the process of an abortion – in order to persuade centrist Democrats and even some moderate Republicans to do the same.
 
""He said, 'You know, I am a no vote on these bills,' and I said, 'You know they respect you and if you vote present, it will be easier for them to vote present,'"" Sutherland said. ""Because people were consistently voting present, the Senate president stopped putting (attack) mailers out to those districts.""
 
The record is clear that Obama did vote ""present"" more than 100 times (we couldn't confirm the 129 figure because records for one session of the state senate during his tenure aren't available electronically). That's out of more than 4,000 votes cast. On many of those votes, Obama was joined by many in his party, making it clear that he was, as he claims, casting votes as part of a broader legislative strategy.
 
But there are several other instances in which he is one of only a few senators to vote ""present,"" and at least eight where he was the only senator to vote ""present."" In those cases, it's hard to see the party's fingerprints on his position, and it's easier to see political expedience. Ultimately, the record is mixed, leaving us little room for more than Half True.

Clinton stands alone on health care mandate
","As the primary race enters its final stretch, the sparring is getting more intense. Sen. Hillary Clinton unveiled an attack ad for the Wisconsin primary in which a narrator chides Sen. Barack Obama for ducking debates.
 
Two more debates are scheduled between the two candidates before March 4, 2008; Clinton wants more, though.
 
""Maybe he'd prefer to give speeches than have to answer questions,"" sniffs an off-screen narrator. ""Like why Hillary Clinton has the only health care plan that covers every American, and the only economic plan that freezes foreclosures.""
 
We'll confine ourselves to examining the health care claim here. Clinton is correct that her plan is the only one among the presidential candidates to require health care coverage for all Americans. John Edwards was another candidate pushing universal coverage, but with his exit from the race on Jan. 30, 2008, Clinton now stands alone.
 
None of the Republicans promote universal health care. Barack Obama has said he wants affordable coverage for everyone, but his plan has no mandate to require coverage.
 
At the most recent Democratic debate on Jan. 31, 2008, Obama said he opposed the mandate for logistical reasons. Enforcing a mandate will require some sort of penalty, such as fines, to ensure compliance, he said. ""And that, I don't think, is helping those without health insurance,"" Obama said.
 
Obama has said he wants to cover every American, but experts say it's unlikely he will without a mandate as part of his plan. Earlier in the campaign, Obama said his plan did provide universal coverage, but we found that claim Barely True; read our ruling

here

.
 
Because Clinton does include a mandate in her plan, she is correct in saying that she is the only candidate for president with a plan that mandates health care for all Americans. We find her statement True.

Both caucus losers, but she's more thorough
","Trying to brush off some of her recent defeats, Sen. Hillary Clinton compared her battle with Sen. Barack Obama to Bill Clinton's presidential travails, noting that he, too, had a tendency to perform lousy in caucuses.
 
""I have something in common with my husband. He never carried caucuses either. He lost all of the ones that I've lost,"" she said in a Feb. 11, 2008, ABC/Politico interview.
 
Misery may love company, but the New York senator is stretching facts a bit to draw comparisons with the self-proclaimed ""Comeback Kid."" That's partly because some states have switched their selection processes between primaries, in which voters cast statewide ballots for the nominee of their choice, and the older caucus system, in which voters meet at the precinct level to decide a winner, sometimes under complicated rules.
 
It's true that Bill Clinton lost all the states that Hillary Clinton has lost among those states that held caucuses in both 1992 and 2008. Those are Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota and Washington. Hillary Clinton also lost primaries in Delaware and Utah — states that in 1992 held caucuses that Bill Clinton lost. And she lost the caucus in Colorado, a state whose primary Bill Clinton couldn't carry 16 years ago. On the other hand, she won the Nevada caucus that her husband lost in 1992.
 
The couple's fortunes also differed in several states that have changed their nominating processes. Hillary Clinton lost caucuses in Kansas, Nebraska and North Dakota, which each held primaries in 1992 that Bill Clinton won. She won the primary in Arizona, a state Bill Clinton was unable to carry when it held a caucus in 1992.
 
As an incumbent president in 1996, Bill Clinton didn't have to sweat intraparty battles and coasted to the party nomination unopposed.
 
It's hard to read too much into comparisons like the one Hillary Clinton cites because the political complexions of some states — particularly in the West — have changed markedly over the past 16 years. So, too, has the nature of campaigning — and the way the 24/7 spin cycle affects groups of voters. Safe to say, both Clintons do better in big states that hold primaries. For this reason, we rule Hillary Clinton's claim Mostly True.
 

UPDATE:

We have updated this item to show that Nevada held a caucus this year, not a primary.

Obama's real competition has been Democrats
","Trying to cast Sen. Barack Obama as untested in general elections, Sen. Hillary Clinton pollster Mark Penn asserted during a Feb. 11 conference call with reporters that the first-term Illinois senator has ""never had a serious Republican challenger.""
 
Critics have frequently tried to hang the ""short on experience"" rap on Obama, but in this instance, Penn is correct.
 
Obama's toughest battles at the state and national level have been in Democratic primaries. As a community organizer and civil rights lawyer on Chicago's South Side, Obama won his first political race in 1996 by successfully challenging the nominating petitions of four primary rivals in the overwhelmingly Democratic 13th Senate district. He faced no Republican opposition.
 
In 2000, Obama made his first run for Congress by challenging incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush in a primary but got trounced, finishing with just 31 percent of the vote, compared to Rush's 61 percent.
 
Four years later, Obama found himself on an unexpectedly easy path to the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Republican Peter G. Fitzgerald. First, Republican multimillionaire front-runner Jack Ryan dropped out of the race amid allegations he pressured his wife to go to sex clubs. The GOP, desparate for a quick replacement, turned to social conservative Alan L. Keyes, who moved from Maryland to Illinois for the race.
 
Obama wound up capturing 70 percent of the vote, buoyed by the national exposure he received from delivering the keynote speech for presidential nominee John Kerry at the Democratic National Convention in Boston.
 
Because Obama has faced only token Republican opposition, when he's faced any at all, we deem this claim to be True.

Clinton distorted Obama's position
","While campaigning for his wife in Maine, a reporter asked former President Bill Clinton about some of the criticism he has received on the trail.
 
Rob Caldwell of the local NBC affliate WCSH-TV in Portland asked Clinton, ""You have been praised for your campaigning for her; you have been criticized for it. Do you have any regrets about the way you have conducted yourself on the campaign trail in the past months? Any regrets about anything you've said or done?""
 
Clinton began by saying, ""Well, everything I have said has been factually accurate. But I think the mistake that I made is to think that I was a spouse like any other spouse who could defend his candidate. I think I can promote Hillary but not defend her because I was president.""
 
He went on to complain that critics have mischaracterized his comments in South Carolina as personal attacks on Sen. Barack Obama.
 
Clinton is wrong when he says everything he said has been factually accurate. We found inaccuracies in his comments about Obama's position on Iraq. Clinton said that Obama claimed the same position on the Iraq war as George W. Bush. But that's a selective quote on comments Obama made about the need to bring a satisfactory conclusion to the Iraq invasion once it had commenced. We rated Clinton's statement Half True; read it

We also found Clinton was flat-out wrong when he slammed Obama for remarks about Ronald Reagan. Clinton criticized Obama for saying ""the Republicans had all the good ideas.""

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'George W. Bush']","
 Bush gets Obama wrong on foreign policy
","In an interview with Chris Wallace on

Fox News Sunday,

President Bush was asked what he thought of Sen. Barack Obama. The president used the question to take a jab at some of Obama's foreign policy positions that are at odds with those of the Bush administration.
 
Here's the full exchange:
 
Wallace: ""Do you think there's a rush to judgment about Barack Obama? Do you think voters know enough about him?""
 
Bush: ""I certainly don't know what he believes in. The only foreign policy thing I remember he said was he's going to attack Pakistan and embrace Ahmadinejad, which — I think I commented that in a press conference when I was asked about it.""
 
Wallace: ""I hope not. But you don't think that we know enough about him or what he stands for?""
 
Bush: ""It doesn't seem like it to me, but in campaigns there's plenty of time for candidates to get defined. He is not yet his party's nominee.""
 
Wallace: ""So why do you think he's gotten this far if people don't know what he stands for?""
 
Bush: ""You're the pundit. I'm just a simple president.""
 
We find that the president is distorting Obama's position.
 
On Aug. 1, 2007, Obama gave a major policy speech on fighting global terrorism at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. He spoke about the problem of terrorists at large within Pakistan. He said he would continue to provide military aid to Pakistan as long as the authorities there work to close terrorist training camps and prevent the Taliban from using Pakistan as a staging area for attacks in Afghanistan.
 
Then Obama added:
""I understand that President Musharraf has his own challenges. But let me make this clear. There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans. They are plotting to strike again. It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al-Qaida leadership meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will.""
 
The speech received significant press coverage. At that time, Republican candidate John McCain criticized Obama for having ""a simplistic view of a very complex situation."" McCain advocated the use of covert action ""before we declare that we're going to bomb the daylights out of them.""
 
We won't take sides here on the advisability of Obama's foreign policy, but it seems some distance from Bush's synopsis that Obama would ""attack Pakistan."" It seems clear that Obama does not advocate attacking the country itself, but rather wants to target terrorists within the country whether he has the permission of the Pakistani government or not.
 
The second part of Bush's statement concerns Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. We couldn't find any statements from Obama praising the Iranian leader. We suspect Bush is remembering a point that Sen. Hillary Clinton attacked Obama on last year.
 
During the CNN/YouTube debate on July 23, 2007, in South Carolina, the Democratic candidates were asked whether, if elected, they would meet ""separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?""
 
Obama said he would. Clinton said she would not, because she didn't want such meetings to be used for propaganda purposes. She later attacked Obama's answer as ""irresponsible and frankly naive."" Obama, however, has stood by his position, saying it represents a dramatic turn away from the Bush administration's minimal diplomatic efforts.
 
""As president of the United States, my job is to look out for the national security interests of this country. Iran, in particular because of the bad decision this administration has made by invading Iraq, is a major player in the Middle East,"" Obama said to reporters in September 2007. ""If it is in the United States' interest to make certain that we can stabilize the situation and avoid further military confrontation and curb state-sponsored terrorism they've been involved with, that's something we should be willing to do.""
 
It's clear that Obama wanted to meet with Ahmadinejad as part of an aggressive effort to engage opponents, not to praise him or ""embrace"" him. Obama called some of Ahmadinejad's comments about Israel and the Holocaust ""hateful lies.""
 
George W. Bush may be president, but he's not a stranger to the bare-knuckled world of politics. In this case, he's taking significant liberties with the position of a candidate who could be his party's opponent for the presidency come fall.
 
Taken individually, Bush's characterization of Obama's remark on Pakistan and his remark on Iran are each inaccurate. Taken together, Bush's statements summarize Obama's foreign policy position — that he would attack an important ally and ""embrace"" an enemy — in a way that just isn't accurate. We rate Bush's statement False.

Cumulatively, major losses
","Raising the prospect that a Hillary Clinton presidency will weaken the Democratic party nationally, a mailer sent on behalf of Barack Obama in the days before Super Tuesday spells out how many governorships and congressional seats the party lost during the eight years of Bill Clinton's presidency.
 
""8 years of the Clintons, major losses for Democrats across the nation,"" the mailer read, comparing the number of Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives after the 1992 and 2000 elections. It shows Democrats lost 12 governorships, seven Senate and 46 House seats over that span.
 
Factually, the mailer's claims are borne out in breakdowns by the Senate, Clerk of the House and Congressional Quarterly, using 1993 and 2001 as the reference years.
 
Many of the Democratic losses came in the 1994 election cycle, when voters dealt a stunning rebuke to Clinton's first-term policies and put Republicans in control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years.
 
But the GOP began to lose congressional seats in the 1996 and 1998 elections, while Clinton still was in office. And just months after he departed, the Senate shifted back to Democratic control after Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords switched his affiliation from Republican to Independent.
 
While it's true that Democrats suffered major losses in 1994, they recouped some of those seats before Clinton left office. We find the claim to be Mostly True.

Clinton's negatives are higher than Obama's
","Sen. Barack Obama often speaks about how he believes he will be a stronger general election candidate than his primary opponent, Sen. Hillary Clinton.
 
At a campaign stop in Alexandria, Va., on Feb. 10, 2008, he brought up the negative opinions some people have of Clinton, who is well known to most voters from her time as first lady.
 
""I think Sen. Clinton starts off with 47 percent of the country against her. That's a hard place to start if you want to win the election,"" he said.
 
Pollsters regularly ask voters whether they rate candidates positively or negatively. Indeed, Clinton's negatives are consistently higher than Obama's, but different polls show her at different levels.
 
We looked at the times the

USA Today

/Gallup Poll asked voters whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Hillary Clinton, going back to January 2007. Her negative percentage fluctuated between 40 and 52, but the average of 21 polls came out to 47.
 
ABC News and the

Washington Post

have asked the question at least four times since January 2007. Her unfavorable ratings on that poll came in between 48 and 40, with an average of 44.5. CNN polled four times and found unfavorables between 39 and 44, with an average of 41.5.
 
Obama's unfavorable ratings tend to be well under 40 percent. In several polls, his unfavorable ratings are in the 20s.
 
Not every poll rates her unfavorables consistently as high as 47 percent, and poll numbers are always a little bit squishy. But, the

USA Today

That's not the actual quote
","Sen. Barack Obama took several swipes at Sen. Hillary Clinton, his rival in the race for the Democratic nomination, at a Feb. 10, 2008, campaign rally in Alexandria, Va.
 
In one, he used an example of something she said to illustrate his point that Americans ""don't want political talk.""
 
""I think part of what the American people are looking for right now is straight talk,"" Obama said. ""They don't want political talk. I'll just give you one example. Sen. Clinton and I were debating and she was asked about the bankruptcy law that she voted for in 2001. . . . During the debate she said, you know, 'I voted for it, but I hoped it wouldn't pass.' That was a quote on live TV. That kind of talk, I think it makes people not trust government.""
 
Problem is, that's not what she said.
 
Obama is referring to a Jan. 15, 2008, Democratic debate in Las Vegas when Clinton was asked by moderator Tim Russert if she regretted her vote in favor of the 2001 bankruptcy bill.
 
Here's what Clinton said: ""Sure I do, but it never became law, as you know. It got tied up. It was a bill that had some things I agreed with and other things I didn't agree with, and I was happy that it never became law. I opposed the 2005 bill as well.""
 
The 2001 bankruptcy bill was intended as a dramatic overhaul of the bankruptcy laws, making it harder for people to eliminate debts in bankruptcy court and keeping wealthy debtors from using their homes as a shield for assets. It was hugely backed by the banking, credit card and retail credit industries. It passed the Senate, 83-15, on March 15, 2001, with the yes vote of Clinton, but because of differences in the House legislation, it never became law.
 
Four years later, bankruptcy reform finally did become law. Clinton missed that vote; Obama opposed it.
 
But back to the 2001 bill. Clinton said she was ""happy that it never became law."" He says she said, "" 'I voted for it, but I hoped it wouldn't pass.' "" The thing is, being happy about something after it happens is not the same as hoping along the way that it wouldn't happen. And yet, the latter is how Obama characterizes Clinton's words.
 
We need to be clear on this point, given that Obama sets up his charge against Clinton as an example of ""political talk"" and follows it up with, ""That kind of talk, I think it makes people not trust government.""
 
Absolutely, Clinton said she regretted her vote. And, had Obama phrased his charge differently, he would have a case here. But because he portrays her wording as a precise quote, and is so incorrect about it, we give him a False.

for a similar statement, but we thought we should take another look.
 
A check of the latest numbers finds he is still wrong.
 
The Feb. 4 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration found the average price of gasoline was $2.98 a gallon, down 23 cents from the peak of $3.22 last May 21.
 
In fact, while the senator was in Alexandria, his motorcade drivers could have filled up for $2.92 a gallon at Barber's Auto Service Center, an Exxon station near the school.
 
We might have been inclined to cut Obama some slack for speaking in general terms about the price of gas, but he is still wrong when you look at historical levels. If you adjust for inflation, the current national price is still 41 cents below the peak of $3.39 per gallon, set in March 1981.
 
And so, we find his statement False.

Polls show Obama beating McCain
","Sen. Barack Obama regularly makes the argument that he will be a stronger general election candidate than his primary opponent, Sen. Hillary Clinton.
 
In a speech at a campaign rally on Feb. 10, 2008, he continued to expound on that theme, this time citing poll numbers.
 
""The last six polls, including this week's

Time

magazine, show that I beat John McCain by six or seven points,"" Obama declared at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Va.
 
At the time of of his speech, several polls indeed showed Obama beating McCain by a six-point or more margin. The

Time

magazine poll showed him beating McCain by seven points, 48 to 41. An Associated Press/Ipsos showed him winning by six points, 48 to 42. A CNN poll showed him winning by eight points, 52 to 44.
 
But those are three polls, not six. (For a neat summary of recent Obama-McCain polling, check out this

link

from RealClearPolitics.com; we accessed it on Feb. 11, 2008.) We weren't able to find three other recent polls showing similar results.
 
It's possible that Obama has access to private polls we haven't seen. We asked the campaign for a response but didn't hear back.
 
So we will deduct a small amount on the Truth-O-Meter for his citing of ""the last six polls,"" but Obama's larger point is correct. Polls show he is winning against McCain, while Clinton either loses to McCain or beats him by a smaller margin. So we award this statement a Mostly True.

A new twist on an old distortion
","A new chain e-mail against Barack Obama recycles some false charges and adds some false twists.
 
The e-mail, forwarded to us by several readers, provides a new spin on the false claim that Obama refused to put his hand over his heart during the Pledge of Allegiance.
 
""Barack Hussein Obama will NOT recite the Pledge of Allegience nor will he show any reverence for our flag,"" it says. ""While others place their hands over their hearts, Obama turns his back to the flag and slouches.""
 
We have previously examined e-mail allegations that he attended a radical Muslim school

(so inaccurate we called it Pants on Fire),

that he took the oath of office with a Koran (also

Pants on Fire)

and that his middle name is Mohammed

(Pants on Fire).

We've also explored the questions surrounding

this photograph

from

Time

magazine's Web site, which prompted the allegations that he ""refused to say the pledge""

(also False).

 
Now comes a new allegation, apparently relying on the same photo. Since this one is new to many readers, we'll revisit some of our previous findings and address the new charge about slouching. (This is the first time we can recall slouching being used as the basis for a political attack.)
 
The Obama photo was taken Sept. 16, 2007, in Indianola, Iowa, at the Harkin Steak Fry, an annual political event hosted by U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin. The caption on the

Time

photo says Obama and the others ""stand during the national anthem.""
 
Obama was on stage with New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, Sen. Hillary Clinton and Harkin's wife Ruth.
 
As the

Time

caption indicates, the photo was taken during the national anthem, not the pledge, so the photo does not support the allegation that Obama ""turns his back and . . . slouches"" during the pledge. This is corroborated by

an ABC News video

of the occasion.
 
It's clear from the video that the assembled Democrats are not turning their backs on the flag to make an antipatriotic statement. They are looking at the same point — presumably the woman singing the anthem.
 
It is a matter of interpretation whether Obama is slouching as the anthem is played. The photo shows him with his hands clasped in front of his waist while the others have their hands over the heart (a point of anthem protocol that we addressed in

this item).

But it doesn't look to us like he's slouching and there's no evidence to suggest his posture was making an antipatriotic statement.
 
Obama has responded to these allegations by saying he often leads the pledge when he presides over the Senate, as seen in

this video from the Senate.

 
So once again, we find a chain e-mail is incorrect about Obama. We find the statement False.

"['National', 'Elections', 'Mike Huckabee']","
Unions gave Huck their GOP nod
","It's not often that we hear a Republican presidential candidate crowing about support from unions.
 
""I'm the only Republican who has gotten endorsements in this presidential race from major labor unions, the international painters union as well as the machinists and aerospace workers — first time in over 100 years from either union,"" Huckabee said in a TV interview the day after Super Tuesday.
 
Huckabee is correct on a few points here.
 
Unions don't usually endorse Republican candidates, and they support Democratic candidates with contributions by margins of roughly 9 to 1, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
 
But this year, two unions decided to endorse candidates in the primaries for both parties: The International Union of Painters and Allied Trades with 160,000 members, and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers with 720,000 members.
 
In the Democratic race, both unions endorsed Sen. Hillary Clinton, and in the Republican race, both endorsed Mike Huckabee.
 
We called both unions and they confirmed the ""100 years"" statement because it's the first time they've endorsed Republican candidates since they formed more than 100 years ago.
 
James Williams, head of the International Painters, said the union decided to endorse Republicans this year as a way of reflecting the sentiments of their Republican members, who make up about 30 percent of the union. The painters mailed out a ballot to more than 160,000 members and asked them to vote in each race and Huckabee was the GOP choice.
 
Add to that the fact that some members live in heavily Republican areas and are represented by Republican elected officials, he said. The endorsement is a way of reaching out beyond the unions' usual Democratic allies.
 
""The reality is that we have to work across the aisle with both Democrats and Republicans,"" Williams said. ""It hasn't been done in the last seven years. But hopefully whoever is elected next will realize we can't have this polarization.""
 
Huckabee may have won the endorsements because he actively campaigned for them. He was the only Republican to attend the national convention of the machinists' union in August 2007.
 
He also speaks regularly on the need for fair trade agreements and the problems of working men and women. Critics and supporters alike have described him as an ""economic populist.""
 
Not that Huckabee's union record is flawless: Unions have criticized him for crossing picket lines of the Writers Guild of America to appear on late-night television shows, among other things.
 
We searched for major union endorsements of any other Republican candidates and were unable to find one. A spokesperson with the AFL-CIO said the Huckabee endorsements were the only ones they knew of.
 
There are a lot of unusual things about Huckabee, a bass guitar-playing, Chuck Norris-approved preacher. Add Republican and union-endorsed to that list. We find his statement True.

It tasted like chicken
","
In two recent appearances on MSNBC's

Morning Joe

, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee boasted about frying squirrels in a popcorn popper.
 
""When I was in college, we used to take a popcorn popper – because that was the only thing they would let us use in the dorms – and we would fry squirrel,"" he said on Jan. 18, 2008.
 
When he appeared on the show three weeks later, on Feb. 6, co-host Mika Brzezinski asked him if he would come back and demonstrate his cooking techniques.
 
""I'm really ready to do that,"" Huckabee said. ""Because I think the country needs to be able to somehow get into those kind of culinary delights that they've been missing for a long time.""
 
Forgive us, but we were skeptical.
 
We wondered if the former governor was truly an aficionado of cooked rodents, or if he was just making a play for the all-important squirrel-eating Republican voting bloc.
 
So we tracked down Huckabee's roommate from Ouachita Baptist University, Rick Caldwell, to ask if the governor really had eaten squirrel.
 
""I was there,"" Caldwell said, quickly adding that ""I was not a co-conspirator to the actual frying of the squirrel. But I admit to partaking.""
 
Indeed, they had a popcorn popper in their room in the Daniel North dormitory in 1973 and Huckabee was quite the enterprising chef, said Caldwell, a longtime friend who is now an adviser to his presidential campaign.
 
Huckabee devised a way to make faux doughnuts by punching holes in the middle of biscuits and then frying them in the popcorn popper. Once they were cooked, Huckabee and Caldwell would roll them in sugar. Caldwell says it was as good as a Krispy Kreme.
 
The squirrel fry was a one-time thing, Caldwell said. A student living down the hall admired the popcorn popper and suggested it would be good for frying a squirrel. Caldwell was out of the room when they cooked it, but he got to sample the meat when he returned.
 
""It tasted like chicken,"" Caldwell said.
 
No one on the PolitiFact staff had sampled a squirrel, so we turned to ""Bayou Bill"" Scifres, a retired outdoors writer from the

Indianapolis Star

who runs

All Outdoors,

a Web site that offers advice on cooking wild game.
 
Bayou Bill loves a qood squirrel.
 
""There are so many ways to cook 'em!"" he told us. ""With hot biscuits and gravy and fried squirrel and corn on the cob – it's like dying and going to heaven!""
 
He said cooking them is easy:
 
""Fry them to a beautiful golden brown on all sides and then turn the heat down; cover the skillet and put in water or maybe good cooking wine. You just let them steam in that for 15 minutes or half an hour,"" he said
 
We found recipes on other Web sites that also looked promising:

squirrel cacciatore,


squirrel croquettes

and

squirrels in cream sauce.

 
Yum!

One man found his winning message
","In advance of the Potomac Primary on Feb. 12, 2008, Republican front-runner John McCain released a TV ad in Virginia, the District of Columbia and Maryland that has played to other markets in this primary process.
 
""Never Surrender"" is a 30-second spot that shows images of Sen. McCain as a prisoner of war, walking alongside Ronald Reagan and on the campaign trail. Its claims are well supported.
 
•

""One man sacrificed for his country.""

 
McCain served 22 years in the U.S. Navy, including five as a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down in Vietnam. He has been honored with the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Legion of Merit, Purple Heart and the Distinguished Flying Cross.
 
Of his remaining Republican contenders, only Rep. Ron Paul has military experience. He served as a medical doctor in the U.S. Air Force from 1963 to 1965 in San Antonio, Texas, and in the U.S. Air National Guard from 1965 to 1968. He did not go to war as McCain did. That appears to be the distinction drawn here. (

Read our fact sheet on ""Who was in the military?""


here.

)
 
•

""One man opposed a flawed strategy in Iraq. One man had the courage to call for change. One man didn't play politics with the truth.""

 
Although he has been one of the Senate's strongest and most vocal advocates of the war in Iraq, leading recent debates against Democratic bills to set a timetable for withdrawal, McCain has also been one of the Bush adminstration's biggest Republican critics.
 
As far back as mid 2003, shortly after the invasion of Iraq, McCain was warning that the United States needed to send more troops to Iraq and more money to Iraq reconstruction efforts, or else face a deep and long-lasting insurgency that would threaten America's mission there.
 
Which, of course, is exactly what has happened. He was also a strident critic of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, telling interviewers that he lacked confidence in Rumsfeld as far back as 2004 — meaty criticism for a top Republican on the Armed Services Committee.
 
""There's not enough (troops), and we are in a very serious situation, in my view, a race against time. We need to spend a whole lot more money to get the services back to the people. We need to get the electricity going, the fuel, the water. And unless we get that done and get it done pretty soon, we could face a very serious situation,"" McCain told NBC's

Meet the Press

on Aug. 24, 2003.
 
""Time is not on our side. People in 125-degree heat with no electricity and no fuel are going to become angry in a big hurry. The sophistication of the attacks on U.S. and allied troops have increased. And what we do in the next several months will determine whether we're in a very difficult situation or not, and there's still time, but we've got to act quickly.""
 
As for his claim that just ""one man"" opposed the strategy in Iraq, that's a bit of a stretch: Independent experts and many congressional Democrats have lavished criticism on the administration's strategy in Iraq.
 
But among his Republican competitors for the presidential nomination, McCain is right. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has suggested that he, too, would take a different route in Iraq than the president, but McCain was clearly there first.
 
•

""One man stands up to the special interests.""

 
This is a reference to McCain's strong opposition to what he calls wasteful pork barrel spending and earmark projects. Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington-based group that watches for such things, says McCain holds the title of pork-fighter and has honored him with its ""Treasury Guardians"" award.
 
Overall, it's an effective TV ad with accurate claims. We give it a True.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama voted consistently for abortion rights
","The Clinton campaign has raised doubts about Sen. Barack Obama's record on abortion rights because he voted ""present"" rather than ""no"" on seven antiabortion bills when he was in the Illinois state Senate.
 
The day before the Super Tuesday primaries, an e-mail from the head of the Connecticut National Organization for Women took issue with those votes, prompting a response from U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, an Obama supporter, who said the effort by NOW was divisive.
 
""The facts are clear – in the Illinois state Senate, choice advocates asked strong prochoice legislators like Senator Obama to vote 'present' on Republican-designed bills like a ban on partial-birth abortion to protect a woman's right to chose,"" DeLauro wrote. ""Senator Obama has always had a 100 percent prochoice rating.""
 
We're addressing the votes with

this item

and

this article,

so here we'll focus on Obama's record.
 
Indeed, DeLauro is correct. Obama has 100 percent congressional voting ratings from NARAL Prochoice America for his three years in the U.S. Senate. The Planned Parenthood Action Fund similarly gave Obama a perfect score on its 2006 congressional scorecard.
 
He also earned 100 percent records for his votes in eight years as a state senator, according to Pam Sutherland, president and CEO of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council. (She is neutral in the presidential race and her group has not endorsed a candidate.)
 
""He has always voted in favor of abortion rights,"" she said.
 
So we find DeLauro's statement to be True.
 
",[<zip object at 0x000002809C156940>],/factchecks/2008/feb/06/barack-obama/obama-voted-consistently-for-abortion-rights/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'Hillary Clinton']","
He voted ""present,"" which is similar to ""no""
","
As the Democratic race has tightened, the Hillary Clinton campaign has portrayed Sen. Barack Obama as inconsistent on abortion rights.
 
""In the Illinois state Senate, on issue after issue, my opponent voted 'present,' instead of yes or no. Seven of those votes were on a women's right to choose,"" Sen. Clinton said in a December 2007 speech in Iowa. In the days leading up to Super Tuesday on Feb. 5, 2008, several other groups repeated the charge against Obama via e-mails.
 
The facts here are not in dispute. Obama did vote present on seven bills that attempted to restrict abortion. His defenders argue that it was a tactic to disrupt legislation that would be used against Democrats in swing districts.
 
It's worth pausing here to explain what the ""present"" vote means. The Illinois Legislature allows members to vote ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""present."" Bills need ""yes"" votes to pass, so a vote of ""present"" counts the same as a ""no."" Thus, Obama's ""present"" votes on bills seeking to restrict abortion counted the same as if he had voted ""no."" All of the bills passed by in the Senate by sizable margins.
 
The seven votes were on proposals that abortion opponents have successfully passed in other places. Two bills outlawed the late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. Two bills required parental notification for minors seeking abortions. Three bills were for so-called ""born alive"" legislation, which require doctors to administer medical care to aborted fetuses that survive the abortion process in hopes that the fetuses can survive.
 
No one questions that Obama opposed the seven pieces of legislation; indeed, he is mentioned in news reports from the time as being against several of the measures. Rather, Obama's critics say he ducked a ""no"" vote; supporters say it was a tactical move.
 
Those interpretations seem to have split the leaders of the Illinois abortion rights movement.
 
Obama should have voted ""no"" on those bills, said Bonnie Grabenhofer, president of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization for Women, which has endorsed Clinton.
 
""We think the way you talk about a bill and the way you stand up is important,"" she said. ""It was a strategy that allowed people to take political cover as opposed to talking about why the bill was a bad bill and clearly saying no.""
 
But Pam Sutherland, president and CEO of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council, said Obama was helping advance a prochoice agenda by voting present.
 
""He always was going to vote 'no' on these bills. We needed to keep some of our moderate Democrats from voting yes, which is something you never want to happen,"" Sutherland said. By having a well-known supporter of abortion rights also vote present, it gave other Democrats cover, she said.
 
Regardless of the interpretation of the ""present"" votes, Obama has received extremely positive ratings from organizations that promote abortion rights. Even Grabenhofer's organization, the NOW Illinois political action committee, endorsed Obama twice after the ""present"" votes. The group did not endorse in the U.S. Senate race in 2004, she said, in part because of the present votes.
 
Steve Trombley of Planned Parenthood in Chicago has defended Obama's prochoice bona fides, even though Planned Parenthood has not endorsed in the race.
 
""Barack Obama has always been committed to a woman's right to choose. He has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record both in the U.S. Senate and the Illinois Senate,"" Trombley wrote in a statement posted on the Obama campaign Web site.
 
""I don't know why Illinois NOW has changed its opinion of Barack Obama since his record has remained the same and since his time as a state senator, he has only demonstrated a full and steady commitment to choice,"" Trombley added.
 
Both Clinton and Obama have their supporters among the abortion rights movement.
 
Clinton arguably has the bigger endorsements. She has been endorsed by the National Organization for Women and EMILY's List, an organization dedicated to electing prochoice women.
 
Obama has some high-profile endorsements as well, such as Kate Michelman, former president, NARAL Prochoice America, who sided with Obama after John Edwards dropped out of the race. Obama also has the support of U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the first executive director of EMILY's List, who has publicly defended Obama as a strong supporter of abortion rights. We checked her statement

here

and found it to be True.
 
Two other large groups, NARAL Prochoice America and Planned Parenthood, are not endorsing. Planned Parenthood, however, has given both candidates 100 percent ratings for their records on abortion.
 
We stipulate that there are clearly different interpretations of the significance of Obama's ""present"" votes. But there's no doubt he made them. So we find Clinton's statement to be True.

Actually, not so very large
","In a

Face the Nation

interview on Feb. 3, 2008, host Bob Schieffer asked Sen. John McCain if he could win the general election if conservatives decide to sit it out.
 
""Oh, I would doubt that,"" McCain responded. ""But I am confident we are already seeing many of the conservatives, and in the state of Florida, we carried Florida in a Republican-only primary. We got a very large percentage of the, quote, conservative vote.""
 
Exit poll results from Florida show McCain is on shaky ground here.
 
Among self-described ""conservative"" Republican voters, 29 percent voted for McCain, according to a CNN exit poll. That's hardly a huge number. In fact, it's less than the 37 percent of conservatives who voted for Mitt Romney.
 
""He didn't even get a plurality,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, who edits the independent Rothenberg Political Report in Washington, D.C. ""I don't consider that a large percentage. They (conservatives) haven't warmed to him entirely.""
 
What's more, the more conservative the voter, the less likely the vote for McCain. Among Republicans who described themselves as ""somewhat conservative,"" 35 percent voted for McCain, better than Romney's 32 percent. But among ""very conservative"" voters, McCain won just 21 percent. Romney more than doubled his tally with 44 percent, and Mike Huckabee nearly tied McCain in this category with 20 percent.
 
We might be inclined to give McCain more leeway on his claim to a ""very large percentage"" of conservative voters in Florida if it had significantly improved from earlier primaries. But it hasn't.
 
Among self-described conservative voters in the New Hampshire Republican primary, McCain got 30 percent of the vote; compared to 38 percent for Romney. About the same as in Florida.
 
In South Carolina, where 69 percent of those who participated in the Republican primary consider themselves ""conservative,"" McCain got 26 percent of the vote, compared to 35 percent for Huckabee and 16 percent for Romney.
 
""I don't see him gaining,"" Rothenberg said. ""He still hasn't demonstrated that he can coalesce the conservative vote.""
 
Now, at the end of the day, Rothenberg said, if McCain is running against Sen. Hillary Clinton or Sen. Barack Obama, the conservative voters likely will back him.
 
But as for McCain's characterization that conservative support in Florida was ""very large,"" it's too relative a concept to call it False. But when it's less than half, less than your opponent and when it hasn't even gone up, we can say it's Barely True.

50,000 started war without body armor

","In the Democratic debate in Los Angeles on Jan. 31, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton criticized the Bush administration for failing to give American soldiers in Iraq the resources they require. She leveled this accusation:
 
""We had to fight to get body armor. You know, George Bush sent people to war without body armor.""
The issue of body armor — who gets it and whether it's the right kind — has been a source of intense scrutiny nearly from the start of the war in Iraq.
 
A March 7, 2005, story in the

New York Times

by reporter Michael Moss detailed a deadly miscalculation by the military near the start of the war in April 2003. Army Gen. Richard A. Cody decided to stop buying bulletproof vests after a determination that some 50,000 soldiers not on the front lines could do without them. In the following weeks, Moss wrote, ""Iraqi snipers and suicide bombers stepped up deadly attacks, often directed at those very soldiers behind the front lines."" Cody quickly ordered bulletproof vests for every soldier. But it took 167 days to start getting those vests to soldiers due to production and paperwork delays. Some soldiers waited months more.
 
Many soldiers heading to Iraq bought their own body armor despite assurances from the military that it would be provided.
 
In April 2005, the Government Accountability Office reported on shortages of critical force protection items, including individual body armor. The problems were caused, the report concluded, due to materials shortages, production limitations and distribution problems.
 
But by and large, everyone eventually got body armor.
 
In ensuing years, the issue became whether the military was using the right kind.
 
In January 2006, the

New York Times

cited a secret Pentagon study that found that as many as 80 percent of the Marines killed in Iraq from wounds to the upper body could have survived if they had body armor that reached a soldier's shoulders, sides and torso.
 
In March 2007, Clinton and fellow Democratic Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia sent a letter to the Comptroller of the United States, calling on him to initiate a GAO investigation to reassess the body armor systems used by the military.
 
The following month, the GAO issued a report, which concluded that ""Army and Marine Corps body armor is currently meeting theater ballistic requirements and the required amount needed for personnel in theater, including the amounts needed for the surge of troops in Iraq.""
 
Nevertheless, with emerging technology and debate over the best type of body armor, the GAO is reassessing body armor, said Roger Charles, vice chairman of the nonpartisan Soldiers for the Truth Foundation, which has been at the forefront of the body armor debate.
 
Clinton's comment about troops heading into war without body armor, while it wasn't true for all, was true for some soldiers at the beginning of the war. So we rate Clinton's comment Mostly True.

McCain voted against cuts, now supports them
","The advocacy group Citizens United Political Victory Fund launched an ad that at first appears to be an attack on Sen. Hillary Clinton, making several charges about votes and political positions.
 
""One candidate voted against the Bush tax cuts, both times,"" the narrator states, among other charges.
 
A photo of Clinton slides over to reveal Sen. John McCain; the narrator says, ""Hillary Clinton? No. John McCain.""
 
""John McCain. Surprisingly liberal,"" the ad concludes.
 
The ad is correct that McCain voted against tax cuts proposed by the Bush administration two times, in 2001 and 2003. McCain was on the losing end of those votes; the tax cuts passed. In 2006, McCain changed position and voted in favor of extending the tax cuts. McCain has explained his position by saying that although he opposed the cuts when first proposed because of budget issues, rescinding the tax cuts after they were in effect would be the equivalent of a tax increase.
 
The ad gets it right that McCain voted against the tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. But by using the word ""both,"" it implies there were only two votes. It doesn't mention the 2006 vote when McCain changed position and voted in favor of a tax cut extension. (Clinton voted in favor of the 2006 tax cuts as well.)
 
We have to deduct a little bit for leaving the impression that there were only two votes on the tax cuts, but the ad is correct that McCain voted against the measures. So we find the statement that McCain voted against the Bush tax cuts ""both times"" to be Mostly True.

Clinton brought home even more bacon
","With polls showing he has a solid lead in most Super Tuesday states, Sen. John McCain took aim at Sen. Hillary Clinton while campaigning in Fairfield, Conn., on Feb. 3, 2008.
 
McCain boasted that he never sought special projects for his state, while Clinton had sought too many.
 
""In her short time in the United States Senate, the senator from New York, Senator Clinton, got $500-million worth of pork barrel projects. My friends, that kind of thing is going to stop,"" McCain said.
 
We have previously found exceptions in McCain's claims about his own pork (we gave him a False in

this item),

but he's right that Clinton brought lots of federal money to New York. It's just that he dramatically understates how much pork she got.
 
After she was elected in 2000, Clinton spent her first term focusing heavily on parochial issues. Often joining forces with the senior senator from New York, fellow Democrat Charles Schumer, Clinton issued a blizzard of news releases touting federal money such as $250,000 for ""artspace"" projects in Buffalo, $200,000 for the Mid-Hudson Children's Museum, $200,00 for the YWCA of Niagara and $69,036 for the golden nematode project at Cornell University (yeah, we had to look it up: the golden nematode is a pest that harms potatoes).
 
The McCain campaign says it got the $500-million figure from two news stories — a

Los Angeles Times,

report from December 2007 that said ""since taking office in 2001, Clinton has delivered $500-million worth of earmarks that have specifically benefited 59 corporations,"" and a report in

, a Washington, D.C., political newspaper that said Clinton obtained at least $530-million in federal money from the first three of the 13 appropriations bills approved in 2007.
 
But those reflect just a portion of Clinton's prolific pork production.
 
Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that tracks congressional spending, has identified about $2.2-billion in Clinton projects in her seven years in the Senate. The group won't publish its final database for several weeks, but Keith Ashdown, an investigator for the group, said a preliminary analysis showed Clinton has brought home far more in federal money than the other senators in the presidential race, McCain and Barack Obama.
 
Ashdown likened Clinton to Al D'Amato, the famous pothole politician who represented New York from 1981 to 1999. ""She has used the power of the purse to take care of a lot of areas of New York,"" Ashdown said.
 
So McCain is right that Clinton has brought truckloads of bacon to her New York constituents. McCain just dramatically understates the amount. (McCain's campaign said he was simply being ""conservative"" with his claim.)
 
For our ruling, we find that while McCain's numbers are low, he's actually more correct than he realizes because she's brought so much pork to New York. We rate his attack Mostly True.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Mitt Romney']","
McCain said it
","Mitt Romney touts his business and executive experience as evidence he would deftly steer the economy as president. At the same time, he blasts rival John McCain as lacking when it comes to the economy.
 
""He has a number of things that are great strengths of his, but he happened to say the economy was not his strong suit,"" Romney said at a campaign stop in Denver. ""Well, at a time like this in a country like this, I think it is important to have a president for whom the economy is his strong suit.""
 
Did Sen. McCain say that? He denied it at a Republican debate in Boca Raton, Fla., when journalist Tim Russert questioned him about it.
 
Tim Russert: ""Senator McCain, you have said repeatedly, 'I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues. I still need to be educated.' Is it a problem for your campaign that the economy is now the most important issue, one that, by your own acknowledgement, you're not well versed on?""
 
McCain: ""Actually, I don't know where you got that quote from. I'm very well versed in economics.""
 
It seems that Romney and Russert are both right on this point, while McCain is contradicting his previous statements.
 
McCain gave an interview to the

Wall Street Journal

in 2005 in which he said, ""I'm going to be honest: I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues. I still need to be educated.""
 
He told the

Boston Globe

in December 2007, """"The issue of economics is not something I've understood as well as I should.""
 
Russert followed up a few days later in a one-on-one interview with McCain. McCain acknowledged the quotes and gave the following response:
 
McCain: ""Okay. Let me tell you what I was trying to say and what I meant in that soundpiece. I spent 22 years in the military. I spent 20 years in the Senate Armed Services Committee. I've been involved in national security issues all my life. I attended the National War College. Of course I know more about national security than any other issue. That's been my entire life. Am I smart on economics? Yes. I was chairman of the Commerce Committee. That's why people like Phil Gramm, Tom Coburn and Warren Rudman and Carly Fiorina and the real strong economic minds, Jack Kemp, the real strong minds on the economy and conservatives on the economy are supporting me. Of course, I always have things to learn, and I continue to learn every day. But I'm very strong on the economy, and, frankly, my economic record is a lot stronger than that of the governor of Massachusetts when you look at his record as governor.""
 
McCain's explanation doesn't change the fact that he did say that economics was not his strong suit. In this instance, Romney is accurately quoting McCain's past remarks, so we find Romney's statement True.

"['National', 'Elections', 'Citizens United Political Victory Fund']","
That's the ticket
","Republicans have often questioned Sen. John McCain's conservative stripes, and the idea that he was a potential running mate for Democrat John Kerry in 2004 stokes their suspicions even more.
 
The advocacy group Citizens United Political Victory Fund is currently on the attack, launching an ad that at first appears to be aimed at Hillary Clinton.
 
""One candidate voted against the Bush tax cuts, both times. ... And was even mentioned as a running mate with John Kerry.""
 
A photo of Clinton slides over to reveal McCain; the narrator says, ""Hillary Clinton? No. John McCain.""
 
We checked the claim on McCain's votes

here.

 
As for the charge that McCain was mentioned as a running mate with Democratic nominee John Kerry in 2004? That's true.
 
There are many, many references in the media to the idea that McCain was possible for the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket. Here are just a few:
 
• In March 2004, reports about the offer prompted

Good Morning America

host Charles Gibson to ask McCain about it in an interview on the show. McCain answered: ""John Kerry is a very close friend of mine. We've been friends for years. Obviously, I would entertain it. But there's, I see no scenario, no scenario, no scenario where I, I foresee no scenario where that would happen.""
 
• After Kerry picked John Edwards as his running mate in July 2004, the

Washington Post

reported that Kerry initiated phone calls to McCain about a possible crossover ticket, ""but McCain made clear he was not interested.""
 
• A February 2007 article in

Vanity Fair

magazine titled ""Prisoner of Conscience"" says: ""Kerry felt close enough to McCain at the time to make multiple and serious inquiries about McCain's interest in running for vice president on a national-unity ticket (and McCain basked in the courtship, even if he knew nothing could ever come of it).
 
• And, in an April 2007 interview with the Web site myDD.com (Direct Democracy for People-Powered Politics), Kerry says McCain's people approached him about being on the Democratic ticket. Responding to suggestions that McCain had approached prominent Democrats about switching parties, Kerry says: ""It doesn't surprise me completely because his people similarly approached me to engage in a discussion about his potentially being on the ticket as vice president. So his people were active — let's put it that way.""
 
We're not saying McCain gave the idea much thought or even that he was offered the job, but it's clear he ""was mentioned as a running mate with John Kerry."" We rule this statement True.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Barack Obama']","
Clinton endorses diplomacy
","Barack Obama made his most direct case for the Democratic nomination at a speech on Jan. 30, 2008, in Denver. He criticized fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton, arguing that he represents a more dramatic distinction with John McCain, the apparent Republican front-runner after winning Florida's primary.
 
In making his argument, Obama attacked Clinton for voting with Republicans on national security issues, among other things.
 
Among Obama's points: ""It's time for new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with John McCain is not by nominating someone who ... agrees with him in embracing the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like.""
 
On this point, Obama seems to be drawing on a difference that arose between him and Clinton in a July 2007 debate hosted by CNN and YouTube.
 
A YouTube questioner asked if the candidates would be ""willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries.""
 
Obama said he would; Clinton said she wouldn't.
 
Clinton explained her reasoning: ""I will promise a very vigorous diplomatic effort because I think it is not that you promise a meeting at that high a level before you know what the intentions are. I don't want to be used for propaganda purposes. I don't want to make a situation even worse. But I certainly agree that we need to get back to diplomacy, which has been turned into a bad word by this administration.""
 
John McCain's public comments seem to reflect an openness to diplomacy while also putting restrictions on face-to-face meetings.
 
""The most overrated aspect of our dialogue about international relations is direct face-to-face talks,"" he said in December 2007. ""BlackBerrys work. Emissaries work. There's many thousands of ways to communicate. The question is, are you going to have direct talks, and does that enhance the prestige of the president of Iran?""
 
It's not unreasonable to say that Clinton and McCain share a skepticism about having the president conduct face-to-face diplomatic meetings directly. But Obama strays badly in taking that shared view and equating it with what he calls ""the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like."" Clinton, who was asked about it directly, clearly says she would approach diplomacy differently than the Bush administration has. We find Obama's claim Barely True.

"['National', 'Terrorism', 'Barack Obama']","
Clinton changed on torture
","Barack Obama made his most direct case for the Democratic nomination at a speech on Jan. 30, 2008, in Denver. He criticized fellow Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's candidacy, arguing that he represents a more dramatic distinction with John McCain, the apparent Republican frontrunner after winning Florida's primary.
 
In making his argument, Obama attacked Clinton for voting with Republicans on national security issues, among other things.
 
After naming a number of areas where he said Clinton and McCain had the same positions, Obama attacked Clinton for diverging from McCain on the issue of torture. Clinton ""actually differed with him by arguing for exceptions for torture before changing positions when the politics of the moment changed,"" Obama said.
 
It sounds a little convoluted, so here's the step-by-step.
 
In October 2006, Clinton spoke about exceptions to a no-torture policy when speaking to the

New York Daily News.

Clinton mentioned a ""ticking time bomb"" scenario in which a captured terrorist has knowledge of an imminent terror attack and interrogators want to use torture.
 
""In the event we were ever confronted with having to interrogate a detainee with knowledge of an imminent threat to millions of Americans, then the decision to depart from standard international practices must be made by the president, and the president must be held accountable,"" she said.
""That very, very narrow exception within very, very limited circumstances is better than blasting a big hole in our entire law.""
 
Then, on Sept. 26, 2007, Clinton said something different. During a debate, Tim Russert asked her about the ticking bomb scenario and here's what she said: ""As a matter of policy, it cannot be American policy, period."" She said she met with military generals who told her there is ""very little evidence that it works.""
 
In the days after the debate, the Republican National Committee criticized her for flip-flopping, and Obama said he would oppose torture ""without exception or equivocation,"" according to

Daily News

reports.
 
Did Clinton change position because of her talks with the generals or because of the ""politics of the moment""? We can't see inside Clinton's head, so our ruling doesn't reflect on that part of the statement. But it is clear she changed her mind about the ""ticking bomb"" scenario. So we rate Obama's claim True.

Obama is referring to the 2002 vote authorizing the use of force in Iraq, widely considered to have given President Bush the authority for the invasion. Clinton voted for the measure, as did McCain. Obama was not in the U.S. Senate at that time, though he did give a speech opposing the war while an Illinois state senator.
 
Obama is right: Clinton and McCain were on the same side in voting for the use of force in Iraq. We find this claim to be True.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'John McCain']","
One man's fees are another's taxes
","Not willing to concede the True Tax Conservative mantle to Mitt Romney, John McCain reiterated in a Jan. 30, 2008, debate a claim he has made frequently about Romney's tax record as governor of Massachusetts.
 
""His (Romney's) record was that he raised taxes by $730-million,"" McCain said.
 
Bill Clinton once famously said, ""It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is."" Here, it depends upon what the meaning of ""taxes"" is.
 
Romney says he never raised taxes. And in fact, he never raised the state income tax or sales tax rates as governor of Massachusetts. We addressed a related claim by Romney in a TV ad

here.

 
But he did raise ""fees."" And he did make changes to tax codes to close ""loopholes"" that resulted in some businesses having to pay more taxes.
 
Here was Romney's take on McCain's charge during the Republican debate:
 
""Now, why did we raise fees $240-million? We had a $3-billion budget shortfall, we decided we were not going to raise taxes, and we found that some fees hadn't been raised in as many as 20 years. These were not broad-based fees for things like getting your driver's license or your license plate for your car, but instead something like the cost of a sign on the interstate and how much it was going to cost to publish a McDonald's or a Burger King sign on the interstate. We went from, like, $200 a sign to $2,000 a sign to raise money for our state in a way that was consistent with the what the market had done over the ensuing years.""
 
Romney also raised fees for getting married, buying a house, bringing a case to court and using a public golf course.
 
The amount raised by the increased fees is a matter of some dispute. Romney said during the debate that they came to just $240-million (previously, Romney has said the fees came to $260-million. It's unclear if he simply misspoke.). In a lengthy analysis of Romney's gubernatorial record, the

Boston Globe

said the $260-million, raised in 2004, ignores at least $71-million in new fees implemented shortly after Romney took office. In a 2006 fiscal policy report card on America's governors, the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, estimated the cost of the fees at $500-million and gave Romney a C.
 
So when is a fee actually a tax? According to some tax groups, it's when the cost of a fee exceeds the cost of services rendered.
 
Romney noted that the impetus for increasing fees was to pay down some of the massive debt he inherited as governor. So presumably some of the increased fees were used to subsidize unrelated parts of the budget. But other fees were simply antiquated.
 
Said McCain: ""He called them 'fees.' I'm sure the people that had to pay it, whether they called them bananas, they still had to pay $730-million extra.""
 
While McCain's campaign did not return calls for clarification, it appears McCain was referring not just to fees, but also to some corporate tax ""loopholes"" Massachusetts closed while Romney was governor.
Some of them require a degree in accounting to follow.
 
According to a Massachusetts Department of Revenue report, the ""loophole"" changes have brought the state an additional $377-million.
 
""The governor at the time tried to say he was eliminating tax loopholes, not increasing taxes,"" said Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. ""But it's not in dispute that he raised taxes on corporations. We don't see it as 'closing loopholes.' ""
 
Romney was a Republican governor with a Democrat-controlled state legislature. For three years, he proposed cutting the sales tax from 5.3 percent to 5 percent, and all three times, he was rebuffed by the legislature. He was able to secure a one-time $250-million capital gains tax rebate.
 
But was McCain right, did Romney raise taxes $730-million? Depends on what your definition of ""taxes"" is. If you include fees and the elimination of corporate tax loopholes, McCain is at least close to accurate.
 
Here's the math: You take $377-million from closing the so-called corporate tax loopholes and add at least $260-million from fees (Romney's calculation). That puts the total at $637-million. Other estimates on the fees — $500-million, according to the Cato Institute — would put the total well above $730-million.
 
The elimination of corporate tax ""loopholes"" clearly resulted in some businesses paying more taxes and to those businesses, fair or not, it sure must have felt like a tax increase. As for fees, it's nearly impossible to measure with precision how much of the increases were appropriate or simply a revenue-generating measure. We rate the claim Half True.
