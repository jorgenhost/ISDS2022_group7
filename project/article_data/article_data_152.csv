Beaverton School District claims record number of homeless students in Oregon history
","
Beaverton brings to mind terrific Asian restaurants, good schools and traffic hell on the Sunset Highway. It doesn’t often conjure images of homeless children.

Yet a recent press release for a city of Beaverton toy drive says the Beaverton School District  reported a record 1,580 homeless students last year, as well as other sobering facts belying the district’s wealthy image.

""One out of ten children in the Beaverton School District lives below the federal poverty line and more than 37% of the school district's students (over 13,000 kids) receive free or reduced lunch benefits. Last year, Beaverton School District had the highest number of homeless students in the state, 1,580 homeless students, which was also the highest number ever recorded in Oregon.""  

PolitiFact Oregon did a simple search at the state schools superintendent website and found that the figure is correct. The Beaverton School District reported 1,580 homeless students in 2009-10, ranking No. 1 of all school districts.

But is that the highest number of homeless students ever reported in the state?

The previous year’s figures show that’s not so. In 2008-09, Portland Public Schools -- the state’s most populous school district -- reported 1,706 students without permanent shelter, followed by the Medford School District with 1,126. Beaverton was third with 1,114 homeless students. The 1-2-3 line-up was the same in 2007-08.

So last school year, Beaverton was No. 1. Medford maintained its No. 2 spot with 1,139 students homeless. Portland ranked No. 3 with 1,043 students homeless -- about 700 fewer than reported in 2008-09. And no, it’s not as if those students miraculously found low-cost shelter overnight. Apparently, Portland district officials dropped the ball on properly counting heads, as reported in this story  by The Oregonian.

In other words, we don’t expect Beaverton to hold the top spot when the state education department releases its report next year. Also, while the raw number is big in Beaverton, smaller districts routinely report higher percentages of homeless students. Nearly 13 percent of Klamath Falls’ 3,408 students lack steady housing, and more than 9 percent of Medford’s students are homeless. About 4 percent of Beaverton students are homeless.

Asked to clarify, city spokesman Jordan Imlah said, ""Our phrasing was off. What we meant was the Beaverton School District had the highest number of homeless students recorded in 2009-10 and the highest ever recorded for the Beaverton School District.""

Certainly, there are a lot of homeless children in Beaverton, but it’s not accurate to say it was the largest on record in the state. Imlah said he would correct the claim. We rate the statement False.

Dick Greco says he reduced Tampa's debt payments while mayor
","
Former Tampa Mayor Dick Greco on Nov. 29, 2010, announced a fifth run for the city's top job.

At his campaign kickoff, Greco pledged to sling no mud at his six declared opponents in the non-partisan March 1, 2011, election.

""I have a record to run on. Several of them,"" said Greco, who was elected to four terms as mayor, serving 1967 to 1974 and 1995 to 2003.

At Monday's event, he waved a 75-page booklet that details accomplishments in every city department during his last two terms in office, signaling that its contents will form the basis for his campaign.

While it's loaded with information, a statement in the Revenue and Finance Department section on page 56 jumped out at us.

Greco said he ""refinanced $232.6 million in bonds resulting in reduced debt service for the City.""

We wondered: Could a mayor known for his free-spending ways on huge projects have actually lowered the city's debt payments?

City budget documents show that multiple bonds totalling $232.6 million were indeed refinanced during Greco's tenure.

They are: 
• A $45.6 million water and sewer bond issued in 1988 and refinanced in 1998.

• A $52 million utility tax bond issued in 1991 and refinanced in 2001.

• A $66.1 million water and sewer bond issued in 1999 and refinanced in 2001.

• A total of $31.2 million from a sewer state revolving loan fund refinanced into 2002 water and sewer bonds.

• A $37.7 million water and sewer bond issued in 1992 and refinanced in 2002. 
It's true that refinancing those bonds resulted in lower debt payments — by at least $21 million — over several decades.

But the statement in Greco's booklet, by itself, could lead someone to believe that the city's total debt went down during his tenure.

That's not the case.

In fact, Tampa's total debt payments in 1995 were $62.5 million and climbed to $80.2 million in 2002. The city's total debt increased from $682 million to more than $1 billion during that time.

Among the $480.6 million in bonds that contributed to that increased debt:

• $23.6 million issued in 1996 for police headquarters, district offices and fire rescue vehicles

• $62.8 issued in 1999 million to renovate the Hillsborough River water treatment plant

• $19.2 million issued in 1998 for an Ybor parking garage and parking lots

• $190.5 million issued in 1999 to upgrade the city's waste-to-energy facility and construct a new administration building

• $24.8 million issued in 1999 for the electric streetcar and other transportation projects

• $55.6 million issued in 2001 for an art museum, Lowry Park Zoo expansion and other projects

When asked about the statement, Greco said he doesn’t believe it suggests any broad message about the city's total debt payments, and it refers only to specific bonds that were refinanced. 
He notes that the status report on the Revenue and Finance Department also details the issuing of new bonds.

""This sentence puts in context that new bonds were being issued, in addition to bonds that were being refinanced,"" he said.

Adding that all up, we find Greco correctly described the bonds that were refinanced during his years as mayor. 
But taken in isolation, the statement about the lowered debt payments for Tampa is misleading. That's because it doesn't include hundreds of millions in new bonds that were issued at the same time.

Therefore, we rate this statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3F92C0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/03/dick-greco/dick-greco-says-he-reduced-tampas-debt-payments-wh/
"['Retirement', 'Virginia', 'William Howell']","
Virginia Speaker William Howell says Congress is considering confiscating 401(k)s and IRAs
","
Your tax-deferred retirement savings are in danger of being seized by the federal government warns William Howell, speaker of Virginia’s House of Delegates.

""There’s talk in Congress now about basically confiscating your private 401(k) or IRA plan and rolling it into Social Security to strengthen Social Security,"" Howell, R-Stafford, said during a Nov. 13 interview on Freedom & Prosperity Radio, a conservative weekly show broadcast in much of Virginia.  

Howell made the statement to bolster his pet cause: Passage of a U.S. constitutional amendment that would give states the collective right to repeal any law or regulation approved by the U.S. Congress. Under the proposed amendment, which Howell will ask the Virginia General Assembly to endorse this winter, a federal act would be nullified if two-thirds of the states passed resolutions demanding so.

Howell brought up the confiscation of IRAs and 401(k)s, then added: ""Well, if Congress were  ever to pass a law like that, I would think two-thirds of the states would rear up and say, `I want to repeal that law,’ and this (amendment) would give them the right to do that.""

When we asked Howell for the basis of his confiscation claim, he said, ""That idea has been floating around from Democrats for years.""

That was news to the AARP, a powerful lobby for Americans for seniors that watches legislation affecting retirement accounts and Social Security.

""Haven’t heard anything like that at all,"" said Ginger McDaniel, communications director of AARP Virginia, when read Howell’s confiscation comment. ""I’m sure we would know if anything like that was being considered.""

It was also a surprise to Roberton Williams, an economist and senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center in Washington who specializes in pensions and retirement accounts.

""I’ve heard absolutely nothing about that,"" he said. ""If that was a serious suggestion, it would be all over the place in this town.""  

Howell’s office later sent us a variety of sources to back his claim.

They all seem to stem from an Oct 7, 2008 hearing by the House Committee on Education and Labor probing the recession’s impact on retirement security. The values of 401(k)s and IRAs were plummeting. The panel discussed whether the federal government should promote alternative plans that would shield retirement savings from economic turmoil.

One of the speakers was Teresa Ghilarducci, an economics professor at the New School for Social Research, a New York City think tank. She urged creation of a new savings plan that she called a Guaranteed Retirement Account. It would require workers to save 5 percent of their annual pay. The accounts, unlike IRAs and 401Ks, would not be controlled by workers but instead deposited with the federal government, which would kick in $600 a year in the form of a tax credit. Upon a worker’s retirement, the government would guarantee an annual return three percent above inflation.

Ghilarducci also proposed that Congress ""allow"" workers to convert their IRAs and 401Ks into a Guaranteed Retirement Account, according to a video of the hearing. There was no talk about coercion or government seizure of existing accounts. A story on the hearing in the next day’s Washington Post made no reference to a confiscation plan and waited until the 12th paragraph to make its only mention of Ghilarducci. There was no coverage in The New York Times.

Almost a month later, on Nov. 4, 2008,  the conservative Carolina Journal Online used Ghilarducci’s testimony to write, ""Democrats in the U.S. House have been conducting hearings on proposals to confiscate worker’s personal retirement accounts, including 401(k)s and IRAs and convert them into accounts managed by the Social Security Administration."" Howell’s office  sent us a copy of the story.

The web has been replete with unfounded rumors of retirement account confiscation ever since. They usually cite Ghilarducci’s testimony.

Another rumor -- although Howell doesn’t mention it -- puts Vice President Joe Biden behind the seizure effort. The source is said to be a report Biden released in February on the state of the middle class. We read the section on retirement security and found proposals to encourage savings, but nothing that remotely suggested confiscation of retirement assets.

Howell, despite his radio comments, said the public shouldn’t lose sleep worrying about the seizure of retirement plans. He said the November 2 elections, which put Republicans back in control of the House of Representatives, have eased his mind.

""I know its not going to happen now that the Republicans have the House,"" he said. ""But I use it as the kind of thing that could happen in Congress if its powers are unchecked.""

Howell’s radio comments, sounding the confiscation alert, came 11 days after the election.

So let’s review:

Howell says there’s ""talk in Congress about basically confiscating your private 401(k) or IRA,"" which suggests there is serious consideration of such a proposal.  He cites two-year-old testimony by a think-tank economist that makes no mention of seizing tax-deferred saving plans.

We can’t find a single story in a national newspaper that warns of confiscation. AARP, the nation’s largest lobby for seniors with a reported 40 million members, says it ""hasn’t heard anything about it at all."" The web sites reporting government seizure efforts cite statements and reports that, in fact, make no such suggestion.

And it gets even more ridiculous when Howell, himself, says he knows it’s not going to happen. We rate his claim Pants on Fire. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C23C840>],/factchecks/2010/dec/03/william-howell/virginia-speaker-william-howell-says-congress-cons/
"['Energy', 'Oil Spill', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
While others waffled, Rick Scott stuck to his oil drilling script
","
When it comes to the issue of offshore oil drilling, we've seen our share of flip-flopping politicians.

Sitting Florida Gov. Charlie Crist was against oil drilling, then open to it, then fiercely against it. The new leaders of the Florida House and Senate, Rep. Dean Cannon and Sen. Mike Haridopolos, were pushing for drilling in state waters, then they weren't, and now at least Haridpolos wants the state to consider drilling one day.

Then there's the reversal of President Barack Obama, who was ready to open more federal waters to drilling, and now isn't.

All the flip-flopping got us wondering what position Florida's incoming Republican governor Rick Scott had staked out, and whether he's been consistent. Scott gave us an opening to use our Flip-O-Meter when the issue of oil drilling came up on Dec. 2, 2010, during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer.

""We need to become energy independent. We can't do drilling until we do it safely,"" Scott said. But, ""you don't put in a moratorium.

""Let's figure out how we can do it safely because we cannot afford to mess up our beaches or our economy. But I believe (with) the ingenuity of Americans, we will come up with a way to do that.""

How do those statements line up to comments Scott made throughout the campaign?

We decided to examine three critical points -- Scott's comments in the days and weeks after the April Deepwater Horizon Gulf of Mexico oil spill; his time visiting the communities affected by the oil spill in the Panhandle; and his comments ahead of the general election vote when he might soften his position to appeal to moderate voters.

Back in May, after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, Scott was criticized by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink as still supporting increased oil drilling. As evidence, the Sink campaign pointed to both Scott's own campaign website and an interview he gave to the Palm Beach Post.

Scott, on his website, advocated drilling offshore. ""But we must ensure that Florida’s beaches are protected,"" he wrote. ""As we explore the expansion of domestic drilling in the U.S., we must ensure that we have sound policies in place that ensure the companies drilling are doing so in an environmentally sound way and adhering to the strictest of safety standards.""

And to the Post, Scott announced opposition to a state constitutional ban on offshore drilling. ""We need to protect our beaches, break our dependency on foreign oil and hold oil companies accountable when there are problems,"" Scott said. ""As governor, I'll look to strike a balance between responsible exploration that takes every precaution and is far enough from our shores while holding oil companies accountable for their mistakes.""

Later in the summer, but still during his Republican primary against Bill McCollum, the issue resurfaced as Scott toured the Florida Panhandle to see the effect of the Deepwater Horizon spill.

According to news reports, Scott cleverly avoided talking about his position with fishermen in the area, and instead asked them questions about their business. But he told a a business roundtable in Panama City: ""My belief is that we have to continue to look at offshore drilling but we've got to do it safely. I think as a country and a state we've got to become as energy independent as we can.""

Scott tempered his comments slightly in an interview afterward, saying drilling won't happen in the ""foreseeable future. ...We are not going to drill now. ...It's not safe. It doesn't make any sense.""

Lastly, we wanted to search his statements during the general campaign, to see if he moderated his position to appeal to a broader base of voters. What we found is that oil drilling rarely came up. Newspaper editorials cast Scott as pro-drilling -- charges Scott didn't deny -- but rarely did Scott speak about his position during the final weeks of the gubernatorial campaign.

When the Deepwater Horizon spill came up during an Oct. 25 CNN/St. Petersburg Times debate, Scott used the event to criticize Sink for not being directly involved enough. But he didn't state his position on drilling (nor was he asked).

We should note however, that the position on his campaign website has not changed since May.

Let's review. In the days and weeks after the Deepwater Horizon spill, Scott maintained his support for offshore oil drilling so long as it can be done safely. He kept that position after meeting with Panhandle fishermen and businessmen who had been affected by the spill, and never changed his position through the election. Yes, he is guilty perhaps of being savvy enough to downplay a position that may not win votes in the Panhandle or potentially moderate swing voters, but that's not what the Flip-O-Meter measures. It looks for a consistent position. And in this case, the meter found it. So we're making a little history with this one: For the first time PolitiFact Florida rules No Flip.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097819340>],/factchecks/2010/dec/03/rick-scott/while-others-waffled-rick-scott-stuck-his-oil-dril/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Taxes', 'National Association of Manufacturers']","
National Association of Manufacturers cites CBO support for job creation powers of full Bush tax cut extension
","
The National Association of Manufacturers says fully extending the Bush tax cuts will create hundreds of thousands of jobs.

On Dec. 2, 2010, the business group issued a statement to show its support for extending all the Bush tax cuts, which are set to expire on Jan. 1.

Jay Timmons, the group's executive vice president, said that ""manufacturers strongly support extending the 2001 and 2003 tax rates for all taxpayers. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, fully extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts would add between 600,000 and 1.4 million jobs in 2011 and between 900,000 and 2.7 million jobs in 2012.""

We wondered whether the CBO, an independent group that estimates the cost and  impact of legislation, really found that a full extension of the tax cuts would be such a job-creating engine. So we tracked down the original CBO analysis. 
The estimates come from written testimony by CBO director Douglas W. Elmendorf before the Senate Budget Committee on Sept. 28, 2010. Strictly speaking, the trade group has reported the numbers correctly. For 2011, the CBO did indeed estimate that full extension of the tax cuts on a permanent basis would create 600,000 to 1.4 million jobs, plus an addiional 900,000 to 2.7 million jobs in 2012. 
However, a couple of caveats are in order.

What are the alternative scenarios? 

The way the group phrased its statement, you might think that the only alternative to its preferred option would be to let all the tax cuts expire. But the CBO ran the numbers under three other options -- a permanent partial extension (that is, a permanent cut for all but the wealthiest taxpayers, as Obama and many congressional Democrats favor) as well as a two-year extension for all taxpayers and a two-year extension for all but the wealthiest taxpayers.

The option favored by the manufacturers and most Republicans -- full, permanent extension -- does produce the most jobs. But the Democratic option isn't far behind.

In 2011, the permanent partial extension sought by Democrats would generate between 500,000 and 1.2 million jobs, which is about 100,000 to 200,000 fewer jobs (or 14 to 17 percent less) than the Republican option would generate. The picture is similar for 2012.

Meanwhile, both of the options for a temporary extension -- for all taxpayers, or for all but the wealthiest -- would produce fewer jobs than either of the previous two options, according to CBO.

Based on these estimates, you might say that the CBO data points to the GOP option as clearly the best, since it creates more jobs than any of the other alternatives. But it's more complicated than that. This brings us to the second bit of missing context.

What happens after 2012?

CBO found that the economic benefits from a permanent repeal for all taxpayers are higher in the first two years, but that policy comes with troublesome side effects after that.

In his testimony, Elmendorf argued that without other tax hikes or deep spending cuts, a permanent extension of the tax cuts would balloon the deficit to unsustainable levels. That's especially true if Congress extends the tax cuts for all tax brackets.

""A permanent extension of all of those tax cuts without future increases in taxes or reductions in federal spending would roughly double the projected budget deficit in 2020; a permanent extension of those cuts except for certain provisions that would apply only to high-income taxpayers would increase the budget deficit by roughly three-quarters to four-fifths as much,"" Elmendorf testified. ""As a result, if policymakers then wanted to balance the budget in 2020, the required increases in taxes or reductions in spending would amount to a substantial share of the budget—and without significant changes of that sort, federal debt would be on an unsustainable path that would ultimately reduce income. ... Compared with the options examined here for extending the expiring tax cuts, various other options for temporarily reducing taxes or increasing government spending would provide a bigger boost to the economy per dollar of cost to the federal government.""

When we contacted the NAM, Erin Streeter, the vice president for communications, said, ""With an unemployment rate that remains historically high, today’s number edging up to 9.8 percent, we believe the best way forward is job creation. The more jobs we can create, the more economic growth we will see across the nation."" But she didn't push back on the substance of our analysis.

So NAM is accurately quoting the numbers on the Republican alternative but conveniently leaving out the detail that the Democratic alternative is nearly as good at creating jobs. It also ignores the CBO's conclusion that extending the tax breaks for upper-income Americans offers diminishing returns. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C40A100>],/factchecks/2010/dec/03/national-association-manufacturers/national-association-manufacturers-cites-cbo-suppo/

RNC Chair Michael Steele boasts that he has won more elections than any chairman since 1938
","
With Michael's Steele's term as chairman of the Republican National Committee set to expire in January, several candidates have emerged as possible replacements. Steele hasn't yet announced whether he will seek another term, but last week he circulated a memo to RNC members defending himself against some of his GOP critics and highlighting his achievements as chairman.

Asked in an NPR interview on Nov. 8, 2010, about the public grumblings from some Republican officials about RNC fundraising, Steele dismissed the criticism, saying it was ""about the fact that they don't want me in this job, to put it rather bluntly.""

Steele defended his tenure as RNC chairman, saying, ""I have won more elections than any chairman since 1938. In fact, none of my predecessors have been able to put together the kind of combination of wins.""

The battle for RNC chairman promises to heat up quickly in the coming month, so we decided to check Steele's talking point, that he has ""won more elections than any chairman since 1938.""

We e-mailed the RNC press office for backup, and they pointed us to a story in the Cook Political Report that characterized the Republicans' gain of 63 House seats in the 2010 midterm elections as ""the most seismic shift of House seats in a midterm election since 1938.""

We checked it out, and if Steele had specified that he was talking only about seat changes in the House, he'd be accurate. The 64-seat gain by Republicans this year is more than any year since 1939 (when Republicans picked up a whopping 81 seats).

But Steele didn't say seat changes. And, in fact, Republicans won more seats in the House -- 246 -- in 1946. The number of Republican House wins this year is actually still unsettled, as a handful of very close races are still being sorted out. But provided the Republicans currently leading in those races are ultimately declared the winners, the final tally would be 243 Republican seats. That's awfully close but not quite as many House wins for Republicans as in 1946.

More importantly, though, Steele didn't say he was talking only about the House. The RNC also supports Republican candidates in U.S. Senate, governor and state legislature elections.

To be clear, Republicans did very well in all of these areas in the 2010 midterms. But the GOP has had better years in Senate and gubernatorial elections. An analysis by the American Enterprise Institute of 100 years worth of midterm election gains made by the party out of power shows that the six seats picked up in the Senate this year are fewer than in 1942 (10 seats); 1946 (13 seats); and 1994 (nine seats). And when it comes to governor elections, you also don't need to go back as far as 1938 to find a year in which Republicans picked up more state capitals. This year, six governors' seats changed to Republican, but 11 governors' seats changed to Republican in 1994.

As for state legislature elections, it was a banner election for Republicans this year, with about 690 seats switching to Republican. Because some states hold state legislative elections in odd years, the National Conference of State Legislatures prefers to look at two-year cycles. By that measure, Republicans have gained 724 seats, Tim Storey, an elections analyst with the NCSL.

There are now more Republicans holding state legislative seats than at any point since 1928, Storey said. Of the 7,382 total state legislative seats, 53 percent are now occupied by Republicans.

""It's definitely an historic high-water mark,"" Storey said.

But strictly speaking, Republicans gained even more state legislative seats in 1966 (when they picked up 762 seats -- 38 more than in this two-year cycle).

The authors of the AEI analysis, James Fortier and Jennifer Marsico, also calculated a midterm power ranking (based on the average of their rankings in four categories -- House, Senate, governor and state legislature elections). The Republican gains in 2010 ranked sixth. That's behind 1994 (a year of major Republican gains) and 1958 (which Democrats dominated).

""Overall, it was one of the best years for Republicans in the last 60 years,"" Fortier said.

If Steele decides to seek another term as chairman of the RNC, he can certainly boast about significant Republican gains in the midterm election. But when he said, ""I have won more elections than any chairman since 1938,"" that's only true if you were to consider just the seat changes -- as opposed to the actual number of wins -- in the U.S. House. Republicans also picked up seats in the Senate this year, but they gained more in 1942, 1946 and 1994; Republican gains in governor elections were greater in 1994; and GOP gains in state legislatures were greater in 1966. And so we rate Steele's claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C22EF40>],/factchecks/2010/dec/03/michael-steele/rnc-chair-michael-steele-boasts-he-has-won-more-el/
"['Wisconsin', 'Lee Holloway']","
Lee Holloway says he got more than twice as much money for County Grounds land than Scott Walker would have
","
In his first interview since Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker was elected governor, County Board Chairman Lee Holloway didn’t mince many words.

With Walker soon to depart, giving Holloway a chance to serve as interim county executive, the chairman held forth on a variety of topics -- describing the ideal person as having the qualities of, well, Lee Holloway.

Here’s a sample of an exchange between Holloway and the weekly Shepherd Express newspaper, which published the account in its Nov. 17, 2010 edition.

Shepherd: Regarding the candidates for county executive, what sort of person would be the best for the job? What type of person does the county need?

Holloway: I think it needs a person like Lee Holloway, to be honest with you. I’m sincere about that. I think I’ve got all of the skills and the ability. And the big initiatives all came from me, for a long time: the health (insurance) initiatives, which saved $100 million for the county; the pension obligation bonds — he (Scott Walker) couldn’t get the votes; the sales tax. I tried to save Midwest Express, and did everything I could. He couldn’t get the votes for that. I created the GAMP program, which lasted for 16 to 18 years, and it became a national model. The UWM (expansion), that’s my deal. He was talking about $6 million; I came up with $13 million. Those are a lot of big projects. He’ll come up and try to get publicity and say, ‘Me and Chairman Holloway…’ And he doesn’t veto my stuff. ""

That’s a lot of boasting from the effusive chairman, who has not ruled out appointing himself interim executive.

We decided to take a closer look at the comment about the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee project, which relates to land the UWM Foundation purchased to construct its Innovation Park campus on the County Grounds in Wauwatosa. The foundation’s first payment of $5 million is due Dec. 15, 2010.

So, did Holloway really drive a harder bargain than Walker, getting $7 million more for the county and its taxpayers?

The project has been under discussion for several years, and has also included land division, a development plan, rezoning and creation of a tax incremental financing district from the city of Wauwatosa.

In the case of the land deal, the county and UWM Foundation have an agreement for purchase of the 88-acre tract, located east of U.S. Highway 45 and north of W. Watertown Plank Road for $13.55 million.

When talks began, each side came to the table with its own outside appraisal of the land’s value. UWM’s was for about $8 million; the county’s came in at $13 million

Holloway was involved in crafting the county’s response for the next level of negotiations, moving UWM closer to -- and possibly above -- the county figure, according county and UWM Foundation staff involved in the talks.

Holloway pushed for the county to use a formula that took into account the future value of the parcel, once it was fully developed, said Craig Dillman, the county’s manager of real estate services.

The formula, called a floor to area ratio, is commonly used in real estate development. Holloway argued the development could be more dense than the UWM projections.

""That’s how the higher value came to be achieved,"" Dillman said.

The two sides eventually agreed not only on a price of $13.55 million -- but also on a formula that calls for future payments to the county if UWM’s development exceeds projections.

What did others say about Holloway’s role?

UWM Foundation President David Gilbert said he didn’t know the extent of Holloway’s involvement in the county side of the talks. He said Holloway was one of several players.

""The main person we negotiated with was Craig Dillman,"" Gilbert said.

Walker Chief of Staff Tom Nardelli said Holloway was trying to take credit for something that was a group effort on the county’s part.

""Holloway always believed he could get more"" for the land, Nardelli said. ""If Scott said five, he’d say go to six.""

In his claim, Holloway argues the county -- as in Walker -- was ready to settle for $6 million.

But no one we talked with recalls that figure ever coming up -- after all, UWM’s appraisal was for $8.5 million. And no one associated that figure with Walker, who Holloway claims was ready to accept it. Indeed, Walker was not at the table himself -- Dillman was there.

We asked Holloway for an interview several times. He didn’t respond.

County Board spokesman Harold Mester said Holloway recalls that the $6 million figure was ""discussed behind the scenes"" by UWM and county negotiators, before the first offer was presented by UWM.

""The County Executive was ready to sell that land at a lower price,"" Mester said. ""The chairman said ‘Wait a minute. This is one of the most valuable land parcels we have, at the crossroads of the state of Wisconsin.’ The chairman thought there was a lot more value there.""

Said Mester: ""The chairman takes credit for getting more money for the taxpayers and that’s what’s important.""

Nardelli responded: ""That was all being negotiated. Scott never wanted less. It’s assinine to suggest that.""

Let’s score this one out.

Holloway bragged he got $7 million more for taxpayers than Walker was willing to accept from the UWM Foundation. From all accounts, Holloway was involved in the talks, and pushed for the formula that was ultimately used and the final price tag was about $5 million more than UWM’s initial appraisal. So some him credit for the higher price.

But there’s no concrete evidence that Walker was willing to simply accept the UWM appraisal -- and certainly none that he wanted to go $2.5 million lower. That wouldn’t be much negotiating at all.  We rate Holloway’s statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809754FD40>],/factchecks/2010/dec/03/lee-holloway/lee-holloway-says-he-got-more-twice-much-money-cou/
"['Georgia', 'Elections', 'National Review']","
The GOP made historic gains at the state level this year
","
That’s not a new story in Georgia, which elected its first Republican governor since Reconstruction in 2002. A few years later, both chambers of the state Legislature had GOP majorities. Those majorities increased in the 2010 election cycle, and a half-dozen lawmakers elected as Democrats on Nov. 2 have fled to the GOP in the election's aftermath. 
  
But nationally, did Republicans actually pick up historic ground in state legislatures in last month’s election as the National Review stated? 
PolitiFact Georgia checked with Tim Storey, an elections analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures and a guy who knows about as much about political shifts at the state level as anyone around. 
""It’s a much different landscape than it was prior to the election,"" Storey said. 
The Colorado-based Storey said Republicans gained 691 state legislative seats in the November election. Nationwide, they now hold 3,928 seats to 3,366 for Democrats. 
""It was definitely historic gains,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""It’s the most GOP [state] legislators since 1928."" 
Republicans had the momentum going into the election, he said, but some questioned whether the GOP could surpass its 1994 performance, when the GOP picked up 525 seats at the state level. They easily surpassed that number and saw the biggest party shift in legislative seats since 1966, Storey said. 
Some of the state pickups surprised even the experts. Minnesota, the same state that made Democrat Al Franken a U.S. senator in 2008, saw its Legislature taken over by the GOP. And the Michigan House of Representatives went Republican. 
The GOP tilt was even greater in the South, where state-level offices had been trending Republican for two decades. Still, when the election began, 14 legislative chambers in the South were controlled by Democrats and 14 by Republicans. When the dust cleared, 19 of the region’s 28 chambers were controlled by Republicans. 
The 2010 election cycle in the South represents a ""historic tipping point,"" Storey said. For the first time since Reconstruction, the GOP holds a majority of chambers and seats. 
The online journal Politico recently ran the headline ""Democratic South finally falls."" 
The change has been going on for some time, writer Jonathan Martin noted in the article. 
""But what this year’s elections, and the subsequent party switching, have made unambiguously clear is that the last ramparts have fallen and political realignment has finally taken hold in the South’s last citadels of Democratic strength: the state houses,"" Martin wrote. 
Democrats lost both chambers of the legislatures in Alabama and North Carolina. Democrats now control both legislative chambers in just two Southern states, Arkansas and Mississippi. 
The realignment of power in the state legislatures can have enormous consequences. State lawmakers soon will begin the process of redrawing political boundaries, a process known as redistricting that occurs every 10 years. 
The party in power will obviously try to draw those lines to benefit itself, so the GOP romp of 2010 could have some real staying power.

Todd Staples says 21 percent of 2009 Texas high school graduates enrolled that fall in a four-year public university
","
Who says campaigns fade in import after Election Day?

On Nov. 11, for instance, we came across a statement about Texas high-school graduates that would be notable any time.

Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples, making a case for workforce training, writes on the ""issues"" part of his campaign website: ""Preparing our students for a global economy means more and more of them will require college degrees, yet in the fall of 2009, only 21 percent of Texas high school graduates enrolled in a four-year public university.""

One in five hustled to college? Staples' posted statement includes a link to a Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board website, ""High School to College Linkages."" With advice from Staples' spokesman Bryan Black, we isolated a spreadsheet on the site indicating the percentage of public high school graduates who went on to higher education the fall after their spring graduations from 2000 through 2009.

And according to the spreadsheet, 21 percent of the state's more than 264,000 2009 graduates enrolled that fall in four-year public institutions of higher education, with 28.5 percent enrolling in public two-year institutions and 4.4 percent marked as attending an in-state private or independent college or university. Dominic Chavez, senior director for external relations at the coordinating board, confirmed the figures for us.

But we noticed a difference between the board breakdown and Staples' statement. The board's 21 percent refers solely to graduates who enrolled in Texas institutions, while Staples' statement refers to graduates who went to any four-year public university.

Also, the board breakdown gives no information for many graduates. Nearly 42 percent of the 2009 graduates are categorized as ""not found,"" meaning the students' identifying numbers -- usually Social Security numbers -- did not show up in enrollment records of state higher education institutions that fall, according to a footnote on the chart and Chavez. Another 4 percent of graduates are listed as not trackable; those graduates had non-standard ID numbers ""that will not find a match at Texas higher education institutions,"" a footnote says.

We wondered too about 2009 graduates who went to college out of state. Chavez told us the board did not research that because its research reach extends to Texas colleges only.

Chavez said, though, that the board earlier paid for such information from the National Student Clearinghouse, a nonprofit that describes itself online as the nation's ""trusted source for student degree and enrollment verification."" Board spokesman Andy Kesling later told us that 4 to 5 percent of 2003 Texas high-school graduates enrolled that fall in out-of-state institutions of higher education; the clearinghouse's data set did not include colleges in Oklahoma, which attracts some Texas graduates, and did not specify the types of schools the graduates were attending. The same year, the board says, 20 percent of Texas high-school graduates enrolled that fall in a Texas four-year public institution. Kesling said it would be fair to conclude that more than 24 to 25 percent of graduates enrolled in a four-year college in or out of Texas (counting the unknown share of students who hitchhiked to Oklahoma) in fall 2003.

Black, Staples' spokesman, said by e-mail that Staples' statement was in a column focused on Texas. ""It's clear, both because of the context of the article"" and that the coordinating board is the cited source, Black said, that Staples is commenting on graduates enrolled in Texas four-year public universities.

We don't see that clarity.

Upshot: Staples said that only 21 percent of Texas high school graduates in 2009 went on to a four-year public university, without noting that the statistic only applies to public universities in Texas.

While the state has no data on the number of 2009 graduates who enrolled in out-of-state colleges, it stands to reason that more than 21 percent of graduates went to four-year public universities across the country.

"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Families', 'Jobs', 'Pundits', 'Glenn Beck']","
Glenn Beck paints beleaguered Wilmington, Ohio, as real life Bedford Falls
","Radio host and Fox News personality Glenn Beck loves to tell a story with dramatic flair. And he’s latched onto one this holiday season that’s familiar to many Ohioans.

It’s the story of Wilmington, a town of 13,000 people in Southwest Ohio that has lost about 8,600 jobs since DHL Express, it largest employer, pulled out in 2008. The job losses the small town has suffered since DHL’s departure have been the subject of presidential campaign stops, celebrity charity events and numerous media reports, including two from CBS’s vaunted 60 Minutes.

In Beck’s version of the story, Wilmington is real life Bedford Falls, the fictitious town in the holiday classic, It’s a Wonderful Life.

Wilmington, Beck said on his Nov. 22 radio show, is ground zero of the recession, and its people – like those in Bedford Falls -- are pulling together to save the town through self reliance and prayer.

What makes the Wilmington really special, he continued, is that Wilmington refuses government assistance, a key tenet of the political philosophy he espouses on his shows.

""It went from the No. 1 most up-and-coming city, and a city everybody wants to live in, to ground zero. And this town hasn’t taken any money from the government. They don’t want any money from the government,"" he said on the show.

Beck then noted how Wilmington area churches are working together to provide food for the citizens and asking God -- not the state or federal government -- to fill its food pantries.

To highlight his Wilmington story, Beck will hold a show titled ""America’s First Christmas"" at city’s Murphy Theatre on December 15. The proceeds will be donated to a charity in the city.

""I’m going there because I think this town needs to be highlighted,"" he said. ""I think this town is going to help the rest of the country, not the other way around.""

With such a large spotlight headed shining on the small town, Politifact Ohio decided to review Beck’s storyline that Wilmington shuns government assistance. We asked for Beck’s sources, but our e-mails to his producer went unanswered. So, we looked ourselves.

We quickly found Beck’s story full of holes.   Immediately after DHL announced the closing of its Wilmington air hub, elected officials at the city, state and federal levels began seeking help for DHL workers. The federal government awarded a $3.87 million national emergency grant to Ohio in November 2008 specifically to provide job training and other aid to DHL workers in Wilmington and the surrounding area. It was administered through the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. The area has since received a second national emergency grant worth $4.1 million.

Wilmington and Clinton County benefited handsomely from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, commonly known as the stimulus bill, that was passed in February 2009.

The tracking website for the stimulus program allows anybody, including Beck, to search by ZIP code to find the total money spent within the postal district.

Using Wilmington’s zip code – 45177, which includes the surrounding county – the site shows that the area received $7,009,811 in stimulus money through September.

The figure includes money that went to the Wilmington city schools, Clinton County Department of Jobs and Family Services and the Clinton County Community Action Group, a non-profit organization that aids the poor in in the region and provides free weatherization to residents.

The city of Wilmington received a $79,231 stimulus grant to provide programs designed to prevent and control crime; a $167,392 grant for investment in rural public transit vehicles, and about $4 million to replace roads, curbs and sidewalks, typically replaced by residents.

In addition, the Ohio Department of Development is extensively involved in the community. It has provided money to Clinton County Port Authority to help redevelop the Wilmington air park. It’s also offering Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, a new company operating at the air park, more than $5.2 million in state assistance to grow its business there.

Wilmington Mayor David Raizk, who cited several other sources of federal assistance flowing to the city, said he’s chasing any government help he can get.

""I’ve beat on more doors than I can count,"" he says. ""Not because we are looking for hand out - but we are looking for a hand up. My job is to get whatever assistance I can get for the citizens here and to help create jobs for them.""

So where does all this leave Beck’s premise that Wilmington is a place that shuns government help?

Beck took enough literary license in his holiday tale to make Frank Capra blush. His statement isn’t just false. It’s also ridiculous enough to earn a Politifact rating of Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A41ED40>],/factchecks/2010/dec/03/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-paints-beleaguered-wilmington-ohio-real/
"['Rhode Island', 'Education', 'Angel Taveras']","
Taveras says Providence teachers go five or six years without being evaluated
","When Mayor-elect Angel Taveras takes over as Providence's chief executive next month, he will inherit the largest and one of the most troubled school systems in the state.

Taveras, himself a product of the city's school system, promised during his campaign to push for the development of more rigorous teacher evaluations.  

In a post-election appearance on WPRI-12's ""Newsmakers"" last week, Taveras repeated that pledge.

""With respect to teachers, we need to recruit the very best teachers, to give them the support they need and to evaluate them,"" he said. ""Let me explain what I mean. Right now teachers can go five or six years without an evaluation. Five or six years! I was shocked to learn that when I was running for office. We're beginning to change that.""

Unlike the mayor-elect, we'll stop short of saying we were ""shocked"" to hear that. But, if true, it certainly seems infrequent, particularly for new teachers.

Taveras' team didn't provide backup for his statement,  so we consulted the Providence teachers contract, available online.

We learned that as per the contract, non-tenured teachers, those who have been on the job fewer than three years, must be evaluated once a year by their school principal or another administrator.

But Providence teachers automatically become tenured after three years and the vast majority of them -- 94.4 percent of the 1,939 teachers -- are tenured, according to the Providence School Department.

For those teachers, the performance review timetable is less specific. The contract stipulates: ""Tenured teachers shall be evaluated on a scheduled basis. The schedule shall be constructed by the Teacher Evaluation Committee.""

That committee, made up of district officials as well as union representatives, has long dictated that tenured teachers be evaluated every five years. That means that once a teacher receives tenure at three years, he or she is not reviewed again until his or her eighth year, then the 13th year and ongoing on a five-year cycle, said Thomas Ramirez, the assistant superintendent of human resources.

District officials and Providence Teacher's Union President Steve Smith both say the five-year schedule is nearly always followed. The only exception would be if a principal determines that a particular teacher is struggling and needs a more immediate performance review.

So Taveras' claim that teachers can go five years without an evaluation is accurate. Given the district's small number of untenured teachers, most do go that long. The mayor-elect stretches the numbers a bit, however, when he references the six-year figure.  

We find this statement to be Mostly True.

But while we have your attention, we want to mention the larger context.

Like Taveras, the teachers union and the district agree that the evaluation system needs improvement. Kim Rose, spokeswoman for the Providence schools, said the district believes teachers need to be evaluated more frequently and with ""a more robust evaluation tool.""

Right now evaluations are more like brief snapshots of a teacher's performance. They typically involve one or more short classroom visits, but no formal analysis of the teacher's lesson plans, or of the performance of his or her students.

Both the state Department of Education, led by Education Commissioner Deborah A. Gist and the teachers union have launched efforts to develop more rigorous review policies. The Rhode Island affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers has received multiple grants, including one from the federal government to help in its effort. Over the past several months, the two sides have been working together to merge their initiatives and have suggested they could unveil a shared evaluation model next year.

Whether Providence moves forward with the change that stakeholders on all sides say they want will be, in part, up to Taveras. After months of critiquing the schools that educated him, the mayor-elect will soon have a direct hand in shaping the School Department that educated him.

We'll be watching to see whether he makes good on those promises.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'John Boehner']","
John Boehner says ""the American people spoke pretty loudly. They said stop all the looming tax hikes""
","
The Jan. 1, 2011, expiration of George W. Bush's tax cuts is approaching, and the parties are working feverishly to win public support for their position. Republicans have taken a firm stance in favor of extending the tax cuts for everyone, while President Barack Obama and many congressional Democrats want to extend them only for families earning less than $250,000. 
Following a Dec. 1, 2010, meeting between congressional Republican leaders and newly elected Republican governors, Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, who is poised to become House speaker early next year, said the Democrats were out of touch with public opinion. 
""I don't know what my colleagues across the aisle didn't hear during the election -- the American people spoke pretty loudly,"" Boehner said. ""They said stop all the looming tax hikes and to cut spending."" 
Our friends at NBC's First Read noticed a discrepancy between Boehner's comment and national exit poll data. ""Actually,"" First Read wrote, ""here’s what the public said about the Bush tax cuts, according to the exit polls last month: 40 percent said to continue ALL of the cuts, 36 percent said to continue them for families who earn less than $250,000 a year, and an additional 15 percent said to expire them for all. So a majority -- 51 percent -- backed either the Democratic position or wants all the cuts to expire."" 
We thought we'd expand upon First Read's research and look at additional polls. We found four taken since the election that address the question of what to do with the expiring Bush tax cuts. (We're keeping the focus narrow by not addressing the question of whether the American people support spending cuts; we found a wide variety of different questions on that issue in these polls, making it a harder question to gauge.) 
Here are the questions on the Bush tax cuts in each survey: 
USA Today/Gallup poll, Nov. 19-21, 2010 
What do you think Congress should do about the income tax cuts passed under George W. Bush that are set to expire at the end of this year? 
Keep the tax cuts for all Americans regardless of income: 40 percent 
Keep the tax cuts but set new limits on how much of wealthy Americans' income is eligible for the lower rates: 44 percent 
Allow the tax cuts to expire: 13 percent

A follow-up question clarified where Americans would draw that income line, using some widely discussed income thresholds. 
Keep tax cuts for all: 40 percent 
Keep tax cuts up to $1 million income: 5 percent 
Keep tax cuts up to $500,000 income: 12 percent 
Keep tax cuts up to $250,000 income: 26 percent 
Let tax cuts expire: 13 percent 
Associated Press-CNBC poll, Nov. 18-22, 2010 
The tax cuts that were passed in 2001 will expire this year if they are not continued. Which of the following best describes what you think Congress should do about the tax cuts?

Continue the tax cuts for everyone: 34 percent 
Allow the tax cuts for people earning more than $250,000 to expire, but continue them for other people: 50 percent 
Allow the tax cuts to expire for everyone: 14 percent

NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, Nov. 11-15, 2010

Congress will soon decide whether to keep in place the existing tax cuts enacted during President Bush’s time in office, or allow them to expire. Which one of the following options would be your preference for what they should do?

Keep in place the tax cuts for everyone permanently: 23 percent 
Keep in place all the tax cuts for everyone for another year to three years: 23 percent 
Eliminate the tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000 per year, but keep them for those earning less than that: 39 percent 
Eliminate all the tax cuts permanently: 10 percent

Quinnipiac poll, Nov. 8-15, 2010

How should Congress vote on the Bush-era tax cuts: continue them for all, continue them only for families who earn less than $250,000 a year, or let them expire for all?

Continue for all: 35 percent 
Continue for those below $250,000: 43 percent 
Expire for all: 14 percent

How about if this was the choice on tax cuts; continue them for all, continue them only for families who earn less than $500,000 a year, or let them expire for all?

Continue for all: 33 percent 
Continue for those below $500,000: 40 percent 
Expire for all: 18 percent

While each poll asked the question with slight variations, some general patterns emerge.

It's true that overwhelming majorities favor extending some of the tax cuts -- greater than 80 percent in every poll. But Boehner said Americans want to ""stop all the looming tax hikes,"" and the polls don't support such a sweeping claim.

The percentage of people who favor extending the tax cuts for every income level -- which is the formulation Boehner used in his comment -- ranges from 23 percent to 40 percent. That is quite a bit short of a majority.

More important for our analysis, in the three of these polls that asked the question the same way, Boehner's position didn't even achieve a plurality from poll respondents. Instead, the highest level of support for any specific course of action was actually the Obama position -- extending tax cuts for those below $250,000 and not for those above that line. Support for this position ranged from 39 percent to 50 percent.

When pollsters widened the range of policy options, the pattern broke down somewhat. In the USA Today/Gallup poll, for instance, a significant minority of those who favored an income cutoff for the tax cut extension wanted that cutoff to be higher than Obama's preferred $250,000. And when NBC/Wall Street Journal pollsters asked about a instituting a temporary tax-cut extension for another one to three years -- a widely discussed compromise option for the White House and Congress -- it won the support of about one-quarter of poll respondents.

Still, the general pattern we see in these polls is that Americans are more likely to side with the Obama position than with the Republican position, though neither view won a clear majority.

When we contacted Boehner's office, a spokesman said that the poll results were shaped by the wording. ""The question should be, 'Do you think taxes should go up on January 1?'"" the spokesman said. ""In the real world, if I make the same salary next year and I pay more taxes, that’s a tax hike. If I pay less, that’s a tax cut.""

We don't doubt the results would have been more favorable to the GOP position if the wording had been changed, but we're not convinced by that argument. It is not an all or nothing choice. In fact, it's a choice between Democrats who propose letting the tax cuts expire for those earning more than $250,000, and Republicans who want to extend the cuts for everyone. The wording in the polls seems like a perfectly accurate reflection of those options. 
So we find that Boehner is wrong to claim the public supports his position. The polls show that while many Americans oppose an across-the-board expiration of the Bush tax cuts, it is not accurate to say the public spoke ""pretty loudly"" that Congress should ""stop all the looming tax hikes."" A plurality of the ""American people"" actually support what amounts to a tax hike for the wealthiest Americans. So we rate Boehner's comment False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C064200>],/factchecks/2010/dec/02/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-american-people-spoke-pretty-lou/
"['Florida', 'Ronda Storms']","
Ronda Storms says local transit agency forces cab drivers to wear socks
","
A Republican state senator from Hillsborough County wants to do away with an independent agency that regulates the county's taxicab drivers, saying the agency is duplicative, costly, and rife with inane and unnecessary regulations.

Among those regulations, says state Sen. Ronda Storms, a former Hillsborough County commissioner, is a requirement that cab drivers wear socks. Storms says she wants to propose a bill during next spring's state legislative session eliminating the Hillsborough transit agency, formally called the Public Transportation Commission.

""They have a rule that says cabbies have to wear socks,"" Storms said in a Dec. 1, 2010, St. Petersburg Times article. ""I mean, please. Come on.""

This fact check is about feet. (A PolitiFact Florida first).

But before we get to the bottom of it all, a little background on the Public Transportation Commission.

The commission was created in 1976 by the state Legislature to establish a countywide taxicab regulatory agency and to unify different taxicab ordinances created by the cities of Tampa, Temple Terrace and Plant City. In 1982, the Legislature added vans, limousines and transportation for the handicapped to the commission's regulatory scope. In 1987, basic life support ambulances and government wreckers came under the commission's purview.

The seven-member transportation board is made up of county commissioners and city representatives from Tampa, Plant City and Temple Terrace. It's the only agency of its kind in the state.

And it's had its share of troubles.

Over the years, the commission has been criticized for hiring an executive director that didn't meet job requirements, paying a lobbyist who had worked as a campaign consultant for the commission's board chairman, and forcing a free electric shuttle service out of business. 
Storms told the St. Petersburg Times that the agency's most important functions, like making sure vehicles for hire are safe and drivers aren't a danger to passengers, can be handled by the Hillsborough County staff. 
The agency is funded entirely by fees paid by drivers and taxicab companies. It does have interlocal agreements with the county to pay for legal services, however. And Storms says since the agency was created by the state, state workers must spend time monitoring the agency's activities. 
""It makes good sense to me. It's what we stand for as Republicans. Less government, more efficiency, more streamlining. It's what the voters want,"" she said of her bill. ""What is it that they're doing to justify the additional layer of government?"" 
Audie Canney, Storm's legislative aide, said Storm found the sock requirement in the Public Transportation Commission's rules for taxi drivers.

In Section 6, under driver duties, the agency articulates a dress code for male and female drivers. 
Later, the dress code says wearing ""sandals, or any type of open-toed footwear"" is prohibited. In reading the rules, we noted that it's clear that male drivers are supposed to wear socks, but there is no such requirement for female drivers.

So we turned to the Public Transportation Commission's interim executive director, Cesar Padilla, who has worked for the commission since 2000.

He said the dress code rule has developed over the years. But here's how he explained it to us. ""The taxi drivers have to have collared shirts, if they wear shorts, the have to be hemmed up,"" Padilla said. ""They cannot wear open-toed shoes, no flip-flops and they must wear socks. That's one of the many rules there.""

So socks are a must. Padilla said the rules are in place to make passengers feel comfortable. ""When a person comes into Tampa International Airport and they get into a taxi, that's the first impression they're going to have of this area,"" he said. He also said dress codes are common for agencies that regulate taxicabs, so he wasn't sure what the big deal was about.

And we did find several municipalities and governments that have dress codes in place for taxicab drivers. Miami-Dade County's dress code is a collared shirt, slacks and closed toe shoes. In Orlando, men must wear pants while females ""may wear skirts or dresses providing that the hem is not more than two (2) inches above the top of the knee joint and is not strapless or halter type."" Drivers must wear a collared shirt with sleeves and shoes and socks, except that ""females may wear (open-toed) footwear providing that such footwear is high-heeled and is not clogs, thongs, shower shoes or sandals."" In Daytona Beach, ""neither a male or female driver is permitted to wear a T-shirt, tank top, body suit, swimwear or jogging suit as an outer garment, nor sandals or other type of open footwear, or ballcaps.""

But that's a side note to the claim we're checking.

Storms put her foot down when it comes to Hillsborough's Public Transportation Commission, saying some of its regulations are unnecessary and inane, specifically a requirement that taxicab drivers wear socks. She's right that cab drivers have a dress code that includes socks, but it's not as uncommon as she makes it sounds. Still, on the facts she's right. We say True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976A8400>],/factchecks/2010/dec/02/ronda-storms/ronda-storms-says-local-transit-agency-forces-cab-/

No, Donald Trump didn't cancel funding for Barack Obama presidential library
","A viral story on Facebook says that President Donald Trump decided not to pay for Barack Obama’s presidential library, but no such thing happened. Trump is ""cancelling funding for Obama’s free house and library,"" the Jan. 17 headline on the Patriot Report said. The story provides no evidence and contradicts actual information about how the Obama library will be funded. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The Patriot Report said that after Trump learned that Obama ordered the U.S. Education Department to divert more than $8 million to build the library, Trump rescinded the money and diverted it to privately held charter schools. Michelle Obama was going to get a private residence on the top floor, but Trump supposedly cancelled that, too. ""Obama will have no recourse but to try to raise the money or pay for the project himself, but without the big donors and connections of a great Republican president, he’ll probably be stuck buying something that looks like a Bush’s guest home,"" the story said. In the past, presidential libraries have been constructed with private or non-federal funds donated to nonprofit organizations. Some libraries have also received construction and development funding from state and/or local governments. The library is then transferred to the federal government and operated and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration, a federal agency, through its congressionally appropriated operating budget. Some staff and programs at the libraries are paid for with funds from associated private foundations organized to fund the construction of the library. In May 2017, the Obama Foundation and the records agency announced that the arrangement for Obama’s library would be different from existing presidential libraries. The Obama Presidential Center in Chicago won’t be in the library network operated by NARA. The center will be privately operated and built by the Obama Foundation, which will raise money for the center. Rather than build a presidential library to hold paper records, the Obama Foundation is providing NARA with digital records. NARA will store and preserve the original materials in an existing NARA facility. University of Louisville Professor Benjamin Hufbauer, an expert on presidential libraries, said the Obama library gains a couple of benefits by opting out of the typical presidential library system. First, the library won’t have to raise the congressionally-mandated 60 percent of the cost of construction endowment for future maintenance. Also, the library won’t have to build an archival facility for documents, films, video, electronic records. Similar ridiculous stories about the cancellation of funding for Obama’s library have circulated on other websites for months. Factcheck.org found the same story on the Last Line of Defense in December 2016. While that website had a disclaimer that said ""we present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist,"" the Patriot Report had no such disclaimer. We found no evidence that Trump had rescinded any such funding for the library. In reality, the Obama Foundation will raise money for the center in Chicago.

Do 25 percent of rural Georgia residents lack high-speed internet?
","Many rural Georgians have been left behind because they don’t have access to high-speed internet, said Brian Kemp, a Republican seeking to become Georgia’s next governor. ""With 25 percent of rural residents without access to high-speed internet, bringing this access to all of Georgia is a fundamental component of our plan to strengthen rural Georgia,"" Kemp said on his campaign website. High-speed internet can help small businesses, improve access to quality healthcare and spur economic development, said Kemp, currently Georgia’s Secretary of State. We wondered if Kemp was right about the share of rural Georgians without high-speed internet and found that he accurately cited information stemming from a 2016 Federal Communications Commission report on broadband deployment. High-speed internet is a term often used interchangeably with broadband. Broadband ""commonly refers to high-speed internet access that is always on and faster than the traditional dial-up access,"" according to the FCC. (Dial-up uses a modem and standard phone line to establish an internet connection.) Broadband technologies include Digital Subscriber Line, or DSL, cable modem and fiber. The FCC benchmark for fixed (not mobile) broadband internet is speeds of 25 Megabits per second for downloads and 3 Megabits per second for uploads. A section of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the FCC to determine annually whether advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans ""in a reasonable and timely fashion,"" and if not, to take immediate action to accelerate deployment. Regarding Georgia’s rural population without high-speed internet access, Kemp’s campaign referred us to a May 2017 presentation from the House Budget and Research Office given at a House Rural Development Council meeting. Part of that presentation said an estimated 626,070 individuals, or 25 percent of the rural population, were without access to 25 Mbps/3 Mbps internet. Those figures trace back to the FCC’s 2016 Broadband Progress Report, which also found that 39 percent of all rural Americans did not have access to broadband internet. ""The largest factor preventing access to unlimited ‘high-speed’ broadband is the cost of buildout for the infrastructure,"" said Eric McRae, associate director of the Carl Vinson Institute of Government at the University of Georgia. Depending on the technology being implemented, cost can range from $18,000 to $30,000 per mile, McRae said. ""Many carriers are developing new technologies (wireless) to help drive down the cost of buildout to make it a more cost-effective endeavor in the rural portions of the state,"" he said. A more recent FCC report on broadband deployment, released this month, found that 71.9 percent of rural Georgians had access to fixed terrestrial broadband at speeds of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps, suggesting 28.1 percent did not. The new report also looked at populations’ access to mobile internet, but said it was not establishing a benchmark for mobile, as it does for fixed services. While both fixed and mobile services enable access to information and entertainment, there are notable differences between the two technologies and limitations in the FCC’s data collection, the report said. Mobile broadband speeds can vary based on capabilities of consumers’ devices and transmissions can be subject to environmental factors that fixed services may not face, the FCC said. Generally, FCC reports have shown that rural communities tend to be at a disadvantage in receiving high-speed internet. PolitiFact Missouri found that Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., accurately claimed in September 2017 that nearly 2/3 of rural Missourians don’t have access to broadband. Kemp said that in in Georgia, ""25 percent of rural residents"" are ""without access to high-speed internet."" Kemp’s claim is backed by data reported by the FCC in 2016. New data shows that the percentage of rural residents without access to fixed terrestrial broadband is 28.1 percent. We rate Kemp’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974AF380>],/factchecks/2018/feb/12/brian-kemp/does-25-percent-rural-georgia-lack-access-high-spe/
"['Abortion', 'Illinois', 'Jeanne Ives']","
Campaign ad falsely claims Rauner made taxpayers fund late abortions
","Until recently, state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton was little known beyond the capitol dome. But last fall, she catapulted herself into the spotlight by launching an insurgent primary challenge against incumbent Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner over what she characterized as his failure to stand up for conservative values. Chief among Rauner’s offenses, Ives has said, was his decision to sign legislation that repealed restrictions limiting state employee and Medicaid health plans’ coverage of abortions. Soon after announcing her campaign, she called the issue ""the straw that broke the camel’s back."" So it was no surprise on Wednesday that Ives’ campaign released a radio ad again highlighting the measure alongside other pieces of legislation related to hot-button social issues. ""Rauner made you pay for abortions in all nine months of pregnancy,"" Ives says in the ad. ""I voted against it — and so did every other Republican legislator."" The radio spot followed a recent TV commercial in which a series of actors mockingly thank Rauner for signing legislation advancing issues that rankle many social conservatives, from immigration to transgender rights. The television ad highlighted the abortion measure, too, with an actress in a pink pussyhat staring into the camera and thanking Rauner for ""making all Illinois families pay for my abortions."" The TV spot drew widespread condemnation from Republicans and Democrats alike, who decried it as bigoted and called for Ives to take it down. But the censure wasn’t universal, with conservative donor and Illinois businessman Richard Uihlein ponying up $2 million more for her campaign two days later. Uihlein gave more than $2.6 million to Rauner’s campaign in 2014. Ives has publicly stated her ads were aired to raise the profile of her campaign, even kicking off the new radio spot by saying, ""now that I have your attention."" Attention grab or not, however, her radio ad makes an incendiary claim about the issue that in many ways forms the cornerstone of her campaign. Illinois law prohibits abortions in the later months of a pregnancy except in very rare cases. So we wondered, how can it be possible that Rauner expanded taxpayer-funded abortion access in all nine months of pregnancy by signing the bill? A woman in Illinois can opt to legally terminate a pregnancy up until the point that her fetus would likely be able to survive outside the womb, according to state statute. Viability is determined by a woman’s physician and can vary from pregnancy to pregnancy, but usually occurs around 24 weeks of gestation, far off from the full nine months Ives cites. Federal law allows states to restrict abortions after viability, but states may not prohibit the procedure even then if a doctor determines a woman’s life or health is at risk. The law Rauner signed expands abortion access by providing coverage to any Medicaid recipient and state worker who opts for the procedure before viability. But a review of state statute shows it does nothing to supercede existing law concerning what constitutes a legal abortion. Democratic state Rep. Sara Feigenholtz, of Chicago, who sponsored the bill, confirmed in an emailed statement that it did not ""in any way alter the Illinois Abortion Law or any other legal limits to the practice of abortion in Illinois."" So we reached out to Ives’ campaign for an explanation of the candidate’s claim. Spokeswoman Kathleen Murphy acknowledged abortions were already legal after viability when a mother’s life or health is in danger. She also agreed that endangerment of the mother’s life at any point, along with cases of rape or incest in the earlier months of a pregnancy, were already covered by state and Medicaid plans. But she claimed that cases where a doctor had determined a mother’s health was at risk didn’t qualify for state coverage prior to the new law. ""The law already allows for abortion up to nine months with a doctor's note,"" she said. ""Now taxpayers will be funding that."" In fact, Illinois has been required to cover under Medicaid and state plans abortions necessary to protect a mother’s health since 1994 when a Cook County judge struck down a previous law limiting public funding to instances where her life was at risk. That case, along with one from the year prior that expanded state coverage to include rape and incest prior to viability, was brought by the ACLU of Illinois to extend coverage beyond life endangerment. ""You can’t pay for all other medical care necessary to preserve someone’s health but then leave abortion out,"" said Lorie Chaiten, director of ACLU Illinois’ Women’s and Reproductive Rights Project, in explaining that verdict. Ives’ statement belies another key fact: abortions occurring late in pregnancy are extremely rare. Nationally, only 1.3 percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. And figures from the Illinois Department of Public Health show that rate is even lower here. In 2016, half of one percent of all abortions, state-covered or otherwise, took place at or after that point. ""It just doesn’t happen that abortions take place that late in pregnancy unless there is some kind of extreme emergency,"" said Elizabeth Nash, a Guttmacher policy analyst. But extreme emergencies are not what Ives’ radio ad suggests. Nor are they what her campaign described when her spokeswoman elaborated in an email. ""What Rauner did is extend Medicaid coverage — taxpayer-funding — for all 9-months, abortion-on-demand,"" Murphy wrote. With such statements, the Ives campaign leaves the impression that the update to Illinois law now has women scurrying to the doctor near the end of a pregnancy for elective abortions on the taxpayer’s dime. Ives said, ""Rauner made you pay for abortions in all nine months of pregnancy."" Ives would have been on solid ground had she confined herself to criticizing Rauner for expanding Medicaid and state employee health plans to include coverage for elective abortions in the earlier months of pregnancy, just as many private insurance plans do. Instead, she took it further, suggesting his action opened up a new requirement for the state to pay for all abortions occurring in pregnancies closer to term as well. The state has been required for more than two decades to pay for an abortion whenever a doctor determines that a woman on Medicaid or state insurance needs the procedure to save her life or preserve her health, along with cases involving rape or incest. The new law Rauner signed did nothing to alter the legality of abortions in Illinois. Nor was it responsible for extending state coverage to include the few abortions permitted after the point when a fetus is considered able to survive outside the womb. Such instances were already included, rendering Ives’ claim that it was Rauner who cleared the way for the state to cover abortions in every single month of pregnancy inaccurate. We rate her statement False. Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check incorrectly stated that federal law requires states to permit abortions after viability in cases of rape or incest and that Illinois provided coverage for these later procedures. Illinois law only permits post-viability abortions in cases where a doctor determines a mother’s life or health is at risk. As stated in this fact-check, the bill Rauner signed did not alter state law concerning the legality of abortions in any way, nor did it expand coverage for late abortions.",[<zip object at 0x000002809748BE00>],/factchecks/2018/feb/12/jeanne-ives/campaign-ad-falsely-claims-rauner-made-taxpayers-f/

Rand Paul gets numbers right in speech on federal debt
","  As the House and Senate were rushing to head off a government shutdown during a late-night session on Feb. 8, Sen. Rand Paul,. R-Ky., was doing everything he could to slow the rush to passing a new spending bill. In a lengthy floor speech, Paul took aim at lawmakers who wring their hands about the rising debt but then vote for legislation that adds red ink. At one point in his speech, Paul said, ""George W. Bush doubled the debt from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. President Obama doubled the debt from $10 trillion to $20 trillion. Now we're on course to exceed $30 trillion in the next seven years or so."" We found that this assertion was largely accurate, but needs a few bits of context. Using the Treasury Department’s ""Debt to the Penny"" calculator, we were able to pinpoint the amount of debt created under each president. When Bush was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2001, the gross federal debt was $5.73 trillion. By the time he left office on Jan. 20, 2009, it was $10.63 trillion. So he’s on target with the numbers on Bush’s watch. As for Obama, the debt rose on his watch to $19.95 trillion. That’s not quite $20 trillion, but it’s awfully close. While Paul is basically right on the numbers, there is some nuance to add: • Paul is using one of two measures for debt, and it’s the larger of the two. He’s using gross federal debt, which includes debt not just held by the public, but also debt one part of the federal government owes to another part of the federal government. The debt figures would have been smaller if he’d only used publicly held debt, which is another commonly used measurement. • It’s an exaggeration to personalize the debt increase -- saying that Bush and Obama both ""doubled"" the debt. Other factors beyond presidential actions helped enable that doubling, including demographic factors, such as the aging of the Baby Boom; external events beyond the president’s control, including the Great Recession; and Congress’s actions in setting spending levels. Both presidents spent at least part of their terms with the opposing party controlling all or part of Congress. Officially, the CBO has not published this specific projection yet, but from what we can piece together, Paul has a point here, too. Even before the Republican-backed tax bill and the recent spending bill were enacted, the debt was set to soar. In its official projection from June 2017, the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan number-crunching agency -- estimated that the debt would rise as follows:   Year Gross federal debt at end of year 2018 $21.2 trillion 2019 $22.1 trillion 2020 $22.9 trillion 2021 $23.9 trillion 2022 $24.9 trillion 2023 $26.0 trillion 2024 $27.0 trillion 2025 $28.2 trillion 2026 $29.5 trillion 2027 $30.7 trillion If you consider ""the next seven years or so"" to be 2025, then the tax and spending bills passed in the past two months would have had to add an additional $1.8 trillion to the projected deficit to hit Paul’s $30 trillion debt figure by that year. Did they? The best estimates we can find say yes. For starters, the CBO released a letter after the tax bill was passed in December 2017 that said the debt held by the public would grow by a cumulative $1.65 trillion through 2025 as a result of the bill. (In this case, the CBO used publicly held debt, the smaller of the two debt measures.) So the tax bill alone would bring the debt level to at least $29.85 trillion by 2025. The spending bill appears to have put it over the top. A widely cited estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that the spending bill would cost an additional $320 billion to the debt through 2027, and almost $420 billion if you include interest. Even if you pare that number a bit in order to count only the years through 2025, it should be enough to break the $30 trillion barrier in seven years, as Paul predicted. As with the other part of the statement, we have a caveat to add. While Paul voted against the spending bill, he did vote in favor of the tax bill. If he wished, Paul could have saved $1.65 trillion in debt through 2025 by voting against the bigger of the two debt-busting bills. But he didn’t. Paul’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Paul said, ""George W. Bush doubled the debt from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. President Obama doubled the debt from $10 trillion to $20 trillion. Now we're on course to exceed $30 trillion in the next seven years or so."" Paul is essentially right on all of the numbers. That said, his comment was wrong to personalize the cause of the debt increases. While Bush and Obama played a role in the increase in the federal debt on their watch, so did other factors, including demographics, external events, and congressional actions driven by the other party. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979F9B00>],/factchecks/2018/feb/09/rand-paul/rand-paul-gets-numbers-right-speech-federal-debt/

Misleading NRSC ad paints Heidi Heitkamp as Donald Trump contrarian
","A North Dakota National Republican Senate Committee ad portrays Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., as a contrarian to President Donald Trump. ""North Dakota voted for President Trump,"" the voiceover says. ""But Sen. Heidi Heitkamp doesn’t care. She’s joined Washington liberals in their partisan obstruction and is taking orders from party boss Chuck Schumer, the architect of the Schumer Shutdown."" ""Heitkamp has voted against Trump 68 percent of time,"" the graphic reads. The statistic was shared during State of the Union and Super Bowl digital ad campaigns. Given North Dakota's Republican leanings, Heitkamp is a top GOP target. However, the party's top potential recruit, U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer, chose not to run, leaving state Sen. Tom Campbell the leading Republican challenger so far. We wondered whether Heitkamp had indeed opposed Trump’s agenda almost seven times out of 10. That depends on how you define opposition. The NRSC cited a FiveThirtyEight ""legislative voting analysis"" of Heitkamp’s votes. They pointed us to Heitkamp’s Trump Score on the news site, which tracks how many times each member of Congress votes with or against the president. FiveThirtyEight found that Heitkamp had voted with Trump 53.2 percent of the time and 46.8 percent of the time against him. The tally at the time the NRSC accessed the database (Jan. 26, 2018), was 53.33 percent with Trump, 46.7 percent against. That’s a much more moderate record than the ad suggests. When we asked how they arrived at a different number using the same source, the NRSC explained they had only looked at policy votes, excluding nomination votes. Heitkamp voted with Trump on 11 of 34 policy votes, and against Trump on 23 policy votes. That checks out, using the same simple arithmetic FiveThirtyEight used: 67.6, or 68, percent. But that leaves out 26 Cabinet and Supreme Court nomination-related votes. There were 21 votes with Trump, five against; That represents 80 percent agreement with Trump. FiveThirtyEight didn’t think so. ""Our goal is to track how often members vote in support of the president’s agenda, and we believe that including Cabinet-level and Supreme Court nominations is an important aspect of that,"" said Aaron Bycoffe, the article’s author. ""Excluding votes on presidential nominations must be explained and it is not,"" said Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. ""That is misleading, particularly when the source does not separate nominations from legislation and report separate scores. Most standard ‘presidential support’ analyses, including Congressional Quarterly’s studies, which date back to the 1960s, include significant nominations, like Supreme Court nominations and controversial Cabinet nominations."" Smith said that Heitkamp had supported the president’s position more than all but one other Democrat who has been in office throughout the term. Jeffrey Bumgarner, Criminal Justice and Political Science department head at the University of North Dakota, said that while the number sums up her legislative disagreement with Trump, favorable nomination votes should count as support for the president's agenda. That’s because ""the president has included his judicial and executive branch appointments among his accomplishments (so he sees these votes as important) and, in this hyper-partisan environment, votes for the opposing party's nominees are not a given; hence, it is particularly remarkable when a senator crosses party lines on a vote--even for nominees,"" Bumgarner said. Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist who specializes in legislative politics, said some voting studies ignore consensus votes, where 98 to 100 senators vote the same way, which may inflate presidential support scores. But that’s not the case here. Matthew Hitt, an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at Colorado State University, said it’s standard for advocacy groups to use a selected subset of key votes, but has a misleading effect here. ""Sen. Heitkamp voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch, a signature achievement of President Trump’s first year,"" Hitt said. ""So, excluding that vote from the scoring, as one example, does paint an incomplete and slightly unfairly negative view of her overall support for the key objectives of the Trump administration."" Heitkamp was one of three Democrats who voted to confirm Gorsuch. A North Dakota NRSC ad said, ""Heitkamp has voted against Trump 68 percent of the time."" That’s if you’re only looking at policy votes. When Cabinet and Supreme Court nominations are added to the mix, which is how both the source of the NRSC’s claim and traditional legislative trackers score presidential support, Hetikamp supports Trump about half the time. Experts described excluding nominations, like Neil Gorsuch’s, as misleading, as they play a key role in furthering Trump’s legislative agenda.

Attack on House Speaker Richard Corcoran, HB 7055 needs more context
","The state’s largest teachers’ union released a 30-second ad, saying that the House’s massive education is taking tax dollars and giving them to private schools with no oversight. The ad, posted on YouTube on Feb. 5 by the Florida Education Association, takes specific aim at House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O’Lakes, who has made Florida schools a top priority in 2018. The bill in question — HB 7055 — contains many education provisions and provides funding for the ""Hope Scholarship"" program, a top priority for Corcoran. The program would allow public school students who are bullied to transfer to other  private schools with discounted tuition. ""House Bill 7055 is another Tallahassee assault on our local public schools,"" the narrator says in a voiceover. ""Political insider Richard Corcoran has a plan to divert even more of our tax dollars to unaccountable private schools."" We wondered about this claim. Does Corcoran have a plan to ""divert tax dollars to unaccountable private schools?"" We found there is some truth to this claim, but getting there requires a lot more context. Florida Education Association communications director Sharon Nesvig said that the the Legislature has repeatedly increased and expanded a 2001 program known as the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship. HB 7055 adds a new ""voucher"" for a similar program, the Hope Scholarship. Here’s how those programs work: The Florida Tax Credit Scholarship was established in 2001 under Gov. Jeb Bush in order to give scholarships to poor children to attend private schools. The program provides dollar-for-dollar income tax credits for corporations that give money to organizations that give the scholarships. The tax credit cap for the 2017-18 fiscal year is almost $700 million and has increased every fiscal year. The Hope Scholarship is a voucher-like program that would be funded through motorists making voluntary contributions when they purchase cars. In return, car buyers would get a credit on the taxes they would normally have to pay on the purchases. Tax credit opponents, including the Florida Education Association, argue that the money used on these credits would have been state revenue if the Legislature had not diverted it. ""Those tax dollars would have gone into general revenue and been available to fund our neighborhood schools and pay for the books, curriculum, equipment and programs our students desperately need,"" Nesvig said. There is no way to know for certain that money would end up being spent on schools, but education experts agreed with the general idea. Kevin G. Welner, the Director of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado, said that the word ""diverted"" is ""just about the best word choice they could have used."" ""The tax payment is diverted from the state to a system that funds the private schools,"" he said. It’s important to note, though, that the programs create new revenue streams. They don’t literally move money from traditional sources of public school revenue. Nesvig pointed to an Orlando Sentinel months-long investigation about Florida private schools that receive these scholarships. It found that some schools ""hire teachers without college degrees, hold classes in aging strip malls and falsify fire-safety and health records.  Experts agreed there is a huge difference in oversight, transparency, and accountability between public schools to voucher-receiving private schools. The schools do not have to hire teachers with state certification or college degrees, and they don’t have to follow the state’s academic standards. In addition, local public schools and charter schools are evaluated every year and assigned labels based on tests and other evidence, but that accountability system does not apply to private schools that accept vouchers, however. But the word ""unaccountable"" does not address all of the nuances of the situation. Although experts said they are largely ineffective, private schools that receive vouchers do have to conform to accountability laws. ""If the ad included a footnote saying that the schools are ‘subject to weak and ineffective regulatory accountability,’ they might lose the punch of the statement, but it would be on more solid footing than flat out saying that the schools are ‘unaccountable.’"" Welner said. It’s also worth noting that there has been some legislation to fix this issue. In response to the investigation, Florida lawmakers took steps to increase accountability. SB 1756 would require private school to employ teachers who hold a bachelor's degree or higher from a ""regionally or nationally accredited college or university in the United States or from a recognized college or university in another country."" The FEA said that ""Richard Corcoran has a plan to divert even more of our tax dollars to unaccountable private schools."" This claim requires some explanation. The plan for diverting dollars refers to the Legislature’s decision to expand the state’s Tax Credit Scholarship Program and the Hope Scholarship proposal, which is included in HB 7055. The bill does create a new funding stream, but it doesn’t literally move money from traditional sources of public school revenue. And while there are some rules that govern private schools that receive vouchers, experts said there is a huge difference in oversight between those schools and public school. With everything considered, we rated this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809671BFC0>],/factchecks/2018/feb/09/florida-education-association/attack-house-speaker-richard-corcoran-hb-7055-need/

GOP Wisconsin House member on Sharpton visits to Obama White House
","President Donald Trump ignited an international firestorm when at a Jan. 11, 2018, Oval Office meeting with lawmakers on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, he reportedly said the U.S. should take in fewer immigrants from ""s---hole countries""  like Haiti, El Salvador and African countries -- and more immigrants from countries like Norway. Trump denied making the comment, tweeting ""the language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used."" While speaking Jan. 15, 2018, at a Ripon College event commemorating Martin Luther King Jr. Day, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) was asked to comment on controversial remarks that have been made by the president. Grothman was not specifically asked about, nor did he mention, Trump's controversial comments at the Oval Office meeting. Instead, as reported by the Ripon Commonwealth Press, Grothman said some of Trump’s tweets have been ""unhelpful,"" but he sees the president as someone trying to unite the country. ""I think he is doing what he can to try to bring people together,"" Grothman said. ""I mean, if you meet him, that is just obvious, and I think he has had to put up with — to a certain extent, it’s self-inflicted — more scrutiny than other presidents."" Grothman went on to compare reactions to Trump's actions with those of his predecessor, Barack Obama. ""The past president brought Al Sharpton into the White House something like 80 times,"" Grothman said. ""That was kind of stunning to me, but nobody ever made a big ruckus out of it."" To some, Sharpton is a lightning rod. But did he really visit the White House that many times? Grothman's evidence Bernadette Green, Grothman's director of communications, said that as of December 2014, Sharpton had made 72 official recorded visits to the White House. ""Keep in mind that not all visits were recorded, so that number could be higher and we have no way of knowing,"" Green said in an email. ""Congressman Grothman is correct in saying 'around 80' as he was estimating, and was not too far off the actual number (and again, these are only the visits recorded up until Dec. 2014)."" Green said Grothman wanted to note that the reason he has an issue with Sharpton visiting the White House is because of Sharpton’s 1990s activities, specifically the 1991 riot in Crown Heights in New York. Sharpton was widely criticized for remarks he made at a funeral that some said inflamed the situation that sparked the rioting. Sharpton also came under fire in 1995 for helping to sponsor protests during a landlord-tenant dispute that escalated and erupted into a fatal blaze at Jewish-owned Freddy’s Fashion Mart in Harlem. PolitiFact Wisconsin emailed a request for comment from Sharpton to his Harlem-based National Action Network but received no response. The Washington Post fact checker PolitiFact has not looked at this claim before, but our friends at the Washington Post have. In December 2014, former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani during an interview on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" said President Barack Obama ""has had Al Sharpton to the White House 80, 85 times"" and that made Sharpton a ""close adviser."" The Post checked White House visitor logs and reported that Sharpton's recorded visits through December 2014 stood at 72: One-on-one meetings: 5 (7 percent) Meetings with staff members or senior advisers, with more than one guest: 20 (27 percent) Events with more than 90 people: 16 (22 percent) Miscellaneous meetings or events, ranging from 3 to 700 guests: 31 (43 percent) The Post concluded that Giuliani picked the high end of the range from 80 to 85 visits that Sharpton made to the White House through 2014 and said ""it is correct that the figure Giuliani cites fits within the reported range."" But Giuliani earned one Pinocchio for the ""exaggeration"" of referring to Sharpton as an Obama White House ""close adviser."" The Post Fact Checker defines one Pinocchio as ""some shading of the facts. Selective telling of the truth. Some omissions and exaggerations, but no outright falsehoods."" PolitiFact Wisconsin visited the White House Visitor Log site to check the data for Sharpton's visits after December 2014, but the site features this note:  ""This is historical material 'frozen in time.' The website is no longer updated and links to external websites and some internal pages may not work."" Thomas Hayes, archivist at the Barack Obama Presidential Library, noted in an email that the records we needed are not currently available to the public through records requests. The Barack Obama Presidential records are administered in accordance with the requirements of the 1978 Presidential Records Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2209.  Under this law, Presidential records are not available to the public through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests until five years after the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) takes custody of the records or until NARA staff has completed processing and organization of an integral file segment of these Presidential records, whichever is earlier.  Neither of these terms have been met, therefore the Barack Obama Presidential records that you seek are not available at this time. According to the Memory Hole 2 website: ""the Obama White House kept adding its visitor logs to the same spreadsheet file, instead of releasing separate files covering certain time periods. That spreadsheet eventually grew gargantuan. When last updated at the end of 2016, it had become 1.1 gigabytes with 6 million rows. This is a big problem."" The site pointed out that ""the most popular spreadsheet software -- Excel, a part of Microsoft Office -- maxes out at just over a million rows. Word won't even try to open a file over 500 megs. And even if you had willing software, it's unlikely that a typical computer can handle the job. What good is an important historical record that almost no one can open?"" That said, the frozen White House site did have visitor logs posted through September 2016. PolitiFact Wisconsin was able to download the massive visitor log and, with an assist from data wiz Michael Andre come up with this tally of listed names: Alfred C.

Is a $705K salary ""below market"" for an NCAA athletic director?
","UNC-Chapel Hill athletics in recent years has reached historic heights and unprecedented lows. UNC last year won a national championship in men’s basketball – its most heralded program – and other teams have won a total of eight national titles since 2011. During the same period, the athletic department has been mired in a scandal that prompted a former federal prosecutor, a former North Carolina governor and the NCAA to investigate bogus classes and whether they were created to intentionally benefit athletes. So UNC faced some criticism in November when the Board of Governors granted its athletic director, Bubba Cunningham, an extra $200,000 a year over the next five years.  Board member Marty Kotis said he worried about the ""optics"" and timing of the deal. A month prior, the NCAA wrapped up its years-long investigation by saying that it ""could not conclude academic violations"" in the case and wouldn’t punish UNC in the bogus classes scandal. However, the leader of the NCAA Committee on Infractions said student-athletes ""likely benefited from the so-called paper courses"" and that it was ""more likely than not"" that UNC athletes received fraudulent credit in association with the courses at the heart of the case. The committee leader also said it was ""more likely than not"" that members of the UNC athletic department steered athletes to those courses in an effort to maintain their eligibility. Board member Tom Fetzer called a million-dollar pay increase ""ludicrous"" and said he was embarrassed by the vote because of the NCAA’s comments on classes that benefitted athletes. Haywood Cochrane, chairman of UNC-Chapel Hill’s Board of Trustees, defended the move by saying Cunningham’s old $705,853 base salary left him underpaid compared to other athletic directors at large universities. ""This was a reflection of the market, but he’s not at market,"" Cochrane said. ""He’s not even close."" Is that true? Is the going rate for an athletic director in one of the major athletic conferences more than $705,000 a year? PolitiFact reached out to members of the Board of Trustees to ask what they consider to be the market rate for athletic directors like Cunningham. Cochrane responded by email, but didn’t elaborate on his position. ""Bubba has done an exceptional job!"" he wrote. ""We do look at comps as part of our overall assessment and your research will, I believe, answer your question for you."" Another trustee, Dwight Stone, responded similarly. ""Why not do a little work and look up the top 25 Athletic Director compensations in the country and you can learn a lot,"" Stone said, adding: ""There is this thing called Google and you can really find most anything."" Well, Mr. Stone, the burden of proof in our fact-checking process falls on the person who made the claim. But we went to the interwebs and fired up that Google machine nonetheless. Here’s what we found. AD pay PolitiFact struggled to find a reliable, comprehensive list of salaries for athletic directors across the nation. However, we found data that offers a glimpse of it. The College and University Professional Association for Human Resources, known as CUPA-HR, gathers information on salaries in the academic field. Jacqueline Bichsel, the group’s director of research, provided us with a breakdown of median salaries for Chief Athletics Administrators during the 2016-2017 school year. The group’s findings aren’t comprehensive – there are a few schools that didn’t provide it with data – but most did. The median salary for athletics administrators at ACC schools is $549,215. These figures don’t take into account bonuses that ADs might receive if their schools achieve a certain level of academic and/or athletic success. The ACC median ranks lower than the median for each of the other ""power five"" conferences, which include the SEC, Big Ten, Big 12 and PAC 12. The median salaries for the conferences are as follows: N.C. State University is the most comparable school in the state. The base salary for Debbie Yow, N.C. State’s AD, is $690,000, according to Fred Demarest, the school’s senior associate athletics director. So Cunningham’s base salary was higher than the median of schools in the ACC, Big 12 and Pac 12, roughly the same as ADs in the SEC and lower than the median salary for Big Ten ADs. But some athletic directors are paid more because of their level of experience, the difficulty of the job or the reputation of the school’s programs. This is where experts said Cunningham’s situation is unique. Bubba’s tenure UNC hired Cunningham in 2011. He previously worked six years as the AD for the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma. There, GoHeels.com says Cunningham ""guided the Golden Hurricane through its initial move to Conference USA and spearheaded a $60 million athletics initiative. Tulsa won 34 league championships during his tenure, more than any other school in Conference USA, and the football program played in five bowl games in his final six years. He was honored as the 2008-09 FBS Central Region Athletics Director of the Year, an award presented by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics."" Since arriving at UNC, the Tar Heels have won nine national titles and made an additional 10 runner-up finishes. 2011: Men’s soccer. 2012: Women’s soccer. 2013: Women’s tennis and women’s lacrosse. 2015: Women’s tennis. 2016: Men’s tennis, as well as men’s and women’s lacrosse. 2017: Men’s basketball. Bubba’s hires None of those championships were won by coaches that Cunningham hired. Cunningham has hired four coaches during his tenure: men’s golf coach Andrew DiBitetto last July; wrestling coach Coleman Scott in 2015; track and field/cross country coach Harlis Meaders in 2012; and football coach Larry Fedora in 2011. With the exception of newcomer DiBitetto, who has yet to coach a full golf season, Cunningham’s hires have fared well. Given the amount of money it generates, the football team’s performance is likely the most important to Cunningham’s job security. So we’ll turn our attention there. The football team won three games and lost nine last year. But Fedora has an overall win percentage of .558. That’s slightly higher than his predecessor Butch Davis, who recorded a .549 win percentage (although some of those wins were retroactively voided by the NCAA). Fedora in 2015 took UNC to its first 11-win season since 1997. He was a Bear Bryant National Coach of the Year finalist in 2015 and was named National Coach of the Year by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Last summer, Cunningham signed Fedora to a contract extension through the 2022 season. Other accomplishments The university notes that, under Cunningham’s leadership, UNC launched an NCAA compliance review to be conducted by an outside firm and a master plan for UNC’s athletic facilities. UNC says ""a transformative array of athletics facilities projects -- including a new football practice facility, lacrosse/soccer stadium, field hockey stadium and track and field complex – are also underway and will be completed by the fall of 2018."" Cunningham’s work has led him to prominent positions. He currently serves as president of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics and sits on the board of LEAD1, an association representing the ADs from the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision schools. Cunningham is also on the verge of signing UNC to a new athletic apparel deal with Nike. UNC’s current deal with Nike, and its Jordan Brand subsidiary, expires in June and is worth about $36.85 million in uniforms, footwear, apparel and cash considerations. Nike’s recent deals with Texas and Ohio State are worth more than $250 million over the next 15 years. UNC’s contract ""will be a very good deal but not a blockbuster,"" like those schools’ deals, Cunningham said. What experts say To some degree, people (like houses) are worth what someone is willing to pay them. In that vein, UNC Chancellor Carol Folt said Cunningham is highly sought after. She said at that November trustees meeting that Cunningham had turned down a lucrative offer from the University of Florida because he wanted to stay at UNC. ""He has done some extraordinary things for which he is quite well-known nationally,"" she said. ""He’s viewed as probably one of the top five athletic directors in the country right now … So he’s on every short list."" Jay Bilas, an ESPN basketball analyst and attorney, said he considers a ""middle of the pack"" annual salary for elite athletic directors to be about $750,000. He thinks Cunningham’s new contract is ""a great deal"" for UNC. ""He is among the very best in his field. Thoughtful, smart, forward thinking, and he did a tremendous job shepherding UNC through the NCAA infractions process,"" Bilas said. ""As you know, he was not at UNC during the period at issue, but was at the helm throughout the entire adjudication of the matter. I couldn’t respect an AD more."" Tom McMillen, president and CEO of Lead1, said people should compare Cunningham with ADs at other elite schools. ""UNC’s compensation is on the high end of the ACC but not the high end of college sports,"" McMillen said. ""I think that [what Cochrane said] is an accurate statement."" Comparables Roger Denny is a partner at Spencer Fane, a St. Louis-based firm that specializes in researching salaries of athletic directors and coaches. Denny’s firm published its own set of AD salary data last July. He noted that ADs at other big schools are being paid substantially more than Cunningham. He offered a handful of relevant comparisons from a recent survey: Jim Sterk, Missouri: $850,000 Dan Guerrero, UCLA: more than $1 million Sheahon Zenger, Kansas: base salary of $700,000. Dan Radakovich, Clemson: $875,000. ""Bubba led them through perhaps the most complex NCAA case there’s ever been,"" Denny said. ""Just keeping the ship moving forward during that firestorm of issues is an accomplishment in and of itself."" Denny noted UNC’s progress on its athletics facilities master plan. The new football practice facility is long overdue and ""probably a lot of the reason Larry Fedora is still there,"" he said. Building new facilities for non-revenue sports ""is quite impressive."" ""I think he’s distinguished himself to a point that he should be considered among the top quarter of athletic directors,"" Denny said. ""So then, within the Power Five, that suggests that a salary even more than he received would be easily supportable."" Our ruling Cochrane, the chairman of UNC-Chapel Hill’s Board of Trustees, said Cunningham’s old $705,853 base salary was ""not at market … not even close."" It’s a stretch to say that Cunningham’s salary was ""not even close"" to what the market rate is for someone with his experience. However, experts agree that compared to his peers, Cunningham was well underpaid for his work at a university that’s achieved so much success despite facing adversity. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809710B4C0>],/factchecks/2018/feb/08/university-north-carolina/705k-below-market-rate-ncaa-athletic-director/

Donald Trump wrongly suggests British don't love their health care system
","As thousands marched in the streets of London recently to protest funding cuts to the British National Health Service, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize the idea of universal health care. ""The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!"" Trump’s Feb. 5 tweet came shortly after Nigel Farage, the former UK Independence Party leader, talked about the NHS march and universal health care on Fox & Friends, warning Americans it would be ""politically impossible"" to remove such a system once introduced. Trump thanked the network on Twitter for ""exposing the truth"" shortly after Farage’s appearance. We wondered how accurate Trump’s claim was that people joined the NHS march because the UK’s universal health care system ""is going broke and not working."" We looked at the origins of the march and recent polling statistics about British public opinion on the National Health Service, commonly called the NHS. We also looked at the current funding situation, since Trump’s claim suggests it’s losing money. We found that Trump’s tweet gives a misleading impression about how the British public feels about its health care system. University of North Carolina health policy professor and deputy director of the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, Thomas C. Ricketts, told PolitiFact that the NHS probably has higher public support than any other government program in the UK. Public support for the NHS being maintained in its current form remains high according to a poll by Ipsos; 77 percent of people support this, while 9 in 10 people think the founding principles of the NHS should still apply to services today. Two-thirds of adults are willing to pay more of their own taxes to pay for the NHS. In a poll by YouGov last year, 84 percent of people were in favor of the service continuing to be run by the public sector. Helen Howson, the director of the Bevan Commission, an independent think tank for health in Wales, is working to find ways to improve the system while maintaining the principles set out at its founding. ""The NHS is a service which was set up to ensure that no one would be disadvantaged on the basis of their ability to pay, and people are passionate about these principles,"" she said. The NHS march, officially named, ""NHS in crisis: Fix it now""  was organized by the People’s Assembly, an independent, national campaign against austerity and Health Campaigns Together, a coalition defending the NHS. This year marks 70 years of NHS existence in the U.K., but the health care system has gone through what has been described as the worst winter in its recent history. The lack of funding is often blamed on austerity measures put forth by the Conservative Party and there have been concerns raised over privatizing parts of the system. Trump’s comments regarding the demonstration received immediate response by British officials, such as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said people were marching because they love the NHS and hate what is being happening to it by the current party in power. Health minister Jeremy Hunt, who was largely blamed for the severe lack of winter funding, hit back at Trump’s remarks, writing on Twitter that not one of the marchers ""wants to live in a system where 28m people have no cover."" This is not to say that people don’t have concerns about the NHS. In a poll released last summer by the British Medical Association, more people are unhappy with the NHS than satisfied for the first time in the public poll run by British doctors. It showed that 70 percent of people think the health service is going in the wrong direction. The poll shows that 43 percent of respondents are dissatisfied with the service, which is double the number of dissatisfaction percentage in only two years. About 33 percent of respondents say they are satisfied. The poll also concluded that 82 percent of people are worried about the future of the NHS, 62 percent expect the NHS to get worse in the coming years and only 13 percent think that it will improve. The leading concerns of the respondents included a lack of funding, the possibility that the NHS may cease to be free at the point of use, increased waiting times and a lack of attention given to the service because of Brexit. Trump also claimed that Democrats are pushing a similar health care plan to the NHS in the United States. Democrats have devised plans ranging from a total-government ""Medicare for all,"" also known as a single-payer health system, to a more limited ""public option"" that pits individual government-run plans up against private insurance for people who weren’t able to find affordable coverage in Obamacare. The latter allows Americans to gain access to government insurance alongside private health care plans. The current version of Obamacare, more formally known as the Affordable Care Act, has little resemblance to the NHS, where the government owns most of the hospitals and clinics, and doctors and nurses are government employees. Trump said, ""The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!"" While the NHS has lost funding over the years, the march that took place was not in opposition to the service, but a call to increase funding and stop austerity cuts towards health and social care. The march resulted because people want universal health care to work better, not because they want it taken over by the private sector. We rate this Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280970B4300>],/factchecks/2018/feb/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-suggests-british-dont-love-th/

No law banned smoking in cars with children effective Jan. 30, 2018
","The days of mom puffing away on a cigarette in the car while her children are in the back seat are over, according to a misleading viral story on Facebook. ""Smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018,"" stated a Feb. 3 headline on Lovethispic.com, a blog that encourages users to share images. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat hoaxes online. We found that the story was misleading because no such federal law kicked in at the end of January. The blog said that the law applies to any private vehicle and that violators would face up to a $100 fine. It included a photo of a woman smoking in the driver’s seat while children sat in the backseat. The blog didn’t explain if it was a federal or state or local law -- as evident by comments posted by confused readers who asked what jurisdictions would fall under the new law. The broad statements in the blog could leave the false impression that it refers to a federal law. The story linked to a Feb. 1  Yahoo Lifestyle story and lifted many paragraphs from that article. The Yahoo story stated that on Jan. 30, the Alabama state House of Representatives passed a bill to ban smoking in vehicles with any riders under the age of 19. So that means the bill itself wasn’t enacted as a law by that date -- it still has additional legislative hurdles. However if it becomes law, Alabama would be the ninth state to do so since 2006. There is no federal law -- or proposed federal legislation -- prohibiting smoking in vehicles with children. Alabama is one of 12 states that are considering similar bills this session, said Liz Williams, project manager for Americans for Nonsmokers’ rights. The blog included a few sentences describing of the type of vehicles that it applies to, which closely mirrored the wording of an announcement in July 2015 by the government of the United Kingdom, which banned smoking in cars with children effective Oct. 1, 2015. The lovethispic blog appears to recycle a similar story from 2016, Snopes found. We emailed the lovethispic blog and did not hear a reply. The headline ""smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018"" is misleading because it could lead readers to believe that a national ban started in January.

No, majority of states did not ban Sharia law
","A story appearing on Facebook repeated talk of Donald Trump’s 2015 proposed ban on Muslim immigrants but went too far in including a claim that the majority of U.S. states have banned Sharia law. ""Just in: 45 states just banned Sharia law,"" said a Feb. 6 headline on viralusa.org. Similar fake stories have circulated for months on various websites proclaiming that many states, or Trump himself, banned Sharia law. Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, and financial dealings. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the majority of states have not imposed such a ban. While the headline is a hoax meant to drive page views, some of the quotes in the article related to Trump’s proposed ban are accurate. We have been tracking Trump’s promise ""for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims"" entering the U.S. and rated his efforts, which have been bogged down in litigation, Stalled. The viralusa.org story that followed the headline makes no mention of states banning Sharia law. Instead, the brief story focused on Trump’s effort to ban Muslims. The story repeated a quote by Trump about the Muslim ban: ""Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on,"" he said. The story on viralusa.org didn’t explain the setting when Trump made that quote: he said it at a rally in Mount Pleasant, S.C., on Dec. 7, 2015 pointing to a statement he made earlier that day. Viralusa.org then posted the response by U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. who said on CNN ""you know how you make American great again? Tell Donald Trump to go to hell."" The story also quoted a reply from Ben Carson: ""We do not discriminate on people based on religion"" -- again, a real quote from CNN. (Graham and Carson were among Trump’s rivals in the GOP primary at the time.) While the vast majority of states haven’t banned Sharia law, 11 states -- Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington -- enacted legislation regarding the application of foreign or religious law in state courts in recent years, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. These state laws generally ban the application of foreign laws if it violates a person’s fundamental rights such as freedom of religion or speech. Additionally, Texas adopted a law that requires the Texas Supreme Court to adopt rules and provide judicial instruction regarding the application of foreign laws in certain family law cases. Though most of the laws don’t expressly ban Sharia law, critics say that they could be viewed as anti-Muslim. In reality the practice of using foreign law in state courts is not uncommon and generally not controversial, experts told PolitiFact Florida in 2014. For example, parties in international contracts frequently agree to apply a specific foreign country’s law to govern their agreements. A headline said that ""45 states just banned Sharia law,"" but the story itself contained no information about any such state bans. While there have been some states that have enacted legislation to ban the use of foreign law, at least in some circumstances, it’s a gross exaggeration to say that the majority of states have banned Sharia law.

Travis Allen gets it wrong, again, on support for California's sanctuary state law
","It’s become a well-worn talking point for GOP gubernatorial candidate Travis Allen: ‘Californians overwhelmingly oppose’ sanctuary state policies. The problem? The claim is simply not backed up by the facts. We handed out a False rating when Allen made the assertion on Fox News on Jan. 2, 2018. We found four recent polls that contradicted Allen’s statement. They showed Californians generally favor cities having the ability to declare themselves sanctuaries. Two specifically found greater support than opposition for California’s sanctuary state law, which limits state and local law enforcement from cooperating with federal authorities on immigration holds, under some circumstances. Then Allen made similar claims during a Feb. 1, 2018 interview on Capital Public Radio. ""Californians are overwhelmingly against this concept of the illegal sanctuary state, which simply put is sheltering people in this state who are here illegally and committing crimes while they are here with taxpayer dollars. I got to tell you, you walk down the street and ask any Californian, nobody agrees with that idea."" One of the top issues in California, he added later in the interview, ""is this illegal sanctuary state, which I would tell you the overwhelming majority of Californians disagree with."" We examined his recent statements to see if they line up with our past False rating. ""I don't care which poll you look at""  Allen has pointed to a 2015 UC Berkeley survey to back up his assertion, correctly noting one response in that poll found 74 percent of respondents opposed sanctuary policies. But he continues to dismiss findings in more recent surveys that contradict his claim, including a 2017 poll by the same UC Berkeley group. On Jan. 11, 2018 during a talk at the Public Policy Institute of California, he said, ""I don't care which poll you look at, whether it’s a 2015 poll or a 2017 poll, Californians do not believe in sheltering people who are here in the state illegally that are committing crimes while they’re here with taxpayer dollars."" Allen's campaign spokeswoman has described the 2015 UC Berkeley poll as ""the most accurate and appropriate to use."" She has claimed the 2017 poll ""was biased"" and ""adds politics and inaccurate descriptions of sanctuary policies into the poll."" Some might take issue with how Allen characterized the law, particularly the idea that the state is sheltering people who are ""committing crimes."" Even so, 53 percent in the most recent survey on the topic, published in November 2017 by USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times, favored California’s sanctuary state legislation when asked ""Do you favor or oppose the new law that says California law enforcement personnel will not hand over immigrants in the country illegally to U.S. immigration agents, unless the person has committed a serious crime?"" Twenty-nine percent were opposed. That doesn’t fit with Allen’s claim ""nobody agrees with"" the policy or that Californians are ""overwhelmingly against"" it. Ignoring key context We also found Allen’s statements ignores some key context. Here’s more about what the law does and doesn’t do, as outlined by the Los Angeles Times in October 2017 when Gov. Brown signed the sanctuary state law: ""The new law will largely prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from using either personnel or funds to hold, question or share information about people with federal immigration agents unless those individuals have been convicted of one or more offenses from a list of 800 crimes outlined in a 2013 state law."" ""Federal immigration authorities will still be able to work with state corrections officials — a key concession Brown had demanded — and will be able to enter county jails to question immigrants."" Our ruling During a recent radio interview, Travis Allen twice repeated the unfounded claim Californians are ""overwhelmingly against"" the new sanctuary state law. He’s made this assertion numerous times in recent months despite four polls that show a majority, or in some cases a near-majority, of Californians support the sanctuary policies. A past claim on the topic earned Allen a False rating. On these latest statements, we again rated Allen’s claim False. UPDATE: After publication, the Public Policy Institute of California released a new survey, on Feb. 8, 2018, showing 65 percent of California adults, including 58 percent of likely voters, favored local governments making their own policies and taking action separate from the federal government to protect the legal rights of undocumented immigrants in the state. It found 83 percent of Democrats, 53 percent of Independents and 21 percent of Republicans were in favor. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Immigration, MS-13 and crime: the facts behind Donald Trump’s exaggerations
","President Donald Trump linked illegal immigration to the violence of the MS-13 gang, claiming ""open borders"" have caused the death of many people in the United States. During his State of the Union speech, Trump highlighted the 2016 killings of teenagers Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens in New York and the related murder charges against MS-13 members. ""These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and Nisa's murders,"" Trump said Jan. 30. ""Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes and our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied, alien minors. And wound up in Kayla and Nisa's high school."" The U.S. Justice Department did not specify in a 2017 press release on the indictments if the defendants charged for the murders of Cuevas and Mickens came to the United States illegally as unaccompanied minors. We asked the department to clarify, but it referred us to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which did not provide a response by deadline. PolitiFact decided to fact-check whether gang members have taken advantage of ""glaring loopholes"" and laws to come in as unaccompanied minors, as Trump claimed. The White House did not provide on-the-record information to back Trump’s claim. It’s unclear exactly how many gang members have come to the United States as unaccompanied minors, but federal authorities have identified a small number as suspected or confirmed gang members. Nevertheless, what Trump refers to as ""loopholes"" are actually specific protections for undocumented minors called for by law. Some of these minors are actually fleeing gang violence in their own countries. Finally, experts note that unaccompanied minors are vulnerable to gang recruitment after their arrival to the United States. Here’s a closer look at the complex issue. La Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s. The Justice Department said the name Mara Salvatrucha comes from the word ""mara,"" a term in El Salvador for gang, ""salva,"" short for ""Salvadoran,"" and ""trucha,"" a slang term for ""alert,"" ""look out,"" or ""cunning."" The 13 refers to ""M"" — the thirteenth letter of the alphabet, denoting allegiance to the prison gang Mexican Mafia. MS-13’s motto is ""kill, rape and control,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said. The Trump administration says there are more than 10,000 MS-13 gang members across 40 U.S. states and more than 30,000 worldwide. Experts have told us that the growth of MS-13 in the United States is related to draconian policies in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador that pushed many gang members out of Central America. In the United States, law enforcement officials have indicted MS-13 members for a wide range of crimes, including murders, attempted murders, assaults, obstruction of justice, arson, and conspiracy to distribute marijuana. Waves of unaccompanied minors, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, have come to the United States illegally in recent years fleeing gang violence and poverty. Southwest border apprehensions of unaccompanied minors peaked in 2014 at 68,541. Around 41,400 of them were apprehended in fiscal year 2017, a 31 percent decrease from fiscal year 2016, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Unaccompanied Alien Child is the legal term for an individual who does not have a lawful immigration status in the United States; is under 18 years old; and has no parent or legal guardian in the United States, or for whom no parent or legal guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody. Trump has previously claimed that ""loopholes"" prevent the deportation of unaccompanied minors. That’s Mostly False. The ""loopholes"" he has referred to are matters explicitly called for in the law. Unaccompanied minors from contiguous countries (Mexico and Canada) can be quickly returned to their countries; but unaccompanied minors from other countries are not immediately sent back, but rather placed in formal removal proceedings and can apply for asylum. Individuals can seek asylum if they have suffered persecution or fear they will suffer persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Regarding Trump’s ""glaring loopholes"" and gangs claim, we asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its agencies for data on unaccompanied minors who have sought asylum in the United States while belonging to MS-13 or other gangs at time of entry. None provided information. Immigration experts told us that while gang members can apply for asylum, it would be difficult for them to receive it. ""If the gang member persecuted others or committed a serious crime in the United States or his country of origin, he would likely be barred from asylum,"" said Fatma E. Marouf, a professor of law and director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Texas A&M University School of Law. ""Most of the asylum seekers we see are fleeing gangs or refused to join a gang. It is also very difficult for them to obtain asylum in the United States because they don't fit easily into one of the five grounds for asylum,"" Marouf said. According to June 2017 written testimony from U.S. Border Patrol Acting Chief Carla Provost, since fiscal year 2012 U.S. Border Patrol apprehended 159 unaccompanied alien children with confirmed or suspected gang affiliations. Of the 159 children, 56 were suspected or confirmed to be affiliated with MS-13, according to Provost. (Around 45,400 unaccompanied minors, on average, were apprehended per fiscal year from 2012 to 2017.) Provost’s testimony did not break down how many unaccompanied minors were confirmed to be gang members and how many were suspected. ""The language of ‘suspected’ is important because DHS’s internal enforcement, ICE, has alleged gang membership or affiliation against a number of Central American immigrants without substantiating these allegations at all,"" said Saba N. Ahmed, a clinical instructor in the Immigration and Human Rights Clinic at the University of the District of Columbia, David A. Clarke School of Law. ""In fact, in the very recent class action case of Saravia, arising out of Operation Matador activity in New York, a federal circuit judge ordered the government to substantiate these allegations, and they could not,"" Ahmed said. Conflating ""suspected"" and ""confirmed"" exaggerates the gang problem in the United States, said Sonja Wolf, a researcher with the Drug Policy Programme at the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE), a think tank in Mexico. ""Not all unaccompanied minors get involved in gangs, and not all gang members are undocumented immigrants but were often born in the United States,"" Wolf said. ICE has reported that operations targeting gang members have led to the arrests of individuals who came as unaccompanied minors. But it’s unclear if they arrived as gang members or joined gangs after coming to the United States. Experts on immigration, gangs and criminal networks, and law enforcement have said unaccompanied minors are clearly targets for MS-13 recruitment. Timothy D. Sini, then-Commissioner of the Suffolk County Police Department in New York (now the county’s district attorney), told a Senate committee in May 2017 that unaccompanied minors are vulnerable to recruitment because they are young, unaccompanied, adjusting to a new country, culture and language, and seek a sense of belonging. ""While the overwhelming majority of these children live law-abiding lives, (unaccompanied alien children) are undoubtedly a source of recruitment for MS-13,"" Sini said. Of a sampling of 156 active gang members in Suffolk County, Sini said 39 were unaccompanied minors. ""It is not entirely clear, however, the percentage of (unaccompanied alien children) who came into the United States as MS-13 gang members, were recruited while in federal custody or were preyed upon once they reached Suffolk,"" Sini said. In testimony to the same committee, Scott Michael Conley, a detective in the Chelsea Police Department in Massachusetts, said that while the majority of unaccompanied minors were fleeing violence, ""the smallest group of unaccompanied minors are ‘homeboys’ being sent by the gang to bolster the ranks of MS cliques operating in the United States."" Conley presented a recruitment scenario when gang members and minors who are not in gangs travel in the same group to the United States. Gang members gather information from non-gang members, such as where they lived and who their relatives are, and later use that information to recruit them. Those who refuse to join are subject to assaults or threats that their relatives will be killed, Conley said. MS-13 also exploits human smuggling organizations to bring unaccompanied minors to the United States, said Angel M. Melendez, a Special Agent in Charge for ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations in New York, during a House committee hearing in 2017. ""Illicit pathways go hand-in-hand with MS-13 increasing its membership,"" Melendez said. ""Once these children are smuggled into the United States, they become prime targets for enlistment into the gang."" Overall, several studies have found that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born individuals. Central American immigrant youth — both children and adults — are not only vulnerable to MS-13 threats, extortion, recruitment, but also are almost always their primary targets and victims, said Ahmed, from the University of the District of Columbia's David A. Clarke School of Law. ""DHS, Sessions, and Trump are trying to shift the focus of immigration enforcement to MS-13 in order to repeatedly drill in the message that immigrants are dangerous criminals,"" Ahmed said. But many gang members were born in the United States, and gangs form in conditions of marginality, which also exist in other countries, said Wolf, the researcher with CIDE in Mexico. ""There is no doubt that MS-13 has engaged in serious and heinous forms of violence, devastating families and communities. But the emphasis on immigrants as the source of the gang problem in the United States is misguided,"" said David C. Pyrooz, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Colorado Boulder, whose research includes gangs and criminal networks. While evidence suggests that immigrants are less likely to be in gangs than native-born youth, Pyrooz said, MS-13 is ""the perfect boogeyman, owing to their ethnicity, transnationality, and extreme violence."" ""The problem is that the constant callouts from the highest office in the land are giving MS-13 the notoriety that they could never achieve on their own accord,"" he said. Trump said many gang members have taken advantage of ""glaring loopholes and our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied, alien minors."" What Trump in the past has referred to as ""loopholes"" are requirements explicitly called for in the law. It’s also uncertain how many gang members have come to the United States as unaccompanied minors, but some law enforcement officials said some have. Experts note unaccompanied minors are vulnerable to recruitment after their arrival to the United States. In many cases, these minors are the victims of the gangs rather than perpetrators of crime.

Fact-checking statistics about Puerto Rico’s storm recovery
","Florida Sen. Bill Nelson is calling on the federal government to help Puerto Rico address the fallout from Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm that hit the island more than four months ago. Nelson, a Democrat seeking re-election this year, and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Feb. 1, encouraging federal justice officials to ""engage with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to best determine how federal law enforcement can assist the territory in these trying times."" The letter comes in the middle of reports of increased crime in Puerto Rico, which Nelson emphasized in a tweet accompanying news reports about the letter. ""Violent crime in Puerto Rico is on the rise as nearly one-third of the island remains without power,"" Nelson tweeted Feb. 2. Violent crime in Puerto Rico is on the rise as nearly 1/3 of the island remains without power. Sen. Rubio and I have asked DOJ to send any additional law enforcement resources necessary to help protect the people of Puerto Rico as they continue to recover. https://t.co/NRTRHVJgFH We wondered if Nelson’s statistics about Puerto Rico’s storm recovery were accurate. Let’s take a look. Nelson’s communication director Ryan Brown said the claim was in reference to recent news reports about an uptick in killings in January 2018. ""If you look at Nelson and Rubio’s letter, they clearly discuss the murder rate when discussing the increase in violent crime,"" he said. ""But they also clearly cite recent media reports."" Take for example the Associated Press article from Feb. 1.  ""One of Puerto Rico’s deadliest months in recent years has closed, with 78 killings reported in January as the U.S. territory struggles with a surge in violent crime and growing discontent among thousands of police officers,"" it reads.  That's almost a 35 percent increase from the previous year at the same time. There were 58 recorded killings in January 2017, according to statistics from Gobierno de Puerto Rico Policia. In addition, the AP reported that Puerto Rico normally sees an average of 56 homicides a month in the last two years. The AP reported that the uptick in killings came after increased dissatisfaction among thousands of police officers. In late December, police officers began calling in sick after the government fell behind on repaying millions of dollars worth of overtime  following Hurricanes Irma and Maria.   Nelson has a point about a recent uptick in killings, but Nelson said ""violent crime,"" which includes other crimes such as sexual assault, robberies and aggravated assault.  The most recent data for violent crime we could find was from Gobierno de Puerto Rico Policia. The report compared the month of January 2017 to the month of January 2018 and showed that violent crime dropped 12 percent, from 716 incidents in January 2017, to 630 incidents in January of 2018. But, comparing violent crime from one point in 2017 to the same point in 2018 is not an apple-to-apples comparison, experts said. Here's why: Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans fled the island after Hurricane Maria. It's hard to say exactly how many Puerto Ricans have left. University of Florida economists estimate the post-Maria moves to Florida are around 50,000 as of Jan. 6, according to an Orlando Sentinel article. Secondly, criminologists and experts familiar with the situation in Puerto Rico said it’s possible that the number of recently reported violent crimes (outside of homicides and murders), might be an undercount. ""Homicides are reliably measured, but the measurement of other violent crimes depends on reports by the victim or someone else to the police,"" said Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri - St. Louis. Part of the reason it’s difficult to track violent crime outside of murders, has to do with the lack of power and resources on the island. Like Nelson accurately said, nearly one-third of the island remains without power. On Feb. 2, the acting executive director of the Electric Power Authority Justo L. González Torres announced that a little more than one million or 70.92 percent electric customers in Puerto Rico have power. That leaves about 450,000 customers (roughly one-third) without power.
  Nelson said that ""violent crime in Puerto Rico is on the rise as nearly one-third of the island remains without power."" Nelson is accurately citing the percentage of Puerto Rico power customers still without power, but his claim about violent crime requires some context. Nelson is referring to a recent uptick in killings in January of this year, not overall violent crime.   The most recent estimate we could find shows that violent crime has actually dropped 12 percent in January compared with same point last year. Still, that doesn’t mean Nelson is wrong. Experts said the uptick in killings is significant, and that the crisis in Puerto Rico has more than likely reduced crime reporting by victims and perhaps also the recording of crime reports by the police, so the official statistics might be undercounting the number of violent crime incidents. With everything considered, we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973240C0>],/factchecks/2018/feb/07/bill-nelson/fact-checking-statistics-about-puerto-ricos-storm-/

No, Jaguars NFL team didn't declare bankruptcy after players took a knee
","Taking a knee in protest during the national anthem has led the Jacksonville Jaguars NFL team to bankruptcy, a fake viral post on Facebook said. ""First NFL team declares bankruptcy over kneeling thugs,"" said a Feb. 2 headline on TopBuzz, an open platform where anyone can post articles and videos. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that there is no evidence that the Jaguars plan to file for bankruptcy as a result of players taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality or injustice against African-Americans. The fact-checking website Snopes found that the same story was posted by Patriot Post, a satirical website, on Dec. 3. The article has since been posted by many other websites including Defense USA, Santa Christmas and Policetask. The Feb. 2 story said that ""last week"" 31 of 42 men on the Jaguars took a knee during the national anthem. (The Jaguars’ schedule shows their last game was Jan. 21, so technically they didn’t play the week before Feb. 2.) The players angered ""every God-fearing, country-loving American who has either had the honor to serve or know someone who did. They might as well have wiped their proverbial asses with the American flag,"" the story said. The story said that the Jaguars were ""quietly maneuvering behind the scenes to file a Chapter 11 reorganization of debt bankruptcy in the 3rd District Court of Atlanta next week."" We found no such court in Atlanta, and we found there is a bankruptcy court much closer to home: the Florida Middle Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville. We searched news reports and found nothing about the Jaguars moving toward bankruptcy. Forbes valued the Jaguars at about $2 billion, in 25th place, in it’s 2017 ranking of the value of NFL teams. The controversy about football players’ silent protests began in 2016, when then-NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick initially sat, and later switched to taking a knee, during the pre-game anthem to protest racial discrimination, especially at the hands of police. Those protests became even more politicized after President Donald Trump tweeted Sept. 23, 2017 that any such players who don’t stand during the national anthem should be fired. The next day, dozens of NFL players nationwide took a knee in protest, including some Jaguars players during their game in London. The Jaguars drew particular attention because their owner, Shahid Khan, a Pakistan-born Muslim and only nonwhite NFL owner, publicly showed his support for the protests. Khan joined his team on the field and locked arms to show solidarity during the game. ""We have a lot of work to do and we can do it, but the comments made by the president make it harder,"" Khan said in a statement. ""That's why it was important for us, and personally for me, to show the world that even if we may differ at times, we can and should be united in the effort to become better as people and a nation."" Khan had donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration but has also criticized Trump’s attempt to ban immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries. We emailed the Jaguars’ public relations office and did not get a reply. The protests by NFL players have fueled multiple fake news stories including that a flight crew took a knee and stranded the New Orleans Saints on an airport runway, and that the NFL fined Pittsburgh Steelers $1 million each for skipping national anthem and that Fox Sports cancelled NFL broadcasts. All of those stories rated Pants on Fire, and in this case the claim that the Jaguars declared bankruptcy over ""kneeling thugs"" is also made up.

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim about 'treason'
","President Donald Trump’s visit to the Sheffer Corp. near Cincinnati was billed as a chance to discuss the recently enacted tax law. While Trump did discuss the tax law, most coverage of the speech led with a digression in which Trump accused Democrats of treason. It came as Trump was touting a drop in African-American unemployment, as he had done on several occasions previously. He knocked Democrats for their failure to applaud when he mentioned this during his State of the Union address. ""You’re up there, you’ve got half the room going totally crazy, wild — they loved everything, they want to do something great for our country,"" Trump said on Feb. 5. ""And you have the other side, even on positive news — really positive news, like that — they were like death and un-American.  Un-American. Somebody said, ‘treasonous.’ I mean, yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not? I mean, they certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much."" There’s actually a very good reason why not: The Constitution. ""It was a profoundly stupid and ignorant statement,"" said Carlton F.W. Larson, a law professor at the the University of California-Davis who is writing a book about treason and the American Revolution. ""There are occasional hard cases where it is debatable whether something constitutes treason. But this is not one of them."" The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told NBC News the following day that Trump had been ""tongue in cheek,"" and in the daily White House briefing, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, ""The president was clearly joking with his comments."" Still, we’ve decided to fact-check Trump’s statement for two reasons. First, the long lead-up to the ""treason"" comment came off as entirely serious, and while the reference to ""treason"" itself was uttered in a flip manner, it fell short of being clearly a joke. (Watch the video and judge for yourself here.) Second, the Constitution is very clear when it comes to the definition of treason. The Constitution -- which mentions very few crimes specifically -- defines treason this way: ""Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court. ""The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted."" This is a narrow definition. On the most basic level, treason has to occur in wartime, or during an armed rebellion against the government. With the possible exception of an American ""levying war"" against U.S. troops in a place like Afghanistan, ""the biggest-picture takeaway is that there is no treason occurring on any side now,"" said Jed Shugerman, a legal historian at Fordham Law School. Indeed, Shugerman has previously cautioned those on the left who would label members of Trump’s circle as treasonous for allegedly cooperating with Russia during the 2016 election. The most fundamental reason why the word ""treason"" would be inaccurate in such cases, Shugerman and others argue, is that the United States is not at war with Russia. ""We are not at war with Russia under any fair understanding of the word,"" he said. Shugerman added that even a notion like ""cyberwar"" with Russia is a metaphor for war rather than an actual deadly conflict, unless that cyberwar were to escalate to, say, hacking into nuclear power plants with the intent of exploding them. Calling U.S.-Russia relations ""war"" is no more accurate than calling the Super Bowl ""war"" just because the players talk about battle plans and how to attack their enemy, he said. Because the definition of treason is so narrow, charges have only been brought a few dozen times in the country’s history, and none, apparently, since the end of World War II, which -- perhaps not coincidentally -- was the last officially declared war. A rendering of the Whiskey Rebellion. (Wikimedia commons) Charges of treason have been prosecuted in relation to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794; against Aaron Burr (who was acquitted); Thomas W. Dorr, who set up a parallel government of Rhode Island in the 1840s (he was convicted but later pardoned); and a number of cases related to slavery and the Civil War. There was a flurry of treason cases during and after World War II, including the poet Ezra Pound for pro-Axis propaganda (he was hospitalized for insanity) and the broadcast propagandists known as Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally (both of whom served prison time). The rarity of treason charges can also be seen in the examples of actions that never drew a treason charge. When Eugene V. Debs was prosecuted for encouraging draft avoidance during World War I, he was charged with sedition, not treason. During the Cold War, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of espionage charges, not treason. (Espionage does not have to occur during wartime, or even against an enemy.) And Jane Fonda was never charged with treason for allegations of anti-Americanism when she consorted with the North Vietnamese during the Vietnam War. Legal scholars we contacted unanimously said Trump’s words were ill-conceived. ""It’s not only legally frivolous and offensive to suggest that an act of political protest as simple as not clapping isn’t treason, but it’s wholly ignorant of why the Constitution has a treason clause in the first place — to prevent what was a common practice in England at the time, in which the government labeled its political opponents as ‘traitors’ and used that as an excuse to throw them in jail,"" said Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas. ""Being rude and partisan does not come close to the constitutional definition of treason,"" agreed Robert F. Turner, a fellow at the Center for National Security Law at the University of Virginia. Michael C.H. McDaniel, the director of Homeland Security Law Programs at Western Michigan University, said there could hardly be a clearer example of protected political speech than the one Trump decided to label treasonous. ""Expressing partisan disagreement with the president is not treason -- in fact, it is political speech, the core speech to which the First Amendment is protecting from the Federal government,"" he said. Trump said that at the State of the Union address, Democrats, ""even on positive news … were like death and un-American. Un-American. Somebody said, ‘treasonous.’ I mean, yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not?"" There’s a good reason why not: Declining to applaud the president doesn’t come anywhere near meeting the constitutionally defined threshold of treason, which in any case can’t occur except in wartime. Rather, legal experts agree that it is a clear case of constitutionally protected free speech.

Fake Trump tweet about ‘Dow Joans’ dropping called for Trump to be shot from a cannon into sun
","As the Dow Jones plunged Feb. 5, not long after President Donald Trump boasted about the stock market gains, a fake Trump tweet surfaced in which he vowed that such a drop in the ""Dow Joans"" should result in the president being shot out of a cannon into the sun. Though it was a hoax, that didn’t stop the Twitterverse from going nuts over it. At 4:38 p.m. Feb. 15, Shaun Usher, who lives in Manchester, England and author of the Letters of Note website, wrote on Twitter: ""There’s *always* a tweet,"" and then linked to a supposed Trump tweet from Feb. 15, 2015: ""If the Dow Joans ever falls more than 1000 ‘points’ in a Single Day the sitting president should be 'loaded' into a very big cannon and Shot into the sun at TREMENDOUS SPEED! No excuses!"" There's *always* a tweet pic.twitter.com/dmrmzoRwP1 The tweet took off, and within 19 hours drew more than 22,000 retweets and 47,000 likes. Minutes later, Usher followed up by making it clear the tweet was a hoax: ""Sweet mother of god. Not for one second did I think people would believe that to be genuine."" ""omg it's everywhere. What have I done."" ""siri can i be arrested for making a fake tweet."" Some users on Twitter called on Usher to delete the tweet. He replied: ""Many people asking why I haven't taken it down. Literally within minutes of me posting it, it had legs. It was everywhere within about 10mins. I had lost control of it in an instant. Deleting mine--its place of birth--felt wrong & maybe more dangerous?"" Many in the Twitterverse seemed to realize it was a hoax and enjoyed the joke: ""You just gained a follower. Me. Thanks for the laugh."" ""Does this mean he's NOT getting shot out of a cannon??"" tweeted another with a sad face emoji.   ""We will build a sun cannon, and we will have the sun people pay for it,"" one tweeted, a reference to Trump’s plan to build a wall at the border of Mexico and make Mexico pay for it. Some in the twitterverse adopted an investigative tone and noted that the alleged Trump tweet had more than 140 characters, which wasn’t possible in 2015. Another took a scientific approach: ""Important question: would one want said president to make it to the sun, or simply impart the amount of inertia required to get something of their mass to the sun? One is much more complex the other and could create many jobs,"" linking to a diagram and math formula for shooting Trump to the sun. Some on Twitter appeared to fall for the hoax: ""OMG, did the dumb SOB really spell it ‘Joans’?"" ""Is this real?"" ""Oops. I fell for it."" It wasn’t a surprise that someone poked fun at Trump for the stock market drop after Trump had repeatedly touted gains in the stock market. On Jan. 5, Trump tweeted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average ""jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks, Record fastest 1000 point move in history."" We rated that statement True, though no president can take full credit for the economy. Trump made a comment about stock market records in Nashville days later and again Jan. 26 in a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Usher has been critical of Trump in the past. Hours before Usher posted the fake tweet, he bashed Trump over his criticism of the UK health care system. In January, Usher called Trump the ""dumbest sack of meat"" in response to his comments about climate change. We attempted to reach Usher but did not hear back. The White House declined to comment.   We rate this fake tweet Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B18800>],/factchecks/2018/feb/06/tweets/fake-trump-tweet-about-dow-joans-dropping-called-t/
