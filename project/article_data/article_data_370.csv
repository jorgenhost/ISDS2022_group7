Fact-checking Joy Behar on mass shootings and the assault weapons ban
","After a Colorado gunman killed 10 people in what was the second mass shooting in a week, Democrats and gun control advocates renewed calls for a nationwide ban on assault weapons, like the federal law that was in effect from 1994 until 2004. Joy Behar, co-host of ABC’s ""The View,"" joined the chorus March 23. ""In 2004, George W. Bush lifted the ban on those rifles, and since then, the number of massacres has increased 183%,"" Behar said, after rattling off a list of high-profile mass shootings from recent years where the perpetrators used AR-15 style weapons. ""During the ban, there were 12 incidents,"" Behar continued. ""Since he lifted the ban, there were 34 incidents. Anybody, or a right-minded person, can see that that gun has to go."" PolitiFact has fact-checked similar claims assessing the impact of the 1994 assault-weapons ban several times following other mass shootings. We wondered if Behar’s statement was true. The first part of her statement was not. The 1994 ban enacted under former President Bill Clinton expired because of a sunset provision written into the law, not because Bush decided to axe it, as Behar claimed. News reports from the time said he was on board with renewing it. But on the second part, we found that Behar’s numbers aligned with at least one researcher’s findings on mass shootings during and after the ban. And experts who study mass shootings said her broader point — that the number of high-fatality incidents has increased since the ban went away — is largely accurate, although proving cause-and-effect is difficult. The 1994 law, part of an anticrime package authored by then-Sen. Joe Biden, banned the ""manufacture, transfer and possession"" of certain semiautomatic firearms classified as ""assault weapons"" as well as certain high-capacity ammunition magazines of more than 10 rounds.  Clinton signed the law, and Bush was in office when it expired. But Bush didn’t scrap the law.  ""It had a sunset provision and would end after 10 years without renewal or reinstatement,"" said Adam Lankford, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Alabama. News accounts from the time indicated that as Congress considered extending the ban beyond 2004, Bush said he would support doing so. ""There were attempts by members of Congress to reauthorize it, including Dianne Feinstein, and they all failed,"" said Jaclyn Schildkraut, associate professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York at Oswego. ""But it was not George Bush who lifted it."" There’s no universally accepted definition for mass shootings or ""massacres,"" as Behar described the incidents in question. Asked where Behar got her numbers, an ABC spokesperson pointed to a 2018 report in the Washington Post. The report documented the findings that Louis Klarevas, research professor at Teachers College, Columbia University, outlined in his 2016 book, ""Rampage Nation."" Klarevas examined incidents over three decades — before, during and after the 1994 ban — in which six or more people were shot and killed, not including the perpetrators.  His findings shook out this way: The decade before the ban, 1984-94: 19 incidents. The decade during the ban, 1994-04: 12 incidents. The decade after the ban sunset, 2004-14: 34 incidents. That shows a 183% increase from the decade during the ban to the decade after it ended. Klarevas told PolitiFact that Behar’s claim was largely accurate, save for the blame she wrongly heaped on Bush — and one other caveat. The research Behar cited ""does not account for all high-fatality mass shootings since the federal ban expired,"" Klarevas said. It accounts for only the first 10 years after the ban. ""Behar actually understated the raw numbers, because she said 34 incidents ‘since’ the ban was ended,"" Lankford said. Klarevas said that since the ban expired, he has counted 62 incidents in which six or more people were shot and killed, including the recent shootings in Atlanta and Boulder, Colo.  ""To put this in perspective, during the decade of the federal assault weapons ban, there were 12 high-fatality mass shootings. That comes out to an average of 1.2 incidents per year,"" Klarevas said. ""In the 16.5 years since the expiration of the federal ban, there have been 62 high-fatality mass shootings. That comes out to an average of 3.8 incidents per year."" Between the ban’s expiration and the end of 2019, 32% of high-fatality mass shootings Klarevas recorded involved firearms classified as assault weapons, and 82% involved large-capacity magazines, he said. Other research backs Behar’s broader point that mass shootings have gone up since the ban ended. Not all mass shootings are carried out with the style of weapons that were banned.  Schildkraut’s research follows a different definition of mass shootings that counts targeted, public shootings in which ""multiple"" victims are injured or killed within 24 hours. By her definition, which doesn’t count shootings related to gang violence or terroristic activity, there were 13 mass shootings involving an assault weapon during the ban, and 27 in the decade after. ""We used a different definition of public mass shootings, but our numbers are similar,"" she said.  Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, who defines mass shootings as incidents where four or more victims are publicly killed, told the Washington Post that his numbers show ""there has been an increase in both the incidence and severity of mass public shootings (on a per capita basis) since the latter part of the 2000s."" Other recent research came from Christopher Koper, a George Mason University professor who wrote a 2004 Justice Department study that gave fuel to both sides of the gun control debate.  In a 2020 report, Koper said the ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines ""had exemptions and loopholes that limited its short-term effects, but its expiration in 2004 was followed by an increase in the use of these weapons in mass shootings and other crimes."" Research Lankford co-authored found that attackers’ increased use of semi-automatic rifles and assault weapons is part of the reason why the U.S. has had more high-fatality shootings over time. Another reason appears to be ""a change in motives"" that has more recent mass shooters seeking to kill large numbers of people for fame and attention, Lankford said.  In previous fact-checks, experts cautioned that it's difficult to directly tie increases in mass shootings to the expiration of the 2004 ban.  Klarevas, for his part, argued that the data are strong enough to suggest a causal relationship. A 2019 study that he co-authored, which focused on large-capacity magazines, ""suggested that bans on large-capacity magazines were effective at reducing mass shooting violence,"" he said. Behar said, ""In 2004, George W. Bush lifted the ban on those (AR-15 type) rifles, and since then, the number of massacres has increased 183%. During the ban, there were 12 incidents. Since he lifted the ban, there were 34 incidents."" The ban expired because of a sunset provision in the law, not because of Bush.  The numbers in Behar’s claim aligned with — and even understated — one researcher’s findings on the number of mass shootings that occurred during and after the 1994-to-2004 ban. Other research has similarly identified increases in such incidents since the ban ended, though the exact numbers vary partly due to how ""mass shooting"" is defined.   We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2021/mar/25/joy-behar/fact-checking-joy-behar-mass-shootings-and-assault/

No, Gates didn’t say 80% getting Moderna vaccine had significant side effects
","No, Bill Gates, one of the world’s leading proponents of COVID-19 vaccinations, did not say that 80% of the people who took the Moderna vaccine suffered significant side effects. Nevertheless, this claim was widely shared on Facebook: ""80% of People Taking The #Maderna Vaccine Had Significant Side-Effectives Via #BillGates."" The post, which relies on a misleading video clip from comedian and podcast host Joe Rogan, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s not uncommon for some people receiving the two-dose Moderna regimen to report pain in the arm that received the shot, or feeling tired or sick for a day or so, particularly after the second dose. But Gates did not say that 80% of people receiving the Moderna vaccine experience significant side effects. And reports of ""severe adverse events"" associated with the Moderna vaccine are extremely rare. The Facebook post includes video from a Rogan podcast in which Rogan recalls that Alex Jones, who runs a website that has published fake news and conspiracy theories, told him on a previous podcast that ""80% of the people that took the Moderna vaccine had significant side effects, particularly after the second dose.""  Rogan says that after he received pushback about Jones’ claim, ""I played the Bill Gates clip where Bill Gates is being interviewed by CBS and he says it himself.""  But Gates didn’t say that in the excerpt that Rogan played. In fact, he didn’t say it at any point in the CBS interview. Here’s that portion of CBS anchor Norah O’Donnell’s interview with Gates, which was done in July. O’Donnell: ""You mentioned side effects. The side effects for the Moderna vaccine sound concerning. We looked. After the second dose, at least 80% of participants experienced a systemic side effect, ranging from severe chills to fevers. So, are these vaccines safe?"" Gates: ""Well, the FDA, not being pressured, will look hard at that. The FDA is the gold standard of regulators and their current guidance on this, if they stick with that, is very, very appropriate. The side effects were not super-severe; that is, it didn’t cause permanent health problems. Moderna did have to go with a fairly high dose to get the antibodies. Some of the other vaccines are able to go with lower doses to get responses that are pretty high, including the"" Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines. … O’Donnell: ""But everybody with a high dose had a side effect.""            Gates: ""Yeah, but some of that is not dramatic, where it’s just super-painful. But, yes, we need to make sure there’s not               severe side effects. The FDA, I think, will do a good job of that, despite the pressure."" The post is also misleading in that its video includes two other misleading clips. As Gates is heard speaking in the CBS interview, clips roll showing two women. No audio is played with those clips and no other description of them is given. One shows a Tennessee nurse who became dizzy and was assisted to the ground after getting the Pfizer vaccine. She recovered and later said that she regularly feels dizzy after experiencing any kind of pain, even after stubbing a toe. The other clip is of an Indiana woman seated in a hospital bed shaking. She had claimed in viral videos in January that she suffered from uncontrollable shaking after taking the first round of the Moderna vaccine. Doctors at a neuroscience hospital told the woman her problem was likely stress-related, her fiance told an Indiana newspaper. So, where might the 80% figure claimed in the post have originated? In July, about a week before Gates’ CBS interview, the New England Journal of Medicine published a preliminary report on a trial involving 45 healthy adults who were given two doses of the Moderna vaccine, 28 days apart. They were divided into three groups of 15, with each group receiving a different dose level. In an article about that report, Wired magazine said: ""By the time they’d had two doses, every single one was showing signs of headaches, chills, or fatigue, and for at least 80%, this could have been enough to interfere with their normal activities."" Moderna later submitted data from a large trial to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. A December FDA report said that out of 15,184 people who received the vaccine, 82 had a serious adverse event, such as death, heart attack or pneumonia — fewer than 0.5%.  That was the same level for the placebo group. There was no indication the vaccine caused any of the serious events. The most commonly reported side effects of the Moderna vaccine, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, swollen lymph nodes in the same arm as the injection, nausea and vomiting, and fever, according to the FDA. More people experienced those side effects after the second dose. There is a remote chance that the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction, the FDA says. A Facebook post claimed: ""80% of people taking the Moderna vaccine had significant side effects, via Bill Gates."" Gates was asked in July about 80% of the people in an early trial of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine reporting ""systemic"" side effects such as severe chills and fevers. He did not say that 80% of people who got that vaccine experienced significant side effects. An FDA report in December said 0.5% of 15,184 people who took the Moderna vaccine experienced a ""severe adverse event."" That was the same level for the placebo group. There was no indication the vaccine caused any of the serious events. We rate the post False.",/factchecks/2021/mar/25/facebook-posts/no-gates-didnt-say-80-getting-moderna-vaccine-had-/

Border crossings are up, but not because Biden stopped the wall or deportations
","A North Carolina congressman says the number of crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border has doubled and that President Biden’s policies are to blame. Republican Richard Hudson spoke about immigration with Fox News in a segment posted online March 15. ""The reason we’re having this Biden border surge is because he’s reversed these policies, as you say. He stopped building the wall. He put a halt on deportations and he brought back catch and release,"" he said.  He later tweeted those same talking points. ""Democrats are trying to shift blame but make no mistake - this is the #BidenBorderCrisis. The facts back it up: illegal border crossings are up 173% from 1 year ago and 28% since January when President Biden stopped the wall & deportations and started catch & release,"" he said. While Hudson’s stats aren’t exactly right, he has a point about illegal border crossing numbers increasing significantly since last year and even since January. As for what’s causing the situation at the border, experts say his description is off. Border crossing numbers are available at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s website.  When the webpage opens, a chart will appear showing data that combines two types of encounters: those recorded by Border Patrol, and those recorded by the Office of Field Operations. What’s the difference? The field office deals with people who showed up at an official port of entry in an attempt to legally enter and were turned away. Meanwhile, Border Patrol data includes people who attempted to enter the country without going through the legal process. If you combine the two pools of data, the total number of encounters this February is 173% higher than it was last February. This is likely where Hudson’s figure comes from. The agency reported a total of 100,441 encounters in February, up from 36,687 last February. However, to focus on ""illegal border crossings,"" it’s more effective to omit field office encounters and focus on Border Patrol data. If we just look at encounters with Border Patrol, they triple from 30,077 last February to 96,974 this February. That’s an increase of 222%. One thing to note is that the agency tracks crossings — not people, meaning some of the documented crossings could be from the same person. In fact, the agency estimated that between last March and this February 38% of all encounters involved recidivism, or individuals who have been apprehended more than once. As for month-to-month numbers, encounters rose roughly 28% with or without field office data. In summary, Hudson is right in that the rise in illegal crossings was likely 173% — at least. He looked at the wrong numbers but the miss doesn’t undermine his point.  Now let’s look at what Hudson claims is the reason for the rise. PolitiFact NC interviewed four experts who each said Hudson inaccurately described Biden’s policies and overlooked the myriad of reasons for the situation at the border, which PolitiFact wrote about earlier this month. Does the wall have anything to do with the current problem at the border? Experts say no.  ""The wall was not a factor at all,"" said David Bier, an immigration expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. ""It has no effect on whether people cross the border — only on where they cross."" ""No more walls are being built right now. But it does not matter,"" said Tony Payan, director of the Center for the United States and Mexico at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. ""The wall has no practicable effect on crossborder irregular migrant traffic or drug smuggling for that matter,"" Payan said. It’s true that Biden has halted construction of the wall along the southern border. However, it’s wrong to suggest that further construction would have made a difference. As PolitiFact has previously reported, former President Donald Trump replaced roughly 200 miles of existing border fencing over four years but erected only a few miles of new border wall.  ""It is not as if continued construction of border walls and fences would have hermetically sealed the border tomorrow,"" said Lynn Marcus, director of Arizona University’s Community Immigration Law Placement Clinic. ""New segments of the wall take years to build,"" said Nicole Hallett, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School. ""The amount of wall that would have been built between January and now is negligible and would have practically no effect on how many people are crossing the border."" Now to the last part of Hudson’s tweet. Did Biden ""stop"" deportations? And is that part of the reason for the rise in border crossings? This is a gross mischaracterization. When Biden took office, his administration ordered a 100-day pause on the deportation of people with final orders of removal. However, that pause didn’t apply to people who posed a threat to national security, who were convicted of a felony, or who were incarcerated at the time of the memo. And a federal judge later blocked Biden’s move. Biden also started allowing some asylum-seekers back into the country. That rule-change is expected to affect 25,000 asylum cases, according to a PolitiFact story from mid-February. In the meantime, federal law allows border officials to turn people away because of the public health emergency. This law is referred to as Title 42. Out of the roughly 96,000 migrants encountered by Border Patrol in February, more than 70,000 were turned away because of this rule. Bottom line: Deportations have not stopped. What about a supposed ""catch and release"" policy? Trump and other conservatives have used this term derogatorily over the years, sometimes referring to any rule that allows an immigrant to walk free. However, this Obama-era rule specifically allows asylum seekers to remain in the U.S. while awaiting court dates. (PolitiFact went over the rule in a recent fact check of the Texas governor.)  The Trump administration tried to ban ""catch and release"" in 2018. Biden lifted Trump's edict in early February, with the border patrol agency citing housing limitations as part of the reason why. ""Per longstanding practice, when long-term holding solutions aren’t possible, some migrants will be processed for removal, provided a Notice to Appear, and released into the U.S. to await a future immigration hearing,"" an agency spokesman told Yahoo News. Experts dismissed the idea that ""catch and release"" has much to do with the rise in border crossings.  ""Biden hasn’t changed catch and release policy in any meaningful way from Jan. 20,"" said Bier, the Cato expert. ""More people are being released only because Mexico is refusing to take more than a certain number back. But he is removing far more and releasing far fewer migrants than Trump in the 2019 wave."" When we asked Hudson for the source of his information, his office cited four news articles about immigrants who said they expected Biden’s administration to grant them entry. Spokesman Greg Steele said Biden’s administration is clearly ""contributing to migrants surging to the border.""  Experts told PolitiFact they’re not surprised some migrants cite Biden as a reason for their reason for crossing the border, either because they’re overly optimistic or because they’re misinformed. ""No doubt, human smugglers take advantage of people's desperation by promising that, with the change in administrations, the U.S. will now welcome them with open arms,"" Marcus said. ""While such messages may give hope to some who incur substantial debt to undertake the dangerous journey to the U.S. border, they are not the main reason people leave, nor are they based on fact."" The four experts who emailed with PolitiFact NC about the situation said there are multiple reasons for the rise in border crossings.  ""The number of migrants are on the rise,"" said Payan, the Rice University expert. ""But, interestingly, they are showing the same pattern — they rise in the spring and summer and fall in the fall and winter."" They have cited warming weather, political instability in immigrants’ home countries, hurricanes that hit Central America last year, and the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. They also said Trump’s attempts to reject people seeking asylum, attempts that were challenged in the courts, created a logjam. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency mentioned some of these causes in a Feb. 10 press release. A Washington Post analysis found that the rise in migrants at the border follows a seasonal pattern set in fiscal year 2019, with the addition of pent-up demand from people who stayed home in 2020 because of the pandemic. Hallett, the expert at the University of Chicago, pointed out that border crossings still haven’t reached the level they were in spring 2019, when there were 100,000 crossings per month for four months straight.  ""That would suggest that something independent of U.S. policy is at least partly responsible for the increase,"" she said. Hudson said ""Illegal border crossings are up 173% from 1 year ago and 28% since January when President Biden stopped the wall & deportations and started catch & release."" Hudson’s numbers are slightly off, but his point about illegal crossings rising nearly 200% is accurate. However, experts say the reasons for the rise in border crossings are complex and not fairly summarized by pinning the blame on border wall construction and Biden’s deportation policies. We rate this claim Half True. PolitiFact reporter Miriam Valverde contributed to this article.",/factchecks/2021/mar/25/richard-hudson/border-crossings-are-not-because-biden-stopped-wal/

Democrat Tom Nelson right on claim that two thirds of U.S. senators are millionaires
","Democratic candidates are already starting to pop up for a 2022 run for U.S. Senate, all aiming for a seat held now by Republican Ron Johnson, who has not said if he’ll seek a third term. And it doesn’t look like the race will be a friendly one.  Johnson was already a top target of Democrats before he said the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol wasn’t an armed insurrection ( a claim we rated Pants on Fire) and before he forced a full-reading of the $1.9 trillion COVID relief plan advanced by Democrats and President Joe Biden (we rated his stance on full readings a Full Flop).  One of the Democratic candidates, Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson, has been taking shots at Johnson, but also took aim recently toward Milwaukee Bucks executive Aex Lasry, who has also announced his Democratic campaign.
  During a March 7, 2021 interview on WISN TV’s UPFRONT, Nelson said he had asked Lasry to not self-fund his campaign.  ""I think what’s really important here is you listen to what the people want, I think the last thing people want is for someone to come in and self-fund,"" Nelson said. ""Right now, two-thirds of the U.S. Senate is composed of millionaires. We need someone who is in touch with the people.""  For this fact-check, we are focusing on the part of Nelson’s claim that two-thirds those in the Senate are millionaires.  Is he right?  When asked for backup for the claim, the Nelson campaign pointed to an August 2020 fact-check of U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who claimed, in part, the Senate was ""dominated by millionaires."" PolitiFact National rated that claim True. That fact-check relied on an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, which examined net-worth data for senators from 2018 -- still the most recent data available.  The data comes from financial disclosure forms, which lawmakers are required to fill out. Because the forms don’t require exact values, only a range, the center calculated net worth for lawmakers by adding their assets, subtracting their liabilities and calculating the midpoint of the resulting range.  In all, 61 of the 100 senators had a net worth of at least $1 million -- with some having a net worth many times that amount. For example, Republican Kelly Loeffler of Georgia had a net worth of more than $500 million and Republican Rick Scott of Florida’s net worth was nearly $260 million. Also among the top:  Democrat Mark Warner of Virginia (more than $214 million) and Republican Mitt Romney of Utah (about $174 million).  Both Wisconsin senators met the threshold: Johnson was listed at $39 million, while Democrat Tammy Baldwin was listed at $1.1 million.  Of course, since the Center’s report last year, 10 seats changed. Of the 10 senators who were replaced, eight were millionaires. We could not locate recent net worth estimates for all of their replacements. That said, many of the new members are also millionaires. Democrat Mark Kelly of Arizona is worth between $10.8 million and $28 million, according to a January 2021 Newsweek report, while Democrat John Hickenlooper of Colorado is worth between $9 million and $27 million. Several others are also listed as worth more than $1 million.  According to a December 2020 report from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Georgia Democrats John Ossof and Raphael Warnock each have net worths well over $1 million as well. They replaced Republicans Loeffler and David Perdue, worth nearly $26 million.  Experts have noted in recent years that the cost of running for office -- in Wisconsin and across the nation -- has become increasingly difficult for candidates who cannot bring their own money to the table.  Robert Yablon, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said campaigns have become more expensive to run. Having money to start off a campaign can lead to better political consultants working on a campaign and likely even having wealthy friends willing to contribute large amounts, he said. The 2020 election is a good example of the escalating price, with seven campaigns bringing in $100 million or more in contributions -- more than ever before.  Yablon also noted that the Senate tends to attract people who have seen success in their life, whether in business or celebrity, which was likely lucrative. ""There is a long history of very wealthy people in the Senate,"" he said. ""The phenomenon is not new.""  Nelson, a Democrat running for US. Senate, said that two-thirds of those in the Senate were millionaires.  Based on data from 2018, last year of financial disclosures available, 61 Senators had an average net worth of more than $1 million, according to one estimate. So, that is nearly two-thirds.  Many of the 10 newly elected senators also have high net worths, but an updated tally is not yet available.  Nevertheless, political experts say the Senate is likely to attract campaigns from wealthier people, contributing to the high number of millionaires who currently hold seats.  We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2021/mar/25/tom-nelson/democrat-tom-nelson-right-claim-two-thirds-us-sena/

Boulder shooting suspect didn’t come to US during Obama administration

""New information coming in that Boulder shooter was a Syrian refugee who arrived via Obama-era asylum programs, per national security official,"" Posobiec, a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, said in the now-deleted tweet, which has been reposted on Instagram and Facebook.

(Screenshot from Instagram) On March 22, a gunman walked into a King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, a college town northwest of Denver, and opened fire. Ten people were killed in the shooting, including one police officer. Police arrested Alissa, 21, in connection with the attack, during which he was injured. The Boulder Police Department and the FBI are investigating the shooting, and have not established a motive. So we wanted to take a closer look at Posobiec’s claim about Alissa’s background. The suspected shooter was born in Syria, but the best available information shows he did not move to the U.S. during the Obama administration. It’s unclear if he immigrated as a refugee. Alissa’s brother, Ali Aliwi Alissa, told CNN that their family emigrated from Syria in 2002. Before it was taken down, Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa’s Facebook page also said he arrived in the U.S. that year, when Barack Obama, who became president in 2009, was still an Illinois state senator. Court records and Alissa’s Facebook page show that he was born in Syria in 1999. According to CNN, Alissa and his family had resided in Arvada, Colo., since 2014. The suspected shooter graduated from Arvada West High School in May 2018, the Arvada Press reported, before which he attended Denver South High School. We don’t yet know the details of how Alissa’s family immigrated to the U.S. However, the Syrian civil war began in March 2011, during which millions of refugees started to flee the country. The ensuing refugee crisis began nearly a decade after Alissa’s family emigrated from Syria. We reached out to Boulder police for more information, but we haven’t heard back. Posobiec’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

What Donald Trump omits in his attack on Joe Biden about border security
","Former President Donald Trump said that the Biden administration has created a ""national disaster"" at the border by ditching Trump’s immigration policies.  ""We proudly handed the Biden administration the most secure border in history,"" Trump said in a March 21 statement. ""All they had to do was keep this smooth-running system on autopilot. Instead, in the span of just (a) few weeks, the Biden administration has turned a national triumph into a national disaster.""  Trump was responding to comments on the Sunday news shows by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas who pointed the finger back at the Trump administration for the border woes. ""The entire system under United States law that has been in place throughout administrations of both parties was dismantled in its entirety by the Trump administration,"" Mayorkas said on ABC This Week. We found that the situation at the border is more complicated than either Trump or the Biden administration is indicating. Trump’s claim that the border was the ""most secure"" and ""on autopilot"" is a significant exaggeration.  We found there is no simple metric to determine if Biden inherited the ""most secure"" border. Some cite miles of barriers, while others use various apprehension figures.  ""A secure border is really about definitions, and each side has their own definition of secure,"" said Laura Collins, director of the George W. Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative. Trump’s office didn’t respond to our emails asking what metric he was citing on border security. When Trump said near the end of the campaign that ""we achieved the most secure border in American history"" he cited the number of miles of border barriers that were built. But most of the miles were to replace existing structures, including in low-traffic areas.  Another metric that Trump highlighted in May was apprehension numbers on the southwest border. Immigration experts have told us that high apprehension numbers could be an indication of effective border enforcement, others say low apprehension numbers are a sign that U.S. policies are working to deter illegal immigration in the first place. Some experts point to the border apprehension rate, which is the proportion of attempted border crossers apprehended. The Department of Homeland Security’s August border security metrics report showed that the apprehension rate in fiscal year 2016 — Obama’s last full year — was the highest of any year between 2000 and 2018.  So by that metric, the border was most secure in 2016, said Jessica Bolter, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. But the federal government hasn’t yet released more recent data, so we can’t use the apprehension rate to evaluate Trump’s claim that he handed off the most secure border to Biden. Finally, due to the barriers and other deterrents at the border, unauthorized migrants largely enter at ports of entry and overstay a visa or turn themselves in and request asylum. That’s why miles of the border fence don’t tell us much about the status of border security.  While Trump presents the border surge as a ""disaster"" under Biden, the spike in migrants, especially unaccompanied minors, started in the spring of 2020 during the Trump administration and generally continued to climb each month. The numbers of migrants apprehended at the border rose between January and February, but it’s still less than the surge in May 2019. And in February, most of the encounters that Customs and Border Protection recorded at the border resulted in quick expulsions under the same public health-related authority that was invoked under the Trump administration. Besides U.S. policy, factors that drive migrants to leave their home countries have included economic havoc caused by hurricanes and the pandemic, and yearslong problems associated with violence. The numbers of migrants arriving at the border also tend to spike in the spring and summer months. When Biden took office, there was a pent-up demand to cross the border due to asylum seekers who were waiting in Mexican border towns because of Trump’s ""Remain in Mexico"" program and pandemic-related border closures.  The Biden administration has repeatedly said that the border is closed. But it has made some policy changes, such as choosing not to expel unaccompanied children who cross illegally, even though it has the legal authority to do so. Trump said Biden could have operated on autopilot, but experts said each administration must examine legal rulings and current conditions.  ""There is no such thing as 'autopilot' in immigration,"" said Susan Martin, an immigration expert at Georgetown University. ""I don't see how Biden could have maintained Trump's policies, given the outcome of the election and the shifting situation on the border."" The Trump administration’s asylum policies on the border were also challenged in court. ""Operating on autopilot might have been a problematic policy because it involved denying people their ability to lodge an asylum case,"" said Josiah Heyman, director of the Center for Inter-American and Border Studies at the University of Texas at El Paso Because Congress has failed to reach agreement on major immigration policies, that leaves it up to each new presidential administration to issue orders, set priorities and use words to convey a tone about immigration.  ""The border surge is just the latest symptom of a broken immigration system,"" Collins said. ""Congress needs to do the hard work of modernizing our immigration system and adopting an ‘all of the above’ border policy that anticipates future crises and has the flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances."" Trump said ""we proudly handed the Biden administration the most secure border in history. All they had to do was keep this smooth-running system on autopilot."" While Trump promoted building a wall, some metrics suggest Trump didn’t attain the most secure border in history. And Trump ignores that the surge started in the spring of 2020 when he was still in office.  He also grossly oversimplified how the immigration system works. It’s not as straightforward as keeping it on ""autopilot.""  Biden’s actions and tone on immigration play a role in migration, but so do other factors such as ongoing economic and social havoc in Central America.

Fact-checking claim about Trump administration changes to the immigration system
","President Joe Biden’s top immigration official defended the federal response to the growing numbers of people arriving at the southern border, and claimed that current efforts are complicated by the Trump administration’s drastic changes. Alejandro Mayorkas, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said the Biden administration has a plan and knows what to do, but it will take time to get things done. ""And why does it take time now? Why is it especially challenging and difficult now? Because the entire system under United States law that has been in place throughout administrations of both parties was dismantled in its entirety by the Trump administration,"" Mayorkas told ABC News’ Martha Raddatz on March 21. The Biden administration is ""rebuilding the system"" to address the needs of unaccompanied children making their way to the southern border, he said. How accurate is Mayorkas’ claim that the Trump administration ""dismantled"" the ""entire system""? There’s some truth to his broad claim, but the challenges the Biden administration faces can’t all be blamed on the prior administration, immigration experts said. ""The border surge is just the latest symptom of a broken immigration system,"" said Laura Collins, director of the George W. Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative. Experts said it’s important to take a step back and note the underlying factors that push people out of their countries and why the U.S. — regardless of who’s president — has trouble handling their arrival. Persistent corruption, poverty, lack of opportunity and violence in Central America drive people to leave their families and seek a better life in the United States. Recently, hurricanes in Central America made things worse for many people, ruining their crops and displacing them from their homes. The coronavirus pandemic has also left many people without a job. On the U.S. side of the issue, Congress hasn’t passed meaningful legislation to modernize the legal immigration system or to better prepare the federal government for surges at the border. (The last big immigration law was enacted in 1986, when Ronald Reagan was president.) It’s also worth noting that there are seasonal trends at play — migration tends to increase in the spring. DHS directed PolitiFact to a statement Mayorkas issued March 16 about the Trump administration dismantling the asylum system. Many people who make it to the southern border ask for asylum. ""We have had to rebuild the entire system, including the policies and procedures required to administer the asylum laws that Congress passed long ago,"" Mayorkas said. Under federal law, immigrants may be granted asylum if they have been persecuted or fear they will be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. To apply for asylum, people have to be physically present in the U.S. They can apply even if they arrive without legal permission. A backlog of cases existed before Trump took office and continued to grow during his tenure, despite his attempts to limit the number of people filing cases. The Trump administration revamped the asylum-seeking process in many ways, including by: Denying asylum to people who did not ask for protection in another country first; Entering into agreements with Central American countries so that they’d take asylum seekers who would have otherwise applied for protection in the United States; and Launching the ""Remain in Mexico"" program that sent asylum seekers to Mexico to wait there for a resolution of their case. Previous administrations allowed people into the United States as their case made its way through the complex immigration system. (It can take years for cases to be resolved.) Trump’s administration also tried to discourage people from coming to the U.S. to apply for asylum by implementing a policy that ultimately separated parents and children upon arrival at the border. The Biden administration got rid of that policy and launched a task force to help reunify families. Biden’s administration has also begun letting in asylum seekers stranded in Mexico. Separately, Trump also weakened another venue for legal migration — the U.S. refugee program. People apply for refugee admission from outside the U.S. (in their home countries or in refugee camps elsewhere). Before leaving office, President Barack Obama said the U.S. should let in as many as 110,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017. When Trump took over, he said that was too much and capped it at 50,000. Trump continued to lower the caps every year he was in office. Biden has pledged to significantly raise the admissions cap. Mayorkas’ statement also said that Trump ""tore down"" the Central American Minors program — created in 2014 by the Obama administration to address a surge of children fleeing gang violence and arriving alone at the border. The program sought to deter Central American children from making the dangerous trip north. The program allowed certain parents lawfully present in the United States to petition for their children in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to come in as refugees. Children ineligible for refugee admission but at risk of violence were eligible for immigration parole (allowed into the U.S. temporarily, but not formally admitted under the U.S. immigration system). The Trump administration in 2017 decided to end the program. Mayorkas and Democratic lawmakers argue that its absence contributes to the current surge. But Democrats are overstating the program’s impact, experts said. Plenty of kids were left out of it, due to eligibility requirements and its lengthy application process, said Jessica Bolter, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. The program ""had not yet developed into a fully effective alternative to illegal immigration for a broad population,"" Bolter said. Also, it ended years ago, so ""it doesn’t make sense that the effects would suddenly appear this year,"" she said. Biden’s administration is restarting the program. Mayorkas also claimed that Trump cut ""foreign aid funding"" and that ""no longer did we resource efforts in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to tackle the root causes of people fleeing their homes."" He’s right about cuts in foreign aid, and that may have exacerbated some conditions that potential migrants were facing, experts said. But they also emphasized that other factors likely carried more weight in people’s decision to migrate. Obama’s administration in 2014 decided that improving living conditions in Central America would be beneficial to the U.S. and approved a new strategy to increase annual foreign aid to the region. Trump’s administration did the opposite, proposing cuts instead. Annual funding for the Central America strategy declined from $750 million in fiscal year 2017 to $505.9 million in fiscal year 2021, a Congressional Research Service analysis found. And amid an immigration surge in 2019, the Trump administration suspended that support while it negotiated asylum agreements with El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. That pause ""was a colossal waste,"" said Susan Martin, a professor emerita at Georgetown University and director of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform from 1992 to 1997. None of the three countries are safe or capable of processing asylum applications, she said. Aid targeted toward the problems in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador ""would have been much more effective in reducing emigration pressures over time,"" Martin said. It’s hard to tell at this point how much impact those aid cuts have had on migration. ""A lot of foreign assistance is about investing in long-term change rather than short-term results,"" Collins said. ""Lots of foreign assistance won’t fix migration on its own, but it is an important piece of a comprehensive approach."" Biden has pledged to invest $4 billion in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to improve conditions there and lessen the desire to migrate to the U.S. Mayorkas said the border surge is ""challenging"" because the immigration system that had been in place for decades ""was dismantled in its entirety by the Trump administration."" Trump’s administration did make significant changes to the U.S. immigration system, including the asylum-seeking process for migrants arriving at the southern border. While those actions may have an impact on migration, they are not wholly responsible for a surge in migration or the Biden administration’s ability to deal with it, experts said. Mayorkas’ statement is partly accurate. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2021/mar/24/alejandro-mayorkas/fact-checking-claim-about-trump-administration-cha/

These posts refer to Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Brett Blomme, who was recently arrested and charged with seven counts of child pornography.  Before being elected as  a judge, Blomme served as the chair of the Board of Zoning Appeals for the city of Milwaukee. Until August 2020, he was CEO of the Cream City Foundation, an LGBTQ advocacy nonprofit organization that gives grants and scholarships and borrows its name from a Milwaukee nickname that references the color of bricks produced there in the 1800s. The foundation published a statement denouncing Blomme following news of his arrest.  According to the Drag Queen Story Hour website, the organization holds events where entertainers dress in drag and read stories to children in libraries and schools. The program aims to help kids ""see people who defy rigid gender restrictions and imagine a world where people can present as they wish, where dress up is real."" The organization has more than 40 chapters in the United States and additional chapters in Europe, Australia, Mexico and Japan.  Cream City Foundation acted as the fiscal sponsor of the Milwaukee chapter of Drag Queen Story Hour. A fiscal sponsorship is a financial partnership that allows a non-tax-exempt organization like the Milwaukee chapter to receive donations. A charitable organization – in this case the Cream City Foundation – receives donations meant for the Milwaukee chapter and gives the donation to them in the form of grants.  But Blomme never held a position with Drag Queen Story Hour Milwaukee, much less served as president of the national umbrella organization.  Jonathan Hamilt, the executive director of the national Drag Queen Story Hour organization, said in an emailed statement that the foundation’s relationship with Drag Queen Story Hour was ""strictly financial.""  ""DQSH Milwaukee has never been run by the Cream City Foundation nor Brett Blomme, (nor) have either participated in planning, organizing, hosting or performing at any of our events"" he wrote.

AR-15 style weapons were used in 10 major shootings
","Semi-automatic rifles in the AR-15 style have been the weapon of choice in numerous deadly mass shootings. Until 2004, they were banned as assault weapons under federal law. Gun control advocates have focused on firearms of this sort for decades. In the arrest warrant for the gunman in the March 22 shooting that killed 10 people in a Boulder, Colo., supermarket, police describe one of the weapons as ""a rifle (possible AR-15)."" Adam Best, an entrepreneur and progressive activist with over 189,000 followers on Twitter, posted a list with 11 other shootings over the past decade that he said involved an AR-15. Boulder: AR-15Orlando: AR-15Parkland: AR-15Las Vegas: AR-15Aurora, CO: AR-15Sandy Hook: AR-15Waffle House: AR-15San Bernardino: AR-15Midland/Odessa: AR-15Poway synagogue: AR-15Sutherland Springs: AR-15Tree of Life Synagogue: AR-15 AR-15 once referred to a specific model of rifle, but the label has come to be recognized in recent decades as a shorthand term for a category of firearms that share certain characteristics. (The AR stands for ArmaLite, the original maker of the AR-15 rifle.) They are semi-automatic, which means the trigger must be pulled to fire each round, and a new round moves into the chamber after each pull. As rifles, they have a general shape and configuration, and can be customized with a choice of grips, triggers, stock, and more. We reviewed news and law enforcement reports on the shootings listed in Best’s tweet.  We verified that all but one did involve at least one weapon in the AR-15 style. The possible exception was the deadly attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. Orlando June 12, 2016: A gunman began shooting inside the Pulse, killing 49 people and wounding 53. Orlando Police officers shot and killed him after a three-hour standoff. One of the weapons was a SIG Sauer MCX. The SIG Sauer takes a lot of the form and functions of the AR-15 but with reworked internal mechanics and some other changes. For example, the SIG Sauer is built to handle a different caliber round than the standard AR-15. The two weapons have so much in common that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms called the SIG Sauer used in Orlando a "".223 caliber AR type rifle.""  Guns traced in #Orlando shooting: .223 caliber AR type rifle and 9mm semiautomatic pistol.

Johnson errs claiming Senate had no violence Jan.6
","Sen. Ron Johnson has taken every opportunity in recent months to downplay the seriousness of what took place in the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and the role of President Donald Trump’s supporters in it. On Feb. 7, the Wisconsin Republican pondered whether the impeachment proceedings were a ""diversionary operation … meant to deflect away from potentially what (U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi) knew and when she knew it."" On Feb. 15, he asserted the Jan. 6 incursion ""didn’t seem like an armed insurrection."" We rated that claim Pants on Fire. On March 11, he compared the Jan. 6 event and rioters to the social justice movement. ""I knew those were people (on Jan. 6) that love this country, that truly respect law enforcement, would never do anything to break the law, and so I wasn't concerned,"" Johnson said in an interview on conservative radio host Joe Pag’s show. ""Now, had the tables been turned — Joe, this could get me in trouble — had the tables been turned, and President Trump won the election and those were tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters, I might have been a little concerned."" As a quick aside, we’ll note the rank absurdity of attributing a respect for law enforcement and country to a group of rioters that injured 140 police officers, with one winding up dead, while violently forcing their way into the Capitol in an attempt to halt the Democratic process. But that comparison brings us to Johnson’s latest assertion, which came as he sought to defend those remarks March 20, 2021, to a conservative group in West Allis.   ""One of the reasons I'm being attacked is because I very honestly said I didn't feel threatened on January 6. I didn't,"" Johnson said. ""There was much more violence on the House side. There was no violence on the Senate side, in terms of the chamber. I mean, you’ve seen the video, guys just strolling in there, and the police just going, kinda saying, do you want to back off?"" ""We exited out of there and I walked back to my office. That’s it. … I didn’t feel threatened. I never felt threatened. It’s a true statement."" We can’t fact check descriptions of an emotional state. But Johnson went a significant step beyond how he felt in asserting there was ""no violence on the Senate side."" Let’s drill down on that. Several of the most tragically memorable moments occurred around the House chamber. That’s where we saw pictures of law enforcement wielding guns inside a barricaded chamber as protesters pushed at the door. And a Capitol Police officer shot and killed 35-year-old Ashli Babbitt as she climbed through another barricade just outside the chamber. But Johnson here is drawing a largely meaningless distinction. If armed men break into a home and attack the residents, the attack wouldn’t be any more or less violent based on which particular room people were attacked in. The hundreds of people swarming the Capitol in search of lawmakers, intending to halt the machinations of democracy, didn’t get in by asking politely. They forced entry to the seat of American democracy by arming themselves with all manner of weapons, forcing their way violently past law enforcement and breaking through windows and doors. In any case, we got a more detailed picture of the Senate happenings during the second day of the Senate impeachment trial in February. The Senate had convened to debate challenges to the Arizona electoral vote lodged in a joint session of Congress when the rioters breached the Capitol. ""The threat to the Senate was no less than that to the members of the House,"" U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., one of the House Impeachment managers, said during his presentation. Senators sheltered in the chamber for the first 15 minutes after rioters broke through windows on the Senate side and stormed the halls around the chamber, as noted by CNN. During that time Officer Eugene Goodman faced down dozens of rioters on his own, retreating twice up a flight of stairs to lure the mob away from the Senate chambers. He was hailed as a hero by lawmakers. ""You know how close you came to the mob,"" Swalwell told the Senate. ""Some of you I understand could hear them."" About 2:30 p.m. local time, the senators were hustled out of the chamber by law enforcement. Security video shows a mass of police officers creating a line at the end of a connecting hallway to block protesters from reaching the senators’ escape route. ""As you were moving through that hallway, I paced it off. You were just 58 steps away from where the mob was amassing, and where police were rushing to stop them,"" Swalwell said. Rioters breached the Senate chamber about 2:45 p.m., with one man heard on video asking, ""Where the (expletive) are they?"" The rioters rifled through desks, stole documents and posed for pictures. Several were wearing helmets and tactical gear, and two were carrying zip cuffs. Jacob Chansley of Arizona, the Qanon adherent who donned a fur hat and carried a six-foot spear, left a note for Vice President Mike Pence that read in part, ""It’s only a matter of time, justice is coming."" ""If the doors to this chamber had been breached just minutes earlier, imagine what they could have done with those cuffs,"" Swalwell said. Luke Mogelson, a reporter for The New Yorker who videotaped the Senate chamber throughout the incident, described a bizarre scene in which a lone police officer, noting he was outnumbered, inquired, ""Any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate wing?"" When a mass of officers later arrived, the rioters were allowed to simply walk out of the chamber, with one officer thanking them for being peaceful even as he stood with a ripped shirt, a crooked tie and eyes red from pepper spray. Johnson said at a West Allis presentation he didn’t feel threatened Jan. 6 because ""there was no violence on the Senate side, in terms of the chamber."" The highest-profile violent acts indeed occurred around the House chamber. But this is an absurd description for any element of an event where hundreds of rioters forced their way past police and into the U.S. Capitol, forcing lawmakers to scurry to safety and leaving more than 100 injured officers in their wake. The fact no one was killed or injured in the chamber does little to lessen the violence inherent to the presence of rioters who acted violently to get in the building. Senators like Johnson had the luxury of being potentially less fearful only because of officers like Goodman and whatever happenstance led more rioters initially to the House chamber, allowing senators to escape before rioters forced their way into the chamber.

No, the federal government isn’t using the Patriot Act to treat parents like domestic terrorists
","After U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland told the FBI and every U.S. attorney to pay attention to threats against school officials, top Republicans have charged that the Biden administration is cracking down on parents with legitimate gripes over school policies. When Garland appeared before the House Judiciary Committee Oct. 21, Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, said that the Justice Department had unloaded ""the full power of the federal law enforcement in this country on involved parents"" at the behest of the National School Boards Association. Chabot focused on the Patriot Act. ""I remember clearly that we were … concerned about potential abuse of this new law enforcement tool,"" Chabot said Oct. 21. ""I can tell you, not in a million years, did we dream that one day, we’d see the Justice Department treat American parents as domestic terrorists."" Is that an accurate take on the Justice Department’s actions? When Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said Garland wanted the FBI to ""go after"" parents who spoke out against critical race theory, we rated that False. We gave a False rating to viral Instagram posts that said parents had been labeled as domestic terrorists. Now, we look at whether the Justice Department has invoked the Patriot Act against parents of schoolchildren. It has not, and Garland responded firmly to Chabot’s suggestion. ""I can't imagine any circumstance in which the Patriot Act would be used in the circumstances of parents complaining about their children,"" Garland said at the hearing. ""Nor can I imagine a circumstance where they would be labeled as domestic terrorism.""  Chabot spokesman Brian Griffith walked us through why Chabot asserts the Patriot Act is in play, and we gathered the legal insights of several law professors, including a former federal prosecutor, to help sort out the issues. On Oct. 4, Garland sent a memo to the FBI, every U.S. attorney and the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. ""While spirited debate about policy matters is protected under our Constitution, that protection does not extend to threats of violence or efforts to intimidate individuals based on their views,"" Garland wrote. Garland told the FBI to hold meetings across the country and bring together leaders at all levels of government to discuss ""strategies for addressing threats against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff, and (to) open dedicated lines of communication for threat reporting, assessment, and response."" Garland’s memo makes no mention of the Patriot Act or terrorism, but the Justice Department’s press release about the memo listed a number of departmental divisions that would be involved.  ""Efforts are expected to include the creation of a task force, consisting of representatives from the department’s Criminal Division, National Security Division, Civil Rights Division, the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, the FBI, the Community Relations Service and the Office of Justice Programs,"" the press office wrote. Some Republican lawmakers view the National Security Division as a red flag. The division was created by the 2006 reauthorization of the Patriot Act. The change put a number of existing Justice Department offices under one roof. The focus was largely on foreign terrorists, but the original Patriot Act, championed by Republicans, included a definition of domestic terrorism, and that fell within the scope of the new division. Chabot spokesman Griffith said Garland’s words in his memo about ""threats of violence or efforts to intimidate individuals based on their views,"" mirrors the definition of domestic terrorism in federal law. Specifically, the part in Section 802 that talks about ""acts dangerous to human life,"" designed ""to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion."" ""What Attorney General Garland is saying in that first paragraph is that parents are entitled to express their views under the First Amendment, but should they cross the line and either threaten or attempt to intimidate school board members, they may be guilty of the federal crime of domestic terrorism,"" Griffith said. ""And the main federal law utilized in investigating alleged domestic terrorism is the Patriot Act."" Griffith noted that the National School Boards Association listed the Patriot Act in its letter to the administration. It was one among many laws the association cited. For over a decade, the Justice Department has dismissed concerns over the broad domestic use of the Patriot Act. The law would be triggered, the department has said, only if there was ""criminal wrongdoing that could result in death."" Law professor and former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman at Columbia University said Griffith overstates the significance of the Patriot Act. ""The Patriot Act has vanishingly little to do with criminalizing any of this, and is unlikely to provide the legal authority needed to prosecute threats and other forms of intimidation over which DOJ has jurisdiction,"" Richman said. ""A variety of criminal acts that federal enforcers might well categorize as domestic terrorism — because of the motivation or groups involved — are covered by ordinary criminal statutes."" A report from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy arm of Congress, also found that the Patriot Act is far from the main weapon in the legal arsenal. ""Numerous federal statutes offer prosecutors options in charging violent and destructive conduct,"" the July 2 report said. William Charles Banks, founding director of Syracuse University’s Institute for Security Policy and Law, said there’s also nothing new about the need to distinguish between expressing deep anger with government workers and making criminal threats. ""The lines that may be crossed are the same ones that law enforcement has had to observe and navigate for most of the last century, since the U.S. Supreme Court said that the First Amendment protects expressive conduct up to the point that it incentivizes imminent lawless action,"" Banks said. ""Likelihood of violence and imminence of it are the two key factors, and they are always fact-sensitive."" Simply put, violence and true threats of violence are against the law, and would be even if the Patriot Act never existed. Gregory Magarian at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis said Chabot ""stretches the statements in the memo and the press release far past their breaking point."" Chabot got ahead of himself, Magarian said, because so far the Justice Department has done very little. ""The memo and press release say nothing about whether the DOJ will take particular actions against particular actors or what those actions might be,"" Magarian said. Magarian added that while the National Security Division will be part of a task force, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the law that created the division will play a key role. There are grounds to worry about what the federal government might do, said George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin. ""It’s not the federal government’s job to enforce state and local law,"" Somin said. ""There’s no evidence of a need for the Justice Department to get involved where people behave obnoxiously. If people turn to violence, these are matters that states and local governments can handle."" Somin agreed that so far, the federal government ""hasn’t actually done anything."" ""They've made statements that raise concerns,"" Somin said. ""If they have something different in mind, there are ways they could clarify their intentions and quell a lot of that."" Griffith said that the primary concern is about using the surveillance and investigative tools provided under the Patriot Act, not prosecution itself. ""Attorney General Garland oversold the existence of these acts, and that will lead to more surveillance and more investigations than would otherwise occur,"" Griffith said. ""I don’t view that as terribly speculative."" Chabot said the U.S. Justice Department is treating ""American parents as domestic terrorists"" under the Patriot Act. The Justice Department has moved to create a task force that spans federal, state and local agencies to focus on threats against local school officials. The department’s National Security Division is one of many participants in that task force, and it was created through the Patriot Act. Legal scholars say the Patriot Act plays little role in criminalizing threats of this sort. Many other federal and state statutes apply to violence and threats of violence. The memo and press release from the Justice Department don’t mention terrorism or the Patriot Act, and to date, the federal government has not acted against anyone. There can be a concern about government overreach, but at this point, those concerns are theoretical.

Fact-checking Tom Cotton on Arkansas’ new congressional map
","Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., took a swipe at Illinois on Twitter, painting the two states as taking radically different approaches to redistricting — the once-every-decade practice of redrawing congressional and legislative lines in response to the latest census. Cotton’s Oct. 21 tweet argued that Arkansas’ new congressional district map, drawn by Republicans in an overwhelmingly Republican state, was superior to the one drafted by Democrats, who control the levers of redistricting in Illinois. ""Arkansas Republicans made a compact and fair map that keeps communities together,"" Cotton tweeted. ""Illinois Democrats created an atrocious gerrymander to take power. Yet the Dems are shamelessly attacking Arkansas. Their crocodile tears should be ignored."" Arkansas Republicans made a compact and fair map that keeps communities together. Illinois Democrats created an atrocious gerrymander to take power. Yet the Dems are shamelessly attacking Arkansas. Their crocodile tears should be ignored. #arpx pic.twitter.com/MTbjdN12ge For starters, we should note that the Arkansas map shown in Cotton’s tweet was final and had been enacted, whereas the Illinois map was a draft that may or may not be made official. Cotton didn’t mention that. (It’s also worth noting that when population is distributed unevenly within a state — as is the case with metropolitan Chicago in the northeast corner of Illinois — the maps will tend to look messier than in states with smaller variances in population.) Meanwhile, critics of excessive partisanship in redistricting would find common cause with Cotton on the shape of the Illinois map. Illinois’ draft map — which would likely produce a delegation of 14 Democrats and just three Republicans, in a state that Joe Biden won by a 57%-40% margin — is a ""gerrymander that would make deceased Gov. Elbridge Gerry blush,"" wrote David Wasserman, who tracks redistricting for the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. (Gerry was an 18th- and 19th-century Massachusetts politician whose reputation for drawing creative district lines produced the term ""gerrymandering."") Still, one of Cotton’s key assertions — that the new Arkansas congressional map ""keeps communities together"" — is inaccurate, as long as you consider the largest metropolitan area in the state to be a ""community."" (Cotton’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Specifically, the new Arkansas map splits up the largest county in the state — Pulaski County, which includes the state’s capital, Little Rock, which is more than twice as big as the state’s second-largest city, Fayetteville. Pulaski County is also more racially diverse than the state as a whole. The county is 52% non-Hispanic white and 38% Black, while the state is 70% non-Hispanic white and 15% Black. This diversity had electoral implications: It helped make Pulaski County one of only eight counties out of Arkansas’ 75 to back Biden in 2020. The Democratic nominee won 60% of the vote in Pulaski County.  For the past decade, Pulaski County has been fully part of the 2nd district, represented by Republican French Hill. Wasserman noted that in recent elections, Hill’s seat has been at least somewhat competitive. Hill won by six points in 2018 and 11 points in 2020. But by adding rural Cleburne County, where Donald Trump won 81% of the vote in 2020, and subtracting Black neighborhoods in Pulaski County, the Republican map-drawers appear to have succeeded in ""downgrading Democrats from a nuisance to total irrelevance"" in Hill’s district, Wasserman concluded. ""On the surface, it’s pure gerrymandering,"" said state Senate minority leader Keith Ingram, according to the Hill. ""They took high minority populations and split them. They have diluted the overall impact of the minority vote by doing this."" In fact, the new map doesn’t just just divide Pulaski County — it splits it three ways. Under the new map, only one of Arkansas’ four U.S. House seats doesn’t have a piece of Pulaski County. That’s a major departure from past practice. The county has never been split between multiple districts ""in any decade since the modern redistricting process began in the 1960s,"" wrote political analyst Reid Wilson after the map was finalized. Even the state’s Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, expressed reservations about the map design. Hutchinson let the map become law without his signature; if he had vetoed it, his veto would have been easily overridden. ""I am concerned about the impact of the redistricting plan on minority populations,"" Hutchinson told reporters. ""While the percentage of minority populations for three of the four congressional districts do not differ that much from the current percentages, the removal of minority areas in Pulaski County into two different congressional districts does raise concerns."" Hutchinson all but encouraged critics of the map to file a lawsuit seeking to overturn it. ""This will enable those who wish to challenge the redistricting plan in court to do so,"" Hutchinson said. Other Republican officials rejected Hutchinson’s view of the map and echoed Cotton’s assertion that the redraw kept jurisdictions whole.  ""The new congressional districts are compact and keep community interests together,"" state GOP chair Jonelle Fulmer said in a statement. ""These lines are largely consistent with the existing lines, which were drawn by Democrats in 2010."" The new map does split fewer counties than the previous map did, cutting the number from five to two. The other split county in the new map is Sebastian County, which includes Fort Smith. However, splitting Pulaski County has a far bigger impact. At almost 400,000 residents, Pulaski County accounts for 13% of the state’s population. Ranking second is Benton County, which includes Bentonville and Rogers and has 284,333 residents, or 9% of the state’s population. In the meantime, the Black percentage in Pulaski County is also twice as high as it is in any of the other nine most populous counties in the state, which increases the impact of the split on minority voters. ""There is an argument to be made that the decision to split Pulaski allows for some of the more rural counties to avoid splits, but in terms of population impact, it is clearly divisive,"" said Hal Bass, an emeritus political scientist at Ouachita Baptist University. It’s worth noting that in another state where redistricting was controlled by Democrats, Oregon, lawmakers used a similar tactic to produce a favorable map. Democrats enacted a map that split the state’s largest city, Portland, into three districts. Cotton said that the newly drawn congressional district map in Arkansas ""keeps communities together."" The newly drawn map does reduce the number of split counties in Arkansas compared with the previous decade’s map. However, Cotton ignores the most significant impact: For the first time, the map splits Pulaski County three ways. Pulaski is easily the state’s most populous county, as well as the most racially diverse (and most Democratic) big county in the state. Cotton’s claim has an element of truth but leaves a misleading impression about the impact of redistricting.

Southwest CEO said employees won’t be fired over its COVID-19 vaccine mandate
","As U.S. airlines tell their employees to get vaccinated against the coronavirus or risk getting fired, one company says it won’t terminate its unvaccinated workers, according to a Facebook post. The post is an image of text claiming Southwest Airlines ""will no longer terminate employees over the mandate."""" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But in this case, the post is accurate.

Most major airlines in the United States are requiring employees to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. The moves followed President Joe Biden’s announcement in July that federal government employees and contractors would be required to verify their vaccination status. Many airlines are considered federal contractors, and Southwest has worked with the government to fly military personnel and mail for the U.S. Postal Service. Southwest announced on Oct. 4 that it would follow Biden's vaccine directive, saying in a statement that employees ""must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, or be approved for a religious, medical or disability accommodation, by Dec. 8, 2021, to continue employment with the airline."" Eight days later, in an interview with ""Good Morning America,"" Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said the company will follow Biden’s order, but won’t terminate any of its employees if they choose not to get vaccinated. ""We’re not going to fire any employees over this. We are urging all of our employees to get vaccinated,"" Kelly said. ""If they can’t get vaccinated, we are urging them to seek an accommodation."" The company said in a statement to PolitiFact that it ""does not want anyone to lose their job over this mandate."" Employees have until Nov. 24 to submit proof that they are fully vaccinated or else request a religious or medical exemption. But according to comments Kelly made Oct. 21 in the company’s third-quarter earnings call, neither that deadline nor the federal government’s Dec. 8 deadline for contractors will result in Southwest workers losing their jobs.   ""We're not going to fire anybody who doesn't get vaccinated,"" Kelly said. ""Nobody is going to lose their job on December the 9th if we're not perfectly in compliance."" Brandy King, a Southwest spokeswoman, told NPR it wanted to give ""adequate time"" for employees whose exemptions weren't granted after the deadline passes to get fully vaccinated.  Under Biden's order, unvaccinated individuals can continue to work as long as they wear a face-covering, physically distance themselves from other employees and customers, and undergo weekly COVID-19 testing. Meanwhile, United Airlines announced Oct. 13 that it was terminating 232 employees who refused to get vaccinated or seek an exemption by the company’s Sept. 28 deadline. RELATED VIDEO A Facebook post claims that Southwest Airlines will no longer fire its employees who choose to remain unvaccinated against COVID-19. The company announced in early October that employees must be vaccinated or seek an exemption from the vaccine to continue employment. However, the company’s CEO later said that no one will be fired over the vaccine mandate, and that the airline will encourage unvaccinated workers to seek an ""accommodation.""  Employees whose exemptions have not been processed or approved by Dec. 8 will remain employed, and the company will adhere to COVID-19 safety protocols as it encourages its unvaccinated workers to get the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the company’s spokesperson and its CEO.

 No, Biden didn’t flash a white power sign at a Black man during CNN’s town hall in Baltimore
","On Oct. 21, President Joe Biden answered audience questions at a town hall hosted by CNN in Baltimore.

""I’m literally shaking.""  The post includes an image of the president during the town hall holding his hand up to his eye with his thumb and pointer finger joined and his other fingers up — a hand gesture that typically means ""OK"" but in recent years has been connected to white supremacy.  ""You have 55 corporations, for example, in the United States of America, making over $40 billion, don’t pay a cent,"" Biden said, bringing his fingers forming a circle to his eye as pictured in the Instagram post. ""Not a single little red cent."" First, a word of caution about interpreting that gesture as a white power gesture. According to the Anti-Defamation League, in 2017, members of the website 4chan falsely claimed that it represented the letters ""WP"" for ""white power."" ""The hoaxers hoped that the media and liberals would overreact by condemning a common image as white supremacist,"" the Anti-Defamation League says in this article explaining the gesture. While overwhelmingly people use the gesture to signify assent or approval, ""as well as other usages unrelated to white supremacy,"" the league says, it has also been used as a sincere expression of white supremacy.  In this case, however, the context makes clear that Biden is using the gesture to illustrate the number zero, as in how many cents he said some corporations pay in taxes.  RELATED VIDEO  That’s also how Frederick, the man who asked the question, interpreted the gesture.  ""He was saying the biggest corporations pay zero income tax,"" Frederick told us.

Fact-checking Joe Biden about job gains on his watch
","During a CNN town hall in Baltimore, President Joe Biden offered a talking point he’d used numerous times before to tout the country’s economic gains on his administration’s watch. ""We’ve created more jobs in the first eight months of my administration than any president in American history — total number of jobs created,"" Biden said in the Oct. 21 town hall hosted by CNN’s Anderson Cooper. We’ve looked at this claim multiple times during Biden’s presidency, but since time has passed, new jobs figures require us to make new calculations each time. So we’ve done that here. We found that the Biden administration has indeed overseen record-setting gains in jobs, as long as you measure them by raw numbers, which the last part of Biden’s sentence suggests is what he meant.  But this glosses over the fact that the total number of employed Americans has grown over time. And the comparison also ignores other important context. The official government data shows that between January 2021, when Biden took office, and September, the number of employed Americans rose from 142.7 million to 147.6 million, or a gain of nearly 5 million jobs. In numerical terms, that’s a bigger gain in jobs than for the equivalent period under every post-World War II president who first came to office in an election. (This comparison leaves out Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford, each of whom initially assumed the office without being elected.)   The closest competitor to Biden was Jimmy Carter, with a gain of 2.8 million jobs. However, Biden’s claim leaves out at least four important bits of context. Raw numbers vs. percentages. By choosing to highlight jobs gained as his metric, Biden has an advantage in a comparison with previous presidents. The U.S. population has grown, and so has the labor force. A fairer metric for comparison is the number of jobs gained divided by the starting level of jobs when the president took office. By this metric, Biden scores well, but he’s not No. 1. That distinction goes to Carter, who oversaw job gains of 3.5%, compared with Biden’s 3.4%.   Comparison to the pre-pandemic level. The U.S. economy is still about 5 million jobs below the pre-pandemic peak — 147.6 million jobs in September 2021, compared with 152.5 million jobs in February 2020.    The question of timing. Biden entered office during a recession (and a global pandemic), but while the economy was on the upswing. Most other presidents — aside from Barack Obama, who took office during a spiraling economic downturn — have entered the White House amid a growing economy. But what phase of expansion the economy is in at the precise moment of their inauguration can play a big role in how a president’s first months go economically. Since different presidents have been sworn in at different points in the economic cycle, Biden’s comparison to his predecessors is not really apples-to-apples. Who gets the credit? Experts always caution that a president is not all-powerful in economic matters, since many factors beyond their control, from international oil supplies to changes in technology and demographics, can shape the health of the U.S. economy. That said, experts say Biden deserves some credit for the job gains on his watch, given the expansion of coronavirus vaccinations and the passage of his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which provided coronavirus aid and economic relief. Biden said, ""We’ve created more jobs in the first eight months of my administration than any president in American history — total number of jobs created."" The raw numbers support Biden’s claim, but the talking point glosses over the reality that the U.S. economy remains about 5 million jobs under its pre-pandemic peak. It also ignores that adjusting for population growth would have made Carter first, rather than Biden. In addition, comparing presidents as Biden did is highly sensitive to the economic conditions around the time of their inauguration.

Democrats still coming up short with Walker-Kleefisch school funding cut claim
","There is an adage that if you repeat a statement enough times, it eventually will be accepted as true. But that’s not how we work around here. At PolitiFact Wisconsin, if you keep recycling the same claim, it’s not going to lead to a better rating. Instead, it’ll lead back to where we started. Consider a claim posted Sept. 13, 2021 on Instagram by the state Democratic Party of Wisconsin, in which they target Republican gubernatorial candidate Rebecca Kleefisch, who was lieutenant governor under Gov. Scott Walker before the pair were ousted in 2018: ""The Walker-Kleefisch administration slashed $800 million from public schools."" We clicked our way back through our files, and found this claim from a September 2018 campaign ad from now-Gov. Tony Evers, that Walker ""cut $800 million from our schools."" We wrote: In the ad, Evers claims Walker cut $800 million from schools. He did cut close to that ($784 million), in raw dollars in a single two-year budget. But that ignores changes made through Walker’s Act 10 that saved districts money. And the ad does not make clear that it’s referring only to cuts from 2011-’13, so viewers wouldn’t know that subsequent funding increases have made up most of that reduction. We rated it Mostly False. Going a little further back, there was also this claim, from April 2018 -- that despite a recent increase in school funding, Walker ""has taken over a billion dollars from the public schools.""  We wrote: In Walker’s first year as governor (2011), he cut school aid by $426.5 million from the previous year, which was Jim Doyle’s final year as governor. Because it took five years to get school funding back to that base level, it could be argued that Walker ""took"" a total of $1.17 billion from schools over that period. But since then, Walker had increased school funding to the point that the deficit, in comparison to the base year, was $183.6 million.  We also rated that claim Mostly False. So, what’s new this time? Not much. When asked to back up their claim, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin emailed a list of media reports that describe the same cuts and budget moves we mentioned above. For instance, they sent a June 27, 2011, article from WISN 12 News titled ""Walker's Budget Cuts $800 Million From Public Education."" But the very same article included comments from Walker that noted, as we did in our factcheck, there is another side to the equation -- money that districts could gain through Act 10. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin claimed that ""The Walker-Kleefisch administration slashed $800 million from public schools."" We have rated that claim before, when various Democrats tried to pin it solely on Walker. The same numbers and logic apply now: The Walker-Kleefisch administration did cut close to that amount ($784 million), in raw dollars in a single two-year budget.  But that ignores changes made through Walker’s Act 10 that saved districts money. And the fact that large chunks of the funding were restored over time. We rated the claim Mostly False then. We rate it the same way now.  ",/factchecks/2021/oct/22/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/democrats-still-coming-short-walker-kleefisch-scho/

Fluoride added to drinking water is safe and beneficial
","Fearmongering about fluoride in the water is nothing new, dating to the 1950s, but now there’s a modern-day method for doing it: social media. A viral Instagram post said two forms of fluoride in our drinking water ""are so toxic that the CDC clearly labels these chemicals extremely toxic in both animals and humans."" The post says, ""It’s hard to see what’s going on when you’re still drinking fluoridated water."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Fluoride and other substances — including salt, iron, vitamin D and chlorine — are safe in small amounts but can be toxic in very large amounts, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The amount of fluoride added to drinking water is not toxic. How much is a toxic dose? At the recommended fluoride levels to prevent tooth decay, an adult male who weighs 155 pounds would have to drink about 1,900 eight-ounce glasses of water — nearly 120 gallons — in one sitting in order to reach a toxic level of consumption, according to the American Dental Association. The CDC notes that ""exposure to higher levels of fluoride may harm your health,"" and ingesting extremely large amounts can cause death. Adding fluoride to the drinking water supply, sometimes called community water fluoridation, began in the U.S. in 1945 as a way of combating tooth decay, particularly in children. It’s considered to be a safe, cost-effective way to prevent cavities, and the CDC named community water fluoridation one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.  Fluoride is an element that occurs naturally in rivers, lakes, oceans, rocks and soil. Bodies of water in and around the U.S. have naturally occurring fluoride levels from 0.1 to 12 parts per million. The recommended level for preventing tooth decay is between 0.7 and 1.2 parts per million.  The types of fluoride added to drinking water typically are extracted from phosphate rock, and after the extraction, the rock is used to create fertilizer.  ""Opponents use this message a lot, maybe because they want to create the false impression that fluoride comes from fertilizer,"" according to the Campaign for Dental Health, a program of the American Academy of Pediatrics. In fact, the Instagram post also makes the claim that the ""two forms of fluoride that end up in our water...are by-products of the refining and fertilizer industries."" Another substance extracted from phosphate rock, phosphoric acid, is an ingredient in some Coca-Cola products. An Instagram post said two forms of fluoride in our drinking water ""are so toxic that the CDC clearly labels these chemicals extremely toxic in both animals and humans."" While fluoride can be toxic in massive amounts, the amount of fluoride added to drinking water is not toxic, and it would be impossible to drink enough of it to reach a toxic dose of fluoride. We rate this claim about drinking water False.   ",/factchecks/2021/oct/21/instagram-posts/fluoride-added-drinking-water-safe-and-beneficial/
"['Economy', 'Chuck Grassley']","
Inflation costs to consumers are real, with an explanation
","Iowa’s prodigious congressional tweeter, Republican U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, attempted to put inflation into terms Iowans and others could understand: via their pocketbooks. ""Welcome 2 Pres Biden’s America where inflation is costing households an extra $175 a month,"" he wrote on Twitter the evening of Tuesday, Oct. 19.  The twitterverse was quick to respond:  ""Take a rudimentary economics class,"" wrote one commenter who posted a graphic showing employment going up since Biden became president. (It is.) ""Actually old man ...i think maybe we're paying your bills,"" another wrote. (Taxpayers pay salary and benefits.) ""This is a lie,"" yet another wrote. Not quite, although Grassley’s source for the $175 per month says it applies to a salary of $70,000. It doesn’t apply for all households. ""My $175 per month is derived by the difference in current CPI inflation of over 5% and typical CPI inflation of over 2%, or 3 percentage points, times the median income of $70,000 and dividing by 12,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa. ""Pretty straightforward."" That extra 3 percentage points out of $70,000 equals $2,100 annually. Zandi said he estimated the current median household income, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Grassley pulled Zandi’s assessment from an Oct. 6 New York Post story, Grassley’s press office said. The Post story notes that inflation is at 30-year high, with no way to predict when it will go down because of uncertain supply-chain issues. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in October that prices for goods, housing and energy all rose from August to September. Grassley specifically was referencing Zandi’s analysis in his tweet, Grassley press secretary Katelyn Schultz wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa.  Knowing how Zandi calculated the additional cost burden is important because inflation’s impact on household spending power varies, depending upon salaries. While average hourly earnings increased 0.2% from August to September, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Oct. 13 that real -- that is, inflation-adjusted -- average hourly earnings were down 0.8% from what they were in September 2020. ""My calculated loss of spending power is consistent with the decline in real wages,"" Zandi wrote to PolitiFact Iowa. Disregarding the typical inflation rate when determining the loss of spending power could paint an even bleaker but inaccurate picture of what consumers could have expected from their dollars this year. When you add the unexpected 3 percentage points to the expected inflation of a little more than 2%, a consumer earning the median $70,000 in January would need $73,406.04 at the end of September for the same purchasing power. That amounts to $283.83 a month if the September 5.4% rate holds. Knowing the calculation also is important because of the political arguments that Republicans are making to pin the blame on President Joe Biden. PolitiFact has reported on this before. Economists said for a story at the end of July that recent large amounts of new government spending, which Republicans point to when pinning blame on Biden for inflation, started during the Trump Administration’s efforts to counteract COVID-19’s financial impact on the nation’s economy. Two-thirds of $3.4 trillion of the $4.7 trillion budgeted for COVID-19 relief had taken place during the Trump Administration, the PolitiFact analysis showed. We also reported at the beginning of July that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome H. Powell wanted analysts to have more information before knowing where inflation ultimately is headed. Two months had passed when Powell said in an Aug. 27 speech that inflation still was a cause for concern but likely to be temporary. On Sept. 28, Powell told the House Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee and, on Sept. 30, the House Financial Services Committee he still expects inflation to level out but that this may not happen until 2022. ""As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly due to supply bottlenecks in some sectors. These effects have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, but they will abate, and as they do, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer-run 2%,"" he said. Other factors come into play when assessing buying power. For example, more people have jobs now than in January. Gains have been made in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, retail trade, transportation and warehousing, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in October.  Unemployment dropped from 5.2% in August to 4.8% in September, the report said. But that still is higher than its pre-pandemic level in February 2020 of 3.5%, the report also said. Inflation in President Biden’s America is costing households an extra $175 a month, Sen. Chuck Grassley tweeted to his followers Oct. 19. Inflation is currently at an unusually high level, but the $175 per household figure, which was calculated by a credible economist, is for the median-income household, and the impact on other households could be higher or lower depending on total income earned. There are also a few caveats to note. The current level of inflation is not all traceable to Biden’s policies; some of the federal spending increases blamed for inflation were approved on a bipartisan basis during the pandemic and were signed by Trump. It’s also worth noting that wages have gone up modestly, helping households cope with some, but hardly all, of the increase in prices. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2021/oct/21/chuck-grassley/inflation-costs-consumers-are-real-explanation/

Old ‘clown purge’ warning spreads on social media again
","""Coulrophobia"" is a term that means an abnormal fear of clowns.  Not such an abnormal fear, you might think, if you saw a recent social media post warning about a clown purge on Oct. 30.  ""Warning,"" the post says. ""Clowns are allegedly planning their own purge the night before Halloween. Stay inside, keep all pets inside and keep all doors and windows locked. Share this post to show awareness to family and friends and anyone else who doesn’t really know about the clown purge spreading across towns and countries."" The warning isn’t explicit about what, exactly, a purge is. But for several years now, hoax threats about murderous purges à la the 2013 movie ""The Purge"" have spread online. In the movie, all crime is legal for 12 hours. But the warning in the Facebook post is at least five years old, and there’s no reason to believe it’s true. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Back in 2016, Snopes debunked the clown purge rumor that was being shared online — the exact same text that appears in this year’s social media posts. In 2017, the hoax included a fake Department of Homeland Security warning.  ""We have escalated these threats to acts of domestic terrorism and are working closely with the Department of Homeland Security to keep Americans safe,"" a supposed law enforcement officer is quoted as saying in a fake news story Snopes looked at that claimed schools businesses, and churches had received threats of a ""Halloween night purge.""  So many purge warnings, and yet news reports covering the purges themselves are pretty light — and that includes clown purges. Police in Greenville, S.C., said in 2016 that the clown purge rumor in that town wasn’t a credible threat. The New York Times reported that false clown reports that year were a ""contagion."" On top of that, Vox said, people were using the hoax as an excuse to scare people. One man was arrested in clown clothes and a mask in Kentucky, for example. In Australia in 2017, a man in a clown costume was sentenced for chasing a group of girls near a shopping center. Social media accounts such as ""Australian Clown Purge"" fueled some anxieties, but the user wrote that clowns ""don’t mean to harm anyone,"" and subsequent clown sightings appeared to be isolated.

No COVID-19 vaccination required to receive Social Security payments

On the floor, Scott mentioned a bill he introduced the same day to prohibit requiring that any individual be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a condition of receiving Social Security benefits.  Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., argued that the bill was proposed for political gain, because there is no effort to tie Social Security benefits to vaccinations.

This is not far-fetched. The Biden administration’s already doing it to companies and people that have a job. The Social Security system is meant to help those who have spent their lives working in this country and disability checks are designed to help those who cannot work. These checks are not a tool for government to impose its will on the people, just as it shouldn't be the position of the Biden administration to require companies to enforce a vaccine mandate.

Conservative group distorts voter registration section in Senate Democrats’ bill
","Senate Democrats are trying to rewrite national rules for voting, drawing attacks from conservatives who say state legislatures should be allowed to control the rules for registering voters and casting ballots. One Facebook post suggests two Democrat-backed efforts ""automatically registers ineligible voters."" ""Senate Democrats are continuing their crusade against election integrity this week,"" read the Oct. 19 post from Heritage Action, an affiliate of the conservative Heritage Foundation. The Senate voted 49-51 on Oct. 20 to debate the Freedom to Vote Act legislation, falling short of the needed votes to proceed. Republicans opposed the bill and Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer at the last minute changed his vote to ""no,"" a move that enables him to move that the legislation be reconsidered at some point in the future.  In its post, Heritage Action calls the Freedom to Vote Act the ""Freedom to Cheat Act"" and nicknames an earlier version, the For the People Act, as ""The Corrupt Politicians Act."" Both bills, the post says, would ""automatically register ineligible voters.""  These characterizations are wrong. While there is a provision in the Freedom to Vote Act that requires states to offer automatic voter registration, the goal is to make it easier for eligible citizens to register at their state motor-vehicle offices, and the wording in the bill repeatedly clarifies that only eligible citizens can vote in federal elections. We previously rated False a claim that the For the People Act would register millions of undocumented immigrants. The Freedom of the Vote Act wouldn’t do that either. ""States will not have to enroll ineligible voters,"" said Matthew Weil, an elections expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""The text of the bill clearly lays out that this is a process only for eligible individuals, and it’s a transfer of info from the DMV to election officials."" Automatic voter registration ""is less automatic than its detractors make it out to be,"" he said. The automatic voter registration provision in the Freedom to Vote Act would expand a practice that is already in place in more than one dozen states, including blue states such as California and red states such as West Virginia. The practice stems from the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, which required most states to provide citizens with an opportunity to register to vote when applying for or renewing a driver’s license at a DMV or  using services at other state agencies. In states that have adopted automatic voter registration, that ensures that the process is electronic and automatic.  While the legislation specifically applies to federal elections, as a practical matter states don’t use a separate process for registration for state elections, so the provision on automatic voter registration would apply broadly. This part of the legislation was written to take effect in January 2023.  Under the Freedom to Vote Act, citizens who access government services at a motor-vehicle agency would have their information automatically transferred for voter registration unless they decline to register. This is referred to as an ""opt out"" provision. The proposed legislation repeatedly says that automatic voter registration applies to eligible citizens.: The legislation states that the goal is to ""enable the state governments to register all eligible citizens to vote"" and to protect and enhance the integrity ""of the electoral process for all eligible citizens."" For agencies that request applicants to affirm United States citizenship, the agency ""shall inform each such individual who is a citizen"" that ""unless that individual declines to register to vote, or is found ineligible to vote, the individual will be registered to vote...."" The legislation expressly bars an agency from providing an opportunity to register to vote if the individual didn’t ""affirm United States citizenship"" or if the agency has evidence that ""the individual is not a United States citizen."" Within 10 days of a transaction with an ""eligible individual"" at the DMV, the agency shall electronically transmit information to state election officials including ""information showing that the individual is a citizen of the United States."" For any agency that does not request that individuals affirm citizenship, the legislation has a separate process. The bottom line is that the legislation doesn’t change the federal law that only eligible citizens are allowed to register to vote. Asked about the Facebook post, Noah Weinrich, a spokesperson for Heritage Action, said the bill’s opt-out system means it will ""inevitably include some ineligible voters like noncitizens who interact with agencies like the DMV. The bill does not contain adequate safeguards against registering ineligible voters."" As evidence, Weinrich pointed to concerns by immigration advocates. Advocates told NBC in April that they feared noncitizens in the country legally on work visas or green cards could inadvertently face serious consequences including deportation if the law led to them being mistakenly registered. Weinrich cited California as an example of how noncitizens can end up registered to vote through automatic voter registration. ABC News reported that as many as 1,500 noncitizens were registered, which officials traced back to a programming flaw. But the legislation states that noncitizens who end up registered to vote shall not be prosecuted or face immigration consequences if it was due to ""individual or agency error"" or did not make an affirmation of citizenship. We have found other examples of noncitizens registering or casting ballots. In 2017, Pennsylvania officials said they found 544 ballots potentially cast by noncitizens in elections dating back to 2000 — out of about 93 million ballots cast. That’s about 1 out of every 172,000 ballots. These glitches are rare and easily detectable and fixable, David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, previously told us.   ""Those are system glitches, technical problems that absolutely should be fixed. Proving citizenship would not fix them. They were problems in how the systems were designed and they were fixed,"" he said.  PolitiFact has previously debunked claims that falsely suggested widespread registering to vote or casting of ballots by noncitizens.  RELATED VIDEO Heritage Action said the Freedom to Vote Act ""automatically registers ineligible voters."" Heritage Action points to the automatic voter registration provision, which would forward individuals’ information from the DMV to state election officials unless they opt out of registering to vote. But this provision repeatedly states that only eligible citizens are allowed to register to vote. Noncitizens have wrongly ended up on voter registration rolls in states that have adopted automatic voter registration. But experts say such errors are rare, and could happen even without automatic voter registration. The post ignores the language of the law and goes too far by suggesting that the bill would automatically register ineligible voters.  We rate this statement False.

‘Transhumanism nanotechnology’ COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy theory is Pants on Fire
","A headline on a video widely shared on Facebook used multisyllabic words to make an alarming claim about the COVID-19 vaccines: ""Dr. Carrie Madej: Why Is RNA-Modifying Transhumanism-Nano-Technology Inside the COVID-19 Vaccines?"" The short answer to the question: It isn’t. The vaccines don’t contain any such thing. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s part of a baseless conspiracy theory about the vaccines being part of an effort to change humans through technology. ""None of the vaccines contain nanotechnology of any sort, let alone 'transhumanism nanotechnology,’ which isn’t even a thing,"" said Mark Lynas, a visiting fellow at the Alliance for Science and Cornell University.  Madej describes herself as an osteopathic internal medicine doctor who stands for ""freedom, truth, great love,"" and who is ""practicing the truth in Jesus through medicine."" She also indicates she is no longer practicing medicine, but rather ""dedicates her time to educating others on vaccines, nanotechnology and human rights."" Madej has made multiple claims about the COVID-19 vaccines that fact-checkers have rated false. In the 50-minute video, Madej described attending business owner meetings in metropolitan Atlanta several years ago in which the participants discussed ""transhumanism,"" which she said is ""taking the human body and making it better"" through methods such as ""genetic modification, nanotechnology, melding the human body with artificial intelligence.""  The COVID-19 vaccines, she suggested, are part of this effort. ""The people that are pushing these agendas"" are also ""pushing these injections on everybody around the world. They go hand in hand,"" she said. Their plan ""is to change what it is to be human, and their goal is 2030."" Madej said she viewed the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines with a compound microscope and observed indications of ""superconducting materials,"" or a ""liquified computing system.""  She also said she observed ""tentacle-like, spider-like organisms,"" and that people told her they were pond-water parasites. We rated as Pants on Fire claims that the Pfizer vaccine contains ""a deadly parasite"" and ""living particles"" that could germinate in the body. We can’t say what Madej was looking at under a microscope or what she saw. We messaged Madej on Facebook, but did not get a reply. Madej does not list contact information on her website or on her Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts. We called two phone numbers listed online for her; neither were working. The only links between Madej’s description of the vaccine and what’s actually in it are the term ""RNA"" and the prefix ""nano."" RNA — ribonucleic acid — is a molecule similar to DNA that carries coded genetic information to a cell. The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use a form called messenger RNA, or mRNA, to carry genetic information about the coronavirus to the body’s cells to teach the immune system to identify and prepare to fight off a COVID-19 infection. It does not modify a person’s DNA or RNA.  The mRNA technology dates to the 1990s, though this is the first time it has been used in widely disseminated vaccines.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine does not use mRNA. Instead, it uses a disabled adenovirus to deliver instructions to help the body recognize the coronavirus’ spike proteins and activate the immune system.  Lynas at Cornell said mRNA vaccines ""have proven incredibly safe and effective and the technology is also looking promising for many other diseases and cancer."" The term ""nano"" is widely used to describe things that are very small, such as iPods and cars, but scientists use the prefix more specifically to refer to things on the scale of individual atoms.  Nanotechnology, says the National Nanotechnology Initiative, is the ""application of extremely small things"" for uses in fields such as chemistry, biology and physics. These can be structures or even tiny machines.  In the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the mRNA is contained in a ""lipid bubble,"" or a shell of fat, that’s described as a nanoparticle. That just means it’s very small. That doesn’t make it nanotechnology.  ""Even though the term is used here to imply that nanotechnology is being used to modify your RNA, that is completely false,"" said Cindy Prins, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida. ""The mRNA in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines doesn’t have any effect on one’s DNA or RNA. It doesn’t become a permanent part of the cell."" Prins said Madej’s explanation of what she says she observed ""is ridiculous. She says she is using a compound microscope, which can be used to look at cells or bacteria, but certainly will not show nano-scale structures."" Transhumanism is the belief in changing and enhancing the human body through technology.   Lynas said ""there are people who believe we should try to transcend human biology and upload human consciousness to computers — but they are a fairly marginal group and don’t have anything to do with vaccine developers, in my knowledge."" Prins said: ""I have been vaccinated and can guarantee that the only modification I have is immunity to COVID-19."" Madej said the COVID-19 vaccines contain ""RNA-modifying transhumanism nanotechnology."" There is no evidence that the three vaccines used in the U.S. contain any such thing. Two of the vaccines use mRNA technology that does not change the body’s DNA or RNA or alter humans permanently.
