Milwaukee County executive candidate Jim Sullivan says police have to wait for hours with mental health patients
","
During a two-month period in 2004, more than 60 people with mental health emergencies waited for up to 60 hours to get treatment at the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex. Some had to be kept under police guard until they could receive care.

In early 2008, police agencies continued to rack up thousands of dollars in overtime as officers waited in their squad cars or in hospital emergency rooms with patients who needed psychiatric crisis services.

According to Jim Sullivan, one of the five candidates running in the Feb. 15, 2011, primary election for Milwaukee County executive, the problem persists.

In a Jan. 31, 2011 meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editors and reporters, Sullivan responded to a question about the Mental Health Complex by saying:

""When they’re full up over there, our local police officers -- if you’ve got somebody who needs to be over at mental health because they’re mentally ill, they may pose a danger to themselves, any of these different things -- if it’s full, cops sit out there in their squad cars with a mentally ill patient in the back and they have to wait to unload and people will, in some cases, spend an entire shift out there doing that.""

If Sullivan is right, police officers are regularly experiencing hours-long delays at the Mental Health Complex when transporting someone who needs crisis services.

Is he right?

We asked Sullivan, a former Democratic state senator from Wauwatosa, the basis for his statement. He did not have any direct evidence, but said he heard the Wauwatosa and West Allis police departments experienced such waits.

Thousands of people each year receive crisis care at the complex, 9455 W. Watertown Plank Road. Some are admitted to the 96-bed facility but most are treated and released.

As Sullivan indicated, crisis patients are brought to the facility, often by police, because they are deemed a danger to themselves or others.

The Journal Sentinel’s Patients in Peril investigation has uncovered numerous problems at the complex, from bungled care of patients and staff members falsifying documents to skyrocketing overtime costs.

But delays faced by police officers transporting crisis patients have not been in the news recently.

What’s more, Sullivan’s claim about delays is contradicted by an October 2010 study by a national consulting firm, which found that changes made by the county ""have been very effective in reducing backups.""

The finding was reiterated by the Milwaukee-based Public Policy Forum research organization in a January 2011 report, which summarized issues for candidates in the county executive race.

That report relied, in part, on a November 2010 county memo that showed a dramatic reduction in police waits beginning in 2008.

To further check Sullivan’s statement, we contacted the two police departments he cited as well as the Milwaukee Police Department and the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office.

Here is what they told us:

Wauwatosa police: Long delays ended five or more years ago and current wait times are usually less than 30 minutes, said Capt. Jeff Sutter. ""It would be extremely unusual for us to have what I consider a long wait,"" he said.

West Allis police: Long waits ended three years ago, according to Chief Mike Jungbluth, who said his officers transport patients to the Mental Health Complex ""every day.""

Milwaukee police: ""We aren’t experiencing the issue anymore,"" said spokeswoman Anne E. Schwartz.

Milwaukee County sheriff:  Deputies usually wait about 20 minutes, said Capt. Darlene Jonas. If several officers are trying to get patients treated, the wait time could be one to two hours, she said.

So what’s the bottom line?

Sullivan said delays in admitting people to the Mental Health Complex for crisis care can be so long that police officers spend up to an entire shift with patients waiting for them to receive treatment. Hours-long delays were a problem some years ago. But the four largest police agencies in the county now say waits are short.   

Perhaps there are isolated cases today in which officers waits for hours, but at minimum Sullivan’s claim is clearly dated.

Gov. Rick Perry says state Medicaid proposal has ""languished"" in federal file cabinet for years
","
It's no secret that Texas Gov. Rick Perry thinks states can do some things better than the federal government, including coordinating health care for its poorest residents. 
In a Dec. 19 interview with Kathleen McKinley, whose blog appears on the Houston Chronicle's website, Perry said the state has good ideas for delivering care effectively. As an example, he pointed to a proposal that Texas submitted to the federal government with the goal of reducing the number of uninsured residents by ""restructuring federal Medicaid funding."" Medicaid uses federal and state funding to provide health insurance to low-income Americans. 
Perry went on: ""Unfortunately, this waiver, which presents a strategic alternative to continued reliance on government-run health care programs, has languished in a file cabinet at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for more than two years."" 
Perry's description of the waiver proposal's status rang a bell here at PolitiFact Texas. In the spring, we rated as False a statement Perry made in an April 15 interview with the Texas Tribune and Newsweek magazine that Texas has been waiting for more than two years for the federal government to act on a proposal to allow the state to ""create insurance opportunities for those that are uninsured today."" 
We confirmed that Texas had sought permission from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in April 2008 to redirect Medicaid hospital funds into a state pool intended to help some low-income Texans get private insurance. However, in August 2008, during George W. Bush's presidency, an official with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of the federal health agency, sent a letter to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission stating that ""a number of areas under this proposal have been identified as problematic"" — making it impossible for the federal agency to approve the proposal as written. 
Since then, state and federal officials have gone back and forth, without the state submitting a revised proposal and with no ultimate resolution. A federal official told us April 22 that the ball was in the state's court, saying that as of that time, the waiver request wasn't considered complete. 
Our story also quoted a state official saying that the proposal would probably need to be adjusted afresh to the just-approved federal overhaul of health care. 
Eight months later, Perry appeared to be making the same claim, that the federal government — not the state — was responsible for the waiver request's stalled-out status. We wondered whether anything had changed since we last investigated this topic. 
Not from the state's perspective. ""We still consider the proposal to be pending,"" said Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Texas health commission. 
Not from the view of the federal government, which still considers the proposal incomplete. Mary Kahn, a spokeswoman for CMS, told us that the agency had ""not yet received a revised proposal from the state."" She declined to comment on Perry's statement that it's languishing in a file cabinet. 
Perry's office did not respond to phone calls and e-mails seeking elaboration on the governor's recent characterization. 
Summing up: Perry’s statement echoes a claim we rated False eight months ago. Significantly, the state has not revised its request to meet federal requirements, making this rerun worse than inaccurate.

MetroParks Commissioner Dan Moore knows his canal history
","
When Cuyahoga County Probate Court Judge Anthony J. Russo started 2011 by appointing entrepreneur Dan T. Moore III to the Cleveland Metroparks Board, he cited Moore's knowledge of the Towpath Trail as one key factor.

The original Towpath Trail -- constructed 175 years ago as part of the Ohio & Erie Canal -- was  a simple dirt path on which mules walked to tow canal boats. The modern-day version is a multi-purpose trail of asphalt and crushed limestone open to hikers, cyclists and, in some sections, horseback riders.

When completed, the trail will stretch 101 miles from the Lake Erie shore in Cleveland to New Philadelphia. More than 80 miles are done. Obstacles including railroad tracks and industrial contamination have made it difficult to complete the remaining fragments in Cleveland, Akron and Barberton.

Moore, who rides the trail regularly, called it ""a wonderful, magical and phenomenal resource.

""Unfortunately,"" he said, ""it's taken more time to complete the Towpath Trail than it did to build the Canal, and that's tragic. We need to cut through the politics. I think less talk and more doing is a good idea.""

That caught the attention of PolitiFact Ohio. We knew that completing the Towpath Trail became more of a marathon than a walk in the park. But has it really taken longer to complete than it took to build the original canal?

We thought it might be a good time for a brief history lesson.

The Ohio & Erie Canal was 308 miles long. Its main channels were 26 feet wide at the base and 40 feet wide at the water line.

It was built before the steam shovel was invented, so to construct the canal, laborers had to chop a path through the forest and then dig it using picks, shovels and wheelbarrows.

The work started in 1825. It was finished in 1832 -- or, says the Ohio Historical Commission, ""by 1833.""

The National Park Service started work on the Towpath Trail in the mid-1980s, a decade after President Gerald Ford signed the bill establishing the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. The trail’s first segment -- a stretch through the park of nearly 20 miles -- opened in 1993.

Completion of the trail in Cuyahoga County  is now scheduled for 2014, according to the Cuyahoga County Planning Commission. The Cleveland Metroparks will handle day-to-day maintenance and security for the trail, and city of Cleveland will own the land under it.

The Ohio & Erie Canalway Coalition says its goal is to complete the full Towpath Trail, from Cleveland to New Philadelphia, by 2020.

Adding it all up, work on the Towpath Trail started no later than 1990. The portion within Cuyahoga County -- which is the portion involving Cleveland Metroparks -- is scheduled to be finished in 2014. That’s a span of 24 years.

Construction of the canal that the original towpath once serviced took seven years.

We rate Moore’s statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB64A00>],/factchecks/2011/jan/06/dan-moore/metroparks-commissioner-dan-moore-knows-his-canal-/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'History', 'Kevin McCarthy']","
Kevin McCarthy says 111th Congress spent more in two years than the first 100 congresses combined
","
In a recent Q&A feature called, ""Ask the Californian,"" reader Gerald Sutliff wrote the Bakersfield Californian newspaper to ask why his Congressman, Republican Kevin McCarthy, did not cast a vote on several key bills during the busy lame-duck session of the 111th Congress. 
""One can't help noting that last week's vote recap (How our Lawmakers Voted) shows our congressman (Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield) missing in action,"" Sutliff wrote. ""It's OK with me; he may have had a good reason. However, I really want to know his view on each of the votes he missed. How would he have voted had he been present?"" The four bills in question were one to provide assistance to 9/11 responders, one to update food safety laws, one to reauthorize a science education bill known as the America Competes Act and one to temporarily extend government spending. 
McCarthy's office issued a statement that was published on Jan. 2, 2011. 
""I was not present for the votes because my son had surgery last week, and I came home to be with him and my family,"" said McCarthy, who will be the House Majority Whip in the new Congress. ""If I had been in D.C., I would have voted against all of the bills mentioned in your reader's letter. While there were a number of positive things in each of the bills, the tipping point was the spending. The Democratic majority led the 111th Congress to spend more money in two years than the first 100 congresses before them combined. Washington has lost touch and spent too much time focusing on the wrong issues. Americans need jobs, not more debt, and next year the new majority will be focused on just that."" 
The portion of McCarthy's comment that caught our eye was where he said that ""the Democratic majority led the 111th Congress to spend more money in two years than the first 100 congresses before them combined."" 
The reason? A few months earlier, we gave a Pants on Fire ruling to a very similar statement by Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va. (He and McCarthy are two of the three lawmakers who have labeled themselves the ""Young Guns"" in the House GOP leadership.) 
In the earlier comment, during the Oct. 12, 2010, episode of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, Cantor told Jon Stewart that ""what you've seen (in Washington) is a crowd that has taken advantage of a crisis back in late '08, early '09 and spent more money than this country has spent in the last 200 years combined, in the two years since."" 
Stewart didn't challenge Cantor's claim, but we did. 
We found that federal spending in those two years amounted to a little more than $7.2 trillion. We didn't have to add up all 200 years to exceed that amount -- you only had to add together 2006, 2007 and 2008 to reach $8.3 trillion, which exceeded the $7.2 trillion of 2009 and 2010. Cantor was also far off using more lenient calculations. Thus the Pants on Fire rating. 
When Cantor saw our analysis published by PolitiFact Virginia, he proceeded to write a letter to the editor in which he owned up to misspeaking and that he was referring to accumulated debt instead of spending. 
  
So what about McCarthy's statement? It's similar to Cantor's comment to Jon Stewart, but it's not exactly the same. Whereas Cantor used as his comparison point ""the last 200 years,"" McCarthy used ""the first 100 congresses."" Although his phrasing could be read to mean the 100 congresses prior to the 111th Congress, we're giving him the benefit of the doubt that he meant the first 100 congresses in history. That means counting only from the 1st Congress to the 100th Congress -- a period that ended 22 years ago, in January 1989. But he's wrong by either measure. 
McCarthy spokeswoman Erica Elliott forwarded us a Dec. 27, 2010, article from the conservative website CSNNews.com that looked at this question. The 111th Congress convened on Jan. 6, 2009, and exited on Dec. 22, 2010, a period in which the gross federal debt increased from $10.6 trillion to $13.9 trillion, a rise of $3.2 trillion. (There's an alternate measure of debt -- public debt -- that doesn't count the money that one part of the government lends to another part of the government, but the difference in the two figures is modest, so for simplicity, we'll stick with gross federal debt here.) 
Meanwhile, CNSNews tracked down a document showing that the gross federal debt reached $3.22 trillion in September 1990, a date that came during the 101st Congress. Thus the focus on the first 100 Congresses. 
The bottom line: If McCarthy had referred to debt rather than spending, he would have been correct. But he didn't, which is why the statement published in the Californian is incorrect. 
In the meantime, we'll add a few broader concerns with the relevance of McCarthy's comparison. 
• Inflation, economic growth and population. Since a dollar is worth far less today than it was in the early 1800s, you can't genuinely compare dollar amounts across time without making a mathematical adjustment. That's especially true when the time frame of the comparison ends in 1989, leaving off the 22 years most heavily influenced by cumulative inflation. Similarly, from year to year, the economy and population both tend to grow. It's only natural that as the size of the population grows and more money is available to spend, more money will be spent in an absolute sense. 
• How do you assign responsibility for spending increases? A sizable chunk of current spending was set on its course because of actions taken under President George W. Bush and the Republican Congress (such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit) -- not to mention programs passed under prior GOP presidents and Congresses. This doesn't mean Obama and the Democratic Congress bear no responsibility for the rise in spending. They just don't deserve all the blame. 
Ultimately, McCarthy's statement in the Californian was slightly less wrong than Cantor's statememt to Jon Stewart, since the ""first 100 congresses"" formulation is ultimately more supportable than ""the last 200 years combined."" Still, McCarthy made the same error that Cantor, his fellow Young Gun, did a couple months earlier -- confusing annual spending for accumulated debt. And that's enough to rule McCarthy's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA7B600>],/factchecks/2011/jan/05/kevin-mccarthy/kevin-mccarthy-says-111th-congress-spent-more-mone/

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett says 125 jobs have been already created through Milwaukee Job Corps Center
","
The  Milwaukee Job Corps Center didn’t open for business until Jan. 3, 2011.

But six weeks earlier, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett suggested the education and job-training facility had already become a major job creator.

""The Job Corps is both preparing the next generation of workers and providing jobs for current workers,"" Barrett said in a newsletter published Nov. 19, 2010. ""The first students will arrive in January. The center is expected to be at capacity with 300 students by the end of June. To date, more than 125 jobs have been created.""

That sounds impressive.

But jobs already created through a center that wasn’t yet open -- and is aimed at job training, not job creation?

We decided to get to the bottom of it all.

Job Corps is a 46-year-old federal program funded by Congress and administered by the U.S. Department of Labor. The program provides free education and training to more than 100,000 low-income people ages 16 to 24 at 124 locations around the country. Students can earn a high school diploma or GED, get specific vocational training and get help in finding jobs. Jobs Corps cost $1.68 billion in 2009.

How well does it work? The Labor Department’s most recent assessment, which examined performance in 2008, found mixed results on two major goals: 

Milwaukee applied for a Job Corps Center in 1993 but didn’t win the federal funding until 2003. The city’s $28 million facility, built on 25 acres on the former Bacher Farm on the city’s northwest side, opened for 14 students the first week of January 2011, said James Roberts, the center director.

Most will live in dormitories on the campus, where they will get free room and board, and some clothing. For most students, the education and training run for at least 8 1/2 months, but can run for as long as three years.

That means it will be about September before any will be ready for jobs.

So what about the 125 jobs Barrett said have been created?

According to Roberts, they are all federally funded staff positions at the Job Corps facility itself, everything from instructors and career counselors to cooks and custodians. Nearly all the positions are full-time and most have been filled.

When politicians announce job creations, the public typically thinks of new jobs in the private sector, but that’s not the case here.

In this case, there are 125 taxpayer-funded jobs that have been added to run the Job Corps Center. But the center itself doesn’t create jobs; it trains people for jobs. And it likely will not have trained anyone to be ready for work until late 2011.  

For our work on this item, it’s time to call it a day.

Even before the Milwaukee Job Corps Center opened, Mayor Tom Barrett touted the fact ""more than 125 jobs have been created."" There are about 125 new jobs as a result of the new facility -- those needed to run the center. However, the facility itself is not aimed at job creation, but job training -- and it isn’t expected to have trained any students to be ready for jobs until at least September.

Economist says state can do little for short-term job growth
","
Georgians need jobs. Last election season, that's just what politicians promised.

Gov.-elect Nathan Deal's commercials focused on bringing ""real jobs for real people."" His Democratic foe, former Gov. Roy Barnes, said he would put the state ""back to work.""

But during a boot camp for state legislators in December, prominent economist David Wyss said there's little Georgia government can do to kick-start the labor market for the near term.  

""It doesn’t work well on the state level because states can’t run budget deficits,"" Wyss said in a Dec. 13 article in The Florida Times-Union. He is chief economist for the credit rating company Standard & Poor's.

""So anything you do in reducing taxes has to come back with a reduction in spending, which basically wipes out any stimulus you get,"" he said

Really? But what about all those promises politicians made?

Jobs were a central issue during the elections. A poll conducted before the primaries for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other papers found that across party, gender and racial lines, Georgians were worried about their economic futures.

Three in four had qualms about their household finances and job security.

Georgians still have good reason to be anxious. Unemployment hovered just above 10 percent in November, according to the state Department of Labor. 

Wyss also spoke during a biennial conference of state legislators sponsored by the University of Georgia. The meeting updated lawmakers on the issues they face starting Monday, when the 2011 legislative session begins.

We called Wyss, who stressed that state government can enact policies that foster long-term job growth. They can train a work force specifically suited for a business's needs, for instance, or collaborate with local universities to foster technological innovation.

States such as Georgia also have agencies specifically charged with economic development. And governors have been known to go on trade missions.

But those efforts, too, are aimed at creating jobs in the long term.
Wyss was talking about the short term. And in the short term, state legislators and governors don't have many options.

Georgia and other states have to balance their budgets -- it's a constitutional requirement in Georgia. So if the state decides to cut taxes to stimulate business growth, it has to come up with the lost revenue somewhere else, Wyss said.

That means government spending cuts. It could even mean layoffs.

""There's no free lunch here,"" Wyss said.

AJC PolitiFact Georgia asked seven experts with wide-ranging perspectives for their input. For the most part, they agreed with Wyss' assessment.

Kelly McCutchen, president of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a Libertarian-influenced think tank, called the idea ""absolutely correct."" If a state spends money to spur job growth, lawmakers have to make cuts elsewhere.

Jon Shure, deputy director of the State Fiscal Project for the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, agreed with Wyss as well.

""Short-term job gains are dictated mostly by the economy. And those are mostly regional, national and global issues,"" Shure said.

One slight exception was Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. He said tax cuts could bring a ""marginal"" improvement in the short term and are worth trying, but they can't bring a big boost. 

""There is no magic wand,"" Riedl said.  

We found that experts placed the state's ability to create jobs for the short term between limited and marginal. None argued that state government could cause an immediate, major gain.

We find Wyss' statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC6B480>],/factchecks/2011/jan/05/david-wyss/economist-says-state-can-do-little-short-term-job-/

Michael McCaul says he stopped requesting earmarks in 2008
","
In an e-mail newsletter, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, celebrated the defeat of an annual spending bill that Senate Republicans refused to support. 
""Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid tried to pass a proposed omnibus budget bill with 6,714 earmarks worth $8.3 billion, but pulled it after Americans became outraged that Washington is not listening to their cries to stop pork barrel spending,"" McCaul said in the Dec. 20 e-mail. ""I am proud that I stopped requesting earmarks in 2008 until the system becomes 100 percent transparent."" 
Republican lawmakers have lately been swearing off earmarks — funding for local projects that lawmakers slip into spending bills — so we wondered if McCaul's own hands have been pork-free since 2008. 
First, we turned to databases of earmarks from fiscal 2008 to 2011 created by the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that is critical of earmarks. Prior to 2007, when the House tightened disclosure rules, lawmakers weren't required to attach their names to earmark requests. 
According to the 2008 database, McCaul joined other lawmakers in securing 19 earmarks worth $19.96 million in 2007. Alone, McCaul sponsored five earmarks totaling $1.72 million. He requested $200,000 for the City of Austin and $900,000 for an Imaging Research Center in Austin, among others. But according to the databases and Taxpayers for Common Sense spokesman Steve Ellis, McCaul hasn't requested any earmarks since. 
Mike Rosen, a spokesman for McCaul, passed along an April 2008 op-ed column by the congressman in which he said he was joining 35 colleagues in not ""requesting earmarks until meaningful, common sense reforms are made."" 
The op-ed, published in the Houston Chronicle, suggests that each earmark be brought to the floor and voted on; currently, they're added to legislation and usually passed without debate. 
In his 2008 op-ed, McCaul noted that while most earmarks ""are legitimate, and submitted by politicians who earnestly want to help the largest number of people by finding meaningful and worthwhile requests ... the lack of transparency and accountability in the process have bloated already unprecedented government spending and led to well publicized abuses like the infamous Alaskan 'bridge to nowhere.' In 2005, Alaska's Congressional delegation secured about $230 million to build a bridge to an island of 50 people. 
In a March press release responding to the Senate's defeat of a proposed earmark moratorium, McCaul reiterated his position, saying he wouldn't request earmarks until it's ""100 percent transparent as to the sponsor and recipient and until each earmark is subject to an up and down vote on the House floor.""  
The New York Times reported in December that while some lawmakers have denounced earmarks, they haven't necessarily stopped seeking money for special projects. The Washington-based Citizens Against Government Waste obtained a letter to the Department of Education from Rep. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., asking the agency to release money ""needed to support students and educational programs"" in a local school district that later said it received about $1 million in stimulus aid, according to the Times. 
Rosen told us that McCaul ""routinely writes letters of support for entities"" in his district that are ""applying for federal competitive grants."" Such agencies include the Department of Justice, Health and Human Services and the Department of Energy, Rosen said in an e-mail, ""for projects that range in scope from alternative energy to law enforcement to health and domestic violence programs."" 
""The funding sought is already budgeted by each agency for eligible projects and the grants are awarded based on set criteria established by law,"" Rosen said. 
Ellis told us that he wouldn't call that earmarking, because ""the agency is still making the decision. When you have an earmark in a piece of legislation, it subverts the agency decision-making process."" 
Upshot: McCaul stopped requesting earmarks in spending bills as of 2008. That's True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC6B0C0>],/factchecks/2011/jan/05/michael-mccaul/michael-mccaul-says-he-stopped-requesting-earmarks/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Medicare', 'Darrell Issa']","
Rep. Darrell Issa claims government could save $125 billion by not paying improper Medicare claims
","
Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., promises to be a politician we're going to hear a lot from this year.

Issa is the incoming chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He has pledged an aggressive agenda of hearings to ferret out government fraud and waste. And he called President Obama's White House ""one of the most corrupt administrations."" So he's going to be busy.

On CBS's Face the Nation on Jan. 2, 2011, Issa put a dollar figure on his goal, vowing to identify and eliminate about $200 billion in waste.

Medicare alone, he said, accounts for $125 billion in waste and fraud annually.

Said Issa: ""We can save $125 billion in simply not giving out money to Medicare recipients that don't exist for procedures that didn't happen. These are real dollars. Ten percent of the deficit goes out in wasted money, money that doesn't get one person health care in Medicare.""

We called the Oversight committee's press office to find out where Issa got the $125 billion figure and were told it came from an Office of Management and Budget report that concluded there was about $125 billion worth of ""improper payments"" in 2010. Improper payments include money paid to the wrong person (sometimes people who are dead or in jail), or in the wrong amount or for the wrong purpose, or payments for which there wasn't proper documentation. It also includes fraudulent claims by contractors and organizations.

But the OMB's total was government-wide, not just for Medicare. The $125 billion also included improper payments for programs including Medicaid, food stamps, unemployment insurance, Social Security and the school lunch program. Medicare is the government agency with the largest chunk of improper payments, but it's still less than half the total. In fact, improper payments in Medicare came to $47.9 billion ($34.3 billion in Medicare fee-for-service and $13.6 billion in Medicare Advantage). That's a significant amount of money but far less than the $125 billion Issa assigned entirely to Medicare.

It's also inaccurate to suggest that all of the money identified as improper payments could be returned as savings to taxpayers.

As Issa said, improper payments can include money paid to the wrong person or for procedures that didn't happen. But there's more to it than that. About a third of Medicare's improper payments are the result of a claim not having enough, or proper, documentation. Upon further investigation, many of those claims are ultimately deemed proper. One example is a payment based on a claim by a doctor who submits forms that are illegible.

Also, not all improper claims can be completely recouped. For example, say a surgeon was paid $10,000 for an inpatient procedure when Medicare only reimburses for an outpatient procedure that costs $5,000. The government wouldn't recoup the full $10,000, just the $5,000.

In other words, the government wouldn't end up with $125 billion even if all improper payments were eliminated for all those services, including Medicare.   

The Obama administration has taken a number of steps aimed at reducing improper payments.

With regard to Medicare specifically, Obama announced on June 8, 2010, the administration's intent to cut the improper payment rate in the Medicare fee-for-service program in half by 2012, eliminating more than $20 billion in payment errors. The Office of Management and Budget report cited by Issa's office notes that improper payments in the Medicare fee-for-service program actually went down in 2010 as a percentage, from 12.4 percent to 10.5 percent.

There's no question improper payments in Medicare are a very significant problem. But Issa has overstated the potential savings in the Medicare program. For starters, the report on which Issa based the $125 billion figure shows that the Medicare portion of that total is $47.9 billion. That alone makes Issa's figure simply wrong. But in addition, Issa wrongly suggests that all of the money from ""improper payments"" can be ""saved"" by simply not making those payments. In fact, a good portion of that money lacked proper documentation, but upon further investigation, may very well be verified as proper. In other words, even the $47.9 billion in improper payments in Medicare could not be fully recaptured for taxpayers. We rate Issa's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEEAB80>],/factchecks/2011/jan/04/darrell-issa/rep-darrell-issa-claims-government-could-save-125-/

Wisconsin Rep. Jeff Stone says he never proposed privatizing Mitchell International Airport
","
Wisconsin state Rep. Jeff Stone (R-Greendale) was a state lawmaker working on transportation issues when he unveiled a plan to put Mitchell International Airport under the control of an appointed airport authority -- and take control away from Milwaukee County government.

Now, five years later, Stone is running for Milwaukee County executive -- and his failed attempt to create regional airport control is back in the news.

Stone’s campaign kickoff on Dec. 15, 2010 didn’t include any major pronouncements, but in questions from reporters the privatizing claim popped up.

""I never proposed privatizing the airport,"" Stone said, responding to a question. ""What we looked at was a regional operation for the airport"" to enhance job and business growth in the area.

With the executive’s race getting fired up, we decided to look into Stone’s statement.

When he pushed for an appointed regional authority to govern Mitchell, Stone and a top aide said he was acting on behalf of some in Milwaukee’s business community.

Business leaders have long wanted to ensure that eventual airport expansion could proceed and that day-to-day airport operations could be divorced from Milwaukee County Board politics. More than one-fourth of airports in the country are governed by an independent board.

At the time, critics -- notably elected officials representing citizens living near the airport -- hit Stone hard. They revealed the fact airport authority backers, including a Stone aide, secretly met with business officials to draft a plan to spin the airport off from the county. They pointed out the airport’s reputation as a well-run, financially self-sufficient enterprise.

County Supervisor Marina Dimitrijevic, in remarks echoed by her then-colleague Richard Nyklewicz, accused Stone of seeking to ""privatize"" Mitchell ""by handing over management to an unaccountable, appointed board.""

Stone, then and now, vehemently denies that his support for an airport authority constitutes ""privatization.""

So who’s right?

The legislation Stone co-authored would have taken Mitchell out of direct public control of county government. Notably, the bill he introduced prohibited the governor and county executive from putting politicians or government employees on the board that would control the airport authority.

Around the country, some airport authorities have elected official representation and some do not, three experts told PolitiFact Wisconsin.

It’s also clear that the intent was to give airlines -- private companies -- much greater sway over airport affairs. A ""business first mentality,"" is how Stone aide Mike Pyritz described the idea in an interview.

Additionally, as head of a 2006 state legislative study committee on airport authorities, Stone invited testimony from Reason Institute transportation researcher Robert Poole, who had just released a study saying that a long-term lease of Mitchell to a private operator could reap hundreds of millions of dollars.

But we could find no evidence that Stone ever got behind the notion of leasing or selling Mitchell to a private operator, nor was that approach included in his airport authority bill.

It was, in fact, the Milwaukee County Board that, in 2006, launched a study of the privatization possibilities.

Even if Stone’s bill had passed in Madison, the airport still would have been owned by Milwaukee County, albeit with greater private influence. The airport authority would have been a government creation run by appointees of elected officials.

Similar, though not identical, examples abound in Wisconsin under the general label of quasi-governmental entities, including the Wisconsin Center District, whose political appointees run the Frontier Airlines Center in downtown Milwaukee.

Richard Abelson, a top Milwaukee public-sector union official, served on the 2006 state legislative study committee on airport authorities that Stone chaired. Abelson is an opponent of airport authorities, and is wary of moves that could lead to outsourcing of airport jobs.

He says Stone’s proposal did not amount to privatization. That, Abelson said, would mean leasing the airport to a private operator.

""He got tagged with misinformation,"" Abelson said of Stone, adding ""some people considered an authority a first step toward privatization.""

Debby McElroy, executive vice president of Airports Council International, the trade association for airports, agreed that privatization was not at issue in the Milwaukee case. Two experienced airline lease negotiators at Leigh/Fisher, an aviation management consulting firm, also said privatization was not the right word to describe Stone’s proposal.

Let’s bring this one in for a landing.

Stone says he did not support privatizing Mitchell International Airport.

Stone’s airport proposal would have created a quasi-public governance structure at Mitchell International Airport. A significant change, to be sure. But his approach stopped far short of turning the airport over to a private concern. Even a leading union official for Milwaukee County employees says calling the plan ""privatization"" overshoots the runway.

We rate Stone’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7078C0>],/factchecks/2011/jan/04/jeff-stone/wisconsin-rep-jeff-stone-says-he-never-proposed-pr/
"['Georgia', 'Kasim Reed']","
Numbers show support for Reed's claim about Atlanta finances
","
Federal, state and local leaders are constantly searching for every spare dollar or threatening to raise taxes to keep things running in this sluggish economy.

So it surprised us when Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed made this claim when discussing his first-year accomplishments:

""When I came in, the reserves of the city of Atlanta were $7.4 million,"" Reed said in a speech to the YMCA Hungry Club lunch forum on Nov. 30. ""As I stand here ... the reserves of the city of Atlanta are in excess of $56 million.""

How did the city get this done? Are the city's numbers correct?

Atlanta, like most governments, has several accounts to manage its finances. The main account the city uses to pay for most services (police, fire, parks and recreation) is called the ""general fund."" Some city services, such as water and sewer service, are paid through different funds. The general fund, which currently has a budget of about $560 million, is paid for through a combination of property taxes, sales taxes, business licenses, a hotel/motel tax it shares with state government, permits, court fines and other sources.

Atlanta's budget year, which the city calls ""fiscal year,"" begins July 1 and ends June 30. For the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2009, the city says it had a reserve fund of about $7.4 million. For the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2010, the mayor says the city's general fund reserve is at least $56 million. Some city data show the total is $58 million, which drew Reed some praise from New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman in a Christmas Day column.

So how does the city say it got there?

It began in June 2009, when the City Council voted 8-7 to put $27 million in its general fund reserve and raised property taxes by about $240 for the average city homeowner. Then-Mayor Shirley Franklin and her staff felt the city eventually needed a rainy day fund of about $100 million to protect the city if the economy falters, in hopes of avoiding what happened in 2008, when Atlanta, after feeling the first ripples of the recession, laid off several hundred employees and cut back a host of services. Skyrocketing employee pension costs, falling revenue from the recession and some bad long-standing budgeting practices were found to be the primary culprits of the financial troubles at City Hall.

A key moment in building its reserves took place in the early months of 2009. The Franklin administration was conservative in its estimates of how much it would receive in revenue during fiscal year 2010. It expected scores of property owners to appeal their assessments, said Duriya Farooqui, a top city official under Franklin who is now one of Reed's deputy chief operating officers. Lower assessments typically mean lower property values. Lower property values mean less paid in property taxes, which account for approximately 35 percent of Atlanta's general fund revenue. As a result of the conservative estimates, city officials say revenue was $13 million above expectations.

A city spreadsheet for May 2010 offers a further glimpse into the mayor's claim. In addition to showing higher-than-expected revenue, several city agencies spent much less than budgeted. By the end of June, the following departments were under budget:
  
In many cases, city officials say some vacant positions were not filled. Atlanta said two departments, Corrections and Public Works, were over budget by a combined $2.6 million. 
Farooqui said Reed and his staff told department heads on track to spend less than budgeted to end the fiscal year at those lower levels. The city also got help from the federal government. The Obama administration gave Atlanta nearly $5 million in stimulus funds it used for job training, Farooqui said.

Atlanta also re-examined its lease agreements and engaged in new spending practices, Farooqui said.

By this past June, the end of the city's fiscal year, Atlanta officials reported a general fund balance of $68 million. City officials said they were able to add nearly $12.3 million to the reserve through principal and other interest payments. That includes the $27 million reserve, the higher-than-expected revenue and controlled spending. Under city guidelines, one-quarter of that money must be used for large-scale projects. Subtract that and Atlanta is left with about $51 million. Once you carry the $7 million in the reserve fund from fiscal year 2009, the reserve is about $58 million.

City Councilman Howard Shook, chairman of the council's budget committee in 2008 and 2009, said he does not dispute the mayor's math. Shook said the city has tighter fiscal management, largely aided by Atlanta's new (albeit over-budget) Oracle computer system that better tracks spending. The councilman said the painful budget cuts in 2008 and the council's decision to raise property taxes in 2009 helped.

""A lot of the most painful medicine was taken before the new administration came in,"" Shook said.

Roger Lusby III, a certified public accountant, looked at some of the city's monthly budget spreadsheets at AJC PolitiFact's request. Lusby said Atlanta's numbers seem accurate, but he wanted to see more information about its reserves, how the city is handling its massive pension liability and how it manages its severance pay. Those and other factors, Lusby said, may give him a better idea of how solid the city's surplus estimate is. Lusby said he would reserve ruling that the city's claim is true until its books are audited by an independent firm, which city officials said is scheduled to be done early this year.

""I think [Reed] is doing a good job, but I hope he's working with accurate information,"" said Lusby, managing partner of the Alpharetta office of Frazier & Deeter, a certified public accounting firm.

The spreadsheets show Reed's claim seems on the money. But, as Lusby noted, the city's fiscal year 2010 books haven't been audited. Farooqui said ""there is no reason to believe the numbers will change dramatically"" after the audit. Since there's additional information that may come from the audit, we reserve the right to change the ruling if there is significant information that shows the city's numbers were on target or incorrect. For now, we'll be a little conservative here and rate Reed's statement as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFF9140>],/factchecks/2011/jan/04/kasim-reed/numbers-show-support-reeds-claim-about-atlanta-fin/

Cleveland Councilman Mike Polensek rails that sewage treatment system amounts to mistreatment of Lake Erie
","
Industrial pollution made national news and made Cleveland the butt of jokes in 1969 after the Cuyahoga River caught fire -- not for the first time -- and did $50,000 damage to bridges. The fire helped focus attention on environmental problems and contributed to passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972.

Water pollution from sanitary sewer and storm runoff has had a lower profile. But the issue has been important to Cleveland City Councilman Mike Polensek ""for more years than I care to recall,"" he says. There are almost two miles of lakefront in his ward and a good portion of that is public beach.

Polensek spoke at a meeting of the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District in November to support its $3 billion settlement with EPA that could triple sewer rates in Cleveland and about 60 suburbs, but will pay for mandated construction work to deal with combined sanitary and storm sewer overflows.

""Let's face it, this is the year 2010 and we're worse than a Third World country in terms of water quality and the way we treat our sewage,"" Polensek told sewer district trustees. ""What we're paying for now is really an indictment of the 40-year delay in living up to the Clean Water Act.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look to see if there is any truth to his comparison.

Polensek is notably outspoken, and ""Third World"" sounded like dramatic hyperbole. But the councilman told PolitiFact Ohio he was not exaggerating and would not water down his remarks.

""It's outrageous in America in 2010 that we have tributaries as polluted as the Tigris and Euphrates,"" he said. ""It's unconscionable when you see the filth that comes down that creek after a rainstorm. We have the technology to prevent it. What we haven't got is elected officials with the (guts) to make the tough decisions. They have deferred and deferred and passed the proverbial bleeping buck. You pay now or pay later.""

Two side-by-side beaches, Euclid Beach and Villa Angela, are a particular concern. Both are close to Euclid Creek, which drains a 24-square-mile section of eastern Cuyahoga County into Lake Erie. Both beaches were too unhealthy for swimming on 48 percent of the days last summer, according to the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District.

From May 2 to Sept. 6, average bacterial levels sampled daily exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's maximum E. coli standard by 40 percent. (The standard is a density of 235 parts per 100 ml of water, indicating the presence of human or animal waste that could make swimmers sick.)

""It should be a national embarrassment,"" Polensek said. ""It's a sin that we have those types of bacterial levels.""

He sees improving Great Lakes water quality as an economic development issue and a strategic defense issue, because ""We don't have to worry about trying to get water across a border.""

He is angriest about health issues.

""Where do they think our drinking water comes from?"" he asked, noting he's had complaints about respiratory, eye and ear infections blamed on contact with lake water. Women have reported vaginal infections, he said.

PolitiFact Ohio found support for Polensek's anger.

The National Resources Defense Council found Cleveland the worst urban area on the Great Lakes in bacterial samples, with the highest risk of gastrointestinal illness on Great Lakes beaches. East Side beaches get 55 percent of the nearly 5 billion gallons of raw sewage dumped into the lake in Greater Cleveland per year.

Euclid Creek is the most polluted tributary in the region.

But is it Third World?

""Third World"" once designated countries not aligned politically with the West or the East. Now it generally refers to underdeveloped and developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, but it has no single definition. ""There is no established convention for the designation of 'developed' and 'developing' countries or areas in the United Nations system,"" says the UN Statistics Division.

""An estimated 90 percent of all wastewater in developing countries is discharged untreated directly into rivers, lakes or the oceans,"" according to the United Nations Environment Programme, but we could find no benchmark characterizing recreational or bathing water of developing nations or ""Third World"" quality.

We turned for perspective to an expert not involved in local politics or government: scientist Sandra L. McLellan of the Great Lakes Water Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Her specialty is environmental toxicology, and her laboratory's major focus is investigating connections between environmental processes and human health. Her current projects involve sewage pollution in rivers and at beaches.

She did not dispute Polensek, though she preferred more careful wording. ""I think the accurate statement would be that during the time of a combined sewage overflow we're no better than a developing country,"" she said.

She found it particularly startling and significant that the regional sewer district reports more than 80 sewage overflows in a typical season on just the East Side beaches near Euclid Creek.

""It's a pretty bad situation and not up to what other cities have done,"" McLellan said. ""That's like the 1970s or '80s for most cities. They should have only two or three (overflows) a year.""

In Milwaukee, she said, construction in 1993 of a deep tunnel system reduced overflows from 50-60 per year to 2.5. That's also the specific goal of the Euclid Creek Tunnel, the first part of the sewer district's Project Clean Lake, on which construction will begin in March.

The bottom line, she said, is what happens during overflows:  ""It's a completely open sewer going directly to the rivers and streams. It is like Third World.""

So where does that leave Polensek’s statement? 

So we find Polensek’s statement has some elements of truth, but that also you need to know some important details to completely evaluate its accuracy. On the Truth-O-Meter that scores a rating of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7B30C0>],/factchecks/2011/jan/04/mike-polensek/cleveland-councilman-mike-polensek-rails-sewage-tr/

Health clinic executive says Rhode Island has the highest rate of uninsured adults in New England
","
The cost of health care is a huge issue for everyone.

If you have health insurance, the chances are excellent that you've seen your costs, along with co-payments and deductibles, go up significantly.

If you don't have health insurance, the bill you get from your doctor or hospital is strikingly higher than what people with health insurance are charged. That's because insurance companies negotiate deep discounts that uninsured people never see.

And because people who don't have insurance are seven times more likely to skip the care they need, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that typically makes your care more expensive when you do seek it. If, on top of everything else, you can't pay for that care and a hospital provides it for free, as a hospital is obligated to do, those costs are passed on to everyone else.

So it caught our attention when Marie Ghazal, chief executive officer of the Rhode Island Free Clinic, the Providence nonprofit organization that treats the uninsured, began an opinion column in The Providence Journal by asserting that ""Rhode Island has the highest percentage of uninsured adults of any state in New England.""

She stated that between 13.9 percent and 21.4 percent of residents are not insured, which translates to 139,000 to 214,000 Rhode Islanders.

We wondered if our ranking was really that poor, and why the range was so large.

When we contacted Ghazal, she said she got the information from a story in the Providence Business News. The article gives no specific numbers for Rhode Island or most other states. It was based on a map developed by the CDC that breaks the states into three categories: those having the highest proportion of people with health insurance, those having the lowest and those in between.

Rhode Island -- like New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Virginia and most of the states in the Midwest -- is in the in-between category. Ghazal said our rate of uninsured adults was 13.9 percent to 21.4 percent because, as it turns out, that's how the CDC defined the in-between group.

We asked if she had specific numbers. She said she didn't. So we went searching.

When we contacted CDC, they directed us to state-by-state numbers, as collected by Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a telephone survey that counts how many people are without health insurance at the time of the call.

According to the BRFSS statistics, which served as the basis for the map cited by Ghazal, the 2009 telephone survey of 4,318 Rhode Islands found that the percentage of uninsured adults in Rhode Island was 14.2 percent, below the national average of 16.9 percent. Thirty-two states had a lower rate of health insurance coverage than Rhode Island. The worst rate was in Texas, where 29.1 percent of the population was not covered. In 15 states, at least 20 percent of the adult population younger than 65 was without health insurance.

But we found something else while digging into the numbers. The margin of error in the survey was plus or minus 1.9 percentage points.

If you ignore the margin of error, it is true that Rhode Island had the highest rate of uninsured adults in New England. Maine, where 13.7 percent were uninsured, was closest to Rhode Island. But that's a difference of only 0.5 percentage points. Massachusetts, in contrast, had the lowest rate of uninsured -- 6.2 percent -- because the Bay State has mandatory health insurance.

However, if you consider the margin of error in the poll, we could rank ahead of New Hampshire (where 13.1 were uninsured) and Maine.

For additional context, we looked at the percentages going back to 1995 (excluding 2001 and 2002, two years when the survey results are not on the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention & Health Promotion website).

It turns out that in 2004, the level of uninsured in Rhode Island was a bit higher -- 14.4 percent; 15 years ago it was at about 13 percent. The rate did dip to 11.7 percent in the 1998 survey but, in general, the numbers have stayed consistent.

By any measure, that's still a lot of people walking around without health insurance.

Ultimately, if you ignore the margin of error, Ghazal is correct about our ranking compared with other New England states. But if you take that into account, its possible that her statement could be inaccurate.

More importantly, she's making a selective comparison. When you compare us with the rest of the country, we're better than average.

Because of those omissions, we rate her statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA73B80>],/factchecks/2011/jan/04/marie-ghazal/health-clinic-executive-says-rhode-island-has-high/

Mostly False: Austin children taught gender is fluid starting in pre-kindergarten
","A supporter of basing student access to bathrooms and locker rooms on gender identity at birth declared that as things stand, Austin's schools teach children to choose their genders. Spicewood attorney Glenna Hodge, testifying before the Texas Senate State Affairs Committee, said parents should recognize that without a protective law, their children can’t count on privacy. Hodge went on: ""We also know that schools in Austin Independent School District are teaching children as young as 4 years old that their gender is fluid–that they’re not a boy or a girl and they can choose whichever gender they want."" Asked for examples of schools doing so, Hodge told the panel in July 2017 that Austin’s Kiker and Odom elementary schools trained teachers with ""Welcoming Schools"" materials devised by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. That campaign says it focuses on achieving equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. In each training, Hodge testified, teachers were told to tell children that gender identity is fluid. We asked Hodge how she reached her conclusion about what students are taught. By phone, she said 24 of the Austin district’s 85 elementary schools undertook the training, which she described as clearing the way for students to be taught gender-fluid lessons. ""What are the teachers supposed to do with the training? What’s the point if not to affirm transgenderism?"" Hodge said. A 2017 web post Hodge pointed us to a January 2017 web post by the Southern Baptist Texan, a religious publication. The post, ""Trojan Horse: Austin ‘anti-bullying’ program pushes progressive views on gender, sexual identity,"" says the Welcoming Students material ""is taught to students as young as 4 years old"" and ""affirms same-sex marriage and parenting, gay and lesbian relationships, and transgenderism."" In one module of the teacher training, the post says, ""teachers are asked to answer questions about their preconceived ideas about gender (i.e. gender bias). The lesson states, ‘By embracing the richness of the gender spectrum, teachers and other adults can help broaden children’s understandings of gender in order to help every child feel seen and recognized.’"" The post goes on: ""By Module 5, children are told they can choose their gender identity even if that identity conflicts with biological reality. Questioning the child’s choice of gender is not an option for teachers or students,"" the post says. A teacher’s recollection Hodge also put us in touch with Caryl Ayala, who described herself by phone as a former Odom pre-kindergarten teacher where, she said, the Welcoming Schools training took place in 2015-16. She said she had no recording or notes taken during the training but pointed us to a Concerned Parents of Austin website presenting what appeared to be part of the training presentation. According to one training module, ""What is Gender?,"" presenters were to get teachers to ""recognize that gender expression is a social construct, without meaning other than the meaning we have given it."" School district responses Seeking a full grasp on what teachers were taught and what students are told, we queried the Austin district. By email, a spokeswoman, Tiffany Young, initially conveyed a statement from Peter Price, district director of social and emotional learning, stating that in the 2014-15 through 2016-17 school years, 24 elementary campuses requested and received Welcoming Schools ""professional development,"" which Price described as a ""training for teachers to provide safe, supportive, inclusive environments for students and their families and to create a conversation among adults on campus to examine our language and practices."" In each instance, Price, said, a letter was sent home at the start of the school year and parents were invited to attend a module. Young emailed us an undated letter to parents stating the training focuses on embracing family diversity, ending bullying and avoiding ""gender stereotyping and accepting diverse gender identities."" From the parent letter: ""Pressure to conform to specific gender roles can limit a child’s development by limiting experiences and expectations. We believe it is important to allow all students to reach their full potential and to feel safe expressing their individuality."" So, are students taught that gender is fluid? In a follow-up statement, Price said ""one of the biggest misconceptions about our Welcoming Schools training for teachers is that they turn around after the training and present a curriculum/lessons to students about LGTBQ topics. That does not happen. The training is for adults, so they can be better prepared to welcome all students to our schools and to ensure all students feel safe and valued. There is no curriculum or lessons for the students."" We later connected with Lisa Goodnow, the district’s executive director for academic and social emotional learning, who said by phone that children in pre-kindergarten are taught about health and safety issues, not gender identity. Human sexuality gets taken up in middle and high school, Goodnow said. Goodnow emailed us a document showing topics addressed in the district’s human sexuality curriculum from kindergarten through fifth grade. Human sexuality gets mentioned in third grade, the document says, with puberty discussed in fifth grade; there’s no direct mention of gender identity in the document. When we asked Young about Austin schools doing the Welcoming Schools training in 2017-18, she replied that no schools were doing so but the district was ""looking into creating its own training program in the future for teachers and is taking the next year to develop it."" Documentation At our inquiry, the district also gave access to hundreds of pages of emails and other documents from recent years about the Welcoming Schools trainings and gender-related topics. We didn’t spot material suggesting teachers were telling students that gender is fluid. But documents did show interest among teachers and other staff in helping students come to terms with gender identity issues. Among the documents: --A 2015 paper, ""Beyond the Gender Binary: A Group for Teens,"" suggesting middle and high schools could provide opportunities for students to explore ""the many facets of gender identity and increase feelings of well-being in trans youth."" --A 2015 email from Superintendent Paul Cruz to principals and staff sharing changes in policy adopted by the school board to protect gender identity and expression. The email said: ""Gender identity refers to a person’s innate, deeply felt psychological identification as male, female or another gender. Gender expression refers to the external manifestation of a person’s gender identity, which or may not conform to socially defined behaviors and characteristics typically associated with being either masculine or feminine."" Cruz’s email further said he hoped to see the Welcoming Schools curriculum extended to all campuses. --A 2016 email from a district official to another sharing a CNN story on what it means to be ""gender-fluid."" --A Welcoming Schools packet about using books in grades one through three to look at gender stereotyping. --A list of ""gender identity"" books for students including picture books for students starting in pre-k. ""Adventures of Tulip, Birthday Wish Fairy,"" the list says, follows Tulip ""as he deals with the birthday wishes of all the nine-year-olds in North America. Tulip receives a wish from a child known as David to live as Daniela. He doesn’t know how to help, so he seeks the wise counsel of the Wish Fairy Captain."" Another listed book: ""All I Want to Be is Me,"" is described as giving voice ""to the feelings of children who don’t fit gender stereotypes, and who just want to be free to be themselves. Includes children who are fluid in their gender identity, as well as those that feel their body doesn’t match who they really are,"" the summary says. Human Rights Campaign We also heard back from the Human Rights Campaign about its training materials. By email, spokeswoman Sarah McBride provided responses from Johanna Eager, director of Welcoming Schools, who said: ""We do not say that gender is a choice, but in workshops with educators, Welcoming Schools does reference the research and data which demonstrate that children begin to understand their gender identity as early as the age of four."" We looked over the foundation’s suggested Welcoming Schools lesson plans, noticing that none focus on children in pre-kindergarten and the lesson plan on ""understanding transgender children"" contains no language saying children should be told gender identity is fluid though there’s reference to gender as a spectrum. That particular lesson plan, intended for teachers in kindergarten through fifth grade, lists among goals the expansion of ""students’ perception and understanding of gender"" and also understanding ""what it means to be transgender using developmentally appropriate language for younger students."" The plan also calls for students to read and discuss a nonfiction story, ""I Am Jazz,"" and it says students ""will learn new vocabulary words related to gender."" From the publisher’s summary of the story: ""From the time she was two years old, Jazz knew that she had a girl's brain in a boy's body. She loved pink and dressing up as a mermaid and didn't feel like herself in boys' clothing. This confused her family, until they took her to a doctor who said that Jazz was transgender and that she was born that way. Jazz's story is based on her real-life experience and she tells it in a simple, clear way that will be appreciated by picture book readers, their parents, and teachers."" The lesson plan says teachers should understand before reading the book to students ""that gender is a spectrum, not a binary, and that we all express ourselves in many different ways along that spectrum. Each child is an individual with their own unique expression of who they are in the world,"" the plan says. Definitions offered with the lesson plan include: ""GENDER IDENTITY: How you feel — male, female, neither or both. This can be different from the anatomy that you were born with (sex assigned at birth)."" ""TRANSGENDER/TRANS: When your gender identity (how you feel) is different than how your body is (your anatomy). When a person with a boy body feels like a girl inside their heart and brain. Or, when a person with a girl body feels like a boy inside their heart and brain. "" ""GENDER BINARY: The idea that there are two distinct and opposite genders — male and female / boy and girl. This idea is limiting and doesn’t allow for the many ways that children and adults express themselves."" We followed up with Young, who noted by email that the Austin district didn’t adopt the Welcoming Schools curriculum for classroom instruction. Further, she said: ""We are not aware of any elementary school teachers who are teaching gender fluidity."" Our ruling Hodge said: ""Schools in Austin Independent School District are teaching children as young as 4 years old that their gender is fluid – that they’re not a boy or a girl and they can choose whichever gender they want."" Hodge didn’t deliver proof of Austin students including toddlers getting told that gender is fluid nor did we confirm such instruction.

Gillibrand still opposes boycott of Israel despite flip-flop
","Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand no longer supports a bill she originally co-sponsored that would punish people for boycotting Israel. ""I am going to urge the authors of the bill to change the bill, and I will not support it in its current form,"" Gillibrand said at a town hall meeting in Queens. The bill targets individuals and companies who participate in the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement, a Palestinian-led effort to remove international support for Israel by asking global leaders and businesses to cut ties with the country. Offenders could face heavy fines and even jail time under the bill. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee sent an email to its supporters about Gillibrand’s flip a few days after the event. ""New York’s junior Senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, has withdrawn her co-sponsorship of the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.720), sending a powerful message to her constituents that she no longer supports the fight to combat the international delegitimization of Israel,"" the email said. AIPAC is one of the most influential lobbying groups for pro-Israel interests in the U.S. Each major party candidate for president spoke at its conference last year. Gillibrand has taken a lot of flack since the email blast, including from Jewish leaders and online publications. A letter to the editor published in the New York Daily News claims Gillibrand now supports the BDS movement. Pro-Palestinian groups have even thanked Gillibrand for opposing the bill. Does her new stance on the bill mean she supports the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement? Gillibrand in context Gillibrand said she changed her position after meeting with the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the bill. ""We went through their reading of the bill and why they believe it says — it chills free speech, which means the bill is ambiguous,"" Gillibrand said at the town hall. The bill would fine individuals or companies anywhere from $250,000 to $1 million for engaging in any activity that supports the BDS movement, according to the ACLU. Violators could also face up to 20 years in prison. Gillibrand changed her position because, in her view, individuals should not face that kind of punishment for expressing their opinion. ""I’m against BDS but I think anybody who’s in favor should feel very comfortable speaking on any stage, anywhere in America, saying exactly why,"" Gillibrand said. ""That is what free speech is about, and I fully support it."" Gillibrand said she does support penalizing companies that participate in BDS. Gillibrand responded to her critics more than a week later in an opinion piece on Forward, a Jewish news website. ""Some have suggested that I suddenly began supporting the BDS movement when I took my name off the bill. This accusation has popped up on the Internet in recent days – both from Israel’s supporters and from Israel’s detractors. This is just plain false,"" Gillibrand wrote. ""I cannot state this more clearly: I vehemently oppose the BDS movement."" Our ruling AIPAC told its supporters Gillibrand ""no longer supports the fight to combat the international delegitimization of Israel."" AIPAC did not respond to a request to clarify its statement. Gillibrand has made it clear, both during the town hall and after, that she still opposes the BDS movement. She does not support the Israel Anti-Boycott Act in its current form because she believes it violates individual liberties. The claim misleads readers who may now believe Gillibrand supports the BDS movement.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Al Franken']","
Did Reagan and H.W. Bush issue actions similar to DACA, as Al Franken said?
","Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., took to the airwaves to defend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy the Obama administration put in place in 2012 after Congress failed to pass immigration legislation. DACA defers the deportation of certain illegal immigrants who initially entered the United States as children. President Trump has said he would rescind it and that former President Barack Obama exceeded his authority by signing it. Not so, Franken said. ""The executive order that President Obama gave on this was actually lawful,"" Franken said in a Sept. 5 interview on MSNBC. ""President Reagan did a similar thing. George H.W. Bush did a similar order."" We decided to look more closely at whether Reagan and the elder Bush took actions similar to DACA. Because Reagan and Bush are each credited with issuing multiple executive grants of immigration relief, we asked Franken’s staff to clarify which Reagan and Bush actions the senator had in mind. Franken was referring to a 1987 action Reagan took on the heels of the Immigration Reform and Control Act. That sweeping 1986 immigration overhaul granted legal status for many, but not all, illegal immigrants. Crucially, the law did not automatically apply to the spouses or children of newly-legalized immigrants, which meant families across the country were vulnerable to being split based on differences in legal status. After Congress failed to pass a bill to reduce family disruptions, Reagan drew upon his executive authority to do so on his own. His 1987 executive action to legalize the status of minor children of parents granted amnesty under the immigration overhaul affected an estimated 100,000 families. (Note that spouses and children of couples where one parent, but not both, qualified for amnesty were not included in Reagan's policy.) Reagan’s 1987 action parallels Obama’s DACA in some key ways, but differs in others. Both are examples of a president wielding his power not to apply U.S. immigration law in cases where he deems this necessary or appropriate, said David Shirk, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Using executive authority this way is not so unusual among modern presidents. As Kenneth R. Mayer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us in a previous fact-check, ""Presidents going back to at least Reagan have made unilateral adjustments to immigration law -- adding exemptions, extending protection to classes not covered by existing statutes such as children and spouses, making discretionary decisions about what constitutes ‘unlawful presence’ or what categories of people here illegally will be the focus of enforcement action."" An important distinction, however, is that while DACA provided a temporary reprieve from deportation, it fell short of giving legal status to eligible immigrants, as Reagan’s had done, Shirk said. ""(Obama’s action) allowed undocumented immigrant children to come out of the shadows, but only as long as the executive branch adhered to the policy of DACA,"" he said. ""Reagan's order gave undocumented immigrant children full legal status, with the possibility of permanent residency and eventual consideration for citizenship."" The two policies also differ in terms of the number of people affected. Whereas Reagan’s action affected an estimated 100,000 families, nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants have taken advantage of DACA. As we’ve noted previously, critics have argued that Obama’s action is different because he did it in the face of opposition from Congress (at least from the House), whereas Reagan’s policy (and Bush’s, for that matter) was undertaken to fix ""loose ends"" of the 1986 immigration law. Franken’s reference to the elder Bush concerned his 1990 executive action, which like Reagan’s before him, sought to smooth off some of the rough edges of the immigration overhaul.  To prevent families from being split up, Bush’s policy effectively forestalled the deportation of spouses and children of a person who gained legal status as a result of the 1986 law, a broader group than those affected by Reagan's action. Like DACA (and Reagan’s 1987 action), Bush’s action is another example of a president relying on executive authority to selectively apply U.S. immigration law so as not to deport certain undocumented immigrants. Similar to DACA, Bush’s action did not confer legal status. Rather, it granted deportation deferment that could be renewed periodically. Both permitted affected immigrants to receive work permits. There’s disagreement over how many undocumented immigrants were covered by Bush’s action. It was initially estimated to apply to up to 1.5 million, though Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors tighter immigration policies, has written that as few as 140,000 took advantage of it. So that’s either substantially larger or substantially smaller than the nearly 800,000 DACA recipients. Franken said, ""President Reagan did a similar thing. George H.W. Bush did a similar order"" as Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. There are differences in the substance and circumstances of DACA, on the one hand, and the Reagan and Bush actions, on the other. But they are similar in their broad strokes and even share some specific features. Most significantly, all three are examples of presidents relying on executive authority to selectively apply U.S. immigration law to lift — or lift the risk of — deportation for large numbers of undocumented immigrants. We rate this Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9EE200>],/factchecks/2017/sep/08/al-franken/did-reagan-and-hw-bush-issue-orders-similar-daca-a/

No, 30,000 scientists have not said climate change is a hoax
","Climate change doubters have no patience for claims that the overwhelming number of climate researchers believe that humans are the driving factor. Facebook users flagged a recent article on the website News Punch that asserted much more disagreement in the scientific community than is commonly thought. ""30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money,"" was the subheadline in the Sept. 2 story. That striking number of dissenting scientists has been around for many years and dates back to a 1998 petition drive conducted under the auspices of a climate change skeptic named Arthur Robinson. Robinson is a biochemist, conservative activist and four-time Republican congressional candidate in Oregon. Robinson believes human-driven climate change is a myth. Robinson’s Petition Project now counts 31,487 signatories. Before we get to who those people are, the key flaw in the News Punch statement is that the petition doesn’t say what the article claims. Here’s what people sign:  For the purposes of this fact-check, the key sentence is, ""There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth’s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth’s climate."" The petition says nothing about hoaxes or profit motives. On its face, someone signing the petition need not believe that climate change is a hoax, nor that it has been perpetrated to make money. While some or even many who signed it might hold those beliefs, the petition itself doesn’t speak to either of those conditions. In terms of the mindset of the signers, the statement relies on speculation. There are many reasons to question what it means to have over 31,000 people signing this petition. First of all, the meaning of ""scientist"" is vague. The minimum requirement is a bachelor’s of science degree. That’s no guarantee that the person studied a science related to climate change, or that the person pursued a career in science. The petition’s website says that 12,715 signers hold ""BS or equivalent academic degrees."" When we look at the number of people with some sort of background in fields that tie directly to climate change, the petition website said, ""there are 3,805 scientists trained in specialties directly related to the physical environment of the Earth."" That would be about 12 percent of the total. There are, according to the site, 9,029 people with PhDs, which comes closer to meeting a higher bar for being thought of as a scientist. Based on the site’s figures, most of them don’t specialize in climate change, but they likely are more familiar with scientific methods. These important nuances get lost. A 2012 opinion piece in Forbes described the signers as ""more than 31,000 American scientists from diverse climate-related disciplines."" That’s way off the mark, unless you count veterinarians -- one of the degrees that qualifies you as a scientist in the petition project -- and physicians. We also don’t know much about when people signed the petition. The website tells us that thousands of signatures came in 1998 and 1999 when the petition was first circulated. It also says, ""The majority of the current listed signatories signed or re-signed the petition after October 2007."" The problem is, the scientific consensus on mankind’s role in climate change has grown over time. Even if more than half of the signers came after that date, it doesn’t mean that those who came before remain skeptical of climate change. There’s reason to think that opinions can shift. When the magazine Scientific American reached out to a random sample of 30 names on the list in 2006, it found ""six said they would not sign the petition today, three did not remember any such petition, one had died, and five did not answer."" We reached out to the publishers of News Punch and did not hear back. An article on the News Punch website said that ""30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money."" The source is a well-known petition project. The key flaw is that the petition challenges the science, but it doesn’t cast human-driven climate change as a hoax aimed at making some people rich. That is pure interpretation by the website. The use of the word ""scientists"" is misleading, since a signatory need not be a scientist today and need not have done more than earned a bachelor of science degree in any field. The actual number of climate-related specialists is about 12 percent of the total. And these are not currently confirmed signatories as the list has been circulating since 1998. For all these reasons, we rate this claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE56300>],/factchecks/2017/sep/08/blog-posting/no-30000-scientists-have-not-said-climate-change-h/

No, ISIS didn't lay down its arms after Katy Perry encouraged world peace
","Just about everyone wants to see world peace. But the idea that the bad guys are just going to lay down their weapons has long been a powerful source of ridicule. In a post dated May 24, 2017, but which seemed to gain steam on social media in early September, the website Babylon Bee said that the terrorist group variously known as ISIS or the Islamic State had given up its fight just because American singer Katy Perry had called for co-existence in an interview. In an article headlined, ""ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry’s Impassioned Plea To ‘Like, Just Co-Exist,’"" the website wrote, ""Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, released a statement Wednesday confirming that ISIS would be immediately surrendering its fight to establish a powerful caliphate after viewing an interview in which pop singer Katy Perry said, ‘The greatest thing we can do is just unite and love on each other and like, no barriers, no borders, like, we all need to just co-exist.’ "" The article raised red flags at Facebook, and we’re fact-checking it here as part of Facebook’s efforts to fight fake news. It’s not so obvious on the page showing the ISIS-Katy Perry article, but the Babylon Bee is a satire site. At the bottom of its home page, there’s a line that reads: ""The Babylon Bee is Your Trusted Source For Christian News Satire."" A glance through other headlines on the site does confirm that the site runs fairly obvious satirical articles that often have religious themes. For instance, the site ran one article about Texas-based megachurch pastor Joel Osteen headlined, ""Lakewood Church Issues Eclipse Glasses For Gazing At Joel Osteen’s Teeth."" Another article was headlined, ""Heaven Department Of Tourism Advises 2018 Round-Trip Tickets Selling Out Fast"" So the Babylon Bee is more openly satirical than some other examples we’ve been forwarded by Facebook, but we’ll still confirm for the record that ISIS did not, after all, stop fighting for an Islamic caliphate just because Katy Perry suggested it. The genesis of the joke, as Snopes.com has noted, comes from comments Perry made on the Elvis Duran Morning Show on May 23, 2017, one day after a suicide bombing inspired by ISIS killed 22 people at the Manchester Arena in England during a concert by pop star Ariana Grande. In the interview, Perry said: ""I think the greatest thing that we can do now is just unite as people, as fan bases, all of it, you know? Whatever we say behind people’s backs – because the Internet can be a little bit ruthless as far as fan bases go – but I think that the greatest thing we can do is just unite and love on each other. And no barriers, no borders – we all need to just co-exist."" (Footnote: Perry later performed with Grande at a benefit concert for the Manchester victims.) Some conservative commentators on social media mocked Perry’s remarks as geopolitically naive, though they often did so without noting that Perry had been seeking to promote unity and respect between the fans of different singers, not trying to ideologically reconcile extreme Islamism with advanced democracy. For instance, a Fox & Friends tweet touted commentator Michelle Malkin’s remark that Perry's call for ""no barriers, no borders"" typifies the ""liberal mindset of celebs who don't operate in reality."" .@michellemalkin: Katy Perry's call for ""no barriers, no borders"" after attack is liberal mindset of celebs who don't operate in reality pic.twitter.com/FusCx3YVZ2 Perry responded to Malkin through a pair of tweets.

Wisconsin GOP mostly misfires in attack on governor candidate Tony Evers over school porn case
","The day after word surfaced that state schools superintendent Tony Evers would announce a campaign for governor, the Wisconsin Republican Party attacked. Unveiling a digital ad campaign on Aug. 21, 2017, the GOP claimed Evers ""allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students."" The Madison-area teacher was fired for viewing images of nudity on his school computer and showing at least one of them to a female co-worker. But he got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he had been improperly fired. And that decision was upheld by two courts. The Republicans contend, in effect, that even though the legal system returned the teacher to his job, Evers had the power to stop him from teaching at all -- anywhere in the state -- by revoking his teaching license. They made essentially the same attack in a radio ad released Sept. 6, 2017. As we’ll see, this fact check turns largely on what state law said at the time about revoking a teacher’s license for ""immoral behavior"" -- a law that was changed, in part, because of this case. The governor’s race Republican Gov. Scott Walker has all but announced he will seek a third term in 2018. Evers, a Democrat, has won three statewide elections for state superintendent, a nonpartisan office, since 2009. The other leading Democrats with gubernatorial campaigns up and running are Andy Gronik, a businessman who lives in the Milwaukee suburb of Fox Point, and state Rep. Dana Wachs of Eau Claire. The case of Andy Harris The Republican attack centers on Andy Harris, who started teaching in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison, in 1993. He had no disciplinary history before his December 2010 firing. At the time, Harris taught seventh-grade science at one of the district’s two middle schools; now he has the same job at the other middle school. Here are the major events in the case, based on news reports, the arbitrator’s decision and a state appeals court decision: Dec. 2009 School district announces Harris had been placed on leave because he received from his sister 23 emails containing pornography and other adult content. Many were jokes that showed images of nude or partially nude women, one of which Harris shared with a co-worker who complained to the principal. None were seen by students. An investigation by the school district finds that more than 30 teachers and administrators had accessed inappropriate jokes or sexually explicit materials on their school computers. Seven educators in addition to Harris were disciplined: five teachers received unpaid suspensions, one substitute teacher was dismissed and an administrator resigned. May 2010 School board fires Harris. The district notifies the state Department of Public Instruction, per a state law requiring school districts to report dismissals that are based on immoral conduct. Feb. 2012 Acting on a grievance filed by the teachers union, arbitrator Karen Mawhinney, a Burlington attorney, overturns Harris’ firing and reduces his penalty to 15 days of unpaid suspension. Harris’ behavior did not meet the state law’s definition of immoral conduct because ""there was no endangerment of the health, safety, welfare or education of any pupil,"" she wrote. She also said ""his worst offense is forwarding one inappropriate e-mail to two friends and not exercising the good judgment to discourage his sister from sending these types of e-mails to him."" She added: ""The fact that he was discharged while others were suspended or received written reprimands or nothing at all, the discharge cannot stand."" Aug. 2013 State Court of Appeals upholds a decision made by a circuit court, which had upheld the arbitrator’s decision. Jan. 2014 After state Supreme Court announces it will not review the appeals court decision, Harris returns to the classroom. The next day, Walker asks Evers to begin the process of revoking Harris’ teaching license. Apr. 2014 The Department of Public Instruction announces it will not revoke Harris’ license, saying his conduct ""was highly inappropriate"" but did not meet the legal definition of ""immoral conduct"" in state law because it ""did not involve children in any manner."" ‘Found guilty’ The GOP says Harris was ""found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school,"" suggesting there was a criminal conviction. Harris did share images of nudity, and at least one instance forwarded an email containing such images, he received on his school computer. But he was never accused of, or charged with, committing any crime. ‘Immoral conduct’ When Harris was fired in December 2010, state law defined immoral conduct, according to the Legislature’s nonpartisan legal advisers, ""as conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil."" And is the pivotal word there. (Indeed, the Wisconsin Association of School Boards would make that point in successfully advocating that the law be changed.) Evers’ department did have the discretion on whether to go through license revocation proceedings, which Harris could have challenged. But the department decided against it after concluding, separately from the arbitrator’s decision, that his behavior didn’t endanger kids as defined by the law at that time, spokesman Tom McCarthy told us. In other words, he said, in the department’s view there was no legal basis to take away Harris’ license. That position appears to be supported by the fact that in November 2011, nearly a year after Harris’ firing, Walker signed a measure that redefined immoral conduct to include ""the intentional use of an educational agency’s equipment to download, view, solicit, seek, display, or distribute pornographic material."" That is, the new law, which Evers supported and which was prompted partly by the Harris case, specifies that what Harris did is legal cause for license revocation -- and that there doesn’t have to be any endangerment of kids. The old law didn’t. Finally, the GOP argues that there was one important fact Evers had that the arbitrator didn’t: After there was outcry from parents about Harris’ return, the school district allowed students to attend a study hall if they didn’t feel comfortable in Harris’ class. The GOP says that endangered students’ education, since they were missing valuable instruction time. In response, McCarthy told us that the law allows the state to revoke a teacher’s license only based on the teacher’s conduct -- not based on parents’ objections to a teacher or a district’s decision to provide an accommodation like the study hall. Our rating The state Republican Party says Evers ""allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students."" The teacher was not found guilty of, or even charged with, any crime. Rather, he was fired for viewing pornographic material on his school computer. He got his job back, however, after an arbitrator ruled that the firing was not justified, in part because the arbitrator concluded that the behavior did not endanger any students. Evers, as the state schools superintendent, had the discretion to initiate license revocation proceedings. But state law at the time required the endangerment of kids in order to revoke a teacher’s license and, like the arbitrator, Evers concluded that the teacher’s conduct didn’t endanger kids.

Putnam wrongly says it's unlawful for students to talk about tests with parents
","Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam is railing against big government in his campaign for governor, repeating one story from his young son to demonstrate ridiculous overreach. The story goes like this: Putnam’s son had to write an essay as part of a statewide exam about whether or not to keep the penny after reading an article about it. Putnam doesn’t think anything of it and brings up the story to a principal of another school in a different town. The principal gives him a horrified look, because Putnam’s son is not supposed to share the details of the state test. According to Putnam, the principal said, "" 'He could get in big trouble’ and here’s the kicker quote ‘that’s against the law.’ "" From a breakfast in Kissimmee to a party meeting in Orlando, Putnam has repeated a version of this story to drum up support with voters fed up with government getting between parents and kids. ""We're still doing dumb things like telling the parent of an 11-year-old that it's against the law for them to tell their parents what they were tested on something that will determine whether they're promoted or not,"" Putnam said during a speech at the Republican Party of Florida quarterly meeting Aug. 12. ""That will end when I'm governor. That's crazy talk.""   This staple of his stump speeches made us wonder. Can students really not disclose the contents of the standardized tests to their parents? Is it really against the law? Putnam’s story speaks to a larger issue of children being afraid to talk to their parents about tests because of ambiguous testing rules. However, doing so is not against the law, and the state has made efforts to clarify those conversations. In 2014, the Florida Department of Education phased out the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test and replaced it with the Florida Standards Assessment. The testing system measures students’ achievement in math, language arts, science, biology, U.S. history and civics depending in certain grade levels.   These tests have a lot of rules and procedures laid out in the FSA testing manual for administrators, which is the basis for Putnam’s claim. The statements in play come from a section labeled ""Discussing Test Content after Testing,"" which is read aloud to students before the exams. The first part tells students they cannot share test specifics, with an emphasis on modern communication methods. ""Because the content in all statewide assessments is secure, you may not discuss or reveal details about the test items or passages after the test. This includes any type of electronic communication, such as texting, emailing, or posting online, for example, on websites like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram."" However, the section goes on to address student-parent conversations — something Putnam’s story omits. It says: ""While students may not share information about secure test content after testing, this policy is not intended to prevent students from discussing their testing experiences with their parents/families."" A list of frequently asked questions for parents on the FSA website also addresses the security of testing content, using similar language. One answer explains that students are asked to sign an acknowledgement that says they cannot reveal details about the test ""to anyone."" That, again, is followed by more guidance in bold emphasis that says the policy ""is not intended to prevent students from discussing their testing experiences with parents and families."" Here’s how it looks on the website:  Putnam's campaign (and undoubtedly some test administrators and students) interpret these instructions to mean that students cannot share test content specifics with anyone, including their parents, but can generally discuss how the exam ""experience"" went.   We wanted to know how the state defined ""testing experiences."" It doesn’t. ""The department does not monitor or interfere with personal family interactions, and parents have the discretion to determine the depth and breadth of their family’s discussions,"" said DOE spokeswoman Meghan Collins. The portion about parent involvement was added fairly recently following concern from parents that students could not talk about their tests after signing the acknowledgement. In fall 2015, the department added this language to testing manuals and to parent/guardian letter templates it provides to districts. For the record, the relevant Florida statutes about punishable testing offenses (1008.24) do not say anything about students talking to their parents about the exams. In practice, school officials are most concerned with students sharing testing details with other students. Local officials we interviewed did not have any examples of students punished for discussing tests with their parents, and they said they do not discourage those conversations. ""We have not experienced any issue with students speaking with their parents about the FSA, nor have (we) received complaints about the policy,"" said Pinellas County School District spokeswoman Lisa Wolf. In Hillsborough County, school spokesman Grayson Kamm said the administrative guidance ""is not statute"" and clearly addresses student-to-student discussion. ""Students are expected not to share the exact items and answers with other students as to guard against sharing content, which could invalidate results,"" Kamm said. Jane Windsor, an education law attorney at Sarasota-based Windsor Law LLC, said she was not aware of any law or statute prohibiting students from talking to their parents about testing material. ""Any parent is going to want to know how a big test went. That’s a normal conversation and even if the child is talking about specific questions, that’s not a danger,"" Windsor said. ""What is a danger is sharing contents of a test with another student. That’s definitely an ethical issue."" Some parents remain concerned, even after the state’s attempts to protect parent discussions. Melissa Bywalski is the parent of a fifth-grader at Kathleen Elementary School in Lakeland and a member of the Opt Out Florida Network, a group against state-mandated standardized testing. She said her son Zack refused to talk to her about a state test he took in third grade. ""He was worried he was going to get in the trouble for telling me where he took the test, how long it took and even how he felt he did on the test,"" she said. Bywalski said she worries that the test rules create an atmosphere in the classroom where students feel like they can’t open up about problems at school. ""What if he feels he can’t talk to me about a bully, or something?"" she asked. Putnam said, ""We're still doing dumb things like telling the parent of an 11-year-old that it's against the law for them to tell their parents what they were tested on something that will determine whether they're promoted or not."" He said he would change this if elected governor. There are rules that prohibit students from disclosing test information with other students, particularly through texts and social media. One FAQ response goes further to say students cannot share the information with ""anyone."" However, the state has updated its rules to explicitly say that conversations about ""testing experiences"" between parents and children are not a violation of the rules — and they are not against the law. Putnam does voters a disservice by repeating the notion that these conversations are discouraged and could spell legal jeopardy. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC014280>],/factchecks/2017/sep/07/adam-putnam/putnam-wrongly-says-its-against-law-students-talk-/

Has legal immigration hit a record high, as Rick Santorum said?
","In a discussion over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA,  prior to President Donald Trump’s announcement to repeal it, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said immigration laws should be vigorously enforced. That’s because legal immigration has hit a record high. ""We have record levels of legal immigration… We have over a million people a year, more than at any time in the history of this country,"" Santorum said on CNN’s State of the Union on Sept. 3, 2017. ""We have the largest percentage of immigrants, almost tied now with the historical high as a percentage of immigrants living in this country."" Are more immigrants coming into the United States legally than at any other time in history, and are they on track to outnumber previous immigrant populations? The number of annual legal immigrants has been higher in the past. But Santorum has a point that the United States is on pace to surpass general immigration proportions (although it’s not there yet). A total of 1,051,031 persons were granted lawful immigration status in 2015, the latest year recorded by the Homeland Security Department. Over half of those were already living in the United States. That encompasses those who received a green card, were admitted as temporary nonimmigrants, were granted asylum or refugee status, or are naturalized. That is over a million, as Santorum said, but it’s not the highest it’s ever been. There were 1,090,172 legal immigrants granted status in 1989; 1,535,872 in 1990; and 1,826,595 in 1991. Between 2001 and 2014, there were 11 years in which lawful immigrants also surpassed 1 million, eight of which surpassed the 2015 rate. And it’s not a recent phenomenon. Between 1905 and 1914, there were six years in which legal immigration surpassed 1 million. Four of those had higher immigration rates than 2015. And that’s significant because it was a much larger percentage of the population compared to today.  Immigration law largely explains the trends above. The lack of numerical restrictions on entry before 1924 (except for Chinese immigrants) meant that nearly every immigrant was legal, making the early numbers more representative than the current ones (as illegal immigration is unaccounted for in the chart). It also meant fewer deportations than today. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 legalized 2.7 million unauthorized immigrants, reflected in the spike between 1989 and 1991. And more recent spikes are explained by the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act, the Real ID Act, and backlog reductions at United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. If Santorum had been talking about both illegal and legal immigrants combined, the number of annual immigrants would be slightly higher today, but still not a record. The Census Bureau found that nearly 1.5 million legal and illegal immigrants had arrived in the United States in 2014, but 1.66 million arrived in 2000. The total 2015 number isn’t yet available, but it was projected to reach 1.6 million. On the overall number of immigrants, Santorum is correct. The Census Bureau estimates there are 43.3 million foreign-born people in the United States, which beats all previous records. Pew Research Center places that number at 45 million. But the overall population of the United States has more than tripled from 1900 to 2000, which means we should also look at percentages of the population. The immigrant share of the U.S. population was 13.5 percent in 2015. That still doesn’t surpass the record high immigrant shares in 1910, 1890 and 1870, which were 14.7 percent, 14.8 percent and 14.4 percent respectively. Data collection began in 1850. The percentage of the overall population that was foreign born was only a little higher back then (while the absolute number of immigrants was high) because proportionally, more people went back home and immigrants, like citizens, suffered a higher death rate than today. As Santorum said, we are on track to beat the record. The Center for Immigration Studies projects the United States will surpass the 14.8 percent marker in 2023, driven largely by legal immigration. Pew projects the fast-growing immigrant population will push the share of the foreign-born U.S. population to a record of 18 percent in 2065. When asked if recent changes in immigration policy could alter those projections, Center for Immigration Studies director Steven Camarota said they likely wouldn’t, as the immigrant percentage of the population has never grown as exponentially as it has since 1970 (from 4.7 to 13.5 percent). Columbia University immigration historian Mae Ngai said we should be wary of population trend predictions to begin with, as they are based on assumptions that don’t always hold true. Santorum said, ""We have over a million (legal immigrants) a year, more than at any time in the history of this country. We have the largest percentage of immigrants, almost tied now with the historical high as a percentage of immigrants living in this country."" While we do have over 1 million annual legal immigrants, it’s been surpassed multiple times in both recent years and at the turn of the twentieth century. We are still a few years away from exceeding the record from last century of the share of immigrant population, and that’s based on projections. We rate this statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFADA80>],/factchecks/2017/sep/06/rick-santorum/has-legal-immigration-hit-record-high-rick-santoru/

Sid Miller: Poll shows 70 percent to 75 percent of Americans oppose removals of Confederate statues
","Sid Miller objected to the recent in-the-night removals of four statues of people with Confederate ties from pedestals at the University of Texas. The big-hatted Republican serving as Texas agriculture commissioner further said most Americans agree that such statues should be left in place. In an August 2017 interview with Karina Kling of Spectrum Cable’s Capital Tonight, Miller disputed the notion that statues venerating Confederate figures touch off controversy. ""I don’t believe they do cause controversy,"" Miller said. ""I saw a poll, I think (on) NPR, 70 or 75 percent of the people would like to see those statues remain up and not taken down."" We decided to check Miller’s poll claim. A caution: Any comparison of poll results is limited by the amount of information available about how and when each poll was taken, what’s asked (there are invariably variations) and the demographic and partisan mix of each poll’s respondents. So, we recognized that fact-checking Miller’s reference to precise results might prove knotty. Huffington Post round-up A Huffington Post news story published the day Miller was interviewed rolled out the results of a HuffPost/YouGov poll of 1,000 adult U.S. citizens who were surveyed over the web Aug. 15-16, 2017--specifically, 353 Democrats, 397 independents and 246 Republicans, the organization reported. Its poll question:""Do you favor or oppose removing statues and memorials of Confederate leaders?"" Thirty-three percent favored removals, 48 percent were opposed, 18 percent were unsure. The poll also had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percent so you could speculate that 52 percent of the respondents wanted such statues to stay put. That’s considerably shy of 70-plus percent. But the story noted six other polls taken Aug. 15, 2017, to Aug. 22, 2017, each one asking about Confederate statues three days or more after confrontations between white supremacists and protesters in Charlottesville, Va., crumbled after a driver drove into pedestrians, killing one. Here’s the Huffington Post’s summary of recent statue polls:                            SOURCE: Graphic, ""Polls Find Little Support For Confederate Statue Removal — But How You Ask Matters,"" the Huffington Post, Aug. 23, 2017 (accessed Aug. 25, 2017) The Marist Poll We noticed the post-Charlottesville poll showing the largest share of respondents opposed to removing statues was the Marist Poll taken Aug. 14-15, 2017, by mobile and landline phones of 1,125 U.S adults. After the poll interviews, the pollster said, the regionally balanced samples were combined and balanced to reflect the 2013 U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey one-year estimates for age, gender, income, race, and region. Marist said that of the 859 registered voters included in the poll, 37 percent were independents, 36 percent were Democrats and 26 percent were Republicans. The poll, taken in collaboration with NPR and the PBS NewsHour, asked: ""Do you think statues honoring leaders of the Confederacy should remain as a historical symbol/be removed because they are offensive to some people?"" Sixty-two percent of the surveyed adults said the statues should remain, 27 percent said they should be removed, 11 percent were unsure. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 2.9 percentage points meaning you could say close to 65 percent, or as few as 59 percent, of the polled preferred leaving such statues in place. Miller notes a deeper break-out By phone to our inquiry, a Miller campaign spokesman, Todd Smith, said Miller reached his 70 percent or 75 percent figure as an estimate of where Texans stand based on the Marist poll’s detailed results showing 67 percent of moderates and 81 percent of conservative or very conservative respondents said such statues should remain. ""He was trying to extrapolate Texas numbers out of that,"" Smith said. ""I don’t think Commissioner Miller was trying to give an exact number."" The results also were broken down regionally. Sixty-six percent of respondents in the South favored statues to remain, 23 percent backed removals. Other polls identified by Ariel Edwards-Levy, the Huffington Post’s polling director, suggested 49 percent to 54 percent of respondents oppose statue removals (though it’s again worth stressing it matters how each question was posed and who was polled and how results were weighted). An outlier Only a poll by North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling, which showcases Democratic clients, delivered contrary results, perhaps because of how its question was framed and worded. The company’s general summary of its poll taken Aug. 18-21, 2017, says: ""Voters have nuanced views when it comes to Confederate monuments. Overall 39% say they support monuments honoring the Confederacy to 34% who say they oppose them. That's basically unchanged from the 42/35 spread we found on this question when we polled it in June."" Even though voters narrowly support the monuments, the summary says, 58 percent of respondents said ""they support relocating them from government property and moving them to museums or other historic sites where they can be viewed in proper historical context. There's bipartisan support for that approach with Democrats (72/14), independents (52/27), and Republicans (46/42) all in favor of it."" Public Policy Polling says it surveyed 887 registered voters. Eighty percent of participants, selected through a list based sample, responded by phone with the remaining 20 percent participating on the web. Forty-one percent of respondents self-identified as Democrats, 31 percent as Republicans, 29 percent as independents. After a question about supporting or opposing monuments honoring the Confederacy, the poll asked: ""Do you support or oppose relocating monuments honoring the Confederacy from government property and moving them to museums or other historic sites where they can be viewed in proper historical context?"" Fifty-eight percent supported relocation, 26 percent were opposed, 16 percent were unsure. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.3 percent so you could speculate that as much as 61 percent of respondents supported relocation. Our ruling Miller said a poll showed 70 percent to 75 percent of people oppose the removal of Confederate statues. All but one of the latest national polls, we confirmed, show more Americans in opposition to tumbling such statues than in favor. But most polls show a little more than 50 percent to 54 percent of respondents opposed with only the Marist poll, which Miller mentioned, indicating more than 60 percent in opposition. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Jeff Denham’s Half True claim top Democrats voted for border wall
","On the day the Trump administration announced it will end the so-called Dreamer program in six months, California Congressman Jeff Denham floated the idea for a bill that could further secure the border and protect undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. ""This is certainly an opportunity to combine a Dreamer Act with border security,"" Denham, a Republican who represents the Modesto area, told NPR on Sept. 5, 2017. ""This is something that should have bipartisan support. The president’s already asking for border security, why wouldn’t we add a Dreamer aspect to that as well?"" The administration’s action affects about 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Roughly a quarter of these ‘Dreamers’ live in California. The Obama-era program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, has allowed them to continue to live and work in the U.S. temporarily, following a vetting process. President Trump gave Congress six months to find a legislative solution to DACA before the administration formally ends it. In his interview with Rachael Martin of NPR, Denham went on to claim that a DACA/border bill shouldn’t be controversial because top Democrats have supported border security, and specifically a border wall, in years past. MARTIN: ""When you say border security, you’re talking about the wall? What do you mean by that?"" DENHAM: ""Yes, yes. Which was bipartisan back when (then) Sen. Obama, Sen. Schumer and (then) Sen. Clinton all voted for it. This used to be a very bipartisan thing before President Trump announced it. I think it can be bipartisan once again."" Denham is citing votes by the Democrats in 2006 on an act that authorized a fence. It’s a claim that takes things out of context and was repeated multiple times by Donald Trump during his campaign for president and was made in April by White House budget director Mick Mulvaney. After he spoke with NPR, Denham repeated the idea of a combined border security and DACA bill in an interview on Capital Public Radio. In that interview, he called border security a bipartisan idea but did not directly call Trump’s wall bipartisan or reveal whether he favors that specific proposal. As PolitiFact has noted several times in the past, the fence voted on in 2006 was less ambitious than the ‘big, beautiful wall’ Trump has pitched over the past two years and promised Mexico would pay for. Here’s PolitiFact’s analysis of this topic: The Secure Fence Act of 2006 The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President George W. Bush, authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the United States and Mexico. The act also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to curb illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. At the time the act was being considered, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer were all members of the Senate. (Schumer of New York is now the Senate minority leader.) Obama, Clinton, Schumer and 23 other Democratic senators voted in favor of the act when it passed in the Senate by a vote of 80 to 19. Originally, the act called on the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended later, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement. Currently, 702 miles of fencing separates the United States from Mexico, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.  In this Sept. 15, 2015, file photo, a farmer passes along a borer fence that divides his property, Tuesday, in Mission, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) So how does that compare to Trump’s wall? Trump plans for the wall are vague, but here’s what we know. He said the wall doesn’t need to run the nearly 2,000 miles of the border, but about 1,000 miles because of natural barriers. He said it could cost between $8 billion and $12 billion, be made of precast concrete, and rise 35 to 40 feet, or 50 feet, or higher. Cost estimates by others, including this one cited by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., vary widely. Experts have repeatedly told PolitiFact that the differences in semantics between a wall and a fence are not too significant because both block people. Still, there are obvious differences between the fence and Trump’s wall proposal. A 2016 Associated Press report from the border described ""rust-colored thick bars"" that form ""teeth-like slats"" 18 feet high. ""There are miles of gaps between segments and openings in the fence itself,"" the report said. Trump criticized the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 campaign. ""Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad,"" Trump said. (Actually, the project didn’t face environmental hurdles; we rated that part of the claim Mostly False.) It’s also worth noting that the political context surrounding the 2006 vote was different, too. Democrats normally in favor of looser immigration laws saw the Secure Fence Act of 2006 as the lesser of two evils, according to a Boston Globe report that detailed the legislative process. Ever since Trump proposed his wall during the presidential campaign, Democrats have called it overkill and too expensive. Meanwhile, PolitiFact California asked Denham’s spokeswoman for evidence to support the claim. She pointed to the votes by Obama, Clinton and Schumer in 2006. This isn’t the first time Denham has made a puzzling claim about ‘bipartisan’ efforts in Congress. In May, he told town hall attendees that the process that led to the GOP health care bill, passed exclusively by House Republicans, was ""bipartisan."" We found it was a poor choice of words given how little cooperation there was over the bill. Experts told us it applied only in the most bare bones sense that both Republicans and Democrats had a chance to read and scrutinize the bill in committees. Our ruling Denham recently claimed that Obama, Schumer and Clinton voted for a border wall in 2006. They did vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. Still, the fence they voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump is proposing. Trump himself called the 2006 fence a ""nothing wall."" PolitiFact has rated several similar claims Half True, noting they are partially accurate but ignore important context. Denham’s claim also gets it about half right, but leaves out key information. We rate it Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Hurricane Irma can't be a Category 6 storm
","A hurricane with winds in excess of 180 miles per hour is scary enough. But some corners of the Internet are stirring additional panic -- and attracting additional clicks -- by referring to an extreme hurricane category that doesn’t even exist. The web post appeared as Hurricane Irma was powering through the Caribbean, days ahead of an expected landfall somewhere in Florida. The storm was one of the most powerful to form in the Atlantic Ocean in decades, with sustained winds as high as 185 miles per hour. Into this maelstrom came a website posing as an arm of CNN (spoiler, it’s not) posting a page headlined, ""HURRICANE IRMA could be a Category 6 by the time it hits East Coast."" The advertising-filled page has almost no content of its own -- just an audio recording of a folksy, older-sounding woman rambling, stream-of-consciousness style, about the approach of Irma. At one point, she says, ""The wind speeds are way up there into the category 6 territory."" A flurry of other questionable websites also played with the idea of Irma becoming a Category 6 storm. There is no such thing. The scale used by the National Hurricane Center only goes as high as 5. The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale was developed by Herbert Saffir, an engineer in Coral Gables, Fla., and Robert Simpson, who headed the National Hurricane Center from 1967 to 1973. The scale used wind speeds as a guide to predict the extent of structural damage. ""Saffir, an engineer and expert on wind damage who helped write the Dade County, Fla., building code, developed the first version of the scale in 1971 for a United Nations report on construction that could stand up to high winds,"" wrote Jack Williams the founding weather editor of USA Today and co-author of Hurricane Watch: Forecasting the Deadliest Storms on Earth. As for Simpson, Williams wrote, one of his formative experiences at the National Hurricane Center came with the approach of Hurricane Camille to the Mississippi coast on Aug. 16, 1969. The storm was shaping up to be extremely dangerous, but Simpson grappled with the best way to communicate this to residents in the storm’s path. ""Simpson broke the Weather Bureau's rule against using specific wind speed or surge figures in forecasts -- they were supposed to say things such as ‘strong winds and dangerously high water are expected,’ "" Williams wrote. ""After it was all over, despite the success of the evacuations, Simpson felt he needed a better way to communicate what a storm is capable of doing. He correlated Saffir's wind damage rankings with the surge potential to create the scale used today."" While officials at the National Hurricane Center began using Simpson’s new scale internally, it only began releasing it to the public in 1975, amid clamor by the media for an easily understandable metric. Officially, the Saffir-Simpson scale is based on a hurricane's sustained wind speed. ""Hurricanes reaching Category 3 and higher are considered major hurricanes because of their potential for significant loss of life and damage,"" according to the National Hurricane Center. ""Category 1 and 2 storms are still dangerous, however, and require preventative measures."" The now-familiar scale of 1 to 5 breaks down as follows: Category Sustained winds (mph) Types of damage 1 74-95 Very dangerous winds will produce some damage 2 96-110 Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage 3 111-129 Devastating damage will occur 4 130-156 Catastrophic damage will occur 5 157+ Catastrophic damage will occur The scale has changed in one significant way over the years. In 2010, the federal agency removed references to storm surge from the scale after some surge expectations proved to be off-base. (Storm surge refers to how far open waters reach beyond their normal levels on coastal land.) Instead, the center directs people to more specific forecasts about storm surge. Unlike the Fujita scale for tornadoes, which runs from 0 to 5, the Saffir-Simpson scale uses measurements taken before a storm hits land. The Fujita ratings are assigned after a storm has hit and the damage is investigated. From time to time, there has been discussion of whether a new category -- Category 6 -- should be added to the scale. That decision would likely fall to the National Hurricane Center after discussions with scientists in the field, said Jill Trepanier, a hurricane specialist in the Louisiana State University department of geography and anthropology. A simple extrapolation from the existing categories would probably set the threshold for a new Category 6 around 180 mph, making Irma a good candidate for that category if it existed, said James B. Elsner, the chair of geography at Florida State University who also runs a business called Climatek that develops software for hurricane and tornado risk models. The idea of creating a Category 6 is often met with skepticism, however. The most frequently cited reason is that Category 6 would add nothing to the understanding of how destructive the storm would be for buildings and other structures. ""Almost no structures can withstand sustained winds over 155 mph,"" said Michael M. Bell, an associate professor in atmospheric science at Colorado State University. ""At those wind speeds, significant damage or even total destruction of most buildings is expected. By this definition, adding a Category 6 would not add any new information, since the strongest criteria for expected wind damage has already been met."" Bill Read, the former director of the National Hurricane Center, agreed in an email with PolitiFact. And the scale’s co-creator, Simpson, agreed as well, in a 1991 interview. Asked whether the scale should be modified to include categories above 5, he said that above 155 mph, ""it's going to cause rupturing damages (to buildings) that are serious no matter how well it's engineered. … That's the reason why we didn't try to go any higher than that anyway."" In fact, several scientists said that a more useful change, if one had to be made, would be to focus less on wind speed specifically, either by modifying the Saffir-Simpson scale to include other factors or by giving added attention to other measurements. ""I personally believe that we need to work on effectively communicating the other hazards that tropical cyclones bring, including heavy rainfall and storm surge,"" Bell said. Hurricane Harvey, which hit coastal Texas, ""did cause significant wind damage as a Category 4, but much of the devastation in Houston and the surrounding areas was caused by inland flooding from sustained rainfall while Harvey was a tropical storm."" Similarly, ""much of the damage from Hurricane Katrina was caused by storm surge when the winds were Category 3,"" Bell said. ""These multiple hazards may not be well-correlated with the Saffir-Simpson Category at landfall, and therefore it is an incomplete description of the storm's destructive potential."" Trepanier said there’s no reason why a Category 6 is needed to communicate how fearsome Irma is. ""Irma is a beast,"" she said. ""It is safe to say the wind speeds are rare, but I see no benefit in calling it a Category 6. It should be considered catastrophic. And that is how people should refer to it."" So, as of now, there is no such thing as a Category 6 storm. The web post suggesting that Irma is one rates Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8E9100>],/factchecks/2017/sep/06/blog-posting/no-hurricane-irma-cant-be-category-6-storm/

No, Lady Gaga was not arrested for criticizing Melania Trump. That’s fake news
","A fake news items claiming that pop star Lady Gaga was arrested after criticizing Melania Trump is a hoax that’s been circulating since before the 2016 election. The story claims that Lady Gaga’s Nov. 6, 2016, tweet criticizing Trump set in motion a dramatic chain of events that unfolded days before the country would cast their ballots in the general election. ""[email protected] to say u will stand for ""anti-bullying"" is hypocrisy. Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed,"" Lady Gaga tweeted. According to the fake account, just hours after the offending tweet, Gaga and Melania Trump met face-to-face, with Gaga hurling insults while the future first lady ignored the enraged pop star. That’s when Gaga threw something at Trump, according to fake witnesses, forcing the Secret Service to intervene. ""The New York Post tried to reach out to the NYPD after it was reported that GooGoo was taken away in a black Yukon in handcuffs, but as of yet there’s no record of an arrest,"" the item read. ""You can rest assured if this incident isn’t prosecuted by the corrupt liberals in the city government that the less-than-lady will be staring down the barrel of a multi-million dollar lawsuit."" The item surfaced Sep. 3 on American Flavor, which we’ve previously labeled a fake news site.

In Milwaukee op-ed, Donald Trump overstates economic impact of Ronald Reagan corporate tax rate cut
","To reach what a White House spokesman called ""the heartland of America,"" President Donald Trump wrote an opinion article for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that called on Congress to pass his tax reform bill. In the Sept. 3, 2017 op-ed, Trump invoked a Republican famous for tax cutting to argue that his own proposed cuts would spur economic growth. Trump wrote: In 1986, President Ronald Reagan led the effort to make America the most competitive nation in the world by cutting our business tax rate to 34 percent, well below the average rate of other developed nations at the time. It worked. Our economy boomed, the middle class thrived and median family income increased. As we’ll see, some economists say Reagan’s reduction in the corporate tax rate helped boost the economy. But seven experts we spoke to were unanimous in saying that a single tax cut can’t be credited for making dramatic gains in an economy that is affected by a whole host of taxes, as well as many factors not related to taxes, such as demographics and trade policies. ""Mathematically, he’s on firm ground"" in terms of economic growth and increases in median income in the years after the corporate rate cut, Manhattan Institute senior fellow Brian Riedl said of Trump’s claim. But attributing those gains to one cut is something else. ""It’s always very hard to specify which policies led the economy to perform the way it did,"" Riedl said. Said University of Wisconsin-Madison professor emeritus of applied economics Andrew Reschovsky, who worked in the Office of Tax Analysis at the U.S. Treasury: ""The problem is, economies are complex things. It is really impossible to attribute any change"" in the economy to a single tax cut. Trump’s evidence To back Trump’s claim about the effects of the 1986 corporate tax rate cut, the White House cited several statistics indicating the economy improved during the next several years. Among them: A 4.2 percent increase in gross domestic product in 1988, according to the World Bank; and an increase of nearly $2,000 -- from $51,388 to $53,367 -- in the real median household income, from 1986 to 1989. But there are two important points to consider here, the economists told us. 1. The corporate tax rate cut -- from 46 percent to 34 percent -- was only one of a host of cuts made in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. As Americans for Tax Reform recalled in celebrating the Reagan bill, the legislation also reduced the top marginal individual income tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent and slashed the total number of income brackets from 14 to two, among many other tax changes. As the Washington Post reported, ""tax shelters for the wealthy, which proliferated before the bill became law, were struck a mortal blow,"" the ""once-all-powerful oil-and-gas lobby also had a few of its tax benefits clipped"" and ""millions of low-income Americans were taken off the income tax rolls entirely.""

A corporate rate tax cut can help grow the economy and raise wages, said American Enterprise Institute economics policy resident scholar Aparna Mathur, whose specialties include tax policy and corporate taxation. But  ""it’s really hard to pin down"" cause and effect, or to determine how much improvement they yield, she said. Bruce Bartlett, a domestic policy adviser in the Reagan White House, was more critical of Trump’s claim. ""The economy did not boom. It grew at about the same rate as before the tax reform and by 1990 was tanking,"" he told us. University of California, Berkeley economist Alan Auerbach, the author of an American Economic Association journal article on the economic effects of the 1986 tax reform law, gave a more positive view. ""The economy did OK after 1986 until the 1990-91 recession, but there was no significant change in the economy's overall trajectory immediately after the 1986 act,"" he said. ""The economy did boom in the mid- to late-1990s, and the middle class did relatively well during that period, but it's hard to attribute that to the 1986 act."" And much more difficult to attribute, as Trump did, any economic gains to only the corporate tax rate cut among the broader package of 1986 tax reforms. 2. Many factors aside from taxes help determine the performance of the economy. Mathur said factors such as immigration and trade also affect the economy.   While the economy improved after the various 1986 Reagan tax changes, ""you had a lot of winds behind the sails,"" said Tax Policy Center former co-director Eugene Steuerle, who was deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury for Tax Analysis under Reagan. He cited baby boomers reaching their peak earning years and more women entering the workforce. Said Cato Institute senior fellow Daniel Mitchell, whose specialties include fiscal policy and tax reform: ""One could certainly make an argument the (corporate tax rate cut) was good for growth, it was good for the middle class -- but lots of other things are, too."" To claim major economic gains were fueled only by the corporate cut, he said, ""is puffery."" Our rating In a Journal Sentinel op-ed, Trump said: ""In 1986, President Ronald Reagan"" cut the business tax rate to 34 percent and ""it worked -- our economy boomed, the middle class thrived and median family income increased."" Some economists say the corporate rate reduction, from 46 percent, did help lead to economic growth and higher income. But it wasn’t necessarily any more important than a cut -- from 50 percent to 28 percent -- in the top individual income tax rate that was part of the same 1986 package that included other tax changes, as well. More importantly, many other factors beyond tax cuts -- demographics, immigration, trade policy and more -- bear on the economy. Trump’s statement contains only an element of truth -- our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDD56C0>],/factchecks/2017/sep/06/donald-trump/milwaukee-op-ed-donald-trump-overstates-economic-i/

Testing Sean Duffy claim that 'We're flying 1987 planes with 1987 technology'
","With House Republicans shifting from health care to tax reform and the budget, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy recently argued for an increase in military spending, claiming the U.S. military’s air fleet is antiquated and leaves the nation at risk. Duffy’s push for more military spending came during a July 20, 2017, interview on The World Over with Raymond Arroyo on EWTN, days before Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed in the U.S. Senate. Duffy’s claim arose from a question by Arroyo about whether the U.S. spends too much on defense. Duffy (R-Wisconsin) responded with a firm ""no,"" then rattled off a series of familiar talking points about the nation’s military: the military is depleted; there’s peace through strength; and it’s vital to stay ahead of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. To drive his message home, he made a very specific claim about the U.S. air fleet. ""We're flying 1987 planes with 1987 technology,"" Duffy said. Duffy’s wider point about a depleted military is one PolitiFact has addressed in fact checks of other politicians, such as Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan. In this item, we’ll look at whether the U.S. is really flying planes from 1987 that have 1987 technology and what that says about the state of the military. Aging aircraft In 2015, Duffy did a fly-along in an F-16 with the Wisconsin Air National Guard’s 115th Fighter Wing in Madison. On the visit, staffers from the Air National Guard told him the planes were built in 1987 and had 1987 technology, aides to Duffy told us. ""He received that information from the Wisconsin Air National Guard and took their professional guidance on the matter,"" said Duffy spokesman Mark Bednar. Capt. Joe Trovato, deputy director of public affairs for the Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs, confirmed the fly-along happened and that Duffy recalled the conversation correctly. The F-16’s assigned to that specific fighter wing were built between 1986 and 1988, with the bulk in 1987. The conversation, however, was specifically about the F-16 and how peer or near-peer nations such as China and Russia are catching up and can match or exceed F-16 technology. In the EWTN interview, Duffy offered a broad statement about the nation’s military aircraft, without limiting it to specific planes or providing a sense of how many planes may fit the criteria. In any case, there is more to the story. The body and engines on the F-16’s in question remain largely the same as they did when they rolled off the assembly line. But in the years since, the government has upgraded weapons, sensors and software on the planes, Trovato said. For instance, they now have better GPS locator systems and better weapons and munitions. The aerospace policy experts we spoke with agreed with Duffy’s general sentiment, but said it passes over important context, such as the upgrades to the fighters. ""These older aircraft have been upgraded and modernized over time,"" said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies -- a nonpartisan Washington, D.C., think tank. ""While the airframe may be old, the cockpit, navigation systems, sensors, and other electronics have been modernized. ""An F-16 flying today is much more capable and technologically advanced than when it rolled off the assembly line in the 1980s."" Still, Harrison and others said, there are limits to the upgrades: The F-16 can’t be upgraded to have the stealth capabilities common in the much newer F-22 Raptors or F-35 Lightnings. Laura McAndrews, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Air Force, said in an email that the average age of aircraft in the Air Force is 27, and fighter and attack aircraft specifically have an average age of 25. Typically, when the military wants to introduce a new generation of aircraft, it can take two decades to get an aircraft from the conceptual stage to test stage and finally full integration into the nation’s air fleet, according to Harrison and other policy experts. The F-22 Raptors, which first got off the ground in tests in the 1990s, are among the most recent additions. The Air Force has 183 of them, according to fact sheets. The F-35 Lightnings, a program started in 2001, are part of a controversial $400 billion order that, over 20 years, aims to replace aging aircraft across three branches of the military, according to the Department of Defense. Our rating  Duffy said, ""We're flying 1987 planes with 1987 technology."" In the case of the airplanes Duffy based his claim on, the engine and body remain largely the same as in 1987, but experts and the military say the F-16 has undergone other technological upgrades. In addition, Duffy’s statement is more general, which ignores ongoing efforts to modernize the fleet and purchase and design new craft.

Jeff Sessions' questionable claim that DACA helped cause spike in minors at border
","During his announcement that the Trump administration would phase out Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, Attorney General Jeff Sessions blamed the Obama-era policy for a surge in unaccompanied minors at the southern U.S. border that spiked in 2014. Speaking from prepared remarks at the Justice Department, Sessions said that DACA, ""among other things, contributed to a surge of minors at the southern border that yielded terrible humanitarian consequences."" Did DACA really help spawn the surge of minors from Central America? Based on statistical patterns and consultation with experts, we find the evidence to be weak. ""As far as I can see, there is no logical or empirical linkage between DACA and the child migrants from Central America,"" said Douglas Massey, a Princeton University sociologist who has written about and done field work with immigrants on the southern border. Under DACA, enacted as an executive-branch policy in 2012, undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States before turning 16 could apply for a renewable status that protected them from deportation as long as they met several requirements. They needed to be in school, have a high school degree or be an honorably discharged veteran. They had to be younger than 31 by June 15, 2012. They had to have no significant criminal record. And -- most relevant for analyzing Sessions’ claim -- they had to have lived in the United States continuously since June 15, 2007. This residency requirement meant that none of the unaccompanied minors showing up at the southern border of the United States in 2014 would have qualified for DACA. Most of the unaccompanied minors came from Central America, particularly Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. By definition, they would not have been living in the United States continuously since 2007. But what if the migrants were under the belief that the United States would welcome them? The Justice Department pointed us to an article published in the Washington Post on June 13, 2014, headlined, ""Influx of minors across Texas border driven by belief that they will be allowed to stay in U.S."" According to the Post, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said that while on a tour of a Border Patrol station in Nogales, Ariz., that was housing hundreds of unaccompanied minors, her aides found that ""many of the children were smuggled across the border after hearing radio ads promising they would not be deported. My staff also heard that religious organizations are spreading the same message."" The Post went on to cite a leaked memo written by Border Patrol agents that had been circulated to reporters and lawmakers by the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for limited immigration. It was based on interviews with 230 youths and women from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. The memo said many migrants wanted ""to take advantage of the ‘new’ U.S. law that grants a free pass or permit"" from the government. ""The news of these ‘permisos’ is spread by word of mouth and international and local media,"" the memo said. Then-Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told Congress that he disagreed with the memo’s conclusions, though the Post noted that Cecilia Muñoz, the Obama White House’s director of domestic policy, acknowledged that unfounded ""rumors"" could be playing a role in the influx of minors, though not as the leading cause. So how did these ""rumors"" arise? As we’ve previously written, the most likely explanation is that Central Americans turned themselves in to immigration authorities in order to seek asylum protection. To apply for asylum, individuals must be physically present in the United States and can do so regardless of how they arrived or of their current immigration status. It’s important to note that asylum policy is an entirely different aspect of the immigration framework than DACA. As we’ve noted, some of the policies that governed unaccompanied minors stem from the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, a broadly bipartisan measure signed by President George W. Bush in 2008. So for Sessions to use the situation with unaccompanied minors as a justification for ending DACA is to target one set of rules for the consequences of another. Is it conceivable that people in Central America might have heard about DACA and used it as one more data point to reinforce a perception that the United States was growing more welcome to immigrants, and that they should try to send their unaccompanied children here? Yes. Still, even that doesn’t mean that the DACA policy itself ""contributed to a surge of minors at the southern border"" -- only that misperceptions and unfounded rumors in foreign countries about DACA did. The DACA policy itself would have done Central American migrants no good once they got to the border. And even if it sounds plausible that DACA may have accidentally helped spawn the surge in unaccompanied minors, the timeline undercuts that notion. Let’s first look at Border Patrol apprehensions at the Southwest border -- a metric often used as a rough estimate of the number of people attempting to cross the border into the United States. DACA was announced near the end of the 2012 fiscal year. (The graph above uses fiscal rather than calendar years.) So if DACA prompted a spike in the number of unaccompanied minors, that should show up in the data starting in 2013. In reality, while the number of apprehensions did increase, it did so steadily -- as if DACA had never happened. The slope of the increase is consistent from 2011 to 2014, after which it fell. (It’s also less than a third of the level it was in 2000.) A second data set also calls into question Sessions’ linkage -- data showing non-Mexican apprehensions at the Southwest border. While not all of these apprehensions involved Central Americans, they are considered a pretty good approximation. This time, the scale of the spike is bigger, but the data shows the same general pattern. That is, the number goes up at a more-or-less steady rate between 2011 and 2014, before declining. So, for both data sets, the increase was steady -- and it began more than a year before DACA was even implemented. ""We have no data that links DACA with increases in apprehensions of unaccompanied minors at the southwestern border,"" said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew Research Center who studies immigration. Why did they come then? To flee violence, primarily. Denise Gilman, director of the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, pointed to a 2014 study by Vanderbilt University’s Latin American Public Opinion Project. It surveyed residents of the three main Central American countries about their intentions to migrate and whether they had been victimized by crime in the previous 12 months. The study found that those who had been victimized were considerably more likely to consider migration than those who had not been victimized. In Honduras, for instance, 28 percent of non-victims reported having intentions to migrate, compared to almost 56 percent of those victimized more than once by crime. Other analyses have agreed about the importance of crime, along with poverty. An August 2016 Congressional Research Service report we’ve cited concluded that gang-related violence, poverty and lack of educational and employment opportunities in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras played a key role in children’s decisions to leave their homes on their own and cross illegally into the United States. ""We believe what has largely motivated migration of unaccompanied minors and families from Central America has been a combination of ‘push’ factors -- violence, instability and endemic poverty in Central America -- coupled with ‘pull’ factors -- a desire to reunite with family in the U.S. and an understanding that people from Central America presenting themselves at the border would be allowed in, pending review of their case in immigration court,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute, which is generally favorable toward immigration. Sessions said that DACA ""contributed to a surge of minors at the southern border."" Since the DACA policy itself didn’t address the situation of unaccompanied Central American minors at all, the only way it could have had any effect was through mistaken understandings among potential migrants in Central America about what the program did and didn’t do. While there is evidence that such mistaken ideas did exist, the data shows that the upticks at the southern border were already under way by the time DACA was announced, and that the trend line didn’t change significantly after the announcement. So the effect, if there was any at all, would have been too small to measure.
