Arizona Rep: The cost of 2 National Guard border arrests would help a homeless vet for a year
","President Donald Trump’s decision to send National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border has drawn a mixed response. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey welcomed the move, while California Gov. Jerry Brown’s National Guard said it would ""review"" the request. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., had a specific complaint: He said it was a poor use of tax dollars. ""Using the National Guard to do border security is very expensive,"" Gallego tweeted April 3. ""For what it would cost the Guard to make just TWO arrests at the border, we could give a homeless veteran permanent housing for an entire year."" Using the National Guard to do border security is very expensive. For what it would cost the Guard to make just TWO arrests at the border, we could give a homeless veteran permanent housing for an entire year. Gallego’s office said they had the numbers to back that up and pointed to several news articles. We went to government reports and filings for the data, and with a caveat about who actually makes arrests at the border, the statement checks out. In 2012, the U.S. Government Accountability Office examined the costs and benefits of deploying National Guard troops at the border. The auditing arm of Congress had two examples to study. Operation Jump Start ran from June 2006 to July 2008 under President George W. Bush. President Barack Obama initiated Operation Phalanx between July 2010 and September 2011. There were slight differences in the Guard’s activities. For example, Operation Jump Start involved aviation while Operation Phalanx did not. But by and large, they operated under the same rules. The guardsmen helped spot illegal border crossers, while Customs and Border Patrol officers made the actual arrests. So, to be clear, while Gallego referred to arrests, the National Guardsmen arrested no one. The Defense Department told the GAO that the combined cost of both operations for the National Guard was $1.35 billion. CBP officials reported that the National Guard assisted in the apprehension of 186,814 undocumented aliens under Jump Start, and the apprehension of 17,887 under Phalanx. (Technically, the National Guard operated under Title 32 of the U.S. code. The Defense Department provided assistance separately under Title 10 status. The spending figures reflect the distinction.) The cost per apprehension was $6,595. Trump’s memorandum called for the Secretary of Defense to request the use of the Guard under Title 32. In September 2017, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced the latest round of funding to provide veterans with housing vouchers. It offered about $40 million to ""support approximately 5,500 units."" That comes to nearly $7,300 per unit. The advocacy group National Coalition for Homeless Veterans uses a higher estimate. ""The cost of providing permanent supportive housing and case management for a homeless veteran tends to average around $10,000 per person per year,"" said coalition spokesman Randy Brown. Brown said the price tag would vary from place to place and cited a 2014 report from Central Florida Commission on Homelessness that said housing and support services for any chronically homeless person would cost $10,051 per year. The Trump administration has provided too few details on the proposed deployment to allow a precise cost estimate. But based on past experience, the cost of two apprehensions with National Guard assistance would be $13,190. That is about 30 percent more than the higher estimate to provide permanent housing used by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans. If we use the government funding level of $7,300 for housing, the apprehension price tag rises to 80 percent more than housing a homeless veteran for a year. It’s possible that the Trump administration could reduce costs, although a few pieces would need to fall into place. As the Government Accountability Office noted, the National Guardsman were not allowed to arrest people, which increased the number of people needed to apprehend a border crosser. In theory, that could change. ""Under Title 32, the governors of those states can authorize troops to perform civil law enforcement, such as apprehending and arresting people,"" said Leigh M. Winstead with the Veterans and Servicemembers Legal Clinic at George Mason University. Some governors might take that step, but others might not. Winstead said precedent likely allows the president to overrule a governor who refuses, but there could be a legal challenge. In short, while we have credible financial information from the past, the cost of the proposed operation remains unknown. Gallego said that the cost of using the National Guard to arrest two people at the border would cover the expense of providing permanent housing to a homeless veteran for a year. Based on past experience, government reports back up Gallego’s comparison. Using data gathered by the Government Accounting Office, National Guard-assisted apprehensions cost $6,595 on average, or about $13,000 for two. According to a homeless vet advocacy group, the cost of providing a home to a veteran is about $10,000, although the government uses a lower figure of $7,300. It is unclear whether the proposed operation would allow the National Guard to make arrests, and whether that would significantly lower the cost per apprehension. However, that effect would need to be large to overcome the gap based on the historic figures. With the caveat about who makes the arrests, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/apr/05/ruben-gallego/arizona-rep-cost-2-national-guard-border-arrests-w/

No, Chuck Schumer didn't say it is racist to only allow citizens to vote
","A blog took U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer’s op-ed about voting rights and twisted it to state that he supported allowing non-citizens to vote. ""Chuck Schumer slams President Trump: ‘it’s racist to only allow citizens to vote,"" said an April 3 headline on Federer Now, a right-wing blog.

We found that the story, which appeared to be lifted from other websites, distorted what Schumer actually said about voting rights. While readers of the blog could assume that the statements by Schumer were recent, they actually came from his Aug. 24, 2017, Medium post in which he called on Trump to disband his Election Integrity Commission. Trump formed the commission in 2017 in an effort to ferret out voter fraud which Trump portrayed as ""large scale,"" even though national experts have said fraud is isolated and rare. Trump disbanded the commission in January 2018 after pushback from many states, infighting on the commission and multiple lawsuits. The Federer Now blog plucked some actual quotes by Schumer from his Medium post including this one: ""If the president wants to truly show that he rejects the discrimination agenda of the white supremacist movement, he will rescind the Executive Order that created this commission."" But then the blog made some declarations about Schumer’s opinions, which were not rooted in fact. For example it said that Schumer ""has declared restricting voting to only Americans as an exercise in racism. "" Schumer’s Medium post made no mention of restricting voting to citizens. The point of Schumer’s op-ed was to argue that voting rights are ""under assault"" by Trump and many states and that such laws are racist and an effort to disenfranchise minority voters. Schumer described Trump’s Election Integrity Commission as an ""effort to intimidate voters and purge them from the rolls."" Schumer spokesman Matt House told PolitiFact that Schumer hasn’t called for allowing non-citizens to vote.

Did NC Republican oppose funding for border wall?
","The Republican primary in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District has become a race to the right. Ads by incumbent Rep. Robert Pittenger greatly exaggerated his opponent’s short-lived opposition to Donald Trump before Trump became president. His opponent, Mark Harris, falsely accused Pittenger of being one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress. Now, Harris is criticizing Pittenger’s vote on a recent spending bill. ""Robert Pittenger stood against funding for the border wall,"" Harris posted on his Facebook page. The post goes on to say that Pittenger and others ""left our President out on an island. The vote on the spending bill that funded almost every liberal priority from the left, did NOT include the money requested by our President to build the wall on the southern border."" Harris is referring to a $1.3 trillion bill Congress passed on March 22 to fund the federal government and avoid a shutdown. The legislation, known as an omnibus bill, combines several issues into a single package. PolitiFact contacted the Harris campaign about their claim that Pittenger opposed funding for the border wall. Harris spokesman Jason Williams responded by email and referenced a March 2017 story where Pittenger is quoted saying he believes the wall is a euphemism. That means he thinks Trump’s use of the word ""wall"" alludes to broad efforts to secure the southern border — not necessarily a single barrier. Williams also pointed to a March 21 article in The Atlantic, in which anonymous sources are quoted saying that Trump is upset that the bill didn’t fully fund the wall. ""There are a number of articles that report the President’s dismay over lack of funding for the border wall,"" Williams wrote. ""There is some funding for some fencing and some border security, but not the actual construction of the wall itself."" Pittenger, for his part, said ""as Chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, I have always been in favor of building a wall and securing our porous southern border,"" he said in a statement. ""The FY2018 omnibus and earlier legislation I supported clearly provides funding to begin construction, and President Trump himself tweeted that ‘much can be done with the $1.6 billion given to building and fixing the border wall.’ Mark Harris cannot continue to have it both ways. Either he supports President Trump, as I have done consistently with a 97 percent pro-Trump voting record, or he doesn't. The facts are very clear."" What the bill funds The Harris campaign has a point about what the bill funds. As PolitiFact recently noted, the bill provides funding for projects that improve or replace fencing, but doesn’t fund any of the eight border wall prototypes ordered by the Trump administration. In total, the omnibus bill includes $1.5 billion for physical barriers and ""associated technology"" along the southwest border, according to a memo from Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. ""This amount provides for more than 90 miles of ‘border wall system,’ going beyond the administration’s budget request for 74 miles"" this fiscal year, Frelinghuysen wrote in the memo. The 2,232-page document specifies $251 million for 14 miles of ""secondary fencing"" along the southwest border near San Diego and a total of $641 million for border fencing near the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. Even more specifically, the bill funds 33 miles of barriers in Hidalgo and Starr counties, the McAllen Monitor reported. In an interview with Fox News, House Speaker Paul Ryan elaborated on how the funding amount was determined. ""Here is the deal on the border. We asked the border patrol: 'What do you need on the border?' What they tell us is, the conditions on the ground determine what kind of wall they want, different types in different places,"" Ryan said. ""For instance, they want concrete barrier with a fence on top, with earth behind it in the Rio Grande Valley so it doesn't get washed away in floods,"" he continued. ""In the desert they want a see-through wall, so they can see what is going on through it. So we do that."" Pittenger and the wall Harris’ broader argument is that Pittenger stood against Trump by not funding the wall to a level that Trump desired. However, Pittenger has been one of Trump’s most consistent supporters. Last July, Pittenger voted for a $790 billion spending bill that would’ve funded border security to the tune of $1.57 billion. (So did some of the same Republican Congressmen who described the recent bill’s $1.6 billion in border funding as too low) Pittenger again aligned himself with Trump on immigration as recently as last October. He said the first step toward immigration reform is securing the border. ""This includes building a physical barrier along our porous southern border,"" Pittenger wrote in a column published by TheCharlotteWeekly.com. ""Any attempt to fix immigration will fail without first stopping the flow of illegal immigrants."" Pittenger has a record of supporting Trump and Trump’s agenda. So it’s disingenuous to say that Pittenger ""stood against"" funding for a border wall simply because he supported a bill that doesn’t fully fund the wall’s full construction – a bill which Trump, himself, wavered on. Trump and the bill Trump’s public stance on the bill wasn’t consistent. On March 21, Trump tweeted: ""Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming."" Later the same day, he again boasted on Twitter that he ""had to fight for Military and start of Wall."" Then, on March 23, Trump tweeted that he was considering vetoing the omnibus bill, ""based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded."" According to Vox, Trump’s demand for full-funding of the wall was a ""last minute"" request. The day before Trump tweeted his criticism of the bill, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney acknowledged that the administration didn’t get everything it wanted in the bill. But, Mulvaney said, the bill included ""more money than requested for technology and facilities"" and that the White House was generally happy with the immigration provisions. ""We asked for 74 miles worth of wall, we got 100,"" budget director Mick Mulvaney told Fox News. ""Not exactly what we wanted, where we wanted. Congress chose to ignore some of the suggestions that [Customs and Border Protection] made on where the best kind of wall should go and that's unfortunate."" Trump then signed the bill and promptly began touting funding for the wall, saying construction would start immediately after signing the bill. ""We have a lot money coming to the border, and it will be coming over a period of time,"" Trump said. ""We funded the initial down payment of $1.6 billion. We’re going to be starting work – literally – on Monday on not only some new wall ... but also fixing existing walls."" On March 25, Trump tweeted, ""Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall. It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately. The rest of the money will come - and remember DACA, the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)!"" Our ruling Harris said Pittenger ""stood against funding for the border wall."" Harris bases this claim on the idea that Trump wanted more money for the wall than Pittenger and other Republicans ultimately gave him. But just because Pittenger voted for a bill that doesn’t fully fund the wall doesn’t mean he stood against funding or doesn’t support the idea. PolitiFact found no evidence that Pittenger worked to block wall funding, so we rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2018/apr/05/mark-harris-nc/did-nc-republican-oppose-funding-border-wall/

Headline falsely says Rep. Steve King facing arrest after comment about Emma Gonzalez and Cuba
","A misleading headline on Facebook says that U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, faces arrest after attacking Parkland survivor Emma Gonzalez for wearing a jacket with the Cuban flag. ""Congressman just annihilated Parkland ‘victim’ in calling her out -- now he’s facing arrest!"" said a March 29 headline on Political Thinkers, a conservative website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that King faces arrest. The Political Thinkers story pertains to King’s campaign Facebook post criticizing Gonzalez for wearing a Cuban flag patch on her jacket while giving a speech during the March For Our Lives rally in Washington. ""This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,"" King's post said. According to Univision, Gonzalez’s father arrived in New York from Cuba in 1968. Some media reports and U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Miami, pushed back at King’s statements and noted that it’s common for Cuban-Americans in Miami to display the Cuban flag, which is not a sign of support for Castro. The Political Thinker website pointed to a memo by the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, which asked the House Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate King’s ""unethical, xenophobic and racist Facebook post."" The complaint by the anti-Trump organization drew scant media attention, and such ethics complaints often lead to no such action. Brett Kappel is a government affairs partner at the Akerman law firm who has represented members of Congress but not King. He said the Office of Congressional Ethics has dismissed roughly half of all complaints it has received since its inception. Of the 50 percent that were referred by the office to the House Ethics Committee, the vast majority were either dismissed by the Ethics Committee or the Ethics Committee took no action because the accused left the House due to resignation, retirement or to run for another office. ""It would be extraordinarily rare for an OCE complaint to result in a criminal arrest, much less a conviction – but it is possible,"" he said, speaking in general about such cases, and not the one specifically about King. Kappel said that if the complaint is that King used campaign funds to hire family members, ""that’s perfectly legal as long as the family members are paid the fair market value for the services they provide the campaign."" The Office of Congressional Ethics doesn’t confirm tips it receives. However, any entity can file such requests, and the Office doesn’t need such submissions to launch an investigation. Bottom line: the fact that the group said in a memo that it asked the office to investigate King doesn’t mean that the office will investigate King. We reached out to King’s campaign and congressional office and did not get a reply for this fact-check. At a meeting hosted by a conservative club in Iowa days after his Facebook post, King said the post was intended to highlight the ""irony"" of a person of Cuban heritage advocating for gun control given that the communist government restricted possession of weapons. A headline on Political Thinkers about King said that ""Congressman just annihilated Parkland ‘victim’ in calling her out -- now he’s facing arrest!"" While King’s comments about Gonzalez wearing a patch of the Cuban flag prompted a left-leaning group to file a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics, such complaints often lead to no action. It would be extraordinarily rare for any such complaint to the ethics office to lead to arrest, and there is no evidence that King faces arrest.

How far has U.S. manufacturing employment fallen?
","There’s no question that manufacturing employment in the United States has fallen in recent decades. But did a Republican congressman from West Virginia get it right when he cited a statistic on that point in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed? U.S. Rep. Alex Mooney wrote March 25 that ""from 2000-10, U.S. manufacturing employment shrank by a third after holding steady for 30 years."" Mooney was broadly accurate when looking at raw employment totals. But the point does not hold up when you factor in population growth — a more telling statistic. (Mooney’s staff did not respond to inquiries for this article.) First, let’s look at the raw numbers. The number of U.S. manufacturing employees bounced around in a fairly narrow range between 1970 and 2000, before plunging between 2000 and 2010. (Left out by Mooney: National manufacturing employment has risen modestly but consistently since 2010.) So that’s in line with what Mooney wrote. But if you adjust for the surge in U.S. population between 1970 and today, the pattern looks different. Rather than ""holding steady for 30 years,"" the percentage of Americans working in manufacturing actually fell consistently between 1970 and 2000. The rate of decline accelerated a bit between 2000 and 2010, but not by much. And the percentage of Americans working in manufacturing has stabilized, and actually increased slightly, since 2010. Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, agreed that the pattern depends heavily on which measure you use. ""Measured as a percentage of total employment, manufacturing employment has been falling pretty steadily since World War II,"" he said. ""The growth in manufacturing labor productivity, the growth of imported manufactured products as a share of the manufactured goods we consume, and the shift in consumers’ taste away from manufactured goods toward services -- especially health care services -- has meant that we do not need as many U.S. manufacturing employees to produce all the manufactured goods we consume in a given year."" We were curious how the pattern looked for West Virginia. It turns out that manufacturing jobs in West Virginia did remain pretty constant prior to 2000 before falling off a cliff. Manufacturing jobs as a percentage of West Virginia’s population held steady between 1990 and 2000, then dropped significantly between 2000 and 2010. As with the other measures, manufacturing employment as a percentage of the state’s population has remained strikingly stable since 2010. Mooney wrote that ""from 2000-10, U.S. manufacturing employment shrank by a third after holding steady for 30 years."" Mooney’s statistic is accurate in raw numbers. The one caveat is if you measure manufacturing employment as a percentage of the population — which accounts for significant population growth over that period — you can see a steady decline going back decades. Manufacturing’s footprint in the labor market shrank consistently, and by more than half, during the period he cited.

Donald Trump wrongly claims border wall is under construction
","President Donald Trump claimed his administration has kicked off one of his landmark campaign promises: the construction of a border wall with Mexico. ""We have to have strong borders. We need the wall. We’ve started building the wall, as you know, we have a $1.6 billion toward building the wall and fixing existing wall that’s falling down, it was never appropriate in the first place,"" Trump said standing next to Baltic leaders during an April 3 press conference. Trump made similar remarks in Ohio on March 29: ""We started building our wall. I'm so proud of it. We started. … We have $1.6 billion."" And on March 28 tweeted pictures of construction work at the border and wrote, ""Great briefing this afternoon on the start of our Southern Border WALL!"" Great briefing this afternoon on the start of our Southern Border WALL! pic.twitter.com/pmCNoxxlkH Trump’s words leave the impression that construction is underway for the border wall he promised, and that $1.6 billion is helping pay for it. That’s not the case. There are projects underway along parts of the border to improve or replace fencing, but none of that includes any of the eight border wall prototypes ordered by the Trump administration. In fact, U.S. Customs and Border Protection told PolitiFact this week that a prototype has not been selected. The White House did not respond on the record to our request for comment. Trump reluctantly signed a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill on March 23 that he threatened to veto in part because his promised border wall was ""not fully funded."" The bill included $1.6 billion for some projects at the border, but none of that can be used toward the border wall promised during the presidential campaign. The bill said the designated funds ""shall only be available for operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017"" (May 5, 2017), ""such as currently deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety."" The specific uses are: • $251 million for approximately 14 miles of secondary fencing along the southwest border in the San Diego sector; • $445 million for 25 miles of primary pedestrian levee fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector; • $196 million for primary pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector; • $445 million for replacement of existing primary pedestrian fencing along the southwest border; • $38 million for border barrier planning and design; and • $196 million for acquisition and deployment of border security technology ""This is replacing and improving existing fences,"" said Sanho Tree, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning think tank. According to Los Angeles Times reporting, the photos Trump shared in his March 28 tweet about ""the start of our southern border WALL"" were for the replacement of an estimated 2.25-mile border wall in Calexico, Calif., built in the 1990s using recycled scraps of metal and old landing mat. That barrier is being replaced with a 30-foot high bollard-style wall. Plans for that replacement began in 2009 and were funded in 2017, the newspaper reported. The Los Angeles Times quoted Jonathan Pacheco, a spokesman for the Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector as having said earlier in March: ""First and foremost, this isn’t Trump’s wall. This isn’t the infrastructure that Trump is trying to bring in. … This new wall replacement has absolutely nothing to do with the prototypes that were shown over in the San Diego area."" Customs and Border Protection issued a news release March 30 headlined, ""Border Wall Construction Underway."" The release said the $1.6 billion funding would provide for the construction of about 100 miles of new border wall. It uses the term ""border wall"" to refer to fencing and other structures, not the prototypes Trump has touted. It highlights, among other construction, the 20-mile replacement of primary vehicle barrier in Santa Teresa, N.M.; the replacement in San Diego of 14 miles of outdated steel plate barrier with a bollard structure; the replacement of at least two miles of border barrier in Calexico with 30-foot bollard wall; and four miles of bollard wall in El Paso. ""We’re building 35 new gates along a stretch of 55 miles of existing border wall,"" acting deputy commissioner Ronald Vitiello said in the release. Trump's claim ""not only conflates walls and fences, but also plays into Trump's false narrative that there are not already barriers along much of the border,"" said Hannah R. Gurman, a clinical associate professor at New York University who has researched the history of U.S. immigration enforcement and its intersection with criminal prosecution. As far as the prototypes go, it’s uncertain if one of them will be built at the border as designed. The Department of Homeland Security ""does not anticipate"" that a single prototype will be selected as the design standard for future border wall construction, said Customs and Border Protection spokesman Carlos Diaz. ""Rather, the eight different prototypes are each anticipated to inform future border wall design standards in some capacity,"" Diaz told PolitiFact April 2. Diaz said the agency has tested, assessed and evaluated the prototypes to determine which of them most effectively stops illegal crossings. Evaluators have proposed new features to add to CBP’s ""toolkit"" of border wall designs, Diaz said. PolitiFact’s Trump-O-Meter is tracking Trump’s promise to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it. It rates In the Works because the promise has been proposed or is being considered. Trump said, ""We’ve started building the wall."" There are projects underway to replace existing border fencing and to add some new barriers. But it’s disingenuous to claim they amount to the border wall Trump has long promised. A recent appropriation of $1.6 billion allows the replacement of existing fencing, but not the construction of any sort of wall prototype.

Did Florida police seize a man's gun with out due process? No
","After the Parkland school shooting, Florida lawmakers passed a so-called ""red flag"" law that aims to keep guns out of the hands of people deemed to be a threat to others or themselves. The new law went into effect March 9, quickly stoking concern among people about lost freedom. A March 18 headline posted on the Free Thought Project said, ""It begins: Florida police now confiscating guns from people with no due process."" The post went on to say a man in Lighthouse Point — in Broward County, like Parkland — had his guns taken away before he was determined to be mentally unfit and before he was accused of a crime, making him the first person in the state to ""have his due process removed."" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The post makes it seem like a man’s guns were taken without reason or cause, but that leaves out important nuance about the situation. Authorities said the man voluntarily surrendered his weapons and never contested the temporary risk protection order barring him from his guns for up to a year. Florida legislators moved quickly to pass SB 7026, allowing law enforcement to seek a risk protection order from a judge that would temporarily remove a person’s firearm(s) for up to a year. It also bars those individuals from buying guns during that time. Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri took issue with the way the law has been portrayed in headlines. He said if a person doesn’t comply with a risk protection order, then police have to file a warrant and establish probable cause to obtain the weapon. ""There is no seizure authority,"" Gualtieri said. ""You can ask them to comply with the risk protection order, but you can’t seize a person’s guns."" The law slightly amended the Baker Act, under which law enforcement officials can take someone against their will to a facility for a mental health evaluation if the person is a danger to themselves or others. Authorities can confiscate a person’s guns if they pose a potential danger to themselves or have made a credible threat of violence against another person. Before this change, the Baker Act didn’t state whether guns should be taken or returned, except to ban guns from hospitals providing mental health services. In practice, officers would often — but not always — temporarily confiscate guns if the firearms were on the person or in plain sight during the Baker Act ""episode,"" said Martha Lenderman, an expert on the Baker Act. More states added similar ""red flag"" laws this year including Washington. Matt Agorist, who wrote the Free Thought Project article, argued that Florida’s new law allows law enforcement officers to retain guns without due process. ""When a person is stripped of their constitutional rights, albeit temporarily, without being given the chance to make their own case based on what can be entirely arbitrary accusations, this is the removal of due process,"" Agorist said in an email to PolitiFact Florida. However, this neglects the fact that the person in question allowed police to retain his guns at the time he was taken into custody under the Baker Act. After this, Lighthouse Point police took the necessary steps to obtain a temporary risk protection order, which a judge reviewed and signed. PolitiFact Florida interviewed Lighthouse Point Police Chief Ross Licata and Broward County’s chief judge to get an understanding of the incident that led to a 56-year-old man losing his weapons. Licata said officers have had interactions with the man for years, but it wasn’t until early March that his actions warranted action. (PolitiFact Florida is not naming the man because of his condition.) On March 7, Lighthouse Point Police checked on the man at his condo after an anonymous person filed a complaint that he was acting strangely. According to court records, the person said the man had been seen around the community ""clutching his face and hair while arguing with himself."" The complainant also said the man had admitted to turning off the main electrical breakers to the condo building ""to prevent them from sending electrical impulses through his body and controlling him."" Licata said that this was causing a safety issue for other residents who depend on oxygen. During the police welfare check, the man said he was being targeted by one of his neighbors, who he said shape-shifts and looks like Osama bin Laden. The man was carrying a firearm in the outer pocket of his cargo pants, according to court records. The man voluntarily surrendered his weapons during the welfare check, said Broward’s chief administrative judge, Circuit Judge Jack Tuter. After that, police determined the man was a risk to himself and others and took him into custody under the Baker Act. Licata said the subject was not released from the medical center until March 21. Before he was released, police petitioned the court to get a temporary ex parte order and a permanent risk protection order March 14 to retain the man’s guns. (An ex parte orders allows the court to proceed temporarily without both parties present for a hearing. In this case, the man was still being held at a medical facility.) Law enforcement met with the man at his condo March 21 to remove additional ammunition. One week after his release, there was a final hearing to determine if the guns and ammunition should be removed for one year. The man was there. He did not contest the one-year risk protection order requested by police. Tuter signed the order preventing him from owning or purchasing guns. A headline on the Free Thought Project said, ""Florida police now confiscating guns from people with no due process."" The headline and the story make it appear that Florida police arbitrarily took away a man’s guns, and that’s not the case. The man in question voluntarily gave his weapons to police before he was taken into custody under the Baker Act, a judge said. While the man was being treated, Lighthouse Point police followed the protocol for obtaining a temporary risk protection order, and the man did not contest the order at any point during the court proceedings. With everything considered, we rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2018/apr/04/free-thought-project/did-florida-police-seize-mans-gun-out-due-process-/

Austin region gains hundreds of residents daily, but loses residents too
","An activist questioning plans to include a U.S. citizenship question in the 2020 Census warned that if fewer Texans fill out the decennial survey, the state could be shorted government aid and full representation, both tied to population counts. ""Additionally, I want to just emphasize the growth of Texas,"" Jose Carrillo of the NALEO Educational Fund said at a March 28, 2018, Texas Capitol press conference. The fund is part of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. ""Just in the Austin MSA alone,"" Carrillo said, ""150 people move here every day. So those folks need resources, and government needs to provide those resources."" MSA means metropolitan statistical area. It’s been a spell since we’ve fact-checked how many people flock to the state's capital and stick around. But in 2014, we found Mostly False a claim that 110 people a day were moving to Austin alone. That figure was in the ballpark for the number of people moving to the five-county region, as Ryan Robinson, the city demographer, reaffirmed in a 2018 statement he emailed to our renewed inquiry. We concluded before, though, that Austin alone was netting perhaps 40 to 60 additional residents a day. Carrillo cites net growth So, what’s the latest in population changes in the region encompassing Travis, Williamson, Hays, Caldwell and Bastrop counties? By phone, Carrillo told us he got his tally from the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce. The chamber’s Beverly Kerr subsequently told us she drew on the latest annual U.S. Census Bureau estimate that as of July 2017, the Austin-Round Rock MSA’s population totaled 2,115,827, up 55,269 from 2,060,558 the year before. That breaks out to regional growth of 151 people a day over the 12 months taking into account both people coming from other places and local births continuing to outpace deaths, Kerr and Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, each advised by email. In the MSA, the bureau says, births over the 12 months outpaced deaths by 16,791, with the difference accounting for 46 of the region’s 151 new residents a day. Put another way, net migration into the region occurred at a rate of 105 residents a day. In reality, Kerr wrote, ""a good deal more than 105 people or 150 people move to Austin each day, but a lot of people move out, too."" Fewer people leave We asked both experts to speak solely to Carrillo's focus on people moving into the region. Kerr noted that the bureau’s 2016 American Community Survey estimated that 129,119 of 2,030,464 Austin-Round Rock region residents over 1 year old had moved to the area in the same year from a different region or from abroad--which breaks out to a (gulp-inducing) 354 incoming residents a day. Potter noted separately that per five-year ACS estimates, 211 people a day moved out of the Austin region to another U.S. locale; the survey doesn’t tally people who’ve left for another country. All told, Potter said by email, the five-year ACS results suggest the region was netting 138 people a day in the period, counting more than 350 new residents a day. It's worth stressing that the approximately 350 new residents a day estimate is one-sided in that it doesn’t take into account people leaving the region. Potter counseled too that the ACS count was based on annualizing responses to surveys and then statistical weighting of responses, meaning there’s sampling error at work, he said. ""In sum,"" Potter wrote, ""I think it is most accurate to say there were, on average, 151 additional residents per day between July 1, 2016 and July 1, 2017 and that on average, 105 of the additional residents are the result of net-migration."" Our ruling Carrillo said: ""Just in the Austin MSA alone, 150 people move here every day."" The five-county region’s population grew by 151 people a day in the 12 months up to July 2017, according to the latest annual federal estimate. This growth was mostly due to people moving in outpacing people leaving the region with a third of the net growth tied to local births outpacing deaths. But specific to what Carrillo said, Census Bureau work rooted in surveys taken in the five years through 2015 suggests that about 350 people a day were moving into the region. It's worth stressing, though, that this figure doesn't account for people who (inexplicably) skedaddled. We rate Carrillo’s statement, accurately recapping the region's latest growth, Mostly True.

Mike DeWine TV ad says GOP opponent Mary Taylor's work schedule is 'almost untraceable'
","Ohio Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor is a slacker who isn’t ready for a promotion to the governor’s mansion, says her Republican primary opponent, Attorney General Mike DeWine. On the website marydoesnotwork.com, the DeWine campaign posted a statewide TV ad that makes a series of attacks about her work record, including that she was a no-show. Part of the ad states: ""Taylor is dogged by rumors that she skips out on work. A slacker whose work schedule is almost untraceable."" We found that the ad cherrypicks a couple of sentences from one newspaper article about Taylor’s work schedule while ignoring her explanation. Also, the attack pertains to her former job as state auditor (2007-11) and not her current job as lieutenant governor. DeWine and Taylor are competing in the May 8 Republican primary. The ad draws on a March 2010 article by the Cleveland Plain Dealer, which reported that since Taylor took office as state auditor in 2007, she had been dogged by rumors about skipping work. The state auditor, an elected position, is responsible for auditing all public offices in Ohio including cities, schools, state universities and state agencies. ""The fact that she admittedly spends as much time working away from her main Columbus office as she is there has only fueled speculation that Ohioans had elected a slacker,"" the Plain Dealer wrote. ""She doesn't document her work hours. She doesn't ask for mileage reimbursement from the state. And she can't tell you how much time she spends working here or there. Her work schedule is almost untraceable, and that's how Taylor seems to like it."" The ad omits Taylor’s explanation to the Plain Dealer: Taylor said that she preferred to use one of her seven regional offices, including one close to her home in Canton, rather than travel to Columbus. The Columbus Dispatch wrote in February 2010 that Taylor was ""the first statewide executive officeholder in memory to work most of the week from an office outside the state capital."" Taylor worked several days a week out of the Canton office, allowing her to work close to home where she was raising two teenage boys with her husband, the Dispatch reported. She said she worked in Columbus one or two days a week. ""I'm elected state auditor, I'm not just the auditor of Columbus,"" Taylor told the Dispatch. ""From my perspective, it is manageable, and I think it's more efficient at times."" The Dispatch’s editorial board concluded that critics of Taylor were ignoring both the prevalence of telecommuting and the nature of the state auditor's work. The editorial board wrote that 653 of Taylor's 833 employees worked in regional offices away from Columbus. ""As long as the auditor's office is effectively managed, Taylor's location isn't of primary importance,"" the board wrote. We asked her campaign spokesman to cite some of her key accomplishments as auditor. Michael Duchesne said her office did ""rigorous financial audits of more than 5,600 public entities"" and identified millions of dollars in public funds that were handled improperly, spent illegally or stolen, leading to convictions. The auditor’s office also uncovered Medicaid fraud and tracked federal stimulus dollars. The ad said that Taylor’s work schedule was ""almost untraceable,"" so we went in search of any record of her calendar while auditor and could not find one. The Ohio State Auditor’s office said her executive correspondence was transferred to the state archives. A reference archivist told us that a catalog record showed boxes of correspondence, but didn’t show her schedule. Taylor became the lieutenant governor in January 2011 and was re-elected along with Gov. John Kasich in 2014. Kasich is term limited. In 2015, Taylor told the Plain Dealer that she ""usually"" worked in Columbus. ""It’s no secret, and I make no apologies for this,"" she replied when asked about the time she spends close to home. ""My family comes first. And you know what? I tell my staff the same thing."" We asked her spokesman in the lieutenant governor’s office for a sample of her calendar. David Hopcraft sent PolitiFact her schedule between July and December 2016. The calendar showed the dates and times of policy briefings, staff meetings, public events, media interviews, phone calls and travel time. Hopcraft told PolitiFact that in 2018 she has taken personal time to campaign, but she has also come into the official office about once every 10 days to two weeks. We asked Hopcraft for a list of her accomplishments while lieutenant governor. Taylor was also the director of the Ohio Department of Insurance for most of her tenure, which meant she guided state policy related to health insurance coverage and other types of insurance, he said. She has also worked to cut business regulations and recruit business to Ohio and was the signatory on an agreement with Michigan and Indiana to reduce the load of  nutrients and phosphorus runoff into Lake Erie by 40 percent by 2025. Neverthless, news reports during Taylor’s tenure as lieutenant governor have raised questions about her oversight of workers. In 2014, Taylor’s then-chief of staff Laura Johnson and her administrative aide, Heather Brandt, both quit after a public records request revealed they were working less than they had reported. They had hundreds of questionable hours claimed for work, including for hair and salon appointments, an Inspector General report showed. The Inspector General concluded that employees ""operated with inadequate oversight, absence of supervision."" The Columbus Dispatch also found that Johnson worked on state time on the 2014 re-election campaign of Taylor and John Kasich. A TV ad by DeWine said that Taylor has a work schedule that ""is almost untraceable."" This attack refers to Taylor’s time as auditor, which ended when she became lieutenant governor in 2011. We were unable to find detailed records of her work schedule as auditor. By stating that her work schedule was ""almost untraceable,"" the ad creates the impression that she was hardly ever at work, but the ad and the 2010 Plain Dealer article it draws from don’t prove that occurred. The ad omits Taylor’s explanation: that she worked out of a regional office close to her home. The ad also omits any information about where Taylor has worked in her current role. We were able to find her calendar while lieutenant governor by requesting it from her office.

Is GOP congresswoman McSally a border hawk flip-flopper, as Kelli Ward claimed?
","U.S. Senate hopeful Kelli Ward called out her Republican opponent as a flip-flopper on a crucial matter to Arizona: border security. ""Hey Martha McSally, we could discuss your record a lot easier if you agreed to publicly debate the issues. But since you refuse to, will you at least agree to be honest with the voters? #FlipFlopBorderHawk #TimeToDebate #NoMoreFlakes #AZSEN,"" Ward said in a March 16 Facebook post. The Senate seat is up for grabs as Republican Sen. Jeff Flake’s term comes to an end. Flake isn’t running for re-election. The Republican primary is Aug. 28. Ward, a Republican physician who has served in the state Senate, linked her comment against McSally to a post on Newsmax headlined, ""Republicans side with Dems against border wall funding."" It cited a joint statement from McSally, a U.S. House member since 2015, and Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, acknowledging both the need for border security and for stewardship of taxpayer dollars. Has McSally flip-flopped on her support for the border wall? Ward's campaign pointed to McSally's past reservations on the effectiveness of a 2,000-mile border wall, as well as her initial hesitation to approve money for border barriers requested by President Donald Trump. Yet McSally — who chairs a House subcommittee responsible for oversight of border security programs — ultimately voted to appropriate the funds.  Overall, McSally has been neither a fierce critic nor a staunch supporter of the border wall.  Ward’s team turned the spotlight on a March 15 tweet from McSally that said, ""I have always supported building a wall,"" linking to a Fox News interview in which she decried California’s immigration policies as too lenient.  I have always supported building a wall, but with @JerryBrownGov ’s liberal attitude on sanctuary cities, we might have to build a wall between Arizona and California to protect Arizonans pic.twitter.com/BAu9L96PaF But McSally wasn’t always such a fan, Ward's campaign said, pointing to comments about her and that she made in 2017. The Hill in January 2017 reported that Hurd, from Texas, ""actively opposes the wall,"" while McSally and Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., ""expressed skepticism"" about its effectiveness in stopping illegal immigration. CNN reported on a rowdy town hall in her district the next month and said McSally ""made it clear she wasn't sold on Trump's plan to build a border wall."" ""Not a continuous, 2,000-mile border wall, no,"" CNN quoted McSally as saying. The Wall Street Journal in April 2017 reported that McSally said walls do little to stop criminal organizations from getting across the border. It cited the McSally-Hurd oversight letter with questions about the request for taxpayer money. (McSally and Hurd are chair and vice-chair, respectively, of the House Committee on Homeland Security’s Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee.) ""While we have both publicly stated in the past that we believe physical barriers to be one of many tools required to gain operational control of the border, we also believe that an expenditure this large, and submitted with limited details, deserves additional scrutiny to ensure funds are being used effectively in pursuit of our shared goal of securing the southwest border,"" their letter said. It listed several questions, including whether the department would consider existing manmade and natural barriers when constructing new barriers. After Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 calling for the border wall and the hiring of an additional 5,000 Border Patrol agents, McSally said it was a ""strong start in the right direction."" ""When it comes to barriers, they are important where appropriate, but only part of the equation. What we need is a comprehensive strategy to grow situational awareness, build operational control, and dismantle the cartels and their networks,"" she said. In July 2017, McSally voted in favor of a spending bill that included money for border fencing and wall construction planning. But as AZCentral.com noted, McSally praised the bill for what it did for defense, veterans and water, but stopped short of mentioning the border wall. McSally campaign spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair told PolitiFact that McSally is ""unequivocally in favor of building a wall,"" with the addition of technology and agents. McSally has also sponsored and supported several bills to increase border security since joining Congress in 2015, her campaign said. In a November 2017 Fox News interview, McSally said a necessary border strategy is one that ""absolutely includes the border wall and physical infrastructure where appropriate."" McSally's remarks and actions in 2017 show that while she hasn't been an effusive supporter of the wall, she favors it to an extent. It's worth mentioning that McSally represents a district that voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Does that mean McSally has flip-flopped on border wall funding? Josiah M. Heyman, an anthropology professor and director of the Center for Interamerican and Border Studies at the University of Texas at El Paso, said he understood Ward’s point given McSally’s 2017 reticence. He noted that an appropriations bill she voted for was for ""a very limited version of the wall,"" and much of it restricted to reworking segments that already exist. The funds also can’t be used to build any of the new wall prototypes, Heyman said. Elizabeth F. Cohen, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University, said ""it is disingenuous to claim that someone who has acted cautiously or recommended scrutiny of border wall plans is either for or against building the wall."" ""McSally has voted in favor of funding border fencing and wall construction,"" Cohen said. ""Cautious support may in fact ultimately be quite important to the realization of effective border security given that there are many types of border fences and walls that are ineffective or dangerous."" Ward in a Facebook post called McSally a #FlipFlopBorderHawk. In 2017, McSally publicly questioned a funding request for border barriers — due to limited details — but ultimately voted in favor of it. McSally has said a border wall alone will not stop illegal immigration or criminal organizations, but can work in certain areas. In 2018, McSally has offered a strong embrace, saying she has ""always supported building a wall."" Ward’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

Waco activist says Texas Constitution ""still contains Jim Crow provisions about the poll tax and restrictions on women having the right to vote""
","
An oped article published in the Austin American-Statesman March 11 says the much-amended Texas Constitution, adopted in 1876, is ripe for a modernizing overhaul.

Charles Reed of Waco writes: ""In the 135 years since its ratification, the constitution of 1876 has been amended 467 times in a haphazard fashion. The result is a constitution that is chaotic, incoherent, lengthy, unwieldy and full of dead wood."" An effort joined by Reed to draft an overhaul is touted at http://reorgcon2011.com/.

Among the rotten timbers still in the constitution, the article says:  ""Jim Crow provisions about the poll tax and restrictions on women having the right to vote.""

That tax and male-only voting are long-gone practices. So this claim piqued our curiousity.

Reed, a retired federal employee who was once Waco’s mayor, initially told us that what while such language remains in the infamously unwieldy constitution, ""it’s, of course, not operable language.""

He referred us to Article VI, titled ""Suffrage."" When we looked at the latest version of the constitution posted online by the Texas Legislative Council, we found that the article opens with language that bars from voting people who are under 18 or who have been found mentally incompetent by a court or convicted of a felony. The article makes no specific references to the poll tax or to women voting.

Realizing the tax was prevalent for decades and that U.S. women were not permitted to vote until the 20th century, we turned next to the Handbook of Texas, published by the Texas State Historical Society.

Its entry titled ""Woman Suffrage"" says Texas women gained the right to vote in party primaries in 1918 through a measure approved by legislators and signed into law by Gov. William Hobby. Some 386,000 women women registered to vote in that year’s Democratic primary, the entry says.

But attempts to give women the vote in all elections were thwarted, the entry says, even after lawmakers in 1919 heeded Hobby’s counsel to send voters a proposed constitutional amendment extending full suffrage to women. Hobby also sought a proposed amendment to take the vote from persons of foreign birth who hadn’t also attained U.S. citizenship through naturalization--and when the two proposed changes were rolled into a single amendment, it lost at the polls.

A month later, according to the entry, the proposal to amend the U.S. Constitution to permit women to vote was submitted to the states. Texas legislators ratified what soon became the federal document’s 19th Amendment, stating that the right to vote shall not be abridged or denied by any state on account of sex.

What about the poll tax, the fee that had to be paid at the polls and helped deter low-income and minority citizens from voting for a long time? The handbook’s entry on the state’s election laws says the 1964 elections were the first ""in which no poll tax was required to vote in federal elections"" due to the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The amendment abolished the poll tax as a voting requirement for president, vice president, presidential electors, U.S. senators and representatives.

In Texas, though, the tax survived for state and local elections until voters in 1966 approved an amendment removing it from the constitution.

Reed suggested we check his statement with David Guinn, a Baylor University law professor. Guinn nudged us to Austin lawyer Bob Heath, who once helped the Texas attorney general draft advisory opinions about legal issues. In an interview, Heath said he doesn’t think Reed’s statement is correct. Like us, he did not find references to women not voting and the poll tax in the current constitution.

In a follow-up conversation, Reed said, ""I recognize I was wrong in saying that. I was going based on my memory"" in the op-ed article.  However, he said his main point holds: The constitution has a lot of ""inoperable language"" that needs to be pruned, such as outdated references to bonds for special districts that have been paid off. ""I made a mistake in using the wrong example,"" Reed said.

We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2011/mar/19/charles-reed/waco-activist-says-texas-constitution-still-contai/

Anne Hathaway and other celebs sign letter urging President Obama to join the 'majority of Americans' in support of gay marriage
","
Actor Anne Hathaway and other Hollywood celebrities recently wrote to President Barack Obama urging him to support gay marriage. The letter said a majority of Americans now support it.

Indeed, public opinion on gay marriage is shifting quickly. How quickly? Let's just say we're glad we waited a day to publish our item.

The letter came on the heels of the White House announcement that it would no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court. The act defines marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman. The letter, sponsored by Freedom to Marry, a group that advocates for marriage for same-sex couples, called the DOMA decision ""a powerful statement about the law"" and an ""important step toward equal protection under the law for all Americans.""

The letter urged the president ""to complete your journey and join us, and the majority of Americans, who support the freedom to marry.""

It was signed by a group of actors, musicians, business executives and pro athletes including entertainers Ellen DeGeneres and Martin Sheen; musicians Rufus Wainwright and Melissa Etheridge; and football players Scott Fujita and Brendon Ayanbadejo.

Obama's position to date has been support for ""strong civil unions,"" but he allowed in December that, ""my feelings are constantly evolving,"" and that he will ""continue to wrestle"" with the issue.

The American public has long been deeply divided over the question of same-sex marriage, and so we wondered if the letter is accurate that a majority of Americans now support it.

Jackie Yodashkin, a spokeswoman for Freedom to Marry, backed up the claim by pointing us toward two polls.

The first was a poll conducted by the Associated Press in August 2010 that asked the question, ""Should the Federal Government give legal recognition to marriages between couples of the same sex, or not?""  It was supported by 52 percent and opposed by 46 percent. The percentages were nearly the reverse in a poll the year before.

The second was a CNN poll, also in August 2010, in which 52 percent responded ""yes"" to the question, ""Do you think gays and lesbians should have a constitutional right to get married and have their marriage recognized by law as valid?"" But the results differed slightly depending how the question was asked. Half got a question that read ""should have"" right to marry and the other half was asked if gay people ""have"" a right to marry. The ""should"" version produced a 52-46 majority in favor of gay marriage, while the ""have a right"" question produced a 49-51 majority against.

Charles Franklin, co-founder of Pollster.com and professor of political science at University of Wisconsin at Madison, said the results show people understand ""it isn't a settled constitutional right, though a majority think it should be one.""

Other polls show growing support for gay marriage, but less than a majority.

For example, a Pew Research Center poll released on March 3, 2011, found that while the clear trend is heading in favor of gay marriage, the American public remains about equally divided.

According to a Pew news release on its study, ""The new poll finds that about as many adults now favor (45 percent) as oppose (46 percent) allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally. Last year opponents outnumbered supporters 48 percent to 42 percent. Opposition to same-sex marriage has declined by 19 percentage points since 1996, when 65 percent opposed gay marriage and only 27 percent were in favor.""

A review of the totality of recent polls suggests that, ""opinion has moved, but it is not a majority sentiment yet,"" said Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

""I'd rate it 'not true yet,'"" Franklin said. ""There are some individual polls that have shown support larger than opposition but the overall trend isn't quite there yet.""

But it's likely to be true soon, he said.

""The consistency of the trends since 2005 all but guarantee support will exceed opposition within the year,"" said Franklin, who wrote about the trend in a recent Huffington Post story.

Then, on March 18, 2011, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that a slim majority now supports gay marriage.

According to the Post story about it, ""The results underscore the nation’s increasingly tolerant views about homosexuals, and parallel a string of recent legal and legislative victories for gay rights advocates.""

""Five years ago, at 36 percent, support for gay marriage barely topped a third of all Americans,"" the story states. ""Now, 53 percent say gay marriage should be legal, marking the first time in Post-ABC polling that a majority has said so.""

The story notes that opponents of same-sex marriage took issue with the wording in the poll: ""Do you think it should be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian couples to get married?""

According to the story, ""Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, argued that the term 'illegal' could be inferred to mean that violators could be imprisoned, which most Americans would consider harsh."" It is the same language used in Post-ABC News polls since 2003.

""The only poll that counts is a free and fair vote on the part of the people,"" Brown told the Washington Post. ""We’ve seen these biased polls time and time again -- right before votes in which same-sex marriage is rejected. It’s absurd. The people of this country have not changed their opinion about marriage.""

A couple of other caveats.

When the option of civil unions (short of marriage) is added to the mix, the numbers change. In several recent polls that asked which of three options best describes their preference -- legalizing same-sex marriage, civil unions or none -- the top-rated option was legalizing marriage, with about 37 to 40 percent support.

""I would not rate that as evidence of majority support for gay marriage, though it is an interesting change from the early 2000s when no legal recognition was the largest category,"" Franklin said.

One other factor to consider: Public opinion sometimes shifts when the issue of gay marriage really heats up.

""We saw movement away from gay marriage in 2004-05, showing that despite the long-term trend there is a possibility of reaction against expansion of gay marriage when the issue is made especially salient,"" Franklin said.  ""But that said, it is hard to imagine the lines don't cross in the next 12 months or so, given how much the gap closed in each of the last five years.""

Bottom line, most of the polls taken in 2010 and 2011 show that while there is a clear trend in recent years toward support for gay marriage, but it is not quite yet a majority. But there are some polls that have found the tipping point has been reached, and that a slim majority now support gay marriage. And that includes the newest poll, from the Washington Post-ABC News. And so we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/18/anne-hathaway/anne-hathaway-and-other-celebs-sign/

Bob Goodlatte says House budget offers largest discetionary spending cut in history
","
The U.S government got a three-week lease on life Thursday as Congress passed yet another stopgap that will fund federal operations through April 8.

But the threat of a shutdown still lurks as Republicans and Democrats remain deadlocked on the magnitude of spending cuts for the 2011 federal budget, which runs through Sept.30.

U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Roanoke, supported deep budget cuts approved by the GOP-led House on Feb 19. In a column posted on his website six days later, Goodlatte said the bill cuts $100 billion.

""This represents the largest discretionary spending cut in history,"" Goodlatte said.

Kathryn Rexrode, a spokeswoman for Goodlatte, said her boss’ statement has been widely uttered by interest groups and members of Congress, including Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.

We wondered if the cuts would be truly historic.

First, an important detail: The $100 billion figure that Goodlatte and other Republicans are using represents the amount the House would ax from President Barack Obama’s 2011 budget proposal. Budget analysts from conservative and liberal organizations told us it is more meaningful to say the House proposal would cut spending by $61 billion, which is the amount it would excise from the 2010 federal budget.

The Senate, by contrast, wants to pare $10.5 billion from last year’s budget.

So our goal is to see whether U.S. discretionary spending was ever reduced by more than $61 billion from one budget to the next.

Discretionary spending is the money the federal government pays out through a dozen or so appropriation bills Congress approves each year. It adds up to about 40 percent of the national budget  and includes a variety of services such as defense, law enforcement, transportation and national parks.

If you’re curious, non-discretionary spending largely refers to three benefit programs Congress is required to fund at certain levels: social security, Medicare and Medicaid.

We didn’t go back to the 1st Congress in 1789 to determine whether the proposed spending cut is indeed historic. The annual federal budget did not exceed $61 billion -- the amount the House wants to cut this year -- until 1943.

We analyzed spreadsheets from the Office of Management and Budget. To roughly compute discretionary spending each year since 1943, we took the total budget outlay and subtracted the costs of Social Security and interest payments on government loans. The nation began paying for Medicare and Medicaid in the 1966 budget so starting that year, we also subtracted the cost of those programs.

The largest reductions came after World War II as the U.S. was returning to peace. Discretionary spending dropped by about $38.5 billion in 1946 about $21 billion in 1947 -- entirely because of defense cuts.

There have been a few other years when discretionary funding has dipped by smaller amounts: in the mid 1950s after the Korean War and in 1965. The feat was last accomplished in 1996, when discretionary spending dropped $12.1 billion. 
All of those numbers are smaller than the $61 billion the House wants to cut this year, so Godlatte’s claim is technically correct. But the post-World War II cuts, when adjusted for their times and inflation, were far greater in magnitude than anything being considered today.

The 1946 cuts represented a 43 percent reduction in discretionary spending and 1947 brought another 41 percent cut. In contrast, this year’s House plan proposes a 4.5 percent drop.

When adjusted for inflation, the 1946 cuts equal about $438 billion worth of reductions in today’s dollars -- more than seven times the reductions in the House budget. The 1947 cuts come to about $207 billion in today’s dollars.

One final point: While the post World War II reductions came from military spending, this year’s House proposal would shield defense from cuts.

Let’s review:

Goodlatte says the proposed House budget would be ""the largest discretionary spending cut in history."" The plan would pare $61 billion from last year’s discretionary budget.

In terms of raw numbers, Goodlatte is correct. The closest Congress came to that number was about a $38.5 reduction in 1946 and about a $21 billion lop the following year. But the magnitude of those post-war cuts, when adjusted for inflation and the percentage of non-discretionary spending they represented at the time, far outstrips this year’s House proposal.

Goodlatte’s statement is accurate but benefits from clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/18/bob-goodlatte/bob-goodlatte-says-house-budget-offers-largest-dis/

Business group says Florida is one of three states that regulates commercial interior designers
","
Abhorred by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Republican legislators and even President Barack Obama, regulations have been a popular target of lawmakers this year. Prosperity in the private sector, they say, will come when government removes rules that stifle competition and growth.

On Jan. 25, 2011, the House Business and Consumer Affairs Subcommittee heard regulation-related complaints from several pro-business representatives, including Allen Douglas, legislative affairs director for the National Federation of Independent Business’ Florida branch. The NFIB is a national association of advocates for small businesses.

Douglas focused his complaints on state licenses, particularly those for interior designers. The state issues licenses for many professions, but the interior design license is a hot debate. Proponents say it takes a certified design professional to ensure a commercial space is fit for human needs. Opponents, like the NFIB, argue it should not take several years of experience, education and exams to do the job, and Florida’s law is too severe.

""Florida is one of only three states that require licenses for commercial interior designers,"" Douglas told the committee. ""The argument will be it’s a public safety and health issue. … If you’re in an office building with a lot of cubicles, the aisle ways need to be a certain width, you know, you can’t block the fire exits. Well, there’s other people in place -- fire marshals, other types of inspectors -- that will take care of that.

""It keeps people out of the industry, because it’s very hard to become a commercial interior designer in this state.""

Back up: Florida is one of just three states that requires a license for commercial interior designers? That’s an exclusive club, if true. We had to give this claim a second look.

We started by checking the Florida Statutes, to see whether Florida regulates its commercial interior designers in the first place. The answer is yes.

Florida has a ""practice act"" that mandates commercial interior designers have licenses. To attain one in Florida, an aspiring designer must achieve six years of education and experience and pass all three portions of the National Council for Interior Design Qualification exam. There is a $125 biennial renewal fee, and continuing education is also required.

A practice act is more stringent than title or registration acts in other states, which regulate the profession in name only. Many states have title or registration acts that allow applicants to market themselves as ""certified"" or ""registered"" interior designers as long as they meet varied exam, education and experience requirements and fees. Earning state approval is a way to give consumers a certain amount of confidence in whom they hire.

Next we touched base with Douglas. He says he got involved with Florida’s interior design law in 2009, when the NFIB and the Institute for Justice, a national libertarian law firm, filed a federal lawsuit against the state Board of Architecture and Interior Design challenging Florida’s practice act.

The Institute for Justice put up a YouTube video and statement about Florida’s interior design law two years ago, calling the state ""ground zero in the nationwide battle to ‘cartel-ize’ the interior design industry."" The institute claimed interior design regulations have several consequences, including higher fees and fewer employment opportunities, ""especially for minorities and older mid-career switchers.""

On Feb. 4, 2010, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Hinkle of the Northern District of Florida ruled in the NFIB’s favor on one part of the lawsuit: A rule that limited the use of ""interior designer"" to only those with licenses was unconstitutional. This decision allows unlicensed residential decorators the option to market themselves as ""interior designers.""

However, Hinkle upheld Florida’s practice act, which governs non-residential designers, as constitutional. The NFIB and Institute for Justice appealed their lawsuit to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Alabama. On March 1, 2011, the appeals court rejected their case in a 24-page document, saying in part it would not ""second-guess the legislature’s judgment as to the relative safety justifications versus any burdens imposed on interstate commerce."" The appeals court affirmed the district court’s ruling, so Florida’s interior design law remains in effect. 

So, to recap: Interior designers in Florida need a license for jobs that involve commercial spaces, draperies, flooring, clubhouses and swimming pool areas. The license enables them to submit stamped and signed drawing plans and carry out work on design projects. But no one needs a license to offer residential interior design, or services including window treatments and paint.

The Department of Business and Professional Regulation, which oversees the board, sums it up for consumers: ""If you are going to hire someone to design the interior of a commercial structure, he/she needs to be licensed.""

But what we wanted to check is whether three states is correct. Douglas pointed us to Patti Morrow, executive director of the Interior Designer Protection Council and a staunch advocate for fewer restrictions on the industry.

Morrow tracks interior design legislation for all states on her website. She is sometimes depicted boasting pink boxing gloves, symbolizing her fight against Florida’s ""anti-competitive, anti-consumer monopoly"" of interior design. She said by phone that four states used to require a license to practice interior design: Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and Nevada. But Alabama left the pack when the state Supreme Court ruled its practice act unconstitutional in 2007. So that leaves three.

Morrow, who lives in New Hampshire, appeared at an emotional committee meeting of the Florida House, which passed a bill that would roll back regulation of interior designers and 30 other professions, on March 15, 2011. She repeated at that meeting the claim about Florida being one of three states to regulate commercial interior design.

We then went to the website of the pro-licensing side, the Interior Design Associations Foundation, which also tracks state legislation, to corroborate the count. The American Society of Interior Designers offers a similar state-by-state view of requirements for interior designers. Check! These groups’ practice-act counts match up to Morrow’s count of three states.

Now, we should mention that while those three states are the only that require ""licenses,"" several states — including New York, Kentucky and Alabama -- have education, experience and exam requirements that do not result in a license but grant use of a title. In New York, for instance, a ""certified interior designer"" applicant must pay a $377 fee, be at least 21, have at least seven years of acceptable education and experience credits, pass the NCIDQ, and ""be of good moral character."" 
Douglas said that ""Florida is one of only three states that requires licenses for commercial interior designers. Both the pro- and anti-licensing camps agree that only Florida, Nevada and Louisiana require licenses to practice commercial interior design, and a court upheld the Florida law earlier this month. The state Legislature is trying to remove some of the restrictions on these licenses, but it has not happened yet. So we rate this statement True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/18/national-federation-independent-business-florida/business-group-says-florida-one-three-states-regul/

Milwaukee Police Association says it has offered several million dollars in savings in contract negotiations with the City of Milwaukee
","
After the Green Bay Packers won the Super Bowl in February 2011, news in Wisconsin centered on Gov. Scott Walker’s attempt to curtail the collective bargaining powers of most government workers and make those workers pay more for their benefits.

Only police and other public safety employees were exempted.

Yet on March 7 and 9, 2011, the Milwaukee Police Association ran a half-page ad in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel touting how the union had offered to make financial sacrifices worth millions of dollars.

The reference was to contract talks between the union -- which represents 1,700 officers, detectives and other police employees -- and the City of Milwaukee.

MPA offered $12 million ""in immediate savings through 2011"" and $184 million in savings ""over the next 25 years,"" the ad announced. The claims were recited the next day in a news release issued by Milwaukee Ald. Bob Donovan.

Let’s see if they’re true.

Contracts for Milwaukee police and firefighters expired in 2009. Both unions are in mediation with the city over contracts that would be retroactive to January 2010 and continue through December 2011.

Mayor Tom Barrett, who lost to Walker in the November 2010 gubernatorial election, asked the unions in March 2011 to agree to pay more for pensions and health insurance, as called for in Walker’s budget-repair bill.

MPA president Mike Crivello said at the time his union would consider the request -- and he reiterated the concessions that MPA had already offered.

That is, the $12 million in savings through 2011 and the $184 million over the next 25 years.

There are quite a few figures, but hang us with us; we’ll walk through the three main ways the union claims the money will be saved.

Pay freeze for 2010 and 2011

The ad says a two-year pay freeze would save the city $5.4 million per year.

But Crivello acknowledged the ad is in error on this point and that $5.4 million would be the total savings through 2011, the two-year period of the contract.

Where did the number come from?

MPA arrived at the figure by assuming -- based on raises in newly-signed police contracts around the country -- that an arbitrator would award 2.5 percent raises for 2010 and 2011 if the union and the city could not agree on a contract, according to MPA vice president Mark Buetow.

Let’s pause here for some perspective.

First, the union assumes raises would be virtually automatic. But there is no way to know what an arbitrator would decide.

Second, avoiding 2.5 percent pay raises through a pay freeze may be a figurative savings of $5.4 million for the city, but it’s not a literal savings. With a pay freeze, the city would still be spending as much on payroll as it does today.

Reduced wage for training

The ad says the city would save $1.04 million per year through a ""reduced wage for training."" That would be a total of $2.08 million through 2011.

Crivello said the union would accept a reduced starting wage for new officers for the nearly six months they spend in training before hitting the streets. The $2.08 million in savings is based on the city hiring 200 new recruits per year.

But that 200 is a big if.

Crivello said 200 new hires would give the department roughly the number of officers that have been authorized as part of the city budget. But he acknowledged that the city commonly keeps roughly that many police positions vacant.

Troy Hamblin, the city labor negotiator, said the city has hired an average of 79 police recruits per year since Barrett was elected mayor in 2004. Based on that number, he said the lower training wage would save the city $1.09 million through 2011 -- about half the union’s estimate.  

So, the union is banking on the city more than doubling its usual police hiring in order for the $2.08 million through 2011 to be saved. A more realistic number would be about half that.

Those aspects relate directly to the immediate savings. The next is the central part of the claim of saving $184 million over 25 years.

New hire pension contributions

The newspaper ad says that if new hires make contributions to their pensions -- current employees represented by MPA make none -- the city would save $184 million ""over the next 25 years.""

That’s an awful specific number, and 25 years is a long time away.

Where did the figure come from?

The union says the estimate -- based on today’s payroll -- is for what the annual savings would be 25 years from now. That is, the amount saved each year, once we are 25 years into the future.

Why 25 years in the future?

Since contracts allow police officers to retire after 25 years on the job, by that point nearly the entire force would be under the new provisions.

(The city’s estimate, using that measure is $179 million in savings a year, based on today’s payroll. So, the two sides are not far off.)

That may seem clear enough.

But the wording in the ad -- savings ""over the next 25 years"" -- is confusing.

We read it as the total amount saved during the course of those 25 years and think most others would as well. That figure is even harder to calculate, since it depends on how many officers retire or leave the force and at what point; how rapidly those officers are replaced and what happens to their salary in the meantime.

Indeed, by that measure, the overall savings is likely much higher. The annual savings would grow as the force shifts over time from most being under the current no-contribution system, to most being under the new approach.

Of course, the numbers in the short term on this point are stronger.

As for the immediate savings in the contract, Crivello said that if new hires paid 7 percent of their base wage toward their pensions, the city would save $432,000 through 2011 (the city’s estimate is $462,000, so there is not a big disagreement on this one either).

All right, let’s tally the estimated savings from the three areas to see if they back up the two major claims in the union ad. Those were the ones in large, bold print: $12 million through 2011 and $184 million ""over the next 25 years.""

$12 million through 2011: Savings from a pay freeze are figurative, based on forgoing an assumed pay raise. The city’s payroll costs would actually remain flat, so there would be no direct savings to the budget. The reduced training wage would save the city about $2.08 million and pension contributions would save $432,000 -- both according to union estimates.

That’s a total of $2.51 million (the city’s estimate is $1.55 million). And that’s a fraction of the $12 million claimed.

So, the first of the ad’s two claims is wrong.

$184 million ""over the next 25 years"": This claim focuses on the pension change. The city doesn’t quarrel much with the dollar estimate, which is an annual savings using today’s dollars. But it’s a figure that wouldn’t be reached until the entire workforce turns over, perhaps 25 years from now.

There would be savings in the interim years, tallying over the intervening 25 years even more than that amount -- but no one knows how much.

So, the second claim may actually be low, but it is also off -- potentially way off.

One final note.

An asterisk at the bottom of the ad says MPA offered the three concessions ""in exchange for non-monetary and monetary items."" In other words, it’s clear that the union would only make the three concessions if it gets something in return.

MPA estimates the monetary items -- including higher life insurance benefits and higher pay for certain officers -- would cost the city less than $1 million per year, Buetow said. The city has not produced a complete estimate, but Hamblin said the union estimate appears reasonable.

So, that would further reduce the savings claimed in the MPA ad.

Time for the Truth-O-Meter.

The Milwaukee Police Association said concessions it offered in contract talks with the City of Milwaukee would save taxpayers $12 million through 2011 and $184 million ""over the next 25 years."" A proposed pay freeze would affect current employees, but wouldn’t save the city any money, while changes in training pay and pensions would save money but affect only new hires.

The savings through 2011 would be, using union estimates, $2.51 million -- a far cry from $12 million.

On the second point, the MPA is correct there would be about $184 million in savings … in the 25th year. But the wording in the ad refers to the savings during that entire time frame. So this number is also off -- apparently by a lot. The MPA’s case would actually be stronger if they used a more accurate number, since during the previous 24 years the annual savings would ramp up until it reaches that projected $184 million in year in year 25.

Rick Perry says rainy day fund is ""our insurance policy against a major natural disaster""
","Gov. Rick Perry opened a March 14 ""tele-town hall"" hosted by Empower Texans, a conservative group, by mentioning the earthquake in Japan.

The devastation there, Perry segued, supports a cautionary note about using the state’s rainy day fund. ""One of the things that I remind people, in why it is so important to protect that (fund) is... it is our insurance policy against a major natural disaster"" such as a huge hurricane barreling up the Houston Ship Channel. ""And for Texas to be caught in a situation where (it) did not have a substantial buffer in that (fund), it could be catastrophic"" to the economy, he said.

The next day, Perry agreed that the Legislature could take $3.1 billion from the fund to help cover a deficit in the current state budget, which runs through August. But he said he would not support tapping it for the 2012-13 budget being drafted by lawmakers.

We fixed on whether the fund, in place since 1988, is the state’s insurance policy against a major natural disaster.

Helpfully, the January-February 2011 issue of Fiscal Notes, a publication of the state comptroller’s office, has an article on the fund’s history. It says that in 1988, voters adopted a constitutional amendment creating the fund, formally called the Economic Stabilization Fund. The 1986 oil slump, which drove down state tax revenues, was still fresh in Texans’ minds, according to the article.

In a recent interview with Austin’s KUT-FM, Billy Hamilton, a former deputy state comptroller, said the fund was formulated to ""protect ourselves from future economic shocks.""

The fund accumulates money from shares of oil and/or gas production taxes; it also receives half of any unencumbered state revenue--unspent dollars not reserved for a specific purpose--at the end of every two-year budget period. Sharp increases in natural gas prices have boosted the fund, which held nearly $8.2 billion at the start of the 2011 legislative session in January and is projected to be $9.4 billion at the end of August 2013.

Since 1990, the recap says, some $11 billion has been deposited into the fund, which has also earned $580 million in total interest. Some $3.5 billion has been spent from the fund over the years, including more than $3 billion during Perry’s tenure as governor.

A February report by the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which wants lawmakers to use the fund in the current budget crunch, quotes a May 1987 summary of the proposed constitutional amendment that was prepared the House Research Organization: ""Should the state ever face another fiscal crisis like the current one, there would be money put aside for the state to fall back on. If the Economic Stabilization Fund existed now, the Legislature might not be facing the difficult choice between falling short of maintaining current state services and raising taxes in difficult economic times. Money could be appropriated from the fund to support existing programs.""

According to the report, the ballot language by which voters approved the amendment in 1988 stated: ""The constitutional amendment establishing an economic stabilization fund in the state treasury to be used to offset unforeseen shortfalls in revenue.""

Under the amendment, lawmakers may appropriate money from the fund for several stipulated reasons, including anticipated dips in state revenue. But those stipulations seem to pale in light of a provision giving lawmakers sweeping authority, with a two-thirds’ votes of the members present in each body, to ""appropriate amounts from the economic stabilization fund at any time and for any purpose.""

Whoa--any purpose, any time!

Next, let’s look at how the state has spent its rainy day revenue.

Comptroller spokesman R.J. DeSilva provided a detailed breakdown showing that over the years, rainy-day funds were appropriated to public education, health and human services, child protective services, the teacher retirement system and prisons, among beneficiaries. In 2003, lawmakers diverted $295 million in rainy-day dollars to launch an enterprise fund overseen by Perry to lure businesses to the state. Two years later, more money was taken from the fund to start an emerging technology fund overseen by the governor.

The breakdown shows one disaster-related tap; the 2003 Legislature allocated $6.4 million to reimburse the Department of Human Services for ""previously expended disaster assistance payments.""

So, nearly all fund expenditures have gone to purposes other than natural disasters.

Our take: Perry’s claim might reflect his opinion that the fund should be saved -- literally -- for stormy days. Still, it’s factually misleading. The purpose of the savings account was to buffer the state against economic shocks. To date, a small portion of the money has been spent in connection with a natural disaster. That leaves Perry’s statement Barely True.

Rep. Betty Sutton says Lake Erie drives jobs, tax revenues for Ohio
","
Cuts in government spending aim to reduce the deficit and bring the budget closer to balance. But the process can be more complicated than that.

That point was made when U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar went before the House Committee on Natural Resources this month to testify about President Obama's proposed fiscal 2012 budget request.

Rep. Betty Sutton noted the economic benefits the department helps spur in Ohio, as she focused on the budget recommendation to cut $125 million from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Sutton called the initiative ""incredibly important"" to the region economically.

""Lake Erie supports nearly 10 percent of Ohio's jobs and generates $750 million in state and local taxes,"" she said.

PolitiFact Ohio wondered where those figures came from, and took a look.

The long-range Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, developed by a task force of 11 federal agencies, aims to clean up toxic sediment and polluted areas, combating invasive species such as Asian carp, restore degraded wetlands and support fish and wildlife resources.

Obama requested $350 million for the program for fiscal 2012, down from the $475 million standard of 2010. The initiative was chopped to $225 million, or less than half of that, by a plan from House Republicans to cut $61 billion in federal spending.

We asked Sutton's office to cite her source for data on the Lake Erie’s economic impact. They referred us to the Great Lakes Commission, a cooperative formed by the eight Great Lakes states and Canada in 1955. One of the commission's fact sheets did have those numbers, and others, which were attributed to the commission's own studies and a variety of official sources.

The tax figure, credited by the commission to a fact sheet from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, ultimately came from Ohio Travel & Tourism, part of the Department of Development. It said that Lake Erie tourism generated $430 million in state tax revenue and $320 million in local tax revenue -- together totaling the $750 million Sutton cited.

But the commission's communications director, Christine Manninen, told us the jobs figure Sutton relied on was stated erroneously in the March 2011 fact sheet, in a paragraph that jumbled lake-related and statewide figures. The online fact sheet was corrected after the hearing where Sutton cited it.

It is the state's tourism industry that accounts for nearly 10 percent of Ohio's more than 5 million jobs, according to Ohio Travel & Tourism. Nevertheless, Lake Erie does support a large number of jobs -- more than 100,000 in northeast Ohio. 
Sutton relied on a credible official source for her numbers, and she cited them accurately, though one of her sources, a credible one at that, misstated its data.

That’s a piece of information needed for clarification. We rate her statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/18/betty-sutton/rep-betty-sutton-says-lake-erie-drives-jobs-tax-re/

Lawmakers claim on Sunday alcohol sales proves flawed

Some Georgia senators opposed to a controversial bill aimed at relaxing alcohol sales laws on Sundays made an interesting case Wednesday.

They argued there will be more drunken driving in Georgia on Sundays.

""You’re going to have... more deaths, more injuries if we pass this bill,"" said Sen. Bill Cowsert, a Republican from Athens.

Georgians can drink alcohol at bars and restaurants on Sundays, but they can’t buy it at retail stores. A bill that sets the stage to allow retail stores to sell beer, liquor and wine on Sundays was passed by the Senate on Wednesday by a 32-22 margin. The bill still must be passed by the House, and Gov. Nathan Deal has indicated he would sign legislation allowing local communities to vote on whether to allow stores to sell beer, liquor and wine on Sundays.

Our question isn’t whether the bill will pass. We wondered whether these senators are correct about the potential traffic impact of Sunday liquor sales.

Drexel University associate professor Mark Stehr has done several studies on the impact of easing so-called ""blue laws."" In June, he released a study called ""The Effect of Sunday Sales of Alcohol on Highway Crash Fatalities.""

That study focused on 13 states that either eased or repealed Sunday liquor laws between 1995 and 2005, using data from the federal government’s Fatality Analysis Reporting System. Those states were Delaware, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington.

Stehr said other past studies have reached mixed conclusions, but said many of them were outdated, focused solely on one state and failed to consider other traffic factors. Stehr’s study noted that alcohol-related crashes increased in New South Wales and Victoria, Australia, when alcohol sales laws were eased. But those changes came in 1979 and 1984, respectively, before the now-familiar campaigns advising motorists not to drink and drive.

Stehr used alcohol-related fatalities in nearly every state between 1990 and 2008. He recorded an alcohol-related fatality if either a police officer reported that alcohol was involved in the accident or if a blood alcohol test recorded any alcohol in the driver’s blood.

His conclusion? Stehr found no clear evidence of an increase in traffic fatalities in states that repealed Sunday bans on alcohol. His research found no statistically significant increase in beer sales in those states, but a 2.9 percent increase in the sales of liquor. PolitiFact Georgia covered some of this ground in a Feb. 22 fact-checkon the potential economic impact of changing liquor laws in Georgia.

""I think it’s unlikely that Georgia would experience much of an uptick,"" Stehr told us.

Stehr found New Mexico was the only state that saw an increase (21 percent) in fatalities after changing its Sunday alcohol laws.

As governor of Georgia, Sonny Perdue used New Mexico as a basis for his opposition to changing Georgia’s blue laws in a 2008 op-ed. He cited a study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (not conducted by Stehr) that found a 29 percent increase in Sunday crashes and a 42 percent rise in traffic fatalities after New Mexico changed its laws.

University of Georgia economics lecturer Jason Rudbeck co-wrote a study that found (with the help of a group that supports changing Georgia’s laws) ""no effect"" in alcohol-related crashes and fatalities once New Mexico changed its blue laws. He observed New Mexico also raised its speed limit on some roads to 75 mph around the same time the Sunday sales laws were changed, a factor also noted by Stehr.

Rudbeck said, and Stehr agrees, that many people who drink at bars and restaurants on Sundays wind up doing so at home when alcohol laws are charged, thus there is a lesser chance of alcohol-related wrecks.

Stehr noted that federal data shows New Mexico was second only to Montana in the ratio of alcohol-related to all fatal traffic crashes between 1990 and 2008. The professor believes New Mexico was unique from other states he studied because of the speed limit increase, longer driving distances and a higher rate of drunken driving than other states, as shown by the federal data.

In 2008, Colorado eased its Sunday alcohol sales laws. There, the number of drunken driving deaths on highways on Sundays declined, from 20 in 2009 to six in 2010, and fewer drunken-driving tickets were issued, state officials said.

Most research shows there’s little evidence that there will be a major spike in alcohol-related wrecks and fatalities on Georgia’s roads if it changed its Sunday alcohol laws. Colorado, in fact, has found fewer wrecks after changing its Sunday alcohol laws. The New Mexico study cited by Perdue and McKoon has been criticized as flawed.

PolitiFact Georgia found no irrefutable proof that easing Sunday alcohol restrictions ""will result"" in more traffic crashes and fatalities as some Georgia state senators argued earlier this week.

Taxpayer-funded abortions in the federal health care bill?
","
State Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, has brought back a provision of a bill vetoed by Gov. Charlie Crist in 2010 that would prohibit the use of federal or state funding to provide abortion coverage.

And with the bill, he's restating a common and complicated misconception about the federal health care law -- that the bill signed into law by President Barack Obama includes taxpayer-funding for abortions.

Speaking to a House subcommittee on March 16, 2011, Gaetz explained that part of the rationale behind HB 97 was to keep the government out of the business of funding elective abortions. ""I am admittedly pro-life,"" he said. ""But I would think that even for those who are pro-choice, this (elective abortions) would not be the most appropriate use of public funds.""

That's not exactly how it works, though.

Abortion in the health care law

The federal health care law -- if it withstands court challenges -- will create state-run health insurance exchanges in which private companies will compete for the business of people who do not get insurance through their employers. The idea is that it will allow individuals to get group rates enjoyed by those in big employer plans. People who cannot afford insurance will get government subsidies to offset the cost of purchasing a plan in the exchange -- a group of about 19 million people, the government estimates. The subsidy for their coverage would go directly from the government to the insurer, and look like a discount to the policy holder.

How abortion would be handled as part of the health care law predictably became a thorny political issue that threatened the law's very passage, and several alternatives were considered. To pass, the health care bill had to appease anti-abortion conservative Democrats.

The final language signed into law, crafted by abortion opponent Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., allows insurance companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But with a big caveat.

Nelson's provision specifically prohibits the use of federal dollars to fund abortions, except in the case of rape, incest or when the mother's life in peril. Rather, insurance companies would be required to pay for abortion services from a segregated pool of money funded through patient premiums. Essentially, people who select plans that cover abortions would have to pay at least $1 a month of their premiums into a separate account. Any abortion services provided by the insurer would have to be drawn from that segregated account.

On top of that, the national health care law gives states an opt-out of abortion coverage altogether. States could pass laws to prohibit abortion coverage in health plans offered on the state exchange if they chose.

That's what Gaetz's HB 97 attempts to do.

Section 1 of Gaetz's bill states, ""A health insurance policy or group health insurance policy purchased in whole or in part with state or federal funds through an exchange created pursuant to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may not provide coverage for an (elective) abortion... A policy is deemed to be purchased with state or federal funds if it is a policy toward which any tax credit or cost-sharing credit is applied.""

The language is identical to a provision inserted into HB 1143, which also would have required most women to have an ultrasound performed before having an abortion. That bill was vetoed by Crist.

The rhetoric on this issue can be tricky.

The federal law allows tax dollars to subsidize someone's policy even if the individual chooses a plan that covers abortion. So it would certainly be fair to say that many women who cannot currently afford health insurance will be given tax subsidies, and many of them may choose plans that offer abortion services. (But then the law says that states can opt out from that).

But it's not fair to say that taxpayers are paying for elective abortions. Any abortions would be paid through a separate account funded entirely through a portion of premiums paid by people who select a plan that covers abortion services, not from tax dollars. That's an important difference. Everyone who buys into a plan that covers abortion would have to pay into that abortion fund, even men. And for those with moral objections to paying a portion of their premiums for abortion services, the federal law requires that every region offer at least one alternative health plan that does not cover abortion.

During the March 16 hearing on Gaetz's bill, Rep. Lori Berman, D-Boca Raton, said the bill was unnecessary because ""there is no public funding of abortion right now."" 
Berman offered an amendment to keep abortion services a part of at least one plan created by the exchange, but the amendment failed.

In an interview later, Gaetz said his bill is attempting to close a loophole that could allow taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion coverage. He noted that policy holders still would have the ability to purchase optional, additional coverage for abortions.

Our ruling

Abortion foes like Gaetz argue the federal rules are little more than an accounting trick, that if federal subsidies go to someone who chooses a plan that covers abortion, it's the same as taxpayer-funded abortion.

But we think it's misleading to call it taxpayer-funded abortion when the law requires abortions be paid solely through a portion of the premiums (not tax dollars) paid by people who choose a plan that covers abortions.

Jeff Wentworth says few Texans are licensed for concealed handguns
","Defending his legislation to allow concealed handguns on college campuses, state Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, said not many Texans have the state license that’s required to even carry a concealed gun. ""We have over 25 million people who live in Texas and less than 2 percent of them have these licenses,"" he said on CNN on Feb. 22.  According to the 2010 census, about 25.1 million people live in Texas. Next, we turned to the Texas Department of Public Safety. Spokesman Tom Vinger told us that ""a little over 460,000"" people in Texas have concealed handgun licenses. A 1995 Texas law allows adults 21 and older who meet certain requirements, including passing a background check, to get such licenses. Vinger pointed us to the department’s annual reports on active concealed handgun license and instructor counts. As of Dec. 31, Texas has 461,724 active license holders, according to the department’s most recent report, posted online Feb. 14. We also wondered whether other states had a similarly low percentage of concealed handgun-license holders. According to a fact-sheet posted on the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action’s website in April, 40 states have laws allowing individuals to carry handguns, with Florida issuing more carry permits than any other state — 1.7 million. That’s about 9 percent of Florida’s 18.5 million-large population, according to a 2009 estimate by the Census Bureau. So, 1.8 percent of the Texas population is licensed to carry a concealed handgun.

State Rep. Eddie Rodriguez says colleges and universities can allow concealed handgun holders to bring their guns onto campus
","
State Rep. Eddie Rodriguez, D-Austin, recently said he supports the right to carry firearms, but individual schools colleges should decide whether students can pack them rather than legislators approving a blanket law permitting concealed handguns on campuses.

Appearing on CNN on Feb. 22, Rodriguez said: ""Colleges and universities can have guns on campus (now), allow it to happen, and they haven’t done it. He was interviewed alongside state Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, who has authored legislation allowing concealed handguns on college campuses. Only Utah has such a law.

We wondered if colleges can already to permit guns on campus.

To back up Rodriguez, Nate Walker, his chief of staff, pointed us to Section 46.03 of the state penal code, which includes language in place since 1974 listing places where weapons, including firearms, cannot be taken. The law says it’s illegal to bring a firearm on ""the physical premises of a school or educational institution, any grounds or building on which an activity sponsored by a school or educational institution is being conducted, or a passenger transportation vehicle of a school or educational institution, whether the school or educational institution is public or private, unless pursuant to written regulations or written authorization of the institution.""

According to W. Scott Lewis, Texas legislative director of Students for Concealed Carry on Campus, ""a college or university could (now) choose to create an administrative policy overruling the statutory prohibition against possessing a firearm at an educational institution,"" he said, pointing to the same section of the penal code.

Brian Malte, state legislative director for the Washington-based Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for gun regulations, also interpreted the law to mean universities and colleges can grant concealed-carry permit holders permission to bring handguns onto campus ""on a case by case basis.""

Lewis said no Texas college has permitted guns on campus, but in 2007 the Harrold school district, northwest of Fort Worth near Oklahoma, gave employees the OK to carry concealed firearms, a development we confirmed in an August 2008 Associated Press news article. The district’s policy was the first in Texas, the Houston Chronicle reported a month later.

The policy, which refers to the law highlighted by Rodriguez’s aide, states the board ""may, from time to time, authorize specific school employees to possess certain firearms on school property, at school-sponsored or school-sanctioned events, and at board meetings."" Only employees with an up-to-date concealed handgun license are eligible, the policy says.

David Thweatt, the district’s superintendent, told us the policy has not been challenged in court.

Wondering why no college has similarly allowed concealed weapons, we consulted state Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, who as a state senator authored the 1995 legislation allowing Texans to carry concealed handguns.

Patterson pointed to Section 46.035 in the penal code, which he speculated trumps any permission a university may grant to a concealed handgun license holder. The section says it’s illegal for a concealed handgun license holder to carry a handgun on ""the premises where a high school, collegiate, or professional sporting event or interscholastic event is taking place, unless the license holder is a participant and a handgun is used in the event.""

""At what time does the University of Texas campus have a sporting event not going on?"" Patterson said. ""What is a sporting event? Is that a workout? .. I don’t think as a practical matter they could allow anyone to carry a handgun.""

Austin attorney Allen Halbrook, who has defended licensed firearms dealers, pointed out that ""premises"" is defined in the penal code as ""a building or a portion of building"" in the penal code. Halbrook said he thought it would generally be illegal to bring a concealed handgun into a classroom.

But, Halbrook speculated, maybe not other places on campus: ""For instance, if I’m a legal, 21-year-old student who’s qualified to own and possess a handgun, if the college permits it, I could have one in my dorm room,"" he said.

Finally, we turned to state authorities for clarification. Most were mum.

Spokespeople at Texas A&M University, the University of Texas System, the Higher Education Coordinating Board, the Department of Public Safety and the Texas Legislative Council, which Walker said informed Rodriguez about the law by telephone, each declined to comment.

Jerry Strickland, a spokesman for the Texas attorney general’s office, reiterated the prohibition against firearms in school buildings, at sporting events and on ""any grounds or building on which activity sponsored by a school or educational institution is being conducted."" Yet he also noted that firearms aren’t restricted by law from school streets, sidewalks and parking areas.

Strickland declined to comment on whether colleges and universities can allow concealed handgun holders to bring their guns into other areas of campus. ""We have not had occasion to look at that issue thoroughly,"" he said.

Our take: State law allows higher-ed institutions to permit weapons, though concealed handguns are prohibited from sporting and interscholastic events.

"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'Andy Gardiner']","
Majority Leader Andy Gardiner says 'smart cap' bill lets voters decide on new taxes
","
Florida's fiscally conservative Senate wants to leave its mark in the Constitution by more tightly capping the amount of taxes the state could collect in any given year.

On March 15, 2011, the Senate passed what it calls a ""smart cap,"" which would limit increases in future state spending to a formula based on annual growth of population and cost of living. The proposal still needs the approval of the House before it could be placed on the fall 2012 ballot. If it makes it to the ballot, 60 percent of voters would have to approve the amendment before it became law.

Proponents say the measure makes it more difficult to raise taxes. But opponents argue the cap could harm the state during economic downturns, and that the state already has a revenue cap that is calculated by state personal income.

In voicing support for a more restrictive cap, Senate Majority Leader Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, said the proposal will prevent the overuse of taxpayer dollars and will give Floridians a direct voice in charting the state's fiscal course.

""It also gives Floridians a voice, requiring a 60 percent vote by citizens in order to impose a new tax, fee, license, fine, charge or assessment on Floridians,"" Gardiner said in a press release distributed moments after the bill, SJR 958, passed the Senate 27-13.

Our fact-check: Would the cap as proposed by the Senate require voter approval for new taxes or fees?

Background on cap

If enacted, the revenue cap would become effective starting with the 2014-15 budget year. In that year, the state would be allowed to collect an amount equal to the state revenues collected during the 2013-14 budget year plus an adjustment for inflation and population growth. The 2015-16 budget would be created based on revenues from 2014-15 -- with another adjustment for inflation and population growth. And so on.

There are several ways to break the cap, according to lawmakers.

The Legislature, by a two-thirds vote of each chamber, may increase the revenue limitation for any fiscal year, and use that new figure to determine the revenue guidelines by future years.

The Legislature, by a three-fifths vote, may increase the allowable state revenue for any one fiscal year. But those additional revenues would not be counted in future years.

Voters also could be asked to raise the revenue cap, according to analysis of the bill. To do that, two-thirds of the Legislature would have to agree to put the question before voters. Sixty percent of voters would have to agree to raise the revenue cap for the change to be adopted. 
Voter say on new taxes?

So the Legislature could raise the revenue cap by itself, or it could ask voters to raise the revenue cap.

But Gardiner was much more specific -- saying that voters would be required to not just raise the revenue cap, but to approve a new tax or fee.

It turns out, nothing like that is in the proposal.

Gardiner spokeswoman Allison Fogt said he was ""discussing a tax, fee, license, fine, charge or assessment on Floridians that would 'bust the cap.' ""

But even still, any new tax or fee that would break the revenue cap could be passed without voter approval.

At a press conference on March 16, Senate President Mike Haridopolos talked about how the revenue cap doesn't necessarily tie the hands of future Legislatures because they can always override it. ""With a super-majority vote, the Legislature can spend more money,"" he said.

Our ruling

In prepared remarks praising the passage of a Senate bill that would tighten a cap on the amount of revenues the state could collect, Gardiner tried to suggest the legislation also requires 60 percent of voters to approve any new tax or fee.

It doesn't. Voters could be asked to raise the revenue cap, or lawmakers could do it on their own. And the proposal talks about revenue collections in general, not specific taxes or fees.

Bill Kristol says 20 percent of U.S. electricity comes from nuclear power
","
The extensive damage to Japanese nuclear facilities following the massive earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, has focused more attention on nuclear power than it has received in years.

On the March 13, 2011, edition of Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative magazine the Weekly Standard, about how the situation in Japan could affect the use of nuclear power in the United States.

""Bill, at a time when Democrats and Republicans were finally getting together and supporting nuclear power as safe, clean, non-polluting energy, and President Obama had $36 billion in loan credits in his 2012 budget to promote more plants, what happens now to the domestic industry?"" Wallace asked.

Kristol responded, ""Well, we can probably save $36 billion from the 2012 budget because I think it's a bit of a setback to nuclear power here in the U.S. I'll go out on a limb and make that prediction.

""But, you know, people will say, well, we build new plants. Twenty percent of our electricity currently comes from nuclear power plants. I think there are 104 in the United States, two of them around the coast in California. Very earthquake-resistant, but I guess there could be a tsunami there. It sounds like it's the tsunami that did the most damage in Japan.

""So, on the one hand, it's impressive how resistant these things are to damage. On the other hand, I do think, as you say, these alarming fears, whether or not they -- certainly if they come to fruition, and let's hope they don't -- it's obviously a setback to nuclear power. And I think it makes even stronger the case for going after natural gas and oil domestically.""

We wondered whether Kristol’s statistics on electricity generation and the number of nuclear plants were correct -- and we figured our readers would be too. So we looked into it.

We first turned to the Statistical Abstract of the United States, a compendium of statistics published by the U.S. Census Bureau. It includes a table summarizing electricity generation by fuel type through 2009. Dividing net electric generation via nuclear power by net generation in the electric power sector as a whole, we get 20.9 percent. That’s close enough to Kristol’s comment to pass muster with us.

Next, we turned to the website of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agency has a page where you can find active nuclear generating facilities on a map and in alphabetical order. We counted them up, and there are exactly 104 sites listed.

Kristol’s only error was in suggesting that there are 104 nuclear power plants; in fact, there are 104 nuclear power reactors. Because many plants have more than one reactor, the actual number of plants is 65. (This list doesn’t count military and scientific reactors, which are not overseen by the agency.)

Finally, we checked Kristol's claim about nuclear facilities on the California coast. There are, in fact, two: Diablo Canyon, located 12 miles from San Luis Obispo, and San Onofre, located 46 miles from Long Beach. The photographs on the agency's website clearly show that the plants are located near the water.

So Kristol was basically correct, only erring with his mislabeling of ""reactors"" as ""plants."" We rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/16/bill-kristol/bill-kristol-says-20-percent-us-electricity-comes-/

Sen. Sherrod Brown chides GOP, saying vote on health care broke new rules
","
Bolstered by Tea Party support, Republicans seized majority control of the U.S. House of Representatives this year on a pledge to reel in government spending, starting with the repeal of Health Care Reform.

The Republican-controlled house did just, voting to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed by both houses of Congress and signed into law nearly a year ago.

But before taking that vote the Republicans in the house also scuttled ""pay as you go"" provisions that Democrats had restored in 2007, requiring any increased expenditures flowing from a new piece of legislation to be offset by decreases in other programs.

In its place, Republicans approved ""cut as you go,"" which requires that any proposed spending increases be paid for with cuts in other areas. And unlike ""the Democrats’ pay-as-you-go policy, tax increases (including closing of tax loopholes) to pay for new spending are prohibited.

But at the same time, Republicans specifically exempted from the rule votes to extend the Bush tax cuts and the estate tax and alternative minimum tax. Also exempted was the vote to repeal the health care reform legislation.

This moved Sherrod Brown, the senior senator from Ohio to observe that Republicans ""bragged about how every bill was going to be paid for, right from the beginning. And the first bill they put out there, it would be paid for, according to Congressional Budget Office calculations. That's the way things are done in the Congress and have been agreed to by both parties for years and years. They already violated their own rule by not paying for this.""

Given that the Republicans have preached the need to cut the budget, PolitiFact Ohio thought it’d take a look at Brown’s claim.

The Congressional Budget office was created by an act of Congress in 1974 to act as the non-partisan authority on how proposed legislation would affecting the federal budget. When it analyzed the health-care reform legislation, it said the impact over the next 10 years would be a deficit reduction of $143 billion.

That’s what Brown cites when he says the health reform bill would be paid for.

Republicans dispute those estimates and argue that health reform will drive up the deficit. That being the case, they say, the effect of the ""cut as you go"" rule change is moot because repeal would save the taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars -- meaning there would be no spending increase that needed to be offset elsewhere.

Letters from CBO director Douglas W. Elmendorf to House Speaker John Boehner and other congressional leaders warn that all projections carry a degree of speculation because there are economic variables that can reshape revenues and expenditures over the next decade without foreseeability.

Ultimately, who is right may prove to be academic. Republicans acknowledge the repeal vote was symbolic because it’s unlikely the Democratic-controlled Senate will act on the legislation and even if it did, Republicans don’t have enough votes to override an Obama veto.

So where does that leave Brown’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter?

The senator is correct that House Republicans did pledge to not approve any legislation that would push up the federal deficit. The question then is did they, as he said, violate their own rule?

That's where the exemption that was approved with the House rules comes into play. Brown mentioned that exemption during his teleconference, describing it as a loophole Republicans carved out to avoid the cut-as-you-go restrictions. But with that exemption, the repeal vote didn't violate the rule. That's a point of clarification.

"['Georgia', 'Transportation', 'John Lewis']","
Atlanta Streetcar projected to be jobs boon
","
Atlanta leaders heralded the city’s planned streetcar as a boon to downtown.

Starting in 2013, the streetcar would ferry passengers from Centennial Olympic Park through the historic Sweet Auburn neighborhood and to Ebenezer Baptist Church, the heart of the civil rights movement.  

Even better, it would create jobs, according to a newsletter to constituents from U.S. Rep. John Lewis. Under the header ""New jobs created by the Streetcar project,"" it said the line would generate 1,399 jobs to build and run it, and an additional 4,204 when it spurs economic development in surrounding neighborhoods.  

Sounds like a nice deal. But is that what experts really projected? We took a closer look.   

The $72 million streetcar project is part of an ambitious plan to modernize the city’s transit infrastructure, boost tourism and help a downtown core that has suffered since the Downtown Connector was built.

Critics contend it’s a boondoggle and won’t reduce traffic congestion.

Lewis, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and a coalition of local leaders won a major victory in October when they scored a $47.6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation to build it.

Construction is scheduled to begin in 2012, but there’s no guarantee. Last month, Republicans in Congress threatened to yank the project’s funding.

A spokeswoman for Lewis said the newsletter relied on a projection from groups that applied for the Department of Transportation grant. Since it was created by experts and vetted by civil service professionals at the Department of Transportation, Lewis believed it was credible.

We called MARTA, which played a major role in generating the figures. Spokesman Lyle Harris initially declined to explain how the numbers were derived, so we gathered documents from Atlanta Journal-Constitution transportation reporter Ariel Hart, placed a public information request for more documentation and sent written questions, some of which MARTA answered.

Our reporting turned up enough information to evaluate figures for building and running the streetcar, but not for economic development. So we will analyze the projected 1,399 construction and operations jobs.

We found that the job-creation figures are not for actual positions. The Department of Transportation advised grant applicants to use a measure called ""job years.""

""Job years"" means one job lasting for one year. That means that if a single position lasts five years, it counts as five ""job years."" Or as the newsletter put it, ""jobs.""  

The ""job years"" measure has critics. George Mason University professor Stephen Fuller told us it can be confusing or give an inflated impression of the number of jobs a project creates.

""They [officials] want to make people understand that what appears to be a small project will have a big impact over its lifetime,"" Fuller said.

But it does have merits, economists told us. A project should get credit for creating jobs that last many years instead of one. And the measure helps planners tally positions such as construction jobs that rise and fall over the course of a project, said James Horney, a top fiscal policy expert at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

So even though the newsletter said that running the streetcar would create 460 jobs, that doesn’t mean transit officials plan to fill 460 full-time positions to run it.

That’s the number of ""job years"" over a 20-year period. The actual estimate is 23 new employees. And 23 multiplied by 20 is 460.

Brian Riedl, the lead budget analyst for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said there’s a better way to communicate job impact. Just list jobs and job length separately.

So you could say running the streetcar would create 23 jobs that would last 20 years. (Or longer. The line would be built to last.)

Now, let’s look at the claim that the project would create 939 jobs during construction. These jobs are expected to last for one year, so for this phase, one job year equals one job.

But that doesn’t mean 939 people are projected to build the streetcar line, and they won’t all be jobs for Atlantans.  

The newsletter used the project’s ""total employment"" figure, which means the number of people who would be employed for construction, plus two other types of jobs created by the project: those to make materials such as steel or rebar to construct the line, and those created when workers spend their earnings on things such as a roast beef sandwich or a new pair of tube socks.   

The project’s economist estimated this job number using a standard method developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Many of those jobs won’t be local because a portion of the materials and products purchased would be made outside the Atlanta area.

Planners expect to employ 467 workers for streetcar construction. The rest would be making rebar, sandwiches and the like.

So did Lewis get his job creation figures right?

Lewis accurately cited numbers reviewed by government agencies and experts, but in the end, that vetting wasn’t enough. He used figures that would give a typical person the impression that those projected 1,399 ""job years"" are actual jobs. That understanding would be correct for the construction phase, but it would be 20 times higher than the actual number of positions needed to run the streetcar.

Since the figures experts gave Lewis would give a typical person a false impression, we rule his statement False.",/factchecks/2011/mar/16/john-lewis/atlanta-streetcar-projected-be-jobs-boon/

That a large decrease came after World War II should come as little surprise, as government spending went from $9.14 billion in 1939 to $92.71 billion in 1945, with the American government essentially funding most of the global war effort against Germany and Japan.

As the U.S. economy returned to peacetime status, government spending fell by 40.4 percent in the 1946 fiscal year, 37.5 percent the next year and 13.7 percent the year after that.

Comparing spending data to job data is tricky, in part because the Treasury Department, which tracks spending and Gross Domestic Product, operates on a fiscal year that runs from Oct. 1 until Sept. 30. Before 1976 the fiscal year ran July 1 through June 30. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, by contrast, operates on calendar years.

In 1946 private sector employment soared, driven by millions of veterans who came home, left the military and returned to former jobs or took new ones. Strong employment growth continued in 1947 before tailing off in 1948. But again, these changes reflected far more than a cut in government spending. The American economy was far and away the world’s strongest after the war, with much of Europe’s industrial capacity ruined by six years of terrible devastation.

What about the mid-1950s? Government spending fell during two consecutive fiscal years. Private sector jobs dropped in 1954 by 585,000, grew by 2.3 million in 1955 and then climbed by 673,000 in 1956.

In the final case the U.S. economy added more than 2 million private sector jobs in both 1965 and 1966.

Brian Riedl, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, suggested we also look at job expansion in years where government spending grew at a slower rate than GDP. In those years the government essentially becomes a smaller part of the overall economy.

This occurred five times during the 1983 through 1988 fiscal years, and each year the economy had strong employment growth, adding more than 1.5 million jobs annually. In 1983 and 1984, more than 3.4 million annual jobs were added, though that was also a period when the United States was recovering from the severe recession of 1981 and 1982.

GDP also grew faster than government spending between 1992 and 2000. The U.S. gained jobs each of those years, and in all but two of those years more than 2 million private sector jobs were added to the economy. The low point was 1992, when 915,000 new jobs were created.

So again, large job growth has often happened during times when government spending was decreasing or growing slower than GDP. But several economists told us we should not confuse correlation -- the fact that these two things were happening at the same time -- with causation.

Government spending has historically risen during times of recession, as Uncle Sam seeks to prop up the economy. And social programs such as unemployment insurance or food stamps cost more when more people are out of work. At the same time, tax revenue is falling because people who lose jobs pay far less income tax.

Riedl, who said he strongly believes cutting government spending helps grow the private sector, noted that the positive impacts occur in the long-run, not the short-term.

""When federal spending drops that leaves more money for the private sector,"" he said. ""That’s a neutral effect. But over time the private sector is more likely to spend the money in [more] productive ways than the government, and to invest it better than the government.""

The Heritage economist said the lag time for these benefits depends on how the private sector spends any additional funds. Investments in new factories or research projects can take years to return profits to a company and the economy.

Cantor’s staff said their claim was based in part on a blog post by John Taylor, an economist from Stanford University. Taylor has long argued against the stimulus spending. On his blog he disputes reports by Moody’s economist Mark Zandi that the $61 billion in spending cuts proposed by the House GOP would cost the economy 700,000 jobs over 2011 and 2012.

Taylor said that if the government can produce a ""credible"" debt-reduction plan it should ""increase economic growth and reduce unemployment by removing uncertainty and lowering the chances of large tax increases in the future.""

The removal of uncertainty would also stimulate higher investment spending -- on both employees and technology -- by American businesses, Taylor believes. His calls were echoed in a February 13 letter to President Barack Obama from about 150 economists. The letter said action should be taken to immediately ""rein in federal spending.""  

Cantor and other House Republicans are also citing a new report on government spending by Andrew Biggs, Kevin Hassett and Matt Jensen, scholars at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The report, essentially an extended version of a Dec. 29, 2010 op-ed that ran in The Wall Street Journal, stated that cutting federal spending is the most efficient way to balance the budget and feed future economic growth. They claimed deficit reduction programs fail if they are too reliant on tax increases.

Chris Edwards, director tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the GOP is right to pursue spending cuts. But he said the argument that spending cuts would definitely create more private-sector jobs is rooted in political rhetoric, not economic fact.

""I’m not sure talking about jobs is the way to go,"" Edwards said. ""The unemployment rate has more to do with microeconomic factors"" than federal spending plans. Edwards added that the U.S. budget deficit may be increasing uncertainty and making businesses more cautious about hiring, but he said it is virtually impossible to quantify the size of this impact.

Not all economists are convinced the cuts will have a positive impact on jobs. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said the short-term impact of a spending cut is usually negative.

Consider, for example, the $61 billion cut proposed by House Republicans for the current fiscal year. If approved, Burtless said, government agencies might find themselves cutting back on contracts with private companies. Those companies, having less business, might then need to lay off employees to maintain their profits.

""Let’s say a cut to the defense procurement budget leads to a loss of 300,000 defense industry jobs,"" Burtless said by way of example. ""To have any benefit, we now need to add 300,000 jobs to replace the lost ones, then add more.""

Stressing that he does not think the long-term benefits match up to Cantor’s claim, Burtless said that even if it is true, the private sector makes hiring decisions based on economic demand or the need to increase production. The only way to reduce unemployment, he added, is for product demand to increase. 
Let’s review.  

Cantor says ""less government spending equals more private sector jobs."" His staff cites letters and articles by a group of economists.

Total federal spending has only decreased a few times in the past 70 years, and the only large drops came at the end of World War II and the Korean War. Private sector jobs increased after both of those wars, but the gains were driven by many factors, including the return to a peace-time economy and the demobilization of millions of soldiers, many of whom went directly into the private work force.

During larges stretches of the 1980s and 1990s government spending grew at a slower rate than the overall economy, and large job growth occurred. But economists warned us there is a not a direct link between spending policies and job policies.

Cantor may be right with his prescription of lower spending to spur higher job growth. But he goes too far when he asserts a cut equals more private sector jobs. No one knows for sure. The congressman is presenting an economic theory as established fact. We rate this claim Half True. ",/factchecks/2011/mar/16/eric-cantor/eric-spending-says-less-government-spending-equals/

Gail Collins says Perry used $3.2 billion in stimulus money for schools to plug other holes in his budget
","New York Times columnist Gail Collins recently highlighted $830 million in federal education aid for Texas that’s been left dangling in a standoff between Gov. Rick Perry and U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin. In her Feb. 16 column, Collins notes that U.S. House Democrats from Texas set special conditions that the state must meet to get its share of about $10 billion approved last summer for states to help school districts hire and retain teachers. The Democrats, Collins writes, were ""ticked off because Perry used $3.2 billion in stimulus dollars for schools to plug other holes in his budget"" in 2009. In Austin, attorney Terral Smith, a former GOP Texas House member who later worked for Gov. George W. Bush, asked us to check Collins’ statement because he doesn’t think it tells ""the whole story."" Some background: Doggett led last year’s effort setting special hurdles that Texas must clear to get the $830 million. For starters, the money must ""supplement and not supplant state"" funding, and the governor must assure that the state will not reduce the percentage of its budget going to public education through 2013. The law requires governors of other states to make a similar promise, but only through 2011. And while every other state may decide how to distribute that money to schools, Texas must follow a federal formula that directs more aid to districts serving many students from low-income families. According to Austin American-Statesman news articles, Perry says he cannot make the two-year commitment because appropriating state money is the Legislature’s responsibility, not the governor’s, and the Texas Constitution does not allow a governor to bind legislatures to future spending. The Legislature is currently drafting the 2012-13 budget. Doggett says the Texas language was intended to prevent a repeat of what happened in 2009 with $3.25 billion in education stimulus funding while lawmakers were writing the 2010-11 budget. ""Governor Perry played a shell game that left Texas schools not a dime better off than if no federal aid had come in the first place,"" Doggett said in remarks on the House floor Feb. 18. Doggett spokeswoman Sarah Dohl told us by e-mail that the federal assistance enabled the state to free up some of its own funds to plug other holes in the budget. Is that what really happened? Collins, making the case for her statement, cited a page in the 2010-11 state budget breaking down the federal stimulus dollars that flowed through the Texas Education Agency. The page shows an infusion of $3.25 billion and a reduction of the same amount in general revenue — state dollars — budgeted for public education. So, straight swap-out? Texas experts said it’s not so clear-cut. Eva DeLuna Castro, senior budget analyst for the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, told us that the ""reduction"" shown in general revenue does not mean lawmakers moved state money from education to other parts of the budget, like prisons. Her point: Lawmakers did not expect to have enough money to cover the $3.25 billion in education expenses to begin with. They penciled in the stimulus funds to make up for ""a lack of state revenue,"" she said. All told, according to a June 19, 2009, Statesman story, the Legislature that year used $12 billion in stimulus money to balance the 2010-11 budget, leaving ""untouched the state's estimated $9.1 billion rainy day fund,"" which accumulates revenue mainly from oil and gas production taxes. School finance expert and lobbyist Lynn Moak, whose clients include a consortium of the state’s largest school districts, also told us that the state used the $3.25 billion in stimulus funds to pay for education costs it couldn’t otherwise cover on its own. He said the $3.25 billion in federal money could be roughly broken into two pieces. About $1.4 billion made up for the projected loss of income from a state endowment fund covering textbook purchases and part of the state’s share of education funding. Moak said the other $1.9 billion paid for increases in state aid to districts and $800 pay raises for teachers and some other personnel that lawmakers approved during the session. DeLuna Castro told us that the Legislature either had to find a way to pay the $3.25 billion in educational expenses or change the laws governing the spending. If the stimulus funds had not arrived, how could Texas have paid the education costs? According to a September 2010 report by the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, which represents several hundred largely Texas-based businesses and legal and accounting firms, lawmakers would have had to draw from the rainy day fund, raise taxes to bring in more revenue or cut spending elsewhere in the budget. Texas avoided doing any of that by using the stimulus money to ""backfill"" funding for public education, the report says. Backfilling, plugging holes — what does that mean? Simply put, the state used federal dollars to meet spending obligations it would otherwise have had to cover with its own money or cut that spending altogether. The report points to a March 2010 study of 20 states, including Texas, stating that they all ""in essence ‘backfilled budget holes’"" with federal education stimulus dollars. Next, we reached Michael Rebell, an author of the study, which was conducted by the Campaign for Educational Equity, an education policy research center at Columbia University’s Teachers College. Rebell, the campaign’s executive director, told us what the states did was not illegal. ""In fact, it was the overwhelming pattern"" among the states studied, he said. We reviewed the stimulus law and found no prohibition against using the federal money to supplant state funding. However, there were many indications that the Obama administration wanted the money to be used to expand state education efforts in several areas noted in the stimulus legislation, including improving teacher effectiveness and supporting struggling schools. In a June 18, 2009, letter to the Pennsylvania governor, Education Secretary Arne Duncan wrote: ""If a state has done nothing more than backfill budget holes with these dollars when the state had other resources available to it, such as a rainy-day fund, the state's competitive position to receive (future stimulus money) may be negatively impacted."" The following month, the Texas Education Agency announced that the U.S. Education Department had approved the state’s application to receive the $3.25 billion in education stimulus funding. Finally, we asked the experts whether Collins’ take on how the state used the $3.25 billion was a fair one. Responses varied. Moak said that in his view, lawmakers used those federal funds ""like it was general revenue, and they put it where they thought it was easiest to justify putting it and follow the law at the same time."" Had the state not received the federal aid, the Legislature would have had to take money from other parts of the budget to pay for the education expenses, ""assuming that they weren’t going to raise revenue"" or change the laws mandating the spending, he said. Dick Lavine, senior fiscal analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, told us that supplanting state education funds with stimulus money freed up $3.25 billion in general revenue for other state operations. Whether that plugged holes depends on whether the state would have cut spending for those operations if the money hadn’t been there, Lavine said. Talmadge Heflin, director of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation's Center for Fiscal Policy, described Collins’ claim as ""disputable."" He said lawmakers used the stimulus money to pay for education expenses that might not have otherwise been fully funded. ""Simply because no new (education) initiatives were funded is not grounds for claiming money was shifted from education to other purposes,"" he said. Dale Craymer, TTARA’s president, said: ""The federal stimulus dollars used for education were lawfully used for education and were not diverted for other purposes. As introduced, and before the stimulus money became available, the proposed 2010-11 (state) budget was in the red. We simply could not divert money we did not have in the first place."" Summing up: Collins gives Perry too much credit for apportioning funds; the Legislature did that when it wrote the budget that Perry signed it into law. She also incorrectly implies that the $3.25 billion in education stimulus funds did not go to schools — it did. But there is an element of truth to Collins’ larger point. Federal stimulus dollars for education made it possible for Texas budget writers to put some of the state’s general revenue funds elsewhere. Broadly, an even greater infusion of stimulus money helped to get Texas out of a tight budget fix and keep its rainy day fund intact. We rate Collins’ statement Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2011/mar/16/gail-collins/gail-collins-says-perry-used-32-billion-stimulus-m/
