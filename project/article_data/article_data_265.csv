Tucker Carlson’s false claim that elites in Washington ignored the opioid epidemic in rural America
","Before Election Day, Fox News host Tucker Carlson explained why supporters of President Donald Trump love him so much. Tucker gave the example of thousands of people at a Trump rally in Butler, Pa. They loved Trump, Carlson said, largely because ""because no one else loves them."" ""The country they built, the country their ancestors fought for over hundreds of years, has left them to die in their unfashionable little towns,"" Carlson said. ""Mocked and despised by the sneering half wits with finance degrees, but no actual skills, who seem to run everything all of a sudden."" Carlson found proof of this disdain from ""the professional class"" in the opioid epidemic that ravaged Butler. ""When large numbers of people in Butler started killing themselves with narcotics, no one in Washington or New York or Los Angeles said a word about it,"" Carlson said. ""Whatever Donald Trump's faults, he is better than the rest of the people in charge. At least he doesn't hate them for their weakness."" We can’t quantify whether leaders in Washington or large cities on the East and West coasts hate people in smaller cities and towns beset by opioid addiction, but we can assess whether these leaders ignored the epidemic. The pattern that emerges from the record of budgets and reports, and from interviews, is that the response at both the federal and state levels was slow in coming, but the epidemic was not ignored. Butler is just north of Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania. The city has only about 13,000 people, but nearly 188,000 people live in Butler County. The area has lost manufacturing jobs over the decades, but it is no post-industrial wasteland. The AK Steel Corp, maker of rolled steel and other products, is the county’s fourth largest employer.  There are theaters and museums, and fans of local beer can tour a dozen microbreweries.  Amenities aside, like every part of the country, Butler County has struggled with opioid addiction. Compared with other Pennsylvania counties, it has an overdose death rate that is about average — 24 deaths per 100,000 in 2018. That’s essentially unchanged from four years ago, but the rate spiked to 50 per 100,000 in 2017, before dropping back down. Emergency room physician Jeanmarie Perrone in Philadelphia said that by about 2008 or so, it was clear that prescribing opioids wasn’t making people better. But it took a few more years for doctors and the public health community to see that opioid addiction had spread widely.  ""The awareness came that this wasn't an urban problem, the pills were ubiquitous,"" Perrone said. ""You didn't need to be in a city to find a doctor to prescribe them."" Perrone said that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration was the first to sound the alarm, followed by the Justice Department and later still, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Congress and the Obama administration were not silent about prescription opioids such as oxycontin, but it took awhile for them to back up their words with dollars.  In 2011, the Obama administration unveiled the government’s first plan to tackle prescription drug abuse. ""Prescription drug abuse is the nation’s fastest-growing drug problem,"" a White House report said.  It listed the statistics. A four-fold increase in 10 years in the amount of opioids prescribed. Between 2000 to 2009, the number of prescriptions rose by nearly 50% to reach 257 million. But the report dialed back the urgency. ""These realities demand action, but any policy response must be approached thoughtfully, while acknowledging budgetary constraints at the state and Federal levels,"" the report said. ""Any policy in this area must strike a balance between our desire to minimize abuse of prescription drugs and the need to ensure access for their legitimate use."" That lack of urgency allowed the problem to fester.  ""The problem was already severe in 2008, and it got worse every year after,"" said Andrew Kolodny, medical director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University. ""It wasn’t until 2015 that the administration and Congress began to address the problem."" In March 2015, the administration said it wanted an additional $99 million to focus on curtailing opioid prescription trends and reduce opioid deaths. In February 2016, the president’s budget called for $1 billion over two years to ""expand access to treatment for prescription drug abuse and heroin use."" The sense that more needed to be done grew, but Johns Hopkins School of Public Health epidemiologist Caleb Alexander said Carlson’s dichotomy of coastal elites and inland workers doesn’t hold up. ""I don’t think that this is a Washington vs. Main Street matter,"" Alexander said. ""It is a matter of a broad and multifaceted epidemic that has impacted urban and rural America alike."" In Pennsylvania, Perrone said the sense among frontline workers was less that of abandonment by the government, and more that of uncertainty of how to respond. ""Nobody knew what to do,"" Perrone said. ""You couldn’t just stop giving opioids. You couldn’t take them all off the market. We were teaching doctors to prescribe them more safely, but that’s not easy. The horse was out of the barn, and there wasn’t an obvious answer as to what would work."" Perrone added that the makers and distributors of prescription opioids formed a potent lobby that successfully argued against any moves that would reduce their sales. Carlson’s point that Washington ignored places like Butler County is undercut by a working group of U.S. attorneys. They met in 2014 to tackle the epidemic and presented a plan to change their approach. The head of that group was David Hickton, the U.S. attorney for Western Pennsylvania. Hickton also co-chaired a national Justice Department task force on addiction. We reached out to Fox News and did not hear back. Carlson said that as opioid deaths climbed in rural communities, ""no one in Washington or New York or Los Angeles said a word about it."" Carlson went so far as to say that the elites ""mocked and despised"" such communities. Looking at the response at the federal level, literally speaking, Carlson is wrong. By 2011, the administration had put forth a strategy to reduce prescription opioid deaths. The U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania led a Justice Department task force focused on the epidemic. There is room to criticize Washington for failing to put more money into the problem sooner, but by 2015, the White House was calling for a major increase in spending of $1 billion over two years. A frontline clinician at a Philadelphia hospital said if the response was delayed, it was partly because the sense of what would work evolved along with the epidemic.

North Carolina and Wisconsin did not have more votes cast than registered voters
","The 2020 election, with no declared winner as of the morning of Nov. 5 and votes still being tallied, is generating plenty of misinformation about the number of votes cast, and by whom. One claim about North Carolina and Wisconsin is that the number of votes in each of those states was higher than the number of registered voters.  One Facebook post says, ""How is this possible?"" with a chart showing that in North Carolina, 5,160,000 people are registered to vote and 5,387,496 people cast votes there, for a turnout rate of 104.41%; and in Wisconsin, 3,129,000 people are registered to vote and 3,240,275 people cast ballots there, for a turnout rate of 103.56%.

The post asks ""How is this possible?"" and the answer is simple: It’s not.  The incorrect numbers of registered voters included in the claim appear to come from outdated 2018 voter registration statistics.  In 2020, North Carolina had 7.36 million registered voters and 5.49 million votes cast, for 74.6% voter turnout, according to the state’s Board of Elections. Wisconsin had 3,684,726 registered voters on Nov. 1, the state’s Elections Commission reported, and 3.2 million people voted, for at least 71% voter turnout, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The Wisconsin Elections Commission tweeted via its verified account that the state allows election-day registration, so the voter registration numbers that some counties include in unofficials results are ""not a true indicator of registration.""  PolitiFact previously checked the claim about Wisconsin having more votes cast than registered voters and rated it Pants on Fire.  This claim suffers the same fate.

No, President Trump, ‘ballot dumps’ in key states were not a magical surprise
","The day after Election Day, as Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden was gaining ground in key battleground states, President Donald Trump decried what he saw as unfairness in the ballot counting. ""Last night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run & controlled,"" Trump tweeted on Nov. 4. ""Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE, and the ‘pollsters’ got it completely & historically wrong!"" Last night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run & controlled. Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE, and the “pollsters” got it completely & historically wrong! Trump may have a point about polling being wrong, but we’ll set that aside until analysts dig into the question. Here, we’ll look at whether Trump was leading in key states controlled by Democrats but lost due to ""surprise ballot dumps.""  Trump is wrong on multiple levels. Variations in who led the vote count in a particular state stemmed from the normal tabulation processes playing out for counting mail-in votes. It wasn’t because Democrats were doing something improper. The ""ballot dumps"" were not a surprise. Officials have warned for months that one of the consequences of the flood of mail ballots — a byproduct of the pandemic — is that they take longer to count. Many Democrats chose to vote by mail or through drop boxes, while many of Trump’s supporters decided to vote at the polls on Election Day since Trump had been critical of mail ballots. Different states and even counties within a state have different rules for what ballots were tabulated first. This meant that when jurisdictions released their most recent ballot counts on Election Night, how the ballot was cast became highly correlated with the likelihood of that batch of ballots being strong for either Biden or Trump. By the wee hours of the morning after the election, significant numbers of ballots remained to be counted in the Democratic strongholds of Pennsylvania such as Philadelphia, the Philadelphia suburbs and Pittsburgh. Similarly, in Wisconsin and Michigan, the Democratic areas of Milwaukee and Detroit had significant numbers of ballots that remained to be counted. Trump’s lead in Georgia — like the three others, a state Trump won in 2016 — had also narrowed, with Biden making gains in and around Atlanta.  Because of these factors, lead-switching between the candidates was not a sign of something amiss. It was just a sign of the process unfolding and all ballots cast being counted. And lead switches happen even in the best of circumstances, when high, pandemic-driven levels of mail ballots are not being used. ""We have 50 different election systems in the United States,"" said Colorado State University political scientist Kyle Saunders. ‘Some of them are well financed with great infrastructure, some are not. Some can release their results quickly, many cannot. Those who release their results slowly also release those results as they come in. That means the patterns that you see with 40% of the vote in are likely to be quite different than after all of the vote is in. It completely depends on the order in which counties or regions of a state report their results."" Trump jumped out to a lead in certain states, only to see that lead narrow or disappear entirely. This was the case in Wisconsin and Michigan, and it may yet happen in Pennsylvania and Georgia as the final ballots are counted. But the same thing happened to Biden elsewhere. Decision Desk HQ, a private vote-tracking firm, initially colored several states blue for Biden early in the evening based on initial returns, including Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, and South Carolina. Another state, Virginia, was shaded red at the time.  Hours later, Florida, Kentucky and South Carolina turned red, and Virginia turned blue for Biden. But four other states were initially shaded blue for Biden: North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas, while two states were briefly shaded red, Rhode Island and Maine.  Still later, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas had all become red, while Rhode Island and Maine had been recast as blue.  After the polls closed, the New York Times tracked whether Trump or Biden led as more ballots were counted over time. Their data shows that in at least four states, Biden was ahead for a while before Trump took the lead: Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Another state saw Biden jump out to an initial lead before seeing Trump eat into his edge, though Biden was eventually called the winner in Arizona. The North Carolina pattern was particularly notable, because Biden was ahead as the first 80% of ballots were counted, before falling behind Trump after that. So the leads changed in many states over the course of the night — and in both directions, not just the one Trump was complaining about. A final note: Trump blames Democratic partisans for the counting rules. But beyond the fact that election officials are abiding by the law and operating under professional neutrality, the four states Trump seemed to be most concerned about all have Republican legislatures, and Georgia has both a Republican legislature and a Republican governor. ""It has nothing to do with whether they were ‘Democrat-run’ or not,"" said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz.  Trump said, ""Last night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run & controlled. Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted."" In some states, Trump did initially lead, only to see Biden surge back and take the lead. But in others, Biden led and Trump came back from behind to take the lead. The allegation of ""surprise ballot dumps"" is flat wrong. Officials had been warning about delays in counting for months. Variations in the ballot counting were due to the normal tabulation playing out, and it didn’t have to do with anything improper by Democrats.

Fact-checking a conspiracy theory about ballot counting in battleground states
","A pro-Trump singer-songwriter is spreading misinformation about the ongoing vote count in several key battleground states. In a widely shared Facebook post, Joy Villa claimed Democrats in six states were deliberately delaying ballot counts to hurt President Donald Trump’s re-election chances. ""Six states can't get the votes counted,"" says text in the image, which was posted after 3 a.m. EST on Nov. 4. ""Six states in which @realDonaldTrump is leading. Six states where Dems are in charge."" ""Unbelievable,"" Villa wrote in the caption. ""The Democrats are trying to steal this election from @realdonaldtrump. He WON. PERIOD!"" Villa’s post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s a screenshot of a Nov. 4 tweet from Villa, which has been shared more than 11,000 times. We reached out to Villa for evidence to back up her claim, but we haven’t heard back. It’s unclear which states Villa was referring to, but her post is similar to other claims that said officials halted vote tallies in battleground states like Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania to sway the results in favor of former Vice President Joe Biden. Those claims are inaccurate. (Screenshot from Facebook) First, Trump has not won the election, despite claims from the president himself and social media users. A few key states that determine the path to the White House remain uncalled.  As of 5:45 p.m. EST on Nov. 4, the Associated Press had called a few battleground states in favor of Biden, including Wisconsin, Minnesota and Arizona. Other swing states, including Iowa, Texas, Ohio and Florida, have been called for Trump. Some states in which Trump was leading overnight on Nov. 3 experienced delays in the ballot-counting process due to an influx of mail-in ballots, spurred by the coronavirus pandemic and preferred by Democratic voters. There is no evidence that states are deliberately stalling vote tabulation. In three states — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which have Democratic governors — election officials were not allowed to start counting mail-in ballots until Election Day or just before. That resulted in reporting delays overnight on Nov. 3, since mail ballots take more time to count than in-person votes.  Here’s the status of those states (which were all toss-ups around in the early morning hours of Nov. 4) as of 5:45 p.m. EST: About 92% of precincts in Pennsylvania have reported their in-person votes, and about 41% of mail ballots are outstanding. Trump has an edge on Biden. The AP has called Wisconsin for Biden.  Every major TV network has called Michigan for Biden.  The situation in the South and the West is a little different. Georgia, which has a Republican governor, experienced a delay after a pipe burst at a ballot counting facility in Atlanta. The Georgia secretary of state told reporters that, as of 5 p.m. EST, there were about 185,000 uncounted ballots in the state. North Carolina, which has a Democratic governor, is finished counting in-person votes, but it will count provisional and absentee ballots that arrive by Nov. 12 as long as they’re postmarked by Election Day. Democrat-led Nevada, where polls closed later than other battleground states, also remains uncalled as it continues to count mail ballots, but Biden has an edge over Trump. RELATED: Battleground states did not ‘stop counting’ votes on election night when Trump was ahead Those delays do not indicate that anything is wrong — rather, they highlight the difficulty of holding an election during the coronavirus pandemic. ""Election results reporting may occur more slowly than prior years,"" says the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency on a ""rumor control"" page. ""This does not indicate there is any problem with the counting process or results. Official results are not certified until all validly cast ballots have been counted, including ballots that are counted after election night.""

This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook post falsely characterized the status of counting ballots in Nevada as of Nov. 4 when the margin between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden was too close to call.  The Facebook post included a screengrab of a headline from Breitbart: ""Nevada: No more election results expected until Thursday."" In that story, Breitbart cited a tweet by the Elections Division of the Nevada Secretary of State posted 2:45 a.m. PST Nov. 4. ""That’s it for election results updates until 9:00 am on Nov. 5,"" the tweet stated. That’s it for election results updates until 9:00 am on Nov. 5. Here’s what has been counted so far:All in person early votesAll in person Election Day votesAll mail ballots through Nov. 21/2 ' By that point, all in-person ballots had been counted as well as mail ballots received through Nov. 2. However, election officials still had to count mail ballots received on Election Day as well as those received over the next several days and provisional ballots. ""Ballots outstanding is difficult to estimate in Nevada because every voter was sent a mail ballot. Obviously, not all will vote,"" the state elections office tweeted.  While the state elections office announced it would not post another update until Nov. 5, the counting of ballots still continued, said Jennifer Russell, a spokesperson for the Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske. Russell told PolitiFact the afternoon of Nov. 4 that it was possible that the state would post an update on that day. The responsibility for processing ballots lies with the counties, so we went in search of a county elections official to explain the status of their count. Washoe County, home to Reno and evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, has about 300,000 voters, the second highest in the state. Washoe elections officials stopped counting around 12:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time Nov. 4. By that point, elections workers had completed counting all of the in person ballots as well as mail ballots received through Nov. 2, said county spokesperson Bethany Drysdale. Election workers resumed work at 8 a.m. PST Nov. 4 with processing the mail-in ballots and dropbox ballots from Election Day, which adds up to about 9,000 ballots. The county expects to post results after that process is completed, expected at 10 a.m. Thursday ""Processing means sorting, scanning, verifying signatures, and eventually counting. They can't tally the ballots until they've gone through all the prep steps,"" Drysdale said. It was never the intention of the state to announce the final result on election night, Russell said. State law says that election officials have until Nov. 10 to receive mail ballots postmarked by Nov. 3. Voters have until Nov. 12 to ""cure"" their ballots if they forgot to sign them or if there was a signature mismatch. Nevada will certify results on Nov. 16. Trump lost Nevada in 2016. This fall he lobbed misleading attacks on mail in voting in the battleground state. RELATED: Trump’s misleading claim about ballot signatures in Nevada A Facebook post on Nov. 4 said ""Now that it’s even, Nevada decides to stop counting and is now not going to count anything until TOMORROW!

""Behind the blue line, there is also a red line representing thousands of votes Trump gained. There are also counter examples where Trump’s line shoots up suddenly when a favorable batch of results are reported.""  FiveThirtyEight writer Maggie Koerth wrote a blog update about Wisconsin at 8:27 a.m., saying that Biden had been down in Wisconsin before absentee results from Milwaukee came in early that morning.  ""The boost pushed him up past Trump, but the race in this state is still very, very tight,"" she wrote. ""Biden and Trump are both at 49 percent, with only about 20,000 votes separating them."" Geoffrey Skelley, an elections analyst at FiveThirtyEight, wrote an update about Michigan around the same time, saying that with 86% of the expected vote reporting there, Trump had ""only a slight edge over Biden"" and that Biden still had a good chance of winning the state once all the votes were counted.  We’ve separately checked claims that Biden received a suspicious surge of votes in these states: One post falsely said Wisconsin found 112,000 votes at 3 a.m. and a tweet got it wrong when it alleged that Biden had received a sudden influx of 138,339 votes in Michigan while Trump received none.  These FiveThirtyEight graphs are also being misleadingly cast as evidence that Biden is benefiting from an illegal ballot boon.  We rate that suggestion False.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Are votes being ""found"" in Wisconsin? ""Absolutely no ballots were ‘found’,"" Reid Magney, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, told PolitiFact. ""All of the election results that were reported in the early morning hours of Wednesday were valid ballots that were received by 8 p.m. on Election Day according to the law."" Clerks are required to continue counting ballots until all ballots have been counted, Magney said. Magney said he didn’t know exactly what the Facebook post was referring to by its mention of 112,000 votes. But he said that perhaps the post was alluding to counts of absentee ballots. The most populous county in Wisconsin, Milwaukee County, has 19 municipalities. Eight of those municipalities, including the City of Milwaukee, process their absentee ballots at a central location within the municipality. The other 11 municipalities process absentee ballots at their respective polling locations.

""They are estimating, three to four hours,"" he said, ""So, we're upping our estimates and hoping to be done by about 3 a.m., that’s better than 5 a.m."" As of mid-afternoon Nov. 4, Milwaukee County’s election results page said it was last updated at 3:56 a.m. Julietta Henry, director of elections for Milwaukee County, said she also didn’t know where the 112,000 reference in the Facebook post was coming from, but she refuted claims of ballots being ""found."" ""We are not finding ballots, ballots are being counted,"" Henry said. Wisconsin election officials on Nov. 2, before Election Day, posted information alerting the public that due to the coronavirus pandemic and a high number of absentee ballots, it would likely be Wednesday before all the unofficial results were in. ""It doesn’t mean something went wrong — it means election officials are doing their jobs and making sure every legitimate ballot gets counted,"" said Meagan Wolfe, Wisconsin’s chief election official. A Facebook post claimed, ""Wisconsin found 112k votes at 3am."" The suggestion that ballots randomly appear is wrong. Election officials in Wisconsin told us that they didn’t know what the post specifically meant by the 112,000 reference. The City of Milwaukee was still counting absentee ballots around 3 a.m., but that doesn’t mean that those ballots were found or appeared at that time. We rate the Facebook post False.

There’s Nothing ‘Mysterious’ About California’s Mail-In Voting System, Despite False Facebook Claim
","A provocative but unfounded post from conservative commentator Tomi Lahren has gone viral on Facebook suggesting key states in the presidential race are starting to ""flip blue"" due to a fraudulent mail-in voting system such as the one used in California.  ""This is the California model spreading across the country. When you need to flip things blue there’s always some mysterious mail-in ballots lying around that’ll do the trick. Shameful!""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s effort to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.) It received more than 700,000 views and 25,000 likes on the platform by early Wednesday afternoon. Facebook added a warning label at the bottom of the post citing the trustworthiness of voting by mail. With the nation’s focus on the still-undetermined presidential race, we set out to fact check Lahren’s claim. A ‘False And Unsupported Statement’  While early election night results in several battleground states favored President Donald Trump, continued counting and reporting on Wednesday of legally voted mail-in ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan have turned the still-preliminary results in favor of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden.  Several battleground states were legally not allowed to tally mail-in votes before Election Day. That meant many votes from Democrats, who relied much more heavily on mail-in voting, were reported after figures from Tuesday’s in-person voting, which Republicans relied on in greater numbers.  Officials in those states have not cited evidence that unexplained mail-in ballots are turning states ""blue.""  ""There is no support for the claim that ballots ‘lying around’ are mysteriously included in the count. This is a false and unsupported statement,"" Rick Hasen, a UC Irvine law professor and elections expert, wrote in an email, referring to both the contested states and California. ""Despite all of the complaints about third party collection of ballots (sometimes referred to pejoratively as ‘ballot harvesting’) there has been no evidence of any widespread fraud with mail in ballots in California elections,"" he added. Republicans in 2018 criticized a new state law that allows anyone, even campaign workers, to collect and return mail-in ballots, which they dubbed ""ballot harvesting.""  Later-arriving mail-in ballots, some collected under this new law, helped several Democratic congressional candidates win during that year’s midterm election after Republicans had more votes counted on Election Day. Asked about Lahren’s post, Sam Mahood, a spokesperson for the California Secretary of State’s Office, said it ""offers no evidence.""  ""Voting-by-mail has been popular in red, blue, and purple states for years. It’s a secure and transparent process. Vote counting is open to the public and campaigns to view,"" Mahood wrote.  He added there’s been no indication of any large-scale fraud tied to mail-in voting during the current election. For longtime California voters, there’s nothing ""mysterious"" about mail-in ballots. Voters of all political stripes have used them safely and securely for decades to help both Democrats and Republicans win.  The process — traditionally called absentee voting and now more commonly called mail-in voting or vote-by-mail — has been allowed for anyone who’s registered, and for any reason, since 1979, according to the California Voter Foundation. A record 72% of votes cast in the California primary were by mail, a figure that’s expected to be surpassed once all the state’s general election ballots are counted in the weeks ahead.  Mail-in ballots, in fact, were instrumental in the May special election victory by Republican Rep. Mike Garcia in northern Los Angeles County, undercutting the repeated claim by President Donald Trump that they favor Democrats and lead to corruption.  Election experts, along with state and county election officials and numerous studies have all rejected claims that mail-in ballots lead to widespread fraud. The studies include a 5-year investigation by the George W. Bush administration that turned up virtually no evidence of any organized effort to skew federal elections.  There have been cases of voters trying to cheat using mail-in ballots, but experts say it’s not systemic. When it happens, it gets caught.  ""Election fraud of all sorts is rare. There is a slightly less rare instance of voter fraud by absentee balloting,"" Charles Stewart, co-director of the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project, which analyzes election systems, told us in June. ""There are greater temptations and opportunities. Nonetheless, they are rare.""  Stewart pointed to one exception: A Miami mayoral election in 1998 ""that ended up being full of mail ballot fraud.""  More recently, Justin Levitt, a professor at the Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, examined United States elections from 2000 to 2014. He found just 31 credible incidents of voter fraud of any kind over that period, during which more than a billion votes were cast. Our Ruling A popular Facebook post from commentator Tomi Lahren said ""mysterious mail-in ballots lying around"" helped flip key states in the race for the White House for Democrat Joe Biden. It also suggested California’s mail-in voting system is fraudulent.  There’s no evidence that election officials discovered new or illegal ballots ""lying around"" after Election Day. Several battleground states where early results from Tuesday’s in-person vote favored President Trump continued counting legally-voted mail-in ballots Tuesday night and Wednesday. Those ballots can take longer to count and some states were prohibited from starting to tally them until Tuesday.  Additionally, Democratic voters relied more heavily on mail-in ballots, which explains why the early results have shifted.  Election experts and county election officials along with numerous studies have rejected the idea that mail-in ballots in California or any other state lead to widespread fraud.  Lahren’s post is making waves on social media. But it’s not backed up by the facts.  We rated it False.  FALSE – The statement is not accurate.",/factchecks/2020/nov/04/facebook-posts/theres-nothing-mysterious-about-californias-mail-v/

No, Biden did not receive thousands of mysteriously surfaced votes in Michigan
","Widespread posts about vote tallies in Michigan are taking off online as conservatives ramp up their efforts to sow doubt over the legitimacy of legally cast ballots counted after Election Day. Hours after President Donald Trump called for the counting of votes cast before Election Day to cease and falsely declared that he’d won reelection, right-leaning pundits and politicians began circulating a pair of misleading screenshots that they claimed showed potential election fraud in Michigan. The screenshots showed a change in the vote tallies as they appeared on the elections map powered by Decision Desk HQ, an election data and analysis service. The photos appeared to show that in one update overnight, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden received a sudden influx of 138,339 votes in Michigan while other candidates received none.  ""An update gives Biden 100% of new votes — 128k+,"" said Matt Mackowiak, founder of a GOP political communications firm, in one of the first tweets that spotlighted the two screenshots. Mackowiak later deleted his tweet, which Twitter had labeled as potentially misleading. ""I have now learned the MI update referenced was a typo in one county,"" he wrote in a second tweet.  A screenshot of Matt Mackowiak's since-deleted tweet about Michigan. But the correction hasn’t gotten nearly the same attention as the first tweet, which was spread widely among conservatives. Many claimed the photos showed proof of ""fraud"" or ""theft"" or illegality by Democrats in Michigan who had ""magically found"" ballots for Biden, the former vice president. Trump shared a retweet of Mackowiak’s tweet, writing, ""What is this all about?""  WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? https://t.co/6487pYLZnL Similarly misleading claims based on the same screenshots also circulated on Facebook, where they were flagged as part of the platform’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In reality, the influx of 138,339 votes for Biden referenced in the social media posts were the result of a data error, said Drew McCoy, a spokesperson for Decision Desk HQ. They were not indicative of voter fraud, mysteriously surfaced votes or other nefarious actions by Democrats. ""It was a simple error from a file created by the state that we ingested,"" McCoy said of the viral screenshots, noting that Decision Desk HQ does not make changes to state-provided files.  ""The state noticed the error and produced an updated count,"" McCoy said. ""Once they did, we updated the count accordingly. This happens on election night, and we expect other vote tabulators in (Michigan) experienced this error and corrected in real-time like we did."" The correction appears to be reflected in tweets Decision Desk HQ sent as the results trickled in from Michigan on Nov. 4. In one tweet posted at 5:04 a.m. EST, the service reported 2,130,695 votes for Biden and 2,200,902 votes for Trump. In another tweet at 5:43 a.m. EST, the service reduced the vote count for Biden, putting him at 2,019,899 votes to Trump’s 2,217,540. As the Detroit Free Press noted, several Twitter users responded to the 5:04 a.m. EST tweet saying that the error seemed to be linked to the vote totals in Shiawassee County. ""This kind of funkiness is typical,"" said Alex Halderman, a professor of computer science and engineering and elections security expert at the University of Michigan. ""Preliminary results are sometimes updated manually by copying and pasting from a spreadsheet. The error could simply be that one candidate's totals were updated but not the other's."" Votes that were cast legally on or before Election Day are still being counted in Michigan and in other battleground states, as is routine for presidential elections and unsurprising in a pandemic. Experts have warned for months that results could be slowed by the high use of mail-in ballots. Absentee ballots in the state are expected to tilt toward Biden, the Detroit Free Press reported. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a Nov. 4 press conference that she was not aware of the social media posts alleging a mysterious or fraudulent influx of overnight votes cast for Biden. She warned about ""the use of false graphics to try to indicate that there’s some sort of problem happening"" and encouraged the public to consult official state sources for the results.  ""We understand that the eyes of the nation are on Michigan right now, and our voters and these ballots,"" Benson said. ""We’re committed to ensuring accuracy and that every vote is counted and every ballot is validated."" A number of tweets claimed that Biden received a suspicious, potentially fraudulent influx of 138,339 votes in Michigan overnight while other candidates received none. The update that appeared to show large numbers of ballots delivered to Biden all at once was the result of a data error, the spokesperson for Decision Desk HQ told PolitiFact.  The error was promptly corrected and not indicative of voter fraud or any other nefarious action by Democrats or the state.  We rate such claims False.

Battleground states did not ‘stop counting’ votes on election night when Trump was ahead
","A winner of the presidential election wasn’t declared on Nov. 3, because several states that looked favorable for President Donald Trump ""decided to stop counting"" votes — that’s what Facebook users are contending. A Nov. 4 post includes screenshots of purported election results in five battleground states: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina and Wisconsin. Michigan is listed twice. ""Good morning! And welcome to the BS we all knew was coming,"" the caption says. ""Trump is headed for a win, so six states just DECIDED TO STOP COUNTING in the wee hours for the first time in an election."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found dozens of similar claims using CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. (Screenshot from Facebook) As of 2:25 p.m. EST on Nov. 4, the Associated Press had called only Wisconsin in favor of Joe Biden, the Democratic challenger. None of the other states listed in the Facebook post had been decided. We reached out to the original poster for evidence to support their claim, but we didn’t hear back.  So we decided to take a closer look at whether the states cited in the Facebook post did stop counting ballots overnight on Nov. 3. The short answer is: They didn’t. Election officials in Fulton County, Ga., briefly paused counting ballots after a pipe burst at a facility in Atlanta. North Carolina stopped counting in-person votes once 100% of precincts were reported. But none of the states stopped counting votes altogether — and there’s no evidence they tried to swing the results in favor of Biden. In three states cited in the Facebook post — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — election officials were not allowed to start tabulating mail-in ballots until Election Day or just before. That resulted in reporting delays overnight on Nov. 3, since mail ballots take more time to count than in-person votes.  ""At no point has the counting process stopped since it began at 7 a.m. yesterday morning, which was when, per Michigan election law, it could begin,"" said Tracy Wimmer, director of media relations for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, referring to the morning of Nov. 3. We reached out to election officials in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, but we haven’t heard back. Archived election results pages for both states show that they continued to count ballots overnight on Nov. 3. The Trump campaign announced Nov. 4 that it was filing a lawsuit to halt the counting of votes in Michigan until it's granted ""meaningful access"" to observe the tabulation process. Election officials in Philadelphia County, a reliably Democratic part of Pennsylvania, told reporters Nov. 4 that they had counted about 141,000 mail-in ballots overnight, and that they still had more than 200,000 to go. As of 2:45 p.m. EST on Nov. 4, about 92% of precincts had reported their in-person votes, and about 41% of mail ballots were outstanding. Wisconsin officials said on the morning of Nov. 4 that they had counted all the ballots, and the AP called the state for Biden at 2:16 p.m. EST. The situation in the South is a bit different. Georgia allowed election officials to count mail-in ballots before Election Day, but the state faced delays nonetheless. In Fulton County, the state’s most populous county and home of Atlanta, absentee ballot counting was delayed by four hours after a burst water pipe caused flooding in State Farm Arena, where ballots were being processed. None of the ballots were damaged, but the incident put Fulton — a Democratic stronghold — behind in the vote-counting process. (As of 2:45 p.m. EST on Nov. 4, Fulton County was still counting ballots.) ""A small team of Fulton County Registration & Election workers continued to process absentee ballots overnight last night and a larger team began work at 8:30 a.m.,"" said Jessica Corbitt, director of external affairs for Fulton County. ""Last night, 74,000 absentee ballots were tabulated (and) included in results. There are approximately 42,400 (ballots that) will be opened, scanned and adjudicated today … Work will continue until completed."" The only state that stopped counting votes overnight on Nov. 3 was North Carolina — but that doesn’t mean it’s done counting votes, and the halt had nothing to do with Trump being ahead in the state. RELATED: Trump falsely and prematurely claims 2020 presidential victory ""North Carolina stopped counting votes on election night because there were no more votes to count at that time,"" said Patrick Gannon, public information director for the state Board of Elections.  In North Carolina, 100% of precincts have reported in-person votes, and the results show that Trump has a slight edge over Biden. But Gannon said county boards of election across the state will now begin counting provisional and absentee ballots that arrive by Nov. 12, as long as they’re postmarked by Election Day. ""Regardless of vote differentials, we never stop counting until all eligible votes are counted and added to the final results,"" he said. ""The person who you are fact-checking clearly doesn’t understand how elections work."" The delay in results does not indicate that anything is wrong — rather, it highlights the difficulty of holding an election during the coronavirus pandemic. ""Election results reporting may occur more slowly than prior years,"" says the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency on a ""rumor control"" page. ""This does not indicate there is any problem with the counting process or results.

NC GOP wrong about Roy Cooper staying in mansion
","Add North Carolina’s governor to the list of politicians accused of hiding from the public. During campaign season, Republicans on several occasions accused Democrats of hiding in their basements amid the coronavirus pandemic. That trend continued the Sunday after Christmas, when the North Carolina GOP tweeted about Gov. Roy Cooper. ""Democrat Governor @RoyCooperNC has not left the Governor's Mansion since the start of the #COVID19 crisis,"" the party tweeted on Dec. 27. Compared to similar claims and barbs, this particular tweet stood out. For one, North Carolina’s gubernatorial race is over. Incumbent Cooper defeated Republican Dan Forest by about 250,000 votes — or about 4 percentage points — over a month ago. Second, the North Carolina Republican Party’s claim is very specific.  So is it true that Cooper hasn’t left the Governor’s Mansion in Raleigh since March, when the pandemic started? No. There are numerous examples of Cooper leaving the executive mansion. On Dec. 21, less than a week before the NC GOP’s tweet, Cooper visited Duke Hospital to see health care workers receive COVID-19 vaccinations. He did the same at UNC Hospital in Chapel Hill on Dec. 17. Earlier this month, he toured a factory in Pittsboro that makes personal protective equipment. And in November, he toured a face shield production line. Cooper met with residents in August, when he visited Windsor in Bertie County after the town was hit by a tornado. He has held multiple press conferences about the coronavirus pandemic from the Emergency Management building across town from the executive mansion. Cooper also made a couple of high-profile appearances on the campaign trail in October, debating Forest at a studio in Research Triangle Park and greeting Joe Biden at RDU-International Airport. We know the NC GOP is aware of Cooper’s trip to the airport because it issued a press release about his conversation with Biden. The list of trips in this fact-check is not comprehensive. So why did the NC GOP tweet that Cooper hasn’t left his house? Party spokesman Tim Wigginton told PolitiFact NC that the tweet is not meant to be taken literally. ""The tweet is meant metaphorically,"" Wigginton said, adding that it’s meant to critique the frequency of Cooper’s visits with business owners. He accused Cooper of living ""in a bubble … instead of meeting with people devastated by his orders.""  The NC GOP’s tweet gave no indication that the party was calling on Cooper to meet with business owners. The NC GOP tweeted that Cooper ""has not left the Governor's Mansion since the start of the (COVID-19) crisis.""  That’s not only false, the party knows it’s false.

However, the firm cited in that version of the claim — Cerberus Capital Management — doesn’t own Dominion nor is it connected to Staple Street Capital, which acquired Dominion in 2018.  A public relations firm told the Associated Press on behalf of Dominion that the company ""has no connection to AT&T, the building, Nashville, family members of the Bidens or the Clintons, and Staple Street is not owned by Cerberus.

No, a recent study didn’t find that there was “no asymptomatic” spread of COVID-19
","Critics of policies to contain community spread of the coronavirus have taken to social media to tout a study they said showed no risk of asymptomatic individuals spreading the virus. This argument was shared on Twitter by Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, and was later amplified by Tomi Lahren, the conservative commentator and Fox Nation host, on both Twitter and Facebook.  Martin tweeted, ""Report: University of Florida researchers have found no asymptomatic or presymptomatic spread of Covid. The study was published online by the Journal of the American Medical Association. This could change everything."" Lahren shared Martin’s tweet, adding the comment, ""So ya mean locking down the country, destroying businesses, robbing students of real learning and shaming people into giving up our rights was not necessary?! Ya don’t say...."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So ya mean locking down the country, destroying businesses, robbing students of real learning and shaming people into giving up our rights was not necessary?! Ya don’t say.... https://t.co/xwUZtm5E85 Neither social media post provided a link to the study in question, but it appears to be a paper published on Dec. 14 in JAMA Network Open, an open-access medical journal published by the American Medical Association. The article was co-authored by four researchers from the University of Florida and two affiliated with the University of Washington. We reached out to several medical experts, including one of the co-authors, and they agreed that the portrayal of the journal article on social media ignored several caveats included in the article and made unjustified logical leaps. (Attempts to reach out to Martin and Lahren were unsuccessful.) The study was a ""meta-analysis"" — a paper that pools existing studies on a topic and tries to draw broader conclusions using a larger data set than any of the studies had individually.  Specifically, the study looked at how much the virus spread within households. The researchers found that among the studies that met their parameters, the ""secondary attack rates"" — that is, the likelihood of spread from an infected person to a previously uninfected person within a household — were higher among people who had symptoms than among those who didn’t: 18% for symptomatic individuals vs. 0.7% for asymptomatic individuals. The notion that people with symptoms are more likely to infect others is not a new one. Coughing, for example, is a symptom of COVID-19 and an especially effective way to spread the virus. One meta-analysis study published in September by researchers from Harvard University, Canada, Italy, Switzerland and the United Kingdom found that ""asymptomatic patients can transmit"" the virus to others, but that ""such individuals are responsible for fewer secondary infections than people with symptoms in the same studies."" Other studies have also shown reduced rates of transmission among asymptomatic individuals.  In other words, there’s consistent evidence that asymptomatic individuals are less likely to spread the virus than symptomatic individuals are. But the paper didn’t find the rate of spread to be zero. Moreover, Martin’s original tweet mischaracterized the paper’s conclusions, and Lahren’s comment exacerbated the misunderstanding.  Here are the two major fallacies, according to experts. Only four of the 54 studies analyzed in the paper even tracked asymptomatic spread, making it hard to draw detailed conclusions. The paper noted this twice, cautioning that ""less data were available"" on asymptomatic cases and that ""there were few studies"" involving asymptomatic individuals. The difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic spread was ""notable, but it was not meant to upend"" the broader understanding of the subject, said Natalie E. Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, and one of the co-authors of the paper. The paucity of data on asymptomatic spread is not surprising, experts said, since it requires a more extensive testing regimen, raising the cost and difficulty for researchers. Such studies ""would require repeated, complete-household testing to ascertain causality and the origin and timing of infections in the household,"" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious-disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health.  In fact, Nichols said, we simply don’t know enough yet to determine how commonly asymptomatic spread occurs. ""The four studies that the JAMA Open Network meta-analysis has reviewed had remarkably small sample sizes, and the studies were not designed to answer this specific question,"" Nichols said. The study in question looked only at spread within households. A household is a more limited environment that is easier to control and study than a full community. The study’s focus on households, rather than on community spread, is relevant because Lahren’s critique largely addresses policies that govern community interactions, such as restrictions on businesses, public gatherings and schools. The course of the spread in the United States makes clear that most transmission has been occurring at the community level, said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine, health policy and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. ""It is self-evident that here in the U.S. and in other countries, when we have let down our guard, that's been followed by an explosion of COVID transmission that results in people being put into hospitals and ICUs,"" Schaffner said. ""Countries such as Australia and New Zealand that have really instituted these interventions, including masking, social distancing, and controlling the size of groups, have controlled the spread better than any other countries."" In addition, the papers that have addressed community spread suggest that asymptomatic spread does occur.  Experts added that while one might think that transmission of the virus is more likely to occur in the enclosed spaces of a household, this ignores a key factor: Asymptomatic people will encounter many more people if they’re out and about while infected. ""If their viral loads are lower, but their contact rates are higher — the number of people a person sees in one day — then the likelihood of transmission could become similar,"" Nichols said. Facebook posts said a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association by University of Florida researchers has found no asymptomatic or presymptomatic spread of COVID. The journal article in question did find lower transmission rates from asymptomatic individuals compared with symptomatic individuals, though the rate was not zero, as the post said. The posts ignore that the paper itself warns that the number of studies looking at asymptomatic transmission is small. And the paper looks only at household transmission, not community spread. Asymptomatic people going about their lives in the community would encounter many more people than someone stuck at home, meaning they could still infect a sizable number of people.

Marco Rubio says Anthony Fauci lied about masks. Fauci didn’t.
","At 9:33 on the morning of Dec. 27, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted a verse from the Bible that urged people to rise above the faults they see in others. ""Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience,"" Rubio wrote. ""Forgiving one another if one has a grievance against another; as the Lord has forgiven you, so must you also do."" By 10:45 a.m., Rubio struck a different tone. ""Dr. Fauci lied about masks in March,"" Rubio tweeted. ""Dr. Fauci has been distorting the level of vaccination needed for herd immunity."" Dr. Fauci lied about masks in March Dr. Fauci has been distorting the level of vaccination needed for herd immunityIt isn’t just himMany in elite bubbles believe the American public doesn’t know “what’s good for them” so they need to be tricked into “doing the right thing” Lying involves the intent to deceive, and the claim that Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health, lied about masks is familiar ground for fact-checkers. It doesn’t hold up. We have looked at what Fauci has said at different points during the pandemic, and his guidance has changed. The question is: Why? Top government agencies such as the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shifted their policies on masks based on new findings about the novel coronavirus. It wasn’t until April 3 that the CDC urged everyone to wear one. Before then, the message on masks was primarily about preserving a limited supply for health care workers, who were at especially high risk of exposure. Rubio’s tweet specifically referred to what Fauci said in March. That month, Fauci gave two high-profile interviews. In the first one, which occurred days before the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, Fauci pushed back against the idea of everyone in the U.S. needing to wear masks. It is worth reading Fauci’s exact words from his March 8 interview on CBS's ""60 Minutes."": FAUCI: The masks are important for someone who's infected to prevent them from infecting someone else. Now, when you see people and look at the films in China and South Korea, whatever, and everybody's wearing a mask. Right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks. HOST: You're sure of this, because people are listening really closely to this.  FAUCI: Right. Now people should not be walk— there's no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And often there are unintended consequences. People keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.  HOST: And you can get some schmutz sort of staying inside there. FAUCI: Of course, but when you think ""masks,"" you should think of health care providers needing them and people who are ill. The people — when you look at the films of countries, and you see 85% of the people wearing masks, that's fine. That's fine. I'm not against it. If you want to do it, that's fine.  HOST: But it can lead to a shortage.  FAUCI: Exactly, that’s the point. It could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need it. Fauci’s critics have focused on his words ""there's no reason to be walking around with a mask."" But in the same interview, he also said that it was ""fine"" to wear a mask, although it wouldn’t offer perfect protection. And he said the main point was to preserve masks for those who were already ill and people providing care. On March 27, Fauci spoke to a San Francisco NBC affiliate. He said given the shortage of masks, the general public ranked last behind doctors and nurses, and people who are infected. ""When we say you don't need to wear a mask, what we're really saying is make sure you prioritize it first for the people who need the mask,"" Fauci said. ""In a perfect world, if you had all the masks you wanted, then you could get some degree of protection, but make sure you prioritize it well."" March was a pivotal month for understanding the disease. On March 1, the country had seen eight deaths. On March 31, the figure stood at more than 4,300. When public officials talked about masks, they were talking about high-quality, hospital grade masks. In February and March, when the spread of the virus was still limited in the U.S., the mask shortage was a top concern.  On March 2, the FDA and CDC were saying ""There is no added health benefit to the general American public to wear a respiratory protective device, such as an N95 respirator. The immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low."" On an emergency basis, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration relaxed the rules on the sort of masks hospitals could use, citing tight supplies of the high-grade masks. The shortage was nationwide, and became more acute as the virus spread. On March 23, a bipartisan group of physician lawmakers in Utah called on businesses to donate N95 masks for use by health workers. On March 29, President Donald Trump and the coronavirus task force briefed the press on steps underway to increase the supply of masks to doctors, nurses and all care providers. By this time, COVID-19s had spread widely across the country, and public-health officials were rethinking their guidance as they learned more about the transmission of the virus by asymptomatic carriers. On April 3, Trump announced, ""From recent studies, we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood. ""In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure,"" Trump said. ""I want to emphasize that the CDC is not recommending the use of medical-grade or surgical-grade masks, and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard."" We reached out to Rubio’s office and did not get a formal response, but his deputy chief of staff posted a non-responsive tweet. Rubio said that Fauci lied about masks in March. This is incorrect in several ways. Fauci did say, ""there is no reason to be walking around with a mask,"" but to call that lying takes Fauci’s words out of context. The country faced a shortage of high-quality masks, and Fauci also said in his interviews that masks should be preserved for sick people and health care workers. In addition, researchers did not know at the time that people without symptoms were spreading the virus. Once that was understood, wearing masks — even simple cloth masks — took on new importance for preventing community transmission. Lying means there was an intent to deceive. Fauci’s words in March about masks mirrored the widely held belief across government agencies at that time about the nature of the novel coronavirus and the best ways to control it.

Bogus analysis leads to ridiculous claim about Biden votes
","President Donald Trump and his allies have continued to flood social media with falsehoods about the Nov. 3 election, including that the number of votes cast exceeded the number of eligible voters by a massive amount. ""REVEALED: ‘Simple math’ shows Biden claims 13 million more votes than there were eligible voters who voted in 2020 election,"" stated a headline on The Gateway Pundit. Trump retweeted the Gateway Pundit story. That story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The ""simple math"" about Biden’s voters is wrong.  The Gateway Pundit cites a tweet by Bill Binney, who worked at the National Security Agency from 1965 to 2001. Binney cited a Washington Post story about historic voter turnout in the November election.  The Washington Post story said 66.2% of the voting-eligible population cast a vote. (The United States Elections Project calculates the eligible population by adjusting the voting-age population for non-citizens and ineligible felons, depending on state law.) While the Washington Post clearly cited the voting-eligible population, Binney and The Gateway Pundit instead looked up figures for the number of registered voters — even though not every American who is eligible to vote takes the steps to register.  Binney wrote that if there are 212 million registered voters and 66.2% voted, that means about 140 million voted. If Trump received 74 million votes, that leaves about 66 million for Biden, Binney wrote. Binney’s implication is that there is no way Biden actually received about 81 million votes. ""These numbers don’t add up to what we are being told. Lies and more Lies!"" Binney tweeted. Binney didn't explain why, under this theoretically flawed analysis, it couldn’t have been Trump who had erroneously received millions of votes. The Gateway Pundit added up the number of registered voters and applied the same math formula and reported numbers in the same ballpark as Binney. The writer concluded that if Trump won 74 million votes, that left 67.5 million remaining for Biden. That means ""13 million duplicate or made up ballots were created and counted for Biden!"" But just as Binney did, the Gateway Pundit is plugging in the wrong number — the number of registered voters — while the Washington Post cited the number of adults eligible to vote. The United States Elections Project found there were about 239.2 million eligible voters for the Nov. 3 election. Using that denominator and an approximately 66% turnout rate, it shows that about 158 million people voted for president.  The Gateway Pundit also declared that ""Biden committed fraud"" and stole the election by ""millions"" of votes, a ridiculous assertion that included no evidence to back it up. Claims of widespread fraud have been debunked by federal security officials, as well as state election officials, including in GOP-led states such as Georgia. Nationwide, judges tossed out dozens of lawsuits by Trump and his allies that attempted to overturn the election, for lack of evidence.  There is one more problem with the faulty claims by Binney and the Gateway Pundit — they rely on outdated data on registered voters. They cited World Population Review’s state-by-state tally of registered voters, but that website shows the number of voters in some states months before the Nov. 3 election. For example, for Florida it shows 14,065,627 voters as of Aug. 31. But the relevant number is how many voters were registered as of the registration deadline, Oct. 6, which was 14,441,869. A headline on The Gateway Pundit said, ""REVEALED: ‘Simple math’ shows Biden claims 13 million more votes than there were eligible voters who voted in 2020 election."" This isn’t a case of simple math; it's a case of flawed analysis. The Gateway Pundit conflated registered voters with eligible voters. The two are not the same. There is no evidence that Biden claimed 13 million more votes than was mathematically possible.  This statement rates Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2020/dec/23/facebook-posts/bogus-analysis-leads-ridiculous-claim-about-biden-/

Facebook posts wrongly say COVID-19 bill includes foreign aid, arts funding
","Shortly after lawmakers agreed on sending $600 stimulus checks to many Americans, Facebook users said the COVID-19 relief bill put foreign interests and the arts above the needs of the American people. ""Every American left and right should be calling for a #VETO of this stimulus ‘deal’— which provides MORE funding to foreign governments and to American arts centers, than to the American people,"" said a Dec. 21 post.  The post included a picture listing domestic entities and foreign countries appropriated millions if not billions of dollars, juxtaposed with just $600 for the ""American people."" Under domestic funding, for instance, it listed the ""Kennedy Center — $26,400,000."" The post mentioned at least eight foreign countries receiving aid, including Egypt, Sudan, and Ukraine. According to the post, Egypt would get $1.3 billion. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post is right that Congress appropriated funds for foreign aid and for American arts centers, and Americans are free to disagree that taxpayer money is allotted in this way. But it’s wrong to suggest that such funding is in the COVID-19 relief bill. On Dec. 21, lawmakers in both chambers of Congress passed a $2.3 trillion spending package: a roughly $1.4 trillion omnibus spending bill — consisting of 12 different bills to fund the government during fiscal year 2021 — and a separate, approximately $900 billion bill specifically for COVID-19 relief. Lawmakers also passed several other smaller bills. It’s the $1.4 trillion part of the package that included funding for U.S. policies and priorities within the country and abroad. The Facebook post conflates provisions of the COVID-19 relief bill with provisions in the omnibus spending bill. It’s been about nine months since a $2 trillion COVID-19 relief bill was signed into law by President Donald Trump. Some members of Congress were frustrated that legislative leaders released the new bill — 5,593 pages long — just hours before they were expected to vote on it. Some people argue that Americans should be getting more than $600 in direct payments, and the Facebook posts echo that sentiment. At the same time, the posts don’t mention the other forms of relief that will be available to some Americans, including unemployment assistance. Overall, the COVID-19 relief bill totals more than $900 billion. Americans who meet specific income criteria are expected to get $600. The relief bill includes about $166 billion for the stimulus checks, according to a breakdown from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget: Here’s the group’s breakdown of what else is in the bill:  • $325 billion in aid to small businesses (includes Paycheck Protection Program) • $120 billion for unemployment assistance ($300 a week for 11 weeks) • $82 billion for education (such as K-12 education grants) • $56 billion for health care (includes funding for states to do COVID-19 testing) • $45 billion for transportation (includes payroll support program for airline workers) • $83 billion for other spending (such as rental assistance, nutrition programs) • $40 billion for other tax cuts (such as the Extend and Expand Employee Retention Tax Credit) The Facebook post says that lawmakers provided aid to at least eight foreign countries in the COVID-19 relief package, including $1.3 billion to Egypt. That’s not part of the COVID-19 relief bill. The omnibus spending bill, under the header ""Foreign Military Financing program,"" says that $1.3 billion is to remain available until Sept. 30, 2022, and should be made available for assistance for Egypt.  It stipulates several conditions for the disbursement of those funds. For instance, $225 million will be withheld until the secretary of state certifies and reports to Congress that the Egyptian government has taken steps to improve the rule of law, democratic institutions, and human rights. Appropriation bills usually include foreign aid, commonly for military and humanitarian aid, said Steve Ellis, president of the nonpartisan budget watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. Our reporting has shown that foreign aid historically represents about 1% of the overall federal budget. Polling has shown that average Americans assume the U.S. spends about 31% of its budget on foreign aid.  The omnibus spending part of the package passed by Congress also calls for $26.4 million to remain available until Sept. 30, 2022 for the John F. Kennedy Center’s operation, maintenance, and security. The Facebook post flags that appropriation, but omits that it’s part of the omnibus spending bill, not part of the COVID-19 relief bill. The ""domestic funding"" and ""foreign countries"" funding in the post are part of the omnibus spending bill, not the COVID-19 relief bill. The total of the ""foreign aid"" and ""domestic funding"" mentioned in the Facebook post is not greater than the funding in the COVID-19 relief bill. Other Facebook posts also claimed, wrongly, that Congress snuck a pay raise for its members into the new legislation. It did not. The same claim was made about the CARES Act in March. As we’ve reported, congressional pay raises are fixed to the Employment Cost Index, which measures changes in wages. Pay increases are automatic unless Congress votes them down, which it has done repeatedly since 2009, according to the Congressional Research Service. Section 7 of the legislation says: ""Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no adjustment shall be made under section 601(a) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (2 U.S.C. 4501) (relating to cost of living adjustments for Members of Congress) during fiscal year 2021.""  A Facebook post claimed that a COVID-19 relief bill ""provides more funding to foreign governments and to American arts centers, than to the American people."" The post conflates provisions of the $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill with provisions of a separate, $1.4 trillion omnibus spending bill. Both were part of a broader $2.3 trillion package approved by Congress.  The overall spending bill included funding for American arts centers and foreign aid, but that funding was not included in the COVID-19 relief bill. It was part of the $1.4 trillion omnibus spending bill. The Facebook post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.  We rate it Mostly False.

Viral tweet cites made-up CDC ‘COVID-19 survival rates’ to downplay vaccine
","As the U.S. continues to distribute the first COVID-19 vaccines, a viral tweet shared what it said were ""COVID-19 survival rates"" from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to downplay the severity of the virus and the need for vaccinations. ""CDC COVID-19 Survival Rates,"" said the emoji-filled tweet from Emma Jimenez, a conservative blogger and activist. ""Age 0-19 — 99.997%. Age 20-49 — 99.98%. Age 50-69 — 99.5%. Age 70+ — 94.6%.

Screenshots of the tweet were also shared on Facebook and Instagram, where they were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)   A screenshot of a viral tweet shared to Facebook that wrongly claimed to show the CDC's COVID-19 survival rates. The age-specific ""survival rates"" listed in the post did not come from the CDC, however. CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed told PolitiFact that the agency has not released any age-specific COVID-19 survival rates, nor does it have mortality rates available. ""Survival analysis is highly complex,"" Reed said. ""CDC does not have the data to calculate survivability for COVID-19. Unclear as to where social media users are getting this information."" ""We don’t have that data, so we don’t know,"" added Cindy Prins, an epidemiologist at the University of Florida. ""And neither would the person who posted (the tweet)."" The tweet didn’t cite a specific CDC source for its ""COVID-19 survival rates."" PolitiFact tried to reach Jimenez through messages to her Conservative Latina Twitter and Facebook accounts, but we did not hear back. The figures line up with parameters included as part of CDC planning scenarios designed to help public health agencies model the impact of the pandemic.  In a September document labeled ""COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios,"" the agency listed five sets of parameters that represented different levels of disease severity and transmissibility, with the goal of helping public health agencies make models to estimate the effects of the virus. The infection fatality rates listed under the scenario marked as the ""current best estimate"" correspond with the ""survival rates"" listed in the tweet. But those infection fatality rates, the document says, are based on data through Aug. 8. And there are other caveats. Lead Stories debunked a Facebook post citing the same scenarios to wrongly claim that the CDC had downgraded the severity of COVID-19 to something less than the flu.  The CDC document says the scenarios ""are not predictions of the expected effects of COVID-19"" and ""do not reflect the impact of any behavioral changes, social distancing, or other interventions."" It also says ""uncertainty remains around nearly all parameter values."" The tweet also ignored the toll a seemingly small fatality rate can take when a disease spreads unchecked. Johns Hopkins University puts the observed case fatality ratio — calculated as the number of known deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases — at about 1.8% for the U.S. At that rate, if every American got COVID-19, there would be almost 6 million deaths. Doctors have gotten better at treating the disease since the outbreak of the pandemic, PolitiFact reported. But the numbers of new COVID-19 cases and deaths reported each day in the U.S. have skyrocketed in recent weeks. ""Excess deaths"" remain above historical norms. The risk of severe illness from the coronavirus increases with age, the CDC says.  In a pandemic, it’s difficult to nail down data points like survival rates, Prins told PolitiFact. Such rates are usually calculated for a longer period of time rather than as a snapshot. ""Deaths and reporting of deaths lag behind the identification of new cases, sometimes for months, so we never quite catch up with knowing who has ‘survived’ unless we set a time period that we’re looking at, like we do with five-year survival rates in cancers, or the disease goes away and we can look back at the pandemic as a whole,"" Prins said. ""In addition, we know that there are side effects of COVID-19 like myocarditis that may show up well after ‘recovery’ but could cause death at that later time, so both survival rates and mortality rates are more accurate after some time has passed."" A widespread vaccination effort would prevent more deaths, protect people from severe illness, slow the spread and put the U.S. on a path back to normal. A tweet said ""CDC COVID-19 survival rates"" are 99.997% for people ages 0 to 19, 99.98% for people ages 20 to 49, 99.5% for people ages 50 to 69, and 94.6% for people over 70. The CDC has not released survival rates, and it doesn’t have the data to do so. It’s not clear where the tweet’s numbers came from, but they correspond with figures listed as part of CDC ""planning scenarios"" used for planning a pandemic response.

Examining Texas' oil and gas industry amid pandemic
","Texas’ oil and gas sector took a tumble in 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic was compounded by a Saudi Arabia-Russia price war that further devastated the global oil market.  In May, two weeks after crude oil prices turned negative for the first time in history, Texas Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick spoke with the Texas Tribune giving updates on how the industry was handling the downturn. ""Last year, [oil and gas] was about 35% of the state's economy ... and so [because this industry] is down ... it's gonna affect everything,"" Craddick said. Craddick repeated that same figure in a tweet earlier this month as she advocated for prioritization of the Railroad Commission — the state’s oil and gas regulatory agency — in next year’s state budget.  ""Oil and gas is 35 percent of the state economy, making the (Texas Railroad Commission’s) budget an important priority,"" she said. Texas oil and gas producers have suffered the double blow of COVID-19 and the global price shock amid an era when the industry is facing a process of structural contraction. Oil and gas has long been a primary driver of Texas’ prosperity, but does its share of the state economy remain at 35% even after a historically tumultuous year? Determining the oil and gas’ industry’s share of the state economy ""is a hard number to pin down,"" said Jesse Thompson, senior business economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. There’s a multitude of ways an industry’s economic impact can be measured, Thompson said. Impact could be an industry’s share of a state’s gross state product, or the number of jobs it creates, or the amount of income it generates, or some combination of the three.  Furthermore, there are three different levels upon which economists analyze economic impact: an industry’s direct, indirect and induced effects on the economy. Direct effects include the revenue generated by oil and gas companies; indirect effects include the businesses supplying equipment or services to those oil and gas companies; and induced effects include the spending of people in the industry as a result of increased personal income.  For example, induced impacts could include an interior decorator in Houston who is hired by an oil and gas employee. ""There’s a lot of very reasonable ways to break this up, that’s why there’s not necessarily a right answer,"" Thompson said. Direct impacts are the most straightforward measurement. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a federal agency, the oil and gas sector directly comprised around 15% of the state’s gross state product between 2019 and early 2020. That share fell to around 14.2% as the coronavirus swept the globe and forced the industry to shed jobs and shut down drilling rigs in the second quarter of 2020, the latest period for which economic data is available. According to Craddick’s spokesperson, the 35% figure Craddick cited represents the oil and gas sector’s direct impacts to the gross state product combined with its indirect and induced impacts. The 35% figure is also a projection for how the year will end after the industry’s bounce back from its April nadir.  ""We have seen improvements throughout the remainder of the year, so the number is definitely going to land somewhere between 30% and 40%, so 35% was an easy middle point,"" said Craddick’s Director of Public Affairs Mia Hutchens.  Certain indicators are already showing the sector’s recovery. The Texas rig count has shown a slight uptick since October corresponding with an improving global demand for oil and natural gas. After nearly 60,000 oil workers lost their jobs between February and August, around 2,100 jobs were added in September and October, according to the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association. The association also projects that, by year's end, the industry will be supporting at least 300,000 direct jobs and 2.1 million indirect jobs in Texas. The 35% projection was calculated using data from the Texas comptrollers office, the Texas Pipeline Association and the Texas Oil and Gas Association, the sector’s largest industry group in the state, according to Hutchens.  At the beginning of 2020, before COVID-19 had reached all corners of the globe, the Texas Oil and Gas Association pegged the industry’s share of Texas’ gross state product at 30.5%. According to a spokesperson, the trade group determined that number by finding the sum of the industry’s direct contributions to Texas’ gross state product — $223.1 billion, or about 13.5% of the state economy.  Then, to capture the industry’s indirect and induced ""ripple"" effects, the Oil and Gas Association multiplied the industry’s direct gross state product by 2.3, meaning that every dollar spent in the industry was modeled to generate $2.30 in spin-off economic activity. This multiplier produces an estimated $502.6 billion of economic impact in the state, or 30.5% of the private sector’s gross state product. To Karr Ingham, a petroleum economist with the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers, the association's method of calculation using a multiplier of 2.3 is ""pretty close to correct."" ""That’s not high. If anything that could be a touch low,"" Ingham said. ""I’ve heard commissioners in the past and other political types and other industry cheerleaders say the multiplier for oil and gas is 7."" Before the pandemic, Texas producers were coming off a couple of down years in 2018 and 2019. In 2018, about four years after the global oil prices collapsed and slammed the brakes on Texas’ fracking boom, the industry was hampered by a credit crunch as lackluster oil prices remained volatile. By mid-2019, oil jobs were in decline as companies struggled to provide steady income and growth. ""It’s been the worst-performing sector on the S&P for the last couple years,"" said Bill Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. ""If you take the value of all the producers and add them together, by 2019 they collectively were worth less than Apple."" According to Gilmer, there are ""at least three tough quarters in front of us"" before the industry will begin to reassert itself and shake off lasting effects of the pandemic.  ""By the time we get to 2022 — and it will take that long for us to feel really good about the economy — oil and the U.S. economy will be back,"" Gilmer said. Craddick’s 35% figure reflects the commissioner’s belief that the industry will begin next year stronger than it began 2020. Although several indicators point to an upward trajectory of the industry — like oil prices, jobs, and rig count — Karr said the 35% projection may be slightly optimistic.  ""It’s a little hard to take issue with [Craddick’s number] just because it’s guesswork,"" Karr said. Craddick said earlier this month that the oil and gas industry comprises 35% of the Texas economy. Craddick's office clarified that this figure represented the industry’s combined direct, indirect and induced economic impact, and that it represents a projection of how the industry will end the year after its recent bounce back.  The oil and gas industry has comprised as much as 40% of the state economy during the last decade’s fracking boom, yet shrunk to 30% before the pandemic shocked the world economy. Firm quarterly data showing the industry’s recent gains will not be released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis until late 2021. We rate this claim Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2020/dec/22/christi-craddick/examining-texas-oil-and-gas-industry-amid-pandemic/

No, dead people did not vote in NY-22
","The winner in a razor-thin congressional election in the Binghamton area still hasn’t been determined, and in the weeks since Election Day with controversies over which ballots to count, Republican candidate Claudia Tenney's campaign has warned of ""utter dysfunction.""  On Twitter earlier this month, Tenney retweeted this claim by a group of House Republicans: ""They’re literally finding ballots in random desk drawers in New York. That doesn’t sound fishy at all."" Tenney added: ""Dead people also voted. Ballots sent from NYC in the count as well.""  Dead people also voted. Ballots sent from NYC in the count as well. https://t.co/NnEE8XsI9g Tenney, seeking a seat she once held, has talked about ""dead"" or ""deceased"" people voting in other forums as well, including in a statement from her campaign in November and in an interview with Fox News this month. As of Dec. 18, Tenney held a 19-vote lead over Democratic incumbent Anthony Brindisi, 155,519 to 155,500, according to unofficial returns from the eight counties in the district. Since this race is attracting so much attention, we wondered if there is any truth to her claim.  Tenney hasn’t been the only person talking about dead people voting in the 22nd Congressional District, which stretches between the shore of Lake Ontario, Utica and the Pennsylvania border. The New York Post, on Nov. 23, published a story headlined: ""Ballots cast by the dead emerge in extremely tight Brindisi-Tenney race."" The story cited information from a Madison County lawyer, who told the court overseeing the ballot counting that three ballots in that county were disregarded after they were submitted to the Board of Elections, because the voters were ""deceased.""  Mary Egger, the Republican elections commissioner in Madison County, told PolitiFact the board discovered three people who voted with absentee ballots died before Election Day, and that those ballots were taken out of the count.  The Democratic commissioner, Laura Costello, confirmed this.  ""Before counting our absentees we check for purged voters and pulled these absentees out of the count,"" Costello said. In New York state, paper ballots that are submitted early to the Board of Elections are not counted if a board discovers that the voter died before Election Day, according to state Board of Elections Director of Public Information John Conklin. ""This is a common occurrence,"" Conklin said.  Madison County uses a state registry to determine whether any of the registered voters who voted early died before Election Day.  ""It is not uncommon,"" Egger said. ""It’s something we check every election, and it does happen."" Madison County did not have a case of anyone trying to vote by impersonating a dead person. 
There could have been cases where someone voted early on a voting machine in a polling place, and then died before Election Day. Those ballots are still counted, Egger said.  We reached out to election commissioners in all of the 22nd Congressional District’s eight counties. Half of the counties responded, and they said they were not aware of any person who tried to impersonate a dead person in order to vote.  In Chenango County, some ballots were returned to the board because the voter had died, said Commissioner Carol Franklin. This happens because people who are on a list to receive an absentee ballot for every election because they have a disability and then die are not promptly removed from the list. There were no instances of someone impersonating a dead person, Franklin said.  Cortland County pulled six ballots after they were cast because the voters died before Election Day, said Commissioner Robert Howe. In Tioga County, Commissioner James Wahls said they had no known instances where a voter cast an absentee ballot and died before Election Day.  After Tenney made her claim on Twitter, ballots were under review in Madison County. 
The Brindisi campaign requested that one of the three ballots the Board of Elections had set aside be considered, unless a death certificate or confirmation of death from an official source could be produced, said Egger, the Republican commissioner. The board was relying on a newspaper obituary to confirm the death, she said. A spokesman for Brindisi, Luke Jackson, confirmed Egger’s story.   The Tenney campaign is also asking that two other ballots be set aside because they believe the voters died before Election Day, Egger said, adding that the Board of Elections cannot establish that these voters died.  
 
These and other questions about which ballots should be counted are under review in State Supreme Court.  Registered voters who vote by absentee ballot and die before Election Day is not an instance of fraud, said Sean Morales-Doyle, who studies elections and is a deputy director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center.  ""I think the fact that an election official catches the fact that someone died after they cast their ballot but before Election Day is a sign the system is working,"" he said.  In a decision and order on Dec. 8, State Supreme Court Justice Scott DelConte wrote: ""To be clear, there is absolutely no evidence -- or even an allegation -- before this Court of any fraud on the part of the Boards or the campaigns.""  The Tenney campaign said that absentee ballots overwhelmed boards of election, and provided to PolitiFact photos of ballots that were sent to people who had died, and obituaries to corroborate their deaths. These ballots were not filled out by anyone.  The number of absentee ballots ""made it extremely difficult for officials to verify that every ballot was properly cast by a legal (and living) voter,"" said Sean Kennedy, spokesman for the Tenney campaign.  ""In this election, multiple ballots were cast by people who were deceased on Election Day,"" Kennedy said. ""Due to insufficient safeguards and the massive volume of mail-in ballots to process, we do not know how many more went undetected and are considered valid votes. Fortunately, the local boards excluded those votes but unfortunately our opponent has now asked that a dead voter’s ballot be counted."" Tenney wrote ""Dead people also voted"" when retweeting a claim implying that something ""fishy"" is going on in ballot-counting in New York.  It is accurate that living people cast ballots and died before Election Day, according to several election commissioners across the district’s eight counties. Ballots from these known individuals are not part of a board’s vote tally.  In the case of a single ballot in Madison County set aside because election officials found an obituary causing them to believe the voter died, Brindisi’s campaign is asking that a death certificate be produced before that ballot is disregarded from the count. It will be up to the court to decide whether to count that ballot.  It is possible that boards of election do not catch every instance of a voter dying after they cast their ballot but before Election Day. In addition, voters who vote early on machines at polling places and die before Election Day have their votes counted. It’s unclear how often this happened in this race, if it happened at all.   But Tenney offers no proof that anyone used the identities of dead people to cast fraudulent votes, or that ballots cast by voters who died before Election Day are included in the tally. Photos of unfilled ballots are not evidence of voter fraud. The court is dealing with other problems related to timely and accurate ballot counting. Dead people voting isn't one of them.  We rate Tenney’s claim Pants on Fire!

Anti-vaccine video of fainting nurse lacks context
","A nearly 18-minute Facebook video seeks to foment doubts about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines by highlighting the case of a Tennessee nurse who became dizzy and fell to the ground after vaccination. The video omits important context: the nurse has a medical history of becoming dizzy even after minimal pain. ""Nurse passes out on live TV after taking vaccine,"" says the caption for the video posted Dec. 18. In the video, Dr. Taylor Marshall, who describes himself as a theologian, philosopher, author, and father of eight children, tells his viewers: ""So there it is. It’s sad. Now, what do we make of this? Why are all these people making publicity moments over taking a vaccine? This shows that from the beginning, from the beginning this whole thing has political and social motives."" Marshall later in the video says one has to be humble about the potential effects of new drugs and new vaccines in general. ""There is a Frankenstein effect potential, we just don't know what will be the outcome,"" he says. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A nurse at CHI Memorial in Chattanooga, Tenn., did become dizzy after taking a COVID-19 vaccine, and it happened during a live media interview. ""I’m sorry I’m feeling really dizzy,"" Tiffany Dover, the nurse, suddenly says in the video. She raises her left hand to her head and says ""I’m sorry,"" one more time. A man near her then holds her hand as she falls to the ground. Doctors quickly surround her. CHI Memorial explained what happened in a Dec. 18 tweet: The hospital said that the nurse became dizzy and was assisted to the floor, but never lost consciousness and quickly recovered. CHI Memorial said that in another media interview, after recovering, the nurse said she had a history of an overactive vagal response, and that she passes out if she has pain from anything. Fainting can happen after many types of vaccines, CHI Memorial said, citing the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""The fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine,"" Dr. Jesse L. Tucker, a CHI Memorial critical care physician said in a media interview after the incident. The nurse’s reaction was related to her known medical condition, he said. In a video posted on Twitter by CHI Memorial, Dover said that a hangnail or stubbing her toe can also cause her to pass out. She said she felt fine and that the pain in her arm from the shot was ""very minimal, actually, but it doesn’t take much,"" for her to pass out. She added that she’s probably passed out six times in the past six weeks. ""It’s common for me,"" she says. Dover said she did not regret taking the COVID-19 vaccine. In follow-up tweets Dec. 19 and Dec. 21, CHI Memorial said Dover was doing well. A Facebook post claimed, ""Nurse passes out on live TV after taking vaccine."" A nurse in Tennessee did become dizzy and was assisted to the ground after taking a COVID-19 vaccine. But the nurse later said that her dizziness is something that regularly happens to her after experiencing any kind of pain, even after stubbing a toe. The nurse recovered and said she was feeling fine.

Viral photo, flight logs don't prove Chief Justice John Roberts went to Jeffrey Epstein’s island
","There’s no evidence that U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts was photographed on Jeffrey Epstein’s private island, despite what some social media users claim.  A related narrative claims Roberts was listed in Epstein’s flight logs, but it also lacks evidence. The claims falsely connecting Roberts to Epstein, the billionaire who was accused of running a sex trafficking ring before he died in jail, have picked up as supporters of President Donald Trump attack the Supreme Court for rejecting a bid to overturn the election in his favor. Attorney Lin Wood, who has pushed unfounded claims of voter fraud and has hashtags related to the QAnon conspiracy theory in his Twitter bio, suggested in one of several Dec. 17 tweets that the chief justice was listed on Epstein’s flight logs. Social media users quickly followed suit. ""Lin Wood confirms Chief Justice John Roberts was on Epstein’s pedo island, has documentation"" said the headline on one pro-Trump blog post shared widely on Facebook.

Contrary to global experts, Bob Good says the pandemic is 'phony'
","Virginia Rep.-elect Bob Good got cheers at a rally for President Donald Trump when he told the crowd the novel coronavirus pandemic is a farce. ""This looks like a group of people that gets this is a phony pandemic,"" Good, R-5th Congressional District, said Dec. 12 at a Women for America First rally in Washington. ""It’s a serious virus, but it’s a virus; it’s not a pandemic."" COVID-19 is not a pandemic? Let’s check. The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines pandemic as ""an outbreak of a disease that occurs over a wide geographic area (such as multiple countries or continents) and typically affects a significant proportion of the population: a pandemic outbreak of a disease."" COVID-19 has struck all continents except Antarctica. As of Dec. 21, there have 77 million cases across the globe, and 1.7 million deaths. Does that qualify as affecting ""a significant portion of the population,"" as the definition requires?  Merriam-Webster has no doubt; it cites COVID-19 as an example of a pandemic. Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was appalled by Good’s statement. ""Of course it's a pandemic,"" told CNN on Dec. 16. ""There's a definition of a pandemic and that is a virus that is raging across the world, and this clearly is doing that. We have hundreds of thousands of dead Americans, we'll have millions of people around the world. This is not phony; this is not fake. It is serious."" Giroir said he’d be happy to provide Good with ""technical assistance"" to understand the pandemic. We ran a quick search of 10 science and health authorities around the world and found each one describes COVID-19 as a pandemic. They are: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; World Health Organization;  American Journal of Managed Care (AJMC); U.S. Food and Drug Administration;   JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association);  National Institutes of Health; The World Bank;  United Nations;  BMJ (British Medical Journal); and Indian Journal of Medical Research. Good, a self-described ""biblical conservative,"" is a former banker, wrestling coach and athletic fundraiser at Liberty University. More than 300 people have died of COVID-19 in the district he’ll represent, according to The Washington Post. We asked his spokesperson, Courtney Heath, for an explanation of Good’s statement, but didn’t hear back. The day after his statement, Good posted a series of tweets deriding ""government lockdowns and excessive restrictions'' enacted to contain the virus. He compared the risk of dying from COVID to that of dying in an automobile accident.  He noted that 5% of Americans have contracted the virus, one-tenth of 1% have died from it, and vaccines will become increasingly available.  ""We have got to stop the insanity, and stop accepting the hoax that says forcing people to wear a mask, forcing businesses to close, prohibiting worship services, and keeping kids out of school will make a significant difference in whether or not we will die from this virus,"" he wrote. Our ruling Good said the novel coronavirus is a ""phony pandemic"". COVID-19 has spread through every continent except Antarctica, racking 77 million cases and 1.7 million deaths.

Yes, a majority of Wisconsin jurisdictions support nonpartisan redistricting
","When Republicans won the Legislature and governor’s office in 2010, the party was in the driver’s seat for a vital function: Redrawing district maps to account for population changes. Those maps led to a range of lawsuits -- which generally failed -- accusing the GOP of unfairly gerrymandering districts to give the party an unfair advantage at the polls.  Ten years later, as we approach another round of redistricting, the political landscape has changed, in that Democrat Tony Evers now holds the governor’s office. Has it changed more than that? State Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) claimed in a Nov. 9, 2020 tweet that jurisdictions representing about 80% of Wisconsin residents have passed resolutions or referendums in support of fair maps.  ""All told, jurisdictions representing about 80% of WI residents have passed referendums or resolutions in favor of fair maps,"" he wrote in the tweet. ""Gerrymandering is an affront to our Democracy, and I will continue to fight for WI leg. maps that reflect the will of the people, not the party in power.""  Is he right? In 2011, maps were drawn behind closed doors. Republican lawmakers and their aides were required to sign nondisclosure agreements in order to look at maps of their own proposed districts before the public could see them.  The maps prompted a swirl of lawsuits, with Democrats alleging that Assembly districts had been unconstitutionally gerrymandered to give Republicans an advantage. In the end, Democrats ended up dropping the gerrymandering case, according to a June 2019 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that federal courts can’t consider allegations that partisans drew election maps to favor themselves.  During the decade, Democrats won back only three Assembly seats, including two during the 2020 elections, according to a Nov. 3, 2020 Journal Sentinel article, and one in 2018, according to an Oct. 29, 2020 PolitiFact report.  Evers, elected in 2018, has called for a nonpartisan commission to look at Census data and draw fair maps. He included the proposal in his first budget, but it was denied. Instead, he created the panel by executive order in 2019, according to a July 2020 article from the Journal Sentinel. His panel bars party officials, lawmakers and former lobbyists from joining it.  In practice, it’s unclear what that will mean in 2021. Republicans in the Legislature have not signed onto the commission idea, so they may pursue maps of their own -- though this time they would need support from Evers, instead of former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican. If the two sides deadlock, the matter would end up in front of a judge. In addition to the action by Evers, various local government bodies have been going on the record in support of ""fair maps."" They range from Lincoln County to Milwaukee County.  The wording varies, but generally speaking they ask for the creation of nonpartisan procedure for the preparation of legislative and congressional redistricting plans to increase accountability and transparency.  These referendums are at the center of Larson’s claim. When asked for evidence to back Larson’s claim, aide Justin Bielinski noted the senator wasn’t the only one to cite the 80% number -- that Gov. Tony Evers had even done so in the announcement of the People’s Maps Commission. Bielinski also cited information from the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign.  According to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonprofit, non-partisan government watchdog group that has tracked gerrymandering, 55 counties have passed either resolutions, referendums or both. Referendums are voted on directly by residents, while resolutions are voted on by county boards.  The population of those counties adds up to 4.8 million people, according to the group. The state has about 5.8 million residents, based on the latest census data. Thus, those numbers mean nearly 83% of Wisconsinites are represented by jurisdictions who have signaled support for fair maps.  Larson said ""jurisdictions representing 80% of Wisconsin residents"" passed referendums or resolutions ""in favor of fair maps.""  According to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, jurisdictions representing about 82% of Wisconsin’s population have approved either a referendum, resolution or both in support of fair maps.  We rate this claim True.  ",/factchecks/2020/dec/21/chris-larson/yes-majority-wisconsin-jurisdictions-support-nonpa/

Data shows in-person learning safer than expected, not driving case spikes
","The ideological split on in-person schooling during the pandemic was pretty predictable through most of 2020. Those who generally favored lockdowns and other strong mitigation measures opposed in-person schooling, while those who derided lockdowns, mask orders and the like typically supported it. Like much related to COVID-19, however, positions have shifted on this issue as more data and studies have emerged. One prominent Wisconsin Republican says that research now supports a more widescale return to the classroom. ""It's time to get kids back in school,"" U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Green Bay, said in a Dec. 7, 2020, tweet. ""New data shows in-person learning isn't driving spikes in cases, and school closures leave us with the worst of both worlds: students falling further behind without a significant impact on slowing the spread."" Is Gallagher right that in-person learning isn’t driving a spike in cases? In a word: Yes. The push against virtual schooling — embraced by most school districts starting in March — has strengthened as a growing body of research shows the toll being out of the classroom takes on learning. In fall 2020 assessments, students in grades 3 to 8 performed similarly to same-grade students last year in reading, but 5 to 10 percentage points lower in math, according to a November report from NWEA, a research-based nonprofit group that assessed 4.4 million students. A November report from Renaissance Learning Inc. similarly found students falling behind in math, with some grades 12 weeks or more behind. The move online has in many cases worsened existing socioeconomic achievement gaps as well, since online learning works only when students have consistent internet access and home support, according to research compiled by the Economic Policy Institute and others. Meanwhile, the science shows school doesn’t present the risk many experts expected. As with many other pandemic response measures, the diversity of local guidelines governing schools has created a natural experiment. ""Children and schools are not the main drivers of the epidemic across countries,"" said a UNICEF report published in November. ""Evidence shows that the net benefits of keeping schools open outweigh the costs of closing them. Data from 191 countries show no consistent association between school reopening status and COVID-19 infection rates."" An international research report out of Spain found a similar lack of correlation, as did a study by Insights for Education that said there is ""no consistent pattern between school status and infection levels."" Even Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is now advocating for a measured return to in-class instruction. ""The default position should be to try as best as possible within reason to keep the children in school, or to get them back to school,"" he said on ABC’s ""This Week"" on Nov. 29, 2020. ""If you look at the data, the spread among children and from children is not really very big at all, not like one would have suspected. So, let's try to get the kids back, but let's try to mitigate the things that maintain and just push … community spread"" like capacity seating indoors at restaurants and bars. One project run by Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University, has gathered data from 13 million in-person students (some multiple times) since September, in partnership with schools around the U.S. That data showed an infection rate of 2.2 students per 1,000 over a two-week period. The staff infection rate over that span was 4.2 per 1,000. (Wisconsin was notably worse in both categories, averaging 7 infections per 1,000 students and 19 per 1,000 staff members) ""The numbers are small — smaller than what many had forecasted,"" Oster wrote in an Atlantic article detailing her early findings in October. CDC data shows children under age 18 make up about 10% of cases in the U.S., though they comprise 22% of the total population. (Children account for just 0.1% of deaths.) The key asterisk is that in-person instruction is safest when mitigation measures remain in place in both schools and the community. The CDC recommends use of masks and following other guidelines such as social distancing, washing hands, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces in schools and buses. PolitiFact Missouri noted this in rating Mostly True a claim that schools using these strategies ""remain among the safest places for our students."" Jordan Dunn, press secretary for Gallagher, cited this research and Fauci’s comments in defending Gallagher’s statement. ""That’s not to say there isn’t transmission in schools and schools should re-open without common sense safety measures,"" Dunn said in an email. ""But the data that has been collected suggests, as Rep. Gallagher states, that in-person learning is not driving spikes in cases and schools are not super-spreaders."" Gallagher said, ""New data shows in-person learning isn't driving spikes in cases."" Indeed, research from an array of sources in October and November show in-person instruction has not been tied to increased cases in those areas. Key leaders including Fauci have acknowledged classroom instruction caused fewer issues than expected, leading him to support a shift away from virtual learning.
