Gov.-elect John Kasich correct that nearly half Ohio's inmates are low-level offenders, many serving less than a year
","
Gov-elect John Kasich, who will inherit the state’s budget hole next month, has not said how he plans to fill it. But he continues to reiterate that every idea is on the table – except tax increases – and he’s been fielding questions from reporters about various options and proposals.

Speaking to a gaggle of reporters on Dec. 3, Kasich was asked to comment on the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction’s earlier warning that it would have to close prisons and release some inmates to meet a 10 percent budget cut if such a reduction is required.

Kasich, who’s is considering privatizing some aspects of the prison system and other state operations, reacted with his typical candor, glibness and hint of exasperation.

""Well, look, this is just ‘rally around the flag,’ boys, right?,"" he said. ""You are going to have everybody complaining and screaming that the skies are falling.""

He suggested that ""instead of people whining,"" the ODRC should offer some ideas about reducing costs. ""I guess the system is just great over at the department of corrections,"" he said sarcastically.

Addressing the substance of the question more directly, Kasich offered this:

""We have a system in Ohio where I think [a little] less than half of the people in our prisons are in there for less than a year.  ... We have people who are check kiters and don't pay child support and we are locking them up in the state pen.""

Since the prison system is a major drain on the budget – and the subject of increased attention by Gov. Ted Strickland and the legislature since 2008 -- Politifact Ohio thought it’d be worth checking Kasich’s statements.

We started with the claim that a little less than half of the people in state prisons are incarcerated for a year.

The ODRC tracks prison intake and turnover in single calendar year to measure its impact on the cost and capacity of the prisons. The figure helps ODRC identify crime and sentencing trends.

This, says Kasich, is the context surrounding his comments on Dec. 3.

In 2009, 25,000 people were admitted to state prisons and 48 percent of them -- a little less than half -- were there for less than a year, according to the ODRC’s 2009 commitment report supplied by the state.

Kasich’s statement – Ohio is locking up check kiters and people who don’t pay child support – has to be measured against the 12-month intake figure, since these low level crimes do not carry long prison sentences.

Of the 25,000 people sent to the state slammer in 2009 – just one-third of 1 percent were there for passing bad checks, which ODRC tracks in a broader category of ""fraud offenses.""

Another 2.4 percent of the inmates were there for not paying child support, which is tracked in a larger category called ""Crimes Against Persons."" The category overall accounts for 24.76 percent but excludes sex crimes, which is its own category. Sex crimes account for 6.78 percent of the 12-month prison population.

Drug offenses top the list at 26.8 percent.

The prison system also tracks the average tenure of the entire population, which provides a snapshot of why people are in prison. The average stay, computed using the entire inmate population of nearly 51,000 – is two years. Nearly 42 percent of the long-term inmates are locked up for ""crimes against persons."" Another 14.5 percent are there for sex offenses.

We could end our review here but its worth adding more context to Kasich’s point that the state’s sentencing laws are plugging up the system.

He’s hardly the first politician to make the charge.

Ohio’s prison system is designed to hold 38,389 inmates. That means the current capacity is at 133 percent. The low-level offenders to state prisons take up processing costs and bed space. Alternatives – such as halfway houses and drug treatment and electronic monitoring – need better study to identify the most successful options. Low-threat offenders eat up a disproportionate percentage of probation resources.

All these are among issues raised by a study of the state’s criminal system undertaken by the Council of State Government Justice Reinvestment project. The large project had the backing of the governor and legislature.

Ohio Senate Bill 22 and its counterpart, House Bill 386, offer opportunities to correct some of the problems. The ODRC supports these and has endorsed other recommendations.

If Kasich is looking to place blame, he might look at the legislature – which his party will soon control – because the bills have stalled there.

To review, Kasich is correct to say the 12-month prison population accounts for a little less than half the overall prison population. And it’s true there are inmates imprisoned for check kiting and failing to pay child support. And while they represent just a fraction of the population, the governor-elect is basically on point: low-level, non-violent crimes are clogging the system.

Kasich is off point when he derides the ODRC for not having ideas on how to become more efficient, given the department’s efforts to support reform and the legislature’s failure to make it happen. But that comment isn’t part of the claim we’re evaluating here.

So, where does this leave his comments Truth-O-Meter?

We rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA23B00>],/factchecks/2010/dec/10/john-kasich/gov-elect-john-kasich-correct-nearly-half-ohios-in/
"['Rhode Island', 'Criminal Justice', 'Bloggers']","
Bloggers say Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ""voted to censor the Internet""
","
As the WikiLeaks  controversy rages and concerns about web censorship in China percolate, another Internet debate has erupted closer to home.

Bloggers, legal scholars, tech gurus and a host of others have accused 19 U.S. senators, Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse among them, of voting to censor the Internet.

The claims are intense -- hundreds of them sprinkled all over the Internet -- and they are angry.

The vote they're talking about happened Nov. 18, when the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the ""Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act,"" a bill they say would help the Justice Department crack down on websites that ""sell or distribute"" counterfeit or illegally copied goods, such as music or prescription medication.

If passed, the law would allow the U.S. attorney general to seek a court order to block a web address ""dedicated to infringing activities,"" in other words, sites whose only function is to traffic in counterfeit or unauthorized goods. If and only if a judge were to agree, the federal government could order the Internet provider to essentially remove that site from public view. The site wouldn't actually be gone. It would still be available through its I.P. address, a numerical identification code, for users savvy enough to find it that way.

The goal of the infringement bill is to curb online piracy and protect intellectual property by policing sites that violate the policy, according to its co-sponsor and Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.

""Rogue websites are essentially digital stores selling illegal and sometimes dangerous products. If they existed in the physical world, the store would be shuttered immediately and the proprietors arrested,"" Leahy wrote in a Dec. 7 commentary in The Hill, a congressional publication. ""There is no excuse for this behavior simply because it happens online and owners operate overseas. The internet needs to be free -- not lawless.""

The bill awaits consideration by the full Senate, which probably won't take up the issue before the lame-duck session ends.

But that didn't stop the buzz on the blogosphere. That same day, Wired.com posted a story under the headline ""Web censorship bill sails through Senate committee."" Techdirt, a leading technology blog, offered its own version: ""The 19 Senators who voted to censor the Internet.""

Buttressing those allegations was a strongly worded letter to the committee from a group of 49 prominent law professors who offered a grim assessment: ""For the first time, the United States would be requiring Internet service providers to block speech because of its content.""

First amendment groups and others expressed similar opposition.

The bill may be meant to target counterfeiters and pirates, but skeptics say they worry that, regardless of the original intent, it could create a framework that might one day allow zealous judges to block sites such as YouTube and Facebook, where users may unwittingly share copyrighted material. The threat to free speech is hard to ignore, they say.

""The genesis of law is to go after the worst of the worst offenders, but I fear it’s going to lead to Internet censorship down the line,"" said David L. Hudson Jr., a scholar at the First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University.

Those opposed say the legislation would also allow the Justice Department to blacklist websites with limited judicial review, blocking access to them through ""prior restraint"" before it is determined that the site is operating unlawfully.

Above all, critics say the bill threatens the very freedoms that make the Internet's flow of ideas so valuable.

""One thing people are really worried about is a worst case scenario -- for example, a politically biased AG using the bill if it became law to shut down a website just because he or she doesn’t agree with it,"" said Roger Williams University School of Law Assistant Prof. Zoe Argento, who was among the professors who signed the letter to Congress.

Argento cited the potential example of a blogger reprinting large portions of former President George W. Bush's new memoir for the purposes of criticizing it. A politically motivated attorney general could use the law to block the website, as opposed to going through the traditional process of a legal challenge where both sides are heard.

On the other side of this very heated issue, supporters, among them the entertainment industry and even the American Newspaper Association, say something must be done to protect intellectual property from online thieves. As of now, there are only a few means of recourse against such infringement: going after the individuals -- college students, etc. -- who purchased counterfeit materials, or by suing Internet service providers, thereby engaging in a protracted civil court battle.  

The infringement legislation, they say, will allow them to use the federal justice system to go straight to the source of a costly problem.

They dismiss concerns about the bill's so-called slippery slope, stressing the rigorous judicial review that all cases would have to undergo to ensure that the law applies. Websites can be blocked only if the U.S. attorney general can prove that it  ""has no demonstrable, commercially significant purpose or use other than"" to traffic in infringed or counterfeit goods.

In instances when copyrighted material has been stolen, the original, legitimate site will not be touched.  
 
""The law is meant to go after offenders who are the worst of the worst violators of intellectual property law. They are profiting off others work and the Supreme Court has held that such violations are not protected speech,"" said Matt Thornton, a spokesman for Whitehouse.

Leahy in his commentary piece agreed. ""Some have argued the conduct should be excused as free speech because it happens on the Internet,"" he wrote. ""That argument contradicts the basic tenet of copyright law, which, as Justice [Sandra Day] O'Connor explained, is the very 'engine of free expression.' ""

Even if you believe the bill is flawed, said Villanova School of Law Associate Prof. Michael Risch, ""when you view it in the most technical way, it's not censorship because the website is still up, you can still get to it through the I.P. address.""

Now back to the initial claim. It's clear the 19 senators voted unanimously to approve the bill, but does that constitute censoring the Internet? We argue that it does not. Censorship is defined as the deletion of speech or content considered objectionable. For example, when the Chinese blocked websites related to Tiananmen Square, that was censorship.

In this case, the sites this law could be applied to do not offer free speech of any kind, they distribute stolen or counterfeit goods. Even if you don't agree with that interpretation, consider what Hudson of the First Amendment Center told us: ""I fear it’s going to lead to Internet censorship down the line.""

The key there is the phrase ""down the line."" That may well be true. The threat of censorship could loom. But we simply do not know that for sure. And that was not the intention of the senators who voted in favor of the bill.

Had the bloggers proclaimed that the vote ""could lead to censorship,"" they'd be offering an opinion and we'd let them off the hook. But they didn't qualify their statements. They made bold allegations that relied on conjecture, not fact, thereby declaring that the bill will immediately censor the Internet.

It will not.

We find this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB0D940>],/factchecks/2010/dec/10/blog-posting/bloggers-say-sen-sheldon-whitehouse-voted-censor-i/
"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott claims his company caused national health care inflation to nosedive
","
Florida Gov.-elect Rick Scott touted himself as a businessman during his 2010 campaign. Now he says that steps he took at his former health care company caused national health care inflation to drop dramatically.

In a written copy of his speech to the Florida Council of 100 Governors on Nov. 18, 2010, a couple weeks after his victory, Scott said:

""We need to get a waiver to reform our Medicaid program and rework our health care benefits for state employees. Consumer directed care will lower the costs and increase the available choices. I have considerable experience in driving down health care costs while maintaining quality. The cost-saving measures we put into place at Columbia/HCA drove down national health care inflation from 18% to 8% in seven years.""

That's a massive drop -- and a major claim to suggest that the actions of one company could take credit for driving down national health care inflation. We wanted to know what seven-year period was Scott referring to and what was his source for his figures?

We contacted Scott's transition team and proceeded with our own research.

First, a refresher on Scott and Columbia/HCA that we pulled from a June 11, 2010, PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter item:

""Scott started what was first Columbia in the spring of 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. He quickly grew the company by purchasing more hospitals. A hospital network created efficiencies. Efficiencies created profits. In 1994, Scott’s Columbia purchased Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies. When Scott resigned as CEO in 1997, Columbia/HCA had grown to more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations in 37 states and two foreign countries, Scott’s campaign says. The company employed more than 285,000 people.""

Scott resigned amid a federal Medicare fraud investigation that led to the company paying $1.7 billion in fines. 
For decades, he has worked in the field of health care at high levels -- which means he should be an expert when talking about health care inflation. In addition to running Columbia/HCA and Solantic, a chain of walk-in clinics, Scott has long weighed in on national health care policy. An Aug. 7, 2010, Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times profile of Scott stated that in the 1990s Scott was a vocal critic of then-first lady Hillary Clinton's health care plan. In 2009, he formed a political action group called Conservatives for Patients Rights which fought President Barack Obama's health care plan. In a May 11, 2009, Washington Post wrote that Scott invested $5 million of his own money into CPR and up to an additional $15 million from supporters and had been making the rounds talking with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Scott is a guy with health care and business acumen. 
Now, let's return to our research about national health care inflation. We contacted the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics to obtain information on inflation. Since Scott started at Columbia in 1987, we thought he might have been referring to the seven years starting at that point. We looked at the years 1987 through 1997 -- when he started at Columbia and when he left Columbia/HCA.

We checked the ""medical care"" category, which includes physician services as well as expenses such as medications. BLS spokesman Gary Steinberg said Consumer Price Index data in the ""December"" category represents the 12-month change while ""annual"" reflects the change over 24 months.

To find double-digit increases in health care inflation over a 12-month period, we had to go back to the early 1980s -- before Scott's tenure at Columbia. The data showed national inflation for medical care at 12.5 percent for 1981 and a drop to 11 percent in 1982 -- that's as high as it climbed during the 1980s or since. In 1987, when Scott started at Columbia, national health care inflation was 5.8 percent, it dropped to 4.9 in 1994, and decreased again to 2.8 percent in 1997. Those figures are vastly different from the 18 percent to 8 percent drop that Scott cited.

It's worth noting that overall inflation in the U.S. also dropped between 1987, when it was 4.4 percent, and 1997, when it hit 1.7 percent, according to the CPI. Inflation refers to how much more -- or less -- the same service costs from year to year. For example in the health care arena, how much did a heart bypass cost in 2009 compared to 2008.

On Dec. 7, Brian Burgess, a Scott transition team spokesman, replied to our e-mail:

""Either you heard him wrong or he simply misspoke,"" Burgess wrote. ""In fact, the numbers are even better than that. The national health care inflation rate (i.e. measured as the cost of obtaining health care coverage) was around 18% in 1987 (Rick Scott's first year as CEO) and declined to 0.2% in his last year there.""

(Actually, we didn't ""hear"" Scott at all, since the press was barred from his speech. Nor did he misspeak, since the comment is part of the prepared written remarks distributed by Scott's staff.)

Burgess wrote that the source for Scott's claim was Mercer, a national HR consulting company based in New York. Burgess provided a link to a chart from Mercer called ""Annual Change in Average Total Health benefit cost"" for 1989 to 2006. The chart states that the data came from Mercer's national survey of employer-sponsored health plans. The chart shows costs rising 16.7 percent in 1989, peaking at 17.1 percent in 1990 and then nosediving during the next several years -- hitting 8 percent in 1993 and 0.2 percent increase in 1997 -- the year Scott left Columbia/HCA.

We spoke to Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer. She sent us data from Mercer showing cost increases at 18.6 percent in 1988.

But Umland said Mercer's data in that chart isn't national health care inflation -- it is the cost for employer-sponsored health plans. That means Mercer's data doesn't reflect health care consumers who use Medicare or buy their own individual plans or lack insurance entirely.

Scott's tenure at Columbia/HCA coincided with a major change in health care delivery. Before the 1990s, patients picked their own doctors and then sent in an insurance claim form. But in the 1990s, health plans started putting together provider networks and negotiating with doctors to provide lower rates. That's why costs dropped as consumers moved into less expensive plans, Umland said. Later, costs started rising because doctors started negotiating. Consumers also pushed back because they didn't like restrictive networks, so those networks grew. Umland sent us a chart comparing overall inflation, workers' earnings and annual change in total health benefit cost per employee between 1988 and 2008 -- which showed dramatic changes in health benefit costs.

We also spoke to Steven Ullmann, a professor and director of programs in health sector management and policy at the University of Miami. We asked: Could a single company -- such as Columbia/HCA -- claim credit for bringing down national health care inflation?

""No,'' Ullmann said. ""There were many factors impacting health care inflation at the time that brought it down.""

Ullmann agreed with Umland at Mercer that the growth of managed care brought down costs. But Scott's former company deserves some credit because HCA, as well as other for-profit chains, brought down some of their own costs, which put competitive pressures on other health care facilities to do the same, he said. But the Mercer data that Scott cited is not inflation, Ullmann said; it is the cost for employers to ensure their own employees.

Burgess sent several other links to charts about health care costs but since he said Scott's claim was based on information from Mercer we decided to focus on that information. We looked at the charts and three of them still showed health care inflation at no more than 12 percent over the past three decades. And the fourth one was about employer based health care premiums and underlying health care expenditures.

Let's review: Was Rick Scott's Columbia/HCA a slayer of the national health care inflation? He specifically claimed: ""The cost saving measures we put into place at Columbia /HCA drove down national health care inflation from 18% to 8% in seven years."" As evidence, he cited data from Mercer -- but that data was about employer costs, not national health care inflation. Health care inflation did drop between the late 1980s and the 1990s -- but not by the numbers Scott cited. And it's a stretch for Scott to suggest the actions of a single company caused that drop -- while the country was transitioning to managed care. With his hospital chain CEO background and national leadership on medical care and insurance issues, Scott should be considered a well-spoken expert on health care inflation. But we rate this claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBFC040>],/factchecks/2010/dec/09/rick-scott/rick-scott-claims-his-company-caused-national-heal/

Tom Coburn says that only 10 to 20 people die annually from foodborne illnesses
","
On Nov. 30, 2010, the Senate, by a 73-25 vote, passed the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, a landmark bill that would expand food-safety regulations. The House had earlier passed a different version, and the two chambers are now trying to reconcile the measures before the congressional session ends.

Almost two weeks before the Senate passed its version of the bill, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., made a floor speech critical of the bill. During the Nov. 18 speech, Coburn referred to the number of deaths from foodborne illnesses annually in the United States.

""The question is, how do we stop the 10 or 20 deaths a year from foodborne illness? Can we do that?"" Coburn asked. ""Well, as a physician trained in epidemiology, we could do it. But I will posit we do not have the money to do that because it would take billions upon billions upon billions of additional dollars to ever get there. So we find ourselves in a dilemma."" 
A number of readers wrote us to ask whether Coburn was correct, citing widespread media references to the U.S. experiencing 5,000 foodborne-related deaths a year. So we decided to take a closer look. 
The 10 to 20 deaths a year originates in a study by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The summary was published in the August 13, 2010, edition of the CDC publication Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The study recaps the number of illnesses and deaths caused by the 1,097 reported foodborne outbreaks in 2007, the most recent year available. The paper found that these outbreaks produced 21,244 cases of foodborne illness and 18 deaths. 
So, federal statistics do show that at least 18 people died from foodborne illness during the most recent year for which statistics are available. But epidemiologists say that statistic is a floor, not a ceiling, since there are several types of foodborne deaths that aren't included in that number. 
These were merely the deaths related to outbreaks that are officially reported to CDC. And CDC says that most foodborne illness is not associated with outbreaks, and would therefore not be included in these outbreak numbers.

A more inclusive way of looking at foodborne deaths comes from the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, or FoodNet. That's a program run by the CDC's Emerging Infections Program that tracks foodborne illnesses in 10 states, based on laboratory results. In 2009, FoodNet found 74 deaths caused by the 10 foodborne germs it tracks.

Since the 10 FoodNet states account for about 15 percent of the population, ""a reasonable extrapolation would put you close to 500 deaths"" nationally, said Craig Hedberg, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. ""These are real deaths associated with confirmed illnesses. This represents a justifiable minimum floor"" for the number of foodborne deaths every year. (There may be overlap between official outbreak deaths and FoodNet-reported deaths, so we'll just use the 500 deaths figure from FoodNet on its own.)

There's also a second layer of hidden foodborne deaths -- those that slip through the surveillance system and aren't tabulated as foodborne deaths at all. 
Many people with foodborne illness don’t seek medical care, and, even if they do, they may not see a doctor and have a lab test ordered. All of those steps are needed before FoodNet even hears about their case. 
The lack of lab testing means that ""there is usually no way to know whether (someone) got their infection from contaminated food or from another source,"" CDC epidemiologist Barbara Mahon told our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas in September. ""Only if they are part of an outbreak for which a source is determined -- usually less than 5 percent of cases of Salmonella infection -- would it be possible to know where that particular infection came from. Otherwise, it might or might not have been foodborne.""

As a result, Mahon said, estimating the true number of Salmonella deaths due to food requires looking at ""many different kinds of data from multiple sources and using appropriate statistical techniques to adjust for the various sources of infection and for under-diagnosis and under-reporting.""

The CDC is currently working on a new estimate -- which is expected to be released soon, a spokeswoman said, -- so for now, the most recent figures come from a 1999 paper. This paper, published by the CDC and authored by a team led by epidemiologist Paul S. Mead, included the following estimate that has been quoted countless times over the last decade -- ""76 million illnesses, 323,914 hospitalizations, and 5,194 deaths each year.""

The numbers look quite specific, but they actually mask quite a bit of uncertainty. In the paper, the authors note that ""precise information on food-related deaths is especially difficult to obtain because pathogen-specific surveillance systems rarely collect information on illness outcome, and outcome-specific surveillance systems (e.g., death certificates) grossly underreport many pathogen-specific conditions.""

So, in order to estimate the number of deaths due to foodborne bacteria, the team calculated the number of deaths among reported bacterial cases, then doubled this figure to account for unreported deaths, and then multiplied by a percentage of infections believed to be attributable to foodborne transmission.

This represented a good-faith effort to estimate the number of foodborne deaths, but it still relied on assumptions that could be -- and have been -- challenged by other scientists. At least one other paper published by CDC -- written by Paul D. Frenzen, a U.S. Department of Agriculture demographer -- warned that the estimate was ""inherently uncertain."" In fact, the real number of deaths, if it could be accurately calculated, might either be higher or lower than the roughly 5,000 cited in Mead's paper.

""The estimate of deaths (in the Mead paper) was derived from hospital discharge and death certificate data on deaths attributed to gastroenteritis of unknown cause,"" Frenzen wrote. ""Fatal illnesses due to unknown foodborne agents do not always involve gastroenteritis, and gastroenteritis may not be accurately diagnosed or reported on hospital charts or death certificates. The death estimate consequently omitted deaths from unknown foodborne agents that do not cause gastroenteritis and likely overstated the number of deaths from agents that cause gastoenteritis.""

Hedberg, of the University of Minnesota, agreed that, while the number of foodborne deaths fluctuates from year to year, the number may well be lower than the 5,000 cited commonly in the media. However, he added, it is certainly at least the 500 suggested by the tracking by FoodNet. ""There can be no doubt that the number is much higher than 10 to 20,"" he said.

Other experts agreed. ""There is no factual (or imagined) truth to Sen. Coburn's comment,"" said Michael Osterholm, the former Minnesota state epidemiologist. 
When we contacted Coburn's office, spokesman John Hart noted that Coburn's broader point was that the frequency of foodborne illness has been decreasing over time. ""In 1996, for every 100,000 people in this country, we had 51.2 cases of foodborne illness--the best in the world, by far,"" Coburn said in the speech. ""But, in 2009, we only had 34.8 cases--three times better than anybody else in the world. So the question has to be asked: Why are we doing this now when, in fact, we are on a trendline to markedly decrease it? The second question that should be asked is: No matter how much money we spend, is there a diminishing return?"" 
These are fair questions, but they don't justify Coburn's later use of a lowball estimate of deaths from foodborne illness. We would have given him some credit if he'd said there were 10 to 20 deaths per year from officially declared outbreaks, even though this still would have been misleading since official outbreaks represent a fraction of all cases. We also acknowledge that reasonable scientists can disagree over whether Mead's team made the right assumptions when they made their calculations. But Coburn's estimate also ignored a much more solid number -- the number of deaths estimated through laboratory-confirmed data from FoodNet. By themselves, the confirmed death figures just from FoodNet's 10 states are roughly five times bigger than Coburn's estimate, and the national approximation based on those numbers is 25 times as large. So we rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC693140>],/factchecks/2010/dec/09/tom-coburn/tom-coburn-says-only-10-20-people-die-annually-foo/

Sen. Mark Warner estimates national debt grew $15 billion over weekend
","
U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner says Washington must spoon out foul-tasting medicine to ease the nation’s debt.

The Virginia Democrat is urging the White House and congressional leaders to consider strong doses of spending cuts and tax increases brewed this fall by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. The recommendations, which include trimming or ending the deduction for home mortgage interest, were set back last Friday when they failed to receive a super majority of votes needed on the bipartisan commission to advance them to Congress.

Warner, who is not a member of the commission, says the proposals could reduce long-term debt by an estimated $4 trillion over the next decade.

""The seriousness of our nation’s fiscal challenges -- the compelling need to address these issues in a responsible and bipartisan way -- did not suddenly dissipate or magically disappear over the course of the weekend that just ended,"" Senator Warner said in remarks on the Senate floor Monday. ""In fact, since the Commission’s final meeting ended on Friday afternoon, the national debt -- the running tally of what the United States government owes -- has increased by an estimated $15 billion.""

That’s a sobering credit card tab for a weekend, so we looked into the numbers.

Asked for a source, Warner spokesman Kevin Hall sent us a national PolitiFact story that looked at a claim by Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., that the debt increased more than $1.7 billion during an 11-hour Wimbledon match in June..

That story looks at the change in debt in a couple of ways.

One way uses the Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of the president's budget, which was released in March. This predicts a $1.368 trillion deficit for 2010. If you divide this by 365 days, you get an incremental, daily addition to the debt of $3.748 billion. Over three days, the total is $11.244 billion. That doesn’t quite live up to Warner’s claim.

Another way uses the Office of Management and Budget’s historical tables for federal debt. These tables list the federal debt as it stands every year on Dec. 31. If you take the debt estimate for the end of 2010 ($13.787 trillion) and subtracted the debt as it stood at the end of 2009 ($11.876 trillion) you can determine the debt increase over the course of 2010 ($1.911 trillion).

Dividing by 365, you get a daily debt increase of $5.236 billion, or about $15.7 billion over three days. So by that token, Warner’s correct that the debt could increase by an ""estimated"" $15 billion over three days.

We thought it would be interesting to see if it actually had.

Unlike the previous PolitiFact story, which relied on an average because it measured a span of hours, Warner’s three-day time span can be checked using official debt figures from the U.S. Treasury.  

The Treasury keeps historical debt to the penny figures for each business day. We looked at the change from Friday ($13.834 trillion) to Monday ($13.835 trillion).

So in reality, not even close. Without rounding, the debt increased only about $1.3 billion over the weekend -- almost $14 billion short of Warner’s claim.

Joyce Harris, a Treasury Department spokeswoman with the Treasury’s Bureau of Public Debt, said these numbers are ""absolute,"" with accountants measuring inflows and outflows, and added that calculations based on averages are entirely unsafe due to fluctuations.

""Keep in mind that bonds and securities are being redeemed all the time,"" she said.

""Debt accumulation is pretty random,"" agreed Marc Goldwein, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan New America Foundation. ""It isn't even linear from month-to-month, let alone day-to-day. In fact, even in this world of trillion dollar per year deficits we have days and weeks when debt goes down...A small snap shot in time is not a very useful indicator of the debt’s trajectory.""

Let’s recap.

Based on daily debt calculations using Office of Management and Budget data, Warner’s absolutely correct.

Looking back using the Treasury’s actual debt figures? Not so much.  

But we can’t say Warner was off by nearly $14 billion for two reasons: 1) the Treasury’s official numbers aren’t released until one business day after the date they reflect, so he couldn’t have known Monday’s debt figure on Monday, and 2) he is careful in his wording to point to ""estimates"" rather than claim the figure is correct for that specific period of time.

So we find his claim to be True.

"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Alberta Darling']","
State Sen. Alberta Darling says Wisconsin’s state deficit is proportionally as bad as California’s
","
When the state owes you money, you expect to get a check, not an IOU.

But in California, budget problems got so bad that in 2009, the state issued temporary IOUs to state employees and business contractors. In 2010, it delayed issuing tax refunds as well as payments to schools, community clinics and day care providers.

In October, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed nearly $1 billion in spending from the 2011-2012 budget. Then, less than two months later, he ordered the legislature into special session to address a $19 billion deficit in that budget as well as a $6 billion shortfall in the 2010-2011 one.

Now those are some serious budget problems.

Believe it or not, Wisconsin’s budget situation is just as bad, according to Wisconsin state Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills).

On the ""Upfront with Mike Gousha"" TV news program Dec. 5, Gousha asked Darling about contracts the state is negotiating with state employee unions. Darling said the contracts should not be finalized until after Republican Governor-elect Scott Walker replaces Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle on Jan. 3.

""I think what we need to do is say, Can we afford the benefits and salaries that we pay for our state employees? That is the question,"" said Darling, who will co-chair the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee starting in January. ""We are in deep debt. Our spending is over the top.

""And we are proportionally in as much trouble as the State of California, who we hear about all the time in national news.""

Hey, we were planning on getting a state tax refund from Madison in a few months.

If cautious Wisconsin is in as much of a fiscal mess as crazy California, we’d like to know now.

Let’s sort it out.

One of Darling’s aides said the 20-year state lawmaker based her comment on a December 2009 article by Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance.

Using the most recent figures available at the time, Berry said that Wisconsin’s 2007-2008 state budget deficit of $2.5 billion amounted to $445 per person -- tops in the nation. California, according to Berry’s analysis, ranked fourth at $113 per person.

So, as of mid-2008 Wisconsin was actually worse off than California.  

But Darling’s claim was that Wisconsin is in as much trouble as California is now.

Berry provided us state deficit numbers for 2008-2009, the most recent period, and suggested we use 2008 U.S. Census population figures to make the same per-capita calculation. He said that’s what the census bureau does when generating per-person state statistics for budget periods that start in one calendar year and end in another.

Our calculations show Illinois had the highest state budget deficit per person ($595.39) for 2008-2009. Wisconsin was second ($481.81) and California was third ($437.58).

So by that measure, Wisconsin was still in worse shape than California as of mid-2009.

But let’s look at a more common measure used by a number of national research organizations -- budget shortfall as a percentage of a state’s budget.

Jon Shure, an official at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the percentage is preferred over deficit per capita because it compares a budget shortfall to the state’s budget, rather than to an ""artifice"" such as population.

Shure’s group, based in Washington, D.C., found that Wisconsin’s 2008-2009 budget gap was 11.7 percent of its budget. California, at 36.8 percent, was much worse off.

We checked with other outside groups as well, some of which have made projections into the future. That helps provide perspective on the comparison Darling is making.

2009-2010

In a November 2009 report, Beyond California: States in Fiscal Peril, the Pew Center on the States labeled Wisconsin as one of 10 states in fiscal trouble. The rankings were based on six measures, including budget gaps.

""California’s problems are in a league of their own,"" the report said. But Wisconsin ""narrowly"" made the list partly because of ""the size of the hole"" the recession made in the state budget.

The report said Wisconsin’s 2009-2010 budget gap was the equivalent of 23.2 percent of its  state budget. Not good, perhaps, but much better than California, which was at 49.3 percent.

2010-2011

In October 2010, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that Wisconsin’s shortfall in the current budget -- 2010-2011 -- was $3.4 billion, or 23.9 percent of its budget.

That indicated Wisconsin was in slightly worse shape than California, whose deficit was $17.9 billion, or 21.6 percent of its state budget.

2011-2012

Looking ahead, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities put Wisconsin’s budget gap at 8.7 percent of its total budget for 2011-2012. Much better than California’s 25.7 percent.

The National Conference of State Legislatures, in a report released Dec. 7, 2010, also found Wisconsin better off. The report says Wisconsin’s gap is 9.2 percent of its general fund budget while California’s is more than twice as high, at 18.7 percent.

2012-2013

The National Conference of State Legislatures also projects gaps out to 2012-2013. The budget gap for both states is expected to grow -- but again, Wisconsin fares better.

The report projects Wisconsin’s gap at 9.6 percent and California’s at 20.2 percent.

Back to the present:

There has been considerable debate about the size of Wisconsin’s current budget shortfall. We rated as False the claim by Doyle’s administration that it is $1.5 billion. The general agreement is around $3 billion.

The situation has prompted unpaid furlough days, and promises from Walker to seek union concessions. But unlike California, Wisconsin has not been in the national news for extreme measures, such as issuing IOUs or paying its bills late.

So is Darling’s comparison of the Badger State to the Golden State on the mark?

In the TV interview, she said Wisconsin is ""proportionally in as much trouble"" as California and pointed to figures from a year-old article as support. Those figures showed that Wisconsin’s budget deficit per person was higher than California’s; updated numbers for  2008-2009 also put Wisconsin’s per-person deficit higher than California’s.

But under a more common measure that many consider a stronger approach -- budget shortfall as a percentage of a state’s budget -- various groups found Wisconsin in better shape than California in 2008-2009 and in 2009-2010; in slightly worse shape in 2010-2011; but much better off than California for 2011-2012 and 2012-2013. Darling’s statement was on target to a point, but left out important details. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBCFFBC0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/09/alberta-darling/state-sen-alberta-darling-says-wisconsins-state-de/
"['Oregon', 'Food Safety', 'Regulation', 'Randy Leonard']","
Portland city commissioner Randy Leonard says Seattle bans food carts
","
In an otherwise humdrum council discussion over dumpsters on sidewalks, city Commissioner Randy Leonard dropped this bomb: He plans to crack down on Portland’s popular food carts by making sure they meet building code.

""Some cities such as Seattle have just taken the option of banning them; they don’t allow them,"" he said at a recent City Council meeting. ""We’re trying to find a balance where they can be allowed, but in a safe way and in a way that complies with health safety laws, fire code and building code regulations.""

PolitiFact Oregon has seen food trucks -- Korean tacos, anyone? -- in Seattle. Heck, here’s an article called ""Eight Great Street-Food Vendors in Seattle."" So we weren’t sure what Leonard meant by the word ""banning.""

We figured this would be easy enough to check, and in the process, explain a topic of interest to Portlanders and street food fans. What we learned is that Leonard was sort of -- but not quite -- right when talking about our sister city to the north.

It’s important to keep in mind that food carts and the larger food trucks are different, even though folks tend to use the words interchangeably. In Portland, the city allows food carts on sidewalks so long as the carts are self-contained, of a certain size, don’t compete with existing eateries and don’t cause a sidewalk jam. Vendors need to get a yearly permit from the city and they’re allowed to sell an assortment of foods, including burritos, soup, sandwiches and Thai noodles.

Rich Eisenhauer, the city’s sidewalk management expert, says Portland used to issue about 30 to 35 food cart permits a decade ago; the number has dropped to about 18. Where did they go? Well, the sidewalk carts probably expanded into private parking lots -- and these are the eateries that Leonard is targeting. Food trucks, like the food carts, are licensed and inspected by Multnomah County. At last count, the county had permits on file for 609 food carts and trucks.  

Now, what about Seattle? Washington state law limits what’s sold from sidewalk food carts -- to hot dogs, popcorn, snow cones, coffee, chestnuts, maybe buttered corn cobs  --  but there’s no such restrictions on food trucks parked in private lots. However, unlike in Portland, food trucks don’t stay in Seattle lots overnight. That’s because of state health laws that require trucks to return to an approved commercial kitchen ""commissary"" every night to refrigerate food, wash dishes, and properly dispose of dirty grey water.

Leonard interprets that as a de-facto ban.

It should be noted that Seattle is trying to be more like Portland. The city has persuaded the county to consider more than just hot dogs when approving mobile food units, of which there are 137 in the city proper. Also, Seattle Councilwoman Sally Clark is readying legislation to allow food trucks to park on streets and sell directly to customers on the sidewalk.

""We’re so good at (regulation) that we have hardly any street food scene here,"" said Gary Johnson, who is with the city’s Department of Planning and Development.

Johnson said vendors in Seattle often travel certain routes throughout the week, settling in a different location every day. He doesn’t expect that to change, given the county’s health regulations. In Portland, we like our food trucks in fixed, predictable pods. Oregon state law allows mobile vendors to handle food and clean up in a commissary, or have sinks and other cleanup facilities on-site.  

And that’s the problem. Food vendors get too comfortable when they don’t have to move. Awnings go up and seats sprout. As the commissioner in charge of the Bureau of Development Services, Leonard didn’t like that trucks were building decks and patios without proper permits. ""We have taken a different view, and therein we have created these permanent establishments, which has caused a lot of angst with restaurant owners and code purists,"" he said.

So in Seattle fixed food pods aren’t allowed and only certain food items can be sold from sidewalk food carts. But neither of those factors translate into a city ban on food carts, as Leonard said. Yet the statement contains some element of truth. We rate it Barely True.

"['Agriculture', 'Ohio', 'Economy', 'Taxes', 'Jim Zehringer']","
Rep. Jim Zehringer on point with comment on loss of family farms in Ohio
","
Echoing Gov.-elect John Kasich’s pledge to cut taxes, Ohio’s incoming agriculture chief recently called for the elimination of the state’s estate tax.

The tax has contributed to the declining number of family farms in Ohio, said State Rep. Jim Zehringer, a Republican from Northwest Ohio whom Kasich recently picked to lead the state’s Department of Agriculture.

""Ohio is losing over 700 family farms a year, some of them just to pay the inheritance tax,"" Zehringer said at a Nov. 16 news conference at which Kasich introduced him as the new agriculture director.

Kasich, a Republican who defeated Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland in November, has specifically called for the elimination of the tax, which Zehringer referred to as the inheritance tax, because he believes it punishes success. An estate tax is levied on the net value of an estate before its assets are transferred to anyone else.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look, given the farming remains one of Ohio’s key industries.

First we looked to see if the number of family farms actually is decreasing at the rate Zehringer claims.

Rob Nichols, a spokesman for John Kasich, said Zehringer based his claim on the United States Department of Agriculture’s statistics, specifically, an agricultural census the department conducts every five years.

For his assessment, Zehringer compared figures for one classification of family farms. The USDA, however, also counts ""family-held corporations"" within its definition of family farms, according to Amanda Pomicter of the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service. Family-held corporations represent only a fraction of family farms in Ohio, but their inclusion does color the picture of how fast the number of family farms are shrinking in the state.

Here is a comparison over the last 15 years of the figures Zehringer used and statistics that include family-held corporations.

 Year         Family farms only     Family farms and corps
1992         60,936                         62,538
1997         69,123                         71,099
2002         70,890                         72,579
2007         66,382                         69,131

Nichols told us that Zehringer used the most recent of these five-year stretches for his assertion. Ohio lost 4,508 family farms in that span for an average of about 902 farms a year. If the statistics Zehringer used showed a 900-farm-per-year decline, why did he ballpark the annual losses at 700? He was being conservative, Nichols said.

Had Zehringer also included in his analysis farms owned by family-held corporations, he might have reduced the annual decline even further.

In the same five year stretch, using the figures the USDA prefers, Ohio lost 3,448 family farms for an average of 690 lost farms per year.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture won’t begin counting farms for its 2012 census until the end of that year, so the figures for 2007 represent the most recent available data.

Another point of clarity is needed for Zehringer’s assertion that the state’s inheritance tax is causing the state to lose family farms.

John Kohlstrand, a spokesman for the Department of Taxation, said the state does not have an inheritance tax. He said inheritance taxes apply to each individual who receives property from an estate.

Ohio has an estate tax, which is levied on the net value of an estate before its assets are transferred to anyone else. In e-mails, Nichols told us that was what Zehringer was referring to and that it is ""universally known"" that some family farms are sold because the estate tax could not be paid.

In Ohio, estates worth $338,333 or less are effectively exempt from the state estate tax due to a tax credit, which is available to all estates, of up to $13,900. A 6 percent tax rate applies to estates worth between $338,334 and $500,000. For estates worth more than $500,000, the tax is $9,700 plus 7 percent of the estate’s value. A federal estate tax also exists. It was phased out in 2010 as part of the Bush tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of the year, pending an extension by Congress. 
The U.S. Agriculture Department does not track how many family farms are lost due to estate taxes, said James Ramey, director of the Ohio field office of the USDA’s National Agriculture Statistics Service.

Neither does the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation. But Joe Cornely, the bureau’s spokesman, said Zehringer is ""absolutely right"" that the Ohio estate tax contributes to the decline in family farms. Sometimes a chunk of a farm is sold to pay federal and state estate taxes and, as a result, the farm is no longer commercially viable, Cornely said.

The federal estate tax is more burdensome, but ""inheritance taxes, regardless whether it’s state or federal, can have negative consequences on the heirs,"" he said

The food and agriculture industries are a $98 billion business in Ohio. The loss of family farms, particularly in light of Kasich’s commitment to job creation, is sure to be something the incoming Agriculture chief will monitor.

Zehringer’s data is somewhat dated, and he didn’t include all types of family farms in his analysis. His statement is not far off the annual decline found in Ohio using statistics the USDA prefers. And ultimately, the differences in numbers don’t impact his underlying point.

As for the estate tax’s role in the decline, it’s difficult to say exactly how many family farms were lost for that reason. But Cornely, an authority on Ohio agriculture, said his is sure ""some"" of the loses would be due to taxes.

We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA66480>],/factchecks/2010/dec/09/jim-zehringer/rep-jim-zehringer-point-comment-loss-family-farms-/
"['Oil Spill', 'Florida', 'Alex Sink']","
Alex Sink says BP claims administrator slow to respond in Florida
","
In her last meeting of the Florida Cabinet, state Chief Financial Officer and unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink took BP claims administrator Ken Feinberg to task for failing to live up to his promise to swiftly respond to oil spill claims from Floridians and Florida business owners.

Sink, who has been critical of BP and the handling of the claims process, said Floridians are having their claims denied without being given a reason, that people in similar situations are having their claims processed differently, and that Feinberg has been ""incredibly unresponsive to Floridians and to Florida business owners.

""It just reveals that this process continues to be inefficient,"" Sink said near the end of a five-hour Cabinet meeting on Dec. 7, 2010. ""One hundred, fifty thousand claims have been filed by Floridians, but only 40 percent of them have been paid, a third of them have been denied ... and then we have 20 percent that are still in limbo land.""

Now, more than seven months after the initial Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, we wanted to see if Sink is describing the speed of the claims process correctly.

To recap, President Barack Obama selected Feinberg to manage the disbursement of $20 billion provided by BP to compensate spill victims through something called the Gulf Coast Claims Facility. Feinberg has been criticized by politicians at the state and national level for months for what some politicians have called a much too slow response.

Sink spokesman Kevin Cate pointed us to the Gulf Coast Claims Facility's own analysis as evidence of the slow claims process.

Cate used the latest statistics available for Dec. 7. 
We should note that as of Dec. 7, Feinberg has awarded more than $900 million to Floridians and Florida business owners. Almost all of the money paid out is compensation for lost earnings or profits. You can read the latest report for yourself here.

In lashing out against BP claims administrator Feinberg, Sink noted that of all claims made in Florida following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, only 40 percent had been paid. She's just about right on. So far, about 43 percent of claims submitted by Floridians or Florida business owners have been paid, another 39 percent have been denied and a little more than 18 percent are still under some type of review. We rate Sink's claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA62C80>],/factchecks/2010/dec/08/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-bp-claims-administrator-slow-respon/

Barack Obama off in description of how Social Security, Medicare evolved
","
In a Dec. 7, 2010, press conference, President Barack Obama kicked off his effort to sell a deal he had struck with congressional Republicans to extend the tax cuts initially passed under George W. Bush. The president had already been facing opposition from congressional Democrats and liberal activists for siding with the Republicans by agreeing to extend expiring tax cuts for wealthier Americans. So part of Obama's comments were aimed at explaining and justifying why he had compromised rather than continuing to fight for the position for which he had advocated as a presidential candidate.

In making the argument that half a loaf was better than none, Obama cited two earlier landmark programs -- Social Security and Medicare.

""Not everybody agrees with us,"" Obama said. ""I know that shocks people. The New York Times editorial page does not permeate across all of America. Neither does the Wall Street Journal editorial page. Most Americans -- they’re just trying to figure out how to go about their lives and how can we make sure that our elected officials are looking out for us. And that means because it’s a big, diverse country and people have a lot of complicated positions, it means that in order to get stuff done, we’re going to compromise. This is why (President Franklin D. Roosevelt), when he started Social Security, it only affected widows and orphans. You did not qualify. And yet now it is something that really helps a lot of people. When Medicare was started, it was a small program. It grew.""

An alert reader wrote us to suggest that Obama was not accurate in the way he described the origins of these programs. So we decided to look into it.

Social Security

On Social Security, Obama had a point that the program started slowly and expanded over time. But he was flat wrong that it began by serving only widows and orphans. This can be confirmed by looking at a historical page on the Social Security Administration's own website.

Title II of the Social Security Act of 1935 ""was the new social insurance program we now think of as Social Security,"" the SSA website says. ""In the original Act, benefits were to be paid only to the primary worker when he/she retired at age 65. Benefits were to be based on payroll tax contributions that the worker made during his/her working life. Taxes would first be collected in 1937 and monthly benefits would begin in 1942. (Under amendments passed in 1939, payments were advanced to 1940.)""

The history page continues, ""The original Act provided only retirement benefits, and only to the worker. The 1939 amendments made a fundamental change in the Social Security program. The amendments added two new categories of benefits: payments to the spouse and minor children of a retired worker (so-called dependents benefits) and survivors' benefits paid to the family in the event of the premature death of a covered worker. This change transformed Social Security from a retirement program for workers into a family-based economic security program.""

So, widows and orphans were indeed covered early on, but they were only covered after retired workers had already been granted coverage -- not the other way around, as Obama had suggested in the news conference. An SSA spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that the president's interpretation ""is not accurate.""

Still, if Obama's specific details were wrong, he was more accurate on the larger point. ""Social Security did start small and expand in many ways after its initial enactment,"" said Paul Van de Water, a Social Security expert at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. ""Benefit amounts were increased in 1939, even before the first payments were made. Coverage was originally limited to workers in commerce and industry and was expanded substantially in 1950 and thereafter. Disability benefits were added in 1954 for people age 50 and over and in 1960 for those under 50. Early retirement benefits were added in 1956 for women and in 1961 for men. Automatic cost-of-living increases in benefits were not enacted until 1972.""

Medicare

Obama is even less accurate in his description of Medicare. The health care program for the elderly was passed in 1965, and in retrospect, it emerged with remarkable speed.

Medicare ""was implemented in less than one year, an administrative tour de force of which the SSA commissioner at the time, Bob Ball, remained proud until the day he died,"" said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. The bill even made provisions for elderly Americans who would not have been covered since they had not worked long enough to qualify for Social Security. Under an amendment named for Sen. Winston Prouty, R-Vt., this coverage was financed with general revenues.

It's true that Medicare has expanded in size and cost since its creation. But that is mostly because health care was less expensive at the outset, and because of natural population growth, said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.

""Medicare was not small when it started,"" said Princeton University historian Julian Zelizer. ""It provided a well-defined right to insurance for the elderly and was up and running within one year. Much of the infrastructure of program was in place by 1966, and it was quite substantial.""

So let's recap. Obama had a point that Social Security started small and expanded slowly, but he was clearly incorrect that the first groups to be covered were widows and orphans. On Medicare, it's not accurate to say, as the president did, that the program started ""small."" It was up and running for elderly Americans within one year -- four years faster than it will take the health care exchanges created in Obama's own health care bill. On balance, we rate the item False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBC7A40>],/factchecks/2010/dec/08/barack-obama/barack-obama-description-how-social-security-medic/
"['Israel', 'Terrorism', 'Transportation', 'Florida', 'Allen West']","
West says U.S. failed to learn from Israel after Sept. 11
","Allen West, a retied Army lieutenant colonel  who won a South Florida Congressional race Nov. 2, 2010, is outspoken on security measures.

West was one of a handful of guests on NBC's Meet the Press Nov. 21, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. In the interviews that occurred just days before the big Thanksgiving holiday travel weekend, terrorism and security was one of the main topics, including the controversy about pat-downs of passengers at airports.

David Gregory, the show's moderator, asked West a question about airport pat-downs.

Here was the full response from West, who represents Congressional District 22 in Broward and Palm Beach counties, according to the MSNBC transcript:

""I think it may end up becoming an issue, especially when we come out of this holiday season and we see how that affects us -- the travel and the, and the economy. But I think, once again, it comes back to marketing. I mean, we should have put out some type of feelers and talked to the American people about this before we go and implement this type of plan. And also, when you go back, you look at after September 11, we had the opportunity with Israel coming and talking to us about improving our security screening procedures, and we turned them down. I traveled to Israel, and I tell you what, they have very good procedures, and you don't have to go through all of these very draconian practices.""

For this Truth-O-Meter, the part of West's claim that we were interested is about Israel. After the terrorist attacks in the skies on Sept. 11, 2001, did the U.S. turn down an opportunity to talk to Israel about airport security screening procedures?

We contacted West's spokesperson Angela Sachitano on the afternoon of Dec. 3 and asked her to provide documentation that the U.S. passed up an opportunity to talk to Israel about security screening procedures after Sept. 11. We also asked Sachitano to explain what West meant by ""we"" had the opportunity to meet with ""Israel."" Did West mean then-President George Bush? The Pentagon? Congress? And by ""Israel"" did he mean the airline El Al or some government official or entity in Israel?

On Monday morning, Sachitano replied by e-mail: ""The Congressman has declined this request.""

So we proceeded on our own. We interpreted West's claim to mean that some U.S. officials had the opportunity to meet with Israeli officials to discuss how the U.S. could improve airport security screening and the U.S. turned down that opportunity to meet. We did a newspaper clip search about Israel in the month after Sept. 11. We found several articles stating that while Congress was debating a bill to tighten airport security, members of Congress met with representatives from El Al, Israel's state-run airline, behind closed doors.

An Oct. 5, 2001, article in the Jerusalem Post stated that Israel was helping the U.S. by providing intelligence assistance and security advice after the terrorist attacks. The Jerusalem Post article stated that ""participants in the meeting said the committees would take the advice of the El Al representatives into consideration"" when drafting aviation security bills. The Washington Post also wrote about the meeting in an Oct. 5, 2001, article, describing the ""four top security experts from El Al"" who met with the committee.

We also interviewed Greg Soule, a spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration, which was formed after Sept. 11.

""TSA has worked with many international partners including Israel since the agency’s inception in November 2001,"" he wrote. ""TSA officials have met with Israeli officials multiple times to discuss transportation security, as well as share best practices and other pertinent information.""

So clearly U.S. officials -- the TSA and members of Congress -- met with Israeli and El Al officials in the aftermath of Sept. 11. In the late afternoon Dec. 6, we e-mailed our findings to Sachitano to give West one more chance to respond.

Sachitano responded by e-mail: ""Clearly the Congressman meant that yes, although leaders from the United States did in fact meet with officials from El Al post 911, the U.S. turned down their recommendations. Without a major airline attack since the 1970's, Israel is obviously doing many things right and the Congressman believes the U.S. has a lot to learn from the Israeli's approach to airline security.""

We asked Sachitano if she could be specific about which recommendations and whether West meant that the U.S. rejected Israel's recommendations or rejected a meeting. She wrote: ""The U.S. met with El Al and reviewed its best practices in order to prevent against terrorist attacks to their airplanes However, the U.S. turned down the opportunity to incorporate some of those best practices into U.S. airline security where the screening focus (is) on individuals and the specific threats.""

We ran that explanation by Rafi Ron, former director of security at Tel Aviv Ben-Gurion International airport and now CEO of New Age Security Solutions in northern Virginia. Ron said that Sachitano's explanation was ""more precise."" We asked him to explain the difference between the two countries' airport security screening.

""The main focus of the Israeli solution is based on the idea that you need to identify the level of risk of each individual passenger and adjust the level of search to the level of risk,"" Ron said. ""Over here there is no such process that identifies the level of risk of every single passenger at all -- the only thing that is done is checking names against the no fly list and watch list. .... The American model can be described as one size fits all while the Israeli solution can be described as a tailored security process based on identifying the level of risk of each passenger. That is a substantial difference.""

We were not sure if Sachitano was trying to change West's claim after reading our findings that U.S. officials clearly met with Israelis or if from the outset he meant that the U.S. rejected an opportunity to adopt Israeli security screening procedures. We sent West's initial claim to a few other journalists at the Miami Herald and St. Petersburg Times to ask them how they would interpret it -- without telling them what we initially thought. But there was no consensus.

So the only thing that was clear about West's claim was that it was not entirely clear what he meant. If he had meant to convey that the U.S. did meet with Israel about airport security screening but rejected suggestions from the Israelis, would that be true?

Soule of the TSA also told us that the TSA's behavior detection model is based on the Israeli model -- though Ron said the U.S. lacks Israel's thorough process of interviewing passengers. So that means that the U.S. did not totally reject Israel's procedures but it's clear the two systems are quite different.

Though scores of news reports immediately after Sept. 11 highlighted El Al as a model of airport security, several news stories also stated that adopting El Al's model is not so simple. El Al has far fewer flights than major American airlines, spends more on security and uses racial profiling.

On Oct. 1, 2001, USA Today wrote: ""Still, it is not clear that El Al's security can be duplicated. El Al's flight load -- about 40 flights a day to about 51 destinations -- is minuscule compared with any major American airline. The largest U.S. carrier, American Airlines, by comparison, had about 2,400 daily flights before Sept. 11. And until now, Americans would have resisted the lengthy time involved in the screening process, which can even result in flight delays until the questioning is complete."" The article raised concerns about ""El Al-style ethnic profiling,"" noting that passengers are divided into low-risk (Israeli or foreign Jews), medium-risk (non-Jewish foreigners) and extremely high-risk travelers (anyone with an Arabic name). ""Single women,"" it said, ""also are considered high-risk, for fear they might be used by Palestinian lovers to carry bombs.""

An article in the Los Angeles Times Oct. 5, 2001, stated: ""Israel's El Al Airlines spends 8% of its revenue on security, 75% of which is subsidized by the government, according to (airport security expert Peter) Walsh. American airliners, by contrast, pay 0.2% or 0.3% of their revenue toward security.""

Let's review West's words: ""And also, when you go back, you look at after September 11, we had the opportunity with Israel coming and talking to us about improving our security screening procedures, and we turned them down.""

It's possible for those who read or heard West's claim to interpret that to mean the U.S. rejected the opportunity to meet with Israel to talk about improving airport security screening procedures. On that front, he would clearly get a False rating since TSA officials met with Israelis and members of Congress met with El Al. At PolitiFact Florida, we evaluate politicians' actual words. In this case West's words weren't clear and he initially declined to explain himself. Only after we sent West our findings showing that the U.S. did meet with the Israelis did he offer an alternative explanation -- that the U.S. met with Israeli officials but rejected their model for improving our airport security screening -- and we find some truth in that. So we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC634CC0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/08/allen-west/west-says-us-failed-learn-israel-after-sept-11/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Ted Poe']","
Ted Poe says under the DREAM Act, after undocumented residents spend two years in higher education or the miltary, they are eligible for citizenship and to bring the rest of their extended family here
","
Criticizing an immigration proposal that would allow undocumented residents brought to the United States as minors to qualify for citizenship, U.S. Rep. Ted Poe of Texas says illegal immigrants are ""breaking the bank."" 
In a Poe opinion piece posted Dec. 2 on Newsmax.com, the Republican from Humble questions why Congress would pass a law ""that discriminates against Americans and lawful immigrants to the benefit of those who break our laws?"" 
""After you complete two years of post high school education or two years of military service you are eligible for citizenship,"" he writes. ""Once a citizen, this paves the way to bring the rest of their extended family to the United States."" 
We wondered if Poe correctly summarized the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act. 
Poe did not initially respond to our inquiries. 
To start, we read the latest version of the act, Senate Bill 3992, which was introduced Nov. 30 by Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois. 
According to the legislation, undocumented residents become eligible for its benefits if they're younger than 30, have been brought to the United States at age 15 or younger and have lived here for at least five years prior to the measure becoming law. 
Also, such a resident must spend 10 years in the United States as a ""conditional non-immigrant,"" during which he or she must complete two years of higher education or serve in the military. One year before the 10-year period is up, ""conditional non-immigrants"" may apply to become a permanent resident. 
Even then, it's not bad-a-bing, citizenship. Applicants must be of ""good moral character,"" have not committed a felony, haven't persecuted someone based on their race, religion or nationality, engaged in voter or marriage fraud and submit to a background check and physical exam, among other hurdles. 
After three more years, the permanent resident is eligible to become a naturalized citizen. 
Barbara Hines, a law professor who specializes in immigration at the University of Texas at Austin, told us: ""It is a 13 year process to citizenship, far longer than for any other immigrant group... there is way too much disinformation out there."" 
Next, we wondered: Could these new citizens then bring their ""extended"" family to the United States, as Poe says? 
That depends on how you define extended family. By some definitions, it extends beyond the nuclear family (parents and their children) to grandparents, grandchildren, aunts and uncles, as well as spouses who are not blood kin. 
The U.S. State Department says on its website that U.S. citizens can sponsor immediate family members — a spouse, unmarried children or adopted children under 21 — to enter the country with an ""immediate relative immigrant visa."" Citizens 21 and older can sponsor their parents as well. 
A citizen can also enable older children, their spouses and children, and siblings, their spouses and minor children to relocate here, though a limited number of ""family preference immigrant visas"" are available for such relatives, according to the website. When the number of applicants for that visa exceeds the number available, applicants get bumped to a waiting list. 
Citizens cannot sponsor grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins or in-laws to get visas. 
Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute, a group that is generally pro-immigration, said: ""The lines for sponsoring extended relatives, particularly from countries such as Mexico and the Philippines, can be very long, with waits of years and sometimes more than two decades."" 
Hines echoed that sentiment. ""For a sibling, for example, from Mexico, that wait is at least 12 years or more because the visas for that category move very slowly."" 
As we were wrapping up this article, we made a final run at getting Poe's perspective. DeeAnn Thigpen, a Poe spokeswoman, told us that Poe was summarizing ""several versions of the bill"" — there are various versions floating around Congress. When we relayed our research to her, specifically about the number of family members that U.S. citizens cannot sponsor to come here, she said: ""That's still a large amount of family that you're able to bring."" 
Upshot: Two years in a higher-ed institution or the military is key to achieving citizenship under the DREAM Act, as Poe says. 
But he skips over many other stipulations that an undocumented resident must satisfy before becoming a citizen. The proposed process would not be rapid, nor would the outcome be assured. 
After achieving citizenship, a formerly undocumented resident could sponsor some family members to move here—parents, children, grandchildren, spouses, siblings, nieces and nephews (if they're minors). But that doesn't mean they could bring in all the rest of their extended family, contrary to the statement. Left out: Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and in-laws. 
We rate Poe's statement as Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE42BC0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/08/ted-poe/ted-poe-says-under-dream-act-after-undocumented-re/

Ohio Gov.-elect John Kasich rejects passenger train he says will travel an average speed of 39 mph
","
Gov.-elect John Kasich rarely minces words when it comes to the proposed Cleveland-to-Cincinnati passenger train, declaring the idea ""dead"" under his watch while deriding the locomotives ""high speed"" moniker.

The train, supported by outgoing Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, would operate four times a day, making six stops (including Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Cincinnati) over its 258-mile trek across Ohio. And it comes with a $400 million check from the federal government, enough to get the train up and running by late 2012, supporters say.

The rail plan Kasich says prefers -- one to get Ohio’s economy moving forward -- is to get more freight trains to ship goods made in Ohio to out-of-state places. He calls the passenger train a ""money pit"" because it is estimated it will cost the state about $17 million annually to maintain and operate it, with no guarantee enough Ohioans will buy tickets to eat up those expenses.

But most of Kasich’s criticism about the passenger train has targeted its projected speed.

""They tried to give us $400 million to build a high-speed train that goes 39 miles an hour,"" Kasich told CNN reporter John King during a television interview on Nov. 19.

He said something similar the day after his election during a news conference in Columbus. Kasich recalled being in a deli in Plain City while on the campaign trail where a model train was set up inside the restaurant going in a huge circle.

""You know, I think that (toy) train goes faster than the 39 mph high-speed train,"" Kasich said. He was being sarcastic, yes, but sticking to an underlying point that the proposed passenger train would travel too slowly for anyone to actually want to ride on it.

Strickland’s administration says Kasich is deliberately misleading Ohioans about the train’s speed to win support for his idea to scrap the plan altogether and that the new governor knows that its average speed will be faster than 39 mph.

Politifact Ohio decided to check.

Confusion over the train’s projected speed can actually be pinned on the Strickland administration.

The initial proposed schedule called for the train to complete the route from Cleveland to Cincinnati in 6.5 hours. While the top speed would be about 79 mph, the average would be just 39 mph. A person driving a car between the two cities could make the trip at the posted vehicle speed limits in a little over 4 hours.

To combat that criticism, the Ohio Department of Transportation hired a railroad planning firm to study and revise the travel schedule. It surmised that by taking out some curves and switching up the planned route it could shorten the trip’s duration. ODOT released an updated report in September saying the newer analysis cuts the trip down from 6.5 hours to 5 hours and 15 minutes and increases the average speed from 39 mph to just over 50 mph.

That report has gone unchallenged to this point, and it’s average speed is in line with the average speeds of passenger trains in Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma, according to ODOT.

That’s fast enough for Strickland officials to want to keep this project on track. Strickland rejected Kasich’s request to pull the idea saying not only will Ohioans ride the train but that the plan could produce about 16,000 jobs.

Also, ODOT in October released a report declaring that more Ohioans are riding passenger trains, proof the Strickland administration says that the 3C train would be a success.

Kasich has not let up.

He’s written to both Strickland and President Barack Obama asking them to forget the train program altogether and allow Ohio instead to use the $400 million on some other infrastructure projects.

After the Obama administration rejected that request, Kasich enlisted the help of outgoing Republican Sen. George Voinovich. In November, Voinovich introduced a bill to allow Kasich to bypass federal authorities and use the money to fix Ohio’s roads and bridges rather than build a passenger train. The bill, however, isn’t expected to survive.

Other states, meanwhile, have said they’d like Ohio’s share of rail money if Kasich doesn’t want it.

So Kasich is correct in that the federal government has approved $400 million in stimulus for development of high-speed rail service in Ohio.

But his use of 39 mph as an average speed for the train relies on projections the administration discarded and ignores results of a newer study that included changes to the rail route. That’s an important detail; one that’s needed to keep things in context.

We rate Kasich claim about the 3C train as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBED5E80>],/factchecks/2010/dec/08/john-kasich/ohio-gov-elect-john-kasich-rejects-passenger-train/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says his 250,000 jobs promise was a ""big goal""
","In a TV ad that sounds like a closing argument for the Nov. 4, 2014 election, a hoarse Gov. Scott Walker takes on Mary Burke’s criticism over private-sector job growth that has lagged behind the national average on his watch. ""Before we took office, the policies my opponent supports cost Wisconsin 133,000 jobs,"" Walker says in the TV ad, which debuted Oct. 22, 2014. ""We set a big goal of creating 250,000 jobs because I know Wisconsin can do great things."" With just a couple months left in his term, private-sector employment has increased by 111,000, or about 44 percent of the 250,000 figure the Republican governor promised. The ""big goal"" statement is part of an effort Walker has made in recent weeks to cast his 250,000-job promise as bold and aggressive, while contrasting it with the dark days of the Great Recession. We’ve previously checked a Walker claim that the policies of his predecessor Jim Doyle (who appointed Burke as his Commerce secretary) caused the loss of 133,000 jobs in the Democratic governor’s second term from 2007 through 2010. We rated that Mostly False. The number is accurate, but the national recession was mainly to blame, not any particular governor. Wisconsin, in fact, fared somewhat better than the rest of the country during that major downturn. And, in any event, Burke left state government before the recession began. But what about Walker’s claim of the 250,000 promise being a ""big goal""? ""Big,"" of course, is an imprecise word. But what Walker is talking about has a clear statistical underpinning. That is, we can compare his goal -- and the growth it would have required to meet it -- with job growth in past four-year periods, both in raw numbers and as a share of the private-sector job base at the various times. The goal and the 2010 race In the 2010 race, Walker’s opponents made more modest promises. Republican Mark Neumann, who Walker defeated in the primary, pledged  300,000 jobs in 10 years. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, whom Walker defeated in the general election, promised 180,000 in three years -- a slightly slower pace than Walker’s pledge. Shortly after Walker’s November 2010 election, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter Rick Romell found that ""most recoveries since World War II have produced the rate of job growth needed to achieve Walker's goal."" But ""most"" is not all, and that November 2010 story pointed out that unusually slow job growth has marked the last two recessions -- the one in the early 1990s and the Great Recession, which officially ran from 2007 to 2009. The recovery after the 2001 recession earned the label ""jobless recovery."" ""But this one,"" economist John Heywood said at the time, referring to the Great Recession, ""is putting that one to shame."" A somewhat dissenting view came from retired chief state labor economist Terry Ludeman, who said a standard recovery should restore the recession’s job losses naturally. A closer look We decided to check the recent history ourselves, starting with Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson’s first term in 1986. After all, during the 2010 campaign, Walker cited that term as inspiration for his 250,000 goal. We relied on the quarterly employment data reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that private-sector employment grew by 233,000 in Thompson’s first term. And, significantly, that was the high-water mark in any administration since then -- or in any four-year period since 1986 regardless of whether it corresponded with a governor’s term in office. The next closest was 1991-’95 (232,000). So Walker’s goal topped actual performance over the previous quarter century, at least in raw number of jobs added. For perspective, in only six of the 24 periods we examined since 1990 did job growth top 200,000 over a four-year stretch. Notably, when Walker made his promise in 2010, the previous two periods were in the negative for growth, starting with 2004-2008 (-6,800) and 2005-2009 (-146,000). When he made promise in early 2010, the Great Recession officially was over and massive job losses had stopped, but Wisconsin was still losing jobs on a monthly basis. So reaching the 250,000 goal was far from a lock. But there’s another way to look at the numbers. Economies grow over time, and the employment base was one-third smaller in the 1980s than it was when Walker made his promise. That means that when 233,000 jobs were added in Thompson’s first term, that actually was better growth in percentage terms than what Walker assumed when making his pledge. The liberal Center on Wisconsin Strategy summed up its view this way: ""Well, it is certainly a lot of jobs. But let’s keep it in perspective. Population has grown by about 2 percent since the beginning of the recession. To get employment back to its pre-recession level, we would need to create more than 270,000 jobs."" Our rating Walker portrayed his 250,000 jobs promise as a ""big"" goal. The growth rates needed in a post-recessionary period to make that number happen were not uncommon after World War II. But that was not the case during the two most recent recoveries, and at the time Walker made the promise it had been nearly 15 years since the state had seen sustained growth at that pace. In raw terms, the 250,000 hoped-for gain was a bigger figure than the actual gains over any four-year period since at least the mid-1980s. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8A73C0>],/factchecks/2014/oct/30/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-his-250000-jobs-promise-was-big-/

Gina Raimondo says she battled against the ill-fated 38 Studios deal from the beginning
","The role played by Democrat Gina Raimondo in Rhode Island's investment in 38 Studios, the now-defunct video game company created by former Boston Red Sox star Curt Schilling, has been a source of contention throughout her run for governor. Raimondo’s Republican opponent, Allan Fung, has attacked her for urging the state to pay investors who bought the moral obligation bonds used to raise money for the company. In response, since Oct. 7, 2014, the Raimondo campaign has repeatedly aired a television commercial called ""From the Beginning,"" which is intended to address the controversy. ""You might have seen Allan Fung’s ad attacking me over 38 Studios,"" it begins. ""I fought 38 Studios from the beginning."" Raimondo has repeated that claim in debates, with Fung challenging that claim, saying that one email doesn't constitute a fight. So who’s right? First, a little background. In 2010, the General Assembly passed a bill authorizing the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation to guarantee up to $125 million in economic development bonds. The bill did not mention any potential beneficiary. But within weeks, the beneficiary became clear when the EDC approved a $75-million loan guarantee for 38 Studios. The company ultimately went bankrupt; the EDC, now the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation, owes a total of  $115.9 million in principal, interest and fees to repay the bonds. At least two prominent Rhode Island politicians vigorously opposed the deal when it was proposed. Lincoln Chafee, when he was running for governor as an independent in 2010, repeatedly urged the EDC to reject the proposal. He repeatedly tried to address the EDC directly and showed up at one of its meetings, only to be rebuffed. Then-General Treasurer Frank Caprio, a Democrat also running for governor, eventually joined Chafee in his opposition, to the point where Gov. Donald Carcieri, who chaired the EDC, complained, ""The attitudes and positions taken by Mr. Caprio and Mr. Chafee serve only to undermine the positive economic development steps the state has taken in recent years."" Where was Raimondo, then a candidate for general treasurer, in all this? On July 16, 2010, she wrote an email to Keith Stokes, then EDC's director, expressing ""significant concerns."" ""I would proceed very carefully on this,"" she wrote. ""The fact that many have looked at it and passed is a red flag,"" a reference to other groups that had decided not to help finance the 38 Studios venture. So she was clearly voicing serious concerns. In addition, Raimondo's TV commercial references The Providence Journal of July 22, 2010, where an Ed Fitzpatrick column quotes Raimondo as saying, ""Truly, this is a gamble. This company hasn’t launched a game yet. It’s pre-revenue; they haven’t made one penny. This could very easily be out of business in a year or two."" The column appeared two days before the EDC took its final vote on the 38 Studios deal. Fitzpatrick, paraphrasing Raimondo, wrote: ""Venture capitalists prefer to spread risk among a portfolio of 20 to 30 companies, but this $75-million loan guarantee is a big chunk of the state's new $125-million Job Creation Guaranty Program."" Then he quoted Raimondo as saying, ""This strategy is like, 'put all your chips on red and cross your fingers. It makes me nervous.'"" But neither example shows Raimondo actively fighting the project. We asked Raimondo's campaign if it had any evidence of the candidate trying to block the deal. Spokeswoman Joy Fox said Raimondo met with Stokes and separately with Karl Wadensten, the only EDC member to vote against the proposal. We checked with Wadensten. He said he asked her about the pending deal during commercial breaks when he had her on his WPRO radio show. Asked about Raimondo's claim that she fought the deal, he responded, ""With who? That's what I'm trying to figure out. With who? I had already made up my mind at that point."" He said he couldn't recall how strongly she advised against the deal. Our ruling Gina Raimondo says, ""I fought 38 Studios from the beginning."" It's clear Raimondo had concerns about the deal. But calling something ""a gamble,"" saying a deal makes you ""nervous"" and urging someone to ""proceed very carefully"" signals opposition but doesn't rise to the level of fighting. We couldn't find -- and her campaign couldn't produce -- any evidence that she actively tried to block the 38 Studios loan or that she specifically told anyone in authority that the deal should be rejected. To say she ""fought 38 Studios"" is a big stretch. We rate her claim as Mostly False.

Dan Patrick says Leticia Van de Putte voted to stop schools from removing felons from classrooms
","A TV ad from Republican Dan Patrick, a Houston state senator, unsurprisingly criticizes his Democratic opponent for lieutenant governor, Leticia Van de Putte, for opposing ""school choice,"" which can describe public dollars made available for students to attend private schools. Another statement in the ad delivers more of a shock: ""Liberal Leticia actually voted to stop schools from removing teachers convicted of a felony,"" the narrator says, ""convicted"" appearing in red. We were unaware of any lawmakers voting to keep schools from firing felons. By email, Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia said the claim reflected a vote by Van de Putte, a San Antonio state senator, against a 2011 measure passed into law making it easier for Texas schools to fire teachers convicted of felonies. We looked at the change in law and at Van de Putte’s related votes on House Bill 1610, which originated in the House but was carried in the Senate by Patrick. Then we gauged if her ultimate opposition to the proposal was the same as voting against schools removing felons. House Bill 1610 The adopted change in law permitted a school that becomes aware of a worker’s felony conviction to suspend the employee without pay or void his or her contract and terminate the worker ""as soon as practicable,"" without a provision for teacher appeals. Teacher groups and the Texas Education Agency told us districts already could remove felons. But under the previous law, teachers had ""due process"" rights. Those were eliminated by the 2011 measure, potentially saving school districts time and money. By email, Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Lauren Callahan said the pre-2011 law said a district could terminate a teacher for ""good cause"" after giving proper notice and giving the teacher the option of a hearing and possible appeal to the state education commissioner. ""For teachers convicted of a felony, HB 1610 removed the teacher’s right to notice, a hearing and appeal to the commissioner,"" Callahan said. which made ""it quicker, easier and cheaper for school districts to terminate teachers convicted of felonies."" Callahan also pointed out a pro-and-con House Research Organization analysis of the legislation cited by Patrick stating that under the previous law, a teacher could be immediately fired only if he or she was convicted of a violent crime or a crime against a minor, leaving out crimes that destroy public trust, such as theft, burglary, and embezzlement, the report said. In contrast, the analysis said, opponents of the proposal said the changes could lead to a teacher losing his or her teaching certificate for any felony, which could punish some teachers needlessly for mistakes made in their younger years. The report continued: ""The current system works and should be maintained. The bill would take away a teacher’s right to due process by prohibiting an appeal. If a school district or charter school was wrong to terminate a teacher, the teacher would have no recourse to challenge the decision."" Van de Putte’s actions We divined more detail from legislative records including audio and video available online. According to March 22, 2011, testimony by a Houston-area school lawyer to the Texas House Committee on Public Education, under the old law districts wishing to act against a felon-teacher had to present a case for termination before an independent hearing examiner, a process costing money and taking 90 to 120 days, lawyer David Hodgins testified. ""These are very rare situations,"" Hodgins told the House panel. ""But when they do happen, they are very critical to a school district."" According to a May 2011 summary of the legislation by the Texas Senate Research Center, an educator convicted of certain felonies, including felonies involving a minor, already could have their teaching certificate revoked. The summary said the law also required that an educator be removed from campus or administrative office upon notice of the conviction, but the law didn’t require anyone to be fired immediately. ""As a result, many school districts place these individuals on paid administrative leave when scheduled for termination rather than go through a costly administrative  hearing process,"" the center said. In the 2011 session, the Texas State Teachers Association, Association of Texas Professional Educators and Texas Federation of Teachers opposed the quick-termination proposal, while it the support of the Texas Association of School Boards and Texas Association of School Administrators, according to witness lists created by House and Senate committees that advanced the measure. According to Texas Senate records, Van de Putte supported and opposed the proposal at different times. Specifically: --On March 23, 2011, she voted for a committee substitute for the House-originated proposal  and asked to be shown as making the motion to send the revised measure to the full Senate; --On May 21, 2011, when the Senate took up the proposal, she expressed misgivings about the sweep of the plan, but also told colleagues that ""certainly"" if a teacher was convicted of a felon, his or her school should be able to act quickly. Van de Putte also unsuccessfully offered an amendment to remove the provision for quickly terminating school employees who’d received ""deferred adjudication"" for felonies. ""My worry,"" she told colleagues, ""is that deferred adjudication does not imply guilt."" Her amendment also sought to limit those felonies enabling speedy firings to ones related to a worker’s job performance. Senators tabled her amendment after Patrick said it ""guts the bill."" --A moment later, she was among nine Democrats to vote against the final version of the proposal. By email, Van de Putte spokesman Manny Garcia said Van de Putte made her favorable committee motion as a favor to the panel’s chair, then-Sen. Florence Shapiro, R-Plano. Garcia said Van de Putte voted for the same version in committee ""because she supported it in principle, however she also acted in good faith that her concerns of the bill being overly broad would be addressed on"" the ""Senate floor, where she would offer an amendment."" Garcia said: ""Her concerns were that the language of the bill did not account for when the offense occurred in that person’s life and allowed for it to include"" a ""first-time felony-level off-duty DWI conviction."" After her proposed changes were spurned by the Senate, he said, she voted against final approval. Meaning of voting 'no' So, was the Democrat’s ""no"" vote in the end also a vote to stop schools from removing teachers convicted of felonies, as Patrick says? Callahan of the education agency offered no comment on that while teacher groups, some supportive of Van de Putte’s candidacy, each stressed the previous law’s permission for districts to fire teachers for good cause. Monty Exter, lobbyist for the ATPE, said by email: ""Voting down HB 1610 would not have stopped schools from removing teachers convicted of a felony; it would have simply required districts to continue to observe the teachers’ due-process rights in situations not already covered by"" a measure passed into law in 2007. That year’s Senate Bill 9 required districts to remove a teacher convicted of either violent crimes or a crime requiring registration as a sex offender. Van de Putte voted for its final passage. By phone, Lonnie Hollingsworth, an attorney and advocate for the Texas Classroom Teachers Association, said Patrick’s claim was largely incorrect, though it is so that Van de Putte voted to stop schools from terminating teachers convicted of a felony ""without due process."" Our ruling Patrick said Van de Putte ""voted to stop schools from removing teachers convicted of a felony."" Nope. There was never a vote to stop schools from firing teachers convicted of a felony. Still, Van de Putte voted against making it easier to terminate such teachers – a toughening that was supported by Patrick to wipe out the right of teachers to request an independent hearing before being let go.

","U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett’s smiling face appears on a mailer sent out by a group advocating voter approval of a City of Austin rail proposition on the November 2014 ballot. We noticed a not-so-happy message. ""Don’t let the Tea Party fool you,"" says a headline below the photo of the Democratic congressman from Austin on the placard mailed to voters by Let’s Go Austin, a group that favors the proposal to spend $1 billion on a light rail line and roads. Doggett goes on to say: ""Proposition 1 is a smart investment in Austin’s future."" Below, he extolls the spending plan and then says: ""The Austin Tea Party and an ultra-conservative millionaire are behind the misleading campaign against Prop. 1, but don’t you buy it."" The mailer doesn’t say how opponents have been ""misleading."" Setting aside that characterization, we wondered if Doggett was right about the Austin Tea Party and a conservative millionaire leading the ""no"" campaign. An Oct. 8, 2014, Austin American-Statesman news story on spending by forces for or against the proposal didn’t mention tea-party groups while identifying Citizens Against Rail Taxes as the major group working against approval and briefly mentioning Our Rail, which the story described as opposing the proposal and preferring a different rail route. According to the story, Citizens Against Rail Taxes had raised nearly $279,000 through late September 2014 from 13 donors including the retired high-tech executive serving as the group’s treasurer, Jim Skaggs, who the story personally credited with giving $50,000. Our Rail had raised $760, the story said Doggett, asked the basis of his claim, told us via spokeswoman Leslie Tisdale that Skaggs has supported ""ultra-conservatives"" like Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and state Sen. Donna Campbell of New Braunfels. ""Surely,"" Doggett also said by email, ""the Austin Tea Party doesn’t deny its active opposition to Prop. 1."" Lynda Rife, campaign manager for Let’s Go Austin, separately confirmed by email Doggett was referring to the Austin Tea Party, which recommended voters oppose the proposition in an Oct. 19, 2014, online post, she pointed out. That post said in part: ""This is just another boondoggle thought up by our current corrupt and mismanaged city council."" Before that, Rife noted, Americans for Prosperity, a national group supportive of tea-party efforts, brought Cato Institute anti-rail activist Randal O’Toole to Austin for September 2014 events promoted by the Austin Tea Party. Also, Rife pointed out, the group has posted multiple messages opposing the proposal on its Facebook page. Rife said the millionaire in the ad is Skaggs, the retired CEO and board chair of Tracor Inc. ""Skaggs,"" Rife asserted, ""has an extensive history of giving to Republican candidates and organizations in both state and federal elections."" Austin Tea Party Campaign finance filings with the City of Austin don’t show any Austin Tea Party expenditures in the run-up to balloting. By phone, Dean Wright, the group’s organizer, told us the group hasn’t spent money opposing Prop. 1. Otherwise, Wright said, it’s referred what he estimated to be close to 3,000 individuals in its network to Citizens Against Rail Taxes, which he said has taken ""the leadership position."" Wright said the Austin Tea Party supports CART’s messaging. We saw several anti-rail-proposition messages in the Austin Tea Party’s Twitter posts including a message written Oct. 24, 2014 referring to Doggett as ""Kickback Lloyd"" that was linked to its criticisms of Doggett’s pro-proposition message. Jim Skaggs By email, Skaggs confirmed he’s a millionaire. He didn’t commit to membership in any party. ""I frankly do not frequent the political world and do not really know the definition of  ‘conservative,’"" Skaggs wrote. ""I am a common-sense person and dislike some of what all parties do. I was born a Central Texas Democrat."" Skaggs said Rife was incorrect about Americans for Prosperity bringing O’Toole to Austin. We reached O’Toole by phone who told us that out of interest in the rail vote, he decided to visit, going on to acquire his own plane ticket. O’Toole, who said he stayed with Skaggs, said Americans for Prosperity sponsored one of his Austin events by reserving the room. Our search of campaign finance reports filed with the Texas Ethics Commission showed Skaggs making about 100 donations totaling over $100,000 to state-level Republican candidates or political groups from 2002 to September 2014; the biggest one was $10,000 given in 2008 to the political arm of the Texas Republican Advisory Council. Skaggs also has contributed to multiple Republican candidates or groups involved in federal races. In 2013, Skaggs gave donations of $2,600 to U.S. Reps. Michael McCaul and Roger Williams, both R-Austin, according to information drawn from federal campaign finance filings by the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Responsive Politics. In May 2014, the center indicates, Skaggs gave $300 to the Republican National Committee. Over earlier years, another search of the center’s database indicates, Skaggs (who lives a few miles from the Texas Capitol in a part of Travis County not in Austin) gave money to Republicans including Cruz ($1,250); Texas U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (more than $4,000); President George W. Bush ($4,000); 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney ($4,000); Sen. John McCain, the party’s 2008 nominee ($2,300); and presidential hopefuls Ron Paul ($1,000) and Herman Cain ($300). In the early 1990s, Skaggs contributed to two Democrats, the center's database suggests, then-U.S. Rep. Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma ($500) and then-U.S. Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico ($250). Our ruling Doggett said: ""The Austin Tea Party and an ultra-conservative millionaire are behind the"" campaign against the city’s light-rail proposition. Skaggs seems wealthy, has supported Republican candidates and is treasurer for the major group battling Prop. 1. The Austin Tea Party opposes the proposal too. However, the group hasn’t spent a dime on the cause and doesn’t appear to be a major mover in the anti-Prop. 1 campaign. We find this statement Half True.

Critics say Elizabeth Warren 'lives in a $5.4 million mansion'
","Nothing animates political discussions like the appearance of hypocrisy. And for some critics these days, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., offers a tempting target. Warren, elected in 2012, has become a leader of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, decrying the excesses of Wall Street and income inequality. These efforts -- and the possibility that she could run for president in 2016 -- has made her a high-profile political figure. Here’s a social media meme we recently received: ""Senator Liz Warren lives in a $5.4M mansion, claimed 'Native American' status to score a Harvard gig paying $350,000 to teach one class, and now lectures us that 'the system is rigged to benefit the rich.' "" That’s a lot to chew on, so we’ll limit our analysis here to the claim that Warren ""lives in a $5.4 million mansion."" It’s a claim that mirrors others cited elsewhere in the media -- for instance, in an op-ed in the Boston Herald and in an article in the Huffington Post, both of which say Warren’s house is worth $5 million. But is it really worth that much? No. After plowing through public real estate data, we found that the house Warren shares with her husband, Bruce Mann, is worth less than half that -- though it’s located in a desirable neighborhood in Cambridge, Mass., so it’s still pretty expensive by most Americans’ standards. (Warren's staff did not respond to an inquiry for this story.) House values According to real estate records, Warren’s house -- a clapboard Victorian built in 1890 -- was purchased in 1995 for $447,000. Back then, the median sale price for a single-family home in Cambridge was roughly $300,000, so the house was definitely above average for the city at the time. The amount paid for the house in 1995 works out to just shy of $700,000 in today’s dollars. But it was a smart purchase. The house’s assessed value for 2015 was a bit over $1.9 million, and as is often the case, the expected resale value is higher. The real estate website Zillow.com estimates that the house’s value today is about $2.4 million. That’s well above the median price of homes currently listed in Cambridge, which Zillow says is $639,000, though in Warren’s immediate neighborhood, several houses have values exceeding $2 million and more exceed $1 million, according to Zillow. It’s worth noting that the use of the term ""mansion"" may be a bit of a stretch. The house has two bedrooms and three-and-a-half baths, and 3,728 square feet of living space. According to the Census Bureau, the median new home in the northeastern United States in 2010 had 2,392 square feet. So Warren’s house is bigger than average, but hardly Versailles. Indeed, almost half of the house’s $1.9 million in assessed value comes from the land, not the structure itself. And a key factor in the price growth likely stems from its location in a good school district, the easy access to fancy neighborhood amenities, and its close proximity to Harvard University, where Mann is a law professor, and where Warren taught before winning her Senate race. So where did the $5 million figure come from? A garbled financial disclosure report, most likely. Warren’s 2011 financial disclosure report, required of Senate candidates, listed the house as having a value of between $1 million and $5 million. This disclosure form only requires the candidate to gauge asset values within broad ranges, rather than a specific amount. Somewhere along the line, some authors started neglecting to mention that the $5 million figure was the upper range for the house, not its specific value. (Other articles were more careful.) A final note: Warren is wealthy by national standards, but so are a lot of other senators. In the most recent Roll Call survey of congressional net worth, Warren ranks 24th among senators with an estimated net worth of $3.66 million, and 76th among the 535 members of the House and Senate combined. So her net worth is well above average, but it’s nowhere near the congressional or senatorial top 1 percent. Our ruling The social media meme said Warren ""lives in a $5.4 million mansion."" Warren does live in a desirable neighborhood in an expensive urban center, which means that her house is much more expensive than that of most Americans. Still, the meme overshoots the facts of the case. The house’s estimated value is less than half of the stated $5.4 million, and calling it a mansion is a stretch. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE42840>],/factchecks/2014/oct/29/facebook-posts/critics-say-elizabeth-warren-lives-54-million-mans/

Did Scott Walker oppose a proposal for refinancing student loans?
","Financial aid for college has gotten its share of attention around Wisconsin during 2014, and moreso in the days leading up to the Nov. 4, 2014 gubernatorial election. When U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said college students on average are graduating with $30,000 in student loan debt, we rated her claim Half True. Some reliable data indicated the figure is accurate, but other figures suggested it might be lower. And when U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., claimed the affluent are taking advantage of student loans at the expense of middle-class families, our rating was Mostly False. He overstated the problem on both ends. In the governor’s race, Democratic challenger Mary Burke has said easing student loan debt is one of her priorities. Her claim that there are 41,000 people on a waitlist for financial aid for Wisconsin technical colleges and universities earned a Mostly True. The number wasn't totally firm, but pretty solid. Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has touted his tuition freeze at University of Wisconsin System schools rather than discussing college financial aid. But on Oct. 27, 2014, the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee, which has run TV ads criticizing Walker, released another ad making this claim: ""Scott Walker opposed a plan to help Wisconsin students refinance their student loans."" Let’s see. Refinancing proposals It turns out the Greater Wisconsin Committee doesn’t have any proof that Walker opposed a state proposal to help students refinance student debt. Rather, the group contends that since Walker didn’t speak, or take action, in favor of the plan proposed by Democrats, he opposed it. Walker ""has had every opportunity to show support for this legislative proposal. He specifically chose not to express support and has instead avoided the topic altogether,"" the group’s executive director, Rich Judge, told us in an email. Judge referred to legislation announced in October 2013 to create a state student loan refinancing authority. Legislative committee hearings were held on the proposal in February 2014. But no votes were ever taken by a committee or the full Legislature, so the issue never reached Walker’s desk. Judge also noted that Walker refused an April 2014 request from Democrats to hold a special session of the Legislature. But he noted that request was to take up not only the refinancing proposal but a number of other bills, as well. Finally, Judge cited a September 2014 news article in the Green Bay Press-Gazette about a Walker campaign appearance. Walker did not speak specifically about student loan debt during the stop, but did say he prefers controlling tuition over government-subsidized financial aid, the newspaper reported. Walker was quoted as saying: ""We know it's not just about providing more financial assistance, it's about providing a great price for a UW education that's low to begin with."" But none of the above shows opposition by the governor to the refinance proposal. We found another September 2014 news article, in the Racine Journal Times. That article reported that Walker said he would be willing to look at measures like the refinancing bill, but questioned whether the proposal is ""more than just politics"" because Democrats had not enacted it when they controlled the Legislature and the governor’s office prior to his election in 2010. ""If it was a good idea, I’m sure they would have passed it four years ago when they controlled the Assembly and the Senate and the governorship,"" Walker was quoted as saying in response to questions from reporters. ""They not only did not do it then, they presided over a state government that saw 5.5 percent average annual increases in tuition."" Walker certainly isn’t declaring support for the refinancing authority, but he isn’t stating opposition, either. Our rating The Greater Wisconsin Committee says Walker ""opposed a plan to help Wisconsin students refinance their student loans."" The group acknowledged it has no evidence that Walker opposed a 2013 Democratic proposal to create a state student loan refinancing authority. Walker may not support the idea, but he hasn’t fought it, either -- as the group claimed.

"['Campaign Finance', 'Financial Regulation', 'Texas', 'Wendy Davis']","
Wendy Davis said Greg Abbott cleared ""unlimited"" fees for politically generous payday lenders
","Wendy Davis, asked if she’s unethically profited while in public office, suggested her opponent has committed infractions including one that resulted from hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations. Responding to a reporter at the Sept. 30, 2014, gubernatorial debate in Dallas, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee and Fort Worth state senator accused Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, her Republican foe, of selling out Texans to serve the ""interests of people who make donations to his campaign."" As an example, Davis pointed out ""payday lenders who have given"" Abbott’s campaign ""$300,000 and then received a ruling from him that they can operate in a loophole in the law that allows them to charge unlimited rates and fees."" Davis was revisiting a topic she’s consistently explored: that a 2006 letter from Abbott’s state office allowed payday lenders to skirt state lending laws. After Davis’ proclaimed link between Abbott’s campaign donations and official action was described by the El Paso Times in January 2014, we found Half True her statement that Texas payday lenders were charging 1,000 percent interest. In rare instances, lenders charged 1,000 percent annual interest, but payday loan rates then averaged 465 percent.   For this fact check, we gauged whether Abbott piled up hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations and then issued a ruling favorable to payday lenders, which offer low-dollar, high-interest short-term loans targeting low-income people who live paycheck to paycheck. The loans are generally for $100 and $500 and are most often issued for two weeks. They’re considered risky because low-income borrowers are relatively unlikely to be able to pay them back. Abbott campaign contributions To our inquiry about the $300,000 described as given to Abbott, Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas emailed us records of Abbott campaign contributions as filed in campaign reports at the Texas Ethics Commission covering Sept. 16, 2002 nearly through July 2014. Our own sampling of state records showed Abbott’s campaign fielded: --$80,000 from Trevor Ahlberg, CEO of Irving-based payday lender Cash Store, in eight  installments from Aug. 16, 2006 to June 16, 2014; --$57,500 from Roderick Aycox, founder of Georgia-based payday lender LoanMax, in five installments from Nov. 12, 2009 to June 9, 2014; --$30,500 from Cash America International Inc. PAC in 14 contributions from Sept. 16, 2002 to July 29, 2014;  --$30,000 from Ace Cash Express Inc. PAC, in eight donations from Oct. 5, 2005 to July 29, 2014. Then again, according to Petkanas and state records, less than 5 percent of the tallied payday-lender donations, or $13,000, had come in by Jan. 12, 2006, which was the date Abbott’s office issued the ruling criticized by Davis. By phone, Petkanas said Davis did not mean to say in the debate that all the $300,000 was given before Abbott’s office ruled on payday lending. Texas Payday Lenders: Regulation and Evasion There's a lot of background to state actions involving payday lenders. In 1999, then-Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, Abbott’s predecessor, filed lawsuits against selected payday lenders, saying the companies were dodging state laws regulating interest rates. Separately, a ""usury"" provision in the Texas Constitution caps interest rates on short-term loans from unlicensed lenders at 10 percent. Cornyn, saying lenders were getting away with interest rates of up to 1,000 percent, said: ""This kind of abusive payday lending is illegal in Texas, and those companies who continue this practice will face serious consequences."" An October 2000 report by the Sunset Advisory Commission found that ""in recent years, different types of lending businesses have attempted to evade regulation"" including payday lenders. It recommended the Legislature ""authorize"" the ""Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner to regulate payday loans"" in order to ""help control unlawful interest rates."" In 2001, state lawmakers agreed to changes in law bringing payday lending under the office’s regulation and directing the Texas Finance Commission to adopt rules guiding the industry. According to a May 2001 bill analysis by the House Research Organization, the requested rules ""would prohibit a lender from using a device, pretense, or subterfuge to avoid regulation of the lender’s transactions, including by recharacterizing fees on a loan as a purchase of a good or service."" Resulting additions to Texas law include a chart specifying acceptable fees for payday loans of various dollar amounts and durations. But in subsequent years, according to Austin American-Statesman news reports, Texas payday lenders found a way around the law by partnering with out-of-state banks, which financed payday loans out of the reach of Texas laws. State and national legislators then raised concerns about payday lenders dodging the restrictions; the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation cracked down in 2005, limiting the number of payday loans a bank could issue and constricting the profitability of partnerships between payday lenders and banks. That’s when Texas payday lenders, under pressure from regulation, started transitioning to a new business model, called a credit service organization (CSO) in summer 2005, the Statesman reported In January 2006. Its news story said Texas payday lenders ditched partnerships with FDIC-regulated banks and began working with ""third-party unregistered lenders."" It also said Texas ""payday lenders got a boost recently from Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott"" in the form of a letter affirming the legality of the CSO model. Between 2004 and 2014, payday lender storefronts increased more than tenfold in Texas, the El Paso Times reported Feb. 4, 2014. Abbott’s interpretation of state law Next, we looked at the Abbott ""ruling"" declared by Davis. It turned out to be an aide's legal analysis. In 2005, the attorney general’s office, headed by Abbott, fielded two requests to review the legality of payday-lender CSOs, agency spokesman Jerry Strickland said by email, one an August 2005 verbal request from the consumer credit commissioner, who inquired after a court case raised questions about whether the state had any sway over CSOs. In Lovick v. Ritemoney Ltd., the plaintiff accused payday lender Ritemoney Ltd. of disguising illegal interest fees as service charges. A state district judge, Rhesa Hawkins Barksdale, wrote that ""Texas law does not construe such credit service fees as disguised interest,"" and the complaint was dismissed. Strickland said the other request for Abbott’s judgment came in writing Sept. 8, 2005 from then-state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso. Shapleigh wrote that as a CSO, ""a payday lending company dodges both federal guidelines restricting payday loans and the interest-rate limits established by the Texas Finance Commission. As the state’s leading enforcement agency, it is imperative that your office investigate this new business model and take necessary enforcement actions against businesses purposefully and illegally skirting Texas laws."" On Jan. 12, 2006, Barry McBee, the state’s first assistant attorney general, signed a letter responding to the commissioner, Leslie Pettijohn, saying there was ""nothing patently illegal"" about payday lender CSOs under state law and there was no statutory limit to the fees they could charge. McBee’s letter pointed out that, in keeping with state law, payday lender CSOs were charging the maximum-permitted 10 percent interest on loans plus service fees to arrange the loan between a borrower and third-party lender. He wrote that, according to Chapter 393 of the Texas Finance Code, there is not ""any limit on the amount of fees"" a CSO can charge in such transactions. ""Any discussion of whether the use of this model is the best public policy choice for the State of Texas,"" McBee wrote, ""is one that must be addressed by the Legislature and has not been explored by this office."" Legislative Review In the 2013 legislative session, lawmakers debated reforming payday lending practices, but attempts stalled. Expert Analysis  By phone, Don Baylor, a former senior policy analyst for the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving low-income Texans, said that after the Lovick v. Ritemoney ruling, payday lenders remained uncertain if they could legally operate as CSOs. But, Baylor said, ""it’s fair to say the OAG letter provided enough regulatory certainty for the entire (payday lending) industry to jump on board with the CSO model."" Baylor also said that after the Lovick ruling, ""the attorney general doesn’t have the authority to prohibit loans from being made under the CSO model."" He credited the explosion of payday lender CSOs to ambiguous wording in the 1987 Credit Services Organization Act, which was written to help Texans improve credit scores and not with payday lenders in mind, he said. ""Payday lenders found the CSO costume and dressed up in the costume,"" said Baylor. ""It’s a very creative way they came up with to get around the constitutional usury limits."" Our Ruling Davis said payday lenders gave Abbott $300,000 in campaign donations ""and then received a ruling from him that they can operate in a loophole in the law that allows them to charge unlimited rates and fees."" This statement references a 2006 legal analysis -- not a ruling -- from a top state aide to Abbott that tracked with a court ruling permitting payday lenders to charge unlimited fees in spite of state caps on related interest. Clarification is needed in that only 5 percent of the described $300,000 in donations occurred before the analysis was issued. Regardless, Abbott's office reaffirmed a way for politically supportive payday lenders to squeeze Texas borrowers. We rate this statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

"['National', 'Ebola', 'Public Health', 'Transportation', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama says you can't get Ebola from riding on a bus or plane
","President Barack Obama has sought to assuage fears about Ebola in the face of panic and misinformation. In his Oct. 18 weekly address, he called on people to ""be guided by the science and ""remember the basic facts."" ""Ebola is actually a difficult disease to catch,"" Obama said. ""It's not transmitted through the air like the flu. You cannot get it from just riding on a plane or a bus."" That last line, repeated often by the administration in various forms, has caught the ire of critics, who believe the statement is too cavalier. It’s also at odds with some advice from health officials that people who may have been exposed to the virus should avoid public transportation. So we decided to take a look at it ourselves: Can you get Ebola from ""just riding"" on a plane or a bus? As Thomas Fekete, a professor of infectious diseases at the Temple University School of Medicine, told us, ""There is no ‘infection free’ zone just because you're on a bus or a plane."" However, Fekete and others said the likelihood that someone would contract Ebola while flying or using public transportation is small. Extremely small. It would take a lot more than just sitting next to or sharing air with an infected individual. Let’s explain. How Ebola spreads People infected with the virus are not contagious until they are showing symptoms, according to experts and research. Symptoms are, first, a fever, followed by vomiting and diarrhea, which usually occurs between 2 and 21 days of contracting the virus. Risk of contracting Ebola is greatest if you come in direct contact with ""blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people,"" according to the World Health Organization. These fluids contain high concentrations of the virus that can result in infection if they are exposed to your eyes, mouth, nose or a cut on your skin, even for a relatively short amount of time. There is also some risk, albeit low, that the virus can be spread by ""being within approximately 3 feet of an (Ebola) patient or within the patient’s room or care area for a prolonged period of time,"" or by touching surfaces contaminated by bodily fluids of an infected patient. However, there is little evidence to date that Ebola spreads this way. Studies from previous Ebola outbreaks show that ""all cases were infected by direct close contact with symptomatic patients,"" the World Health Organization noted. What the government says Some critics say that Obama and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are sending mixed signals about the virus. While Obama says you can’t simply catch it from riding on a plane or bus, the CDC at the same time has cautioned people experiencing symptoms to ""limit your contact with other people"" and ""avoid public transportation."" The CDC also advises people who may have been exposed to the Ebola virus to remain in controlled movement, which means, in part, ""These individuals should not travel by commercial conveyances (e.g. airplane, ship, long-distance bus, or train)."" CDC director Tom Frieden recently addressed this on a conference call with reporters: ""I think there are two different parts of that equation. The first is, if you're a member of the traveling public and are healthy, should you be worried that you might have gotten it by sitting next to someone? The answer is no. Second, if you're sick, and you may have Ebola, should you get on a bus? The answer to that is also no. You might become ill; you might have a problem that exposes someone around you. Because the risk is so low, we think there is an extremely low likelihood that anyone who travelled on this plane would have been exposed, but we're putting into place extra margins of safety and that's why we're contacting everyone who was on that flight."" Experts told us this appears to be a case of the CDC taking extra precautions to be safe. ""The risk comes from the direct contact with the human secretions and is greatest in the hospital when the secretions are heavily contaminated with lots of viable virus or in an intimate home setting for the person in the earliest stage of illness when no one thinks to take any precautions because it seems like a ‘regular’ illness,"" Fekete said. ""But none of these things describe what happens on bus or plane rides."" Planes, trains and automobiles So how might someone get Ebola from riding on a bus or train? Ebola is not airborne. So you would have to be in close proximity to someone who is infected with Ebola and at least has a fever. On top of that, you would have to come in direct contact with bodily fluids from the infected individual. The most realistic scenario we could think of is someone sitting next to you is really sick and throws up on you. It’s an upsetting situation, to be sure, and without thinking you touch your nose or your eyes before you’re fully disinfected. However, people who are sick enough to be vomiting are also very unlikely to be in a state where they can take public transportation or fly, said Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. That’s why so far the only individuals who have contracted Ebola in the United States have been health care workers. ""The thing about Ebola is that at the point that you’re really infectious to other people is when you are in the later stages of your illness, when you have really terrible diarrhea and nonstop vomiting,"" Rimoin said. ""And nobody is going to be in contact with somebody who has Ebola at that stage under any kind of normal situation."" What about a sneeze or cough? Stephen Gire, a researcher at the Harvard Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology who studies the Ebola genome, said if someone who is showing symptoms sneezed directly on you from within 3 feet, it could, technically, transfer the virus. But people further away wouldn’t have to worry about those particles lingering in the air. We should add coughing and sneezing are not symptoms of Ebola and there’s no documented evidence the disease has ever been transmitted this way. What if bodily fluids from an infected individual ended up on a bus seat or a plane armrest? Could you get the Ebola virus that way? Under very limited conditions the virus could survive outside the body, Gire said. First, the fluid would have to remain in liquid form. Once it dried up, the virus would die. Second, it would have to be a very cool and dark setting. ""It has to be a highly engineered environment for Ebola to survive in this environment,"" Gire said. ""Stable temperature; on the right type of surface; not exposed to light, etc. These are highly, highly unlikely scenarios in nature and normal environments, and should not be seen as something that is likely to happen."" Our ruling Obama said, ""You cannot get (Ebola) from just riding on a plane or a bus."" He’s right in the sense that you can’t get it ""just"" from being on a plane or bus with someone who is infected. It would take additional steps: The infected person must be showing symptoms and you must have direct contact with that individual’s bodily fluids, i.e. blood or vomit. Could that happen? Hypothetically, sure. Experts confirmed as much, and the CDC goes so far as to warn people exposed to the virus that they should not take public transportation.

Is Florida spending $350 million to deal with sea-level rise?
","Gov. Rick Scott has drawn criticism from environmentalists for denying in 2011 that man contributes to climate change and now dodging questions with the reply of ""I’m not a scientist."" The topic arose during the Oct. 21 CNN debate when moderator Jake Tapper asked Gov. Rick Scott why he was ""reluctant to believe the overwhelming majority of scientists who say that man contributes to climate change."" Instead of answering the question directly, Scott claimed that he had already taken action to protect the environment, including addressing sea-level rise. ""We have spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise down in the Keys, or down in the Miami area. We spent hundreds of millions of dollars to deal with coral reefs,"" he said. Scott made a similar claim in the debate at Broward College on Oct. 15. Scott’s claim, particularly about investing in projects to combat sea-level rise, stood out for us. Under Scott, has the state spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise in the Miami area and hundreds of millions to protect coral reefs? Did Scott invest hundreds of millions to help coral reefs? We asked a Scott campaign spokeswoman to provide details about the spending for both projects. As for the coral reefs, Jackie Schutz told PolitiFact that the state had ""$100 million spent on protecting the Keys."" The money stemmed from a mandate by the state for the Keys to upgrade from cesspits and septic tanks to a modern sewer system. Improving water quality can help coral reefs. In 1999 when Jeb Bush was governor, the state required that the Keys comply with wastewater standards that would necessitate modern sewer by 2010. That deadline would later be extended to 2015. To meet that goal, when Charlie Crist, was governor the Legislature approved a bill in 2008 that allowed bonding of $50 million a year for four years for the wastewater program. The bill stated that ""beginning July 1, 2010, the Legislature shall analyze the ratio of the state's debt to projected revenues prior to the authorization to issue any bonds under this section."" No money was actually doled out during the Crist administration, which coincided with the recession. Scott took over as governor in 2011. The first year that the state doled out money was in 2012. But the next year Scott, along with legislative leaders, decided not to issue bonds due to concerns about the state’s debt capacity, according to an article in the Florida Keys Keynoter. In 2014, the state doled out the second $50 million. In August 2014, Scott’s campaign released a ""Let’s Keep Florida Beautiful Plan,"" which included a promise to invest another $100 million in the Keys wastewater project. So how does the sewer system relate to coral reefs? Centralized wastewater treatment prevents nutrients and other pollutants from entering nearshore waters, said Chris Bergh of The Nature Conservancy in the Keys. Wastewater treatment kills bacteria from human waste that can cause coral disease. ""It was a great boon to the Keys environment and residents, but it will not affect sea-level rise in any but the most tangential ways,"" Bergh said. Sea-level rise money A spokesman for Scott’s office, John Tupps, sent us a list of what he said amounted to over $350 million ""to address flood mitigation and sea-level rise."" The projects were administered by various state agencies and included the following, in addition to the $100 million for sewer in the Keys: • $21 million for FEMA flood map modernization; • $122 beach protection projects; • $5 million for the coastal zone management program; • $80 million for flood mitigation in Florida in coastal communities; • $25 million for the Keys wastewater revolving loan program projects. The first thing we will point out is to get to $350 million Scott counted $100 million to install a sewer system in the Keys even though the point of that project wasn’t to deal with sea-level rise. We asked environmental experts if these additional projects should be considered as steps toward combating sea-level rise. They told us that while these projects have their merits, they aren’t long-term solutions to sea-level rise. For example, better flood maps help identify properties that are vulnerable under today’s conditions to flooding, but they don’t deal with future sea-level rise, Bergh said.  These are typical beach maintenance and flooding-related projects. Scott hasn’t taken steps that scientists say would address future sea-level rise such as reducing coal-fired power plants. Florida State University oceanography professor Jeff Chanton said that if the beach protection projects refer to pumping sand onto the beach, that is an ""ineffective short-term temporary fix."" Chanton was one of the scientists who met with Scott this summer and urged him to take action on climate change. The scientists showed Scott how two feet of sea-level rise -- projected by 2048 -- will swallow much of Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. They called on Scott to reduce or eliminate coal-fired power plants; wean the state off carbon-emitting natural gas and oil-fired power; and develop more alternative energy options. The scientists noted that sea-level rise has already caused flooding in Miami Beach at high tide. We also sought out several government officials in Broward and Miami-Dade counties as well as the cities of Miami and Miami Beach to see if they had received state money to combat sea-level rise. No one could pinpoint a specific project. ""I have no idea what he's talking about. It's the first I've heard of it,"" said Monroe County Commissioner Heather Carruthers, who serves on the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, in an interview with the Florida Keys Keynoter. Our ruling Scott said during the CNN debate, ""We have spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise"" in the Miami area and ""hundreds of millions dollars to deal with coral reefs."" The state has spent $100 million to help the Keys upgrade to a sewer system, which should improve water quality -- a benefit for coral reefs. Scott omits that it was under Crist that the Legislature passed a law paving the way for the money, and he's wrong to claim it's ""hundreds of millions."" Scott’s office also pointed to a list of projects including flood mitigation, flood maps and beach protection -- and throws in the $100 million for the sewer project -- to make his claim about $350 million to deal with sea-level rise. While these include worthy projects, experts say they aren't directly related to addressing future sea-level rise. They’re typical projects for Florida, not new measures to address climate change. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB80E600>],/factchecks/2014/oct/29/rick-scott/florida-spending-350-million-deal-sea-level-rise/
"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says September job growth is largest September increase in over a decade
","When the state’s monthly jobs report was issued a few weeks before the Nov. 4, 2014 election, it received more attention than usual from Gov. Scott Walker. With jobs and the economy a key focus in the tight race between Walker and Democratic challenger Mary Burke, the governor touted a report that said the state had added an estimated 8,400 jobs in September. A day after the numbers came out, and hours before his second debate with Burke, Waker told the League of Wisconsin Municipalities in an Oct. 17, 2014 speech: ""Yesterday at noon, the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development announced that our labor numbers, the numbers of jobs created in the private sector last month, for September, was 8,400 -- 8,400 new private-sector jobs were created in the state of Wisconsin last month."" He continued with a claim we want to check: ""That's the largest private-sector job creation we've had in the month of September in more than a decade. In more than a decade."" In the days since, Walker has repeated the claim many times. Is he right? Tallying jobs The September jobs report is a preliminary one. It is extrapolated from a monthly survey of 3.5 percent of state employers by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. As such, the monthly numbers have a large margin of error and can swing widely when they are made final. This batch, for instance, has a margin of error of 7,980. The numbers can even change again later, when much more accurate quarterly numbers -- based on a census of nearly every state employer -- can be used to adjust monthly numbers. Nevertheless, the numbers are the most recent ones available. When we asked Walker’s campaign for backup, spokeswoman Alleigh Marre simply made the point they are the most recent month numbers and noted the numbers are widely reported each month. When we looked at a decade of Bureau of Labor Statistics data, September 2014 did come out on top: 2005: 2,000 2006: 1,200 2007: -3,700 2008: -8,700 2009: 400 2010: -3,200 2011: 4,400 2012: 6,400 2013: 1,300 2014: 8,400 The next-largest job gain for that time frame was an addition of 6,400 jobs in September 2012. The pendulum swung the other way in 2008, during the worst stretch of the economic downturn, when there were 8,700 jobs lost in that single month. To be sure, the September 2014 numbers are preliminary and the ones for previous years are final. So, there is a bit of apples-oranges going on in the comparison. But when when we rated Mostly True a Walker claim on how Wisconsin compares to Midwestern states for job growth over the past year, a federal BLS official told us it was reasonable to compare the preliminary number with a prior year, with the understanding the new number is not final. In that claim, Walker had compared preliminary July numbers from 2014 with final July numbers from 2013. That comparison showed the state ranked third in the Midwest. Of course, we can’t predict what the revised September jobs figure will be when the next round of data comes out in November 2014. But if it’s revised down by 2,000 or more jobs, then this would not be the best September in 10 years. Again, that best-in-Midwest growth claim is instructive. When the final numbers came out, the ranking fell from third to fourth. (And Walker revised his talking point.) In any case, we can only rate a claim based on what is known at the time it is made. And this one holds up, even by another measure. We also dug out the preliminary September reports for past years, so we could see how preliminary numbers for September 2014 compare to preliminary numbers for previous Septembers (We’re kinda geeky that way). The records for 2013 were complicated because of the federal government shut down and the comparable data for before 2009 wasn’t available. But the preliminary tally of 8,400 jobs in 2014 topped 2012 ( increase of 1,500), 2011 (decrease of 900) and 2010 (decrease of 9,900). Past use of the numbers Close readers will note that Walker has had a decidedly love-hate-love relationship with the monthly numbers, at times embracing them and at times dismissing them. In December 2011, Workforce Development Secretary Reggie Newson described the numbers this way: ""These unreliable employment statistics out of Washington misinform the public and create unnecessary anxiety for job seekers and job creators about the shape of our state’s economy."" Instead, state officials -- including Walker -- began to stress the more accurate quarterly numbers. Until the campaign season, when monthly numbers were back in vogue. We have even put Walker’s views on the numbers on the Flip-O-Meter, and rated them a Full Flop. But here we are simply rating what Walker said; the Truth-O-Meter does not have a hypocrisy setting. Our rating Walker claims that the September report which showed an increase of 8,400 jobs was the best in the past 10 years for that month. That stacks up. And a BLS official says the approach is legitimate, with the caveat the latest year is preliminary. Thus, we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBC7180>],/factchecks/2014/oct/29/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-september-job-growth-largest-sep/

Ernest Almonte claims Seth Magaziner, as treasurer, plans to spend billions in taxpayer money
","In a television ad for Ernest Almonte, independent candidate for treasurer, his campaign tries to compare him and Democrat Seth Magaziner in categories such as fiscal efficiency, protecting employee pensions, and political ties. At one point the narrator says, ""Ernie Almonte is an independent who isn't tied to any party and is ready to save tax dollars. Seth Magaziner -- a partisan politician with plans to spend billions more of your money."" Billions? That's quite a claim when the current state budget is $8.7 billion. When we contacted the Almonte campaign to ask what the ""billions"" claim was referring to, spokeswoman Christine Hunsinger sent a tally of five items that totaled just over $2 billion. It turns out that virtually all of that $2 billion is hypothetical. In essence, Almonte takes Magaziner’s proposals -- which notably lack specific cost estimates -- and extrapolated his own estimates, taking each to the extreme. He assumes that Magaziner plans to finance every school, infrastructure and historic preservation project the state has suggested. And he assumes that Magaziner would serve a full eight years, magnifying the potential costs. Almonte bases the calculation on Magaziner's website document ""A Blueprint for Rhode Island,"" which offers several proposals to spur economic growth in the state. We'll consider the five items separately. Main Street Opportunity Loan Program -- Almonte notes that Magaziner is promising to advocate for $20 million for this loan program for people looking to start a business. Magaziner's campaign counters that it would only cost the state $20 million if every single loan defaults immediately. But, in fact, the state would still be paying $20 million up front to make the loans in the first place. Actual cost to taxpayers: $20 million, as Almonte says. Rhode Island Venture Pool -- Almonte says Magaziner is calling for investing $15 million from the state's pension fund into a venture capital program that focuses exclusively on new Rhode Island businesses. The goal is to create jobs. But the program would cost $15 million only if the entire amount is loaned and the companies pay none of it back. Almonte says it’s reasonable to assume the full amount because investments in new companies carry a high risk. Actual cost to taxpayers: Nothing immediately. With bad investments -- up to $15 million. Or it might make money. School Building Capital Improvement Authority -- Magaziner says in his plan that he wants to rebuild or renovate Rhode Island's schools using a School Building Capital Improvement Authority. His blueprint mentions no price tag, but says it would be modeled after a successful program in Massachusetts, where 1 penny of the 6.25-percent sales tax goes to school construction and improvement. Almonte says that if Rhode Island were to divert a penny when it collects its 7-percent sales tax, that would raise about $127 million a year. But the state would have to find a way to make up for that lost sales tax money, so it would be an extra burden on the taxpayer. Almonte estimates the total cost of the proposal would be more than $1 billion -- $127 million per year times the eight years Magaziner could potentially be in office. But Evan England, campaign manager for Magaziner, said the candidate has not specified how much of the sales tax should be tapped and is simply proposing that some portion of existing state revenue be earmarked for school construction. Actual cost to taxpayers: It depends on how the program is set up and how ambitious it tries to be. Infrastructure Bank -- Magaziner proposes a revolving fund for roads and bridges similar to one in Virginia that offers bonds and loans to communities at low-interest rates. Again, he doesn’t specify a dollar figure. Almonte, however, says it would cost $430 million over several years. He derives that number from a 2013 General Assembly staff report that said Rhode Island needs to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on its biggest infrastructure projects over five years. Magaziner's campaign manager said the assumption that the bank would fund every proposed infrastructure project ""is completely out of left field and does not appear anywhere in the Blueprint."" Actual cost to taxpayers: Once again, it would vary by how the program is set up and how ambitious it is. Historic Preservation Tax Credit Trust -- Magaziner's blueprint promises to ""push to restore"" the program, which had been capped to trim costs. Once again, Magaziner doesn't cite a cost. Almonte says the program will cost $460 million, a figure he derived by assuming that all 277 projects cited in a 2007 report would be funded. England's response: ""Seth has said numerous times that the tax credits should exist, but that the level and the cap should be fluid and responsive to the needs of the economy for that given year,"" Actual cost to taxpayers: It depends on how many projects actually are awarded tax credits. Our ruling Ernest Almonte said Seth Magaziner ""plans to spend billions more of your money."" Almonte is referring to Magaziner’s Blueprint for Rhode Island, which outlines a series of economic development proposals. If any were implemented, there would certainly be a cost, but the lack of specifics in the blueprint make it impossible to calculate. Almonte told PolitiFact Rhode Island that he is simply doing what a good general treasurer should do -- evaluate proposals and offer realistic estimates about what they would cost. He said the total eventual price tag could be more than $2 billion. But extrapolating worst-case costs from vaguely defined programs, piling assumption onto assumption and extending them over several years is not realistic at all. Because the statement contains some elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it False.

Viral meme says 1956 Republican platform was pretty liberal
","Liberals are getting nostalgic about the 1950s Republican agenda -- at least judging by the social media meme several readers recently sent us. The meme, created by the group Occupy Democrats, summarized a few planks from the 1956 Republican Party platform, followed by the wistful comment, ""Share if you miss the good old days!"" Here are the seven planks listed in the meme, which to today’s ear sound more like Democratic talking points: 1. Provide federal assistance to low-income communities; 2. Protect Social Security; 3. Provide asylum for refugees; 4. Extend minimum wage; 5. Improve unemployment benefit system so it covers more people; 6. Strengthen labor laws so workers can more easily join a union; 7. Assure equal pay for equal work regardless of sex. We wondered whether the meme accurately describes these elements of the 1956 platform, and if so, whether the 1956 document contrasts sharply with the most recent party platform in 2012. So we took a closer look. What the 1956 platform said We located a copy of the official party platform from 1956, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was running (successfully, as it turned out) for his second term as president. All told, the meme is generally accurate in portraying these seven elements of the 1956 platform, with some caveats. On federal assistance to low-income communities, the 1956 platform said the party would ""promote fully the Republican-sponsored Rural Development Program to broaden the operation and increase the income of low income farm families and help tenant farmers."" On protecting Social Security, the platform touted the Eisenhower administration’s extension of Social Security to 10 million more workers and benefits hikes for 6.5 million Americans. On refugees, the platform spotlighted the administration’s work in sponsoring the Refugee Relief Act ""to provide asylum for thousands of refugees, expellees and displaced persons,"" promising its ""wholehearted support"" for additional efforts. M. Christine Anderson, a Xavier University historian, noted that many refugees were coming from communist countries in Eastern Europe, so this wasn't an especially controversial issue during the Cold War era. On the minimum wage, the platform notes that the Eisenhower administration raised the minimum wage for more than 2 million workers. It urged extending minimum-wage protections ""to as many more workers as is possible and practicable."" On improving the unemployment benefit system, the 1956 platform touted the administration’s actions to bring unemployment insurance to 4 million additional workers, and backed efforts to ""improve the effectiveness of the unemployment insurance system."" On strengthening unions, the platform says the ""protection of the right of workers to organize into unions and to bargain collectively is the firm and permanent policy of the Eisenhower Administration."" That’s full-throated rhetoric in support of unions -- but the policy reality is a bit more nuanced, said Jennifer Delton, a Skidmore College historian and author of Rethinking the 1950s. The platform did not support unions’ key agenda item that year -- a repeal of states’ ability to pass ""right to work"" laws that would ban compulsory union membership. On equal pay for equal work regardless of sex, the platform says the Eisenhower administration will ""continue to fight … (to) assure equal pay for equal work regardless of sex."" What the 2012 platform says The party’s 2012 platform is pretty different, both in tone and substance. On federal assistance to low-income communities, the 2012 platform takes a much more skeptical view. ""The federal government’s entire system of public assistance should be reformed to ensure that it promotes work,"" the 2012 platform says, arguing that the system has become overly bureaucratized and discourages work. The 2012 platform also takes a shot at federal low-income housing policy, saying the government ""has spent billions more on poorly designed and ineffective housing assistance programs."" On Social Security, the platform says current retirees or those approaching retirement should continue to receive Social Security as currently configured. However, it goes on to say that demographic and financial challenges mean that the program is ""long overdue for major change, not just another legislative stopgap that postpones a day of reckoning,"" including the possibility of ""personal investment accounts as supplements to the system."" The 2012 platform doesn’t address refugees specifically, but it does address immigration. It criticizes President Barack Obama for creating ""a backdoor amnesty program unrecognized in law (and) granting worker authorization to illegal aliens."" It also says that ""granting amnesty only rewards and encourages more law-breaking,"" and it promises to ""create humane procedures to encourage illegal aliens to return home voluntarily, while enforcing the law against those who overstay their visas."" The 2012 platform doesn’t mention the minimum wage specifically, but it does place an emphasis on free-market business practices rather than government regulation of labor markets, laying the blame for the nation’s weak economic recovery on ""unprecedented uncertainty in the American free enterprise system due to the overreaching policies of the current administration."" Even accounting for the nuances of the 1956 platform, the clearest contrast between the two platforms may be in their approach to labor unions. The 2012 platform offers no rhetorical niceties, accusing the Obama administration of ""clinging to antiquated notions of confrontation and concentrating power in the Washington offices of union elites"" and of turning the National Labor Relations Board into ""a partisan advocate for Big Labor, using threats and coercion outside the law to attack businesses."" The 2012 platform doesn’t mention two of the meme’s seven items from 1956 -- unemployment benefits and equal pay for women. The bottom line, then, is that on most of these issues, the GOP moved to the right between 1956 and 2012, though the degree of that shift has varied somewhat issue by issue. What historians say We asked scholars whether the contrast between the two platforms is noteworthy, and they generally agreed that it was. Delton noted that the Republican Party in the 1950s was divided between moderates (including Eisenhower) and conservatives. She said the moderates controlled the process of platform-writing in 1956, but they threw a few bones to conservatives in certain portions of the document. For instance, the platform said the government wouldn’t sign a treaty or enter into an international agreement in violation of individual rights -- an issue that continues to energize conservatives decades later -- and there’s a plank about a balanced budget, which was seen as a conservative position. The seven items listed in the meme were supported by moderates, Delton said. At the time, she said, ""conservatives would have focused, with horror, on the very items the meme highlights."" Eisenhower was facing a Democratic Congress in 1956 and didn’t want to try to reverse the New Deal, Anderson said. ""If the point is that Eisenhower was not as extreme as Republicans today, it is accurate."" Our ruling The meme says the 1956 Republican Party platform supported equal pay, the minimum wage, asylum for refugees, protections for unions and more. That’s generally correct. However, it’s worth noting that other elements of the 1956 platform were considered conservative for that era. Also, some of the issues have changed considerably between 1956 and 2012, such as the shift from focusing on post-war refugees to focusing on illegal immigration. The claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD92440>],/factchecks/2014/oct/28/facebook-posts/viral-meme-says-1956-republican-platform-was-prett/

Charlie Crist attacks Rick Scott's rape crisis center veto
","In the homestretch, Charlie Crist is pushing hard for the women’s vote in his battle against Gov. Rick Scott. Crist has vowed to protect abortion rights and fight for equal pay for women for months. Scott has attacked Crist for taking money from strip club owners. Now a TV ad attacks Scott’s record on funding rape crisis centers. ""No one saw it coming. With the stroke of a pen, Rick Scott vetoed funding for 30 Florida rape crisis centers. Scott said the centers weren't needed. But they’ve helped over a million Florida women who’ve been sexually assaulted get care, counseling and legal help. These centers were a place for women who have nowhere else to turn. And Rick Scott turned his back on every single one of them."" (Technically the Florida Democratic Party released the ad, but the Crist campaign has promoted it.) The ad leaves viewers with the impression that Scott completely rejected funding for rape crisis centers, a serious attack against the governor. Did Scott veto funding for 30 rape crisis centers and say that the centers weren’t needed? Scott’s veto The state funds rape crisis centers through various pots of money. A portion comes from the Rape Crisis Trust Fund, which comes from fines assessed on felony criminal defendants. Additionally, some money comes from the Attorney General’s Office, and in some years the Legislature and governor approved additional money. In the fine print, the ad cites a TV report from April 2012. In 2012, Scott vetoed $1.5 million of additional money for the rape crisis centers. The 30 centers still received $1.4 million from the Trust Fund and $500,000 from the attorney general. The Florida Council Against Sexual Violence, which lobbies on behalf of the centers, issued a statement criticizing the veto, ""especially when the need for increased funding is so clear, waiting lists for core services are growing, and programs can’t meet the needs of those whose lives have been devastated by sexual violence."" Scott’s veto during Sexual Assault Awareness Month drew much scrutiny -- especially in left-leaning websites. The TV ad says ""Scott said the centers weren’t needed"" but that’s not actually a reference to a direct quote by Scott. We found no statement by Scott to suggest he thought the centers were unnecessary -- only that he thought the new funding wasn’t necessary. The Crist campaign points to a statement by Scott’s spokesman at the time, Lane Wright, who told the Huffington Post, ""This new funding of $1.5 million would have been duplicative, since, as a state, we already fund sexual violence programs. There was no information suggesting any needs in this area weren’t already being met."" Scott, while attending an event for Crime Victims Rights Week, said he thought the centers were adequately funded, not that they were unnecessary. ""We have increased funding for domestic violence. We have money that goes into rape crisis centers already,"" Scott said, according to a column in the Palm Beach Post. ""So it was additional money that was already funded."" Scott later recommended an increase in funding There’s more to the story, though. Advocates for the rape crisis centers met with state staff after the veto, and the next year Scott recommended additional money. ""There were a number of people in the Legislature who spoke with the governor’s office about the need, and in 2013, there it was in his recommended budget,"" said Jennifer Dritt, director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violent, who spoke with PolitiFact Florida in September. ""We were never in any governor’s recommendation for funding until Gov. Scott recommended $2.5 million in 2013."" Scott highlighted his funding boost for rape crisis centers in a 2013 press release, which included praise by Dritt:   ""This appropriation will make a world of difference in the lives of Florida’s citizens, and we’re grateful for his commitment,"" Dritt said. The increase in money allowed some centers to hire additional staff which helped reduce waiting lists and expand services, Dritt told PolitiFact Florida. Under Scott, the $2.5 million remained in the budget for a second year in a row in 2014. Based on our interviews with women’s advocates and state officials in September, here is the amount of state dollars that went to rape crisis centers statewide under Crist and Scott: Legislative session Money from state AG (usually from general revenue) Other general revenue Trust Fund Total 2007-Crist $400,000 0 $1.5 million $1.9 million 2008-Crist $400,000 0 $2 million $2.4 million 2009-Crist $250,000 0 $2 million $2.25 million 2010-Crist $250,000 0 $1.8 million $2.05 million 2011-Scott $250,000 0 $1.8 million $2.05 million 2012-Scott $500,000 0 after Scott vetoed $1.5 million approved by Legislature $1.4 million $1.9 million 2013-Scott $500,000 $2.5 million $1.3 million $4.3 million 2014-Scott $500,000 $2.5 million $1.3 million $4.3 million Our ruling A TV ad on behalf of Crist said ""Rick Scott vetoed funding for 30 Florida rape crisis centers. Scott said the centers weren’t needed."" The ad omits that Scott vetoed an increase in funding for the centers in 2012. He never said the centers weren’t needed -- he said that particular extra $1.5 million wasn’t needed. The ad omits that in 2013 he supported a $2.5 million increase, which also remained in the budget in 2014. The ad overall is misleading because it fails to make it clear that funding for rape crisis centers increased under Scott's watch.

Mary Burke says Scott Walker deal lets company keep $6 million tax break even with big layoffs
","Before introducing former President Bill Clinton at an Oct. 24, 2014 campaign event in Milwaukee, Democrat Mary Burke leveled a number of criticisms at her election rival, Gov. Scott Walker. Including this one: ""He gave $6 million in tax breaks to a corporation and told them that they can keep that money even if they lay off half their workforce."" Typically, when the state offers financial assistance to a company, the company has to create jobs. So what’s going on here? The deal Burke was alluding to a deal offered by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. to Ashley Furniture Industries. WEDC is the state’s primary agency for helping businesses create jobs. Walker created it to replace the state Department of Commerce; he heads the WEDC board. Ashley Furniture, based in Arcadia in western Wisconsin, is the country's largest furniture manufacturer and retailer. The deal for the furniture company was reported in late-August 2014 by the Wisconsin State Journal. According to the Madison newspaper, the WEDC board in January 2014 approved a $6 million enterprise zone tax credit that would help Ashley Furniture with a $35 million expansion of its headquarters. More specifically, the $6 million would pay for the relocation of Meyers Valley Creek, which flooded downtown Arcadia and the Ashley plant in 2010, allowing for the company to launch a 480,000-square foot expansion to reconfigure and change the layout of production lines. The company, which the State Journal said had 3,848 Wisconsin employees at the time, did not have to commit to create a certain number of jobs. In fact, the credits would remain in place even if the company laid off as much as half of its workforce within the next several years. Quoting a memo to the WEDC board, the newspaper reported that Ashley Furniture had indicated ""that if the project is not undertaken, it will either downsize or close the Arcadia manufacturing plant completely."" So, based on what the company was telling the WEDC, the agency was motivated to try to stop the loss of many jobs. The tax credits deal had not been made public because WEDC had not finalized a contract with Ashley Furniture, although the company confirmed to the newspaper that it was seeking state subsidies that include terms allowing for job reductions. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel followed up on the story. Ashley confirmed that the deal would allow the tax credits to stand even if Ashley cut up to half its Wisconsin employment. But the company said it was advertising 200 job openings and had no plans to cut jobs in western Wisconsin. The company said the layoff provision was meant to cover a worst-case scenario -- protecting the company, for example, in case a disastrous fire or flood should force a shutdown and layoffs. Moreover, the deal amounts to a pass-through, rather than cash in Ashley’s pocket, given that the company would be donating $6 million to the City of Arcadia for the flood-control project. WEDC spokesman Mark Maley told us that the WEDC board has discussed giving the tax credits to Ashley for the flood-control project. He would not release details of the board’s closed-door meeting at which the credits were approved, saying there still is not yet a signed contract between the agency and the furniture maker. But he said: ""WEDC is committed to doing whatever it can to work with the company and preserve those jobs."" Our rating Burke said Walker ""gave $6 million in tax breaks to a corporation and told them that they can keep that money even if they lay off half their workforce."" Walker heads the board of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., and that board has approved $6 million in tax credits to aid an expansion of Ashley Furniture. The tax credits would be used toward a flood-control project in the city where the furniture maker is headquartered, but the project clearly is part of the company’s plan to expand. If Ashley did lay off half its workforce, the credits could still remain in place, but since they would be used for a flood-control project, it’s not as though the company could ""keep the money."" For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.

Carlson: Democrats use Newports to get out the homeless vote
","Lost in the spectacular turmoil over who took Florida in the 2000 presidential election was a kerfuffle in Milwaukee, Wis., over 10 packs of cigarettes and some homeless voters. Though it was never proven, the story goes that a few days before the polls opened, a New York Democratic activist gave men from the Milwaukee Rescue Mission cigarettes in exchange for their votes. Conservative pundit Tucker Carlson alluded to this episode during the banter on Fox News’ noontime show Outnumbered Oct. 2. ""I don't think as a general matter you should be encouraging people who don't know anything about what they're voting for to vote,"" Carlson said. ""That's what the Democrats do, giving Newports to the homeless to get them to the polls. That's literally true. Republicans shouldn't follow suit on that. You shouldn't pander to people."" A reader asked us to check whether there was any substance to Carlson’s dig at Democrats. The basic events in Milwaukee On the Saturday before the election on Nov. 7, 2000, Connie Milstein, a long-time Democratic donor from New York, was in Milwaukee. Milstein and some colleagues went to the mission and offered to give anyone who was interested a ride to City Hall to pick up an absentee ballot. About two dozen men took up the offer and at some point, 10 of them were given a pack of cigarettes each. We don’t know, however, if they were promised the cigarettes in advance or asked for a smoke afterwards and were treated to a full pack. And we don’t know if the promise of cigarettes was in exchange for a vote. In Wisconsin, it’s illegal to give a person anything worth more than $1 to induce them to vote. The cigarettes cost about $3.25 a pack. Republicans cried foul and pressed local prosecutors to file charges against Milstein. The Milwaukee County District Attorney’s office was reluctant, if only because it might have cost thousands of dollars to bring the case to trial. Months later, after an investigation, Assistant District Attorney Kurt Benkley said he didn’t think the evidence proved anyone was guilty. In May 2001, Milstein agreed to pay $5,000 in a civil forfeiture, a legal term that admitted no guilt and closed the case. Milstein’s lawyer Stephen Glynn told PunditFact that there was no evidence of a quid pro quo (a smoke for a vote). ""No one said that, ‘If I went to vote, I would receive cigarettes,’ "" Glynn said. Nonetheless, the campaign for Al Gore distanced itself from Milstein and released a statement right after the event happened saying her efforts were ""not the kind of help we ask for and it’s the kind of help we flat out reject."" We emailed Carlson and asked for any background he could provide for his statement. We did not hear back. We could find no other example of cigarettes being offered to voters. Why Newports? The oddest feature in Carlson’s statement is he specifically named Newport cigarettes. Benkley, the assistant district attorney, said he has no idea where that came from because the brand of cigarette had nothing to do with the case. ""Those facts would never have come into the public domain,"" Benkley said. And he added, ""I don’t recall the brand."" Bottom line: The Newport brand appears to be an invention. Our ruling Carlson said that Democrats give Newports to the homeless to get them to the polls. Based on the evidence, Carlson is citing an isolated case where authorities were unable to prove that votes were traded for cigarettes, or that the cigarettes were an enticement. On one occasion in Milwaukee, as many as three Democrats gave rides to homeless men to City Hall to cast absentee ballots. At some point, they gave some of the men cigarettes. There is no evidence that the cigarettes were Newports, and investigators did not find that the cigarettes were offered as an inducement to vote. Calson emphasized that his account was ""literally true,"" but by that standard, it is inaccurate on several points. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD92C80>],/factchecks/2014/oct/28/tucker-carlson/carlson-democrats-use-newports-get-out-homeless-vo/

Carter flips position on income cap for HOPE scholars
","Democratic state Sen. Jason Carter was adamant in 2011 that Gov. Nathan Deal was taking the wrong approach to saving HOPE, arguably the most popular state program ever created. The lottery-funded scholarship program was looking at potential bankruptcy. Deal, Georgia’s newly elected governor, proposed a series of changes to the program — the most significant being that full scholarships would go only to the best and brightest, students with a 3.7 grade-point average and 1200 SAT scores. Carter, however, championed an alternative in 2011 and 2012. His proposal would have set a so-called income cap on HOPE scholarships. The scholarships would go only to qualifying students from families with a household income of $140,000 or less. Opponents said that would put the program in equal financial peril, eliminating only 6 percent of all Georgia families. The proposed income caps resurfaced recently in the tight governor’s race between Carter and Deal. Republicans pounced with attack ads suggesting Carter ""wants to eliminate HOPE scholarships for thousands of middle-class families."" But then Carter appeared to change his approach on the income cap. At an education summit earlier this month, Carter said an income cap is ""probably too blunt an instrument."" The goal, he said, is to maximize the number of scholars and consider ""need without a full-fledged cap."" So has Carter flip-flopped on his position? We found an article from January indicating that Carter had changed from his original call for an income cap. He said he still wanted to push for some needs-based criteria for the HOPE scholarship. But he dismissed the idea of an income cap, calling it ""too blunt an instrument,"" the magazine reported. Carter spokesman Bryan Thomas said Carter first discussed abandoning the idea of an income cap with students at the University of Georgia about a year ago. Brian Robinson, a spokesman for Deal, said Carter was late to the game. ""It’s literally taken Jason Carter three and a half years to realize you ‘cannot pay for everybody’ — a conclusion that responsible Republicans and Democrats reached when they took courageous votes to save HOPE from bankruptcy."" We rate Carter’s change of heart on HOPE a Full Flop.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC92B440>],/factchecks/2014/oct/28/jason-carter/Carter/

Alaska's Don Young says suicide is linked to federal government largesse
","In mid October, long-serving Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, provoked a firestorm with a series of comments about suicide. It’s a significant issue in his home state: In recent years, Alaska has experienced suicide at roughly twice the national rate. The controversy began when Young spoke to more than 100 students and staff at Wasilla High School on Oct. 21, 2014, just days after a student at the school had committed suicide. Young, according to news reports, told an audience that suicide shows a lack of support from friends and family -- a claim that inspired an immediate negative response from some in the audience. ""A friend of the victim shouted to Young that a disease, depression, was at the root of suicide,"" the Alaska Dispatch News reported. ""Young bristled at the interruption and responded to the student with profanity."" Later that day, Young’s office released a statement saying the congressman should ""have taken a much more sensitive approach."" But Young doubled down in an event the next day, appearing before 100 people at a senior center. According a recording excerpted in the Dispatch News, Young told the group, ""When people had to work and had to provide and had to keep warm by putting participation in cutting wood and catching the fish and killing the animals, we didn’t have the suicide problem."" Suicide, he added, comes from federal government largesse ""saying you are not worth anything but you are going to get something for nothing."" We wondered: Is there proof that suicide in Alaska has been linked to receiving government payments? Before digging any deeper, we should note that Young’s office has since apologized for his comment. In a statement to PolitiFact on Oct. 23, Young’s office said he ""discussed what he believes are leading causes of youth suicide in our state, including the impact of drugs and alcohol, depression, a feeling of worthlessness, and a lack of support systems. Congressman Young did not mean to upset anyone with his well-intentioned message, and in light of the tragic events affecting the Wasilla High School community, he should have taken a much more sensitive approach. … Issues like suicide and domestic violence cannot be discussed in isolation or generalities. Each and every case is different, and should be addressed in that manner."" Then, a day later, in a speech to the Alaska Federation of Natives Convention, Young ""shared his sincere and honest apology"" and said the suicide of a nephew ""may have caused me to mangle some of my statements."" Still, since suicide is a significant problem in Alaska, we thought the substance of his original comment was worth a closer look. Explaining suicide in Alaska According to the state Department of Health and Social Services, the age-adjusted rate for suicide in Alaska between 2003 and 2010 was almost twice the national average. In 2010, suicide ranked as the sixth-leading cause of death in Alaska and the leading cause of death among persons aged 15–24 years. The main reason for Alaska’s high rate is the unusually high frequency of suicide among Alaska Natives -- that is, indigenous Alaskans. The suicide rate for rural Alaska Natives is three to four times higher than it is for Anglos, said Matthew D. Berman, an economist at the University of Alaska-Anchorage who has studied the issue. In a paper published earlier this year, Berman reported suicide data for Alaska Natives going back to 1950 (see chart below). The rate was basically flat from 1950 to the mid 1960s, then rose rapidly from the mid 1960s to the mid 1970s before falling again. The rate peaked in the late 1980s and has fallen slowly but consistently since then.  One problem with the connection Young pointed to is that the creation of the state’s biggest source of ""largesse"" -- the annual dividends paid to all Alaska residents from the proceeds of natural-resource extraction -- doesn’t track with the ups and downs of Alaska Native suicide rates. The Alaska Permanent Fund, as the resource-extraction fund is known, began paying dividends to residents in 1982, usually between several hundred dollars and $2,000 in a given year. Yet the growth in Alaska Native suicide predated those dividends, and the suicide trend since creation of the fund has generally been downward. ""This is a classic case of offering a simple answer to a really complicated problem,"" Berman said. ""When I have visited rural Alaska, I see people hauling firewood, fishing, and hunting for food. The rural cash economy depends heavily on government, but state spending plays a bigger role than federal these days, and most of the income comes from employment."" Moreover, researchers have found evidence that factors other than money tend to influence the rate of suicide in Alaska Native communities. Suicide tends to be lower among Alaska Natives who live in traditional ways, and among those who live in the larger, Anglo-dominant culture. Those who are are most susceptible to suicide are those who are firmly rooted in neither society, and perhaps transitioning between them. James Allen, a professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota, has found that older Alaska Natives, who tend to have a stronger connection to cultural traditions, are at lower risk of suicide. This tracks with data from other polar indigenous populations, such as the Sami people of Norway. Sami people who participate in the traditional pursuit of reindeer herding tend to have lower rates of suicide, according to Siv Kvernmo, a researcher at the University of Tromso. As for the second group with lower suicide rates -- Alaska Natives who have relocated from rural villages to urban centers -- Berman reports that suicide rates in small, rural communities are more than twice as high as those among urban Native residents. Indeed, he writes, that the post-1980s decline in suicide rates may stem from more Alaska Natives moving to urban areas. (Today, about 10 percent of the state’s population lives in small, rural, predominantly Alaska Native communities.) In other words, Berman writes, the data suggests that ""opportunities in the modern economy (higher median incomes) and a strong traditional presence (linguistically isolated households) offer some protection against young male suicide."" ""Research suggests that it was local communities' loss of control over their communities and land that is more relevant to the rise in suicide, not welfare,"" Berman told PolitiFact. In other words, Alaska Native suicide is a much more complex subject than Young was letting on. Our ruling Young said that suicide comes from federal government largesse ""saying you are not worth anything but you are going to get something for nothing."" Data suggests high suicide rates among Alaska Natives stem more from cultural changes, including the transition from rural, traditional practices to urban life. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBCC7940>],/factchecks/2014/oct/27/don-young/alaskas-don-young-says-suicide-linked-federal-gove/
