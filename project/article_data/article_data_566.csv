A vote for any Democrat is not a vote for socialism, open borders and tax increases
","A new national ad sponsored by Future 45, a pro-President Donald Trump Super PAC, claims that voting for any Democrat will result in chaos. ""The screaming. The violence. The smears. And death threats. The far left moving to socialism. Undefended open borders. Immediate tax increases. 100 percent government-run health care. The booming economy, stopped. Nancy Pelosi, back in power. Gridlock. And then, impeachment. Is that really what you want? Voting for any Democrat gets you all of that."" The sweeping statements, paired with images of protests and a burning flag, are intended to frighten. But the ad distorts the platforms of most Democratic candidates running in the 2018 election. ""This is wild and over-the-top exaggeration and hyperbole,"" said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ""Outlandish is the nicest way of putting it."" Future 45 did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Republicans have used the socialist label to attack Democrats over policies for decades. It has become a common, but still false, motif during the 2018 midterms. Running for U.S. Senate, Florida Gov. Rick Scott called Democratic incumbent, Bill Nelson, a socialist: We rated that Pants on Fire. We rated as False a claim from Republican Ron DeSantis that Andrew Gillum has a ""far left socialist platform"" akin to Venezuela. The claim that U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio is fond of communism also rated False. The narrowest definition of socialism is where the state owns all the means of production, said Eduardo Gamarra, a political science professor at Florida International University. That’s not what any Democrat is running on. When Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez use the term, they are referring to expanding the social programs already available, along with potentially higher tax rates to pay for them. That resonates with the systems in place in Canada or Europe; not Venezuela or Cuba. Even the programs that may be labeled as socialist carry broad support, like Social Security, ""which has secured bipartisan support for over 70 years,"" Gamarra said. This attack is misleading because Medicare for All doesn’t call for a fully government-run health care system. It’s a gross exaggeration to claim all Democrats support the measure. Medicare for All is the most fundamental change to the health insurance system among the  proposals put forth by Democrats in Congress, according to Tricia Neuman, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. Sanders’ bill has 16 Democratic co-sponsors and similar legislation in the House has 123 co-sponsors. But Peter Dreier, a political theorist at Occidental College, said Medicare for All does not fit the bill of socialism. ""In Medicare for All, private providers, private doctors, nurses and hospitals will provide the health care,"" Dreier said. ""The government will provide the insurance, which is what Medicare is now."" Other senators have introduced similar, though less sweeping, bills to provide a Medicare buy-in  through the marketplace or for older individuals who have not yet hit 65. There are no ""immediate"" tax increases on the horizon. Most Democrats have called for changing or repealing parts of last year's tax cut. In March, Senate Democrats unveiled a plan to finance infrastructure projects by rolling back parts of the law. Senators Chuck Schumer of New York, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Maria Cantwell of Washington and Bill Nelson of Florida presented the blueprint. The plan calls for increased taxes for corporations and the rich as well as cutting the carried interest loophole that benefits some money managers, while repealing or reforming the cap on state and local tax deductions (which would be a cut). But the proposal is unlikely to go anywhere soon. ""Whoever wins control in November, there is still Republican President Trump in the White House,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""So even in the unlikely event that both chambers flip to Democrats, they won't be able to do anything ‘immediate’ regarding taxes."" Congressional Democratic leaders have called for a restructuring of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, but no one has called for immigrants to freely cross the border. A few Democrats seem to want the agency shuttered, but others talk of restructuring or a new focus. Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi have called for reforms to ICE. In July, we found six additional Democrats in the House and Senate who have said they want to ""abolish,"" ""dismantle"" or replace ICE. Rep. Mark Pocan, of Wisconsin, said he planned to introduce legislation to abolish ICE, because the Trump administration had ""so misused ICE that the agency can no longer accomplish its goals effectively."" But that’s hardly all Democrats, and it’s not a call for open borders. ""I don’t support open borders, I don’t know any Democrat who supports open borders,"" Pocan said in a June 30 Twitter video. ""In fact, ICE doesn’t operate at the borders. The Customs and Border Protection operates at the borders. So anyone who says that, is either ill-informed or outright lying."" Future 45 said voting for ""any Democrat"" gets you ""socialism ... undefended open borders ... immediate tax increases ... 100% government run health care ..."" The Democratic Party is a tent that houses a wide variety of views. Some candidates are self-proclaimed socialists, but even their platforms don’t fit the narrow definition of traditional socialism. Some, not all, support expansions of Medicare, but that would not qualify as 100 percent government-run health care. These and other policies may raise taxes, but immediate tax increases are unlikely under a Republican president. The tax increases on the table mostly target the rich and corporations. And finally, Congressional Democratic leaders have called for a restructuring of ICE, but no candidate has called for undefended open borders. The ad cherry-picks extreme positions and suggests all Democrats support them. That is false and ridiculous.

","A post on a Facebook group called ""Drain the Swamp"" uses old images to falsely claim that they show migrants currently traveling in a caravan toward the United States.

A photo slideshow — which includes an image being shared now — said migrants riding on top of trains became vulnerable targets for kidnapping gangs, cartel operatives and corrupt Mexican officials. The other image of people outside coach buses is credited to Jose Castanares and taken for AFP/Getty Images in April of this year, when another migrant caravan was enroute to the United States. A caption for that photo says the caravan of migrants was in Mexico and that it began breaking up ""after abandoning its plan to travel en masse to the United States.""

""While political pressure over the caravan mounted north of the border, in Mexico the migrants continued their journey. … Sometimes they stowed away aboard freight trains.

And then there’s the topic: Did Burger King really admit to using horse meat? In short, no. But the tale does have its roots in a real news story. In 2013, the fast-food chain announced it had stopped buying beef from Silvercrest Foods in 2013 after tests found horse DNA in some products, according to the Associated Press. At the time, Burger King announced that the decision was a ""voluntary and precautionary measure"" and ""not a food safety issue."" In its story, Everyday Useful Info names ""Silvercrest,"" as the firm that provided the horse meat. Burger King Worldwide on Jan. 31, 2013, issued a press release regarding the Silvercrest scandal. It stated that it had been notified that health officials were investigating Silvercrest’s products, which prompted the restaurant chain to conduct its own investigation. ""Our independent DNA tests results on product taken from BURGER KING® restaurants were negative for any equine DNA,"" the press release said. ""However, four samples recently taken from the Silvercrest plant have shown the presence of very small trace levels of equine DNA. This product was never sold to our restaurants."" Burger King said that its investigation established that Silvercrest used ""a small percentage of beef imported from a non-approved supplier in Poland.

These are the product being sold in our restaurants today."" Not once in its statement did Burger King say, as this article in Everyday Useful Info states, that it was using horse meat in its burgers and whoppers.

The DCCC ad ends his quote with Barr saying that he’s ""served in a position where ideas matter."" But, it isn’t the complete quote: ""We both served our country. I’ve served in a position where ideas matter. My opponent has served her country in the military, where execution matters."" The ad stops short of finishing Barr’s quote and makes it look like he said something more damning – that political office experience is more important than serving in the military.

""A member of Congress serves his / her constituents,"" spokeswoman Jodi Whitaker said. ""They get people their Social Security checks, Medicare payments, veteran benefits.""

The facts on Ohio steel mill reopenings under Donald Trump
","President Donald Trump said in his 2017 inaugural address that rusted-out factories were ""scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.""

Recently, the president claimed some of Ohio’s industrial jobs had since been resurrected. He said the United States was now ""taxing the hell out of the dumpers"" that were ""hurting your steel industry.""

""All across Ohio, steel mills are reopening, and we are putting our coal miners back to work. One of the things we’re most proud of. ... When I came into office, steel was dead. Steel was dead. Now they're opening up plants, U.S. Steel, Nucor, they're opening up plants all over the country. Big ones. New ones. We're taxing the hell out of the dumpers. You know, we had the dumpers who were hurting your steel industry."" Trump said at an Oct. 12 rally in Lebanon, Ohio. Trump was in town to support Ohio Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, who is challenging Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown. While Brown has been ahead in the polls, Ohio is considered a competitive state for Republicans following Trump’s strong win in the battleground state in 2016.

We looked at whether steel mills across Ohio had, in fact, reopened. We found evidence of one idling mill reopening and a handful of steel companies making additional investments in Ohio. Trump’s claim of mills across the state reopening is exaggerated, but steel companies are making new investments. Earlier this year, Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum, which he argued would protect American metals industries in competing with foreign imports.

The White House did not respond to our request for comment.

In Ohio, there are 7,700 iron, steel mill and ferroalloy manufacturing jobs as of Sept. 1, which is roughly the same amount as there were in January 2017. ""When you look at the employment numbers (in Ohio), you cannot find an increase in employment from the June imposition (of the steel tariffs) or from when the rumors started kicking around in January,"" said Ohio State University professor Ned Hill, an economist who studies American manufacturing. ""The notion that there are hundreds of mills reopening or ready to reopen, there’s not much behind that,"" Hill said.

We found several examples of steel mills reopening or expanding in the two years, both before and after Trump announced the steel tariffs earlier this year.

In June 2018, Republic Steel announced plans to restart its furnace in Lorain, Ohio, after it had idled since 2016. It partially reopened in September 2018, bringing 80 new jobs to the city. The company credited the steel tariff. Republic Steel is also adding a shift at its Canton location.

JSW Steel USA initially planned to restart the Mingo Junction electric-arc furnace in September 2018. On Oct. 11, the company said it would restart in a ""matter of weeks."" The furnace has been idle since 2009. Plans to reopen precede Trump’s tariffs.

In January 2017, before the tariff, Charter Steel announced plans to build a new $150 million mill in Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio. In April 2017, Nucor Corp. announced it would invest $85 million to upgrade the rolling mill at its steel bar mill in Marion, Ohio. Many additional mills in Ohio are actively hiring workers, according to Hill. The active hiring started about three years ago for the first time since 1997. Foreign imports do have a role in the decrease in steel industry jobs over the past 50 years, but experts told us bigger factors in the decline are technological improvements and productivity growth.

""The basic story is that one person can produce a lot more metal today than he or she could produce,"" a few decades ago, Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, told us in March.

We found data for employment in the primary metals-producing sector, which incorporates five subcategories: iron and steel mills, steel product manufacturing from purchased steel, aluminum production and processing, production and processing of metals other than iron and aluminum, and foundries.

Nationwide employment in primary metals manufacturing bottomed out from 451,600 in early 2008 to 347,300 in early 2010 after the recession and global economic crisis.

By the end of 2014, it had rebounded to 402,600 as a result of the Obama economic stimulus before falling again to 368,100 in January 2017 due to lower oil prices and a flood of imports, according to United Steelworkers spokesman Wayne Ranick.

Employment has since risen to a projected 382,300 for September 2018, largely the result of trade policies that have stabilized the domestic market, Ranick said. Paul Nathanson, a spokesman for the Coalition of American Metal Manufacturers and Users, said that the tariffs were hurting U.S. steel-using manufacturers and that the tariffs raise the prices of both domestic and imported steel. ""Manufacturers who use steel as a primary input to make parts for the automotive, aviation, energy, appliance, defense and other industries are losing business to overseas competitors who can make the same part for less because they pay global (lower) prices for steel and import that part into the U.S.,"" Nathanson said. Trump said that steel mills were reopening across Ohio. While experts have mixed impressions about the long-term job growth from Trump’s steel tariffs, we found evidence of a handful of steel companies investing in their Ohio plants and at least one example of an idling mill reopening.

Facebook isn’t the only place this idea has spread. Back in 2013, Virginia State Sen. Stephen Martin also claimed that the KKK was created by Democrats. The Republican lawmaker soon retracted the statement after after PolitiFact Virginia started to investigate the origins of the KKK. Reporter Sean Gorman discovered then that the group’s founding is murky but that ""historians generally agree it was founded by a handful of Confederate veterans in Pulaski, Tenn. as a social fraternity and it quickly changed into a violent group that terrorized newly empowered black and white Republicans in the South."" One historian confirmed there’s a historic link between the Democrats and the KKK: Many angry Southern whites during the 1860s and 1870s were Democrats, and some joined the KKK. But according to J. Michael Martinez, who wrote the 2007 book ""Carpetbaggers, Cavalry and the KKK,"" it’s misleading to say the Democratic Party founded the Klan. It was a more of a grassroots creation, Martinez said. Plus, the Democratic Party of the past is not the Democratic Party of today. From the 1930s onward, ""you think of the Democratic Party being considered the party of the disenfranchised,"" he said. Carole Emberton, an associated professor at the University of Buffalo, agreed. ""Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to the white ‘Dixiecrats’ flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,"" she said. Back in the mid-19th century, various Klans in the South acted as a ""strong arm"" for many local Democratic politicians, Emberton said. The Confederate general believed to be the KKK’s first Grand Dragon even spoke at the 1868 Democratic National Convention. By the time the Civil Rights Act became law, the Democratic Party supported so-called liberal causes that ""had been the banner of the Republican Party."" While some Democrats supported the KKK, there’s  no evidence the group was founded by their political party.

Maine Democratic Party overstates Poliquin's plans
","What’s the difference between a trim, a cut or a jagged, painful gutting? The Maine Democratic Party prompts such a question, thanks to a mailer it sent to homes in much of the state. It accuses Bruce Poliquin, the incumbent Republican in Maine’s expansive 2nd Congressional District, of ""voting to gut your retirement benefits."" The flyer then breaks this down, saying Poliquin has ""turned his back on us by: ""Voting to gut Social Security ""Supporting a raises in the retirement age and capping cost of living increases for Social Security. ""Voting to cut $500 billion from Medicare ""Voting for a tax plan that rewards his donors but adds nearly $2 trillion to the debt, and will force cuts to Social Security and Medicare."" That’s enough to make any retiree frugal, and by necessity, too. But it also appears to be overkill. Here’s why. Some of the ad’s claims are based on a series of votes by Poliquin to approve tax cuts and a federal budget blueprint. Poliquin supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reduced individual and corporate income tax rates. The Maine Democrats’ flyer provides footnotes to explain how this could affect Social Security and Medicare, and how the tax plan helped Poliquin’s donors. The $1.5 trillion tax package was promoted as a way to propel the economy, because companies would have more money to invest and hire, and families would have more disposable income. Poliquin’s donors presumably supported the cuts, but it is impossible to say whether his retiree-donors — who have given more than $368,468 for his re-election — like them more or less than people behind the business PACs that have given him $1.25 million, or any other donors who helped make up his $3.6 million campaign chest, as of Sept. 30. The only thing certain about that is, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, about 45 percent of the tax cut benefits go to the top 5 percent of earners in the first year, and by 2027, 83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent. The tax cuts were paid for through borrowing, and that borrowing will help push annual deficits to over $1 trillion by the year 2020, the Congressional Budget Office says. The CBO agrees that the tax cuts will ""increase the supply of labor and capital in the economy, thereby raising potential output."" But counting interest, the tax cuts will nevertheless add a cumulative $1.9 trillion to the federal debt over the course of 10 years, the CBO projects. Democrats said from the start that the loss of tax revenue was certain to bolster Republicans’ calls for cuts to Social Security and Medicare, which the GOP says are otherwise unsustainable. Together, they account for about 40 percent of all federal spending. In fact, in early December, 10 days before the House vote on tax cuts, U.S. News reported that House Speaker Paul Ryan said Congress would ""have to get back next year at entitlement reform"" in order to tackle the debt and the deficit. The Democrats’ worries over this were bolstered recently when on Oct. 16, less than two weeks after the Maine Democrats approved their mailer and prepared to send it to homes, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said spending on the retirement programs would need to be contained. McConnell blamed federal spending, not the tax cuts, for the problem. So how severe could this containment be, and would it amount to a gutting? McConnell and other Republicans have discussed for several years the possibility of shrinking the growth of Social Security and Medicare, not gutting it. Based on public discussions, this would involve delaying or trimming benefits for future retirees, not current ones. This leads to the second part of the Maine Democrats’ claim — that Poliquin ""has turned his back on us"" by ""supporting a raise in the retirement age and capping cost of living increases for Social Security."" The Democrats cited a YouTube video from a 2011 breakfast speech to the Portland, Maine, Community Chamber of Commerce in which Poliquin, then the state treasurer, discussed a $4.3 billion shortfall in the state’s pension fund for teachers and state workers. To deal with it, he supported a proposal to limit cost-of-living increases for current retirees, require higher payments into the fund by those still working, and delay retirement — until age 65 — by workers there less than five years. That was a state pension issue, not a Social Security one. In Maine, employees in the public pension system don’t pay into Social Security and generally don’t draw its benefits. But the next year, when Poliquin ran unsuccessfully in a primary for U.S. Senate, he was quoted in National Review as saying he had a plan for saving Social Security: ""The way to do it is raise the retirement age for new entrants and also slow down the rate of growth of benefits."" The other part of the Democrats’ claim is that Poliquin voted ""to cut $500 billion from Medicare."" This is based on his vote in 2017 for a nonbinding House budget blueprint that laid out Republican priorities, including cutting $487 million from the growth rate of Medicare over a decade. To make this cut, the House would gradually raise Medicare’s eligibility age, which is now 65, or lower than Social Security’s age for full benefits (which is now 66 and moving slowly to age 67). The Republican plan called for a ""premium support"" program, which means seniors would get a voucher so they could pick among private insurance plans or stick with traditional Medicare. PolitiFact in 2017 looked at a similar proposal from Senate Republicans — who called for a Medicare cut of $473 billion — and determined it would provide the program with 5.5 percent less than if Medicare continued at its current projected spending rate. The Maine Democratic Party said Poliquin ""voted to gut your retirement benefits."" Technically, Poliquin did not vote to do anything to Social Security, although a discussion about cuts is likely. As he said in 2012 of Social Security, ""The way to do it is raise the retirement age for new entrants and also slow down the rate of growth of benefits."" Similarly, he voted for a budget blueprint that, while not binding, called for getting more insurers involved in Medicare, offering a ""premium support"" for it and gradually raising the program’s eligibility age. PolitiFact is not pollyannaish. There easily could be slices and dices, which is partly why we have rated claims that referred to that possibility — claims based on the tax and budget bills — as Half True. But ""gut"" is a strong word and, based on what is known, goes too far. We rate claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/oct/24/maine-democratic-party/maine-democratic-party-overstates-poliquins-plans/

Donald Trump wrong that opioid bill didn't get much Democratic backing
","  Did Democrats try to shirk efforts to pass a bill on opioids that President Donald Trump recently signed? Trump said they did at a rally in Lebanon, Ohio, on Oct. 12. He said, ""I'll soon sign into the law the largest legislative effort in history to address the opioid crisis where just this year we got $6 billion from Congress — thanks to (Ohio Republican Sen.) Rob Portman and a lot of others — thank you, Rob — but Rob and so many others helped. Very little Democrat support."" Was this a mostly Republican-backed bill? Not at all. In fact, it garnered as close as you can come to universal support in this politically polarized era. The bill offered such provisions as barring fentanyl from being imported by mail, expanding the ability of nurses to prescribe medication to counter opioid addiction, and enhanced access to treatment for Medicaid recipients. It was originally introduced in June by several House Republicans and Democrats. The Democrats included Reps. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, Richard Neal of Massachusetts, Frank Pallone of New Jersey, and Tim Walz of Minnesota. The initial version passed the House by a 396-14 margin and the equivalent version passed the Senate by a 99-1 margin. After the chambers ironed out their differences, the final version passed the House 393-8 on Sept. 28 and the Senate 98-1 on Oct. 3. (The only vote against the bill in the Senate — on both versions — was by a Republican, Mike Lee of Utah.) The bill then went to the president, but he hasn’t officially signed it yet. The New York Times called it ""rare bipartisan accord."" The bill’s bipartisan nature was among the top themes in news coverage. We reached out to the White House but did not hear back. Trump said the recent opioid bill had ""very little Democrat support."" That couldn’t be further from the truth.

No, Hurricane Willa is not headed toward the migrant caravan

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim about people rioting over sanctuary cities
","Down the stretch in the midterm elections, President Donald Trump has escalated his rhetoric over immigration. For instance, during an Oct. 20 rally in Elko, Nev., he criticized ""sanctuary cities,"" a somewhat fuzzy term that refers to localities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement authorities. ""I don't think we like sanctuary cities up here,"" Trump told the crowd in Nevada. ""By the way, a lot of people in California don't want them, either. They're rioting now. They want to get out of their sanctuary cities."" Is it really the case that in California, ""they're rioting now"" over sanctuary cities? We found no evidence of it. The White House did not respond to a request for evidence for this article, and Trump himself sidestepped an opportunity to cite specific evidence during remarks to journalists boarding Marine One at the White House on Oct. 22: Reporter: ""Hey, Mr. President, you said Californians were rioting over the sanctuary cities.  Where?"" Trump: ""You shouldn’t have — take a look. They want to get out of sanctuary cities. Many places in California want to get out of sanctuary cities."" Reporter: ""But that's not rioting, sir, right?"" Trump: ""Yeah, it is rioting in some cases."" Reporter: ""Where are the riots, sir?"" At that point in the media availability, Trump turned to an unrelated question. It’s worth noting that there is no broad consensus on the question of whether sanctuary cities are good policy. A June 2018 Gallup poll found that 50 percent of those surveyed favored ""banning sanctuary cities,"" while 46 percent opposed a ban. And a March 2018 CBS News poll found that 48 percent favored leaving immigration enforcement policy up to the locality, compared to 47 percent who said localities should be forced to comply with federal authorities. (As we’ve written, the wording of poll questions can make a significant difference on how people answer these questions.) And the battle has moved to the courts. In addition to stepping up efforts to get cities to cooperate with federal officials, the Trump administration sued California over its sanctuary law. The populous and historically Republican Orange County in suburban Los Angeles moved to join the lawsuit against the state. However, the existence of discontent in some quarters doesn’t mean that riots are under way, or were recently. We found nothing of the sort in Google searches, and officials from California who would be in a position to know said there was nothing to Trump’s assertion. ""Short answer: no,"" said Evan Westrup, a spokesman for California’s Democratic governor, Jerry Brown. Jonathan Muñoz, a legislative assistant with the California Police Chiefs Association, agreed. ""The California Police Chiefs Association is unaware of any riots taking place as a result of the state’s sanctuary city policy,"" Muñoz said. ""What we do know is that some cities are challenging the policy in court, but that’s as far as anyone has gone to my knowledge."" Trump said that in California, ""they're rioting now"" over sanctuary cities. There is no evidence to support that assertion.

Donald Trump touts nonexistent $450 billion in Saudi orders and 1 million jobs
","The death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside Saudi Arabia’s embassy in Istanbul has drawn attention to America’s business interests in the Middle East kingdom. President Donald Trump brought money into the picture soon after Khashoggi disappeared, and has repeated the point several times since. In an Oct. 20 exchange with reporters, Trump called Saudi Arabia’s initial arrests and firings of top officials in the case a ""good first step."" As for how the United States should respond, Trump offered a dose of realpolitik. ""With all that being said though, we have $450 billion, $110 billion of which is a military order, but this is equipment and various things ordered from Saudi Arabia, $450 billion,"" Trump said. ""I think it's over a million jobs. That's not helpful for us to cancel an order like that. That hurts us far more than it hurts them."" The $110 billion in arms sales to the Saudis would be eye-popping enough, but this was the first time we heard the $450 billion total that included everything else. Nor has Trump said that 1 million jobs are on the line. We decided to check those points. Saudi Arabia has not ordered $110 billion worth of military goods and services. Saudi Arabia has not ordered $450 billion worth of goods and services across the board. Over one million jobs are not at stake. The $110 billion in military contracts emerged from Trump’s 2017 meeting with King Salman bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohamed bin Nayef of Saudi Arabia, and Deputy Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia. (Mohamed bin Salman is now crown prince and sits at the center of the speculation over the circumstances of Khashoggi’s death.) ""President Trump and King Salman participated in the signing ceremony for almost $110 billion worth of defense capabilities,"" the White House announced. The press release said the arms package expanded opportunities for American companies in the region, ""potentially supporting tens of thousands of new jobs in the United States."" Note: Tens of thousands is a far cry from hundreds of thousands of jobs, but we’ll get back to that in a moment. The $110 billion itself is in doubt. ""The $110 billion is not even remotely solid,"" said U.S. Naval War College professor Jonathan Caverley. ""The State Department only counts $14.5 billion in implemented’ sales from this deal."" And even that sum is suspect, Caverley added. The U.S. approved the sale of a $13.5 billion Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system. Former CIA officer Bruce Riedel at the Brookings Institution in Washington said that deal is on shaky ground. ""The Saudis let pass a September deadline for the deal with Lockheed Martin,"" Riedel recently wrote. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency oversees foreign military sales. Not counting the THAAD contract, its summary of sales to Saudi Arabia under Trump totals a little over $2 billion. Defense analyst Rachel Stohl at the Stimson Center, a private defense policy think tank, noted that the $110 billion rolled in some old offers. ""Many of those were deals negotiated under the Obama administration, and only a small fraction have been filled,"" Stohl said. That’s the typical pattern for these announcements: Fanfare comes first, followed by a more modest reality. ""President Obama offered Saudi Arabia something like $115 billion in arms while in office, and just about half of that resulted in sales,"" Jennifer Spindel, an international security professor at the University of Oklahoma, told us. And even sale agreements take a long time to play out. In the past 10 years, the United States and Saudi Arabia have had $85.5 billion in sales agreements, but only $24.5 billion in actual deliveries. That time lag has major implications for jobs. Before we get into the dicey link between contracts and jobs in America, it’s important to note that some of the deals involve building things in Saudi Arabia, not the United States. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Commerce and Development touted partnerships in 2016 to build Black Hawk helicopters and space video surveillance satellites in the kingdom. So sales contracts don’t necessarily lead to manufacturing jobs in America. With that caveat, let’s look at the one year where we have estimates that tie jobs at home to all exports to Saudi Arabia, whether that’s planes, corn or software consultants. In 2015, the U.S. Commerce Department said exports ""supported an estimated 165,000 jobs."" That included both direct jobs and the knock-on effect of the money from those sales working through the economy. The same year, exports totalled $29.7 billion. Divide the jobs by the dollars and you find that for every dollar in exports, the United States gets .0000056 of a job. Which might not like sound like much, but obviously it does when you start talking about billions in sales. Now, if the $110 billion in arms sales were locked down and came in one single year, the math says they would generate more than 600,000 jobs. Here’s why that isn’t in the cards. We know the $110 billion is at best aspirational, but the other big issue is that military contracts play out over many years. The arms experts we reached said smaller ones of about $200 to $300 million typically take three to four years for completion. The bigger systems take much longer. ""A decade is the ballpark in terms of minimum time between initial signing of a deal and the delivery of the capability, with money disbursed across the life of the contract,"" Caverley at the War College said. ""It will probably take even longer given the new Saudi requirements that 50 percent of the work needs to be performed in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia will have to develop a massive amount of defense industrial capability that currently does not exist in order to handle this work."" Even if Saudi Arabia bought everything it said it wanted, the yearly jobs impact would be more in the range of 60,000 to 120,000. That’s not close to the hundreds of thousands Trump has talked about. Trump said that all told, Saudi Arabia has $450 billion in orders from the United States. We asked the White House and the U.S. - Saudi Arabian Business Council for any data on this. We did not hear back. Total exports of goods and services in 2017 were $25.4 billion. Hossein Askari, a business professor at George Washington University, analyzes international trade in the Middle East. He knows of no tally of contracts to back up Trump’s assertion. ""There is absolutely no such number that could support the $450 billion,"" Askari said. Trump said that Saudi Arabia has ordered $450 billion from U.S. companies, including $110 billion in military contracts, representing over a million jobs. Orders on that scale don’t exist. There is no data behind the $450 billion, and the $110 billion is a blend of smaller deals in progress, old offers that have not come through, and speculative discussions that have yet to move forward. Trump’s claims about jobs ignores the long runway between signed agreements and actual delivery and payment. He treats spending that could play out over a decade as if it were spent in one year. More importantly, if the $450 billion in orders is a mirage, the 1 million jobs is equally without substance.

More than 90% of women change their minds about having an abortion after seeing an ultrasound, Rachel Campos-Duffy says
","
The same day the state Senate approved a bill requiring women to get an ultrasound before getting an abortion, Rachel Campos-Duffy appeared at a Wisconsin Right to Life gathering in Appleton. 
The controversial bill drew striking comments from some senators. One Republican said abortions ""became the thing to do"" in the 1960s and a Democrat said the bill was government trying to ""find its way into a woman’s vagina."" 
Meanwhile, Campos-Duffy -- a conservative pundit, occasional host of ""The View"" TV show and wife of U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Hayward -- made her own eye-catching statement about ultrasounds and abortion. 
In connection with the June 12, 2013, Right to Life event, she did a video interview with the Appleton Post-Crescent newspaper, saying: 
""So, it really doesn’t make sense to me when people who purport to be advocates for women suddenly say, ‘Oh, we don’t need those pesky ultrasounds, you don’t need all of that information,’"" Campos-Duffy said. ""It seems very dubious, their motivation, because we always want the patient to have as much information as possible. 
""Now, it's true that once a father or a mother who are seeking an abortion see an ultrasound, it's true that upwards of 90 percent of them decide not to have an abortion. Our opposition may not like those results, but those are what people decide after they have all the facts in front of them."" 
Do more than 90 percent of women seeking an abortion decide not to get one after seeing their ultrasound? 
The law 
Gov. Scott Walker signed the bill July 5, 2013. Besides ultrasounds, the law requires doctors who perform abortions to have hospital admitting privileges. A judge has temporarily blocked the requirement on doctors, but the ultrasound provision remains in effect. 
Before a woman can get an abortion, an ultrasound must be performed. There are exceptions for a medical emergency or in cases in which the pregnancy is the result of incest or sexual assault, if those crimes have been reported to police. 
The person performing the ultrasound must describe what is being shown and provide the woman an opportunity to see the ultrasound images. But the woman can't be required to view the images. 
Eleven other, mostly southern states have adopted laws that require an ultrasound before abortion although the laws are in effect in only nine of the states, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group focusing on reproductive health issues. 
The states are Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia. However, North Carolina’s law is temporarily unenforceable pending a court decision and Oklahoma is permanently blocked by court order. 
Campos-Duffy’s evidence 
As for Campos-Duffy’s claim that ""upwards of 90 percent"" of women seeking an abortion decide not to have one after seeing an ultrasound, she told us her source was the Knights of Columbus. She cited a page on the Catholic group's website that describes how the group helps bring ultrasound machines to ""pro-life pregnancy help centers."" 
""Reports indicate that up to 90 percent of women considering an abortion choose to have their baby after seeing an ultrasound image,"" the website said. ""They hear their baby’s heartbeat, they see their baby’s head and fingers. They know it is a child, not a ‘choice.'"" 
But that's merely a statement similar to Campos-Duffy's, not evidence that her statement is correct. 
Joe Cullen, of the Knights of Columbus’ national office in New Haven, Conn., told us his group based its 90 percent statement on statements by two other organizations -- Focus on the Family and ICU Mobile. Like the Knights of Columbus, both groups help supply ultrasound machines for anti-abortion pregnancy centers. 
Interestingly, the Knights removed the 90 percent statement from its website after we heard from Cullen. 
Let’s see what the other two organizations have to say. 
Focus on the Family 
Focus on the Family is a multi-faceted organization in Colorado Springs, Colo., founded by evangelical Christian Dr. James Dobson. It provides grants to pregnancy centers for ultrasound machines. 
Focus on the Family claims that since its ultrasound program began in 2004, ""the estimated number of babies saved"" is more than 201,000. 
But the group told us it doesn’t claim that any particular percentage of women seeking an abortion change their minds after seeing their ultrasound. 
ICU Mobile 
ICU Mobile, based in Akron, Ohio, makes a claim similar to Campos-Duffy’s, saying on its website that ""86.9 percent of women considering an abortion who see their baby aboard an ICU Mobile choose life."" 
The website says the statistic is for 2010 and breaks down this way: The mobile units provided ultrasound images to 1,389 women; 613 were ""abortion minded or abortion vulnerable""; and 533 of them, or 86.9 percent, ""made a decision for life."" 
That statistic, though unverified, helps Campos-Duffy’s claim a little, but it applies to a relatively small number of women and there are some other caveats. The women are categorized by ICU Mobile as being undecided but leaning toward having an abortion. And the group does not indicate how it determines whether a woman, after receiving an ultrasound, ultimately gave birth or had an abortion. 
Indeed, ICU Mobile’s claim is much lower for women who had decided to have an abortion before they saw an ultrasound. Just over half of those women change their mind after the ultrasound, the group claims. 
Other sources 
Other sources do not support Campos-Duffy’s contention -- at least not for the 90 percent claim she made. 
University of California, San Francisco: Researchers interviewed 20 women who received an ultrasound ""as part of their abortion care"" and published a study in November 2012. The women’s responses ""offer support for anti-abortion claims that ultrasound viewing can dissuade women from abortion, as well as support for abortion rights claims that viewing an ultrasound can cause emotional difficulty for a woman planning to abort."" 
But in a separate article, one of the researchers, Tracy Weitz, director of the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the university, said ""no peer-reviewed empirical data has supported this proposition that viewing an ultrasound image discourages women from abortion."" 
University of British Columbia: In a study published in 2009, researchers gave questionnaires to 350 women who came to two abortion clinics, asking if they wanted to view an ultrasound. Nearly 73 percent got the ultrasound and 86 percent of them described it as a positive experience. But none changed their minds about having an abortion. 
University of Texas at Austin: Researchers there and from the University of Alabama at Birmingham gave surveys to 318 women who sought abortions at clinics in six Texas cities in 2012; 72 percent looked at their ultrasound. Before their consultation and ultrasound, 92 percent of those women said they were sure of their decision, or that abortion was a better choice for them. Afterward, the percentage was unchanged. 
We’ll also note that the conservative Family Research Council in Washington, D.C. cites on its website various statements indicating that women are more likely to opt not to have an abortion after seeing an ultrasound; one pregnancy center director in Baton Rouge, La., is quoted as saying that ""98 percent of women who have ultrasounds choose to carry to term."" 
But the council makes no claim and provides no evidence indicating that on a national level upwards of 90 percent of women seeking an abortion change their minds after seeing an ultrasound. 
Our rating 
Campos-Duffy said ""upwards of 90 percent"" of women seeking an abortion decide not to have an abortion after seeing an ultrasound. 
Research indicates that some women seeking an abortion change their mind after having an ultrasound. But, while one anti-abortion organization claims a figure of nearly 90 percent for its ultrasound program among a certain group of women, there is no solid evidence to back Campos-Duffy’s sweeping claim.

Miami-Dade has ""nation's highest-rated tap water""
","
Miami-Dade has plenty to brag about: stellar beaches, celebrities who live in multimillion dollar mansions, four-star restaurants, the world famous tennis tournament on Key Biscayne and the national basketball champions the Miami Heat. 
But a county document boasted about something far more ordinary when Mayor Carlos Gimenez released his budget proposal July 9. A budget-in-brief document written by the county’s Office of Management and Budget stated that the county has ""the nation’s highest-rated tap water."" 
Do we have some sort of liquid gold pouring out of our faucets that is the envy of other counties nationwide? We went in search of answers to quench our curiosity. 
Miami-Dade has long promoted tap water 
First, let’s wade into the surprisingly controversial history of Miami-Dade county government talking up tap water. 
In 2008, the county landed in hot water after it aired radio ads that boasted its tap water was better than bottled water. 
Nestle Waters North America, which makes nearly $4 billion a year selling Zephyrhills and other brands, threatened to sue, the Miami Herald wrote. (It never did sue, a county spokeswoman told PolitiFact.) 
The county continued to promote tap water, including a mock boxing match video between tap water and bottled water, a love song jingle ""Miami-Dade tap water your No. 1!"" and a video of a young cowboy asking Mom, ""Howdy M'am? What do you have on tap?"" She replied, ""For you partner, I’ve got the original tap."" 
Miami-Dade’s explanation 
We asked a Miami-Dade county spokeswoman to explain the source of the claim that the county has the ""nation’s highest-rated tap water."" 
We sensed some research percolating at Miami-Dade County Hall as spokespersons sent us emails saying we’d get an answer soon. 
A few hours later, we had a reply: ""It’s a scrivener’s error,"" said Jennifer L. Messemer, a spokeswoman in Miami-Dade’s water and sewer department. 
Budget director Jennifer Moon told us in an email that ""we compile input from the various departments to put in the budget-in-brief. We realized yesterday that we inadvertently left out 'one of' in the statement regarding the highest rated water. We will correct this online and in future prints."" 
(At PolitiFact we give props when someone fesses up to an error, but we continue our fact-check anyway.) 
The error was in a document written by the budget department, according to Messemer. We did not find the same claim in other water-related documents. The full chapter on the water and sewer department’s budget proposal merely refers to the water as ""high-quality drinking water."" (It also mentions an upcoming $1.6 billion projected to fix environmental violations from failing wastewater infrastructure.) 
The annual water quality report states that the water ""is delicious and meets and exceeds all local, state and federal guidelines. So drink up with confidence!"" 
The county has received some kudos for water quality. 
Messemer pointed to a 2008 Forbes.com’s Top 10 list of ""Best Cities for Clean Drinking Water."" The article, which ranked the Miami/Fort Lauderdale area fourth, was based on a 2007 water quality study compiled by University of Cincinnati researchers. (The report was sponsored by Proctor & Gamble.) 
We found the most comprehensive water quality comparison in an analysis by the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization that says the federal government’s standards for water quality fall short. 
The group spent three years analyzing water contaminant data nationwide and found 316 contaminants. The EPA has enforceable standards for less than half of them. 
Released in 2009, the database evaluated water utilities based on the total number of chemicals detected, the percentage of chemicals found of those tested; and the highest average level for a pollutant relative to legal limits or national averages. The analysis included the most common pollutants such as disinfection byproducts, nitrate and arsenic. 
The group published a ranking of large cities, and Miami came in 46th place out of 100. (Several other large Florida cities or counties were listed, including Odessa, which is served by the St. Petersburg Water Resources Department, 20th; Pinellas County, 57th; Hillsborough County, 65th and Tampa, 68th.) You can read about government officials pushing back against the report in the Miami Herald. 
Our ruling 
A Miami-Dade County budget document claimed that the county has ""the nation’s highest-rated tap water."" 
A county spokeswoman said that statement was an error. The water department more typically talks about the ""high quality"" of the water without making a national comparison. 
An article in Forbes concluded the Miami/Fort Lauderdale area was fourth in water quality based on a 2007 University of Cincinnati study of 12 contaminants. A more thorough national analysis by the Environmental Working Group ranked Miami-Dade County at 46th in 2009. 
The claim is wrong, but it isn’t so ridiculous to earn our lowest Pants on Fire rating. We’re still going to end with one more joke and pour a cold bucket of tap water to douse this claim.

The Ohio Democratic Party says an Ohio House bill would require women seeking abortions to undergo transvaginal ultrasounds
","
The anti-abortion provisions slipped into Ohio’s budget have been ratified, but the Republican-controlled legislature is still considering other efforts to restrict abortions. 
House Bill 200, introduced by Rep. Ron Hood and supported by 34 of his Republican colleagues, would double the state’s 24-hour waiting period for abortions, compel doctors to tell patients that having an abortion will increase risk of breast cancer and require women seeking abortions to undergo what some doctors say are medically unnecessary ultrasounds. 
Democrats and abortion-rights advocates have publicly denounced the measure. 
The Ohio Democratic Party sent out a statement blasting Hood’s bill, saying House Republicans are ""legislating shame on Ohio’s women."" 
""They introduced a bill that would force women facing the most personal of health decisions to endure a transvaginal ultrasound,"" said a statement by Liz Brown, deputy executive director of the Ohio Democratic Party. 
PolitiFact Ohio determined that Hood set his pants on fire when he used the bill to link an increased risk of breast cancer to abortions, but we wanted to find out if the Ohio Democratic Party is also guilty of propagating medical misinformation.    
Hood’s bill would require doctors to perform ultrasounds on women who request an abortion and to give patients a verbal description of the ultrasound, including an audible heartbeat, if available. The legislation does not specify what type of ultrasound must be performed beyond saying an ""obstetric"" ultrasound. 
The legislation says a doctor must perform an ultrasound that ""portrays the entire body of the embryo or fetus"" under threat of a first-degree felony charge and a fine of up to $1 million. 
Hood calls the measure the ""Ultrasound Access Act."" The legislation aims to ""give every Ohio mother the opportunity to see an ultrasound photo of her baby before making an abortion decision,"" Hood said. 
So, would this ""opportunity"" force women to undergo a transvaginal, or internal, ultrasound? That depends, experts say. 
The Ohio Democratic Party told PolitiFact that the group got its information on transvaginal ultrasounds from a handful of sources, including ""Prenatal Tests and Ultrasounds: The Facts"" written by two ultrasound experts from a New Jersey-based OB/GYN medical practice. It also provided a study published in the journal ""Seminars in Reproductive Medicine."" 
The sources say that transvaginal ultrasounds are more accurate and are often used over external transabdominal ultrasounds during early pregnancy.   
""Not surprisingly, transvaginal ultrasound has been shown to be better at visualizing early pregnancy than is transabdominal ultrasound,"" according to the study. 
Some doctors say a transvaginal procedure, under certain circumstances, may be the only method that would provide the necessary image. 
Dr. Anita Somani, a physician at Comprehensive Women's Care in Columbus, said earlier this month during a press conference held by Democrats to decry HB 200 that in some cases an external transabdominal ultrasound could reveal an embryo or fetus in its entirety. But, depending on the age of the embryo or fetus and the patient’s body type, a transvaginal ultrasound may be needed to comply with the legislation, Somani said.    
""You may not see anything on a transabdominal ultrasound until a woman is further along in her pregnancy,"" Somani said, adding that a transabdominal ultrasound is not likely to produce an accurate image of a fetus or embryo during the first trimester. 
Like a judicious patient, PolitiFact wanted a second opinion. 
Dr. Daniel Grossman, a San Francisco-area physician and vice president of research for the sexual and reproductive rights group Ibis Reproductive Health, concurred with Somani’s assessment. 
In most cases, the only way to get a clear and detailed image of the embryo or fetus during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy is to perform an ""invasive, uncomfortable"" transvaginal ultrasound, Grossman said. 
""It’s a medical procedure that is not always required to perform an abortion,"" Grossman said. ""Like any medical test or procedure, it should be performed at the physician’s discretion."" 
And why not seek a third opinion, just for good measure? 
Dr. Donna Harrison, executive director of the American Association of Pro-life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said a transvaginal ultrasound gives a very close-up picture of the ovaries and inside the uterus, whereas a transabdominal ultrasound gives a wider view. 
""If it is very early in the pregnancy, to see if there is a living embryo, you would need a transvaginal ultrasound,"" Harrison said, adding that the internal procedure would be needed to accurately date a pregnancy in the first nine weeks. 
The statement by the Ohio Democratic Party implies that all women seeking abortions would be forced to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound. 
Women seeking abortions would have to undergo some form of ultrasound, and many women seeking early-term abortions could face the internal procedure. 
But the Ohio Democratic Party did not clarify the circumstances. We rate its claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/jul/12/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-says-ohio-house-bill-would-r/

Rand Paul says Gallup poll found 70 percent of Egyptians opposed to U.S. aid
","
The Egyptian military’s ouster of President Mohammed Morsi amid major anti-government protests has prompted some American politicians to urge the U.S. to hold back some or all of the roughly $1.5 billion in aid it gives annually to Egypt. Those who support an aid cutoff argue that despite the popular uprising, the military’s removal of a democratically elected leader undermines democracy, requiring a negative response from the U.S. 
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., went a step further, arguing that Egyptians don’t even want the aid we give their country in the first place. (Paul is a longtime critic of foreign aid in general.) 
In a Fox News interview on July 8, 2013, host Eric Bolling asked Paul why President Barack Obama hadn’t called the ouster a ""coup."" 
Paul responded, ""You know, I think they are confused on this. They, like so many supporters of foreign aid, think that that's how we buy friendship around the world, that's how we influence people. But the interesting thing is, there was a Gallup poll in Egypt last year, and 70 percent of Egyptians don't want our money. So, they burn our flag, they don't want our money and we say, ‘Oh, here, you must take it, or we want you to behave and act like Americans.’ But there isn't a whole lot of real democracy going on over there."" 
We wondered whether Paul was right about the high level of public opposition to U.S. assistance in Egypt. 
The answer is that Paul is right. In fact, the opposition to aid is even more widespread among Egyptians than he had indicated. 
In a February 2012 poll, Gallup asked Egyptians, ""Do you favor or oppose the U.S. sending economic aid to Egypt?"" Gallup pollsters found that 82 percent opposed such aid. 
That was the highest level of opposition recorded in six Gallup polls between April 2011 and February 2012. Even the lowest level of opposition found in these polls -- 52 percent in April 2011 -- meant that a majority opposed U.S. aid. So it’s a stance that seems pretty widespread in Egypt in recent years. 
In a September 2012 analysis of its survey results, Gallup wrote that ""Egyptians may resent U.S. aid for the same reason some members of Congress are calling it into question -- it is seen as a tool of U.S. influence with Egypt's government."" 
The attitudes Gallup found are mirrored in Pew poll data from spring 2013. 
Pew asked Egyptians, ""Overall, would you say U.S. economic aid to Egypt is having a mostly positive impact, a mostly negative impact, or no impact on the way things are going in Egypt?"" 
Overall, 24 percent of respondents said ""mostly positive,"" 55 percent said ""mostly negative"" and 18 percent said ""no impact."" When the wording of the question was varied to say ""military"" aid rather than ""economic"" aid, attitudes turned even more negative. Ten percent of respondents said ""mostly positive,"" 58 percent said ""mostly negative"" and 28 percent said ""no impact."" 
These findings rang true with experts we contacted. 
""There is no doubt that there are large numbers of Egyptians who don’t want our aid,"" said Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. 
While Paul’s claim is accurate, there’s one thing worth noting. 
The polls Gallup (and Pew) conducted did not use the familiar telephone-based random sampling technique most commonly seen in the United States. The Gallup poll used face-to-face interviews conducted in Arabic with 1,000 adults age 15 and older. Gallup has explained that face-to-face surveys are ""normally conducted … by dividing a given population into blocks of roughly equal population density. Each block is further divided into blocks until a single household is chosen at random, and then a single respondent is randomly chosen from the household."" 
The use of this methodology doesn’t mean such polls aren’t trustworthy -- if U.S.-style telephone methods had been workable in Egypt, Gallup could have used them -- but the approach is so different that we think it’s a point worth noting. 
According to Gallup, the margin of sampling error for the April 2012 survey was 3 percentage points, though the company also acknowledges that ""question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls."" Pew, for its part, makes clear that security concerns for pollsters made it impossible to include about 2 percent of the population that lives in ""frontier"" regions. 
Our ruling 
Paul said, ""There was a Gallup poll in Egypt last year, and 70 percent of Egyptians don't want our money."" That actually understates what Gallup found. One of the firm’s polls from April 2012 found that 82 percent of Egyptians opposed such aid. Other polls and regional experts confirm the existence of such levels of opposition.

"['Abortion', 'Children', 'Women', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says more and more extremely premature babies grow into healthy childhoods
","
Gov. Rick Perry spoke up for restricting abortions earlier in pregnancy by saying that extremely premature births increasingly result in healthy children.

To Democratic opposition and a sustained uproar in the Texas Senate gallery, a proposal intended to tighten the regulation of abortion in Texas perished at the end of the session that ran through June 25.

Perry reacted by calling a fresh special session before telling the National Right to Life Convention in a June 27, 2013, speech: ""We will ban abortion after 20 weeks"" of pregnancy.

""And you think about it,"" Perry said, ""it makes sense considering the growing number of healthy, happy children who are born prematurely at the same early gestation that our laws allow abortion.""

Current law 
Texas currently restricts abortions in the third trimester of pregnancies, which starts 26 weeks after a woman’s last menstrual period, as defined in state rules. This yardstick--time since the last period--is also about two weeks longer than the length of a pregnancy, meaning the time after the egg has been fertilized.

This distinction bears on the Texas debate because the proposal backed by Republicans including Perry would shorten the period during which most abortions would be permitted by four weeks. So, we took Perry’s speech statement as referring to infants born in those same four weeks, the 20th through 23rd week of pregnancy, though Perry spokesman Rich Parsons said by telephone that this was an injection of context on our part that didn’t accurately reflect the governor’s remark. ""That’s a lie,"" he said.

Nationally, very few babies are born in the weeks targeted by the legislation. In 2010, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, less than 1 percent of the nearly 4 million U.S. births occurred before even 28 weeks of gestation.

Still, do more and more of such extremely premature infants survive to healthy childhoods, as Perry said?

By email, Perry spokesman Josh Havens offered studies as backup for the claim, but also said, ""The point the governor is making is that babies born prior to the third trimester can survive outside the womb.""

That’s so, we learned from research and interviews with experts, though survival rates are low for such babies and whether more survivors reach healthy childhoods is murky.

We hunted for relevant research. 
Governor's backup

Havens pointed out an article in the April 2012 issue issue of Obstetrics and Gynecology, titled ""Improving Survival of Extremely Preterm Infants Born Between 22 and 25 Weeks of Gestation."" 
The article, based on research led by a University of Iowa physician, reviewed the births of 237 babies born without major congenital anomalies after 22 to 25 weeks of gestation from 2000 through 2009 and concluded that more survived than would have been expected based on predicted survival rates based on outcomes of a national study from 1998 to 2003. The Iowa study said: ""These findings reflect improvement in survival"" of such babies ""whose parents elected aggressive treatment."" The study did not look into how the babies fared into childhood.

Havens also noted a study described in the May 1, 2013, Journal of the American Medical Association. According to an online summary, researchers in Sweden assessed 456 children born before 27 weeks of gestation from 2004 through 2007 and concluded, after check-ups at about 30 months of life, that about three in four of the survivors had mild or no disabilities, 16 percent had moderate disabilities and 11 percent had severe disabilities. 
Babies born the earliest were worst off, the summary says. More than half the children born at 23 weeks of gestation or earlier had moderate or severe overall disabilities at 30 months as did 60 percent of those children born at 22 weeks of gestation or earlier. The summary does not say whether the prevalence of disabilities at 30 months was an improvement compared to extremely premature babies born in earlier years.

Other analyses 
At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, spokeswoman Karen Hunter suggested we seek research insights from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which opposes the Texas measure.

By email, a college spokesman, Gregory Phillips, pointed out its physician guidelines, issued in September 2002 and reaffirmed in 2012. The guidelines state that survival rates for newborns born at the ""threshold of viability,"" defined as 25 or fewer weeks of gestation, improved in the early 1990s largely thanks to medical steps taken after those births, though extreme preemies still faced long odds. A chart in the guidelines, based on a study of more than 4,600 such babies born in centers around the country in 1995 and 1996, indicates no survivors among a dozen babies born after 21 weeks of gestation; a 21 percent survival rate among babies born after 22 weeks; and a 30 percent survival rate among babies born after 23 weeks.

Phillips also suggested we contact the American Academy of Pediatrics, which put us in touch with Kristi Watterberg, a University of New Mexico professor and pediatrician who chairs the academy’s Committee on Fetus and Newborn.

By email and telephone, Watterberg agreed that survival rates of extremely premature babies have improved, thanks in large part to post-birth medical interventions and pre-birth steroid treatments, which especially help tiny lungs mature, she said..

However, Watterberg said, it remains questionable whether more extremely premature babies grow into healthy children. ""Survival has increased for those  babies on the cusp of viability,"" Watterberg said. ""Whether their short- or long-term outcomes have improved is much less clear. We need studies of babies at school age, as adolescents and as adults.""

Watterberg said the Iowa study offered by Perry’s office included too few babies — only 16 infants were born before 24 weeks of pregnancy — to reach broad conclusions. A study would need to consider a couple hundred like-timed births to begin to support reasonable comparisons and conclusions, she said. ""You cannot make any pronouncements based on that,"" she said.

Watterberg said by email: ""It's very difficult to get a good handle on long-term outcomes for large populations of extremely preterm infants - there aren't that many at 22 - 23 weeks, they have a high mortality rate, and follow-up studies are limited.  There is a wide variability in reported outcomes"" as well, she said.

Watterberg singled out several other studies and our review of them led us to mention of another:

—A study published by BMJ in December 2012 compared short-term survival rates of extremely premature babies born in 2006 to similar babies born in 1995. In 2006, more than 1,100 of about 3,100 such babies survived to leave the hospital, the authors wrote. Still, less than half of the babies born in 2006 before 25 weeks of gestation survived, according to the study, compared to 66 percent or more of babies born at 25 weeks or later.

Also, the authors wrote, ""the pattern of major neonatal morbidity,"" meaning major conditions, remained unchanged from 1995. Serious conditions included lung disease, brain injury and retinopathy (a disease that can lead to loss of vision). ""These observations reflect an important increase in the number of preterm survivors at risk of later health problems,"" the authors wrote.

A Dec. 3, 2012, press release issued with the BMJ-published study said: ""These results suggest that the total number of children in the community with lifelong health problems as a result of extremely preterm birth will rise, and represents an important increase in workload for health, educational, and social services, they conclude.""

—The same release said another study published by BMJ compared neurological and developmental outcomes at age 3 in babies born before 27 weeks of gestation in 2006 with babies born between 22 and 25 weeks in 1995. For such babies born in 2006, severe disability at age 3 years increased as gestation shortened, from 20 percent of survivors at 26 weeks’ gestation to 45 percent at 23 weeks, according to the release, with the  most common impairment being developmental or cognitive function.

Between 1995 and 2006, the ""proportion of survivors with severe disability at 3 years was unchanged,"" the press release said. ""However, an estimated 11% more babies born between 22 and 25 weeks survived without disability."" Fewer of the extremely premature babies had disabilities, but the same proportion had severe impairments in 2006 as in 1995, the release said. The authors also stressed that these findings be interpreted with caution, with additional research about the children as they age being critical before deciding there have been big changes in the frequency of disabilities.

—A study posted online in August 2010 in Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, reviewed outcomes for more than 9,500 very small infants born from 22 weeks through 28 weeks of gestation from 2003 through 2007. Upshot: More than half of infants born at 24 weeks of gestation or later survived, the study said, though many infants had major conditions as well.

""During the 5-year study period,"" the authors wrote, ""there was no substantial improvement in rates of survival to discharge for extremely low gestation infants.... However, each additional week of"" gestation age (GA) ""at birth had substantial survival advantage; the most marked changes were between GAs of 22 and 25 weeks, with survival rates increasing from 6% to 72%. Furthermore, rates of survival to discharge without major"" diseases ""increased dramatically between 22 and 25 weeks, with continued steady improvement for each additional week of gestation.""

— A study published in April 2008 in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at outcome at 18 to 22 months for nearly 4,200 infants born at 22 to 25 weeks’ gestation, with a focus on whether intensive care made a difference. At 18 months, 61 percent had died or had severe impairments, the authors wrote, counting 98 percent of infants born at 22 weeks, 84 percent of infants born at 23 weeks; 57 percent at 24 weeks; and 38 percent at 25 weeks.

Federal institute 
Separately, we reached out to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which has a website enabling anyone to calculate survival rates of very young babies by inputting the length of pregnancy and other factors. Robert Bock, an institute spokesman, said by email its neonatal researchers consider a study steered by a Brown University pediatrician, Bonnie E. Stephens, to be the best reference on longer-term outcomes for babies born extremely early.

The study, published in June 2009 in the journal Pediatric Clinics of North America, states that survival rates of infants born ""at the limits of viability,"" 22 to 25 weeks of gestation, ""continued to improve"" through the 1990s. However, the study says, such improvements over the previous 20 years ""have not been accompanied by proportional reductions"" in disabilities among such babies. The study says, in fact, that there is ""increasing evidence of adverse outcomes into school age and adolescence,"" a conclusion the authors trace to about 25 other studies.

Our ruling

Perry said more and more extremely premature babies grow into healthy childhoods.

We found research indicating that more extreme preemies -- some born during the period when abortion is permitted -- make it home from the hospital and live into early childhood. But evidence is lacking to prove the children's long-term health; in fact, we found that many of these children face major health challenges.

Jonathan Stickland says Texas has more than 80,000 abortions each year
","
CLARIFICATION, 11 a.m., July 11, 2013: We amended this story to clarify that the law requiring a sonogram and a 24-hour wait before an abortion was phased in starting Sept. 1, 2011, an indication that it would not have deterred abortions the whole year. 
  
As the Texas House renewed debate on proposed changes in abortion law July 9, 2013, state Rep. Jonathan Stickland said on Twitter, ""Today is about the 80,000+ children"" whose ""life is stolen"" per year in Texas. 
That’s a widely used number -- one we even reaffirmed as recently as a June 2013 tweet. But it’s also out of date and too high, according to the latest count finalized by a Texas state agency. 
The same 80,000 count was cited during the July 8, 2013, anti-abortion rally at the Texas Capitol, both by state Sen. Donna Campbell, R-New Braunfels, and in a written statement from U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that was read aloud. A July 1, 2013, Associated Press guide to the abortion-law fight used the figure as well. 
In February 2011, when state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, aired the 80,000 figure, we rated his statement as True based on information from Texas’ Department of State Health Services and the New York-based Guttmacher Institute. 
The number of Texas abortions reported in 2008 -- the year with the most recent data available at that time -- was 81,591, according to the state agency. The 2008 Texas tally was 84,610, according to Guttmacher, a research group focusing on reproductive health issues. 
Luke Macias, a Stickland consultant, told us by email that the Bedford Republican made his claim based on our 2011 article. Macias said, too, that Stickland depended on Guttmacher’s figure for Texas abortions in 2008 when he and fellow Tarrant County lawmakers sent 84,610 pieces of blue and pink paper to state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, on June 25, 2013, the day she famously filibustered to stall abortion legislation. 
The proposed restrictions were reintroduced in a second special session of 2013, which began the first week of July. The legislation would prohibit most abortions after 20 weeks of gestation, require any doctor performing abortions to have admission privileges at a nearby hospital and mandate that abortion clinics be certified as ambulatory surgical centers. 
But the number of abortions has decreased since Patrick’s statement, as we wrote in a Feb. 12, 2013, fact-check that drew on newer state information. Austin Democratic state Rep. Donna Howard claimed generally that abortions were decreasing, which was True, we found, on both the state and federal levels. 
The Texas tally had dropped for several consecutive years, while nationally the total hovered around 1.2 million from 2005 through 2008, by one analysis, and the number and rate decreased in 2009, according to information analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Our story included a chart, emailed to us by agency spokeswoman Carrie Williams, showing reported abortions in Texas rose from 76,121 in 2000 to a peak of 82,056 in 2006, then declined again to a preliminary 2011 total of 72,470. 
The Texas total was greater than 80,000 in 2006, ‘07 and ‘08, but below 80,000 in the other nine years on the chart. The average from 2007 through 2011 was 78,116. 
On July 9, 2013, State Health Services spokeswoman Christine Mann told us by phone and email that the chart’s figures were still correct, and that the 2011 figure of 72,470 released in August 2012 had been finalized Feb. 26, 2013. She said a 2012 count was not yet compiled. 
Guttmacher spokeswoman Rebecca Wind told us by phone July 9, 2013, that their count of 84,610 Texas abortions in 2008, drawn from survey research, was still the most recent available from the institute. 
Mann told us the state figures came from mandatory reports that providers file each year with her agency; Wind told us Guttmacher sends a survey every four years or so to ""all known abortion providers.""

So, Texas had about 72,500 abortions in 2011 -- down from about 82,000 in 2006, according to the state, whose figures also indicate there have not been more than 80,000 abortions since 2008. 
Neither the Texas agency or Guttmacher had guidance for us on why the number of Texas abortions has declined. 
A July 10, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story cited Theodore Joyce, a professor at Baruch College in New York, as saying that after a 2003 change in Texas law, abortions at or beyond 16 weeks of pregnancy dropped by 88 percent. 
Joyce studied effects of the law, which required that such abortions be performed at ambulatory surgical centers rather than abortion clinics. In 2004, no abortion clinics in Texas qualified as ambulatory surgical centers, Joyce said, but by 2006 Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio had such centers. 
Changes made in 2011 to Texas law could also have decreased the number of abortions, according to a study from the University of Texas, the University of Alabama and Ibis Reproductive Health (a nonprofit group that advocates for access to abortions). The researchers concluded that new mandates for a sonogram followed by a 24-hour wait before abortions, requiring two clinic visits, caused fewer Texas women to seek abortions. That law was phased in starting Sept. 1, 2011. 
Regarding the latest state figures indicating about 72,000 abortions in the state in 2011, Macias said that with abortion totals ranging between ""72,000-84,000 over the last decade,"" Stickland believes ""both of those numbers and anywhere in between are too high."" 
Our ruling 
Stickland said there are ""80,000+"" abortions each year in Texas. 
That was last true in 2006, 2007 and 2008, according to the state, but the number has declined since, with 72,470 Texas abortions reported in 2011. Still, Guttmacher, a respected source, hasn’t updated its data since its survey reporting 84,610 Texas abortions in 2008, arguably giving Stickland’s claim an element of truth.

Allen West says more Americans receive food aid than work in the private sector
","Former U.S. Rep. Allen West, a staunchly conservative Republican who represented a Florida district for one term, recently sent a tweet that resurrected one of the themes used by Mitt Romney and others during the 2012 presidential campaign -- the idea that there are makers and takers in America. Here’s what West tweeted: ""More Americans receive food aid than work in private sector. ‘Fundamental transformation?’ Nope, nation destruction."" The tweet linked to an article in the conservative website CNSNews that provided data to support his claim. The CNSNews article cited a report by the inspector general of the Agriculture Department, which operates most federal food-assistance programs, as well as employment data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The inspector general’s report said that ""FNS estimates that a total of 101 million people currently participate in at least one of its programs."" The CNSNews article compared this figure to BLS data showing that there were ""97,180,000 full-time private-sector workers in 2012."" However, we see a number of problems with this comparison, and how West framed it. The employment figure is likely higher than 97 million We looked at the BLS figures for April 2013 so we could match them to the most recently available figures for participation in food-assistance programs, which are from that month. According to BLS, 113.6 million Americans had a private-sector job during April 2013. That’s more than the 101 million figure for food assistance. The CNSNews number -- 97 million -- was smaller because it subtracted part-time workers and used 2012 data, neither of which were qualifications made by West. The food-assistance number is likely lower than 101 million For means-tested benefits such as these, it seems plausible that an individual who qualifies for one program may also qualify for another. It would be odd if at least some fraction of children qualifying for a free or reduced-price school breakfast wouldn’t also qualify for a free or reduced-price school lunch, and if some of the these same children didn’t also qualify for food stamps at home. In fact, studying overlap was actually the whole purpose of the inspector general’s report. It concluded that ""the potential for overlap and duplication exists"" among the department’s nutrition programs. But participation in all of these categories is counted separately. No steps were taken to avoid double- or triple-counting people who receive more than one type of food assistance when the 101 million figure was calculated, an approach confirmed to PolitiFact by Agriculture Department spokeswoman Jessica Milteer. ""Many participants in our programs are eligible to take advantage of more than one nutrition assistance program,"" she said. Here's the breakdown of participation in the food-assistance programs listed on the Agriculture Department’s website:   Program Participants Period Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) 47,548,694 April 2013 National School Lunch Program 30,839,021 April 2013 School Breakfast Program 13,481,128 April 2013 Food aid for adult and child care 3,535,000 Highest month, fiscal 2012 Summer Food Service 2,347,000 Highest month, fiscal 2012 Women-Infants-Children 2,032,248 April 2013 Indian Reservation Food Program   76,500 All year, fiscal 2012 Commodity Supplemental Food Programs (non-elderly) 17,600 All year, fiscal 2012 Commodity Supplemental Food Programs (elderly) 576,600 All year, fiscal 2012 Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program 863,097 All year, fiscal 2011 WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition 1,900,000 All year fiscal 2011 TOTAL 103,216,888   This is quite close to the 101 million cited in the inspector general’s report. If efforts had been taken to weed out overlap between the programs, the figure would be much lower. (Unfortunately, the inspector general’s report didn’t provide an estimate of how much overlap exists.) The comparison isn’t especially enlightening The universe of people who could potentially receive food aid is the entire U.S. population. But the universe of people who could potentially hold a private-sector job consists only of those 16 years old and over. And one could easily make that universe smaller by excluding those who are 16 or 17 (and who are supposed to be in school) or those older than 65 (who have reached retirement age). If you adjust for the differences in the size of these universes, one could easily come to the opposite conclusion than the one West offered. Using the 101 million figure for food aid, which as we noted is likely overstated, means that about 33 percent of the U.S. population receives food assistance. By contrast, about 47 percent of people age 16 and up work in the private sector. If you restrict it to people age 18 to 64, the percentage working in the private sector rises to 59 percent. So, the percentage of working-age people with private-sector jobs is at least twice as high as the percentage of Americans who receive food assistance -- the opposite conclusion to the one West drew. And a final note: The categories of ""employed in the private sector"" and ""receiving food aid"" are not mutually exclusive. According to the department, ""over 30 percent of (food stamp) households had earnings in 2011, and 41 percent of all (food stamp) participants lived in a household with earnings."" Our ruling West tweeted that ""more Americans receive food aid than work in (the) private sector."" However, the data West used appears to have undercounted the number of people with a private-sector job and overcounted the number of people receiving food aid.

Jeb Bush says Canada issues more than 150,000 high-skilled visas, compared to 65,000 by the U.S.
","Republican enthusiasm for comprehensive immigration reform is in short supply on Capitol Hill, despite the arguments from many GOP strategists hoping to win more of the Hispanic vote. There’s no lack of enthusiasm from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, however. A few weeks ago he told conservative Christians that immigrants would rescue Social Security, and in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, he wrote about the vigor they would inject into the American economy. With his co-author, Clint Bolick from the Goldwater Institute, Bush made what they called the Republican case for immigration reform, based on a pro-growth policy. To bolster his point, Bush and Bolick compared America’s approach to immigrants with that of Canada’s. ""Canada has one-tenth of our population—yet it issues far more high-skilled visas (more than 150,000) yearly than we do (65,000),"" they wrote. Might our northern neighbor be doing something that would appeal to the GOP rank and file? We thought it would interesting to see if the data supported the numbers Bush and Bolick brought to bear. We contacted Bush’s office, and staff told us that the statement compared the 65,000 visas allowed under the H-1B program and the total number of what Canada calls economic immigrants -- people allowed into the country solely for reasons related to work. The central point was that much more than the U.S., Canada targets the kind of talent it needs to grow. The U.S. H-1B visa The U.S. program allows businesses to hire foreign workers who have theoretical or technical expertise in specialty fields. They might be scientists, engineers, computer programmers, or similar highly skilled professions. The minimum requirement is a bachelor’s degree, or its foreign equivalent. (In keeping with the idea that technical expertise is in the eye of the beholder, there’s a special provision for fashion models.) The employer applies, not the individual. Congress placed a cap of 65,000 H-1B visas per year, although another 20,000 are granted to foreign workers who have earned a master’s degree or higher at an American university. So, all told, at least 85,000 new people per year arrive in America with an H-1B visa. The actual number of these visas issued can be much higher, 135,530 in 2012, due to renewals and applications rolled over from previous years. Also, colleges, universities, and nonprofit or government research groups are exempt from the annual caps altogether. This visa provides temporary work status. It is good for three years, and while it can be extended, it generally does not allow a person to work more than six years. Canada’s skilled worker programs Canada has two separate pathways for foreigners to work in the country. One is for temporary workers; the other is for those who move to Canada permanently. The gateway for non-Canadians that most closely resembles the American H-1B visa is the Temporary Foreign Worker program. It allows eligible foreigners to work in Canada for up to four years if employers show that they are unable to find Canadians or permanent residents to fill the jobs and that the entry of these workers will not hurt the Canadian labor market. This program covers all jobs, from the unskilled to the most demanding. Within the temporary program, there is a special category for higher-skilled occupations. These are defined as managerial or based on a skill that at the very least requires several years as an apprentice, if not a bachelor’s degree or higher. According to government statistics, about 70,000 of these more highly skilled temporary workers came in 2008 and about 66,000 in 2011. The other program, the one that accepts foreigners directly into the country as permanent residents, attracted about 257,000 people in 2012. Of those, Canada classified about 160,000 as economic immigrants. Important details lie beneath these overall statistics, and we turn to those next. Comparing the U.S. and Canada Staff in Bush’s office told us that Canada’s 160,000 overall economic immigrants is the bottom line number that supports the figure used in the op-ed in comparison with the 65,000 in the American H-1B visa program. But we found several problems with matching apples to apples. For starters, H-1B is a temporary worker program; the Canadians are counting people admitted with permanent resident status. To stay for no more than six years compared to possibly the rest of your life is no small shakes. But there’s an even bigger issue with the figure of ""more than 150,000"" that Bush puts on the table. It greatly exaggerates the actual Canadian situation. H-1B is open only to highly-skilled workers -- that is just the workers and not their families. If we apply the same standard to Canada, then we must break down the various types of people they put under the economic immigrant umbrella. The Canadian government’s list includes caregivers, investors, entrepreneurs, and the largest one, skilled workers. Each type is listed twice; first for the principal applicant and then for that person’s spouse and dependents. Because the H-1B program only counts the worker and not his or her family, we decided to look at the Canadian figures and count only the principal applicant. When we do that, we see that the number of skilled workers last year was 38,577. The highest it reached was 48,820 in 2010. Adding in the other categories that might be considered high-skilled, such as entrepreneurs or investors, only adds a few thousand. The total remains quite a distance from 150,000. As a percentage of the nation’s population, it is much greater than the United States, but while Bush alluded to population, he did not present the figures that way. There is one type of economic immigrant that could change the total appreciably, although still leave it far short of 150,000. Canadian law allows provinces and territories to nominate their own economic immigrants. In 2012, this brought 17,177 new permanent residents to the country. We asked Michelle Parkouda to explain this part of the program. Parkouda is a senior research associate with the Conference Board of Canada, an independent group that does economic and policy analysis for businesses and the government. ""Provincial nominees do vary by the needs of the province,"" Parkouda said. ""For example, Saskatchewan is specifically targeting health professionals, farm operators, and long haul truck drivers, among others."" Parkouda explained that Canada defines skilled work broadly to include the trades. For the truly higher end, there is the category of Federal Skilled Worker. These are occupations that the federal government says the country most needs and the list includes geological engineers, physical therapists, land surveyors, medical laboratory technologists and more. The provinces she said, have emphasized the skilled trades. We found no analysis of the number of provincial nominees that would qualify as highly-skilled. In short, while the grand total of economic immigrants listed in the Canadian data support the figure in the Wall Street Journal piece, that total includes many people who are family members or less skilled workers. Lastly, Canada’s population is about 34.5 million. America’s is about 314 million. To say Canada has one-tenth the population of the U.S. comes pretty close. Our ruling Bush and Bolick said that Canada issues more than 150,000 high-skilled visa a year compared to 65,000 by the U.S. That 150,000 refers not to people with visas but those granted permanent resident status, and it includes family members of skilled workers, as well as workers who are not high-skilled. The only figures we can know for sure show a level of high-skilled workers closer to 50,000, or about one-third as large as Bush and Bolick claimed. If they had meant to speak of Canada’s temporary foreign workers, a reasonable fit with the H-1B program, the high water mark for such workers in Canada was about 70,000 in 2008.  That’s still about half of the number they put on the table. Combining both permanent and temporary workers would yield about 120,000 people, but they did not base their claim on that. On a relative basis, Canada does target high-skilled workers much more than the U.S., but the absolute numbers Bush and Bolick used fell wide of the mark. We rule the statement Half True. Editor's note: This report has been updated to include more details about exemptions and renewals of H-1B visas.",/factchecks/2013/jul/10/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-canada-issues-more-150000-high-skill/
"['Elections', 'Virginia', 'Ken Cuccinelli']","
Cuccinelli says McAuliffe has rolled out no policies
","
Republican gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli says Terry McAuliffe, his Democratic opponent, has introduced zero policies. 
""I’m the only candidate for governor who’s rolled out any policies so far,"" Cuccinelli said on June 11 as he announced his workforce development plan. 
Cuccinelli made a similar claim during a June 7 radio interview on WMAL in Washington. McAuliffe’s campaign is ""being very negative and they haven’t rolled out any policies,"" he said. 
No policies? Nada? Nary a one? 
To check Cuccinelli’s claim, we turned to Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary, which defines policy as ""a high-level overall plan embracing the general goals and acceptable procedures especially of a governmental body."" 
So there are two components to policy: a goal and a process to get there. And we’ll add one more ground rule: the proposals should be in writing.    
Scouring McAuliffe’s website, we came across several proposals that clearly met all of these tests and were released prior to Cucinelli’s June attacks. They are: 
*An executive order banning gifts over $100 to the governor’s family and barring all gifts to the governor’s household from lobbyists and others who do business with the state. McAuliffe said he would also ask the General Assembly pass the same rules for itself, the lieutenant governor and attorney general, in addition to requiring that gifts of more than $500 to dependent family members be publicly reported. 
*Creating a bipartisan commission to investigate ethics complaints against state politicians or discrepancies in their disclosure reports and refer violations to the proper disciplinary body. McAuliffe says the panel would have a ""small professional staff"" and would be funded through lobbyist registration fees. 
*Giving localities the option of reducing or eliminating the business and professional licensing tax, the machinery and tool tax and the merchants capital tax. McAuliffe would appoint a commission to help localities come up with revenue-neutral ways to end or cut the levies. Cuccinelli, we should note, also has proposed abolishing each of the three taxes. 
*Appointing a commission to recommend reforms to Standards of Learning tests given to public school students. McAuliffe says the multiple-choice tests are a flawed measure of teaching and learning and the state should also use essay and short-answer questions. 
So how does Cuccinelli come up with zero? 
Richard Cullen, communications director for the campaign, sent us an email saying Cuccinelli’s comments do not suggest that McAuliffe has put no proposals on the table. 
""Ken uses qualifiers that I think are important: ‘substantive,’ ‘nothing in detail,’ zero policy rollouts,’"" he wrote. 
It’s true that when Cuccinelli criticized McAuliffe in late May, he did use the words  ""zero policy rollouts,"" and added the caveat that his opponent had offered ""nothing in detail"" or ""substantive."" 
But those last two qualifiers disappeared as Cuccinelli amped up his attack in June, so they are not a  factor in this Truth-O-Meter. 
The term ""rollout"" remained in Cuccinelli’s comments and deserves consideration. ""Ken has outlined comprehensive policy proposals in front of reporters across the Commonwealth and allowed the public to digest and scrutinize his ideas,"" Cullen said. ""At no point has Terry McAuliffe done that."" 
Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary defines rollout as ""the widespread public introduction of a new product."" 
McAuliffe has not introduced policy with the verve of Cuccinelli, who called a news conference with the capitol press corps in May to announce his tax cutting plan and answer questions about it. But McAuliffe has publicized his major initiatives in press releases, interviews and speeches around the state.  
Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for McAuliffe, said the Democrat has put out ""lots of policies"" and referred us to a 13-page document on the campaign’s website entitled ""Putting Jobs First.""  In general, we found the document to be more of a platform laying out McAuliffe’s broad goals than a policy paper detailing how he would accomplish them. For example, McAuliffe repeatedly calls for greater investment in mass transit and public and higher education, but does not put price tags on his proposals or say how the state would pay for them. 
Cuccinelli, in contrast, has not issued a platform as broad as McAuliffe’s, but has unveiled some of his policies in greater depth that his opponent. Even so, Cuccinelli has left many major questions unanswered. 
For example, Cuccinelli has called for cutting the 6 percent corporate income tax rate to 4 percent over four years and reducing the 5.75 individual income tax rate to 5 percent over the same span. The cost of the cuts would be $1.4 billion a year, which Cuccinelli says he would pay for by eliminating tax exemptions and loopholes -- but he won’t say which ones. That work would be assigned to a commission after he was elected. 
Our ruling 
At least twice, Cuccinelli has said McAuliffe hasn’t ""rolled out any policies."" 
McAuliffe has rolled out a number of detailed steps for ethics reforms in state government. His proposals to improve standardized testing in public schools and give localities options to end some taxes, while relying on commissions to make the hard decisions, both set goals and a route for achieving them. 
We’re not conferring wonk status on McAuliffe or anything close to it. But Cuccinelli’s statement is an obvious stretch and we rate it False.",/factchecks/2013/jul/10/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-mcauliffe-has-rolled-out-no-polici/
"['Ohio', 'Families', 'LGBTQ', 'Bill Johnson']","
Rep. Bill Johnson says most Americans want “traditional marriage”
","Public reaction was fairly predictable when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, as unconstitutional. Many Republicans said marriage should between one man and one woman, and they supported the federal government’s refusal to recognize gay marriage or grant federal benefits to same-sex spouses. Most Democrats said the opposite, and they hailed the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision striking down DOMA as a gay-rights breakthrough. And then there was Bill Johnson, a congressman from Ohio, who sent an email statement that made us snap to attention. ""Americans of faith are under attack,"" Johnson, a Republican from Marietta, said in his June 27 statement.  ""First, the President refused to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, despite his legal, constitutional responsibility to do so.  Then, liberals on the Supreme Court refused to defend traditional marriage itself, even though that's what most Americans want. I will defend traditional marriage, because it's not a government's job to define it -- it was already defined by God."" PolitiFact Ohio has no desire to debate theology and no need to address whether Obama had an obligation to defend DOMA in court. The point is widely debated, but many of his predecessors from both parties also refused to defend laws they thought were unconstitutional. But another part of Johnson’s claim caught our interest -- that the traditional definition of marriage is ""what most Americans want."" We asked Johnson’s communications director, Mollie Riester, how Johnson knows that. She pointed to two things: A recent poll commissioned by the Huffington Post, and the fact that ""in most cases, when Americans are given a direct choice, they have chosen to defend traditional marriage. The basis for that is the total number of times a proposition has been on a ballot."" Let’s examine those in reverse order. It is accurate that voters in a majority of states have acted to prohibit same-sex couples from marrying. Even counting a handful whose legislatures have carved out exceptions for domestic partnerships or civil unions, 30 states including Ohio have passed constitutional bans on gay marriage, and five more have done so through statutory laws, according to a review by the Washington Post. But the other part of Riester’s answer -- current public opinion -- makes it problematic to use voter-passed bans as a measure to gauge gay-marriage opposition. That is, we looked at the date each state passed its ban, using a state-by-state search tool maintained by Freedom to Marry, a group favoring gay-marriage rights, and found that the majority passed their bans between 2004 and 2006, with a few earlier and a few later. A CNN timeline confirms this as well. In fact, when Texas became the 19th state to adopt a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, the year was 2005. Ohio voters passed their ban in 2004, as did voters in 10 other states, That doesn’t seem very long ago. But a wide array of public opinion polls show that views have shifted dramatically since then. Support for gay marriage has climbed steadily. A Washington Post-ABC News poll in March found that 58 percent of Americans believe it should be legal for gay couples to marry, and only 36 percent believe it should be illegal. More recently, a Pew Research Center poll after the Supreme Court ruling on DOMA -- and a related one that allowed California to overturn its gay-marriage ban -- found that 45 percent of people said they approved of the decisions, while 40 percent disapproved. On the related question of whether gays and lesbians should be allowed to wed legally, Pew said in May that 52 percent said yes and 42 percent said no. That would suggest exactly the opposite of what Johnson claimed when he said the ""Supreme Court refused to defend traditional marriage itself, even though that's what most Americans want."" But Riester, Johnson’s spokeswoman, cited a Huffington Post poll, so we took a look. That poll said that 43 percent of Americans said the government should recognize same-sex marriage and 45 percent said the government should not. The ""should not"" had the lead, in other words. But rather than indicating a majority opinion, this actually was a statistical toss-up, because the poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. What about all those states -- a majority of the nation -- that supported gay-marriage bans? Consider how much has changed since then. There is consistency in the polling, but we’ll give you two specific examples. From Pew, tracking  the issue since 1996: In 2004, the year Ohio voters decided that gay marriage should not be legally recognized, 64 percent of Americans agreed with that sentiment. By February 2012, the figure had dropped to 43 percent, and a larger share -- 48 percent -- favored same-sex marriage rights. Or to quote a USA Today story from July 1: ""By an unprecedented 55 percent - 40 percent, Americans say marriages between same-sex couples should be recognized by law as valid, with the same rights of traditional marriage. That's the highest level of support since Gallup began asking the question in 1996. Then, fewer than half that number, 27%, backed the idea."" Whether state voters will change their constitutions to support this shift is to be seen. Still, attitudes are a-changin’, to borrow a Bob Dylan line from another era of social shifts. Johnson would have been correct in 2004 and 2006, when voters throughout the country passed state constitutional bans on gay marriage. But in 2013, his statement has only an element of truth. It is dated. His claim rates Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/jul/10/bill-johnson/rep-bill-johnson-says-most-americans-want-traditio/

Rhode Island Rep. Charlene Lima said Economic Development Commission head promised in writing that taxpayers would never have to pay for the bonds sold to 38 Studios
","
One of the hot-button issues of the 2013 General Assembly session was whether the state should repay the bonds sold to help finance 38 Studios, the now-bankrupt video-game company founded by former Boston Red Sox player Curt Schilling. 
One state representative who has argued against repayment is Charlene Lima, a Democrat from Cranston. She told the House on June 26 that, before the bonds were sold in November 2010, she had been promised by the executive director of the Rhode Island Economic Development Commission (RIEDC) that taxpayers would not have to foot the bill if the deal with 38 Studios didn't live up to its promise. 
""When I was complaining to the former director, Keith Stokes, he sent me a letter and he said the taxpayers will never be on the hook for these bonds, for this money,"" Lima said. ""How was this properly vetted by these people if they were saying the taxpayers wouldn't be on the hook? And guess what. Today they ARE on the hook."" 
We're not going to get into the merits of the state’s controversial decision to start paying the cost of the ""moral obligation"" bonds, but we wondered whether Stokes, who resigned after 38 Studios collapsed, really had made a specific pledge in writing. 
We called Lima and she quickly forwarded a copy of an Oct. 4, 2010 letter from Stokes in which he complained that Lima had offered an ""inaccurate characterization of this investment and the RIEDC's degree of concern for Rhode Island taxpayers"" in a news release she had authored. 
At the time, the bond sale had been approved and the bonds themselves were about to be sold. 
Stokes wrote, ""In the unlikely event that the company is not able to meet its debt obligations,"" the state would have first crack at 38 Studio's assets. ""These collateral assets, in addition to the debt repayment reserves, would be used to pay back the loan before the application of any public funds would be considered. 
""This ensures that under no circumstances would taxpayers be asked to repay $75 million."" 
As Lima now notes, taxpayers are being asked to pay the money. (The $8.2-billion state budget, which the General Assembly passed and Governor Chafee signed, included $2.5 million for the first required taxpayer payment on the bonds. The total owed, with interest, is about $112.6 million.) 
To sum up, Lima said she received a letter in 2010 from then-RIEDC official Keith Stokes in which he insisted that Rhode Islanders would not be on the hook for the 38 Studios bonds. 
Lima earned a Pants on Fire last month for a comment she made about Rhode Island's failure to pass the Constitutional amendment authorizing the federal income tax. 
""If my pants were on fire,"" she said, ""what is he? A towering inferno?"" 
We don't have varying levels of conflagration. And in this case, we're simply judging the claim Lima made on the House floor. She has the evidence and we rate her statement True.

Group wants Georgia to block solar requirement
","
A recent email blast has sparked one of the hottest political debates in Georgia this summer. 
Americans for Prosperity’s Georgia chapter contacted its 50,000 members on July 1, warning them that the state’s Public Service Commission was preparing this month to make some major changes that would force Georgians to reach deeper into their wallets. 
""What if I told you something you're not even hearing about in the news is about to raise your electricity bill by more than 40 percent and reduce the reliability of every appliance and electronics gadget in your home?"" the organization’s state director, Virginia Galloway, wrote in the beginning of her email. 
How could this happen? The PSC is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to require that Georgia Power increase the use of solar energy in its long-term plan. States with such a mandate have electricity bills that are 40 percent more than those that do not, the group says. 
Not true, others say. 
Gwinnett County resident Debbie Dooley, a proponent of the plan who is the national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots, was quoted as saying Galloway was using outdated information to base her claim about the potential 40 percent increase. A PSC member made a similar argument. 
So who’s right here? PolitiFact Georgia sought to find out. 
Solar energy has generated a battle among many conservatives. Some say the use of renewable energy such as solar power has created more jobs. They also don’t want states to be dependent on one or two energy sources. Others object to the idea of forcing the marketplace to use renewable energy. They also contend some energy resources are too expensive. 
Galloway’s email, which she shared with us, contained a state-by-state chart of electricity rates put together by the Institute for Energy Research, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that evaluates public policy initiatives on oil, coal, wind and solar energy. Many members of its staff have worked for Republicans on Capitol Hill. A blog on its website criticized President Barack Obama’s recent speech on climate control. 
In early 2010, the institute published a 191-page report on energy regulation. The report examined ""renewable portfolio standards,"" a term used to describe how states require or encourage electricity producers to supply some of their electricity from designated renewable resources such as wind or solar energy. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia had some form of RPS guidelines, according to industry accounts. Georgia, like most Southern states, does not have an RPS policy. 
The report found ""mandating the use of wind and solar through renewable portfolio standards increases electricity costs for consumers."" Its chart shows the average price for electricity in states with a binding RPS policy is 39.4 percent higher in all sectors. The prices were based on kilowatt hours in 2009. 
Galloway also sent us a December report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration showing the average price for operating solar plants that will be active by 2018 will be higher than the costs for coal, natural gas and wind. 
PSC member Doug Everett told Americans for Prosperity that solar prices have fallen significantly since the institute’s report in 2010. 
""Some other states have seen dramatic price increases when implementing solar power because they went ahead with projects three or five years ago when solar prices were 70 percent higher than they are today,"" he said. 
Solar prices have fallen sharply in the past five years due in large part to global oversupply, according to news reports, industry websites and government reports. The federal government has also invested more money in solar research and development to lower prices. The accounts include: 
-- a  Reuters news service report that solar panel prices fell by 50 percent in 2011. 
-- a Reuters report that last year, the average price for silicon-based solar panels by top manufacturers fell to $0.7-$0.8 per watt, from around $3.5-$4.5 per watt in 2008. 
-- a U.S. Department of Energy report that solar energy installation prices dropped by 30 percent between 2008 and 2012. 
Daniel Simmons, an official with the institute, said via email that rates are driven by policy choices such as renewable mandates. 
""This is why California's electricity rates are much higher than surrounding states for example,"" said Simmons, the institute’s director of regulatory and state affairs. ""The overall point of our paper was pointing out these policy choices. Renewables mandates are one example of the type of policy choices that drive up electricity rates."" 
An Associated Press report also noted that there may be other factors that contribute to higher rates in states with binding renewable portfolio standards, such as the demand for energy and weather. 
Again, Americans for Prosperity’s Georgia chapter claimed in an email that electricity rates are 40 percent higher in states that have required utility companies to use a certain amount of renewable energy such as solar power. The chapter does not want Georgia to enact the same guidelines here. The claim is based on a study that appears accurate. But there is widespread news coverage that solar prices have fallen significantly in the past five years. It may be premature to make a correlation between the solar market and electricity prices. 
The chapter’s claim is based on accurate data, but it’s missing some important details. We rate it Half True.

Rachel Maddow says that Ohio budget includes requirement for transvaginal ultrasound
","Ohio’s new operating budget calls for $62 billion in spending over two years and several abortion restrictions, including one that requires patients seeking one to first undergo an ultrasound.   And while Democrats are plenty upset about the economics of the plan that Republican Gov. John Kasich ratified on June 30, they sense a political opening on the women’s issues.     Viewers of MSNBC’s ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" recently got a preview of the heated rhetoric that will typify this debate over the next 16 months as Kasich seeks a second term. Maddow, the cable news program’s liberal host, noted on her June 28 broadcast the anti-abortion measures the GOP-controlled General Assembly had added to the budget, which Kasich had yet to sign.     In interpreting some of the budget’s more-ambiguous abortion language, Maddow contended that the new regulations included a ""mandatory vaginal probe at the insistence of the state.""     Maddow was referring to a new requirement that women seeking abortions first receive ultrasounds to determine whether a fetal heartbeat is present. Her provocative words quickly went viral and sent PolitiFact Ohio in search of a full copy of the massive state budget.     Did it go as far as she claimed? Did it mandate a transvaginal ultrasound, as Maddow claimed, or did it allow for an external transabdominal procedure? We found our answer in the new Section 2919.191 that with the budget’s approval is now part of Ohio Revised Code.     Division A of that section says that before performing an abortion, a provider must ""determine whether there is a detectable fetal heartbeat of the unborn human individual the pregnant woman is carrying."" The method for detecting a heartbeat is then spelled out in Division C, which says:     The director of health may promulgate rules pursuant to section 111.15 of the Revised Code specifying the appropriate methods of performing an examination for the presence of a fetal heartbeat of an unborn individual based on standard medical practice. The rules shall require only that an examination shall be performed externally.     In other words, not only are external methods such as transabdominal ultrasounds allowed under the new law; they are required. That sinks Maddow’s claim of a ""mandatory vaginal probe.""     We reached out to MSNBC and asked representatives if Maddow had anything more to say, but we did not hear back from them.     Because Maddow is an opinion leader on the left, others ran with her claim. The Raw Story, which describes itself as a progressive news website, called attention to the Maddow segment in a June 29 post. And on Twitter, several users seemed to parrot Maddow in tweets at Kasich.     ""Nothing says Small Government like a mandated trans vaginal ultra sound,"" read one tweet.     ""Ohio Gov @JohnKasich just ended his re-election chance, by signing into law mandatory big-government-forced object-rape of pregnant women,"" tweeted another critic.     Abortion is a hot-button issue in politics. And with Kasich up for re-election next year, it’s no surprise that Democrats are eager for a debate that draws contrasts with the governor.     But there should be no debate about what types of ultrasounds these new regulations require. Had Maddow read the language closely, she would have seen a mandate -- for external detection methods. That puts Maddow’s ""vaginal probe"" claim about as far as can be from the truth, into the realm of the ridiculous.

Illegal immigrants are covered under the health care law, chain email says
","
There are no graveyards for ridiculous, oft-debunked chain emails. 
A lengthy, widespread email keeps resurfacing with dire warnings about Obamacare as determined by Judge David Kithil of Marble Falls, Texas. 
""Please for the sake of many good people, please... pass this on,"" the email begs. ""We all need to be informed."" 
Unfortunately, the email is riddled with errors, starting with the fact that is referring to an initial 2009 health care proposal that never became law. Still, because it has the subject line ""Obama Care Outrage,"" we thought people might confuse it with the health care law on the books. 
In that context, and given all the talk about potential immigration reform, one line jumped out: 
""The bill will provide insurance to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally,"" the email states. 
Make no mistake, this line is wrong in the context of the 2009 law (Pants on Fire! wrong, in fact), and wrong in the context of the health care bill President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. 
Let us explain. 
The Affordable Care Act contains an individual mandate that requires individuals to purchase health insurance. It allows U.S. citizens and legal residents to purchase insurance on health insurance exchanges, often receiving tax credits. 
But none of it applies to people who are here illegally. They don’t have to follow the mandate because they shouldn’t be here. They remain ineligible for regular Medicaid coverage, just as they are ineligible for food stamps. They cannot obtain coverage through state-based health insurance exchanges (thus, they are also ineligible for tax credits to offset the cost of getting that coverage). 
Now, certain low-income illegal immigrants are eligible for emergency Medicaid coverage, including childbirth and surgery. And federal law requires hospitals not to turn away individuals for emergency treatment, even if they are uninsured (or undocumented), according to the National Immigration Law Center. 
But those policies predate the Affordable Care Act. 
""They don’t get health insurance, which is coverage, which is different than a hospital getting reimbursed for Medicaid,"" said Laura Goodhue, executive director of Florida Chain, a consumer health advocacy group. 
The Affordable Care Act does provide some benefits for certain legal non-U.S. citizens. We repeat: Legal. 
Immigrants who are in the country legally are subject to the mandate and are eligible to shop on the exchanges. 
Thanks to the Supreme Court and Florida legislators, certain poor, legal noncitizens have it a little easier in Florida than the state's most impoverished citizens. The law includes a special rule (page 108) allowing them to get tax credits to purchase health insurance on an exchange if they (a) do not qualify for Medicaid because they have not been here for the required five years and (b) earn at or below the poverty line. 
Meanwhile, about 1 million of Florida’s poorest citizens will continue not to have affordable access to health insurance. They are not eligible to receive tax credits for the exchanges, and Florida leaders did not expand Medicaid coverage to include them during the 2013 legislative session. 
Goodhue calls it a ""black hole"" of coverage. 
Republican Gov. Jan Brewer had noticed a similar scenario playing out in Arizona if its leaders did not expand Medicaid, saying, ""For poor Arizonans below 100 percent of the federal poverty level, only legal immigrants, but not citizens, would be eligible for subsidies."" 
Our ruling 
The chain email says that Obamacare provides insurance ""to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally."" 
It’s actually citing a 2009 proposal that didn’t pass, but that doesn’t really matter. 
The email’s wrong either way. 
The Affordable Care Act does nothing to provide health insurance to anyone living in the United States illegally. It does offer some assistance to legal non-U.S. citizens, which by the way is different than a non-U.S. resident as the email claims. (A non-U.S. resident could be living in Mexico, France or even Mars).

Dan Stein says Senate immigration bill would add 70 million Americans over 20 years
","
As the immigration debate moves from the Senate to the House, supporters and opponents have been firing claims back and forth. A reader pointed us toward one claim raised by a critic of the bill on CBS’ Face the Nation. 
The ""so-called path to citizenship amnesty program is a fraction of what the deal bills with,"" said Dan Stein, who heads a group that opposes the bill, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, on July 7, 2013. ""Ultimately, it unleashes a massive increase in overall immigration ... . Essentially, it gives up on the American worker by simply suggesting that at every level of the labor market employers should be able to bring in foreign workers. We're talking about a population increase under the Senate bill of over 70 million people in 20 years -- 70 million people."" 
The reader wondered whether the bill really ""unleashes a massive increase in overall immigration"" of ""over 70 million people in 20 years."" In asking us to check the item, the reader noted that such an increase in the immigrant population would amount to a 22 percent increase over the current U.S. population estimate of 316.3 million, an increase the reader said ""sounds implausibly high."" 
As support for Stein’s claim, Eric Ruark, FAIR’s director of research, pointed us to a paper by the Center for Immigration Studies. While the center has strong opinions on immigration policy -- it’s generally skeptical of expanding immigration -- the group’s study used data from two sources without a dog in the fight, the Congressional Budget Office and the Census Bureau. 
The paper noted that CBO, in a recent analysis of the immigration bill, projected that the U.S. will have 16.2 million more people in 2033 as a result of the immigration bill than it would if Congress passed no changes to the immigration system. CBO said this is ""primarily because the legislation would loosen or eliminate annual limits on various categories of permanent and temporary immigration."" 
Meanwhile, the Census Bureau has projected that the U.S. population -- on its own, and in the absence of an immigration bill -- was already set to rise from 316.3 million in 2013 to 365.3 million in 2033. That’s an increase of 49 million. 
If you add these two numbers together, you get a roughly 65 million increase in population. That’s pretty close to Stein’s 70 million figure. 
Stein’s comments suggested to us, and to the reader who urged us to check the claim, that it’s the immigration bill that caused the 70 million increase. But that’s not the case. 
In reality, roughly three-quarters of the 65 million population increase from 2013 to 2033 comes not from additional immigrants crossing the border and having children on U.S. soil, but rather from Americans already legally on U.S. soil having kids, and from immigrants coming to the U.S. legally under current laws. The Senate bill wouldn’t affect this population growth at all. 
Several population experts told PolitiFact that they had problems with Stein’s claim. 
""I don't see where the 70 million would come from -- certainly not from the countries mostly responsible for undocumented migration,"" said Douglas Massey, a professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research. ""Together, Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras account for around three-fourths of all undocumented residents, but the combined population of these countries is only around 150 million. So 70 million (moving here) would represent 47 percent of their combined population, which is simply not credible."" 
In an interview, Steven A. Camarota, the author of the Center for Immigration Studies paper, declined to assess the adequacy of how Stein phrased the statistic. However, he said it’s not unreasonable to focus on the impact of immigration on the nation’s population growth, even if the number isn’t as high as 70 million. 
""The basic question remains: Is 16 million additional residents a lot?"" Camarota said. ""This is on top of the 19 million from current immigration levels. ...  The key question is what are the costs and benefits of significantly increasing the size and density of the U.S. population as a direct result of federal policy? The country lacks even a terse discussion of this issue."" 
Our ruling 
Stein said the Senate immigration bill ""unleashes a massive increase in overall immigration. … We're talking about a population increase under the Senate bill of over 70 million people in 20 years."" 
While credible estimates do say the U.S. population could grow by 65 million between 2013 and 2033, only about 16 million of that would be increases resulting from the Senate bill. The remaining 49 million, or three-quarters of the total, would come from natural population growth among people already in America and by immigration that’s deemed legal under today’s laws -- and thus would have nothing to do with whether the Senate bill passes or not.

Phil Burress says all major religions are against same-sex marriage
","
In two rulings on the final day of its 2012-2013 term, the U.S. Supreme Court struck downparts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the 1996 law that banned the government from recognizing same-sex marriages performed in states where they are legal, and let stand a lower court ruling that struck down a California gay marriage ban. 
The rulings left in place the laws that ban same-sex marriage in 37 states. Among them is Ohio. 
FreedomOhio, an advocacy group pushing to overturn Ohio's ban, said the high court's decisions add momentumto its effort to get the issue on the November 2014 ballot. 
Citizens for Community Values, a Cincinnati-based conservative group that championed the 2004 constitutional ban, said it was ready to fight measures that would bring same-sex marriage to the state. 
Phil Burress, president of the group, was quoted sayingin March that legalizing same-sex marriage in Ohio is unlikely: ""I can't look into the future, but I just don't ever see it happening. This nation was founded on Judeo-Christian principles, and, like Judeo-Christian beliefs, every major religion is opposed to same-sex marriage. You can't allow same-sex marriage until you destroy all religions."" 
While his last sentence is matter of opinion that PolitiFact Ohio can't rate, we wondered about the accuracy of his statement about religious opposition. 
The Supreme Court decisions affected the legal recognition of marriage under civil law. They do not extend to religious recognition. 
But what do religions say about same-sex marriage? 
Citizens for Community Valuestold us it stands behind the statement by Burress, which was also cited in a Plain Dealer story last month, and added: ""The mainstream, conservative and orthodox majorities of the primary religions in America, that is Judaism, Christianity and Islam, oppose same-sex marriage."" 
They referred us to a comprehensive survey of the U.S. religious landscapeby the nonpartisan Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. It details the country's current religious makeup and changes in religious affiliation. 
Pew also presents an overview of official positions on same-sex marriageamong major religions in the United States. These are the findings, summarized alphabetically: 
American Baptist Churches USA has affirmed that ""God's design for sexual intimacy places it within the context of marriage between one man and one woman."" 
Buddhism has no universal position on same-sex marriage. 
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops opposes same-sex marriage, affirming that ""marriage is a faithful, exclusive and lifelong union between one man and one woman."" 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not endorse same-sex marriage; Mormon theology says that ""marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God."" 
The General Convention of the Episcopal Church last year approved a liturgy for blessing same-sex relationships. ""Each Episcopal bishop will decide whether to allow churches in his or her jurisdiction to use the new liturgy to bless same-sex unions,"" Pew reports. ""And in those dioceses where blessing same-sex relationships is permissible, no Episcopal priest will be required to perform the blessing ceremony."" 
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America defines marriage as ""a lifelong covenant of faithfulness between a man and a woman,"" but allowed congregations to recognize and bless same-sex unions. 
Hinduism has no official position on same-sex marriage. 
Islamic law forbids homosexuality. 
In Judaism, the Reform and Reconstructionist Jewish movements support gay and lesbian rights, including same-sex marriage. The Conservative Jewish movement has a ceremony to allow same-sex couples to marry. Individual rabbis can choose not to officiate at same-sex weddings. 
Orthodox Judaism does not accept same-sex marriage. 
The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod's position is that same-sex marriage is ""contrary to the will of the Creator."" 
The National Association of Evangelicals does not support gay marriage or civil unions. 
The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman -- though, Pew notes, its General Assembly ""urged state legislatures to give individuals in same-gender relationships the right to be joined in civil unions."" 
The Southern Baptist Convention is opposed to gay marriage. 
The Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations passed a resolution in 1996 in support of same-sex marriage. 
The United Church of Christ’s General Synod has voted to legally recognize and advocate in favor of same-sex marriage. ""Given the autonomous nature of United Church of Christ churches,"" Pew reports, ""each congregation may adopt or reject the recommendations of the General Synod."" 
The United Methodist Church affirms that marriage is between a man and a woman. 
""Religious groups do not speak with one voice on the same-sex marriage issue,"" said a report in March from Religion & Ethics Newsweekly, ""but more oppose it than support it."" 
""Religious groups fall on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate,"" the Public Religion Research Institutereported in March. 
Burress would have been on solid ground stating that the majority of major religions do not approve same-sex marriage. The opposition is significant. Most of the biggest religious groups do not accept same-sex marriage. 
But ""most"" is not ""all."" The opposition is not unanimous. Views varywithin Judeo-Christian tradition. The number of denominations accepting same-sex marriage has been increasing.

Carter trips over details of gender wage gap
","
PolitiFact Georgia checked two previous claims former President Jimmy Carter made in a Time magazine interview before his ""Mobilizing Faith for Women"" conference last month at the Carter Center. 
Once the three-day conference began, various media outlets and bloggers reported some of the goings on. The Huffington Post, for example, wrote about one session in which Carter discussed mistreatment of women across the world and laid the blame, at least some of it, at the feet of religious leaders. 
One familiar statement about the pay disparity between men and women stuck out to us: 
Carter said women in the United States are paid about 70 percent of what men earn for the same work. Can that really be true? 
Our national and state affiliate PolitiFact colleagues have completed several fact checks of similar wage-disparity claims made by a variety of politicos including President Barack Obama. We dug a little deeper to determine where Carter’s claim ranked on the Truth-O-Meter. 
We tracked down the full statement in a 20-minute video of the former president and former Georgia governor’s comments on the Carter Center’s website. Carter’s comments on this subject begin around the 7:30 mark as he reads articles from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 23, he reads, says everyone, without any discrimination, has a right to equal pay for equal work. 
""And the employers of America looking at their religious ordination that women are not equal don't feel constrained to pay women equally for the same work that a man does,"" Carter continues. ""In our country, women get an average of 70 percent as much pay for doing exactly the same work as men."" 
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December 1948 after World War II as a road map to guarantee the rights of every individual everywhere, according to the UDHR’s website. 
Carter’s overall theme of an existing gender wage gap is correct. But his figure and characterization of that amount is a very different matter. 
We contacted Carter’s camp about his source for the claim. It noted the U.N. 2012 report, ""Progress of the World’s Women: In Pursuit of Justice."" But that report cites an international pay gap of 10 percent to 30 percent for 83 countries polled, and it doesn’t provide a percentage for the United States. 
The report does say that the wage gaps reflect the fact that women doing the same or comparable jobs are paid less than men for the same work. The report is based on a 2008 International Labour Organization data. 
Nationally, the 70 percent figure seems to track back to a 2011 census report that found that in 2010, the female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers over age 15 was 0.77; meaning that women earned 77 cents for every dollar a man earned. That statistic has been used repeatedly as an argument for equal pay and gender non-discrimination legislation. 
But the statistic has also been widely misused by speakers oversimplifying the data. The report does not say the 77-cent figure is for the same work. And the full-time definition for different jobs can vary widely. 
Also, the pay gap does not take into account other factors that could influence the figure, including occupation, time on the job and education level. The census report showed the widest gap. Other data -- including hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as, data comparing the same jobs -- yield smaller gaps. 
The 70 percent figure, also taken from census data, is the wage disparity between men and African-American women. Again, the figure was based on full-time, year-round workers in general, and it did not compare similar occupations. The wage gap increased to 64 percent (or 64 cents to every dollar) between black women and white, non-Hispanic men. 
So, does Carter’s claim earn an honest day’s pay? 
During a conference on women, Carter said that women in this country earn just 70 percent of what men earn for ""doing exactly  the same work as men."" 
His main source document provides information on an international, not a national wage gap. And for this country, the figure Carter uses is actually the wage gap between all men and black women. It has nothing to do with men and women who do the same work, contrary to what he stated. 
Even if we assume Carter misspoke and meant 77 percent -- the most widely used wage gap figure from a recent census report -- his claim would still leave out important details about the census data that would give an entirely different impression had they been included. 
The former president and Nobel Prize winner does get some credit for his overall theme that a general pay gap persists between men and women, a fact that has been proved by various sets of national data.
