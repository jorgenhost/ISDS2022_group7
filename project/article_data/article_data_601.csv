Wolf Blitzer: Ted Nugent used Nazi terminology, 'subhuman mongrel,' to describe President Barack Obama
","Ted Nugent may have made his name as a rock musician, but today he increasingly is known for his controversial comments about President Barack Obama. At a January gun expo in Las Vegas, Nugent described Obama as ""a communist-raised, communist-educated, communist-nurtured, subhuman mongrel."" Nugent now is campaigning with Texas Republican gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott. This led CNN’s Wolf Blitzer to question whether the Abbott campaign understands the history of such language. (Abbott has not distanced himself from Nugent.) ""That’s what the Nazis called Jews to justify the genocide of the Jewish community,"" Blitzer said in a Feb. 18, 2014, interview. ""They called them untermenschen, subhuman mongrels. If you read some of the literature that the Nazis put out there, there is a long history of that specific phrase he used involving the president of the United States."" Blitzer’s interview made waves through the political world, so we wanted to check his assertion about the words ""subhuman mongrel."" In his CNN interview, Blitzer cited the work of Nazi party official Julius Streicher. But our research shows Blitzer is correct well beyond an individual Nazi party official. The words subhuman and mongrel were used interchangeably but generally had the same derogatory meaning.  David Myers, a historian at the University of California at Los Angeles, said Adolph Hitler used the word ""untermensch"" or subhuman in his book Mein Kampf in 1925. ""From that point forward, it was part of the Nazi lexicon,"" Myers said. ""That and ‘mischling’ or mongrel, were intoned with daily regularity by the Nazi propaganda machine."" The man Blitzer mentioned, Streicher, was an early Nazi party leader in Nuremberg and Franconia and a fierce anti-Semite. In the mid 1920s, he began publishing a tabloid aimed at the working class called Der Sturmer, ""The Attacker."" The front of each edition carried the slogan, ""The Jews are our misfortune."" In 1935, Der Sturmer carried a student essay that parrotted the teaching materials in the classroom. Here is the English translation: ""Regrettably, there are still many people today who say: Even the Jews are creatures of God. Therefore you must respect them. But we say: Vermin are animals too, but we exterminate them just the same. The Jew is a mongrel. He has hereditary tendencies from Aryans, Asiatics, Negroes, and from the Mongolians. Evil always preponderates in the case of a mongrel."" In 1899, the English anti-Semite Houston Stewart Chamberlain wrote extensively about physical characteristics and race. He claimed ""the Semites belong to the mulatto class, a transition stage between black and white"" and were ""a mongrel race which always retains this mongrel character."" In 1942, the Nazis printed an infamous pamphlet, Der Untermensch, which translates to ""subhuman."" The Holocaust Research Project translation provides this front panel quote from the head of the German SS, Heinrich Himmler: ""As long as there have been men on the Earth, the struggle between man and the subhuman will be the historic rule; the Jewish-led struggle against the mankind, as far back as we can look, is part of the natural course of life on our planet. One can be convinced with full certainty that this struggle for life and death is just as much a law of nature as is the struggle of an infection to corrupt a healthy body."" Mark Roseman, director of the Borns Jewish Studies Program at Indiana University, said the German word for subhuman, untermensch, did not tend to be used by the Nazis in the adjectival form. So the words weren't often used in combination. ""But the underlying claim, namely, that Nazi policies were preceded, facilitated, and accompanied by language that compared Jews to animals, and declared them to be subhuman, is of course absolutely correct,"" Roseman said. Our ruling Blitzer said the words ""subhuman mongrel"" were used by the Nazis to ""justify the genocide of the Jewish community."" We found ample evidence that the Nazis used those words -- in their own language -- to repeatedly describe Jewish people in the build-up to the Holocaust.

MSNBC's Ed Schultz: When union membership drops, so do wages
","In the days before workers rejected an attempt to unionize a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., MSNBC host and union supporter Ed Schultz attempted to underscore what he thought was at stake. ""If it fails, it could be a major setback for workers all across this country,"" Schultz told viewers. Schultz then pointed to a chart showing two lines that headed down over time. One was the percentage of union workers and the other was, in his words, ""middle class income."" ""Quite the parallel there, isn’t there?"" Schultz said. ""When union membership goes down, so do wages. This vote is a pivotal moment for union workers in this country."" Schultz, who did not respond to our requests for comment, is right to point out that union membership affects wages. But his wording takes things a little too far. We’ll explain why in this fact-check. How unions affect wages We found the chart that Schultz had on his show. It comes from the Center for American Progress, a liberal advocacy group, and shows the percentage of union workers falling from about 28 percent in 1967 to about 11 percent today. In the same period, the share of the nation’s income going to the middle 60 percent of households declined from 52.3 percent to 45.7 percent. That seems to support Schultz’s claim, but actually it doesn’t prove his point. First, he talked about wages and the chart talks about the share of the national income, which is different. One is money in your pocket and the other is money in your pocket compared to the money in rich peoples’ pockets. In fact, according to the Pew Research Center, a reliable source of neutral number crunching, household median income rose between 1967 and 2012 by about $7,000 after accounting for inflation. If you want to find the strongest evidence for Schultz’s statement, you have to look at the wages for men. Work by economists Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney finds median wages for men slipped slightly starting in 1970 and have remained stagnant ever since. But while wages and union membership might have fallen (or flatlined) at the same time, it doesn’t mean one caused the other. That’s where independent research picks up. Most analysts have looked at Schultz’s claim from another angle, by seeing if unions raise wages. The research shows generally, yes. We found near consensus that unions tend to deliver higher pay for their members. ""Unions raise wages for people in the middle of the skills distribution about 10 to 15 percent,"" said David Card, one of the leading economists in this field at the University of California-Berkeley. Card’s work is full of daunting equations and statistical techniques, but within those, he teases out the role a person’s skill level plays. Card has found that people with higher skills are less inclined to join unions and that union employers tend to avoid lower-skilled workers. That means the biggest impacts of unions are felt among people in the middle. Another leading researcher, David Macpherson at Trinity University, uses data from the federal government’s Current Population Survey to produce a database called Unionstats.com. In the latest numbers for 2013, Macpherson finds unions play a larger role in shaping wages in the private sector than in the government sector. ""The union premium is about 20 percent in the private sector,"" Macpherson said. ""While in the public sector, it’s about 9 percent."" Any number, however, has caveats and is imprecise, economists told us. They point to holes in the data and the challenge of separating the impact of unions compared to other macroeconomic forces, such as global competition. There’s also evidence the union effect has dropped over time. Still, according to the experts we reached, unions are good for their members. For the record, economist John DiNardo at the University of Michigan studied companies where unionization votes -- both for and against -- were very close. DiNardo found that it didn’t really matter whether workers approved or rejected unions. Wages in both kinds of companies followed the same path. Where Schultz goes too far So there is broad consensus that unions are typically good for people who join them in that it results in increased wages. But Schultz’s claim was broader than that. He said that when union membership goes down, people not only lose the potential to earn more -- their wages drop. And that happens regardless of whether you had the chance to join a union or not. That’s a trickier claim to substantiate, but there are some theories on how that could happen. Labor economist Richard Freeman at Harvard University speaks of the ""threat effect"", that is, when non-union employers raise wages to avoid a successful union vote by their workers. Freeman found evidence of companies raising wages to undermine union growth in the 1950s and 1960s when unions were strong. But today is a different story, he said. ""To go from those situations and show they affect the whole economy is a stretch,"" Freeman said. ""Schultz's claim is plausible, and it may be right, but we don't really know the magnitude of the spillover."" Other powerful forces are also at play, Freeman said. Global competition and much greater use of technology hurt some workers and helped others. There is no consensus on the role unions by themselves played over the decades. On one end, there is the work of Macpherson and his colleagues. Macpherson looked at how much of the nation’s total income went to workers since the mid 1960s. It has gone up a bit and down a bit, but generally it held steady even as the percentage of union workers fell. ""I don’t see any evidence that wages across the board went down as union membership declined,"" Macpherson said. But Macpherson’s data didn’t look at the distribution of those wages. A CEO’s pay was mixed in with that of a store clerk. Other researchers have focused on how pay is spread around. Sociologists Jake Rosenfeld at the University of Washington and Bruce Western at Harvard concluded that men who work full-time would be doing appreciably better if union membership hadn’t fallen since the 1970s. How much better? Rosenfeld said if more men -- again, it’s the male workers -- had belonged to unions, their yearly wages would have increased about $2,600. Card at the University of California had similar results. ""The decline in unionization has reduced wages for people in the middle relative to those in the top,"" Card said. Setting aside the matter of unions and income inequality, here is one point on which Rosenfeld, Macpherson and Freeman generally agree. The impact of unions depends heavily on the nature of the work and where it takes place. When unions are strong in a particular industry and a particular region, Rosenfeld said it raises the bar and non-union managers tend to mimic their neighbors. ""If that (other) firm happens to be union, then you're paying union-level wages regardless of whether your company is organized,"" Rosenfeld said. ""Was Ed Schultz right to say that 'when union membership goes down, so do wages?' "" Rosenfeld said. ""Sure -- for union members and for those non-members who worked in areas and occupations where labor was strong. For everyone across the whole economy? Probably not."" Our ruling Schultz said when union membership goes down, so do wages. Schultz emphasized that ""all workers"" have a stake in this and his chart tied union membership to the income of everyone in the middle class. Schultz would have done better to have talked about the distribution of income rather than wages. His claim is most likely to be true for male union workers and only partly true for non-union workers. Even for union workers, other factors such as globalization and technology have diminished the union effect. The ability of unions to push up wages for workers outside the union is limited to certain industries that operate in the same region. Schultz’s statement has a measure of truth but in today’s economy, the data don’t support the strong tie he suggests between unions and wages overall. We rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/feb/18/ed-schultz/schultz-go-unions-so-go-wages/

Reed: Metro Atlanta a financial behemoth
","The Atlanta region has drawn millions of newcomers here in recent years with its warm weather (snowstorms notwithstanding), reasonably priced housing, and job opportunities in real estate, banking and the airline industry. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed talked about the economic might of the region during a recent speech before the Atlanta Press Club. One statistic he used to cite the size of metro Atlanta’s economy surprised us, so we decided to do some fact-checking. The annual gross domestic product of metro Atlanta, the mayor said, is ""bigger than 28 states in the union."" Is it really that large? Mayoral spokesman Carlos Campos said Reed was using U.S. Commerce Department data as the basis for his claim. We looked at the data, and the most recent statistics we found show the mayor’s statement might be conservative. Gross domestic product, or GDP, is the total market value of all of the goods and services produced within the boundaries of a specific area. Federal officials define the Atlanta metropolitan area as 28 counties that stretch as far north as Dawson, south to Meriwether, as far west as Haralson and as far east as Walton and Jasper counties. It includes Georgia’s four highest-populated counties: Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett. The Atlanta metropolitan area had nearly 5.3 million residents in 2010, the ninth-highest total in the nation. In addition to having a large labor force, metro Atlanta has two major transportation hubs that have helped its economy race ahead of other regions. One is Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, which ranks among the world’s busiest airports. The other is the ports of Savannah and Brunswick, which are considered to be among the fastest-growing ports in terms of the volume of items shipped there. Although the ports are not located in metro Atlanta, Reed and others note they are important to the region’s economy. About 180,000 full-time and part-time jobs in the 28-county Atlanta region can be attributed to the ports, according to a 2012 University of Georgia study. The region has 11 Fortune 500 companies with Atlanta addresses, according to the Metro Atlanta Chamber. Only New York City and Houston have more Fortune 500 businesses, according to the chamber. So how large is this region’s economy? In 2012, the Atlanta region had a GDP of nearly $295 billion, according to the Commerce Department. Reed used that same number in his remarks. Among metropolitan areas, Atlanta’s GDP is the 10th-highest nationally, which is about where it should be considering it has the ninth-largest population. In order, the metropolitan areas with the largest gross domestic products are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Washington, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Boston. In terms of how Atlanta fares in comparison with other states, only 16 states had a higher GDP. In order, those states were California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Washington, Maryland, Indiana and Minnesota. Metro Atlanta would also beat out the rest of the state. The region makes up about two-thirds of the state’s GDP, the Commerce Department data show. The Atlanta region does have a larger population than the rest of the state. PolitiFact Georgia looked at other categories of gross domestic product, and the Atlanta region fared as well, if not better, in those areas. For example, in 2012, only 12 states had a higher per capita GDP than metro Atlanta. The per capita gross domestic product for metro Atlanta was $46,970. University of Georgia economist Jeff Humphreys said he’s not surprised metro Atlanta has a higher GDP than most states. ""Atlanta is a huge metro area,"" said Humphreys, the director of the university’s Selig Center for Economic Growth. ""The population would outrank a lot of states."" Indeed, metro Atlanta has a larger population than 30 other states, U.S. census figures show. Humphreys said the Atlanta region has a ""highly developed economy"" through economic resources such as the airport that are ""serving people in other states, the country and the world at this point."" To sum up, Reed claimed the Atlanta region had a higher GDP than 28 other states. Our research showed Atlanta slightly better than that in most categories.

David Jolly 'supports privatizing Social Security,' Democrats say
","Issues affecting seniors continue to drive a lot of the attack ads in the race to fill the seat held by the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young. One of the more persistent claims lately has been Democratic accusations that David Jolly wants to fundamentally change Social Security. In a robocall that began targeting Pinellas County’s independent seniors on Feb. 6, 2014, the Florida Democratic Party reinforces the attack. ""Lobbyist Jolly also supports privatizing Social Security, which could force seniors to gamble with their retirement on the stock market, and Jolly even praised the Ryan Budget that turns Medicare into a costly voucher program,"" a woman’s voice says during the call. We’ve been over claims about Jolly’s actions on Medicare and the Ryan budget before, but does he want to privatize Social Security? This sound bite ends up being quite a mouthful. Securing Jolly’s platform Former congressional aide-turned-lobbyist Jolly has faced repeated attacks over his past advocacy of other issues before. Part of the evidence for this claim is that one of his old clients, Free Enterprise Nation, was run by a man named James MacDougald. Jolly in 2009 lobbied U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., for issues relating to Medicare and Social Security -- namely that future years of debt aren’t readily apparent to taxpayers, according to the Republican candidate. He listed only ""Social Security Reform"" as one of the topics of the meeting on a lobbying disclosure form. His campaign said he was ""critical of the Ryan budget"" in the meeting with the congressman. Ryan’s budget plans over the years called for revamping the Social Security Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program by allowing workers younger than 55 to divert some of their contributions from Social Security to voluntary personal savings accounts. The money in the accounts would be invested, overseen by the government, instead of paying for current retiree benefits. MacDougald has favored a similar approach, calling for a ""defined contribution"" plan for anyone younger than 50. That means the government would make a set contribution to workers, who then would have investment options. (MacDougald is now Jolly’s campaign finance co-chairman.) Jolly has said he doesn’t support this idea, but ""anybody that has an intellectually honest conversation knows we have to have long-term entitlement reform in order to balance the budget."" He told the Tampa Bay Times that in any such discussion, in the newspaper’s paraphrasing, ""everything should be on the table, including private accounts in which workers make their own investment decisions, as well as the important role of Social Security as a safety net."" Democrats have subsequently used the wording as proof Jolly supports privatization. ""David Jolly has been very clear on his position that he supports preserving Social Security,"" campaign spokeswoman Sarah Bascom said in a statement. ""In fact, that is one of the reasons he is on record saying he would not have voted for the Ryan budget because of certain changes to the Social Security program."" Democrats are making hay about the fact that Jolly said ""there was a lot of good in the Ryan budget"" during the Dec. 8, 2013, edition of Bay News 9’s Political Connections. That portion of the quote doesn’t tell the whole story, however. ""I think we have to be careful on the Ryan budget for a couple of reasons,"" he said on the show. ""Entitlement programs — Social Security, Medicare — we know what that means to the community here. I have said from the very beginning, we have to protect the promises that have been made, to everybody."" When pressed about whether he would have voted for the budget proposal with House Republicans, Jolly said he ""would have to examine the details of the Ryan plan."" He has also referred to his position in a Feb. 3, 2014, interview on Tampa Bay TV station WFLA. ""On Social Security and Medicare, I came out very early, in a Republican primary, full of Republican conservative voters, and suggested one, I would have voted against the Ryan plan,"" he said. ""And two, I believe we do have to protect benefits not just for current beneficiaries, but for those who have already vested into the program as a result of working 40 quarters."" A quarter of coverage is a period of time based on a worker’s total wages or income over the year. A maximum of four quarters can be earned per year, and 40 quarters must be earned to become fully vested (or ""fully insured,"" as the Social Security Administration calls it) for retirement benefits. That means a worker would have to put in a minimum of 10 years in the employment pool to qualify for full benefits, if they earned all four quarters in a year. So generally speaking, Jolly is saying he wants to particularly protect those who have worked for 10 years, while looking at changes for young workers. Jolly told the Tampa Bay Times editorial board in a Dec. 9, 2013, meeting before the primary that he supported keeping Social Security and Medicare the same except for the youngest workers. Jolly referred to similar phrasing in a Feb. 3 debate with Democratic opponent Alex Sink and Libertarian hopeful Lucas Overby, adding ""long-term entitlement reform is the only way to reach a balanced budget."" Our ruling Democrats say Jolly ""supports privatizing Social Security,"" using a paraphrased statement that private accounts should be on the table in discussing future reforms. They also point to the fact Jolly had a meeting with Ryan to discuss the program. Jolly says he’s been very clear where he stands on Social Security, but we don’t think it’s all that apparent. Saying private accounts should be an option doesn’t denote advocacy, but rather a willingness to explore options. Which option Jolly favors isn’t so clear, beyond setting some kind of benefit guarantee for people who have already qualified for Social Security or are currently receiving payments. He hasn’t said whether private accounts were at the top of his list of potential fixes, only that they should be considered. Democrats are attempting to make it sound like he is 100 percent behind the idea, but don’t offer any proof beyond a paraphrased statement. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/feb/17/florida-democratic-party/democrats-say-david-jolly-david-jolly-supports-pri/

Rep. Mark Pocan says the ice fishing season is shorter because of global warming
","Severe cold snaps followed by snowstorms and then another blast of cold. For many, this Wisconsin winter can’t end soon enough. So when U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, took to the floor of the House of Representatives on Jan. 16, 2014, a speech about global warming was the last thing many folks wanted to hear. Pocan, a member of the House’s Safe Climate Caucus, spent his one-minute speech ticking off what he said were clear signs of climate change. This claim caught our attention: ""Ice fishermen are already noticing fewer days they can be out on our ice covered lakes."" It feels like Wisconsin has been frozen solid for months, and many folks wouldn’t be surprised to see ice fishermen tromping around on Memorial Day. But Pocan’s claim is about more than this winter. His statement is about long-term trends and what is driving them. Is he right about climate change and fewer days on ice-covered lakes? When we asked Pocan for backup for the claim, his staff pointed us to Climatewisconsin.org, a web site that highlights research and reports prepared by environmental groups. The site includes interactive features that focus on the two largest lakes in Madison -- Mendota and Monona. It includes the amount of time they have been covered by ice in past years. ""The records show significant year-to-year variability in the length of the ice-cover season, but there is a clear trend of fewer ice-cover days over time,"" the site says. ""Overall, the average number of days of ice cover on the Madison lakes has decreased by around 29-35 days over the past 150 years. Significantly, the longest ice seasons on record are all clustered in the first few years of the record, while most of the shortest seasons fall towards the end of the record."" The site also includes this statement, which is pretty similar to that made by Pocan: ""With climate change models predicting warmer temperatures, we can expect to see a trend towards fewer days of ice-covered lakes as each year passes. In fact, with the aid of a remarkable dataset from Madison’s lakes, scientists infer that a change in ice duration has already taken place."" Information posted on the site comes, at least in part, from the work of John J. Magnuson, Emeritus Professor of Zoology and Limnology, who has been at UW since the late 1960s and helped found the UW-Madison Center for Limnology in the early 1980s. Limnology is the study of freshwater lakes, and the UW center says it’s the birthplace of the field of study, dating back to the 1870s. Magnuson is an expert on the effects of climate change on freshwater lakes, and has published numerous academic papers on the effect of climate change on lakes and fish. In an interview, Magnuson said researchers around the world, including Canada, Finland, Sweden, Russia, Japan and Madison, have studied lake ice for years. Researchers note the day lakes freeze and the day the ice goes out. It’s a more official version of what is waged in a less academic way by lakefront bars that stage ice-out guessing contests. Madison researchers have records for Mendota and Monona that go back to 1855. The long term trend for Lake Mendota is that, on average since 1855, there are 29 fewer days that the lake is covered with ice, according to Magnuson. Six of the shortest seasons for Mendota have been in the years since 1980. Five have been since 1995, including the two shortest seasons ever -- 21 days in the winter of 2001-02 and 47 days in 1997-98. Lake Monona has seen on average of 35 fewer ice-covered days, and also has seen a cluster of shorter seasons in recent years. ""The breakup of the ice is occurring, on average, two weeks earlier. And the freezing of the lakes have come two weeks later, on average,"" Magnuson said. ""The result is that four months of ice is reduced to about three months."" To be sure, Wisconsin has some 15,000 lakes, and we cannot check each one. ""This is highly variable with every water body having different characteristics, and is obviously very weather dependent as well,"" said Thomas Van Haren, of the state Department of Natural Resources Bureau of Law Enforcement. But it seems reasonable to focus on Lake Monona and Mendota given their size and because they are in Pocan’s district. So what about this throwback winter? Magnuson said it’s a statistical blip. Some years the ice stays around longer than others, but over time the trend has been toward shorter ice seasons. ""The variability is very high"" in terms of the length of the seasons, he said. ""Not only does lake ice respond to the warming climate, it also responds to local weather."" Lake Mendota iced over Dec. 16, 2013 -- about a month earlier than the previous year and four days earlier than the median date. Lake Monona froze Dec. 10, 2013, compared with Dec. 31 the previous year and a median date of Dec. 15. National Weather Service records from the weather office in Sullivan indicate this was the 9th coldest winter on record, so far, in Madison, and the coldest in 35 years. The average temperature was 15.8 degrees below normal. ""This is the sort of winter that’s typical of 50 or 100 years ago,"" Magnuson said. Going global So what about the connection Pocan made between shorter ice fishing seasons and climate change? Magnuson said the shorter seasons are a symptom of global warming -- one consistent with many others, such as changed bird and butterfly migration patterns, plants that bloom earlier, and disappearing glaciers. ""We can’t take this ice data and say ‘therefore we say greenhouse gas is causing this,’"" he said. ""That’s a question for the atmospheric physicists. Our data is consistent with what other people are finding, with the kind of things that atmospheric scientists are seeing from C02."" He added: ""There’s abundant evidence that it’s getting warmer and that spring is coming sooner."" Unfortunately, he’s talking about long-term trends. Not what is going to happen this year. Our rating It’s been a longer and colder winter than in recent years. But that doesn’t erase a trend that’s been well-established. The number of days that the lakes have ice on them -- making them safe for ice fishing -- has declined.

McAuliffe says 70 percent of medically uninsured live in working households
","Gov. Terry McAuliffe is urging the General Assembly to expand Virginia’s Medicaid program, in part, because it would help the working poor. ""Seventy percent of all uninsured live in households in which at least one person is working,"" he said last month in an address to the legislature. When we asked where the figure came from, McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy sent us a presentation used by the Virginia Health Care Foundation, a non-profit organization seeking to increase access to health care for the uninsured. The percentage was computed in 2011 by the Urban Institute, a research organization. There’s a slight caveat McAuliffe did not explain. The 70 percent figure applies to people up to the age 64, as most people older than that are part of Medicare and, therefore, insured. The analysis divided workers into two categories: Those working more than 35 hours per week were deemed full-time; while those working 35 hours or less per week were deemed part-time. Of the uninsured living in Virginia: That adds up to 70.3 percent of uninsured Virginians living in a household where at least one person is working. For perspective, roughly 1 million Virginians are uninsured -- about 12 percent of the population. Our ruling McAuliffe said 70 percent of medically uninsured Virginians live in households where at least one person works. His figure is backed by research from the Urban Institute and we were unable to find any contradictory study.

Panelists on ABC's 'This Week' ask PunditFact for help sorting out presidential trivia
","That big dump of snow that hit the East Coast this week put the Sunday talk shows in a weather state of mind -- that and President Barack Obama linking extreme events to climate change when he spoke in California. The serious side got an airing in a discussion on ABC’s This Week, but so did the trivial. Host George Stephanopoulos gave the show’s panel of pundits a pop quiz. The question: ""Which president's inauguration was held in the Senate chambers because of a blizzard?"" (A blizzard means sustained wind or frequent gusts to 35 miles an hour or greater and considerable falling and/or blowing snow.) Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan and ABC's Jonathan Karl both answered Ronald Reagan, while Fusion's Alicia Menendez and The Nation's Katrina vanden Heuvel had no answer. ""Reagan was very cold but that wasn't the one -- William Howard Taft,"" Stephanopoulos said. While Menendez said that was going to be her guess, Noonan wanted to stick her answer. ""Reagan's second inaugural was moved inside the Capitol. It was. Because of a terrible snowstorm,"" Noonan said. ""PolitiFact time,"" vanden Heuvel jumped in. How could we not leap to respond? Our source is the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a body that since 1901 has planned and run the swearing-in ceremonies for each president. The committee’s website is testimony that there’s a place for everything on the Internet; the site includes its own tab just for weather. For the curious, it was clear and cool when George Washington took the oath of office in New York City in April 1789. To Noonan’s assertion, Reagan’s second oath of office in 1985 took place in the Capitol rotunda. She was wrong about the snowstorm but she certainly knew that the event was held inside. According to the congressional committee, event planners had good reason for the switch. ""It was sunny, but bitter cold. Wind chill temperatures fell into the -10°F to -20°F range in the afternoon. Estimated noon temperature of 7°F."" Actually, Reagan also took the oath the day before, on a Sunday, in the Grand Foyer of the the White House. Noonan might be expected to hold on to these details. She was one of Reagan’s main speechwriters. Stephanopoulos, meanwhile, was completely right about Taft. It was March 1909, and a blizzard forced the ceremony inside, and it was held in the Senate chamber. The storm dropped 10 inches of snow and packed winds that toppled trees and telephone poles.

Steve Forbes says two-thirds of people who earn the minimum wage get a raise within 1 year
","President Barack Obama made good on his State of the Union promise to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10 starting in 2015. But he doesn’t have the executive power to do the same for all workers, so the debate among the White House, Congress, economists and business leaders continues. CNN State of the Union host Candy Crowley asked Steve Forbes, chairman and editor-in-chief of Forbes Media, if raising the minimum wage would be good or bad for the bottom line, economically speaking. ""Remember, in terms of minimum wage, they are often with businesses with small margins, and two-thirds of the people who start out in minimum wage are above the minimum wage within a year, when they get skills,"" said Forbes, a former Republican presidential candidate. We’ll leave it to the economists to debate whether or not raising the minimum wage would help or hurt these workers. PunditFact wanted to know if two-thirds of minimum wage workers do start earning more within a year. Forbes didn’t return our request for comment. We found two papers that directly address his claim. In 2004, economists William Even and David Macpherson published their findings for the Employment Policies Institute, a fiscally conservative nonprofit think tank. Using federal labor statistics from the Current Population Survey, they did find that about two-thirds of workers see wage growth within a year. However, since that’s pre-recession data, we’ll place more emphasis on a 2013 report. Two Texas A&M University economics professors, Jonathan Meer and Jeremy West, updated Even and Macpherson’s findings using the same data source from 1979 to 2012. Meer and West reported the following trends of minimum wage workers: 16.55 percent leave the labor force 5.85 percent become unemployed Of those that remained in the workforce, Meer and West found that 65.85 percent receive higher wages the next year. So it’s not that two-thirds of minimum wage workers earn more money the following year. It’s two-thirds of those who continue to work, or 51 percent of all minimum wage workers. Minimum wage earners may choose to leave the labor force because they figure they can do about as well without a paycheck, but with government benefits, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economics professor. There’s a lot of flow in and out of the labor market that complicates Forbes’ claim, she said. Sinclair also pointed out that there’s selection at play in this statistic. Individuals who keep their minimum-wage jobs for one year are proving that they’re dedicated employees who can hold down jobs. That might speak more to why they’re getting a raise than anything else, Sinclair said. Our ruling Forbes said two-thirds of people working for the minimum wage earn more money within a year. The real figure is 51 percent, because some people leave the labor force or lose their job. Forbes’ claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/feb/16/steve-forbes/steve-forbes-says-two-thirds-people-who-earn-minim/

Top Rhode Island Democrat says Republicans in U.S. House have not passed a jobs bill
","In this era of high unemployment, it's always about jobs. The issue came up again Jan. 31 when Jonathan Boucher, executive director of the Rhode Island Democratic Party, published a commentary in The Providence Journal attacking the argument by Republican Ian Prior that the state needs Republicans in its congressional delegation, now all Democratic. Boucher argued that the idea of ""replacing our delegation with a bunch of Republican freshmen,"" which wasn't exactly Prior's argument, ""is completely absurd."" ""The House Republicans’ failure and inability to govern caused the first government shutdown in 16 years. The Republican leadership in the House has refused to address the issues that matter the most to Rhode Island, such as passing a jobs bill, extending unemployment benefits, raising the minimum wage, and passing comprehensive immigration reform."" In that list of alleged GOP failures, one stood out to a reader, who emailed us a list of jobs bills that, he said, the Republican-controlled House has, in fact, passed. We were intrigued and decided to see whether Boucher's jobs claim was correct. The list has lots of bills with the word ""jobs"" in the title, but that doesn't mean the proposals would actually create jobs. In addition, Republicans and Democrats tend to have different views on what constitutes a ""jobs bill."" For Democrats, that can mean legislation expanding or creating a government training program. For Republicans, that can mean bills shrinking government or eliminating regulations to help businesses. We decided to use a technique employed by PolitiFact National when it looked at a claim made on Facebook in 2011 that congressional Republicans have introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, but ""zero on job creation,"" a claim that earned a Pants on Fire. We went to Congress.gov, run by the Library of Congress. It lists the topics that a bill covers. We looked for topics related to employment and job creation. It's not a perfect gauge, but it's a nonpartisan guide. We also reviewed summaries of the bills and committee reports looking for references to jobs and employment. For example, the SKILLS Act (H.R. 803), intended to streamline work-force development programs, touches on 52 topics from ""tobacco use"" to ""sex offenses."" But it also has provisions that deal with ""labor and employment,"" ""unemployment,"" ""temporary and part-time employment,"" ""vocational education"" and ""youth employment and child labor."" It passed the House on March 15, 2013. The ""Veterans Economic Opportunity Act of 2013"" (H.R. 2481) deals with veterans education, employment and rehabilitation. It passed the House on a voice vote on Oct. 28, 2013. And the ""Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2013"" (H.R. 2052) is intended to get the feds to come up with a plan for increasing ""U.S. global competitiveness without weakening labor, consumer, financial, or environmental protections."" It passed the House in a bipartisan vote on Sept. 9, 2013. Some jobs bills were designed to create jobs by encouraging more energy production and distribution, such as proposals to expand offshore oil drilling or push the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which gives some environmentalists heartburn. Others on the list from our GOP reader seemed to have little to do with directly promoting employment, and Congress.gov doesn't list them in any employment-related categories. When we emailed the list of ""jobs"" legislation to Boucher, he took issue with some of the bills, saying they weren’t really about jobs. Boucher also argued that his statement is true because none of the Republican jobs-related legislation had been enacted. ""When I wrote 'passing a jobs bill,' I was clearly referring to a bill that has passed into law,"" he said in an email statement. ""A bill can’t create a single job if it’s not actually passed into law."" But that's not what he said in his commentary. He said, ""The Republican leadership in the House has refused to address the issues that matter the most to Rhode Island, such as passing a jobs bill."" The House, regardless of which party is in control, cannot unilaterally enact laws. Approval by the Senate and (in most cases) the president are also required. The bottom line: The House, under the current Republican leadership, has passed bills with the goal of encouraging employment. Whether one thinks that the bills will do more harm than good is a matter for debate, and beyond the scope of this fact check. Boucher's statement is wrong, enough for a ruling of False. But because he's making a ridiculous defense to justify it, we rate it Pants on Fire!

The new version provides greater context for Mayor Dwight Jones’ statement, but does not change our original ruling of False.  Mayor Dwight Jones opened his annual State of the City Address quoting from the popular travel guide Frommer’s, which touted Richmond’s outdoor offerings and craft beer scene as reasons it recommends the capital as a top travel destination this year. ""What they’re saying is something that we already know: That Richmond is a cool place to live, work and play,"" Jones said. Later in the speech, Jones cited additional Richmond accolades, and one particularly caught our attention. ""We are the most vegan-friendly city,"" he said, drawing chuckles from the audience. Has the old confederate capital become become the Mecca for people who abstain from all animal products? Lettuce take a look. Tammy Hawley, the mayor’s spokeswoman, pointed us to 2013 ratings by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a group that promotes meat-free diets and opposes animal testing. PETA ranked U.S. cities based on ""availability of vegan options"" as well as the ""influence of vegan culture,"" said Lindsay Rahat, the group’s associate director of campaigns.  Richmond won kudos for being ""packed with meat-free restaurants"" and hosting an annual vegetarian festival. But those accolades did not result in Richmond winning the vegan-friendly crown. In fact, Richmond was ranked 10th. The top spot went to Austin, Texas, in the heart of cattle country. Also ranked ahead of Richmond were Portland, Ore.; Los Angeles; New York; Chicago; Seattle; Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and Boulder, Colo. In trumpeting Richmond’s other accolades, Jones accurately noted that various groups have included Virginia’s capital in Top 10 lists of cities that are the best place to work and live, the most creative, the best place for jobs and have the best outdoors. But in addition to botching Richmond’s vegan standing, the mayor erred on two other ratings: *He touted Richmond as the ""happiest city for young professionals"" based on a 2011 posting by Careerbliss, an online jobs site. Richmond was 15th on the list. *He said Richmond is the ""healthiest city for women,"" although it actually ranked 51st in a 2011 survey by Self Magazine. Our ruling Jones said Richmond is the ""most vegan friendly city."" The source he cited, however, rated Richmond 10th in providing animal-free food. We don’t doubt Jones’ contention that Richmond is ""cool."" When it comes to vegans, Richmond may be hospitable, but it has not been rated the friendliest city for them. So we rate the mayor’s claim False.",/factchecks/2014/feb/14/dwight-jones/mayor-jones-says-richmond-rated-most-vegan-friendl/

Since 1988, Wisconsin unemployment rate greater than U.S. rate only when Mary Burke held state commerce post, GOP says
","Republicans have made it clear that between now and the November 2014 gubernatorial election, they will be reminding voters about Democratic former Gov. Jim Doyle -- who has been out of office, and largely out of sight, for more than three years. They are casting Doyle as an ineffectual, or worse, chief executive and tying him to Gov. Scott Walker's main challenger, Democrat Mary Burke. On Feb. 4, 2014, the state Republican Party issued a news release attacking Burke, who served as state commerce secretary during part of Doyle's tenure, for not having proposed a jobs plan. Among other things, the party said Doyle-Burke policies led to the loss of 133,000 jobs, a claim previously made by Walker that we rated Mostly False. Walker had said Burke ""implemented the policies"" of Doyle and those policies ""saw the state lose more than 133,000 jobs."" The number was right but other factors, namely the Great Recession, were primarily to blame. Another line in the state GOP's news release also referenced Burke, albeit more benignly, in making this claim: ""The only time over the last 25 years when the state’s unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. average was when Burke was commerce secretary."" Let’s take a look. The numbers Asked for evidence to back its claim, the Republican Party referred us to monthly unemployment rates for Wisconsin and the U.S. from 1988 through 2013. They are from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government's official job counter. More specifically, the party cited 15 months in 2006 and 2007 when Wisconsin’s unemployment rate exceeded the national rate. That was in May, June, September, October, November and December of 2006; and the first nine months of 2007. Burke was commerce secretary during all 15 months, having served in the post from Feb. 7, 2005 to Nov. 2, 2007. And BLS statistics confirmed that the only times since 1988 that the Wisconsin unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. rate were those 15 months. It's worth noting that although state unemployment rates exceeded U.S. rates during that period, the rates were under 5 percent whereas they are now above 6 percent. And the difference between the Wisconsin and U.S. unemployment rates was relatively small in the period cited by the GOP. For example, in May 2006, the state unemployment rate was 4.7 percent and the national rate was 4.6 percent. The largest difference was 0.4 percent -- the state rate was 4.8 percent in May 2007, while the national rate was 4.4 percent. The Republican Party did not have evidence to back the other part of its claim, which links the higher state unemployment rates to Burke. Other factors Marquette University economist Abdur Chowdhury told us that state government policies, such as providing business incentives, can affect unemployment and that Burke clearly was part of the team that developed policies in the Doyle administration. But many factors, particularly trends in the national economy, affect unemployment rates in the states. ""I wouldn't give Mary Burke full credit for any job that was created and she should not be solely blamed for the loss of any job,"" Chowdhury said. Indeed, when Burke cited her work as commerce secretary and said in October 2013 that when she left the job in 2007, Wisconsin had 84,000 more jobs than it does today, we rated her statement Half True. The numerical part was on target, but Burke overstated the credit that she and Doyle deserved. In this case, the state GOP notes higher unemployment rates while Burke was in the commerce job, but doesn’t directly blame her or her policies for the higher rates. Our rating The Wisconsin GOP said: ""The only time over the last 25 years when the state’s unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. average"" was when Burke was state commerce secretary. The statistic is accurate and the claim only indirectly blames Burke. We rate it Mostly True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.

NRCC says Obamacare cuts money from Medicare and seniors
","Since the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans and their allies have claimed the Affordable Care Act slashes funding for Medicare, the federal healthcare program for seniors. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made almost identical claims in the 2012 presidential election as well. It appears the GOP playbook for the 2014 midterms will be similar. An early indication is in Florida’s special election to replace the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., where the National Republican Congressional Committee is airing an ad hammering Democrat Alex Sink’s support of Obamacare. The ad says the law includes a ""$700 billion cut from Medicare for seniors."" We’ve tackled this claim repeatedly throughout the years. There’s some truth to it, but quite a bit of context is missing. Obamacare does not literally cut funding from the Medicare budget, but tries to bring down future health care costs in the program. Much of this is accomplished by reducing Medicare Advantage, a small subset of Medicare plans that are run by private insurers. President George W. Bush started Medicare Advantage in hopes the increased competition would reduce costs. But those plans are actually costlier than traditional Medicare. So the health care law reduces payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. The goal is get health care providers to increase their efficiency and quality of care instead of cutting benefits for seniors. The overall trend in Medicare spending is still expected to increase, even after the adjustments in the Affordable Care Act. How much are the spending reductions? That has changed throughout the years as estimates get updated. In 2011, the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan scorekeeper of fiscal legislation, estimated that the reductions in Medicare spending in the Affordable Care Act we about $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. A more recent estimate from 2013 anticipated about $716 billion in Medicare savings from 2013-2022. It’s also worth noting that the preferred plan of Republicans in 2012, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget, assumed the same cuts to Medicare. When asked to back up their claim, the NRCC pointed us to our own story from Nov. 2, 2012, about Young’s last Congressional race. In it, we fact-checked an ad in which Young claimed he ""opposed $716 billion cut to Medicare."" We gave it a Half True. Our ruling In its ad against Sink, the NRCC said the Affordable Care Act includes a ""$700 billion cut from Medicare for seniors."" There is reduction in spending to Medicare outlays, but it’s fueled by finding savings in the program, a move that Republicans actually supported in the Ryan budget. Medicare spending still increases in the coming years.

NRCC says Congressional Budget Office predicts Obamacare will cost economy 2.5 million jobs
 ","Here’s a claim we expect to hear often from Republicans in the 2014 midterm races: Obamacare is a jobs killer. The National Republican Congressional Committee gave us a sneak peek at how the attack will be framed with a new ad critical of Alex Sink, the Democrat vying for the former seat of U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., in a special election. ""Nonpartisan government analysts say Obamacare will cost our economy up to 2.5 million jobs,"" the ad says. ""Yet Alex Sink still supports it."" It’s amazing how quickly an economic report can turn into an attack ad. The claims stems from new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan fiscal scorekeeper, that came out just last week. We’ve already rated similar statements a couple of times already. We said they’re Mostly False. Here’s the problem with the ad’s claim: The CBO estimated that by 2017, there would be the equivalent of about 2 million fewer workers than there would be in the absence of the law. The CBO said that number would grow to about 2.5 million by 2024. The ad misinterprets the difference between ""workers"" and ""jobs."" And the word ""costs"" makes it seem like these are positions that employers are eliminating as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Instead, the CBO report says that with Obamacare in place providing greater access to insurance on the individual market and subsidies to help pay for it, some Americans will decide on their own to work less. The CBO estimated that Obamacare would ""reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor — given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive."" This would equal a ""decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024,"" the report continued. ""By providing subsidies that decline with rising income and by making some people financially better off, the ACA will create an incentive for some people to work less,"" the report said. An important distinction in the report is that labor force will reduce by the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time workers over the next decade. That doesn’t mean 2.5 million people will leave their jobs. Some people will only cut back a few hours or leave a second part-time job while others may stop working entirely. This would not increase unemployment. Instead, it may actually create new opportunities for those who have been looking for work. It could also invite people who have given up on looking for work (who aren’t counted in unemployment statistics) back into the labor market, the report said. That doesn’t mean the outlook is entirely rosy. As more people choose to work less, the labor force participation rate should decline, putting a larger burden for supporting the social safety net on those who remain working. Any change in labor force participation comes on top of an already major shift toward retirement driven by the aging of the baby boom. Also, some commentators have expressed concern about having people work less because taxpayer-subsidized insurance is available. Ultimately, it boils down to a tradeoff, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. ""Admittedly there are some touchy issues with the government potentially paying or subsidizing the health care costs for people who could work but choose not to,"" Sinclair told PolitiFact last week. ""In a macroeconomic sense, this still means fewer people working, even if that is their choice,"" she said. ""It also probably means relatively higher wages and better bargaining power for those who are looking for a job. This is very different than the short-run effects of employers cutting positions, where we would see unemployment rates go up, less bargaining power for workers, and potentially relatively lower wages. So, the description of the source of the cut -- whether it’s from supply or demand -- does matter, but not for the count of ‘jobs.’"" In an email to PolitiFact, the NRCC pointed to stories about the new CBO numbers on Obamacare. But those stories distinguished that this was a decrease in workers, not jobs cut by employers, and that’s important. Our ruling The NRCC said ""nonpartisan government analysts say Obamacare will cost our economy up to 2.5 million jobs."" It’s misleading to suggeset the report indicated cuts in jobs. Instead, workers who can now receive subsidized insurance will cut back on hours equivalent to about 2.5 million workers by 2024. The distinction is critical to understanding the law’s impact on the labor market. We rate this statement Mostly False. Correction: Though our ruling statement accurately quoted the ad as saying, ""Nonpartisan government analysts say Obamacare will cost our economy up to 2.5 million jobs,"" a later line in our story inaccurately quoted the ad as saying ""cuts"" instead of ""costs."" That line has since been corrected. The ruling remains the same.",/factchecks/2014/feb/14/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-congressional-budget-office-predicts-oba/

BP letter to MMS urges reduced regulation
","The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig continued to spew oil into the Gulf of Mexico as Lamar McKay, chairman and president of BP America, appeared on ABC News' This Week to answer questions.McKay said BP was doing everything it could to plug the well and mitigate the impact of the oil slick as it moved toward land. He also said he believed equipment failure was the likely cause of the explosion and subsequent spill. This Week host Jake Tapper asked McKay about BP's safety record and its response to the Minerals Management Service's recent efforts to increase regulations on oil rigs.""Just a few months ago, a BP executive protested proposed new safety regulations for oil rigs, writing to the government that quote, 'while BP is supportive of companies having a system in place to reduce risks, accidents, injuries and spills, we are not supportive of extensive proscriptive regulations.' Will BP continue to fight and lobby against safety regulations?"" Tapper asked.""Well, I would characterize the letter you're talking about slightly differently,"" McKay said. ""That letter was in response to the government's request for input on safety regulations that the MMS was looking at. The rest of the letter actually recommends improvements and specific recommendations around safety regulations should they choose to change them. So we're not fighting anything about safety. Safety is the number one priority. We're going to figure out what happened here, and that is going to help the MMS and help ourselves and help the industry get safer, so we're not fighting anything about safety.""We wanted to fact-check McKay's description that ""the rest of the letter actually recommends improvements and specific recommendations around safety regulations should they choose to change them.""On June 17, 2009, the Minerals Management Service proposed rules to require oil and gas operators to develop and implement ""safety and environmental management systems"" for offshore drilling. In essence, the new regulations would require oil companies to create more documentation about their safety procedures and share them with workers and inspectors. The agency said it had reviewed the incident reports for offshore accidents and determined that four areas contributed the most to accidents: • Hazards Analysis, which means minimizing ""the consequences of uncontrolled releases of oil and gas and other safety or environmental incidents""; • Management of Change, which means documenting and analyzing new procedures such as the addition of new equipment or modifications to existing equipment; • Operating Procedures, requiring written safety procedures; • Mechanical Integrity, to ensure that equipment is ""designed, fabricated, installed, tested, inspected, monitored, and maintained in a manner consistent with appropriate service requirements, manufacturer's recommendations, and industry standards."" BP responded to the proposed regulations in a letter dated Sept. 14, 2009, the day before the commenting period closed. The company said the new rules were unnecessary because ""the industry's current safety and environmental statistics demonstrate that the voluntary programs ... have been and continue to be very successful."" McKay is right that after BP gives its opinion that the new rules aren't needed, it then offered a number of changes to proposed rules. But on This Week, McKay gave the impression that BP was seeking additional, safer regulations. In fact, the letter is a plea for the company to have less regulation. We compared BP's suggestions for changes to the MMS regulations. Some of the suggestions are for language changes or technical fixes. But we found that in many cases, BP was suggesting changes that would give the company fewer responsibilities or more flexibility under the proposed rules. Here are a few examples:On Hazards Analysis, BP suggested language to make it clear that BP doesn't have to develop procedures for third-party companies. It also said it shouldn't have to develop analyses for property damage if the damage doesn't affect worker safety or the environment. For Operating Procedures, BP suggested language so that all employees would not have access to all safety procedures, but only to documentation that specifically apply to their jobs.On Mechanical Integrity, BP objected to language that required equipment to meet manufacturer's recommendations or specifications. A company's own specifications should be sufficient, the letter said. ""Many of our inspection and testing requirements, while meeting regulations, are risk based in approach,"" the letter said. On regular safety audits, BP said that audits should occur based on ""performance and risk rather than a prescribed schedule."" Overall, the ideas in BP's letter point toward limiting the impact of new rules and making them apply to more narrow circumstances. McKay told Tapper that, ""The rest of the letter actually recommends improvements and specific recommendations around safety regulations should they choose to change them."" This gives the impression that BP was trying to work with regulators to make the safety regulations better, to make conditions safer. But most of what the letter suggests are ways to make the regulations less of a burden for BP. Certainly this is an ""improvement"" from BP's perspective, but we don't see how it makes safety ""the number one priority."" So we rate his statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/may/02/lamar-mckay/bp-letter-mms-urges-reduced-regulation/

Bill Maher and George Will spar over oil and Brazil. We play the ref.
","A potential ecological disaster in the Gulf of Mexico led to a spirited debate on U.S. energy policy on ABC News' This Week.

Liberal commentator Bill Maher lamented the fact that both major political parties, including President Barack Obama, have supported offshore oil drilling in recent years instead of being more aggressive about renewable energy.

""Where is the other side on this? I could certainly criticize oil companies and I could criticize America in general for not attacking this problem in the '70s. Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years; we certainly could have,"" Maher said.

Maher said Obama seems to be backpedaling on offshore drilling since the spill, adding ""I hope there's a flip-flop I can believe in there.""

Conservative columnist George Will challenged Maher about Brazil. ""Could you just explain to me in what sense has Brazil got off oil?""

""I believe they did,"" Maher said. ""I believe in the 70's they had a program to use sugarcane ethanol, and I believe that is what fuels their country.""

""I think they still burn a lot of oil and have a lot of offshore (drilling),"" Will said.

""Can we have judges factcheck this on Brazil?"" Maher said a few moments later. ""I don't think I dreamed that on Brazil.""

With an invitation like that, how could we resist? So we dug into the research on Brazil and energy.

Brazil does produce a lot of sugarcane ethanol, as Maher said.

""Brazil is one of the largest producers of ethanol in the world and is the largest exporter of the fuel,"" according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, an independent agency within the U.S. Department of Energy that collects and analyzes energy information.

Additionally,  more than half of all cars in Brazil are flexible-fuel capable, which means they can run on 100 percent ethanol or an ethanol-gasoline mixture.

By contrast, the best numbers we found for the United States is that there are approximately 8 million flexible-fuel vehicles, which would translate to roughly 3 percent of all vehicles. (We would caution that even that number might be deceptive, as the U.S. Department of Energy warns that ""many FFV owners don't know their vehicle is one."")

But even though Brazil aggressively uses biofuels, and invests quite a bit in hydroelectric power, it still produces and consumes a lot of oil.

In 2008, Brazil ranked No. 7 on the list of the world's countries that consume the most oil, using about 2.5 million barrels per day. In first place was the United States at 19.5 million barrels per day, followed by China, Japan, India, Russia, and Germany, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Brazil also produces a lot of oil through drilling near its coasts. In recent years, Brazil's state-controlled energy company Petrobras announced a major new find of oil in some of the deepest waters where exploration is conducted, some 7,000 feet below in the Atlantic Ocean. The find is expected to make Brazil even more important in the oil export business. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that Brazil will become a net exporter of oil this year, even before the new fields are tapped.

Getting back to our factcheck, Maher was likely remembering Brazil's aggresive efforts to promote ethanol, and certainly Brazil has outpaced the United States in getting flexible fuel vehicles on the road. But Maher said, ""Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years."" Actually, Brazil still consumes a great deal of oil. It's also embarking on more offshore drilling in some of the deepest waters for exploration. Brazil is hardly ""off oil."" So we rate Maher's statement False.",/factchecks/2010/may/02/bill-maher/bill-maher-and-george-will-spar-over-oil-and-brazi/

Rick Perry, a critic of the new federal health care law, said in an April 15 interview with the Texas Tribune and Newsweek magazine that states could act on their own to reduce the number of residents who lack health insurance.How so?Texas has “had for over two years, waiver requests in front of the Health and Human Services committee — before this administration (of Democratic President Barack Obama) got into place, I might add — that allowed us some flexibility ... to use dollars differently than what are mandated by the federal government to create insurance opportunities for those that are uninsured today,” Perry said.Perry's point: Texas has proposed some good ideas to help its uninsured residents with health care, but the feds have chosen to sit on them.Really? We sought to learn more.In response to our inquiry, the governor’s re-election campaign provided us with a copy of a 65-page proposal to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services dated April 18, 2008 -- nearly two years to the day before Perry’s Tribune interview. Clarification: According to the campaign, only one waiver request was sent, not ""requests"" as Perry put it.The Texas proposal states that it “outlines a comprehensive package of health care reforms that will provide more people with insurance, reduce reliance on expensive emergency room visits for basic care, and make it easier for the working poor to buy into employer-sponsored health coverage.” The state would do this, according to the proposal, by creating the Texas Health Opportunity Pool, a fund that would, among other things, provide subsidies to help low-income Texans pay for employer-sponsored insurance or buy into private plans the state would help set up. State officials estimated that by its fifth year, the program would have nearly 700,000 participants and would have cost $30 billion in federal, state and local funds.  To generate money for the pool, the state sought permission from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to use federal Medicaid dollars that would normally go to hospitals that serve many uninsured and poor patients. (The federal agency can give states some flexibility in how they operate their Medicaid programs.) Medicaid, established in 1965, uses federal and state funding to provide health insurance to extremely low-income Americans.  Perry had previously touted the plan in his 2007 State of the State address, saying that it ""recognizes the long-term benefits of providing Texans preventative care through insurance instead of paying for costly emergency room visits."" At the time, more than 5 million Texans lacked health insurance.However, Perry's vision for a revamped health care system in Texas -- the state that has had the highest proportion of uninsured residents for years -- hasn't gotten very far since it was sent to Washington in April 2008, George W. Bush's last year as president. In August 2008, Dianne Heffron, an official with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of the federal health agency, sent a letter to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission stating that CMS was ""willing to work with Texas as part of a formal (waiver) process"" but that ""a number of areas under this proposal have been identified as problematic"" -- making it impossible for the agency to approve the proposal as written.Some cited issues:+ A delay -- two years -- before insurance subsidies to parents and adults without children would take effect. + A $25,000 cap on insurance benefits for parents, which the agency indicated was too low.+ Extending health coverage to children of legal immigrants who have lived in the country for less than five years; a 1996 rewrite of federal welfare law bars immigrants who have been in the country less than five years from receiving public benefits.After receiving the letter, according to Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, the state went back and forth with federal officials as it unsuccessfully tried to get the waiver approved before Bush left office.On July 31, 2009, Perry wrote to the Obama administration's secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, asking her to approve the request as previously submitted by the state. His letter states that the ""negotiation process was under way when the Obama administration took office in January, but is now stalled in Washington.""Sebelius replied Oct. 27, writing that federal officials still had concerns about the proposal, including ""the proposed funding sources and the extent to which access to health care coverage would be meaningfully expanded."" She said she had directed appropriate officials to meet with the state to ""help determine next steps and further assist Texas in developing an approvable health reform proposal."" On Nov. 1, the state sent Sebelius a two-page document outlining the ""principles, values and outcomes contained in the Texas waiver"" to ""re-familiarize"" the feds with the proposal in hopes of extending discussions. When CMS asked for more information, Goodman told us, the state held back, waiting for the outcome of congressional debate over health care.By then, the prospect of national health reform appeared likely to complicate the Texas waiver request. In fact, the new law extended Medicaid coverage to some of the same people Texas had targeted to receive insurance subsidies.""We don’t believe the current (federal) reform plan invalidates our waiver request, but the implementation of the federal reforms would significantly change the landscape so we’d probably have to make some adjustments in our state proposal,"" Goodman said.Nevertheless, Goodman said, the state has continued to push for the ""primary components"" of the proposal, including redirecting billions in Medicaid hospital funds to the Health Opportunity Pool, but has received no recent response from CMS officials about that.When we contacted CMS, spokeswoman Mary Kahn said the agency was waiting for Texas to revise and resubmit its proposal. ""They haven't sent us anything that meets the full requirements of being a formal waiver request,"" Kahn said. ""In other words, the ball is in the state's court.""So, where does all this leave Perry's statement?The governor is correct that the state sought federal permission about two years ago to redirect Medicaid hospital funds into a state pool intended to help some low-income Texans get private insurance. Since then, state and federal officials have gone back and forth on the request, with no resolution.Perry portrays the request as still awaiting action by the feds. But the federal agency has told state officials that their proposal needs revision before it can be formally considered. In that sense, federal officials have acted, and the state is responsible for the latest delay that Perry decries.We rate Perry's statement as False.",/factchecks/2010/may/01/rick-perry/perry-says-state-waiting-feds-act-health-care-prop/

Rush Limbaugh says Alaska's Prince William Sound is now pristine
","With 200,000 gallons of oil a day spewing from an exploded oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, forming a slick the size of West Virginia and threatening the coastline of Louisiana, radio pundit Rush Limbaugh said there's no need to panic, that ""the ocean will take care of this on its own if it was left alone and was left out there. It's natural."" And to prove his point, Limbaugh pointed to the restoration of Alaska's Prince William Sound, which was devastated by an oil spill from the Exxon Valdez 21 years ago. ""They were wiping off the rocks with Dawn dishwater detergent and paper towels and so forth,"" Limbaugh said on his April 29, 2010, radio show. ""The place is pristine now."" Government officials involved in the cleanup say the conditions are long way from being pristine, which is defined as ""completely free from dirt or contamination."" Despite the beautiful scenery and wildlife in full view in Prince William Sound, a report from the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council released last year on the 20th anniversary of the spill stated, ""one of the most stunning revelations of Trustee Council-funded monitoring over the last 10 years is that Exxon Valdez oil persists in the environment and in places, is nearly as toxic as it was the first few weeks after the spill."" The Trustee Council, formed by the Alaska government to oversee the restoration of the injured ecosystem, concluded the oil is decreasing at a rate of 0 to 4 percent a year, and ""at this rate, the remaining oil will take decades and possibly centuries to disappear entirely."" We asked Craig Tillery, deputy attorney general for the state of Alaska, about Limbaugh's comment. Tillery, a who has served as counsel to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, said it depends on how you define pristine. ""The vast majority of oil that landed in Alaska is gone,"" he said. But the government dug hundreds of test holes and found pockets of ""still fresh-looking oil that is still toxic to the marine environment."" In all, they estimated 23,000 gallons (of the 11 million gallons spilled by the Exxon Valdez) remains in isolated pockets of some beaches. ""It's buried, you wouldn't see it,"" said Tillery. ""It looks pristine, but it's not pristine if your definition is that there's no oil left."" And that oil is still getting into the environment, he said. Sea ducks and sea otters are still exhibiting signs of exposure to oil, he said. And animals such as sea otters, which dig for clams, have released some of the oil trapped under the ground. Most of the wildlife has recovered from the spill, Tillery said, but you also need to consider what you don't see. ""You don't see as many killer whales as you did before the spill,"" he said. ""You don't see herrings in the numbers you did before the spill. On the surface, you'd probably say this looks pretty pristine. Underlying that, though, there is still evidence of the spill."" ""There are beaches where you can turn a shovel and still find oil,"" said Stan Jones, director of external affairs for the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council. Prince William sound has ""mostly recovered visually,"" Jones said, but to call it pristine is an ""overstatement."" Dr. Jeffrey Short, who was the leading chemist for the governments of Alaska and the United States following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, led a series of studies on the unexpected persistence of the oil. In a Q & A with the environmental group Oceana, with whom he is now employed, Short stated, ""We found that it (oil) lasted a lot longer than we thought in some locations and it was much better preserved than we thought it would be. In some places the oil hadn't degraded much beyond the first couple months after it had spilled."" We asked Short about Limbaugh's comment and he said that while it's fair to say most of Prince William Sound has recovered from the impact of the Exxon Valdez, ""there are some places where the oil continues to linger."" In fact, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council has a link on its website to its ""Report on Recent Lingering Oil Studies."" ""At the time of the spill, most scientists believed that, within a few years, the process of weathering would either break down and decompose the oil, or would cause it to turn into a form of asphalt that would have little potential to release toxic components into the environment,"" the report states. ""Contrary to these expectations, oil persists at some sites in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska in a relatively unweathered and potentially toxic condition."" ""Organisms that use the intertidal were severely affected by the spill and continued to show adverse effects from exposure to oil for many years after the spill. These effects manifested themselves in reduced survival rates and diminished populations. In recent years, however, there is evidence of improvement. The extent of oil exposure appears to be diminishing in most species, and there is evidence that the populations of some species are beginning to increase."" That sounds encouraging. But it doesn't change the fact that, despite outward appearance, 21 years after the Exxon Valdez spill, Prince William Sound is not pristine. You may not be able to see it, but scientists and anyone willing to turn over rocks with a shovel attest to the fact that thousands of gallons of oil remain buried in some beaches, and the oil continues to adversely affect the environment.

"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Allen West']","
West wrong to claim Klein didn't hold 'single' town hall
","Allen West, a Republican who is running for the South Florida congressional seat held by Democratic Rep. Ron Klein, accuses the incumbent of ducking the public during the debate about health care reform.

In a press release March 21, 2010, West said:

""Klein did not hold a single town hall meeting where the general public was invited to ask questions or present their views. Klein hid behind controlled environments such as telephone conference calls and tightly controlled meetings. He refused my offer to debate him on this topic at a place and time of his choosing.""

For this item, we are focusing on whether West is right that Klein did not hold a ""single'' town hall meeting open to the public.

Last summer, town hall meetings about health care across the country drew angry protesters who turned the usually calm meetings into shouting matches. In August, a monthly public meeting run by Klein's staff at a library in Broward County that typically draws few constituents drew more than 100 in an event orchestrated by Klein's Republican rival West, the Miami Herald wrote. Protesters called Klein a ""coward"" and a ""communist'' and waved signs with statements including ""Obama Care is a big lie.'' Klein did not attend that meeting.

There is no dispute that when the health care debate hit a fever pitch last August, Klein chose to hold an Aug. 26 town hall meeting by telephone rather than in person. Klein told the Miami Herald that he disagreed with a suggestion that he was trying to avoid meeting with residents in person and argued that he could reach more people through ""tele-town halls.""

""I will compare my record on town hall meetings with anyone in the Congress,"" Klein said in an Aug. 6 article. ""I've always been very out there and willing to meet with people, and we're going to continue to do that.""

More than 300 people got in touch with Klein's office asking to participate and automated calls went out to numbers in Klein's district which attracted more than 6,000 to the call, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel wrote in the Broward Politics blog Aug. 26, 2009. Klein gave a nine-minute introduction and answered more than 15 questions during the next hour.

We asked West's campaign for proof that Klein did not hold a single public in-person town hall on health care. But they presented none.

""We stand by our comment, he has never held a single town hall meeting,'' said Josh Grodin, West campaign spokesperson. ""I believe that is going to be in the public domain.""

So we took that as a challenge and turned to the public domain and searched Nexis and Google for any examples of Klein holding an in-person town hall meeting on health care. We didn't count news reports after the fact that simply quoted Klein's office as saying they held a public town hall meeting. For example, we didn't count a Naked Politics blog post Aug. 13, 2009 in which Klein's office publicized a meeting they had the day before with 100 residents of the Abbey Delray South retirement community because that event only drew condo residents and congressional staff. And we didn't count brief mentions on websites of organizations -- for example, the Temple Beth El newsletter saying Klein was going to speak at a Brotherhood brunch about health care. Those didn't seem to be the public town halls that West was talking about.

But we did find one item from the Sun Sentinel Boca Raton Forum blog headlined ""Klein to talk about health care and veterans' issues this week.""

It was posted June 29, 2009, and said, ""Congressman Ron Klein will be in Boca Raton this week discussing health care and veterans' issues. Klein will host a health care town hall from 2 to 3:30 p.m. June 29 at the Boca Raton Community Hospital’s Dawson Theater, 800 Meadows Road, and his staff will assist constituents with health care casework."" That's not a lot of notice, but it shows Klein had notified the news media -- and the public -- about the meeting.

That one alone disproves West's claim, but we wondered if there were others.

Klein's office sent us a list of events where Klein spoke to the public about health care. We then asked Klein's office for evidence that his office announced the meetings in advance. Klein's spokeswoman Melissa Silverman sent back a few media advisories that outlined Klein's upcoming schedule at various events, including for events about health care. We found two additional examples that advertised public meetings on health care:

* An advisory dated April 6, 2009 included a 2 p.m. April 7 event: ""Listening Tour on Health Care, Bethesda Memorial Hospital, Clayton Conference Center, 2815 South Seacrest Blvd, Boynton Beach.""

* An advisory dated Oct. 23, 2009 included a 9:30 a.m. Oct. 26 event: "" Health Care Listening Tour – Memorial Hospital, 3501 Johnson Street, Hollywood.

Klein's office also sent us copies of e-mail messages sent to constituents and community leaders about the listening events in Boynton Beach and Boca Raton. ""A town hall, hearing from you on the future of health care,'' they say.

We sent the one item we found, and the additional two that Klein's staff pointed out, to West's campaign and asked for a response.

""We stand by our comment that he has never held a single town hall meeting open to the general public,'' Grodin wrote in an email. ""If Klein is advertising his town hall meetings in blogs that are likely never going to be read by a vast majority of his constituents, it clearly indicates a lack of openness that he and his boss, Nancy Pelosi, promised when they took over Congressional Leadership. Furthermore, the fact that (PolitiFact staffer) Amy Sherman has had to do such extensive research to find 'proof' of 'Town Hall' meetings goes to show just how difficult it must have been for the general public to find out such information. Town Hall meetings should be widely advertised to citizens, not email blasted to members of the media.""

We don't agree with the West campaign's interpretation. Indeed, the reason that congressional offices ""blast"" e-mails to the media about these events is to advertise them widely.

And to West's claim, we find Klein provided notice and held at least three public events on health care. We find West's claim to be False.",/factchecks/2010/apr/30/allen-west/west-wrong-claim-klein-didnt-hold-single-town-hall/

U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek says Charlie Crist flipped twice on offshore drilling position
","Many Republicans believe that Charlie Crist's decision to run for the U.S. Senate as an independent, no-party candidate, helps the Democrats chances in November.But it also means Democrats may have to outmaneuver Crist for some traditional Democratic voters.Leading Democrat U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek started to lay that groundwork within hours of Crist's announcement on April 29, 2010. In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Meek said Crist's position against offshore oil drilling has vacillated over the years, while Meek's position has never changed.""I've been consistent as relates to being against offshore drilling in Florida,"" Meek said. ""I can't say that (for) every candidate in the race. It was (a) news flash as of two days ago that the governor switched his position once again on offshore oil drilling.""Oil drilling is certainly a timely topic. On March 30, President Barack Obama proposed to open vast expanses of water along the Atlantic coastline, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the north coast of Alaska to oil and natural gas drilling. Three weeks later, on April 20, an explosion and fire on a drilling rig resulted in a massive oil spill that threatened several Gulf Coast states. The spill has forced many to rethink the benefits of offshore drilling -- including Crist.The key to Meek's claim is how often, and how much, Crist has changed his position.As a candidate for governor in 2006, Crist was unequivocal that he would never support oil drilling off Florida's shores. Crist even evoked childhood memories of cleaning birds after an oil spill in Tampa Bay, the St. Petersburg Times' Steve Bousquet reported. Crist expressed opposition to drilling throughout his career, from state senator to education commissioner to U.S. Senate candidate to attorney general. A sampling: But in 2008, with gasoline prices hovering near $4 a gallon and Crist being mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate for a ticket that would popularize the phrase ""drill, baby, drill!"", Crist backed off his previous unflinching opposition. On June 18, 2008, Crist said: ""We have to be sympathetic to the pocketbooks of Floridians and what they're paying at the pump for gas and balance that with any way that our state might be able to contribute in terms of resources to have a greater supply and therefore lower prices,"" Crist said. ""I think an open-minded person understands that we ought to at least study (offshore drilling)."" The next week Crist delivered a keynote address at a global climate change summit in Miami. ""We must have an open discussion – without compromising Florida’s sensitive ecosystems and natural beauty,"" Crist said of offshore drilling. ""As I stated last week, only when we are able to do so far enough from Florida’s coast, safe enough for our people and clean enough for our beaches, should we consider increasing our oil supply by drilling off Florida’s shores. Let me repeat that – far enough, safe enough and clean enough.""Crist said options now needed to be studied, but largely stayed away from offering specific proposals.That so-called study period ended with the April 20, 2010 spill.After flying over the gulf and seeing the spill firsthand, Crist withdrew his support for any form of drilling off Florida's coasts.""It could be devastating to Florida if something like that were to occur,"" Crist said. ""It's the last thing in the world I would want to see happen in our beautiful state. Crist also repeated the criteria laid out in his 2008 climate change address, saying the gulf spill proved drilling isn't yet far enough away, clean enough, or safe enough.""Clearly that one isn't far enough and that's about 50 to 60 miles out, it's clearly not clean enough after we saw what we saw today - that's horrific - and it certainly isn't safe enough. It's the opposite of safe,"" Crist said.We should note that Meek has largely opposed increased offshore drilling. Meek was one of 100 U.S. House members in 2003 to sign a letter urging Congressional leaders not to open Florida's coastline to offshore drilling. He signed a similar letter in 2005, and in 2006, voted against a proposal to allow oil and gas exploration within 50 to 100 miles of most coastlines, and within 234 miles of Tampa Bay. He did, however, release a tepid endorsement/criticism (it's hard to tell) of Obama's March 2010 drilling proposal. Read it here.Now back to Meek's claim against Crist. Meek said Crist's positions has changed ""once again"" on offshore drilling. That means at least twice.On a very basic level, Crist was opposed to oil drilling until 2008, then open to it, and now opposed again. That's two changes of positions as Meek suggests. But a more nuanced reading of Crist's statements on offshore drilling produces a slightly different interpretation. Crist was first opposed to oil drilling, then open to it if was proven safe. The April 20, 2010 spill convinced him it wasn't, and as a result, Crist again became opposed.We don't think that's necessarily the same as two flip flops. Crist decided to to explore the possibility of offshore drilling in 2008 after years of rejecting it out of hand (flip 1), but ended that examination after seeing the devastation in the Gulf of Mexico after the April 20 spill. That might be one and a half, but that's not a second flip.As a result, we rate Meek's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/apr/30/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-charlie-crist-offshore-oil/

Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson says wind leases have earned nearly $500,000 despite delayed electricity production
","Jerry Patterson, the state land commissioner seeking re-election this year, champions the prospect of gathering electricity from ocean winds in a recent column in the Austin American-Statesman even though no wind turbines have been built in the Gulf of Mexico. “Regardless of any delays,” Patterson says in the column published Tuesday, “the Land Office has earned the school children of Texas $451,932.89 on wind leases that haven’t produced a watt of energy.” Half a mil for school kids without producing electricity? We wondered if Patterson was sparking on extra cylinders. Responding, Patterson said that since the state started leasing the rights to erect wind turbines in about 163,000 acres of Gulf waters in 2005, two companies have paid in the cited money in bonus royalties and delay rentals even though no wind turbines have been built. Land office spokesman Jim Suydam said the total, paid to the state since January 2005, also reflects nomination fees, application fees and interest earned on the collected money. Suydam said nomination fees are what someone pays to nominate a tract of state land for an energy lease. The state then puts the tract up for bid, with the high bidder winning the lease. Rental or bonus payments are the amount someone pays (as determined by their lease with the state) to lease the tract of land for a period of time. Application fees are what they pay to apply for the lease. The agency shared a breakdown showing $44,117 of the total Patterson touts came from leaseholders of acreage on land where turbines have not yet been built. That makes the total income from Gulf leases $407,815. We nudged Patterson about saying he ""earned the school children of Texas money” -- does he mean kids are getting checks from the state? “Of course not,” Patterson said. “I don’t think anybody would believe I meant the school children get a check.” (Indeed, land commissioners traditionally mention the ""schoolchildren of Texas"" in connection with proceeds from state-owned lands; it's hallowed parlance.) Patterson said the described proceeds—like mineral royalties from state lands—went instead to the Permanent School Fund, the state's public education endowment, which had a $22.6 billion balance as of the end of August. The State Board of Education receives a share of earnings from the fund for distribution to school districts on a per-student basis. Also, districts use the fund to back bonds for capital projects, according to the endowment's 2009 annual report.

No congressional pay cuts since the Great Depression, Democratic lawmaker says
","Given widespread voter frustration with Congress and stagnation in private-sector pay, it's no surprise that Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Ariz., has introduced a bill to cut the pay for members of Congress by 5 percent. Kirkpatrick touted her bill in a House floor speech on April 28, 2010, saying that it was time for lawmakers to face a pay cut. ""When millions of Americans are tightening their belts,"" she said, ""folks have the right to expect their elected officials to do the same. ... Members have not reduced their salaries for 77 years, since the Great Depression. I do not know anyone back in Arizona who has gone eight decades without a pay cut. Senators and representatives should be no different."" We thought it would be worth checking her comment that lawmakers ""have not reduced their salaries"" since 1933, which she says resulted in ""eight decades without a pay cut."" Kirkpatrick chose her year wisely: In the midst of the Great Depression, Congress voted to reduce its salaries twice. In 1932, lawmakers cut their pay from $10,000 to $9,000. A year later, they cut salaries from $9,000 to $8,500. Kirkpatrick is correct that since 1933, congressional salary rates have only climbed upward. Today, salaries for representatives and senators are $174,000 a year. (Click here for a table of congressional salaries from 1789 to today.) Case closed? Not so fast. The situation changes when you account for inflation. We used the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator to determine the inflation-adjusted salaries at some of the key points for Congress during the past 77 years. Overall, the number has indeed gone up from the adjusted 1933 rate of $142,297 (in 2010 dollars) to $174,000 per year today. But we found that there have been periods when lawmakers' pay was stagnant, and once inflation is factored in, that means they effectively took pay cuts. For instance, just before salaries were raised in 1965, the congressional pay rate that had been in force since 1955 -- $22,500 -- had shrunk in value to $19,452, a 14 percent decline in purchasing power. And just before salaries were raised in 1975, the congressional pay rate that had been in force since 1969 -- $42,500 -- had shriveled in value to $31,638 in 1969 dollars, a whopping 26 percent decline in purchasing power. ""There were a number of years since 1969 in which Congress specifically voted to hold its nominal salary unchanged even though price levels were rising and an automatic pay formula would have bumped up its pay, along with the pay of other senior officers of the U.S. government,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the liberal Brookings Institution who has testified before a House committee on lawmakers' salaries.  There's also evidence that, once inflation is factored in, lawmakers are less well-compensated today than they once were. In 1955, lawmakers were paid the equivalent of $182,713 in 2010 dollars, an amount 5 percent higher than today's actual level. In 1965, they were paid the 2010 equivalent of $207,267, or 19 percent higher than today's actual level. Factoring inflation into the equation doesn't disprove Kirkpatrick's statement that members of Congress ""have not reduced their salaries for 77 years."" But it does make it hard for her to argue that lawmakers have gone ""eight decades without a pay cut."" In reality, congressional salaries have zig-zagged quite a bit over the years, sometimes exceeding today's level of purchasing power and sometimes falling short. We're not shedding tears for the buying power of people who earn more than $170,000 a year. But the erratic way that Congress has raised its salaries means that the story is more complicated than Kirkpatrick portrays it.

Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison says Democrats passed health care plan despite overwhelming public opposition
","
U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, speaking for Republicans in response to President Barack Obama’s weekly radio address on Saturday, spiced a call for keeping watch over the nation’s financial sector with a ‘plaint about Democrats’ stewardship of recently adopted health care legislation. 
""Americans are troubled,"" Hutchison said, ""by the way Democrats forced their health care bill on the public that overwhelmingly opposed it."" 
We missed the whips and chains in the health-care fight and wondered if Hutchison imagined things, considering key actions took place by majority votes. That said, we're setting aside this part of her statement as partisan hyperbole. 
For this article, we’re focusing on Hutchison’s claim that the American public ""overwhelmingly opposed"" the health care plan. 
PolitiFact.com previously looked at references to public opinion and the health care legislation. 
In February, it found Mostly True a statement by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, that 75 percent of the American people ""have said either don't do anything (on health care) or start over."" And in March, PolitiFact.com rated as Half True Democratic U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth's statement that polling showed almost 40 percent of Americans opposed the health-care plan because they didn’t think it went far enough. 
Responding to our inquiry, Hutchison spokesman Jeff Sadosky told us that from late April 2009 to late April this year, telephone calls and letters mostly sent by Texans to the senior Texas senator ran heavily against ""Obama’s health care"" approach. More than 18,100 callers were opposed while 4,830 were in favor; about 75 percent of more than 350,000 letters that Hutchison received were against the reform, Sadosky said. 
Still, signals from Texas constituents don't necessarily demonstrate national sentiment. We turned next to polls taken before and after the final congressional action, which was followed in late March by Obama signing the plan into law. 
According to almost every poll we found, more Americans opposed action than favored it as the debate reached its climax. 
According to a Gallup poll taken March 4-7, weeks before the final votes, 48 percent of Americans said they would advise their representative to vote against an Obama health-care reform measure with 45 percent saying they’d advise a favorable vote. At the time, Gallup said the result confirmed ""the generally divided nature of public opinion on health care legislation."" 
Seeking to gauge whether Americans' opposition was overwhelming, as Hutchison puts it, we reviewed summaries of polls compiled by the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation, a reliable font of information on health care. 
From our sampling: A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll taken March 19-21 asked individuals if they generally favored or opposed the health care plan then awaiting final action. The tally: 39 percent in favor, 59 percent against and 2 percent with no opinion. A Bloomberg poll taken those same days found 38 percent of respondents in favor, 50 percent opposed and 12 percent not sure. 
Some other polls showed a narrower approval/disapproval gap. A Quinnipiac University poll taken March 22-23 found 40 percent mostly approving of the health care system changes just passed by Congress, 49 percent mostly disapproving and 11 percent not knowing or answering. 
In a CBS News poll taken March 18-23, 42 percent said they approved of the ""current health care reform"" measure, 46 percent were opposed and 12 percent said they did not know or declined to answer. And a poll taken March 23-26 by The Washington Post found 46 percent of respondents supporting the changes to the health care system just enacted by Congress and Obama with 46 percent opposed. 
A Gallup poll taken in early April showed a near-even break between Americans saying passage of the plan was a bad thing and Americans saying it was good. Forty-nine percent of individuals polled April 8-11 said it was a bad thing with 45 percent saying it was good. 
Generally, Gallup writes, ""over the past year, Americans have been remarkably stable in their assessments of the bill, with neither supporters nor opponents able to generate sustained majority agreement with their position."" 
Doubts remain high in Texas, according to an April 14 telephone poll by Rasmussen Reports. Sixty-seven percent of surveyed likely voters favor a proposal to repeal the health care plan to stop it from taking effect, with 28 percent opposing such a move. 
Where does all this leave Hutchison’s claim of overwhelming opposition at the time lawmakers acted? 
Certainly, many Texans clamored against approval. And national polls show more Americans opposed the action than supported it. 
But Hutchison overreaches by calling that opposition overwhelming.

Charlie Crist's announcement on April 29, 2010 that he'll bolt the Republican Party and run for the U.S. Senate as an independent would have been an unimaginable proposition just a few months ago.After all, Crist was considered a 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate and a potential rising star. Ten months ago, Crist led former House Speaker Marco Rubio by more than 30 percentage points in Senate primary polls.And just one month ago, Crist categorically dismissed the possibility he'd run for the Senate as anything other than a Republican.In a March 28 televised debate on Fox News Sunday, he told moderator Chris Wallace he would run as a Republican in the primary. Here's the exchange:WALLACE: There have been persistent rumors in Florida that you are so far behind, at least currently, in the polls — double digits to Mr. Rubio — that you may run instead as an independent. Here is your chance to dispel all the rumors. Are you willing to pledge right here, right now that you will run in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate and not run as an independent?CRIST: I'm running as a Republican.

Crist faces uphill battle to find votes as an independent
","Marco Rubio, now the presumptive Republican nominee for Florida's open U.S. Senate seat, says Republican -- scratch that -- no-party candidate Gov. Charlie Crist can't win in November.Rubio advisers Todd Harris and Heath Thompson assessed the dynamics of a three-way election between Rubio, Crist and Democrat U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek in an April 28, 2010 campaign memo that was shared with the media.The memo outlines the hurdles facing Crist's no-party candidacy. Harris and Thompson wrote that Crist will have trouble raising money and organizing a ground campaign now that he lacks the support of a major party. Florida's voter registration numbers, Harris and Thompson wrote, are also squarely against ""the people's"" candidate.Harris and Thompson wrote: There are two great myths about Independent voters in Florida 1. There are lots of them.2. They are all politically moderate.Neither of these is true. In reality, by registration fewer than 20 percent of Florida voters are Independents. And that number is even smaller when based on actual turn out percentages. With Crist's announcement on April 29 that he would run with no party affiliation, we wanted to assess if the Rubio campaign's voter statistics.The Florida Division of Elections maintains voter registration statistics for the entire state, and publishes updates on its website. The latest report comes from February 2010.According to that report, Florida currently has slightly more than 11 million registered voters. Of them, 3.97 million are registered as Republicans (36 percent), and 4.62 million are registered as Democrats (42 percent). That leaves 2.47 million people that are registered as a member of a minor political party, or registered to vote with no party affiliation.That math means that 22 percent of voters who are something other than a registered Republican or Democrat. You can see the registration statistics for yourself here. In their memo, Harris and Thompson use a capital ""I"" to describe independent voters, which traditionally means the Independent Party. But we're assuming they actually meant third party or no party voters.The two major Independent parties -- the Independence Party of Florida, and the Independent Party of Florida -- make up 2 to 3 percent of all registered voters. The lion's share or non-Republican or Democrat voters are registered as no party affiliation (19 percent).Harris and Thompson wrote that with Democrats now thinking the Senate race can be competitive, and Rubio consolidating a corps of conservative voters, it will very difficult for Crist to find enough support -- even though his threshold to win in November could be as low as 34 percent of the vote.""Marco and Meek will have the wherewithal to become better known,"" Rubio's advisers wrote. ""Republicans will react to Charlie’s switch. Democrats will be introduced to Meek. And voters from both parties will begin to gravitate back to their respective camps.""Furthermore, Independents really only know one candidate right now,"" they wrote. ""And that’s not going to remain true for very long either.""Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist who ran Barack Obama's winning Florida campaign, said for Crist to win he'll need to get roughly 50 percent of third party and no party voters as well as 30-to-35 percent of the vote in both major parties.""The independent vote in Florida isn't as big as some people think,"" Schale wrote on his blog. Back to the Rubio campaign's claim. His advisers said that ""by registration fewer than 20 percent of Florida voters are Independents.""

Tim James: Report backs up claim that non-English speaking drivers pose safety hazard
","Alabama gubernatorial candidate Tim James' campaign ad calling for state driver's license exams to be given only in English has sparked a political firestorm in an already smoldering immigration debate.

""Why do our politicians make us give driver's license exams in 12 languages?"" James says in the ad. ""This is Alabama. We speak English. If you want to live here, learn it. We're only giving the test in English if I'm governor.""

James has defended his stance, in part, because he says it's a public safety issue.

According to an April 26, 2010, press release on his campaign website, the evidence is a 2004 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report that said work-related traffic fatalities had increased 72 percent. According to James' campaign, the federal agency attributed that to increasing numbers of drivers who could not read or understand warning signs in English. The campaign didn't directly cite the report, but cited an article about it in the Sept. 23, 2004, Birmingham News.

""We welcome non-English speaking people, who are legally in the U.S., to Alabama. However, if you want to drive in our states, public safety concerns dictate that you need to speak English,"" James said in the release. ""Political correctness may endear you to the Rachel Maddow crowd, but here in Alabama, the safety of our people comes first.""

We decided to look into the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report cited by the James campaign. It's a 2003 BLS report on fatal occupational injuries in Alabama. And that year, the report shows, there were 63 transportation-related incidents. But it doesn't say anything about any of those accidents being tied to an inability of drivers to read signs in English. Turns out that's not something the BLS tracks.

So where did James get that? It was from speculation by a Department of Labor economist, Victoria Dinkins, who was quoted in a newspaper story about the report.

""Dinkins said transportation accidents accounted for the bulk of Alabama's 2003 work-related fatalities,"" the Birmingham News story said. ""Fatalities involving truck drivers and workers driving company cars or personal vehicles on the job rose to 62 last year from 36 in 2002.

""The language barrier for Hispanic workers could also play a role in increased Alabama on-the-job fatalities, Dinkins said.

""If these workers can't recognize or interpret a sign that shows that something is dangerous, that will present a problem,"" she said. ""A further problem may exist even if an employer displays a warning sign in Spanish and the workers may speak Spanish, but are not literate in English or Spanish. Therefore they would be unable to read a sign regardless of the language it is written in.""

But that speculation isn't supported by the report. Although it doesn't directly address their language, it tracks the race and ethnic origin of those who died on the job. So if Dinkins' speculation is correct, we would expect a much higher rate among workers of Hispanic origin.

It doesn't. Of the 63 transportation-related fatalities that year, the report states, 51 were non-Hispanic whites; and 10 were non-Hispanic blacks. In other words, we know that at least 61 of the 63 people who died were not Hispanic. There was no data on the origin of other two people -- so we don't know whether they were Hispanic or not -- but even if they were, that clearly would not warrant a conclusion that a rise in transportation-related deaths that year was tied to people not being able to read signs in English. (Alabama's population is 2.9 percent Hispanic.)

We're also not even sure why James cited a statistic from 2003. The BLS puts out these statistics every year. In 2004, there were 51 work-related transportation fatalities. All 51 were non-Hispanic. In fact, if you total up the numbers from 2003 through 2008, there were 319 transportation-related deaths. Of them, the reports note that 309 were non-Hispanic. The origin of the other 10 is not listed in the reports. But clearly, there is no basis to conclude that something as tangential as not being able to read signs in English is affecting those numbers one way or the other.

Karen Ransom, a regional economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Atlanta, said Dinkins clearly misspoke.

""We took a look at the numbers, and as you can see, that quote is simply not the case,"" she said. ""Of the 63, 61 were listed as non-Hispanic. Clearly that does not play out.""

We poked around but couldn't find any study that does suggests a higher rate of traffic accidents, fatal or not, among people who do not speak English. Nor could we find news reports of any traffic fatalities in Alabama caused by a driver's inability to understand a road sign in English.

We checked with Russ Rader, a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a group funded by the auto insurance industry that researches ways to reduce crashes. If anyone would know if non-English speakers are more of a driving hazard than English-speakers, this would be the group.

""We aren't aware of any studies that show non-English speakers get into crashes more frequently,"" Rader said.

We also called and wrote the James campaign for comment, but did not get a response.

In summary, James backed up his claims about concerns over public safety by citing a 2003 Bureau of Labor Statistics report that he claimed showed an alarming rise in work-related traffic fatalities due to the fact that increasing numbers of employees and drivers could not read or understand warning signs in English. The report does not state that. It doesn't even consider the issue. Rather, that's the speculation of a Bureau of Labor economist who was quoted in a 2004 news story. And that speculation is actually contradicted by the data in the report. We rate James' claim False.",/factchecks/2010/apr/29/tim-james/alabamas-tim-james-says-government-report-backs-hi/

That was #1 among all 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives.""We're always curious when we hear someone claim to be No. 1 in anything, so we looked into it.The Grayson campaign was slow in getting back to us with data to back up the claim, so we examined at Grayson's report on the Federal Election Commission website for the most recent quarter that ended March 31, 2010. We found he raised $809,111.83 in net contributions. We went to the Center for Responsive Politics site OpenSecrets.org and looked at a chart of the top 10 fundraisers for this current election cycle for candidates for the House of Representatives. On that list, Grayson is No. 6. We ran those 10 names -- which include eight incumbents and two other candidates -- through the FEC database to examine reports for the most recent fundraising quarter. The result: Grayson was third behind two Republican members of the House -- Eric Cantor of Virginia at $831,851.79 and Michele Bachmann of Minnesota at $810,991.74.The Federal Election Commission sent us a list of the top 10 fundraisers among candidates in the House for the most recent quarter. For incumbents, Grayson came in third behind Cantor and Bachmann.We showed the figures we found for Cantor and Bachmann to Grayson's office and asked how the campaign concluded that he was No. 1. Julie Tagen, senior advisor to the campaign, then acknowledged to us an in an e-mail that he was ""not number one last quarter.''But she added that, ""Although we were not number one last quarter, we are number one in the past two quarters combined,"" wrote Julie Tagen, senior advisor to the campaign. ""We were among the top fundraisers, and no campaign claims to have more donors than us. That makes us number one in the context of what we were discussing."" We don't believe there is sufficient public data for a campaign to prove her latest claim. Comparing the number of donors is a difficult task -- in part because donors who give less than $200 don't have to be reported. That would require calling all of the members of the House and asking for their donor lists -- something they would be hesitant to provide. We doubt the Grayson campaign had time to do that.But back to the claim we're checking: Grayson said in an e-mail to his supporters that he was ""#1 among all 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives.""We proved he was wrong because at least two others raised more, and his campaign has acknowledged the claim is not accurate.

"['National', 'Supreme Court', 'Arlen Specter']","
Specter says Congress can tell the Supreme Court what to consider
","With Washington bracing for President Barack Obama to announce his next Supreme Court nominee, Sen. Arlen Specter, a leading Democrat on his chamber's Judiciary Committee, has been sharing his views on the upcoming debate. During an interview on MSNBC's The Daily Rundown, Specter told hosts Chuck Todd and Savannah Guthrie that he thinks the court has been avoiding tough cases, such as the constitutionality of the terrorist surveillance program. Specter said he's even considering conditioning his vote for the nominee based on whether he or she will take up such cases. ""The Supreme Court has a very light backlog,"" he said. ""They leave a lot of splits among the circuits, a lot of uncertainty. And I think they ought to work a lot harder. . . . Congress can tell them which cases they ought to hear. We have that authority. And I think Congress ought to exercise it."" The last time we checked, there were strict barriers between the three branches of government, so we were curious about Specter's comment. Specter's comment is a bit cryptic; it reads as if he's saying that Congress can tell the court that it must hear a specific case. His office did not respond to our request for comment, but the experts we spoke with said that he's referring to Article III of the Constitution, which gives Congress the authority to establish appellate jurisdiction. ""In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make,"" the Article states. In plain English, all that means is that Congress can tell the Court what genre of cases it must hear. For instance, it must hear appeals on voting issues. Here's what section 5 the Voting Rights Act of 1965 said about states that seek to establish voting qualifications or prerequisites: ""Any action under this section shall be heard and determined by a court of three judges in accordance with the provisions of section 2284 of title 28 of the United States Code and any appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court."" So, appeals on decisions made by the special three-judge court regarding changes in voting qualifications must be heard by the Supreme Court. Appeals to the campaign finance rules set out in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 -- commonly known as the McCain-Feingold Act named for the two senators who wrote it -- face a similar trajectory: Complaints are first heard by a three-judge court, and are ultimately decided by appeal directly to the Supreme Court of the United States. The law also requires the Supreme Court to hear these cases in an expedited fashion. In fact, for much of the last century, many cases fell within the Supreme Court's mandatory jurisdiction, according to the legal scholars we spoke with. But in 1988, Congress passed a bill that abolished requirements that the Supreme Court hear most appeals cases (although it did preserve mandatory jurisdiction over some types of appeals cases, including voting rights cases). The idea was to save the Court precious time that it was otherwise wasting on appeals that had little significance. So, is Specter correct? ""It is up to Congress to identify which cases should go to the Court via appeal,"" Mark Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School, wrote to us in an e-mail. ""So, basically, Senator Specter's right."" ""Congress can't look around and say, 'Here's one particular case you have to decide on the merits,'"" Tushnet added. ""They do have to act in general terms."" Specter claimed that Congress can tell the Supreme Court which cases it must hear. According to the Constitution, Congress has the authority to do just that: it can write legislation that gives the court appellate jurisdiction over certain cases, as it did when it passed the Voting Rights Act. However, our experts said Congress cannot tell the Court that is must hear a specific case.

Gov. Rick Perry says that the Obama administration hasn't responded to his request for 1,000 National Guard members for more than a year
","
Saying foreign policy is most certainly a governor's business, Texas Gov. Rick Perry blasted the federal government for not doing enough to protect the border Texas shares with Mexico. 
""We do not have the resources or the manpower to secure the border the way it needs to be,"" Perry said during an April 15 interview with the online Texas Tribune and Newsweek magazine. ""We've got a 1,000 National Guard troop request that's been in front of this president for over a year and no response, so we are forced by Washington's inaction to take action ourselves."" 
Has President Barack Obama been a non-responsive pen pal? 
We learned from Perry's office that Perry first wrote Janet Napolitano, secretary of Homeland Security, to request more National Guard troops in February 2009. Napolitano had been in a similar pinch in 2008; as Arizona's governor, she twice called on the Department of Homeland Security to extend the two-year Operation Jump Start mission that stationed more than 6,000 National Guard members on the U.S.-Mexico border of four U.S. states. However, the mission ended as planned in July of that year. 
Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger told us last week that ""so far we've not received official approval or disapproval"" of Perry's February 2009 request. Cesinger also e-mailed us Perry's related correspondence with the Obama administration. 
Perry's Feb. 26, 2009, letter refers to his January 2009 phone conversation with Napolitano about the Texas-Mexico border. His letter states: ""As you know, the National Guard can play an important role in securing our border, which benefits not only the border states but the entire nation... as we discussed during our telephone conversation, an additional 1,000 Title 32 National Guard positions are needed..."" Title 32 service is primarily state active duty. 
In an April 2, 2009, letter to Napolitano, Perry asked to discuss his request for 1,000 National Guard troops; the letter also mentions the pair's March 26 phone conversation. 
On Aug. 21, Perry wrote President Obama, stating: ""As violence in northern Mexico continues, it is paramount that our international borders be secured to ensure the safety of our citizens and the security of our homeland. To reiterate my standing request with your administration, I respectfully ask that you authorize the use of 1,000 Title 32 National Guard personnel in support of civilian law enforcement along the Texas-Mexico border."" 
Perry followed up with a Sept. 1 letter to U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates mentioning the ""long-standing request."" And on March 12, Perry sent a fresh letter to Napolitano — this time asking for a Predator drone, an unarmed reconnaissance aircraft — to be based on the Texas border to support local, state and federal law enforcement. 
The upshot? The feds wrote back, but made no promises. 
Cesinger showed us a a June 24, 2009, letter from Napolitano to Perry acknowledging his Feb. 26 and April 2, 2009, letters. ""National Guard support is an option that is being seriously considered as part of our overall border strategy,"" Napolitano's letter states. 
Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, told us ""the administration continues to evaluate additional law enforcement options as needed, including the use of the National Guard, along the Southwest border. We continue to work with Congress on comprehensive reform of our immigration system, which would provide lasting and dedicated resources at our borders."" 
Chandler forwarded two more letters from Homeland Security to Perry. A March 1 letter from Juliette Kayyem, assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs, states on the White House's behalf that ""the authorization of additional National Guard resources remains an option that we continue to consider seriously as part of our overall strategy."" 
On March 19, Napolitano responded to Perry's drone request, writing that the department was considering expanding drone operations into West Texas. And on April 27, Napolitano told a Senate hearing that Texas would receive a drone, but didn't offer a timeline. 
Both Napolitano and Obama have also publicly spoken to Perry's request — though not encouragingly. 
In a March 2009 interview with reporters for regional newspapers including The Dallas Morning News, Obama said plans to deploy troops to the border weren't imminent: ""We've got a very big border with Mexico. I'm not interested in militarizing the border."" 
During a subsequent press briefing on U.S.-Mexico border security, a reporter asked Napolitano how Perry could persuade her to deliver the 1,000 National Guard troops. ""Why 1,000?"" Napolitano answered, according to a transcript of the briefing on the Homeland Security website. ""Where did that number come from? Where in Texas? Texas has a huge border with Mexico. What does he anticipate the Guard doing? And those are the kinds of things that I think then I will transmit to the secretary of defense and the president in the ongoing decision about Guard — yes, no, and if so how many and where."" 
Bottom line: The Obama administration has repeatedly acknowledged Perry's request for troops; it just hasn't given him the answer he seeks.

Arizona immigration law allows police to question 'anyone' who's 'reasonably suspicious' of being illegal
","When Arizona's Republican Gov. Jan Brewer signed the nation's toughest immigration law on April 23, 2010, did it open the door for rampant racial profiling? Generally speaking, the law -- which would go into effect in 90 days -- makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status.One of the key questions to emerge has been what standard law enforcement officers would need to use before questioning individuals about their immigration status. This topic came up on the April 26 edition of the MSNBC program Hardball, in a three-way discussion between host Chris Matthews; Republican state Sen. John Huppenthal, a supporter of the new law; and former Democratic state Sen. Alfredo Gutierrez, an opponent of the law. Here is an excerpt from their conversation, edited for space:Matthews: ""Under the law you passed and was signed by the governor this week, can a police officer who spots a car with five or six people in it, who he thinks because of instinct, experience, whatever, evidence, whatever you use -- can he stop that car and say, I think these people are here illegally, I'm going to stop and check them? Can he under the law do that, without any crime involved? Can he do that?""Huppenthal: ""No, he cannot. That would be -- that would just simply be racial profiling, and that would not be permitted under the law. Now, if he stopped them for speeding or something like that, he can inquire of the driver at that point if they were an illegal immigrant. But you're not going to find that kind of activity. That kind of kind of activity is not going to be -- that's not going to be a part of training. What is going to be a part of training, I arrest somebody for burglary, I arrest them for DUI, I arrest them after they've maimed somebody.""Gutierrez: ""Obviously, the senator hasn't read his own bill. What this bill does is, it says that any police officer can stop anyone who appears to them to be reasonably suspicious of being an undocumented person. And I'm going tell you something, if you and I are walking down the street, you're not going to be the subject ... of reasonable suspicion. He is simply wrong about his own bill. I suggest he read it.""We'll rate Huppenthal's contribution to this conversation in a separate item. Here we'll tackle Gutierrez' comment.Let's start by looking at exactly what the law says. Here's the part telling law enforcement officers that they need to check on individuals' immigration status:""For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of this state or a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person, except if the determination may hinder or obstruct an investigation.""But elsewhere, the bill inserts some limitations. Here's one:""A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not solely consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona constitution.""And here's another:""This section shall be implemented in a manner consistent with federal laws regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all persons and respecting the privileges and immunities of United States citizens."" These provisions cross-cut in a way that can be described either as nuanced or murky.On the one hand, law enforcement officers are told that ""for any lawful contact"" they have with an individual, they have to try to determine the individual's legal status if ""reasonable suspicion exists"" that the person is in the United States illegally. However, they cannot pursue an immigration status check ""solely"" because of race, color or national origin.So a key question is whether the law's stated protections against racial profiling are enough to protect someone from questioning if they are not suspected of committing a crime. If so, that would undercut Gutierrez' argument.In discussing these questions with legal experts, we found that everyone agreed that there's some gray area that will need to be sorted out in future court decisions. That said, the general consensus was that the protections against racial profiling will have some effect, but that it is unlikely to be a foolproof barrier.Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor, said that while racial profiling is not permissible, profiling based on, say, clothing or behavior is legal -- and rather common -- as long as the profile isn't based solely on race.""Police departments come up with profiles that can establish a resonable suspicion,"" Spiro said. Such profiles ""entitle an officer to stop someone and say, 'I'd like to ask you some questions?' The officer can then investigate, which could lead to probable cause."" And at that point, Spiro said, an immigration status check would be acceptable under the Arizona law.To be fair, it's not necessarily easy to use profiles in this way. Spiro said that the challenge is drawing up a defensible profile for spotting illegal immigrants. ""You can't stop someone just because they look Hispanic,"" Spiro said. ""There has to be some other factor or factors, not all of which are race-based, as well as some empirical explanation of why that profile establishes a reasonable suspicion. You have to come up with something beside race that sounds plausible as correlating with undocumented status, and it's hard to say what that would be.""In addition, nothing we've learned guarantees that law enforcement officers will fully exercise the powers they're granted under the new law -- or that judges will let them. But most legal experts we asked felt that the law opened the door to widespread police questioning of individuals.""In my mind, the ambiguity creates the danger of police abuse of persons of particular national origin ancestries and backgrounds,"" said Kevin Johnson, the dean of the law school at the University of California (Davis) and a specialist on immigration law. It's worth noting that Brewer herself provided little guidance as she explained her decision to sign the bill. When she was asked at a news conference how illegal immigrants would be identified, she said, ""I do not know what an illegal immigrant looks like. I can tell you that I think that there are people in Arizona that assume they know what an illegal immigrant looks like. I don't know if they know that for a fact or not."" Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, an adjunct law professor at Cornell University, agreed that this is a recipe for confusion. ""The courts will have a hard time deciding what constitutes a reasonable suspicion,"" he said.As we try to rate the accuracy of Gutierrez' statement, the degree of uncertainty about the law gives us pause, making us reluctant to rule either statement fully True or fully False. That said, we think that a close reading of the law and the views of the

experts we contacted do allow us to draw some conclusions.Gutierrez' statement -- that the law ""says that any police officer can stop anyone who appears to them to be reasonably suspicious of being an undocumented person"" -- is fairly accurate, but not entirely. While the law does appear to provide significant latitude for law enforcement officers in Arizona to question people about their immigration status -- on a pretext as basic as a broken taillight -- the law also says the grounds cannot be based on race or ethnicity alone. This is a somewhat more narrow standard than Gutierrez indicated, so we will downgrade his comment to Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/apr/28/alfredo-gutierrez/arizona-immigration-law-allows-police-question-any/

Arizona immigration law requires police to see a crime before checking legal status, GOP state senator says
","Does Arizona's tough new immigration law, set to take effect in 90 days, protect the innocent from police abuses?    Generally speaking, the law signed by Republican Gov. Jan Brewer on April 23, 2010, makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status.One of the key questions to emerge has been what standard law enforcement officers would need to use before questioning individuals about their immigration status. This topic came up on the April 26 edition of the MSNBC program Hardball, in a three-way discussion between host Chris Matthews; Republican state Sen. John Huppenthal, a supporter of the new law; and former Democratic state Sen. Alfredo Gutierrez, an opponent of the law. Here is an excerpt from their conversation, edited for space:Matthews: ""Under the law you passed and was signed by the governor this week, can a police officer who spots a car with five or six people in it, who he thinks because of instinct, experience, whatever, evidence, whatever you use -- can he stop that car and say, I think these people are here illegally, I'm going to stop and check them? Can he under the law do that, without any crime involved? Can he do that?""Huppenthal: ""No, he cannot. That would be -- that would just simply be racial profiling, and that would not be permitted under the law. Now, if he stopped them for speeding or something like that, he can inquire of the driver at that point if they were an illegal immigrant. But you're not going to find that kind of activity. That kind of kind of activity is not going to be -- that's not going to be a part of training. What is going to be a part of training, I arrest somebody for burglary, I arrest them for DUI, I arrest them after they've maimed somebody....""Gutierrez: ""Obviously, the senator hasn't read his own bill. What this bill does is, it says that any police officer can stop anyone who appears to them to be reasonably suspicious of being an undocumented person. And I'm going tell you something, if you and I are walking down the street, you're not going to be the subject ... of reasonable suspicion. He is simply wrong about his own bill. I suggest he read it.""We'll rate Gutierrez' contribution to this conversation in a separate item. Here we'll tackle Huppenthal's comment.Let's start by looking at exactly what the law says.Here's the part telling law enforcement officers that they need to check on individuals' immigration status:""For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of this state or a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person, except if the determination may hinder or obstruct an investigation.""So a key question is whether there be ""reasonable suspicion"" about someone's legal status in the absence of a crime -- major or minor -- being committed or suspected. If the answer is yes, it would undercut Huppenthal's argument.In discussing these questions with legal experts, we found that everyone agreed that there's some gray area that will need to be sorted out in future court decisions. That said, the general consensus was that police could indeed stop someone even in the absence of suspicion that a crime was being committed.Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor, said that law enforcement officers can use profiling rather than suspicions of a specific crime being committed.""Police departments come up with profiles that can establish a resonable suspicion,"" Spiro said. Such profiles ""entitle an officer to stop someone and say, 'I'd like to ask you some questions?' The officer can then investigate, which could lead to probable cause."" And at that point, Spiro said, an immigration status check would be acceptable under the Arizona law -- even if no specific crime was witnessed or suspected. ""If you came up with a profile for undocumented immigrants, that would establish reasonable suspicion, and you could stop that person even if no other crime was suspected,"" he said. This would seem to undercut Huppenthal's position. But one factor in his favor is that it's not necessarily easy to use profiles in this way. Spiro said the challenge is drawing up a defensible profile for spotting illegal immigrants. ""You can't stop someone just because they look Hispanic,"" Spiro said, because the law specifically says that officers ""may not solely consider race, color or national origin."" As a result, Spiro said, ""there has to be some other factor or factors, not all of which are race-based, as well as some empirical explanation of why that profile establishes a reasonable suspicion. You have to come up with something beside race that sounds plausible as correlating with undocumented status, and it's hard to say what that would be.""There are other reasons to believe that someone could be questioned on their immigration status without a police officer actually suspecting a crime. Jennifer Chacon, law professor at the University of California (Irvine), raises concerns about the phrase ""lawful contact."" ""Lawful contact can occur in many instances when there is no reasonable suspicion of a crime,"" she said. ""A consensual encounter, such as asking a police officer for directions, reporting a crime to a police officer, or being a victim of a crime or a witness and being questioned by a police officer, is a 'lawful encounter.' Also lawful are some stops premised on absolutely no individualized reasonable suspicion -- think about DUI checkpoints where everyone is stopped even if there is no individualized suspicion for the stop. The bill is clear that so long as the initial encounter is lawful, a police officer can then ascertain my legal status upon suspicion that I am undocumented. So Huppenthal is wrong if he maintains that only those suspected of criminal activity can be questioned regarding status. Under the plain language of the law, any time the police engage in a lawful encounter, that is enough to trigger the inquiry into status upon reasonable suspicion.""And some of the potential crimes that could lead to questioning involve seemingly innocuous actions.In an effort to curb day-laborer gathering points -- the ad-hoc spots where illegal immigrants have often offered themselves as informal laborers -- the law makes it unlawful ""for a person to enter a motor vehicle that is stopped on a street, roadway or highway in order to be hired by an occupant of the motor vehicle and to be transported to work at a different location if the motor vehicle blocks or impedes the normal movement of traffic."" It also is now ""unlawful for a person who is unlawfully present in the United States and who is an unauthorized alien to knowingly apply for work [or] solicit work in a public place."" And how does the law define ""solicit""? As a ""verbal or nonverbal communication by a gesture or a nod that would indicate to a reasonable person that a person is willing to be employed.""So, presumably, anyone getting into a car, or making a gesture or a nod in a public place, could fall under suspicion of violating these laws -- which in turn could open the door to an individual being questioned about their immigration status.None of this means that law enforcement officers will fully exercise these powers -- or that judges will let them. But most legal experts we asked felt that the law opened the door to police questioning of individuals who are not specifically suspected of committing a crime.Perhaps the ambiguities of the law will one day be settled in the courts. But we think that a close reading of the statute and the views of the experts we contacted allow us to draw some conclusions.Huppenthal's position -- that the police must suspect that something illegal is being committed before asking someone for proof of legal status -- is not correct. The law says the police officer just needs ""reasonable suspicion'' that the person is an alien who is unlawfully in the United States. The police are prohibited from using a profile based solely on racial or ethnic factors, but that standard can be sidestepped. In addition, some seemingly innocuous behaviors like getting in a car or making a gesture or nodding could be seen by a law officer as ""reasonable suspicion"" of the newly enacted prohibition against seeking work while in the United States illegally. The passage in the law citing racial profiling does provide some protection, as does the difficulty of defining a profile for illegal immigrants that could pass legal muster, but the law leaves open several possibilities for police questioning individuals without seeing or suspecting a specific crime. So we rate Huppenthal's statement False.",/factchecks/2010/apr/28/john-huppenthal/arizona-immigration-law-requires-police-see-crime-/
