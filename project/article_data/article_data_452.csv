No, these photos don’t prove monkeypox is a hoax
","People sharing photos of lesions caused by monkeypox and suggesting that because these images have been used in news coverage over the years, that proves the current outbreak of the virus is a sham.  ""Folks,"" one May 21 post says. ""If they’re sellin’ ya monkey pox, why don’t they at least use real, current pics? For God’s sake THINK about it!"" The post shows screenshots of four photos used in news stories in 2022 and years prior.  But it’s not unusual for media outlets to reuse such images to illustrate for readers what an infection could look like. And none of the news stories claim that these are new photos.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Since May 13, there have been reports of cases of monkeypox in countries where the virus is not normally found, including the United States, according to the World Health Organization. As of May 21, 92 cases had been confirmed, with between one and five cases in the U.S. Investigations into the origin of these outbreaks are ongoing.  In the United States, the first case was reported on May 18 after a resident returned to Massachusetts from Canada, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   One photo shows scabbed sores on a hand that appeared in both a May 21 Independent story about monkeypox and a CNN story from September 2018, when cases were being reported in the United Kingdom. We found the photo on Getty Images’ website. It was provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and shows the hand of one of the first known cases of the monkeypox virus in the United States in June 2003. We found this one on Getty Images, too. It was taken in June 2003 and shows ""the arms and legs of a 4-year-old girl infected with monkeypox"" in Liberia.  Then there’s a photo of a pair of hands with lesions that ran in a May 21 New York Daily News story and a 2018 Sun story. ""This 1997 image provided by the CDC shows the dorsal surfaces of the hands of a monkeypox case patient,"" the Daily News caption says.  On Getty’s website, the photo has a similar caption. The image was taken in the Republic of Congo.    Finally, there’s a photo of lesions on a man’s torso that ran in BBC stories about monkeypox in 2017 and in 2022 with a Reuters credit. We found a 2017 story about monkeypox in Nigeria on the BBC’s site but couldn’t find the image in the screenshot. Nevertheless, like the other photos in this post, its repeated use over time does not undermine the fact that there are real outbreaks of monkeypox happening across the world.  There’s nothing unusual about these photos being reused to show readers what an infection could look like.  We rate this post False.",/factchecks/2022/may/23/facebook-posts/no-these-photos-dont-prove-monkeypox-hoax/

Did Merrick Garland 'sic' police on parents at school board meetings?
","Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears recently said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland ""sicced police"" on parents who spoke out at school board meetings. Her statement came at the start of a May 12 television interview on ""Fox & Friends."" Earle-Sears, a Republican, was asked why Virginia was ""tolerating"" protests outside the Fairfax County homes of three U.S. Supreme Court justices who endorsed a draft ruling that would overturn Roe v. Wade. ""We’re not tolerating it,"" she replied. ""In fact, our governor has had the state police outside of their homes this whole time since the very first time it started. ""What we need now is for Merrick Garland to go ahead and do his job,"" she continued. ""You saw that he sicced the police on parents when they were at the school boards simply trying to be heard for the safety of their children."" Earle-Sears said Garland should be enforcing a federal law that bars protests near a judge’s residence that are aimed at influencing the ""discharge of his duty."" She accused Garland of ""selectively enforcing the laws"" and offered his actions on demonstrations at school board meetings as an example. Earle-Sears is entitled to her opinion on Garland’s fairness. But her claim that he ""sicced the police on parents"" doesn’t hold up. A number of conservatives have made similar statements, and fact checkers have found them False. We tried four times to contact Earle-Sears and her office and got no reply. Her claim is likely based on Garland’s October 2021 order that the FBI work with local governments to help handle what he called, ""a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence"" against school board members and educators. School systems in Virginia and across the nation had seen angry protests against mandatory mask wearing for students, transgender accomodation policies and the alleged teaching of critical race theory.  A raucous school board meeting in Loudoun County was recessed in June 2021 and resulted in the arrest of a father whose 15-year-old daughter had been sexually assaulted in a high school girls bathroom by a male student. Prosecutors later said the attacker was wearing a dress but did not characterize his gender identity. Garland’s order came six days after Biden received a letter from the National School Boards Association asking ""for federal law enforcement and other assistance to deal with the growing number of threats of violence and acts of intimidation occurring across the nation."" The association said the uprisings ""could be the the equivalent of domestic terrorism,"" a claim it subsequently retracted.  Garland's order did not direct localities to increase police presence at school board meetings or make arrests — local decisions that the attorney general does not control. An accompanying justice department news release said the order would establish training to help school board members ""understand the type of behavior that constitutes threats, how to report threatening conduct to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, and how to capture and preserve evidence of threatening conduct to aid in the investigation and prosecution of these crimes."" Republicans grilled Garland about the order during an October 2021 hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. He said parents have a constitutional right to complain about their children’s education at school board meetings and that he could not ""imagine a situation where [that] would be labeled as domestic terrorism.""  ""I want to be as clear as I can be,"" he said. ""This is not about what happens at school board meetings. It’s only about the threats of violence and violence aimed at school officials, employees and teachers."" Garland said federal officials would not be attending school board meetings and that his order did not suggest otherwise. Earle-Sears said, Garland ""sicced the police on parents when they were at the school boards simply trying to be heard for the safety of their children."" The word ""sic"" is defined as ""chase, attack — usually as a command especially to a dog."" Her comment apparently refers to Garland’s order in 2021 that the FBI work with local governments to help handle a national spike in threats against local school board members. Garland has said his goal is to enhance safety by training board members and educators how to recognize and report threats. Garland has no power to increase local police protection at school board meetings and has said that federal officials will not be attending them. He has said parents have a constitutional right to speak out at school board meetings; there is nothing in his order that says otherwise. We rate Earle-Sears' statement False.  ",/factchecks/2022/may/23/winsome-sears/did-merrick-garland-sic-police-parents-school-boar/

Indiana woman accused of of pre-marking ballots applications wasn’t accused of tampering with ballot
","A Facebook post from a few days after the 2020 presidential election is getting fresh attention online as people share claims about a woman identified as Janet Reed.  ""Indiana woman charged for mail in voter fraud, delivered 400 ballots with Democrat box pre-checked,"" the Nov. 10, 2020, post says. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Reed did get into legal trouble for election-related conduct, but the headline on this post  is misleading in that the criminal case the post is referring to pertained solely to absentee ballot applications — not actual ballots. And that becomes clearer the farther you read into the post. It goes on to say that ""this individual in Indiana delivered mail in ballot applications with 400 of these mail in ballots being pre-checked Democrat before delivery."" That gets closer to the truth. Janet Reed, a precinct committee member with the Vanderburgh County Democratic Party in Indiana, was arrested and charged in June 2020 with one count of unauthorized absentee ballot, a felony. She pleaded guilty in 2021 and was sentenced to 18 months of probation.  She was accused of sending absentee ballot applications to more than 400 voters. On the part of the application where voters indicate whether they want to vote in the Democratic or Republican primary, Reed had pre-checked the Democratic box. Essentially, that would have left voters with no choice but to participate in the Democratic primary election that June, the Evansville Courier & Press reported.  The county election office ""received and rejected over 400 of the pre-marked applications"" before the primary, the election board said in a statement, according to the Courier & Press. Vanderburgh County Clerk Carla Hayden said that her office sent replacement applications to affected voters so that they could get new absentee ballots for the primary.  In the general election, voters can cast ballots for candidates regardless of their party affiliation. We don’t know which voters Reed sent these applications to, or why. She refused to cooperate with investigators once she was arrested and she ""refused to provide an interview regarding her involvement in this case,"" the Courier & Press reported, citing an arrest affidavit. We couldn’t find any other information that illuminated her motivations.  A Facebook post claimed that an Indiana woman was ""charged for mail in voter fraud, delivered 400 ballots with Democrat box pre-checked."" That’s partially accurate but leaves out some some important details. Reed was charged for sending voters pre-checked absentee ballot applications so that they would receive a ballot for the Democratic Party’s primary. Reed did not pre-check the actual ballots. She pleaded guilty to a felony election fraud charge. Voters eventually got new unmarked applications.

Democrat Evers is not ‘a big proponent' of defunding police, as GOP challenger Kleefisch claims
","U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has declared ""defund the police is dead."" President Joe Biden, in his State of the Union address said: ""The answer is not to defund the police. It’s to fund the police.""  And, while some party members support ""defund the police efforts,"" Democrats have made no major effort to advance the idea, despite controlling Congress and the White House. Nevertheless, Republicans continue to label Democratic leaders as backing the approach.  Enter Rebecca Kleefisch, the former Wisconsin lieutenant governor, who is one of four Republicans hoping to unseat Gov. Tony Evers in November 2022. The other Republicans in the race are Tim Michels, Kevin Nicholson and Tim Ramthun. At an April 30, 2022, Take Back Wisconsin Town Hall event in Mequon, Kleefisch described Evers as ""a big proponent of this defund the police movement.""  Meanwhile, a pro-Kleefisch political action committee, the Freedom Wisconsin PAC, has begun airing a radio ad claiming ""liberals want to defund our police"" and urging Wisconsinites to ""stop Tony Evers, Joe Biden, and the liberals’ from doing so."" The phrase ""defund the police"" really entered the national consciousness in the wake of the May 25, 2020, murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a Minneapolis police officer who knelt on his neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds. That killing, and a host of other cases, helped fuel a summer of protests across the nation, including in Kenosha, where 29-year-old Jacob Blake was shot seven times from behind by a police officer and left partially paralyzed on Aug. 23, 2020.  To be sure, there are various proposals to reduce, redirect or even drastically cut the money spent on law enforcement. In some scenarios, the idea is to spend some of the money instead on community programs or mental health services with the hope it will mean less crime and fewer incidents that need a police response.  So, Kleefisch and Freedom Wisconsin are using the broadest of strokes in their characterization. But is Kleefisch right that Evers is ""a big proponent of this defund the police movement?"" No. She badly misses her target. We reached out to Kleefisch staff to ask them for backup for the claim, but after several days they did not respond. So let’s take a look at Evers and what he has said and done as it relates to the specific issue, and police funding generally. First, in a June 2020 meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, Evers backed having police departments overhaul how they use force, but specifically opposed slashing their funding. Most law enforcement officers ""are in the profession for the right reason,"" Evers said, ""so the idea of completely disassembling police in the state or Milwaukee, I couldn't support."" Indeed, the headline on the June 4, 2020 story read: ""Protesters have demanded police departments be 'defunded.' Tony Evers says that goes too far."" That same story noted Evers said: ""We're always going to need police service"" and that ""to completely defund police departments ... that isn't going to work.’"" So, all of that directly contradicts Kleefisch’s claim. In August 2021, Evers signed a bill that established a uniform use-of-force policy for police across Wisconsin. That same day, he did veto a Republican-backed bill that would have cut state aid to local governments that reduce their police budgets – a GOP measure aimed at countering any ""defund the police"" measures.    Meanwhile, Evers has taken other steps – chiefly with federal pandemic relief money – to direct more money to police departments.  In March 2022, Evers approved using $56 million to help police forces and courthouses across the state boost law enforcement and crime prevention programs, as well as to clear a backlog of criminal cases.  That was in addition to an earlier $45 million for public safety efforts announced in October, bringing the total to more than $100 million. Finally, at a March 18, 2022 WisPolitics.com luncheon, Evers declared ""hell yes"" when asked if he backed assisting Wisconsin communities tackle rising crime by getting them  more funding for police through increasing shared revenue.  So, that, too, undermines Kleefisch’s claim. Kleefisch claimed Evers is ""a big proponent of this defund the police movement."" She and her team did not offer any evidence to back her claim, but there is plenty that contradicts it – notably direct statements made by Evers, who has also used federal pandemic aid to provide more than an additional $100 million to local law enforcement. We rate the claim False.  ",/factchecks/2022/may/20/rebecca-kleefisch/democrat-evers-not-big-proponent-defunding-police-/

In Georgia’s governor’s race, Brian Kemp’s attack on David Perdue for US inflation is misleading
","Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, fending off a primary election challenge from fellow Republican David Perdue, blamed Perdue for soaring inflation. Perdue ""voted with liberals"" for $10 trillion ""in new debt"" and ""his out-of-control federal spending is driving inflation through the roof,"" a Kemp TV ad said. Debt rose by about $10 trillion during Perdue’s tenure as a one-term U.S. senator, from 2015 to 2021, but much of that was a bipartisan effort, not solely the work of ""liberals."" In addition, inflation has multiple causes, and some experts point to spending approved after Perdue left office as a key cause.  Kemp’s campaign did not provide us any information beyond what is cited in the ad to back up its attack on Perdue.  Words displayed in the ad refer to ""$10 trillion in debt"" and to the U.S. Treasury Department without citing a specific document or database.   Erica York, an economist with the Tax Foundation, pointed PolitiFact to Treasury Department figures showing that total debt increased about $10 trillion between 2015 and 2021, from roughly $18 trillion to $28 trillion. Perdue voted for a number of large, debt-raising measures. The Republicans’ 2017 tax cut increased deficits, but the parties came together on two large COVID-19 relief bills — $2 trillion in March 2020 and $900,000 in December 2020. President Donald Trump signed both.  Kemp praised the larger measure, saying in a March 2020 tweet: ""Thanks to @POTUS for signing the CARES Act and to Georgia’s congressional delegation for their strong support of this much-needed measure."" An important point that also undercuts Kemp’s statement is that much of the accumulated debt every year isn’t even voted on; it essentially adds up from spending that’s on autopilot. That is, automatic borrowing for Medicare and Medicaid, not debt approved by senators during Perdue’s tenure. Since Perdue left office in January 2021, the inflation rate has climbed to over 8%.  In Kemp’s ad, the words ""government spending to blame for inflation"" appear on the screen. That’s part of the headline on a March 30, 2022, Fox Business article about a study released two days earlier by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The study compared inflation in the U.S. and other developed countries.  The Federal Reserve analysis didn’t blame inflation solely on government spending. It said global supply chain problems and changes in spending patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic have pushed up inflation worldwide. The study did blame higher U.S. government spending for making inflation higher in the United States than in other developed nations since the first half of 2021.  Economic experts told PolitiFact in April that President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 spurred inflation. They differed on the precise scale of its impact, with estimates ranging from two to four additional points out of the inflation rate at the time of about 8.5%. The experts said past government spending, COVID-19’s disruptions to labor markets, energy prices and supply-chains also played significant roles. Most recently, the war in Ukraine has made a challenging situation worse. Georgia’s primary is May 24. If neither Perdue nor Kemp gets more than 50% of the vote, there would be a runoff June 21. Trump endorsed Perdue. The GOP nominee will face Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is unopposed. Kemp won his first term in 2018 by defeating Abrams, a former state lawmaker, by about 50% to 49%. Campaign watchers rate the Nov. 8 general election as a toss up and ""tilts Republican."" Kemp said in an ad that Perdue ""voted with liberals"" for $10 trillion ""in new debt, his out-of-control federal spending is driving inflation through the roof."" Debt rose about $10 trillion during Perdue’s time as a U.S. senator, but it didn’t accumulate only from votes by ""liberals"" to increase spending; much of the increase came from bipartisan votes and automatic spending by programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.  In addition, there are multiple causes for inflation, and some experts pointed to spending approved after Perdue left office as a key cause. Kemp’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

""Well this explains a few things,"" Owens appeared to say, adding an emoji with a distressed expression.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) These tweets are fake. And these ""new studies"" with troubling ivermectin findings don’t exist. The entire thing is fabricated.  (Screengrab from Facebook) The screenshot was shared by a Facebook account using the name ""Turning Points USA"" — an apparent jab at Turning Point USA, a conservative group founded by Charlie Kirk where Owens once worked as a spokesperson. PolitiFact searched Owens’ and Fox News’ verified accounts and archives of their tweets and found no evidence that either account had ever shared the tweets from the screenshot. Also, if you look closely at the upper right corner of the fake Fox News tweet in the image, you’ll see the phrase ""r/totallyrealtweets,"" which suggests the image is linked to a Reddit community that shares fake and satirical tweets. Ivermectin has been studied as a COVID-19 treatment, but neither the Food and Drug Administration nor the National Institutes of Health’s COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel recommend using ivermectin to treat COVID-19. As of April 29, the NIH panel ""recommends against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19, except in clinical trials."" In frequently asked questions from April 2021, the FDA said: ""While there are approved uses for ivermectin in people and animals, it is not approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19."" The FDA said that side effects associated with ivermectin use include things such as skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, limb swelling, sudden blood pressure drops and liver injuries. Because of the potential side effects, ""any use of ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 should be avoided as its benefits and safety for these purposes have not been established."" Public health organizations’ repeated warnings didn’t stop people from promoting the drug for COVID-19, and some doctors continue to prescribe ivermectin for the virus. Still, we found no evidence to suggest that ""long-term bowel and urinary incontinence"" should be among the legitimate concerns for people who used the anti-parasitic against COVID-19 in the face of such warnings. We were unable to find any ""new studies"" that found 68% of people who used ivermectin for COVID-19 were experiencing such side effects. Our searches for those studies turned up only fact-checks debunking these fake tweets and a 2017 study that looked at the effects of administering ivermectin to a large group of people in Democratic Republic of Congo. In that study, people reported ""a wide range of adverse events, including headache, coma, abnormal gait, stupor, asthenia, conjunctival hemorrhage, fever, back pain, urinary incontinence and psychiatric disorders"" after taking the drug.

Each part of the claim has been previously debunked. The claim that ""(Pfizer) says do not breastfeed"" appears to be a reference to falsehoods that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine isn’t recommended while breastfeeding. Those claims said the recommendation came from Pfizer, but included screenshots of a document published by United Kingdom health officials in late 2020, when COVID-19 vaccines were in their infancy and rollout had just begun, the Associated Press reported earlier this month. When initially published in December 2020, the UK document said COVID-19 vaccines should not be used while breastfeeding. The guidelines ""d(id) not indicate the shots are unsafe during pregnancy or while lactating but highlight a lack of data at the time of publication,"" Reuters reported. The UK document was later updated to remove the language about vaccines not being recommended during breastfeeding. The change reflected updated safety data and evidence showing that the vaccine is safe for breastfeeding women, according to the AP. British health authorities as well as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend COVID-19 vaccination for people who are breastfeeding. The second part of the claim in the Facebook post implies that domestic baby formula shortages are planned or deliberate. But the shortages are linked to supply chain problems that began during the COVID-19 pandemic, plus the recall of some formula that led to a manufacturing plant shutdown. Finally, the post claimed that ""Gates promotes brand new artificial breast milk technology,"" and also implies a link to current baby formula shortages. A startup company called BIOMILQ that makes artificial breast milk received $3.5 million from an investment fund co-founded by Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson. But the company says it’s still three to five years away from getting a product to market. We rate this claim False.

In Georgia race, election denier distorts Brad Raffensperger’s use of a Zuckerberg grant
","U.S. Rep. Jody Hice is running to be Georgia Secretary of State on a platform of false claims about the 2020 election. Hice, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, says he will be tougher on election integrity than his Republican rival, incumbent Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.  Raffensperger drew Trump’s wrath after he disputed Trump’s false statements about a stolen election.  Hice told Fox 5 news anchor Russ Spencer on May 5 that the election ""reeked of fraudulent activity."" Spencer responded that the FBI, state investigators and Trump’s attorney general, Bill Barr, found no credible allegations of widespread fraud. Spencer asked Hice about a phone call that Trump had with Raffensperger on Jan. 2, 2021, when Trump made a raft of false claims, such as that thousands of dead people had voted.  Hice defended Trump, saying that there were other numbers Trump didn’t bring up, including the ""$50 million of Zuckerberg money that Brad Raffensperger used to tip the scales.""  Hice’s campaign did not respond to our emails asking for his evidence. Hice’s statement gave a distorted picture of a grant awarded to the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office and inflated the size of that grant ninefold.  In 2020, election officials faced an expensive and unprecedented challenge: pulling off a safe national election during a pandemic. The 2020 pandemic relief package known as the CARES Act included $400 million in election funding. But that wasn’t enough to cover all of the new expenses, which would include a massive increase in voting by mail. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, formed by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, stepped forward to help close the gap. The initiative gave money to nonprofits to then award grants to election offices. The nonprofits selected the recipients, not the Zuckerberg Initiative. The Center for Election Innovation & Research oversaw the distribution of about $65 million. The center, founded in 2016 by David Becker — previously the director of the elections program at The Pew Charitable Trusts — works with secretaries of state to help them maintain accurate voter registration lists and secure election technology. The goal of the grants was to help states pay for nonpartisan voter outreach. The center invited all states to apply. The 23 that responded received the amount of money they requested. Seven of those state agencies were led by Republican election officials, while 10 were led by Democratic election officials, and six were led by nonpartisan or bipartisan boards of elections. Georgia received about $5.6 million. States could spend money on direct mail, ads, and other communications such as establishing voter hotlines. In Georgia, the money was spent on TV ads.  Hice said that Raffensperger used the money to ""tip the scales"" — suggesting Raffensperger wanted to aid or disadvantage a particular candidate. We found no evidence of such a scheme.  So where does Hice’s $50 million figure come from? It’s possible that he was referring to a separate set of grants, also from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, of $350 million to the Center for Tech and Civic Life. That organization distributed grants nationwide to 2,500 local elections offices. Dozens of counties in Georgia applied and received funds that added up to about $45 million. Local election offices used the grants to pay for staff, personal protective equipment and election equipment to sort absentee ballots. Some Republican state lawmakers across the nation objected to populous Democratic strongholds getting the largest amounts of money through that initiative, although every jurisdiction in red and blue areas that applied received money. Grants ranged from $5,000 for small townships to $19 million for New York City.  Raffensperger’s office said that he had no authority to prevent counties from receiving the grants.  The Georgia State Assembly in 2021 was among many GOP-led states that later passed a ban on local election officials accepting private grants. Hice is among the Republican candidates challenging Raffensperger in the May 24 primary. If no candidate wins more than 50%, the top two vote getters will advance to a June 21 runoff. Hice has repeatedly denied the reality that Biden won the presidential race. He backed the unsuccessful case before the U.S. Supreme Court that sought to overturn results in a few states including Georgia. Hice also objected to accepting Georgia’s electoral college votes on Jan. 6, 2021. Hice told the Washington Post in February, ""Yes, I believe Trump won. If we were to get an accurate count of the votes in Georgia, I believe absolutely Trump won Georgia."" Raffensperger has defended his handling of the 2020 election in Georgia, where the results were backed up by three counts.  Hice said that Georgia’s secretary of state used ""$50 million of Zuckerberg money"" in 2020 to ""tip the scales."" In 2020, the Secretary of State received a $5.6 million grant from the Center for Election Innovation and Research for nonpartisan voter outreach. But Georgia had plenty of company – 23 states, led by both Republican and Democrat officials, received grants. There is no evidence that Raffensperger used the money to ""tip the scales.""  Dozens of counties in Georgia received grants from the Center for Tech and Civic Life that added up to about $45 million, but Raffensperger had no say in which counties applied for grants. Both grant programs were funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to help election officials cover the extra expenses of administering elections amid a pandemic. Hice has distorted the amount of grant money received by Raffensperger and the purpose. We rate this statement False. RELATED: 'Zuckerbucks' for 2022 elections?

Heritage analyst: Obama administration released 134,000 criminal aliens
","The sanctuary city movement has drawn much fire since the shooting death of a young woman visiting San Francisco in early July. The man accused of the killing should never have been in the country in the first place but, despite a request from federal immigration officials, had been released from a San Francisco jail. By local ordinance, San Francisco employees generally don’t help enforce immigration laws. In a column published by the conservative Heritage Foundation July 9, 2015, Heritage analyst Hans von Spakovsky charged that the sanctuary movement leaves Americans vulnerable to crime at the hands of non-U.S. citizens. For von Spakovsky, this is all in keeping with White House policy. ""In fiscal year 2013, the Obama administration released over 36,000 convicted criminal aliens awaiting the outcome of deportation hearings upon an unsuspecting public, and another 30,558 in fiscal year 2014 according to the House Judiciary Committee,"" von Spakovsky wrote. ""And in 2013 alone, the administration didn’t even bring removal proceedings against an additional 68,000 criminal aliens convicted of everything from homicide to sexual assault."" Von Spakovsky added it up and issued a chilling warning. ""If the over 134,000 aliens released by the administration in just the past two years follow the pattern of those aliens studied by the GAO (Government Accountability Office) in 2005, they will commit hundreds of thousands of more crimes, victimizing countless innocent Americans in crimes that could have been prevented."" In this fact-check, we focus on the claim that the administration moved to release about 134,000 criminal aliens. We exchanged emails with von Spakovsky but ultimately did not get any answers to the questions we raised. However, his column pointed to his sources. Convicted criminals As you might guess from von Spakovsky’s words, there are two sets of criminal aliens -- one group of about 66,000 (36,000 + 30,558) and another of about 68,000. We’ll take each in turn. The group of 66,000 stems from a report from the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that favors reduced immigration. The people in this category have been convicted of a crime, served their sentence in jail or prison and were then turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for deportation. The center’s director of policy studies Jessica Vaughan looked at the federal numbers for 2013, and the House Judiciary Committee took a similar approach for 2014. Federal officials confirm the accuracy of the overall numbers. According to ICE data, the agency released 36,007 criminals in 2013 and 30,558 in 2014 (both are fiscal years.) The most significant caveat comes from Vaughan, who told us that by her calculations (not included in the report), about 45 percent of the releases were the result of a court order, not administration policy. In some instances, an immigration judge issued the ruling. In a smaller number of cases, the driving force was a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2001 that limits how long immigration authorities can hold people once they’ve served the sentence that put them behind bars. Either way, the judiciary said the government could no longer detain the person as it waited to move forward with deportation. ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea told us that ""the majority of releases of serious criminal offenders were made pursuant to federal court decisions or bond decisions by immigration judges."" How you apportion responsibility depends on your point of view. ""Just over half of the releases came because ICE decided to release them,"" Vaughan said. Plus, Vaughan noted that ICE has the option to challenge a court’s ruling but rarely does. Investigative reporters at the Atlanta Journal Constitution and the Boston Globe also found that pattern. (Those articles documented the failure of ICE to monitor violent criminals after release or warn their past victims, sometimes with deadly consequences.) For the purposes of this fact-check, the prime significance of these court orders is that the administration did not choose on its own to release nearly half of these criminal aliens. When von Spakovsky faulted the Obama White House for releasing these people, he failed to note the role of the courts, which reduces by some large percentage the overall total of 66,000 attributable to the administration . A failure to deport There is no doubt that all of these people were deportable. They were sitting in ICE custody as their case was processed which raises the question, why wasn’t the government able to follow through? In some cases, the person’s home country refused to accept them. A hat tip goes to investigative reporter Jeremy Redmon at the Atlanta Journal Constitution who used the Freedom of Information Act to get hard numbers from ICE. When we crunched that data, we found that in FY 2013, home country refusal led to the release of 3,746 people. Over 80 people convicted of homicide were on that list. Nearly half of them came from Cuba, a country that routinely rejects any prisoners from the United States. Vietnam came in second, refusing to take back 15 convicted killers. 68,000 criminal aliens This second group in von Spakovsky’s tally is much harder to pinpoint. Von Spakovsky said their crimes range ""from homicide to sexual assault."" In reality, the range is much wider. According to Vaughan, the great majority of these people have come to ICE’s attention because they were reported by local police or some other law enforcement agency. Their crimes include misdemeanors and felonies. And in some cases, Vaughan said the criminal alien label comes when an ICE agent decides that the person represents a criminal threat (meaning they haven’t been accused of a crime), an obviously subjective assessment. The meaning of ""criminal alien"" itself is broad. The term includes anyone who is not an American citizen and includes both those who are here legally and those who aren’t. The label can apply to a wide range of crimes from breaking immigration laws, to driving without a license, to more serious offenses like sexual assault, rape and murder. Some people are deportable and some are not. Von Spakovsky cited Vaughan’s work. But Vaughan told us the data available from ICE is limited. The agency reported the total number of criminal aliens who came to its attention in 2013. It reported the number of deportation orders it initiated with that group. The difference came to nearly 68,000. The government data show that ICE decided not to deport the person. However, it doesn’t show what happened to the person beyond that. ""If ICE doesn't pursue deportation, that person might be released immediately or not,"" Vaughan said. ""They might serve out the duration of their sentience. There are a variety of possible outcomes."" The point is, while von Spakovsky said the administration released these people, there are several missing pieces. Most of them were not in federal custody to begin with. We don’t know that they were released. And given the broad meaning of criminal alien, it isn’t certain that every person was deportable in the first place, and so ICE wouldn’t have that option. That said, as a matter of policy, ICE picks and chooses the sort of criminals to deport. The Department of Homeland Security issued guidelines in November 2014 that established a hierarchy of criminal offenses. Adam Cox, a law professor at New York University, has studied this for several years. Cox said ICE discretion is crucial. ""These data show clearly that the agency is not simply arresting every person it identifies,"" Cox said. ""The data also show, however, that the likelihood that ICE chooses to detain a person identified through fingerprint screening goes up as the person's criminal record becomes more serious."" In a prepared statement, ICE told us that the agency ""prioritizes its available resources on those who pose the biggest threat to national security, border security and public safety."" Our ruling Von Spakovsky said that the Obama administration had released about 134,000 criminal aliens. There are several flaws in this statement. About half of von Spakovsky’s total, 66,000, involved convicted criminals who had completed their sentences but remained in custody pending deportation. For some large fraction of that group, perhaps as high as 45 percent, it was a court ruling that drove the release, not a decision by the administration. Regarding the other half of von Spakovsky’s total, 68,000, it is likely that in most cases ICE decided not to pursue deportation. However, some portion of that group might not have been deportable, and some portion might have continued to serve out a locally imposed sentence and not been released. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/16/hans-von-spakovsky/heritage-analyst-obama-administration-released-134/

Deal puts Iran's nuclear program under lock, key and camera 24/7, says Rep. Don Beyer
","Now that the Obama administration has negotiated a nuclear agreement with Iran, it’s time for Congress to see whether opponents can muster enough votes to scuttle the deal. Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., came out early with an op-ed supporting the agreement. Published on July 14, 2015 -- just as the agreement was being announced in the United States -- Beyer’s column had a straightforward title: ""Why I’ll vote in favor of the Iran nuclear deal."" ""Thanks to the Obama administration’s negotiations,"" Beyer wrote, ""Iran’s nuclear program will be under lock, key and camera 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The eyes of the international community are on every centrifuge, every ounce of uranium, in all of Iran’s nuclear facilities. Inspectors have ‘when needed, where needed’ inspection rights to any Iranian military site suspected of being involved in the nuclear program."" We wondered whether it’s accurate for Beyer to say that ""Iran’s nuclear program will be under lock, key and camera 24 hours a day, 365 days a year."" So we checked the text of the agreement and asked a range of experts. We found that -- as might be expected for a lengthy agreement that has barely been available for scrutiny and that hasn’t yet been tested in practice -- there’s quite a bit of room for disagreement in interpretation. Beyer’s strongest argument concerns certain specific Iranian assets that will be under 24/7 monitoring by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA. According to the agreement, ""for 15 years, Iran will permit the IAEA to implement continuous monitoring, including through containment and surveillance measures, as necessary, to verify that stored centrifuges and infrastructure remain in storage, and are only used to replace failed or damaged centrifuges."" This round-the-clock monitoring will explicitly include ""electronic seals which communicate their status within nuclear sites to IAEA inspectors, as well as other IAEA approved and certified modern technologies,"" according to the agreement. For instance, at an Iranian facility like Natanz, where more than 5,000 centrifuges will be operating, the IAEA will have cameras that provide 24-hour monitoring, said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear specialist at the Harvard Kennedy School. In addition, the agreement says, ""Iran will permit the IAEA regular access, including daily access as requested by the IAEA, to relevant buildings at (the Iranian nuclear facility at) Natanz ... for 15 years."" However, this sort of 24/7 surveillance will not be the rule everywhere in the Iranian nuclear archipelago. ""At most locations, inspections will be every once in a while, on a schedule the inspectors judge to be sufficient based on the sensitivity of the activities at that location, how long it would take for Iran to do something there that would make a difference, and so on,"" Bunn said.    For this reason,""I would not say it’s accurate that the entire program is under ‘lock, key, and camera 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,’ "" Bunn said. The other sites have ""the potential to be inspected at any time, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, but in reality there won’t be inspectors or cameras physically there all the time."" In fact, even if Iran ultimately agrees to a contentious inspection, the wait could be as long as 24 days. The agreement spells out that if the IAEA and Iran can’t work out their differences over suspicions about undeclared nuclear materials or activities within 14 days, a joint commission empowered by the agreement would try to resolve the situation for another seven days. Once the commission decides what to do, Iran would have three more days to follow through. There is wide agreement that the inspection protocols are the most stringent devised for any country not defeated in war. But there is less agreement on whether that standard is sufficient to stop a country intent on getting nuclear weapons from getting them. Rick Brennan, a senior political scientist at the Rand Corp., a think tank, calls the protocol a ""far cry"" from the ironclad promises Beyer makes. ""There are a number of provisions in the monitoring regime that enable Iran to delay, obstruct, and eventually prevent IAEA inspectors from effectively monitoring any portion of the Iranian nuclear program that it seeks to hide,"" Brennan said. Five of the eight members of the joint commission would have to agree to both the concerns of the IAEA and the protocols involving that specific inspection, he said, calling it ""an extremely high hurdle because China and Russia will almost certainly side with Iran on most issues."" Theodore R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, agreed. ""The real problem is this: When inspectors get delayed, denied, hassled, bugged, followed, or pelted by stones from ‘spontaneous’ mobs, what do you do? We should recall that Clinton bombed Iraq in Operation Desert Fox in 1998. Will Obama do that? I very much doubt it,"" he said. However, other experts say that for many key sites, a 24-day wait is still sufficient, given the complexity of the nuclear process and the time required to construct and ramp up the needed infrastructure. At an Iranian facility known as Arak, for instance, a reactor ""is years away from being able to operate -- it would be pointless to have inspectors there 24/7,"" Bunn said. Bunn also cited the experience of the secret 2007 bombing of a nuclear site in Syria. ""The Syrians bulldozed the entire site and cleaned it up and blocked IAEA access until months later, but the IAEA still found uranium particles that couldn’t be easily explained,"" a discovery that led to the IAEA’s conclusion that it had been a nuclear site, Bunn said. This is the argument Obama is making. ""As for the fact that it may take 24 days to finally get access to the site, the nature of nuclear programs and facilities is such, this is not something you hide in a closet,"" he said at a July 15 press conference. ""This is not something you put on a dolly and kind of wheel off somewhere.  And, by the way, if we identify an undeclared site that we’re suspicious about, we’re going to be keeping eyes on it. So we’re going to be monitoring what the activity is, and that’s going to be something that will be evidence if we think that some funny business was going on there that we can then present to the international community."" Ultimately, the plan’s supporters and its critics both make fair points, said Richard Nephew, a research scholar and program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University. ""It is true that there will be a process for granting access to some sites, and it is also true that this will take time and that critics think it is too much time,"" Nephew said. Our ruling Beyer said, ""Thanks to the Obama administration’s negotiations, Iran’s nuclear program will be under lock, key and camera 24 hours a day, 365 days a year."" Parts of Iran’s nuclear complex will indeed be under high-tech surveillance and monitoring around the clock. But for other parts of the country’s nuclear infrastructure, there will be no such direct surveillance, and inspectors won’t have the right to barge in whenever they want -- they could be delayed for as long as 24 days. While some experts say such delays won’t undercut the agreement’s effectiveness, others disagree.

Bobby Jindal says nearly 100 percent of New Orleans students attend a charter school
","Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal appeared on Fox News Sunday July 12, 2015, to talk policy, taxes and Louisiana's success. He especially lauded the state’s advances in education. ""In Louisiana, we privatized our state charity hospital system. We've got statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child instead of the child following the dollars. In New Orleans, nearly 100 percent of our kids are in charter schools. Doubling the number doing reading and math on grade level in five years."" Not a lot of school districts across the nation can claim charter school attendance rates that are quite so high. Using data from the 2012-13 school year, 92 percent of school districts had less than half of their total students attending a charter school. Is New Orleans that different? According to data, the answer is yes. In 2012-2013, the New Orleans School District had 84.1% of all its students attending charter schools. In 2013-14 that number increased to 91 percent. New Orleans’ charter school rate is uncharacteristically high even compared to other Louisiana districts, as the following chart shows.  Why do students overwhelmingly attend charter schools in New Orleans? The answer may have something to do with the sheer number of charter schools there. Of the 82 schools currently in the Orleans Parish, 76 are charter schools. Only 6 are non-charter public schools. Why so many? The history of charter schools in New Orleans tracks back to 1995. That year, Louisiana passed its first charter school law, which allowed up to eight volunteer districts to have charter schools established. In 1997, the law was changed so that any districts could volunteer, although ""the number of charter schools statewide was capped at 42."" In 1998, the first charter school opened in New Orleans. However, it would be almost a decade before charter schools became prevalent in there. The Louisiana Legislature established the Recovery School District in 2003. The RSD ""is a special school district run by the Louisiana Department of Education that intervenes in the management of chronically low-performing schools."" That year, ""chronically low-performing schools"" were defined as those that earned the ""lowest performance label, Academically Unacceptable (AUS), for four consecutive years."" That first year, 17 schools were identified for takeover. Sixteen of those schools were in New Orleans. After the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education gave the RSD the green light to take control of the schools, the RSD had the choice of either ""directly operat(ing) the schools itself, or to contract with universities or non-profit organizations to operate them as charter schools."" Laura Hawkins, the deputy chief of staff at RSD, said the RSD always had the goal of establishing charter schools, believing from the start that it was ""the best strategy."" Still, before 2005, there were only a handful of charter schools in New Orleans. ""Charter schools were a nascent movement,"" said Hawkins. And then Hurricane Katrina came. Brian Beabout, a professor of educational leadership at the University of New Orleans, has studied education reform in post-Katrina New Orleans. ""In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, (New Orleans) temporarily lost 100 percent of its students and did not reopen a single school for more than two months,"" Beabout wrote in a 2007 article. When the Orleans Parish School Board did reopen public schools in January 2006, those schools were reopened as charters. Why? ""OPSB opted to open the schools as charter schools to take advantage of the U.S. schools,"" said a Cowen Institute report. ""(The OPSB) had easy access to government money,"" said Hawkins. Part of the Katrina legacy  After the hurricane, many in New Orleans realized they had the opportunity to start with a ""clean educational slate"" and restructure the school system. In response, the state Legislature introduced Act 35. ""(This) amendment changed the focus from chronically failing individual schools and added a ‘district in academic crisis,’ "" Beabout said. ""(The amendment) was tailored specifically to wrest control of New Orleans public schools from the locally elected school board and put them in the hands of the RSD. They defined any district with a certain percent of failing schools as ""in crisis"" and took control of all schools in the district which performed below the state average. Initially, 114 schools were transferred over the RSD for control. The Cowen Institute reports that under Act 35, the RSD ""was empowered to lease, rebuild, or renovate the school facilities as necessary for the successful operation of schools, but it could not sell any school buildings, as they still belonged to the OPSB."" Because of the sudden increase of schools given to it for control, the RSD did not have enough approved charter organizations established. Because of this, the RSD took direct control of some schools as a school district. Over the years, as more charters were established, the number of schools run directly by the RSD decreased. In 2014, the RSD became a 100 percent charter school district. For the record, all of this largely played out before Jindal was elected governor in 2007. Our ruling Jindal said that ""in New Orleans, nearly 100 percent of our kids are in charter schools."" As of the 2013-14 school year, 91 percent of student in New Orleans go to charter schools. However, the high percentage is a reflection of the fact that the majority of schools in New Orleans are charter schools. Most of them were established after public schools within ""in crisis"" school districts (read New Orleans Public Schools) were handed over to the state-controlled RSD in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Over the years, these schools were converted to charter schools. Jindal’s statement is accurate.

Would Rubio's tax plan mean a big break for millionaires?
","Hillary Clinton outlined her economic vision in detail for the first time during her presidential campaign, calling for a ""growth and fairness"" economy in a speech at the New School in Manhattan on July 13, 2015.  She also lambasted a select group Republican presidential candidates for their purportedly out-of-touch approach toward the working class. Among the targets were Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. Clinton singled out Rubio’s proposed tax plan: ""Another priority must be reforming our tax code. Now, we hear Republican candidates talk a lot about tax reform. But take a good look at their plans. Sen. Rubio's would cut taxes for households making around $3 million a year by almost $240,000, which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family."" We decided to fact-check the somewhat intricate claim. Rubio’s plan Clinton’s campaign directed us to a blog post from the Tax Policy Center, an independent think tank that analyzes tax policy. The article concerns Rubio’s plan in general, but the pertinent part reads, ""Those in the top 0.1 percent, who make $3.3 million and up, would be in line for an average tax cut of $240,000 — a boost in after-tax income of 3.8 percent."" Is $240,000 more than ""three times"" the earning power of a typical family? Her campaign pointed us to U.S. Census Bureau data that showed median household income as $53,046 for the period 2009 to 2013. So those numbers back up Clinton’s statement. But there is one minor complication: The article from the Tax Policy Center is based on an analysis of Utah Sen. Mike Lee’s 2013 plan, not Rubio’s plan (actually a joint venture with Lee) that was released in 2015 and is similar to the original Lee plan. Generally speaking, the Rubio-Lee plan groups people into two income tax brackets, 15 percent or 35 percent, the higher of which would kick in at an individual income of $75,000. That’s a decrease from the seven brackets currently in place. Another centerpiece of the plan is a $2,500 tax credit given to parents for each child under sixteen. That’s the broad outline, but the plan still lacks some details.  ""There are critical unresolved issues that make it difficult for us to do an analysis of Rubio’s current plan,"" said Howard Gleckman, resident fellow at the Tax Policy Center and author of the blog post. For example, Gleckman points out that the Rubio-Lee plan never specifies exactly what would happen to a personal tax credit of $2,000, a subsidy that would be available to anybody who claimed it on their tax returns. If it were included as a refundable tax credit (meaning people could get a check back), it would have a significant impact on low-income families. As of now, their incomes would actually decrease under the Lee plan, according to the Tax Policy Center’s analysis. ""Qualitatively, the rough sense is a very generous tax cut for high-income people,"" said Gleckman, adding, ""What we’re not sure about is low-income people."" So low-income people might get some kind of tax break under Rubio’s plan, or they might not. The other thing to know about Clinton’s statement is that the wealthy get a tax break under Rubio’s plan because he wants tax reductions, and the wealthy pay the most taxes. ""The reason why the top is getting what’s seemingly a big tax cut is that they’re already taxed at a much higher rate,"" said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group. Under the Rubio plan, the top tax rate would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. Pomerleau added that it’s crucial to remember that the plan proposes tax cuts across all income brackets, not just the top ones, and often at higher percentages for those with lower incomes. Pomerleau, however, did say that he found Clinton’s claim plausible. Our ruling Clinton said that Rubio’s tax plan ""would cut taxes for households making around $3 million a year by almost $240,000, which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family."" It is possible to take issue with the statement in some ways. The source of her claim uses an earlier version of Rubio’s plan in its analysis,  and she said $3 million when she should have said $3.3 million. But the thrust of her statement is sound. An analysis of a plan extremely similar to the one put forth by Rubio would cut taxes for those making $3.3 million and more by nearly $240,000, which is more than three times the U.S. median household income of $53,046.

Hillary Clinton says she's engaged local media 'all along'
","In an segment that aired July 7, Hillary Clinton sat down for her first nationally televised interview since announcing her second bid for president in April. Toward the end of the roughly 19-minute conversation, CNN senior political correspondent Brianna Keilar asked Clinton about her ""arm’s length"" relationship with the media so far. Pointing to the decision to hold off on national interviews until this point, Keilar asked, ""What's changed? Why now?"" Clinton began by telling Keilar that ""nothing’s really changed."" All along, Clinton said, she wanted to focus the first phase of her campaign on conversations with average Americans, particularly because it had been several years since she was actively engaged in domestic policy issues. ""I'm not running my campaign for the press. I'm running it for voters,"" Clinton said. ""I totally respect the press and what the press has to do. But I wanted and was determined to have the time that I needed to actually meet and listen to people."" Later, Clinton said she would continue to do ""more press"" and added, ""I did local press all along, the last three months because, again, it was interesting to see what questions the local press would be asking me."" Given the scrutiny surrounding Clinton’s national media strategy, we decided to take a closer look at this statement: Had she consistently opened herself up to local reporters throughout the first three months of her campaign? Politifact New Hampshire first asked her team for documentation of all media availabilities since she announced her campaign on April 12. Clinton’s New Hampshire staff provided a list that included all media availabilities in New Hampshire so far this year as well as additional interviews conducted with local news outlets in South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada. We also took a look at pool reports compiled by journalists who have been following Clinton since she announced her candidacy, as well as reports from national journalists who kept track of how many press questions Clinton answered at the beginning of her campaign. As we looked into this claim, we relied on the historic practice of ""doing local press"" in the New Hampshire primary, which includes some or all of the following: on-camera interviews, one-on-one questions with reporters and editorial board meetings with local or state news organizations. During her inaugural campaign visit to Iowa on April 14 and 15, Clinton did not offer any official media availabilities but did respond to stray questions from reporters who were shadowing her outside of a community college and other stops. Questions included one asking her what she’d say to Americans who want to know why she’s running, some others on campaign finance and the significance of the Iowa caucus, as well as, ""How are you liking Iowa?"" The following week in New Hampshire, Clinton responded to several questions from reporters — including two from a reporter for WMUR, a New Hampshire TV station — after a roundtable at Whitney Brothers in Keene, N.H., on April 20. And the press corps took notice. ""Despite being bombarded with press questions at every chance, Clinton has only personally answered a handful of inquiries since formally launching her campaign April 12,"" National Journal’s Zach C. Cohen noted in a story published April 27.  ""Instead, she has spoken directly to voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, taking their questions in small-scale events."" In total, as documented by Tamara Keith at NPR, Clinton responded to 13 questions from reporters between April 14 (her first campaign visit in Iowa) and May 13 (one month and a day after she announced her campaign in a video posted online). Then, on May 19 in Iowa, following an event in Cedar Rapids, Clinton took another seven questions from journalists, according to follow-up reporting from NPR. (That included one question about whether Clinton would be taking journalists’ questions.) Clinton didn’t appear to distinguish between local and national media during that first month, responding to questions shouted from journalists representing ABC and the Associated Press, as well as from WMUR and an Iowa political television show. Almost exactly two months into her campaign, Clinton’s team started offering more access to local and state news outlets. On June 14, Clinton began sitting down for interviews with local news outlets in Iowa. She followed up with additional local media interviews in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina in the days ahead. One of those interviews was with the Concord Monitor, a Politifact affiliate. In that case, Clinton answered six questions in an interview that lasted a little less than 10 minutes after speaking at a June 15 rally in Concord. Since then, Clinton has conducted additional interviews with local reporters during July visits to New Hampshire and Iowa. In New Hampshire, for example, she gave interviews to WKXL Concord News Radio, the Conway Daily Sun, the Coos County Democrat/Berlin Reporter and the Berlin Daily Sun on July 3 and 4. As pointed out by National Journal’s Emily Schultheis in a story about Clinton’s media strategy in May, ""national headlines were never the point"" for her campaign team. ""Instead, they're betting—and given the subject of the national conversation, almost certainly hoping—that what matters right now is happening much closer to the ground: the connections she makes with early-primary state voters, the persona she builds in key areas, and the buzz she generates with local activists,"" Schultheis noted at the time. In her sit-down interview with CNN, Clinton reflected on that strategy. She pointed to the ""ramp-up"" phase of the campaign, which centered on discussions in small-group settings over large-scale rallies or other events — and said they caused her to more seriously prioritize issues like substance abuse and mental health in her campaign. Our ruling In her first sit-down interview with a national television reporter, Hillary Clinton said, ""I did local press all along, the last three months."" A review of Clinton’s interactions with the media during the first three months of her campaign shows that she offered numerous interviews with local news outlets during the third month of that time frame. Prior to that, however, her interactions with with local news outlets were just about as scarce as they were with national outlets. It’s an exaggeration for her to say that she had been engaging with reporters at the local level for three months. On balance, we rate her claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/jul/15/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-shes-engaged-local-media-all-/
"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump says Florida had five 'sanctuary cities' when Jeb Bush was governor
","Donald Trump criticized GOP primary rival Jeb Bush’s stance on immigration, implying the former governor allowed parts of Florida to shield illegal immigrants from federal laws while Bush was in office. ""The polls just came out, and I'm tied with Jeb Bush. And I said, oh, that's too bad, how can I be tied with this guy? He's terrible. He's terrible. He's weak on immigration,"" Trump said during a speech in Phoenix on July 11, 2015. ""You know, the sanctuary cities, do you know he had five of them in Florida while he was governor? Can you believe this? I didn't know that."" Trump was practically tied with Bush according to a poll released the same day. But more importantly, Trump seized upon an increasingly used talking point in the presidential campaign --  so-called ""sanctuary cities"" that thwart federal immigration law. Bush’s stance on illegal immigration has wavered a bit over the years, but he was known for being in favor of deportation while in the Governor’s Mansion. Did five sanctuary cities exist in Florida during his time in office? Not according to any official metric, but the Internet is a big place. Sanctuary cities There is no specific legal definition of sanctuary cities, but it generally refers to places where local law enforcement officers aren’t required to alert federal authorities to residents who may be in the country illegally. The easiest sanctuary cities to identify are those with formal written policies. The recent shooting death of a San Francisco woman, allegedly by a Mexican native with a criminal record, has sparked a debate over rules like San Francisco’s quarter-century-old law declaring it a ""city and county of refuge."" The San Francisco law generally bans public employees from assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement with investigations or arrests unless required by a law or a warrant. There is an exception for people convicted of felonies. The term appears to have roots in the 1980s, when Central American refugees fled civil wars and were initially denied asylum. Religious institutions banded together to protect the refugees, with some cities expressing solidarity with the ""Sanctuary Movement,"" according to a 2011 paper by the Immigration Policy Council. But before then, starting in the 1970s, some cities started policies banning police from asking about the immigration status of people who hadn’t been arrested. We reached out to Trump’s campaign and didn’t hear back; Bush’s people had no comment, either. So we went in search of lists of sanctuary cities. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service published a 2006 report listing 31 cities and counties that ""will generally promote policies that ensure such aliens will not be turned over to federal authorities."" No Florida cities were included. We also found websites that had put together their own lists, such as a 2007 list created by the Ohio Jobs and Justice PAC. Steve Salvi, the group’s founder, is critical of sanctuary cities and claims to have created the most comprehensive list of its kind. It was most recently updated in July 2015 and includes five Florida locations:  DeLeon Springs; Deltona; Jupiter; Lake Worth, and Miami. Salvi told us that he culled the list by looking at news reports and input from local citizens. The requirements for the list are very loose -- cities could have provided services to illegal immigrants, or have leaders who promoted immigration reform.  We found a few problems with the list. DeLeon Springs isn’t even a town, but part of unincorporated Volusia County. The county sheriff’s department oversees law enforcement there and in Deltona. The Deltona city attorney and the Volusia County Sheriff’s Department both said Deltona had never had such a policy since being incorporated in 1995. Officials in Jupiter and Lake Worth, which Salvi added to the list  in 2009 (after Bush left office), said they aren’t sanctuary cities. Both cities have day-labor centers, which could be why they landed on the list. However, the existence of such centers for illegal immigrants to look for work doesn’t tell us anything about whether police cooperate with immigration authorities. Miami Mayor Tomás Regalado denies that his city is a sanctuary city, either now or when Bush was in office.  ""Do police enforce immigration? No, we never have. .... Officially, we don’t protect immigrants or deliver immigrants (to federal officials),"" Regalado said. Current policies The Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter immigration laws, regularly updates a map on its website detailing sanctuary cities, counties and states. It also lists why a location is included. As of this writing, the map listed seven Florida counties: Broward, Hernando, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Pasco and Pinellas. The center told PolitiFact it based its map on U.S. Department of Homeland Security data from 2014 (years after Bush left office). Under a former program called Secure Communities, Immigration and Customs Enforcement got fingerprints from suspects, and if they had violated immigration laws, the agency asked local authorities to detain them. But some local officials complained that immigrants who were victims of crimes were avoiding the police, so the officials refused to comply with the ICE detainers. The federal agency announced a new more targeted program in November. In Florida, six of seven counties’ sheriff’s departments adopted policies in 2014 to no longer honor those ""detainer"" requests unless there is a legal order to do so. Miami-Dade County stopped complying with the requests a year earlier, in 2013. The Miami-Dade County Commission adopted the policy because the jail had to bear most of the detentions’ cost, and because immigration advocates clamored for the change. Now, arrested illegal immigrants are detained only if they have an outstanding warrant. What could Bush or any governor do to deter sanctuary cities? It seems like the Legislature would have had to have acted, and we didn’t find any action on the matter during Bush’s time.  In 2008, after Bush left office, a bill that would have prevented sanctuary cities in Florida died in the Legislature, when Sen. Marco Rubio was then speaker of the House. The bill would have prohibited statewide any sort of government restrictions on disclosing someone’s immigration status in several scenarios, including employment or issuing public benefits. It also would have required all public employees to work with federal agencies to comply with federal immigration laws. Our ruling Trump said Florida had five sanctuary cities while Bush was governor.  There’s no legal definition of a sanctuary city, and therefore no official classification. A federal report from 2006, when Bush was governor, didn’t name any Florida cities. We found one list on the Internet that claimed five Florida locations as current sanctuary cities, but the supporting evidence was virtually nonexistent. City officials told us they weren’t sure why their cities were on the list. For lack of evidence, we rate Trump’s statement False.",/factchecks/2015/jul/15/donald-trump/trump-says-florida-had-five-sanctuary-cities-when-/

Rachel Maddow says Donald Trump exaggerated his crowd in Phoenix
","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump took his controversial but increasingly popular act to Phoenix, July 11, 2015, drawing a feverish reception among a crowd of Maricopa County Republicans. But just how big was the crowd? The ever-braggadocious Trump described an audience of 10,000 to 15,000 to 20,000 people coming to see him. The reality is the crowd was big, but not that big, as MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow pointed out. ""I mean, no, there weren’t 15,000 people who turned out in Phoenix to see Donald Trump,"" Maddow said on July 13, 2015. ""But there were a few thousand people. That was bigger than the other Republican candidates are getting, in terms of crowd size."" Trump’s own Twitter timeline tells much of the story behind the event, with the rest of the details filled in by journalists’ accounts and our interviews with public officials. The event, hosted by the Maricopa County Republican Party (home to Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the immigration hard-liner who spoke before Trump), was supposed to be at the Arizona Biltmore resort hotel. But with larger-than-expected crowds, the campaign moved the event to the Phoenix Convention Center. Trump was excited about the buzz on the day before his Saturday speech, tweeting, ""Look forward to being in Phoenix tomorrow at 2:00 P.M. Hottest ticket in entire country. Was supposed to be 500 people, now many thousands!"" Media previews of the speech mentioned anywhere from 3,500-9,000 people were planning to come to the speech. As organizers began letting people in, a line wrapped around the convention center. Many people — hard to say how many, though some reports put it around 1,000 — were turned away. Arizona Republic national political reporter Dan Nowicki describes ""bedlam in the ballroom"" as Trump took the stage an hour after the planned start. In between insulting 23 people or things in his speech, as counted by the Washington Post, Trump also remarked about the size of the crowd. According to CNN, Trump said, ""This is unbelievable. This began as 500 people in a ballroom in Phoenix."" He also said the crowd ""blows away"" crowds for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, whose recent crowds are drawing headlines. So how big was Trump’s showing? The Post put the crowd size at 4,200. CNN guessed around 5,000, quoting the Trump campaign as saying 15,000 tickets were distributed. But that’s not what Trump saw. Trump toasted the crowd on his Facebook page that night, writing, ""This is what 15,000 people looks like.""  City officials started pushing back on Trump’s claim. In a statement shared with PunditFact, the city fire department said capacity for the North Ballroom was 4,200 people. The doors were closed at 4,169 attendees, said Phoenix Fire Department spokeswoman Shelly Jamison. ""Once that capacity was reached, we closed the doors,"" she said. ""The Phoenix Convention Center has a fire prevention specialist who is an expert on large events (e.g. Super Bowl Fan Fest, Comicon, etc) assigned specifically to the Phoenix Convention Center to enforce fire code compliance."" Brahm Resnik, a TV reporter with 12 News in Arizona, questioned on Twitter why Trump would exaggerate an already respectable crowd size as he fact-checked Trump’s crowd-size claims in his reports. (Maddow played one of his reports before making her claim on the show.)  Trump did not take kindly to the questions about his crowd size. He doubled down, tweeting July 12, ""Convention Center officials in Phoenix don't want to admit that they broke the fire code by allowing 12-15,000 people in 4,000 code room."" Also: ""Phoenix Convention Center officials did not want to have thousands of people standing outside in the heat, so they let them in. A GREAT day!"" The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. For comparison sake, here is an image of the Bryce Jordan Center, home to Penn State University’s basketball team. Its listed seating capacity is just over 15,000.  And here’s the widest picture of Trump’s Phoenix speech that we could locate. It comes from Charlie Leight of Getty Images.  Our ruling Maddow called out Trump for exaggerating the size of his audience in Phoenix, saying 15,000 people did not attend his speech despite his claim on Facebook to the contrary. News stories and the city fire department back up her point. By many accounts, the crowd size and atmosphere was impressive, but it was about three times smaller than he described.

Hillary Clinton says she called for Wall Street regulations early in the financial crisis
","Hillary Clinton has a reputation for being cozy with Wall Street -- but in her 2016 campaign, she’s been striking populist tones. Clinton introduced her plan for a variety of economic issues in a speech at the New School in Manhattan on July 14, 2015. As president, she said, she would go ""beyond Dodd-Frank"" -- the regulations on financial institutions that took hold in 2010, following the economic crisis of 2007-08. She said she had been calling for financial regulations since the very early stages of the crisis. ""As we all know, in the years before the crash, financial firms piled risk upon risk, and regulators in Washington either couldn’t or wouldn’t keep up,"" she said. ""I was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight."" Clinton used to be the senator from New York, the home of Wall Street. She has a history of campaign backing from the finance industry and of delivering high-priced speeches to finance firms, such as Goldman Sachs. And her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed the repeal of a bank break-up bill, the Glass-Steagall Act -- a deregulation that some critics believe contributed to the financial crisis. So we questioned Hillary Clinton’s record of addressing financial regulations. Did she address derivatives, subprime mortgages and financial oversight so early in the crisis? The 2008 primary campaign While the financial crisis came to a head in summer 2008, problems with housing started to bubble up in 2007 during Clinton’s ill-fated presidential primary campaign. On the trail, Clinton addressed these nascent issues -- particularly the mortgage crisis -- as early as March of that year. Clinton, still a senator at the time, delivered a speech on the volatility of the subprime mortgage market on March 15, 2007. She said too many people were ignoring warning signs. ""The subprime problems are now creating massive issues on Wall Street,"" Clinton said. ""It's a serious problem affecting our housing market and millions of hard-working families."" She gave specific proposals for addressing subprime mortgages, including expanding the role of the Federal Housing Administration, more borrowing options for underprivileged and first-time homebuyers, more safeguards against predatory lending practices and policies intended to prevent foreclosures. In August that year, she delivered a similar speech about dealing with problems from subprime mortgages. There, she reiterated earlier proposals, and also suggested laws establishing national standards and registration for loan brokers, as well as regulations on lenders. ""I think the subprime market was sort of like the canary in the mine,"" she said. ""You know, it was telling us loudly and clearly, ‘There are problems here.’ "" It didn’t become law, but Clinton sponsored a bill to implement these policies in September 2007. The first time she mentioned derivatives was in a November 2007 speech in Iowa.  (A derivative is a financial product that allows investors to hedge against price fluctuations in an underlying asset.) ""We need to start addressing the risks posed by derivatives and other complex financial products,"" she said. ""You can't let Wall Street send the bill to your street with the bright ideas that just don't work out. Derivatives and products like them are posing real risks to families, as Wall Street writes down tens of billions of dollars in investments. Companies are taking the loss of a billion here and a billion there simply because the securities they own are worth less than they thought."" In the same speech, she spoke again of the risky lending that led to the subprime mortgage crisis, adding that she called on then-President George W. Bush to convene a conference to find a solution. And she also pushed for more oversight of financial markets: ""So as president, I will move to establish the 21st-century oversight we need in a 21st-century global marketplace. I will call for an immediate review of these new investment products and for plans to make them more transparent."" This November speech angered some of Clinton’s Wall Street donors, according to the New York Times. At the tail-end of her campaign, in March 2008 -- still before the financial crisis hit a peak later that summer -- Clinton released a six-point plan to increase financial regulation. The plan included, in part, more oversight of derivatives and other new financial products, establishment of mortgage standards and strengthened some consumer protections. After becoming secretary of state in 2009, Clinton made noticeably fewer comments on domestic policy and financial regulation. But the record shows that establishing policies to address the then-nascent financial crisis was a key point of her campaign platform in 2007 and 2008. Our ruling Clinton said she ""called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight"" early on in the financial crisis. The crisis hit a peak in summer 2008, though it started to gain traction in 2007. Clinton began addressing the subprime mortgage issue in her appearances in March 2007. Later that year, she took on derivatives. She also proposed specific plans for solving these problems and increasing oversight of financial institutions.

"['Candidate Biography', 'City Government', 'Education', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says Wisconsin property taxes are lower than they were when he took office
","In announcing his run for president, Gov. Scott Walker made a boast about property taxes that both highlights his record in Wisconsin and contrasts it with other governors who are competing for the Republican nomination. ""We lowered taxes on individuals, on employers and property owners,"" Walker said a few minutes into the July 13, 2015 speech (fact-checked here). ""Property taxes today are lower than they were four years ago. ""How many other governors can say that?"" Walker made the property tax claim again the next day in Nevada and it seemed destined to become a talking point in South Carolina, Georgia, New Hampshire and Iowa as he made his first campaign swing as an announced candidate. Implicit in Walker’s statement is that not only are property taxes down, but they are lower as a result of his actions. So let’s see if that’s accurate. An earlier claim Walker made a similar claim during his State of the State speech in January 2014. He said that because of ""tax controls"" he and the GOP-run Legislature had put in place, property taxes on a typical home in 2014 would be lower than in 2010, which was the year before he took office. We found the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau had projected that the 2014 property tax bill for a median-valued home taxed at the statewide average property tax rate would be $2,954. That was $9 lower than in 2010. (Actual tax bills weren't sent out until December 2014.) The fiscal bureau regularly does such estimates, and they are routinely cited by politicians of both stripes. But it’s important to note they are an illustration -- some people's property taxes went down, some went up. Even if your home value was right at that statewide average, your tax bill might have been higher due to various factors, including levies in individual communities. In the earlier fact check, we found that tax and spending restraints Republicans put on local governments and schools were crucial in the decrease in the hypothetical tax bill, but that a drop in home values also played a role. We rated that claim Mostly True. So, Walker's earlier claim was based on a projected figure for 2014. We now have the tax collection numbers for 2014, as well as fiscal bureau projections for 2015 and 2016. New claim -- one measure In Wisconsin, according to the fiscal bureau, local governments rely on property tax revenue more than the U.S. average. And in comparison to other states, Wisconsin property taxes have been among the highest in the nation since at least 1970 (ranking 13th in 2012). We went to the fiscal bureau’s latest tally of the estimated property tax bills, which was produced in May 2015. Tax year Estimated property tax bill for a median-valued home 2010 $2,963 2011 (Walker takes office) $2,953 2012 $2,943 2013 $2,926 2014 $2,832 2015 (projected) $2,824 2016 (projected) $2,821 So, there have been four straight years of declines in the hypothetical example during Walker's first four years in office. (The projections for 2015 and 2016 indicate it will be six straight years). The 2014 bill -- the most recent year for which property tax bills have been issued -- was $131 lower than in 2010. That’s more than the $9 reduction that had been projected when we last looked at this topic. As we noted in the earlier fact check, while the decreases are modest, they represent a significant turnaround. From 2006 to 2010, the typical bill increased by $230. But there are other ways to evaluate Walker’s claim. Other measures The nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance provided us net property tax levies (the amount of property taxes levied after all credits were provided), as well the net levies as expressed as a percentage of personal income; the percentage is sometimes referred to as the tax burden.   Tax year Net property tax levy Net property tax levy as percentage of personal income 2010 $9.34 billion 4.24% 2011 (Walker takes office) $9.35 billion 4.02% 2012 $9.43 billion 3.88% 2013 $9.54 billion 3.84% 2014 $9.32 billion 3.63% The figures show that although the net property tax levy increased during each of Walker’s first three years in office, it dropped in 2014 to lower than it was four years earlier. And considering net property tax levy as a percentage of personal income, the rate in 2014 was lower than in each of the previous four years. The alliance told us that the 3.63 percent figure for 2014 is the lowest since 1946. The reasons As we found in our earlier fact check, the main reason property taxes are down is the limits Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature put on school districts and other local governments to levy taxes. Since then, in 2014, the Republicans boosted state aid to technical colleges by $406 million, resulting in the schools reducing their property tax levies by the same amount. At the same time, housing values continue to be a factor in holding down property taxes. The fiscal bureau has noted that housing values statewide, after declining from 2009 through 2013, rose by 1.7 percent in 2014. But the recovery in the housing market isn’t complete. Our rating Walker said that because of his actions, Wisconsin ""property taxes today are lower than they were four years ago."" Measured three different ways, the statistical part of the claim is numerically accurate. And Walker’s measures to limit local property tax increases have played a major role. But the lower taxes are due in part to declines in housing values that have only partially recovered. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True.   More on Scott Walker Go here for an in-depth look at Walker’s record on the Truth-O-Meter and the Flip-O-Meter.

Can a cat run for president?
","Editor’s note, July 15, 2015, 10:50 a.m.: After we published this report, we received additional details from the Federal Election Commission that may prove a devastating blow to Limberbutt’s fledging candidacy. According to the FEC, Limberbutt must raise or spend $5,000 to be considered an official candidate by the commission. We’ve added that new information to this fact-check. Limberbutt McCubbins is running for president, and the five-year-old feline isn’t pussyfooting around. Besides launching a campaign website and accompanying social media accounts, Limberbutt has caught some media attention (though some seem unaware of his animal nature), nabbed an endorsement, and even inspired a line of campaign swag. ""Limberbutt McCubbins is a candidate we can all get behind! Meow is the time!"" the kitty’s website announces. After thousands of fact-checks devoted to policy issues and the major presidential candidates, we thought it would be fun to look into how far this candidacy has gone and how far it can go. Registering with the FEC  At the time of this report, Limberbutt and 477 others have submitted a statement of candidacy to the Federal Election Commission. So far, the cat has followed all the rules of the election process. Virtually anyone can file the paperwork but only those who have spent or received $5,000 on their campaigns are considered official candidates, an FEC spokesperson told us. These regulations, however, say that they apply to ""individuals,"" not animals. High schooler Isaac Weiss, a friend of Limberbutt’s owner Emilee McCubbins, filed the cat’s statement of candidacy on May 6, 2015. Limberbutt’s a Democrat, and Weiss registered his campaign organization, ""The Committee for the Installation of Limberbutt,"" on the same day. ""It only took us about 20 minutes to fill out the forms, which surprised us,"" Weiss told the Miami Herald. ""And it surprised us even more that nobody from the FEC got back to us about Limberbutt being a cat after reporters started doing stories."" The FEC is not responsible for checking out a would-be  candidate’s qualifications, according to the spokesperson. (We’ll get to this later.) Limberbutt has yet to file the mandatory quarterly report disclosing his receipts and disbursements (neither has Donald Trump). But the form isn’t due until July 15, so ""there’s still time,"" Weiss told PolitiFact. Constitutional requirements Even if Limberbutt complies with election regulations, the question of his eligibility looms. For one, he’s only 5 years old, 30 years too young to run for president. Weiss, for his part, is confident Limberbutt faces no legal hurdles in his bid, claiming that Limberbutt is 36 in cat years. ""The Constitution doesn't say it has to be human years,"" he told the Herald.   Unfortunately for Weiss, we found no reliable scientific method for converting cat years into human years nor legal framework allowing the practice. Article II of the Constitution states that ""no person"" under age 35 who’s not a natural-born citizen can be president. (We’ve looked into the eligibility of Ted Cruz, who was born in Canada.) Does that mean cats are exempt from the age requirement? Probably not, said Michael Gilbert, a professor of election law at the University of Virginia. ""In jest, the expression of one thing (persons must meet certain requirements to be president) implies the exclusion of all others (nonpersons don’t have to meet any requirements to be president) — an underage Pakistani cat could win in 2016,"" Gilbert said. In seriousness, Gilbert is ""quite sure that any court that considers the matter will interpret the Constitution to require federal officeholders to be human beings."" Constitutional law scholar Sarah Duggin of Catholic University pointed out several other issues with Limberbutt’s candidacy in the text: The 14th Amendment restricts citizenship to human beings; the 25th Amendment stipulates he must be able to discharge his powers and duties to a vice president; and, if Limberbutt is elected, the 20th Amendment gives Congress the burden of handling a situation where ""the president-elect shall have failed to qualify."" ""I suspect that there might also be a strong case for arguing that cats are aliens, and it's very hard to argue that cats are subject to anyone's jurisdiction -- just kidding,"" she added. In sum, Limberbutt fails to meet the constitutional requirements. Ballot access Historically, at least 33 unqualified candidates have made it onto ballots, experts told us. The requirements for getting your name listed vary from state to state and from the party primaries to the general election. ""It’ll be harder to get on the primary ballot than on the general,"" said Richard Winger, publisher and editor of Ballot Access News. That’s because primary ballots often require would-be candidates to sign a written declaration that they meet the constitutional requirements and/or they are a registered member of the party. General election ballots are often more lax -- some require a few thousand signatures, and others a filing fee. The most crowded presidential ballot (16 candidates) was Colorado’s in 2012, said Winger. He noted that in 1972, the Socialist Workers Party’s underage slate appeared on 20 state ballots. More than 3,000 voters in six states cast ballots for the party’s 2004 presidential candidate, who was a citizen of Nicaragua. If Limberbutt re-declared as a third-party candidate in the general election, he would need 5,000 signatures to appear on the ballot in his homestate of Kentucky. Weiss, the cat’s campaign manager, told us he needs to meet with other members of the organizing committee when the school year starts to determine if they’ll pursue that option.  Even if he gets the support, Winger doubts if the Bluegrass State will permit voters to choose Limberbutt in November 2016, and ""no court would make them do it."" Political animals Limberbutt’s not the first non-human candidate to run for office. In a few local and international elections, some animals have even won. Limberbutt’s most famous predecessor was a boar hog named Pigasus the Immortal, the Youth International Party’s 1968 presidential candidate. Its slogan: ""They nominate a president, and he eats the people. We nominate a president, and the people eat him."" ""Pigasus was definitely satire and fun, and incredible street theater, but there was also a political message of course,"" said Katherine Sibley, who studies social movements at St. Joseph’s University. ""They wanted to show the police, those at the convention, protesters in Chicago and Americans at large, that things had gotten pretty insane and violent in America."" No efforts were made to get Pigasus on a ballot that year, as he and supporters were arrested at the Democratic Convention in Chicago. The charges were dropped, and the pig dropped off the radar. Rumors that he had become a meal for the Chicago police have never been confirmed, said Sibley. Limberbutt’s candidacy, meanwhile, was inspired by a more passive form of youth revolt. Weiss and his friends registered the cat after being bored by ""what seemed to them like about the umptheenth (presidential) announcement,"" reports the Herald. Can Limberbutt claw his way to the White House politically? On one hand, he’s effectively polling at the same rate as Democratic rival Lincoln Chafee, and there’s some speculation Bernie Sanders could pick him as a running mate. On the other, we still haven’t heard anything about his economic pawlicy. Our ruling McCubbins, a five-year-old cat, said, ""Limberbutt McCubbins is a candidate"" in the 2016 presidential election. Yes, this is the first time we're fact-checking a claim made by a cat. (Though we have fact-checked a terrier who supported Mitt Romney in 2008.) Limberbutt’s campaign manager has filed official paperwork, but the FEC doesn’t deem him formally a candidate, because he hasn’t spent or received $5,000. (This is also the case for some human candidates.) Experts told us it’s very unlikely that he’ll appear on any ballots as a candidate, and it’s even more unlikely that his candidacy will stand in a court of law.

Donald Trump says the '$5 billion website for Obamacare … never worked. Still doesn't work'
","Donald Trump, the celebrity businessman who has shaken up the Republican presidential race, has been attacking both Republicans and Democrats in his speeches and interviews. At one point in a July 11, 2015, speech in Phoenix, he took aim at the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. He singled out the healthcare.gov website, which was unveiled in the fall of 2013 with a panoply of bugs and glitches, calling it ""the $5 billion website for Obamacare, which never worked. Still doesn't work."" It’s a year and a half after the website’s troubled launch, and it’s been awhile since we’ve taken a look at how the website is doing and what it has cost to build. So we decided to see if Trump has any basis either for saying that the healthcare.gov website cost $5 billion or that it ""still doesn’t work."" (Trump’s camp didn’t respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact.) Let’s take each of these claims in turn. Did the website cost $5 billion? The cost of the website has been a bone of contention ever since its launch, partly because federal contracting is complex, involving some 60 major contracts. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker grappled with this question over the course of two separate reports that included several interim updates as new data surfaced. Officially, the Department of Health and Human Services says the website cost $834 million. That’s the number offered by then-HHS Secretary-designate Sylvia Mathews Burwell at a Senate hearing on May 8, 2014. As of Feb. 28, 2014, Burwell told lawmakers, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- the part of HHS responsible for the website -- ""has obligated a total of approximately $834 million on marketplace-related (information technology) contracts and interagency agreements."" Not everyone has taken that figure at face value. Bloomberg Government undertook a study that used a more generous definition of the relevant federal spending. In the study, released in September 2014, researchers included several additional costs beyond the government’s official estimate -- $387 million in spending by the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies beyond HHS, as well as a $300 million contract to process paper applications, and additional spending by HHS after the cutoff for Burwell’s estimate. Using this broader net, Bloomberg Government came up with a figure of $2.1 billion. That’s bigger than the official estimate, but it’s still not as large as what Trump said. We asked the Bloomberg Government study’s author, Peter Gosselin, whether he thought the number could have more than doubled to $5 billion since the study was released 10 months ago. He was skeptical, saying that even if you add on a five-year follow-up contract with the firm Accenture, it should ""only get you about halfway to $5 billion."" So Trump’s figure seems exaggerated. However, we have a hunch about where it came from, and while it’s wrong, it’s easy to see how someone could have made the mistake. Using a provision of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government has spent nearly $5 billion in a series of grants to states to establish health care exchanges, according to tabulations made by both the Congressional Research Service and the Kaiser Family Foundation. This $5 billion statistic was widely reported and pops up easily during Google searches. This would seem to suggest that the government had spent $5 billion on healthcare.gov. But that’s not quite correct, experts told PolitiFact. Rather, these grants were designed to boost state efforts under the law -- not the federal site -- and paid for a wide variety of things other than websites, including helping insurers prepare to join the exchanges, offering assistance through telephone hotlines, establishing marketing and outreach efforts for potential beneficiaries, and hiring ""navigators"" who help beneficiaries obtain care. Both Gosselin and Jennifer Tolbert, the director of state health reform at the Kaiser Family Foundation, agreed that it would be incorrect to simply assume that the $5 billion in health insurance exchange grants is tantamount to spending on the website in the way Trump expressed it. ""It’s a different pot of money,"" Tolbert said. ""It’s entirely separate from the money used to build the healthcare.gov website."" Is it true that healthcare.gov 'still doesn’t work'? This part of Trump’s claim is easier to debunk. The proof is in the millions of Americans who have used the healthcare.gov website to obtain insurance coverage. According to the most recent data released by HHS, covering the open-enrollment period between November 2014 to February 2015, a total of 11.7 million Americans selected or were automatically enrolled in an insurance plan for 2015 using the online marketplaces. Of that, 8.84 million signed up through the federal marketplace -- healthcare.gov -- with the remainder signing up through state-run websites. (These figures are not limited to those who have already made their first premium payment.) So, clearly, the site is working. This isn’t to say the system is working 100 percent perfectly. ""There are some remaining issues, especially for certain populations, such as immigrants and people for whom it's difficult to verify their identity or income using electronic data,"" Tolbert said. ""This can include people who have not been in the country very long or who haven’t yet worked long enough to establish a work and income history."" Still, the site appears to be functioning well in most cases. ""Since the troublesome launch of healthcare.gov, (the government) has taken various actions to address the problems that impeded the initial use of the website and its supporting systems,"" the Government Accountability Office, Congress’ investigative arm, concluded in a March 2015 report. ""Operationally, the website works for the most part,"" said Tolbert of Kaiser. ""It’s in much better shape than it was during the first few months of open enrollment."" Our ruling Trump said ""the $5 billion website for Obamacare … never worked. Still doesn't work."" But experts say that, using the most reasonable definitions, Trump overstates the amount of money spent to create and fix healthcare.gov, and his claim that the website isn’t working -- and never did -- is debunked by the fact that millions of Americans have signed up for insurance through the site, even if some more limited glitches remain.

Former NFL QB Joe Theismann: 'We don't have a reserve'
","Former NFL quarterback Joe Theismann recently joined the all-female cast of Fox News’ Outnumbered to offer his perspective on recent news, from a federal judge ordering the logo of his former team to be canceled to the slaying of a San Francisco woman that sparked fresh debate about this country’s immigration policy. Theismann called the murder of Kathryn Steinle, 32, a tragedy and bemoaned the porous borders that allow undocumented immigrants to access the country, including the alleged killer, a Mexican felon who had been deported five times named Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez. After criticizing Donald Trump’s proposal to build a wall on the border as an unrealistic fix, Theismann warned that budget cuts to the military are making the already chaotic environment worse. ""Our border patrol is spread out so thin that people just walk through, they don’t even know they’re there,"" Theismann said during the July 9 episode. ""We’re faced with a situation now where you talk about National Guardsmen going down there. We’re about to cut the military by 40,000 people, which is another subject. We went from 500,000 down to 400,000. ""We don’t have a reserve force if something happens."" The retired quarterback who later had a long career as a sports broadcaster threw out a slew of facts, but the last one sounded the most alarming. Are U.S. leaders really sacrificing the military reserve as they whip the country into top fiscal shape? No — a fact Theismann acknowledged during a phone call with PunditFact. Theismann said he was trying to highlight cuts to the military that are, in fact, happening due to automatic federal spending cuts known as sequestration. But he took it too far. ""With all the things that are happening in the world, especially in the Middle East right now, if we ever felt like we needed to get our ground forces involved, what position would we be in to deal with any difficult situation that could come up anywhere in the world?"" Theismann told us. ""Because I still believe that we should be the world power and by continuing to cut the military, I think we diminish the ability to be the biggest stick in the valley."" ""That was what I was trying to say in a short period,"" Theismann said. America’s reserve military forces include both the reserves and the National Guard. People may use the terms interchangeably, but they are different. National Guard units are jointly controlled by both state governors and the president and often respond to state-level emergencies, including riots, hurricanes and other disasters. Full reserves fall under the control of the president and the branch of the military in which they serve. Theismann clarified that he was talking about the Army Reserve, not the Army National Guard or other components of the National Guard. While it’s important to have your vocabulary correct, it doesn’t really affect the accuracy of Theismann’s claim either way. Both the National Guard and reserves expect cuts. But both will most definitely continue. The Army National Guard is scheduled to shed 15,000 soldiers by Sept. 30, 2017, as part of sequestration. This will bring the Army National Guard to 335,000 soldiers — down from its current size of 350,000. The Air National Guard will not lose positions due to sequestration, said National Guard spokesman Kurt M. Rauschenberg. The Army Reserve also expects to lose positions. On July 9, coincidentally the same day as this episode of Outnumbered, the U.S. Army announced how it would go about budget cuts that would affect active and reserve military. The Army Reserve said its force would drop to 185,000 if sequestration continues through the 2017 fiscal year, part of an overall cut of 60,000 soldiers. The active military could fall to 450,000 soldiers by the end of fiscal year 2018, down from 570,000 in 2012 after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Under the current plan for cuts, the overall Army would drop from 1,042,200 soldiers to 980,000, a total that includes active-duty Army (full-time), Army National Guard (part-time, can be activated to respond to state emergencies) and Army Reserve (part-time branch of the Army). Army Reserve employees would fall from 202,000 soldiers to 195,000 by the end of the 2017 fiscal year. ""I believe that where we are now is about as low as we can go,"" Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno told reporters in a May conference call, according to Army Times. ""If we continue to go lower, we're going to have to say we cannot do all the things we're doing today."" Our ruling Warning of a shorthanded military amid a border crisis, Theismann said, ""We don’t have a reserve force if something happens."" Theismann later admitted he didn’t choose his words very carefully. Automatic federal cuts as part of sequestration are shrinking the military. Leaders have warned that cuts could reduce the Army’s ability to respond to crises. But the Army Reserve, which Theismann says he was talking about, very much remains in existence. The Reserve would be available, along with the National Guard, to assist the border patrol or active military in emergencies.

"['Congress', 'Florida', 'Alan Grayson']","
Alan Grayson says he passed more bills and amendments than any other current member
","Though U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, is perhaps most famous for his colorful language about Republicans, in his campaign for U.S. Senate he wants to portray himself as a politician who gets things done -- even when Republicans are in charge of Congress. On July 9, Grayson announced that he will take on fellow Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy of Jupiter for the seat being vacated by U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. Grayson repeatedly made claims that he is No. 1 in terms of legislation passed: ""In the past two years in Congress, I’ve written more bills, passed more amendments on the floor of the House and enacted more of my bills into law than any other member of the House -- No. 1 out of 435 of us,"" Grayson said in an announcement video on senatorwithguts.com. Is Grayson No. 1 in introducing bills as well as passing bills and amendments? Introducing bills This part of Grayson’s claim is straightforward: For the most recent, Congress he holds the record for introducing bills. GovTrack, a website which tracks legislation, found that Grayson introduced 96 bills and resolutions during the 113th Congress, a two-year term which ended in January. That placed him at the No. 1 spot. But how many passed? That might sound straightforward, but it isn’t. Passing bills As we have noted before, the number of bills sponsored by a member doesn’t tell the full story about any member’s legislative accomplishments. They can also influence legislation in other ways, such as writing language that gets included in a separate bill, co-sponsoring bills, holding hearings and negotiating agreements. One way to count how many bills a member passed is to look at the number of bills he sponsored and how many of those actual bills were signed into law. Using that method, GovTrack found that zero of Grayson’s bills became law during the 113th Congress. But Grayson counts bills that he sponsored in which the same language was included in separate versions. Using the Congress.gov website, Grayson campaign spokesman Kevin Franck, pointed to 281 pieces of legislation that passed during the 113th Congress. The website showed that Grayson sponsored 10, more than anyone else. But none of those 10 were the actual ones that passed -- instead, other versions passed. And nine of those were ultimately lumped into one bill to amend the IRS tax code to extend tax credits -- for example for energy efficient homes -- or a deduction. The House passed H.R. 5771 378-46 in December 2014. ""My hunch is that these provisions would have made their way into the tax extender bill even without Rep. Grayson's bills,"" George Washington University professor Sarah Binder said.   The only bill that didn’t fall into that category was to prohibit an increase in the number of the military's flag and general officers -- the version that passed the House passed 376-5. (Grayson’s staff found two additional bills he passed that didn’t show up in that list of 10 that were lumped into a defense bill at the end of the year.) So are these all meaty bills? Not really. ""But sometimes the little stuff matters a lot,"" Binder said. ""And we expect our representatives to care about parochial issues as well. So it strikes me as reasonable when lawmakers take credit for a range of types of issues, whether or not they make the front pages."" Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said that measuring productivity by the number of bills passed is tricky. ""Even writing minor, technical, or routine bills is not the same as participating in crafting major legislation. To give him his due, not very many major bills have passed in recent congresses, but still ... Inflated claim,"" he said. Amendments A similar search of the Congress.gov website showed that Grayson, as well as U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., tied for first with 21 amendments. Grayson’s amendments covered a range of topics, including funding for the search for a cure for Gulf War illness, for gun locks, and for tax counseling for the elderly. Eight of the amendments aimed to prevent the award of federal contracts to principals convicted of various crimes or who had civil judgments against them. (The passed amendments in his list of 21 doesn’t include about a dozen en-bloc amendments, in which a chairman groups together a bunch of amendments at once.)   With the exception of one of the 21 amendments, all of them passed by voice votes suggesting they were not controversial. (The one that reached a vote was to protect journalists from testifying about confidential sources. The amendment passed 225-183 but didn’t make it into the final legislation. Grayson has reintroduced it.) ""That said, there are a handful of Grayson amendments that secure recorded votes and then fail, so his floor track record is a bit uneven -- as we might expect for a minority party member,"" Binder said. For example in June 2013, he had two amendments narrowly fail -- one by one vote, the other by a tie -- on bills related to expanding oil and gas production. His amendment aimed to protect the authority of states to restrict oil drilling off their waters. Ultimately, the vast majority of Grayson amendments that passed did not end up in the final version of bills that became law.  One of the 21 amendments and three of the en bloc amendments made it into law, according to Grayson’s office. It seems to be Grayson’s strategy to try to pass as many as possible since he re-joined Congress in 2012. In June, he passed five in one day. ""Grayson and his staff scan the bills that come out of the majority,"" wrote David Weigel in Slate in 2013. ""They scan amendments that passed in previous Congresses but died at some point along the way. They resurrect or mold bills that can appeal to the libertarian streak in the GOP, and Grayson lobbies his colleagues personally."" Based on our research, it seems like Grayson has worked very hard to pass legislation even though he is in the minority. Another way to look at it is that Grayson is simply  trying to get his name on as many bills or amendments as possible. It’s up to voters to decide how they feel about that. Our ruling Grayson said, ""In the past two years in Congress, I’ve written more bills, passed more amendments on the floor of the House and enacted more of my bills into law than any other member of the House."" It’s true that Grayson is No. 1 in writing bills and resolutions, with 96 in total for the 113th Congress. But Grayson omits some caveats. The 10 bills he sponsored ended up passing as part of other bills, not as stand-alone measures. Of those 10, all but one ultimately landed in the same bill that passed with a fairly wide margin. He had 21 amendments pass, largely on voice votes, which suggests they were not controversial matters. Congressional experts say that the sheer number of bills or amendments written and passed doesn’t tell the full story of a member’s accomplishments. His statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/14/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-he-holds-record-passing-bills-an/

Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer: Only 1 in 4 people trying to cross border are stopped or apprehended
","Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer came to the defense of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, suggesting Trump’s controversial claims about illegal immigrants bringing ""crime"" and being ""rapists"" aren’t necessarily off the mark. Brewer, who championed tough immigration laws in Arizona, said on CNN that studies and research showing no distinguishable rise in crime among illegal immigrants are wrong. ""I find it interesting that people … 1,000 miles away can rely on whatever statistics they want to rely on,"" Brewer said. ""But if you come to Arizona and you talk to people that live on the border, you talk to people that live in Arizona, you will find that, you know, the facts are not true. ""We know from their data, from the federal data, that they (border patrols) only stop or apprehend one out of four illegal people crossing our border,"" Brewer said. PunditFact decided to find out if this fact istrue. We reached out to Brewer to see if she could provide us with the ""federal data"" she was looking at, and also to clarify what she meant by ""our"" border -- did she mean the Arizona border, the border states, or the entire U.S. border? But we did not hear back. In the absence of an answer from Brewer, PunditFact looked around for available federal data that could support Brewer’s claim. First, we mapped out all U.S. Border Patrol sectors. The majority, of course, are found along the Southwest border of the United States. According to 2014 data from the U.S. Border Patrol, this area was responsible for about 98.5 percent of all apprehensions. A similar breakdown is evident in previous years as well. In total, there were 479,371 apprehensions were made along the Southwest border in 2014. According to Brewer, that means about 1.4 million illegal immigrants weren’t stopped and were able to cross into the country. Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at the Pew Research Center, found that number high.   "" ‘Conventional wisdom’ (in the 1980s-1990s) used to be that 1 in 3 was caught,"" Passel said. ""Since then, the Border Patrol has increased significantly; there are miles and miles of fences; substantial technology has been deployed. It seems unreasonable to think that they apprehend a smaller fraction."" And even still, the 1 in 3 figure was at best a rough estimate, Passel said. The government did not seem to keep a record of the effectiveness of Border Patrol apprehensions in the 1980s and 1990s, and since then, that trend has only mildly improved. The recent data The most recent data PunditFact could find dated back to 2011 and included a lot of caveats. The U.S. Government Accountability Office published data about the effectiveness of the Border Patrol at various stations in the Southwest sector from 2006-11. The government measures ""apprehensions,"" ""turn backs"" and ""got aways."" Here is a chart printed by the Washington Post that summarizes that data:  In short, according to the Government Accountability Office, 84 percent of people trying to cross the Southwestern border in FY 2011 were either apprehended or ran back to Mexico. Only 16 percent ""got away,"" meaning they presumably made it into the United States. You can go through the numbers for yourself in more detail, but in no way do they support the idea that three in four illegal immigrants crossing the border makes it to the United States. It’s no better if you specifically focus on Brewer’s home state of Arizona. Looking at sectors covering the Arizona border (Tucson and Yuma), patrols apprehended 64 percent and 74 percent of border crossers respectively. In both cases, another 20 percent of people turned back to Mexico -- meaning only between 6 and 13 percent of people made it across the border successfully. Limits of the data Obviously, counting the number of people who managed to avoid detection is a tricky business. According to the 2012 GAO report, ""indications of illegal crossings are obtained through various sources such as direct agent observation, referrals from credible sources (such as residents), camera monitoring, and detection of physical evidence left on the environment from animal or human crossings."" The ""detection of physical evidence left on the environment"" is known as ""sign-cutting."" It includes searching for evidence such as ""dusty footprints, torn cobwebs, broken twigs, (and) overturned pebbles."" Of the 85,467 people who ""got away"" across the Southwest border in 2011, about 83 percent of them were identified using ""sign-cutting."" The accuracy of ""sign-cutting"" is debated. In one 2013 article published in the Huffington Post, Border Patrol Chief Mike Fisher said that sign-cutting ""is not an exact science."" On the other hand, Border Patrol agent Richard Gordon, who uses sign-cutting frequently, appears to trust the method. ""It's tried, and it's true, and it works,"" said Gordon in the same article. Both ""turn backs"" and ""got aways"" use sign-cutting as a source of information. Another problem with the numbers may be caused by data overlap. According to the 2012 GAO report, sometimes there could be ""cases where the same turn back (or ""got away"") identified by a camera is also identified by sign-cutting. Double counting may also occur when agents in one zone record as a got away an individual who is (later) apprehended and then reported as an apprehension in another zone."" Because of this, ""Border Patrol headquarters officials said that while they consider turn back and got away data sufficiently reliable to assess each sector’s progress toward border security … they do not consider the data sufficiently reliable to compare -- or externally report -- results across sectors."" Border Patrol agents also seem to disagree about some of the published statistics. ""Ask any line agent in the field and he or she will tell you that at best we apprehend 35-40 percent of the illegal immigrants attempting to cross,"" said Border Patrol agent Chris Cabrera in a Breitbart.com article. Our ruling Brewer said that, based on federal data, ""they only stop or apprehend one out of four illegal people crossing our border."" The federal data doesn’t support that. According to the Government Accountability Office, 61 percent of people trying to cross the Southwestern border in FY 2011 (the last year available) were apprehended and another 23 percent were stopped and ran back to Mexico. Only 16 percent ""got away,"" meaning they presumably made it into the United States. It’s obviously hard to know the real numbers with certainty given the nature of the topic, but Brewer erroneously pointed to federal data that does not back her up. We rate her claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/jul/14/jan-brewer/former-arizona-gov-jan-brewer-only-1-4-people-tryi/

Cobb official says Braves stadium awards $250 million in contracts
","The Atlanta Braves are to play baseball by 2017 in a new stadium located, to the chagrin of some, outside the heart of the Capital City and in Cobb County. Cobb County government plans to sell a maximum of $397 million in taxpayer-backed bonds for the stadium Of that money, $368 million goes to construction of the overall stadium project, which is forecast to cost $672 million. The rest is earmarked to cover financing costs and about a year’s worth of interest payments on the debt. Three Cobb County residents went to court to try to block the bonds sale, but the Georgia Supreme Court ruled against them on June 29. A day after the ruling, Cobb County Commission Chairman Tim Lee sent an email blast to constituents, saying ""the high court’s unanimous decision is another step in the right direction"" and ""paves the way for progress as we prepare for Opening Day in 2017."" Construction of the stadium is well under way and has already resulted in more than $250 million worth of contracts to Cobb County businesses, Lee said. It’s hardly a surprise that Lee’s pitching the upsides. What politician wouldn’t, or hasn’t on a project likely to be his legacy? But Is he right on the numbers? PolitiFact decided to check. We contacted Kellie Anne Brownlow, Lee’s deputy chief, asking as we do on all fact-checks, for evidence supporting the chairman’s statement. Brownlow said Lee and members of the county commission don’t deal directly with contracts on the stadium. They are leaving that to the Braves and American Builder 2017 of Kennesaw, a team of four companies that, combined, have built 330-plus sports venues and is in charge of building Cobb’s SunTrust Park. But county commissioners are provided regular updates, and Lee’s statement was pulled straight from details from a recent briefing, Brownlow said. She sent us to an archived video of a May 26 commission meeting in which County Manager David Hankerson announced that $375 million worth of contracts had been awarded, 68 percent  to Cobb County firms. By our calculations, that’s $255 million to the home team. But details are fuel for the fact-checker just as beer and peanuts help keep the Braves faithful waving, chopping and cheering for nine innings. We had to know more. What companies have been awarded these contracts? Where are they located? What work are they under contract to perform? What kind of money is coming their way? Here’s the bottom line of what our research turned up: contracts awarded to Cobb County businesses currently total about $270 million, according to data we reviewed. The largest amount to one company has been $102.7 million to American Builder 2017. One of the smallest contracts, for $20,874, won’t be executed for quite some time. It’s for one of the finishing touches: window treatments for the stadium’s executive offices, VIP seating areas. So Lee’s statement is correct, but with caveats. The $270 million in contracts aren’t exclusively for construction of the 41,500-seat stadium. Chris Britton, project director for American Builders 2017, confirmed that some of the contracts cover work on the mixed-use portion of the project, which Lee and others say should make the overall ballpark site a 365-day-a-year draw. (Restaurants, entertainment venues and a boutique hotel are all in the plans.) If you look at just on the stadium (site prep costs included), the value of the contracts issued to Cobb County firms is $220.5 million. (We were provided a document showing contracts worth $226.8 million. We disqualified a $6.3 million landscape contract that we confirmed had not yet awarded.) We did Google searches to confirm that all of the firms receiving these contracts have locations in Cobb. But from their websites, it was apparent that not all are headquartered in Cobb, raising  the question: How much of what these companies are paid is staying in Cobb or metro Atlanta? For example, three of the four companies partnering as American Builders 2017 are headquartered elsewhere and have other offices around the country: Brasfield & Gorrie is based in Birmingham, Ala; Barton Malow Co. in Southfield, Michigan; and Mortenson Construction, Minneapolis, Minn. (The fourth company in the joint venture American Builders 2017, New South Construction Co., is headquartered in downtown Atlanta.) A $3.5 million contract for shoring and earth-moving work was awarded to Schnabel Foundation Co. The company has its corporate offices is Sterling Va. and regional offices in Marietta and across the U.S. Salaries for on-site workers and supplies are contractors’ biggest expenses and put money into the local economy. But the profits they make from the job  -- which are not disclosed -- go to the headquarters or parent company. Our ruling County Commission Chairman Tim Lee said construction of SunTrust Park, the future home of the Atlanta Braves, has already resulted in the award of more than $250 million worth of contracts to Cobb County firms. He based that on a project update the county commission received in May -- and the math from that showed $255 million in contracts. We looked at detailed reports supplied to us by the county and the projection management team. Those reports show the firms have been awarded $270 million worth of contracts for site prep, the stadium and the adjoining mixed use development. On just the stadium, the contracts are valued at $220.5 million. Lee’s right on the overarching point that the stadium project is generating contracts worth millions to businesses with offices in Cobb County. But there’s added perspective that’s needed. Some of these companies are headquartered in other states, a reality on a mammoth project and in a global economy. But to say they are Cobb County businesses is like saying the Wells Fargo down the street is local. You could argue it is and it isn’t. That can change the bottom line. We rated Lee’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/14/tim-lee/cobb-official-says-braves-stadium-awards-250-milli/

Did Chris Christie veto equal pay for women, as Ultraviolet says?
","As part of a message that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is hostile to women’s issues, a political group claimed that he vetoed legislation that was intended to give women equal pay. Ultraviolet, a women’s rights group, posted an image on Facebook on June 30, 2015, titled ""4 facts about Chris Christie."" The second item read, ""Vetoed equal pay for women 3 times. He only let the bill pass once it became a damaging campaign issue.""  We checked into all four of the claims listed on the image and found this one was misleading and only gives half the story. (Read our story on the rest here.) The bills In September 2012, the New Jersey Legislature passed four bills designed to narrow the gender pay gap. Christie signed one of the bills, gave one an absolute veto, and the other two conditional vetoes. Here is a breakdown of each bill and Christie’s actions: • A-2647: Mandated a statewide requirement for employers to notify employees of the right to be free from benefits and pay discrimination. This bill was signed by Christie. • A-2649: This bill called for government contractors to report employee gender and compensation information to the New Jersey Department of Labor. It got an absolute veto from Christie, who said of the bill, ""These new reporting requirements fail to advance sound policy over senseless bureaucracy."" • A-2648: This bill extended protections for employees who reveal discriminatory actions in their workplaces. Christie conditionally vetoed this bill, saying in his veto message that he would pass it if the Legislature would ""incorporate it into LAD (New Jersey Law Against Discrimination Act)."" It was eventually signed by Christie in August 2013 after his recommended changes were made. • A-2650: This bill would have granted back pay to victims of pay discrimination and was modeled on the federal Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. It also was conditionally vetoed by Christie, but it was never revived. Despite initially vetoing three bills intended to narrow the wage gap by increasing transparency and protections against discriminatory practices, two of the four bills in the legislative package sent to Christie were eventually signed. The timing of the signing Ultraviolet’s claim that Christie only passed one of the bills, A-2648, once it became a ""damaging campaign issue,"" is inaccurate. The timing of the bill’s signing in August 2013, just before the Nov. 5, 2013, gubernatorial election, seems to be coincidental at best. Christie spokesman Brian Murray noted that Christie offered his recommendations through a conditional veto almost a year before his re-election. ""He has absolutely no control over when the legislative branch, controlled in both houses by Democrat majorities, may choose to adopt his recommendations,"" Murray said.   Also, the New Jersey governor is given a deadline of 10 days to sign a bill once the Legislature votes to implement the governor’s recommendations. Though the bill did pass only months before the election, we confirmed that Christie had given it a conditional veto more than a year prior. Effectiveness One final note: When we ran this claim by people who study pay discrimination in New Jersey, they said that Christie approved the bills that were less aggressive in addressing pay disparity. Compared to other states, New Jersey was in the middle of the pack with an earning ratio of 79 percent. Women had a median annual earning of $47,878, while men earned $60,878. Since the two bills (A-2647 and A-2648) became law in 2012 and 2013, New Jersey has seen little improvement in the gender wage gap. Our ruling Ultraviolet said Chris Christie ""vetoed equal pay for women 3 times. He only let the bill pass once it became a damaging campaign issue."" Christie did veto three bills that were intended to narrow the gender wage gap, but it was out of a legislative package of four bills, and he eventually signed two of them into law. Additionally, It is unlikely that Christie only let one of the bills pass because it became a damaging campaign issue, considering Christie gave a conditional veto and recommended changes to the bill over a year before his re-election. The claim has an element of truth, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/jul/13/ultraviolet/did-chris-christie-veto-equal-pay-women-ultraviole/

Bernie Sanders says 'real unemployment' rate for African American youth is 51 percent
","During a campaign event in Portland, Maine, that attracted thousands of supporters, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders made a striking claim about unemployment among African-American youth. ""For young people who have graduated high school or dropped out of high school, who are between the ages of 17 and 20, if they happen to be white, the unemployment rate is 33 percent,"" he said. ""If they are Hispanic, the unemployment rate is 36 percent. If they are African-American, the real unemployment rate for young people is 51 percent."" A reader asked us to check whether Sanders was correct, so we took a closer look. (Sanders seems to have made this a go-to talking point in his campaign; he offered a similar claim in an interview with The Nation.) We’ll start by noting that the most commonly used unemployment-rate statistic is not as high for each group as Sanders indicated. The most readily available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics covers the age range from 16 to 19, which isn’t identical but gives a quick approximation. For whites in that age range, the official unemployment rate was 15.7 percent, for Hispanics it was 20.8 percent and for African-Americans it was 31.8 percent. In other words, the official unemployment rate shows the same general pattern -- that African-American youth unemployment is significantly higher than white youth unemployment and, to a lesser extent, higher than Hispanic youth unemployment. Still, the levels for each group are lower than what Sanders said. So what’s going on? Sanders’ camp pointed us to research by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. This data is different from the more familiar measurements for a few reasons. One, the institute didn’t just look at employment status for people between the ages of 17 and 20; it limited its reach to high school graduates who were not enrolled in further schooling. And two, EPI counted not only unemployed workers but also those who were working part-time due to the weakness of the economy and those who were ""marginally attached to the labor force."" The latter category includes people who did not meet the strict definition of being in the job market, but weren’t entirely out of the market, either. The statistic EPI used, known by the wonky shorthand U-6, is officially called a measure of ""labor underutilization"" rather than ""unemployment."" EPI itself used the term ""underemployment"" in its research. It’s a real statistic, but Sanders didn’t really describe it the correct way. He twice used the term ""unemployment rate"" and once used the variation ""real unemployment rate,"" a vague term that doesn’t have any official definition at BLS and wasn’t mentioned in the EPI research he was quoting. On the other hand, Sanders’ choice of statistics actually understated his broader point. Since it’s reasonable to assume that dropouts have an even higher unemployment rate than high-school graduates, the figure for ""young people who have graduated high school or dropped out of high school,"" as he put it, is probably even higher than 51 percent, since that figure includes only high school graduates. All in all, economists agreed that Sanders had a point despite his problems with terminology. ""He should have been clearer,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. ""But I think the overall scale is right. Both education and race are predictive of employment outcomes in the United States. A number of different studies show that even for the same levels of education, minorities appear to have worse average employment outcomes."" Our ruling Sanders said that for African-Americans between the ages of 17 and 20, ""the real unemployment rate … is 51 percent."" His terminology was off, but the numbers he used check out, and his general point was correct -- that in an apples-to-apples comparison, African-American youth have significantly worse prospects in the job market than either Hispanics or whites do. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/13/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-real-unemployment-rate-african/
