Romney ad says more Hispanics are in poverty since Obama took office
","
In a new Web ad, the Romney campaign questions how Hispanics in the U.S. have fared under President Barack Obama.

The ad, titled ""Dismal,"" flashes shadowy faces of Latinos along with text citing rising unemployment and poverty rates in that minority group. The statistics are bookended by clips from Obama’s own Spanish-language ads that say the country is moving in the right direction.

""Really?"" the ad asks.

We decided to take a look at one of those statistical claims, specifically that ""more Hispanics have fallen into poverty under Obama.""

As evidence, the ad cites U.S. Census Bureau figures, which show that poverty has been on the rise. In 2008, the census says, there were about 47.4 million Hispanics in the U.S. Almost 11 million, or 23.2 percent were impoverished.

In 2009, 48.8 million Hispanics were living in the U.S., with more than 12 million in poverty. That marked a 2.1 percent increase in the poverty rate. And in 2010, it ticked up another 1.3 percent.

All told, through 2010, 2.25 million more Hispanics are living in poverty than when Obama took office. So the numbers back up the point.

But it's important to explore how much the Hispanic poverty rate can be blamed on Obama's policies. When rating claims such as this, PolitiFact weighs not only whether the claim is numerically correct but also whether it’s accurate to assign blame to the target of the ad.

First, we should note that poverty across all groups was up in these years. The nation’s official poverty rate went from 14.3 percent in 2009 to 15.1 percent in 2010. So Hispanics weren’t alone, but they were harder hit.

""Poverty increased for pretty much every demographic group in the country. There are more poor whites, blacks and Hispanics,"" said Madeline Zavodny, a professor of economics at Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, and a research fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.

But Hispanics felt the impact more.

""They are especially vulnerable to downturns. They are more likely to work in cyclical industries, like construction and manufacturing, than other demographic groups. Construction in particular was hit hard this downturn, and Hispanics bore the brunt of that,"" Zavodny said.

Sheldon Danziger, director of the National Poverty Center at the University of Michigan, said it's off-base to pin the blame on Obama.

""It’s not like anything Obama did was anti-Hispanic,"" Danziger said. ""It’s because of the collapse of construction.""

Mark Hugo Lopez, associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center, pointed to the original trigger for the recession: the housing bubble. When the economy was growing, largely on the expanding housing market, many Hispanics were able to buy their own homes. That tied up their wealth, which tends to be less diversified than non-Hispanics who invest more widely in stocks and 401(k) funds, Lopez said. So when the bubble burst and housing values fell, many Hispanics saw their household wealth evaporate.

Gary Burtless from the centrist Brookings Institution added that the Hispanic population is younger as a whole than other groups, ""and younger adults have suffered badly -- in the job market and as new homeowners who may be under water as a result of declining house prices."" 
(As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

We also talked to Leticia Miranda, senior policy adviser for the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group. She said unemployment is the single biggest driver of poverty and Hispanics are particularly vulnerable.

She said that some policies have had a direct impact on Hispanics, such as the 1996 welfare reform bill, which imposed a five-year ban on use of public assistance including Medicaid, food stamps and welfare cash payments by legal immigrants.

But she said Obama has made some positive strides to benefit Hispanics. Under Obama, the Department of Labor has put a greater focus on low-wage workers as well as on wage theft -- essentially workers not getting paid for their labor -- which tends to afflict immigrant workers, Miranda said.

Finally, each of the experts we interviewed mentioned the economic stimulus package Obama signed in 2009 as a barrier that kept poverty from ballooning even more.

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, determined that direct income assistance from the stimulus kept 2 million additional Hispanics from falling below the poverty line. Author Arloc Sherman found that 500,000 Hispanics benefitted from the temporary Making Work Pay tax credit, more than 600,000 from temporary improvements to the Earned Income Tax Credit and other tax credits for low-income working families, and more than 600,000 Latino Americans kept out of poverty through 2009 and 2010 extensions of stronger unemployment insurance championed by the president.

Miranda called those ""big positives for low-wage workers.""

Our ruling

Romney’s ad correctly states that more Hispanics in the U.S. have fallen below the poverty line since Obama took office: 2.25 million more people through 2010, according to the census.

But the ad’s clear message is that it’s Obama’s fault but experts say it's a much more complicated picture than that. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097635E00>],/factchecks/2012/jun/08/mitt-romney/romney-ad-says-more-hispanics-are-poverty-obama-to/

Barack Obama ad says manufacturing jobs fared worse in Massachusetts under Romney
","
President Barack Obama’s campaign took aim at Mitt Romney’s economic record as governor of Massachusetts in a television ad released June 4, 2012. The campaign is paying a reported $10 million to air the ad in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

One of the claims: ""When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts lost 40,000 manufacturing jobs, a rate twice the national average.""

We'll examine this claim in two parts: Are the numbers right? And is Romney to blame?

We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment data. We looked at state-level, seasonally adjusted data for manufacturing jobs during Romney’s tenure, which ran from January 2003 to January 2007.

Over that period, Massachusetts manufacturing jobs declined from 336,000 to 298,200 -- a difference of 38,000 jobs. It’s not 40,000, but it’s close.

As for the second part of the claim -- the rate of decrease -- Massachusetts manufacturing jobs fell by 11.3 percent over the four-year period. The drop for the nation was 5.8 percent. That means the Massachusetts decline was nearly twice that of the nation as the ad claimed.

So the Obama campaign is right on the numbers. But is Romney to blame?

What happened before and after Romney?

In supporting material for the ad, the Obama campaign argues that Romney’s manufacturing-employment record in Massachusetts represents a departure from the four-year periods before and after his tenure.

In the four years before Romney took office, the manufacturing job decline was slightly outpacing the national rate, down 16.7 percent in Massachusetts compared with a national rate of 14.7.

After Romney, the Massachusetts decline was 15.1 percent vs. 17 nationally.

The Obama camp has a point that Massachusetts’ decline only diverged significantly from the national rate during Romney’s tenure. However, looking at the numbers before and after Romney’s term also reveals that the manufacturing job loss under Romney (11.3 percent) was slower than it was in either the previous four-year period (16.7 percent) or the successive four-year period (15.1 percent). This weakens the Obama campaign’s argument.

Who gets the blame?

This is an issue we've addressed often with governors from many states. As we’ve noted before, economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively modest impact on a state's economy.

""Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered.""
   
(As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

The Obama campaign points out that in 2005 and 2006, Romney vetoed spending allocations to the Massachusetts Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a state- and federally funded organization that aids smaller manufacturing companies. However, as the Obama campaign also acknowledges, the Democratic controlled legislature overrode Romney’s veto and restored funding to the partnership. So while Romney’s vetoes may show something about the then-governor’s opinion of public-private efforts to boost the manufacturing sector, they don’t speak to the claim we’re checking, which addresses job growth on his watch. Once funding was restored, Romney received ""credit"" in the job statistics for any employment impact that the partnership may have fostered.

The long-term decline of manufacturing

Manufacturing -- for a variety of reasons, ranging from the expansion of free trade to patterns of educational attainment to the emergence of new sectors such as information technology -- has nosedived throughout the nation during the past 50 years.

Here's how manufacturing’s share of private sector jobs has declined every 10 years over the past half-century:

1962: 33 percent
1972: 29 percent
1982: 24 percent
1992: 19 percent
2002: 14 percent
2012: 11 percent

The numbers for Massachusetts look similar (data is only available since 1990):

1992: 16 percent
2002: 11 percent
2012: 8 percent

Our ruling

The Obama campaign’s numbers check out: Manufacturing jobs did decline at a steeper rate on Romney’s watch than they did nationally. Still, it’s a stretch to lay at Romney’s feet the decline of manufacturing jobs in Massachusetts. His policies had a relatively small impact compared with the decades-long trend beyond the control of any politician. And the rate of decline under Romney was actually slower than it was before and after he took office. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097382AC0>],/factchecks/2012/jun/08/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-manufacturing-jobs-fared-wors/

E.W. Jackson says Galveston has privatized plan in lieu of Social Security
","
When Republican E.W. Jackson extols free markets, he points to the gulf coast in Texas.

""Right now, in our own country, in Galveston, Texas, they have allowed people to privatize part of their Social Security. And people are building wealth,"" he said in a recent debate between the four Republicans running in the June 12 primary for the U.S. Senate.

We decided check out Jackson’s statement. It required two determinations: 1) Does Galveston have a private retirement plan in lieu of Social Security taxes and; 2) If so, how does the system build wealth?

The Galveston Plan

Greg Aldridge, a spokesman for Jackson’s campaign, pointed us to a number of news stories about Galveston’s alternative to Social Security. The plan has been considered as a potential model for changing the federal entitlement.

The program is an oddity in American retirement-security policy. In 1981, municipal employees of three adjoining Texas counties -- Galveston, Matagorda and Brazoria -- voted to withdraw from Social Security and initiate a system of individual accounts to provide retirement, survivor and disability benefits.

In 1983, the federal government barred any more such moves by local governments. Today, there are about 10 million Americans in the workforce who do not contribute and will not benefit from Social Security. Most of them are employees of school districts and higher education institutions that opted out before the ban.

Here’s how the Galveston plan works: Instead of paying into Social Security, county government workers contribute a similar amount to their investment accounts. The General Accounting Office wrote in 1999 that the plan made ""very conservative"" investments in bonds and preferred stocks.

The investments are made through fixed annuity contracts with private firms that guarantee minimum annual rates of return. While each worker is assigned an individual account, the employee does not control all investment decisions.

The interest earned on investments is deposited in each worker’s account. Employees can put extra money beyond the required amount into their accounts.

The required retirement contribution is 9.7 percent of gross pay -- of which 6.1 percent is paid by the employees and 3.6 percent by the county.

Social Security traditionally collects 12.4 percent in payroll tax on up to $106,800 in total salary, with workers and employers evenly splitting the levy. But under President Barack Obama’s FICA tax cut over the last two years, the federal government has collected only 10.4 percent -- of which 4.2 percent is paid by the worker. Social Security invests the contributions in government securities.

When the Texas county employees retire, they may choose to take the entire account’s earnings in lump sum, take monthly payments for a specified number of years, or accept smaller monthly payments in a lifetime annuity. The Galveston plan does not offer cost-of-living increases to those receiving monthly checks.

Social Security provides a lifetime annuity with annual cost-of-living adjustments. And, unlike the Galveston system, it also provides increased payment to beneficiaries with spouses and dependents.

Does it build wealth?

Jackson supports a Republican proposal that would create individual Social Security accounts and phase in investment options.  He says on his website that the proposal would ""allow participants to obtain better returns on the market"" than they do under the current system.

But Jackson, while extolling the Galveston plan during the debate, did not claim that it was outperforming Social Security. Aldridge said that Jackson, in saying the program was ""building wealth,"" simply meant that individuals have ownership and some control over their retirement account.

Galveston plan designer Rick Gornto, who is president of First Financial Benefits Inc., claimed that as the major advantage to the plan.

""The key thing is you don’t have ownership in Social Security or a right to that except the right that they decide to give you, which can change,"" he said.

Gornto could not provide an average annual return for plan investors because each chooses a mix of mutual funds to go along with the more stable bond investments in the fund. But, he said, retirement funds must, by contract, increase annually by at least 3.75 percent or 4 percent. During good times, Gornto said employees have seen annual returns of 10 percent or better.

Does the Galveston plan outperform Social Security? The most recent studies of this question are 13 years old and provided a complicated answer.

The GAO and the Social Security Administration each analyzed the Galveston plan in 1999. They generally agreed that the higher an employee’s salary, the more he or she would benefit from the counties’ system. But middle- and low-income earners would likely collect less from Galveston plan than they would from Social Security.

We spoke to Eric Kingson, professor at Syracuse University’s School of Social Work and co-chairman of Strengthen Social Security, a group that wants to maintain benefits from the federal entitlement.  He said the Galveston program is a ""savings plan, not a retirement insurance plan"" that best serves a small group of workers.

""The only people who might do better are single persons who have higher incomes,"" he said. ""Particularly for low and moderate income persons, they are not better off. If you are not married, not going to drop dead early, not leave widows or survivors and don’t want automatic life insurance for children, then it could be better.""

Our ruling

Jackson is correct that Galveston, Texas, has a privately run retirement plan in lieu of Social Security. The program benefits municipal workers in Galveston County and two neighboring counties.

It’s debatable whether the Galveston plan, overall, offers workers a superior financial alternative to Social Security; in some cases it does, in others it doesn’t. But, as Jackson said, the plan  does build wealth because it allows workers to create individual retirement accounts that are guaranteed to earn interest each year. The employees have some control over their accounts and can leave them to their survivors.  

So we rate Jackson’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809696D240>],/factchecks/2012/jun/08/ew-jackson/ew-jackson-says-galveston-has-privatized-plan-lieu/

Rick Perry says Obama has played nearly 100 rounds of golf
","
Texas Gov. Rick Perry warmed up delegates to the Republican Party of Texas convention in Fort Worth on June 7, 2012, by mentioning the Democratic president he once hoped to succeed.

Saying the country needs a president ""who believes in us again,"" Perry continued, according to his prepared remarks: ""Three and a half years, and nearly 100 rounds of golf into his presidency, Barack Obama has exploded the federal debt, passed a failed, budget-busting stimulus package, socialized health care, and provided guns to Mexican drug cartels.""

That’s a handful of provocative claims -- including the familiar one we are tackling here about Obama and ""fore!""

Has Obama played nearly 100 rounds of golf?

We know already, due to our April 2012 confirmation of a David Dewhurst claim, that Obama had played over 90 rounds of golf through May 2, 2012. That article pointed out, too, that many presidents have gone golfing. 
Our sources for the Obama count included CBS newsman Mark Knoller, who has long tracked each president’s outings, and another White House correspondent, Keith Koffler, who has taken to blogging about times that Obama goes golfing.

Koffler said in a Dec. 26, 2011, blog post: ""After an hour of hiking, President Obama Monday got down to the serious business at hand, heading out to golf for the second day in his first three days of vacation. He was back on the course at Marine Corps Base Hawaii. With this one, Obama reaches a new milestone, having gone golfing 90 times in less than three years as president.""

So, is Obama approaching 100 rounds of golf? Looks like it. Koffler posted a blog on May 26, 2012 stating that Obama was going golfing that day for his 98th time as president. On June 8, 2012, Koffler replied to our inquiry by saying that Obama has yet to play round 99. 
We rate Perry’s claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809696BC00>],/factchecks/2012/jun/08/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-obama-has-played-nearly-100-rounds/

Bill Clinton touts fiscal record as president during campaign stop in New Jersey
","
Speaking at a campaign event in New Jersey last week for U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, former President Bill Clinton offered his own ""fact check"" on deficits and the national debt.

Democrats Menendez and President Barack Obama have been criticized for those issues, Clinton said, but Republican administrations over the last 30 years have increased the debt. On his watch, the former Democratic president said he delivered four consecutive surplus budgets and reduced the debt by $600 billion.

""It took us four years to balance the budget,"" Clinton told the crowd at the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford. ""Then I gave you four surplus budgets for the first time in more than 70 years, paid $600 billion down on the national debt.""

A video of the June 1 event was posted the following day on YouTube. (In a separate video, Clinton weighs in on whether the horse ""I’ll Have Another"" could become a Triple Crown winner Saturday at the Belmont Stakes.)

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Clinton’s history lesson needs a fact-check of its own.

It’s accurate that Clinton delivered the first four consecutive surplus budgets in more than 70 years, but his claim about reducing the national debt is off. One form of debt dropped by nearly $453 billion over those four fiscal years, but the total debt increased by roughly $400 billion.

First, let’s talk about those surplus budgets.

In each of Clinton’s first four complete fiscal years -- fiscal years 1994 to 1997 -- the nation incurred a deficit, meaning federal spending surpassed revenues. The deficits declined every year, from about $203 billion to nearly $22 billion.

But in fiscal year 1998, the country reached a balanced budget for the first time since fiscal year 1969.

From fiscal years 1998 to 2001, the nation achieved a surplus each time for a combined total of about $559 billion. The last surplus budget year ended under President George W. Bush, but it began while Clinton was still in office.

The last time there were at least four consecutive surplus budgets was the period between fiscal years 1927 and 1930.

Now, we’ll discuss debt reduction in the latter half of the Clinton presidency.

Since Clinton just referred to the ""national debt,"" we’ll look at both of the commonly cited measures: debt held by the public and total debt.

The debt held by the public refers to money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public and money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare.

Clinton is somewhat accurate in terms of the debt held by the public, but he’s wrong as far as the total debt. 
As we said earlier, the combined surpluses over those four fiscal years totaled about $559 billion. But due to various types of factors -- commonly known as ""other means of financing"" -- the debt held by the public was only reduced by nearly $453 billion.

Also, with an increase in the money the government owes itself, the total debt grew by about $400 billion in the same time period.

It’s worth noting that Clinton had to work with a Republican-controlled Congress during the fiscal years when there were surplus budgets and the debt held by the public was reduced.

Our ruling

At a June 1 campaign event, Clinton touted his fiscal record in the final years of his presidency. ""Then I gave you four surplus budgets for the first time in more than 70 years, paid $600 billion down on the national debt,"" Clinton told the crowd.

Clinton delivered four consecutive surplus budgets for the first time in more than seven decades, but the former president misstated the level of debt reduction. During those four fiscal years, the debt held by the public dropped by nearly $453 billion, but total debt jumped by about $400 billion.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Roger Williams']","
Roger Williams says Obama is a socialist
","
U.S. House hopeful Roger Williams, the former Texas secretary of state, considers President Barack Obama anti-business and worse. According to a June 6, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, Williams said at an appearance before the Republican Club of Austin: ""We need business people more than ever to go to Washington and make these business decisions instead of these political decisions. We need somebody to fight for small businesses.""

Williams also vowed to ""fight a president who's, quite frankly, a socialist,"" the story says.

Is Obama, who won election as a Democrat, a socialist?

This was not the first time Williams, who faces retired Army Lt. Col. Wes Riddle in a July runoff for the Congressional District 25 Republican nomination, has laid stake to the claim. His campaign website features a June 11, 2011, video of Williams speaking to the Rockwall County Republican Men’s Club and saying of Obama: ""Quit trying to figure him out. Quit trying to decide if he’s smart enough for this job or whatever. The guy is smart. He’s a socialist, OK?"" The video was made by The Rockwall News.

By email, Williams’ campaign manager, Colby Hale, pointed to a dictionary definition of socialism as ""any of various social systems based on shared or government ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of good.""

His email offers as indications of Obama being a socialist his call while running for president for universal health care to be funded by employers and tax increases for wealthy Americans and his signing into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which is sometimes called Obamacare.

Hale said that law doesn’t achieve universal coverage but, he said, it contains elements qualifying it as socialism including regulations and measures to ""redistribute earnings from certain sets of people in order to give an un-earned benefit to others."" Asked what this references, Hale singled out projected cost reductions, tax increases and penalties for not obtaining health coverage associated with the law.

In January 2012, PolitiFact found the health care law a poor example of socialism while reviewing Gov. Rick Perry’s reference to Obama as a socialist. Why? The health care law relies largely on the free-enterprise system. To increase health care coverage for the uninsured and people in small business, the law sets up exchanges to encourage private health insurance companies to compete.

On the day Williams spoke in Austin, the Associated Press posted a news article on the socialist charge about Obama quoting Greg Pason, national secretary of the Socialist Party USA, saying that Obama's health care overhaul ""is anything but socialist. It's bailing out for-profit companies."" 
More broadly, Billy Wharton, co-chair of the Socialist Party USA, wrote a commentary published in the Washington Post on March 15, 2009 suggesting that not only is Obama no socialist, he may ""not even be a liberal. Socialists understand him more as a hedge-fund Democrat -- one of a generation of neoliberal politicians firmly committed to free-market policies,"" Wharton wrote.

Hale’s email also singles out Obama’s plans, declared as a presidential candidate, to tax and penalize ""energy producers and energy users in order to finance some set of goals, subsidies, and programs."" The email labels this ""cap and tax,"" meaning it refers to Obama’s promise as a candidate to forge a ""cap and trade"" approach to reducing climate-warming carbon emissions. The idea is that the government sets a limit (the cap) on how much carbon different companies can emit. The government then issues permits to companies -- typically electric utilities and manufacturers -- and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed (the trade). If the policy works as intended, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those who lower emissions most effectively.

Republicans attacked the plan as a job-killing energy tax. And in November 2010, Obama’s promise was rated Broken on the PolitiFact Obamater after Obama acknowledged its prospects of clearing Congress had diminished.

Williams is hardly the first Republican to call Obama a socialist. PolitiFact ultimately rated Perry’s description of Obama as a socialist Pants on Fire after earlier founding no basis for such assessments by others, rating Pants on Fire a 2008 claim by Sarah Palin based on Obama's conversation with Joe the Plumber (as Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher came to be known after that conversation) that Obama's tax policy was socialism. In 2010, PolitiFact Oregon and other PolitiFact state sites checked a claim by bloggers that 70 House Democrats are socialists (Pants on Fire). In September 2011, we found such a charge about two Texas Democrats similarly flammable; see that review here.

Let’s recap PolitiFact’s January 2012 check on whether other Obama initiatives signal a socialist lean.

Obama’s tax policy tracks with the progressive approach that has been the cornerstone of American tax policy since the federal government first collected an income tax in 1863, an approach embraced by Republicans and Democrats. It was based on the Tax Act of 1862, which President Abraham Lincoln signed, and which imposed a ""duty of three per centum"" on all income over $600, and five percent on income over $10,000.
   
The idea is that the wealthy pay a larger share of their income because they are more able to afford it. To the extent the government then gives some of the money to the less-wealthy through various programs, you could say the income is being redistributed. But that concept has been embraced by Republicans and Democrats for well over a century.
   
That's a far cry from true socialism.

What of Obama’s economic stimulus, also criticized by Republicans, or his support for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)?
   
In February 2009, Obama and the Democrats muscled through a $787 billion spending package to try to jump-start the economy. The program was about one-third tax cuts and two-thirds government spending on everything from clean energy initiatives to electronic speed-limit signs. It's true that government payrolls were stabilized or grew because of the infusion, but it was nowhere near a government takeover of our private enterprise economy.
   
Obama inherited the TARP, which was the Bush administration's plan for stabilizing the economy. It was designed to prevent financial firms from collapsing by buying assets and stakes in the companies. In December 2008, President George W. Bush authorized use of the money for loans to U.S. automakers.
   
Obama has emphasized he was not eager for the U.S. government to be involved in such efforts, but he considered them necessary. ""If there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans, and everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank bailout,"" he said in his 2010 State of the Union Address, adding that ""if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today.  More businesses would certainly have closed.  More homes would have surely been lost. So I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program.  And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable.  And as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banks.""
   
Many Republicans opposed the TARP -- an initiative of a Republican administration -- as too much government intrusion into the private enterprise system. This is an area where one could begin to make a case that the government was taking ownership, but as a percentage of the full U.S. economy, it was relatively small and temporary.
   
Experts agree that either taken alone or piled up together, Obama’s initiatives fail to demonstrate that he is bent on socialism.

""Socialism means public ownership of the means of production. Obama does not believe this. Therefore he is not a socialist,"" conservative economist Bruce Bartlett told PolitiFact in an e-mail. ""Although it is true that the federal government did come to own some private businesses as a consequence of bailout policies initiated by the George W. Bush administration such as TARP, the Obama administration sold many of them -- such as its shares in GM -- as quickly as feasible. A true socialist would have held on to them.""
   
Dan Mitchell, a scholar on fiscal policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, says there are other words for Obama's expansion of government (he thinks ""fascism"" is a fair term or perhaps statist), but that it's not accurate to call it socialism.
   
Daniel N. Shaviro, professor of taxation at New York University Law School, said ""it is a lie"" to say Obama is a socialist. ""If he is a socialist, so were Eisenhower and Bush Sr.""

Our ruling
   
Republicans and Democrats frequently diverge over tax policy, economics and the role of government. Certain Obama policies may have expanded government. Some perceive the health care law as government asserting more control over health care. But we don't see how that's fodder for Obama being a socialist. 
Indeed, not only is there no case for Obama being a socialist, it's a preposterous sally. We're snatching the matches -- Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A8800>],/factchecks/2012/jun/08/roger-williams/roger-williams-says-obama-socialist/

PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the lawmakers have indeed reversed course -- particularly since some facing the criticism signed a specific pledge to oppose any tax increases.

The lawmakers and their spokesmen said no.

PolitiFact Georgia began a search for clarity.

The Washington-based Americans for Tax Reform has become a major player in Republican Party politics with its Taxpayer Protection Pledge. More than half the members of the U.S. House of Representatives have signed the pledge. Nearly half the U.S. Senate has signed it. Nearly all the signers are Republicans. Both U.S. senators from Georgia (Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson) have signed the pledge, along with GOP House members Paul Broun, Phil Gingrey, Tom Graves, Jack Kingston, Tom Price, Austin Scott and Lynn Westmoreland.

More than 50 members of the Georgia Legislature have signed the pledge.

So, too, has Deal, who signed it May 10, 2010, during his campaign for governor.

A couple of Democrats in the Georgia House of Representatives are listed on the pledge list.

ATR believes any new legislation or changes to an existing tax structure that results in a new tax increase on individuals is a violation of the pledge by lawmakers who have signed it. Some Democrats blamed ATR President Grover Norquist for last year’s failure by Congress to agree on a long-term debt deal.

In recent weeks, some GOP lawmakers have done the unthinkable -- taken on Norquist in the media. They have complained the pledge doesn’t offer enough flexibility to handle the federal government’s financial challenges. But those are federal issues.

Here, we are concerned with a local penny sales tax increase that would raise a lot of money for transportation projects.

The proposed Georgia sales tax would raise about $7 billion over the next 10 years, planners have said.

We asked Norquist whether Georgia lawmakers who’ve spoken in favor of the referendum have violated the pledge they’ve signed.

""It does violate the pledge,"" he said. ""It’s a rather significant tax increase.""

The language in the pledge is different for federal and state officials.

The federal pledge asks signers to oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal tax rate on individuals and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions or tax credits ""unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing taxes.""

The state pledge is less detailed, simply stating that the signer ""will oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes.""

Although some federal lawmakers from Georgia such as Chambliss and Westmoreland have spoken in favor of the referendum, PolitiFact Georgia decided to focus more on state leaders since the sales tax does not fit the description of what constitutes a violation of the federal no-tax pledge.

The 1 percent sales tax, also known as T-SPLOST, has the support of some commuters eager for any improvements to shorten travel time. Some proponents also argue the projects will help the region’s economy by hiring people to work on the proposed jobs. Some opponents argue that the project list will not do enough to improve commuting in metro Atlanta. Some say it will not get enough motorists out of their cars and into mass transit. Others are skeptical that the plan will be carried out as stated by regional leaders.

Deal’s name was atop a flier for a May 23 fundraiser in support of T-SPLOST held at the home of former Cousins Properties CEO Tom Bell in Buckhead. The governor said it is important to attract companies to the state. Deal has spoken in support of the referendum to several large audiences in recent months, such as at the Atlanta Press Club, at an event in Savannah and to the Greater North Fulton Chamber of Commerce.

Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said it’s unfair to say the governor has flip-flopped on his commitment not to support a tax increase. Robinson said the referendum was approved before Deal took office.

""This is not a violation of the pledge. [Nathan Deal] has cut taxes. This passed before he was governor. He is advocating for Georgians to approve it, not imposing it on them,"" Robinson said via email.

Robinson added: ""Governor Deal didn’t father this baby.""

Robinson said the T-SPLOST is in line with conservative principles such as consumption-based taxes. He also said the proposed penny tax is ""the best program"" to help reduce the region’s gridlock problems.

""The fact is Grover Norquist doesn’t have to commute in Atlanta,"" Robinson said.

Norquist said if state leaders feel compelled to spend more on transportation, they should spend less in other areas.

Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle isn’t on the list of people who’ve signed the pledge, but he’s taken heat for his support of the referendum. Cagle spokesman Ben Fry made an argument similar to Robinson’s that a referendum is different than state lawmakers imposing new taxes.

""In the end, Casey Cagle has as much say as any Georgia voter,"" Fry said.

Some state lawmakers who signed the pledge and made statements that suggest they support the referendum didn’t respond when we called.

Others, such as Amos Amerson, leaving the House of Representatives after 12 years, said he decided the pledge isn’t always practical and asked in a 2002 letter to be removed from the list when he heard talk about raising the cigarette tax to help fund skyrocketing state health care costs. Amerson said he never received an answer to his request.

As for his support of T-SPLOST, Amerson said: ""Georgia has to do something for road improvements. We just do not have the money.""

There’s a good debate to be had about the issue of transportation spending.

The problem for lawmakers who signed the pledge is it specifically states ""that I will oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes.""

The T-SPLOST is an increase in the sales tax. There are no cuts to make it revenue-neutral.

Did John Ludlow, as mayor of Wilsonville, drive TriMet out of town?
","
Taxpayer spending on transit, urban renewal and public safety are just some of the big issues dominating the race between Charlotte Lehan and John Ludlow for Clackamas County chair. Ludlow styles himself as the spending watchdog and crowed recently about how, when he was mayor of Wilsonville, the city dumped TriMet in favor of its own bus system. (TriMet, by the way, is unpopular in some circles.)

""As Mayor of Wilsonville,"" writes Ludlow in a statement posted to his campaign website, ""I drove TriMet out of town and replaced their bloated transit system with our own local bus line that offers better service and has saved our businesses millions of dollars.""

There are many tantalizing strings to follow. Is TriMet a bloated transit system? Is Wilsonville’s local bus system -- called SMART for South Metro Area Regional Transit -- really a money saver? But in the end, what we really wanted to know was this: Did Ludlow run TriMet out of town and replace it with what would become SMART?

To answer this, we did some time-traveling into our news archives.

We uncovered news stories documenting that in October 1988, the Wilsonville City Council voted unanimously to support a withdrawal resolution from TriMet. The resolution was backed by businesses that argued the city could pay less and get more with its own transit system.

In November, the TriMet Board agreed to the withdrawal. And in January 1989, Ludlow was sworn in as mayor, replacing Bill Stark.

Ludlow, in other words, was not mayor when the city council voted to dump TriMet. Nor was he on council when TriMet agreed to drop Wilsonville.

So how does Ludlow get to claim that as mayor he drove TriMet out of Wilsonville?

""It was signed into law when I was mayor,"" he told PolitiFact Oregon. In fact, he said he recalled presentations in chambers to develop a replacement bus system. ""That definitely happened under my reign.""  

We’re certain that as mayor Ludlow oversaw the selection and implementation of a new transit system. SMART’s timeline shows that in 1989, the city signed a contract with Buck Ambulance Service and door-to-door service launched that year.

But the critical action took place before Ludlow took office. Businesses weren’t happy paying TriMet for service they deemed inadequate, so they checked state law to figure out how they could go their own way.

Ben Altman, a private planning consultant who was on the board of the Wilsonville Chamber of Commerce in 1988, said businesses raised money for a public survey and feasibility study. ""We had to do a budget analysis and show how the city could do it as well, or better than, TriMet,"" he said.

The resolution was adopted 5-0 on Oct. 3, 1988.

Ludlow was a member of the commerce chamber, but he doesn’t recall spearheading the petition effort. And in any case, that’s not what he said. He said that as mayor, he drove TriMet out of town.

We find there’s some truth to Ludlow’s statement: He was mayor when the city officially separated from TriMet and he was mayor when the city sought to find a replacement transit system. But he was not mayor when the city council voted to withdraw from TriMet service, which we find to be the critical moment in the history of Wilsonville and TriMet.

We rule Ludlow’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C4A6C0>],/factchecks/2012/jun/07/john-ludlow/did-john-ludlow-mayor-wilsonville-drive-trimet-out/

Satire of Obama 'birthers,' Neil Abercrombie fools some emailers
","
We never cease to be amazed that the people who routinely forward chain emails are so gullible that they will also fall victim to satire. The latest episode involves one that was far-fetched even by birther standards.

""Please research this info claiming to be about the governor of Hawaii faking Obama’s birth certificate,"" the reader asked, explaining that it came from his brother-in-law. We also found the account posted on a few birther blogs, where it prompted comments like ""the MSM will never touch this story, or investigate it. Send it to Sheriff Joe, maybe he'll do something with it."" (That's a reference to Joe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff who has rekindled birther theories.)

The publisher of the original satire also got calls from people who believed it, as you'll see below.

The email says:

""New evidence now points a finger at Hawaii’s Governor Neil Abercrombie as the possible source of the widely disputed document purporting to be President Obama’s long form birth certificate. Surveillance photos of the South St. & Queen St. intersection routinely monitored by the Honolulu Fire Department have been leaked to the media. One frame clearly shows Governor Abercrombie leaving the Kinko’s late at night, on April 25th, two days before Obama unveiled the 'official' document.

""The night manager at Kinko’s, Mr. Marvin Ishikawa, further corroborated what was shown on the video.

""‘Sure I remember them,’ said Ishikawa. ‘They hogged my best graphics machine for hours. I thought the short guy looked a lot like the governor, but he said his name was John Smith. I thought it was kind of funny that they paid with a State of Hawaii government debit card.’ Ishikawa elaborated, ‘They were on that machine for almost two days straight, and I have the computer logs right here; 12 hours of Adobe Illustrator, 23 scans, a bunch of PhotoShop and several faxes back and forth to Washington, DC.’

""Asked to identify the man in the video, Ishikawa said, ‘Yeah, that’s him, that’s ""Smith."" ‘

""When Abercrombie first took office, he vowed to clear this birth certificate business up, once and for all, but by January of 2011 had given up. He basically told his friends that he simply ‘couldn’t find the dam thing.’ Things changed in April, when the President sent a letter to Hawaii’s Department of Health requesting a copy of the long form birth certificate.

""According to one un-named source inside the DOH, everybody, including the Governor’s Office, panicked, ‘We had to do what we had to do.’ ""

The text was accompanied by a green-tinted ""surveillance"" photo of a smiling Abercrombie holding the ""fake"" birth certificate outside the copy store in question. (Incidentally, Kinko’s changed its name to FedEx Office in 2008.)

The photo looked fake to us, and it wasn’t hard to debunk the text as well. We found that it originated on the website of the Hawaii Reporter, a news and commentary blog that has won investigative journalism awards and is perceived as somewhat right-of-center.

Whoever started this e-mail on its Internet voyage snipped off a bit of relevant information at the bottom of the story: ""EDITOR'S NOTE: This report is in our satire section.""

Malia Zimmerman, editor and co-founder of the Reporter, told us the item was written by Keith Rollman, a Hawaii political consultant who has worked for Democrats and Republicans and whose cartoons and writing are sometimes published on the Reporter’s website. He uses the pseudonym Atomic Monkey.

""We ran the piece on April Fools Day, in our comics section, and said in the story that it was satire,"" Zimmerman said. ""We did not expect people to take this seriously. But we still had people calling and emailing us demanding more information about the piece. We are still getting calls today. Most had a good sense of humor about it when we pointed out the April Fools Day note, but not everyone took it so well. We did get some nasty notes. Other than putting the very top in all-caps, ‘THIS IS AN APRIL FOOLS DAY JOKE,’ I am not sure what else we could have done to be more clear.""

We've seen this phenomenon before.

One of the most long-lived chain emails we’ve seen circulating claims that Obama once said, ""Nobody made these guys go to war. ... Now they whine about bearing the costs of their choice?"" That was originally published by Arizona-based satirist John Semmens. We gave it a Pants on Fire.

We have debunked other chain emails based on satires by Semmens. One claimed that that in a hearing, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., suggested to Gen. David Petraeus that the Army ""put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output."" Semmens’ work was also turned into chain emails claiming that Obama wants to redesign the American flag ""to better offer our enemies hope and love,"" and that he thinks the national anthem should be ""I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing.""

Another satirist who saw his work go viral is Matthew Avitabile, who blogs his spoofs at Jumping in Pools. One satirical Avitabile post claimed that Obama wrote a thesis at Columbia University in which he criticized ""plutocratic thugs"" and said the Constitution gave Americans ""the shackles of hypocrisy."" Another was that the Obama administration ""wants to have soldiers and officers pledge a loyalty oath directly to the office of the President, and no longer to the Constitution.""

The Abercrombie spoof doesn’t appear to have gained as much traction on the Internet as some of these other satires. Maybe it was too outlandish. As one commenter to the blog ""Native and Natural Born Citizenship Explored"" put it, ""The governor, sneaking down to Kinko’s …. LOL …. gives me flashbacks to college, when I often had to go to Kinko’s after midnight. No governors then, no governors now.""

Our ruling

It seems silly that we have to put these claims to the Truth-O-Meter, but given that the Hawaii Reporter received serious calls about it and that the chain email continues to circulate, we'll quickly set the meter on fire to shed a little light on the silliness.

"['Immigration', 'Elections', 'Poverty', 'Florida', 'Alcee Hastings']","
U.S. Rep. Hastings says Florida's noncitizen voter purge is a ""backdoor poll tax.""
","
Florida set off yet another firestorm about voting rights in May when state elections officials forwarded a list to counties of about 2,700 potential noncitizens who illegally registered to vote.

The state told county election supervisors to contact the residents and ask them to supply proof of citizenship. If the voters failed to comply, they’d be removed from the voter rolls within one or two months.

A partisan war broke out: Democrats cried foul that this was directed by Republican Gov. Rick Scott and just happening months before a presidential election. Republican leaders pointed out that it’s a felony for noncitizens to vote. A Miami Herald analysis determined that there were more Democrats than Republicans on the list and that about 58 percent were Hispanic.

The U.S. Department of Justice ordered the state to halt its noncitizen purge on May 31. A DOJ lawyer argued that Florida was violating federal law including the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Gov. Rick Scott is fighting the DOJ’s demand.

A few days before the feds intervened, two Democratic congressmen from South Florida -- Alcee Hastings and Ted Deutch -- held a press conference with a voter flagged by the state: Bill Internicola, a Brooklyn-born World War II vet, who had voted for decades and is a Democratic voter in Davie, a town in Broward County.

Before the press conference officially started, Hastings asked Internicola if the Broward Supervisor of Elections had mailed him a stamped envelope to send back his proof of citizenship. The answer: no. That led Hastings to say this during the press conference:

""There is also a backdoor poll tax. In the letter that he (Internicola) received I asked him a moment ago he did not have a prepaid envelope to send it back meaning he had to buy a stamp. Don’t tell me how little it is -- that stamp is a cost. And the state should not be about the business of emaciating voter rights. They should be in the business of causing people to participate.""

Was Hastings correct to compare the requests from elections officials to Internicola and others on the list to a ""backdoor poll tax""?

The process for documentation for those on the list 
The Florida Division of Elections started with a list of about 180,000 potential noncitizen voters based on drivers’ license data, which is not updated when someone later becomes a citizen. The state sent an initial batch of about 2,700 names to counties.

From there, county election supervisors mailed out letters asking the potential noncitizens to send back documentation proving U.S. citizenship (a copy of a birth certificate or passport, for example). Miami-Dade, the county with the highest number of voters on the list, did not provide an envelope while neighboring Broward County provided an envelope but no stamp.

Florida division of elections spokesman Chris Cate said the voters could respond to their county supervisor in a number of ways including in person, mail, email or fax.

""We have an obligation to ensure the integrity of Florida’s elections, and making sure the voter rolls are accurate is a crucial part of upholding the integrity of our elections,"" Cate said.

Some voters with access to a fax and a copy machine could have completed the process for free (or for the cost of the paper). For those who had to buy a 45-cent stamp and make copies or deliver it in person requiring gas and parking, we figure the cost for some could be less than $1 or up to $3.

History of the poll tax 
We interviewed 14 professors about the poll tax and Hastings’ claim. We also read this article by California Institute of Technology Professor Morgan Kousser and portions of a book about the history of voting rights by Harvard history professor Alex Keyssar. We also consulted our False ruling of U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s (D-Weston) claim that compared GOP-backed voting bills to Jim Crow.

Poll taxes referring to a tax on each male head had been around in various forms for many years, but after Reconstruction it was taken to mean a tax required to vote. Florida adopted one in 1889.

Southern states passed these poll taxes to raise revenue for state governments and to prevent poor blacks and poor whites from voting. Some experts described it as a concerted effort to halt blacks from voting while others said it was more a matter of class power.

""It wasn’t so much a matter of racial discrimination -- it was a matter of class power,"" Keyssar said in an interview. ""Black people were tenants and workers.""

Some states required poll taxes to be paid several months before an election and required voters to bring a receipt to vote -- further barriers to voting. The poll tax was effective because at $1 to $2, that was a significant amount of a person’s cash income.

The effect on turnout was significant. During the presidential races in the 1880s, black turnout in Georgia, which had the poll tax, was less than half of that in Florida, Kousser said.

It’s somewhat difficult to pinpoint the number disenfranchised by the poll tax or other voting restrictions. But Kousser said the poll tax disenfranchised millions in the South.

""It was more than any other single device responsible for fastening white supremacy on the South for 70 years or so,"" Kousser said.

Southern states starting repealing the poll tax in the 1930s including Florida. The 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution ratified in 1964 barred poll taxes in national elections and two years later the Supreme Court in Harper vs. Virginia barred them in state elections under the Equal Protection Clause.  

How is it the same or different than poll tax 
We asked experts on the poll tax and elections if they agreed with Hastings analogy and found no consensus. Some experts agreed with Hastings at least in part -- one professor said he’d start to use the same comparison.

""If voters, as a practical matter, are required to spend money out of their own pocket -- even a relatively small amount -- in order to prove their eligibility and therefore vote, then it's functionally equivalent to the poll tax,"" wrote Daniel Tokaji, election law professor at Ohio State University.

But other experts saw key differences in the poll tax and Florida’s recent potential noncitizen voter purge. One expert cautioned us that this is a partisan issue and that it might be difficult for PolitiFact to reach a factual conclusion.

""To most Democrats, what Hastings says is self-evidently true: Yes, it’s a back-door poll tax. They are trying to make it harder for poor people to vote,"" wrote Michael Klarman, a Harvard law professor who identified himself as a Democrat in an email. ""Most Republicans would deny this, and I think they truly believe what they are saying: They are trying to eliminate or reduce vote fraud. Most Democrats don’t acknowledge that such fraud exists.""

Here are the arguments for how the noncitizen voter documentation effort and the poll tax are the same:

• Both disproportionately affected minorities: The poll tax reduced the number of blacks who could vote. Florida’s potential noncitizen voter list was 58 percent Hispanic, 14 percent black and 13 percent white.

""Thus, Rep. Hastings' term, ‘a backdoor poll tax,’ is accurate as it applies to blacks as a group, because still today blacks have a lower median income than whites. Granted, it is not as onerous monetarily as the tax was back in the sixties, but it is still a tax that imposes a heavier burden, proportionally, on blacks than whites,"" said Chandler Davidson, a sociology professor at Rice University.

• Requiring extra steps for voters is a burden: Voters often had to show their receipt to vote under the poll tax which is analogous to the potential noncitizens having to present documents at elections’ offices in advance of voting.

• Both require at least some voters to pay to vote: In the case of the poll tax, it applied to all men but in reality was a burden for poor blacks and whites. Florida’s recent noncitizen voter purge required some residents to provide proof of citizenship which meant a cost for many to mail in documentation, make copies or drive and possibly pay to park at an elections office. Note this category also includes a difference: The poll tax applied to all while the recent purge applied to few.

Now, how it is different. 
• The cost for voters: The poll tax of between $1-$2 was a significant sum for blacks and poor whites at the time. The cost of a stamp and making a copy of a birth certificate today is less than the cost of the poll tax instituted more than 100 years ago.

""Now, when Mr. Hastings says potential voters might be disfranchised by having to buy a stamp, I say, ‘Give me a break!’ That is absurd,"" wrote East George College history professor T. Adams Upchurch. ""To put it in perspective, my home state of Mississippi levied its poll tax in 1890 at $2. That was tantamount to Florida voters today having to pay about $200 for the privilege of voting. Poor people could absolutely and rightly claim discrimination if that were the case. But a stamp? Please.""

• Numbers: The poll tax disenfranchised the majority of black residents as well as poor whites -- one professor said it disenfranchised about two-fifths of voters. The noncitizen voter drive affected a very small percentage of Florida’s electorate -- even if the state had continued to send names from the list of 180,000 that would be less than 2 percent of the overall nearly 11.3 million voters in Florida.

• Right to vote: Poor blacks and whites should have had a right to vote. In the current Florida case, noncitizens don’t have the right to vote -- it’s a felony. We haven’t heard anyone argue that noncitizens should get to cast a ballot -- the controversy is that there were errors on the list -- many were citizens. And some critics say that some voters simply didn’t get the letter or would be discouraged from responding. Since the many of those who received the letters didn’t respond to elections officials and the state was working with outdated information, it’s unclear if the majority on the list are citizens or not.

• Every expense associated with voting isn’t a poll tax: Many voters drive to the polls to vote -- the cost of gas isn’t a poll tax. In the noncitizen case, a stamp isn’t the only way to deliver the form -- someone might get a ride from a friend and drop it off.

We sent Hastings’ office our list of similarities and differences and asked if they wanted to respond and did not hear back.

Our ruling 
After Broward residents received letters asking them to submit documentation proving their citizenship in order to vote, Hastings described it as a ""backdoor poll tax"" because they had to buy a stamp to mail in the documents.

Hastings is correct that there are some similarities between the poll tax and Florida’s recent search for noncitizen voters. The most important similarity is that minorities in both cases were disproportionately affected. And in both cases, it added costs and burdens to vote.  

""Any effort to introduce an election procedure that requires some voters to incur financial costs could be thought of as a metaphoric or perhaps real poll tax,"" Keyssar said.

But there are some important differences including that the poll tax had a far more widespread effect than Florida’s search for noncitizen voters. While poor black sharecroppers couldn’t afford the poll tax, the issue for some of the Florida voters may be more of the inconvenience than the expense.

Bob Marshall says homosexual behavior cuts life expectancy by 20 years
","Del. Bob Marshall’s statements about homosexuals have generated plenty of controversy this spring.

Marshall, one of four candidates running in Tuesday’s GOP primary for the U.S. Senate, made national news May 15 when he led a successful movement in the House of Delegates to reject the judicial nomination of a gay prosecutor. Among other things, Marshall argued that Tracy Thorne-Begland could not be trusted on the bench to uphold Virginia’s ban on same-sex marriage.

Two days later, during an interview on CNN, Marshall again questioned Thorne-Begland’s ability to render fair judgments, saying, ""Sodomy is not a civil right.""

And during a campaign swing in Charlottesville on May 24, a reporter asked Marshall whether gay sex should be protected by the constitution.

""The court says it is in certain limited circumstances, but you know what that behavior does? It cuts your life by about 20 years,"" Marshall said.

Is Marshall right that the lifespan of gays is, on average, two decades shorter than heterosexuals? We asked him to provide proof.    

Marshall, who represents Prince William County, sent us an email citing a study published in June 1997 in the International Journal of Epidemiology. The report, conducted by researchers at the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, examined how HIV affected the mortality of gay and bisexual men in Vancouver from 1987 to 1992.

The study found that life expectancy at age 20 among gay and bisexual men in Vancouver was 8 to 21 years shorter than that of all men in the Canadian city. The researchers also said their conclusion probably underestimated the life expectancy deficit among gay and bisexual men because AIDS cases were underreported.

But that’s not the end of the story.

The report’s authors, in 2001, took exception to conservatives who used their study to condemn the lifestyle of gay and bisexual men. The researchers said circumstances had changed since their study ended in the early 1990s.

""If we were to repeat this analysis today the life expectancy of gay and bisexual men would be greatly improved,"" the authors wrote. ""Deaths from HIV infection have declined dramatically in this population since 1996.""

The researchers, however, did not conduct a new study on the life expectancy for gay and bisexual men.

We spoke to Julio Montaner, a co-author of the study and director of the British Columbia Center for Excellence in HIV/AIDs. He said Marshall’s statement is a ""gross misrepresentation"" of the research.

""To use my report to support the notion that gay and bisexual sex is somehow the reason why people die early is misusing the data,"" Montaner said.

Montaner noted that his group’s original report was conducted at a time when the HIV epidemic was poorly controlled and treatments were ineffective. Since then, there have have been great strides in treating the disease and preventing its spread, Montaner said. In British Columbia, annual diagnoses of new infections have dropped from 900 in the mid-1990s to 300 in recent years, he said. Deaths from HIV also have fallen sharply, he said.

In the United States, figures from the Centers for Disease Control show that the rate of HIV deaths per 100,000 people peaked at 36.3 deaths in 1995 and fell to 2.7 in 2010, the latest year data is available.

Gay and bisexual men remain the group most heavily affected by HIV, according to the CDC. Although they represent 2 percent of the U.S. population, gay and bisexual men accounted for 61 percent of new HIV infections in 2009.

Marshall, in his email, listed sent abstracts of other studies saying homosexuals have high rates of suicide attempts and certain types of cancer. Two of the studies cite high number of deaths among gay men from HIV and AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s.

""With significant investment in medical resources, homosexuals are living longer than in previous years with their compromised health status, but nevertheless still shorter lives than comparable married heterosexuals who don’t eat up medical resources to the same extent,"" Marshall wrote.

None of the other research Marshall listed proves his point that homosexual behavior today cuts life expectancy by 20 years.

Marshall, for example, cited a study by the American Journal of Public Health that examined the mortality of men and women in same-sex marriages in Denmark from 1989 to 2004. It found that death rates among those couples was a third higher than the general population, despite a significant drop among men in same-sex couples. Even so, the report, published in 2009, criticized other published claims that homosexuals have a life expectancy that’s more than 20 years shorter than heterosexuals.

""Although further research is needed, the claims of drastically increased overall mortality in gay men and lesbians appear unjustified,"" the report said.

We sought U.S. data on how how life expectancy of homosexuals compared to the rest of the population. But the CDC, which compiles statistics on longevity, doesn’t keep figures based on sexual orientation.

Laura Durso -- a public policy fellow at the Williams Institute at UCLA, which researches issues facing lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) people -- said few national population-based surveys in the U.S. inquire ask about sexual orientation. That makes it difficult to compare the life expectancies of homosexuals to heterosexuals, she said.

Still, Durso said, reports have shown that LGBT populations face increased certain health risks. LGBT youths in particular have been shown to have a higher rate of suicide, she said. Gay men appear to be at higher risk for anal cancer while lesbians appear to be at higher risk of breast cancer, she said.

Our Ruling

Bob Marshall said homosexual behavior cuts a person’s life by about 20 years.

The research Marshall cites to support his claim is two decades old and was conducted near the height of the HIV epidemic. One of the authors said there have been tremendous advances in HIV treatment over the last 20 years and that Marshall’s statement is a ""gross misrepresentation"" of the research.

The U.S. death rate from HIV was nine times higher in 1990 than it was in 2010, the latest year for the data.

Marshall cites a number of other studies that show homosexuals face certain health risks. But none of them focused on the life expectancy of homosexuals, and they certainly didn't conclude that gays die about 20 years earlier than heterosexuals.

We rate Marshall’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979F5140>],/factchecks/2012/jun/07/bob-marshall/bob-marshall-says-homosexual-behavior-cuts-life-ex/

Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) wrote a post on the liberal blog Blue Jersey on Monday criticizing Christie and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, both Republicans, for their lack of truthfulness. But in the process, she distorted some facts of her own.

""Politifact listed Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin as the Governor who told the most lies,"" Weinberg wrote. ""Well not to be [outdone], our own ‘untruthful’ Governor Chris Christie made it into Politifact's top five of ‘Lie - en Governors.’ We’re so proud Mr. Christie.  You should really put that accolade right under your ‘Jersey Comeback’ banner.""

This claim surprised us: PolitiFact New Jersey never compiled such a list -- and neither did any of our fact-checking colleagues.

So what is Weinberg talking about?

The state senator’s statement was based on a list posted on the liberal blog Uppity Wisconsin.

The list ranked governors fact-checked at least five times by PolitiFact by the percentage of True and Mostly True ratings they received.

Walker had the lowest combined percentage of those two rulings, according to the June 1 blog post. The post concluded that ""Walker is the #1 most dishonest governor in America.""

Christie took fourth place among the ""top five most dishonest governors in America"" with 38 percent of his PolitiFact rulings earning True or Mostly True.

The blog’s tally of percentages of True and Mostly True rulings for governors in its top five list was mostly accurate at the time, but there’s several problems with the conclusions made from that data.

PolitiFact Editor Bill Adair called suggestions that a governor is ""in the top five"" for falsehoods ""inaccurate -- and meaningless.""

Overall, PolitiFact has checked 22 sitting governors. Only 10 of those governors have faced the Truth-O-Meter at least five times.

In a pool of 10, it’s not difficult to land a spot in the top five.

""It's fine if people want to use our report cards to compare the records of people we fact-check. But it's important to be accurate about what those report cards say and what they don't,"" Adair said. ""The report cards provide a tally of the claims we chose to check. But it's not accurate to say the report cards indicate who ‘told the most lies.’ We are journalists who choose our fact-checks based on what is newsworthy. We are not social scientists and are not using any kind of random sample to select statements to check.""

Jason Butkowski, a spokesman for the New Jersey Senate Democrats, acknowledged Weinberg erred in citing PolitiFact as the source of the ranking, but, he said in an e-mail, ""that does not take away from the larger issue – that Governor Christie, who prides himself on his straight-talking Jersey guy demeanor, only scored truthful or mostly truthful an abysmal 38% of the time in the 37 statements analyzed by PolitiFact.""

Obviously, PolitiFact doesn’t track every statement, nor do they track every Governor on an even playing field, so issuing any kind of quantitative ranking of public officials based on PolitiFact’s information doesn’t work.  However, the people of New Jersey can, and should, expect more from Governor Christie when it comes to leveling with them on the big issues that matter most to our State.""

Our ruling

Weinberg claimed PolitiFact listed Walker as the governor ""who told the most lies"" and Christie made it into PolitiFact’s ""top five of ‘Lie - en Governors’.""

Weinberg is wrong on both counts.

PolitiFact never ranked governors by their falsehoods. Though PolitiFact breaks down ratings by percentages, those figures represent how an individual’s statements have fared on the Truth-O-Meter. They do not show who ""told the most lies.""

We rate Weinberg’s claim False.

"['Ohio', 'Jim Renacci']","
Jim Renacci says Betty Sutton has never held a town hall meeting with constituents
","
Since becoming a member of Congress last year, Rep. Jim Renacci has held numerous ""town hall"" style public meetings, even though he recognizes that hostile political entities are videotaping all his remarks in hopes that he’ll make a gaffe they can exploit.

A redistricting plan that eliminated two of Ohio’s congressional seats put Renacci, a Republican from Wadsworth, into the same congressional district as Rep. Betty Sutton, a Democratic from Copley Township,  prompting a November face-off. The upcoming contest has made both Renacci and Sutton top political targets.

In a news release announcing Renacci will hold a town hall meeting for Rocky River on June 14, Renacci’s re-election campaign chided Sutton for not holding such meetings herself, and claimed it was part of a ""disappearing act.""

""In a stunning and stark contrast, there is no record of Congresswoman Betty  Sutton, who has been in office for the better part of a decade, ever holding a single in-person town hall meeting open to the general public - and she certainly has never done so while running to represent the 16th District,"" the news release said.

Has Sutton really never held open meetings with constituents? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out the claim, particularly since it has seen news releases about town hall meetings that Sutton had scheduled during her three terms in office. For example, a 2007 release that’s still available online announced events in Akron and Elyria.

""Sutton will open the event with brief remarks, introduce her district staff, and spend the majority of the event responding to questions,"" the news release said. "" Those interested in attending and/or submitting a question for the Q & A period should RSVP to the email address below or contact either of Sutton's district offices in Lorain or Summit County.""

The Plain Dealer also published at least one article that mentioned Sutton conducting a town hall meeting. That meeting occurred in July 2009. At that time of the August 2009 article -  when opponents of proposed health care reform legislation were disrupting congressional meetings around the country - Sutton told The Plain Dealer that many of her constituents said they didn’t want to attend such a meeting because ""they would fear for their safety.""

Afterwards, she announced that she’d hold a constituent meeting on the subject by teleconference, and invited callers to dial-in.

In light of that evidence, PolitiFact Ohio asked Renacci’s campaign for the basis of its claim that there’s no record of Sutton ever holding a single in-person town hall meeting open to the general public.

Spokesman James Slepian responded that the campaign is certain that Sutton has not conducted such a town hall meeting since she announced her run against Renacci last year. He said Sutton had announced she’d hold a semi-public June 3 event in Renacci’s hometown  -  Wadsworth -  but canceled it.

An email to The Plain Dealer about the Wadsworth event indicated it was not a town hall meeting, but a fundraiser that a local Democratic party group had scheduled at a restaurant near Renacci’s campaign headquarters. The fundraiser was cancelled because of a scheduling conflict.

Slepian said the campaign was ""unable to find a clear record of her holding such an event at any other time during her career in Congress. And by clear record, I mean some record detailing when and where the town hall occurred, was it open to the public, did Sutton field questions from the audience (all the same information that is readily available about the town halls that Mr. Renacci holds regularly)."" Slepian accused Sutton of repeatedly announcing town hall meetings and then cancelling them, citing as evidence August 2009 posts from conservative and Tea Party websites that expressed disappointment that Sutton opted to hold a teleconference phone call with constituents about the health care bill instead of in-person meetings.

Slepian said the news release that announced the Sutton’s 2007 event did not constitute ""proof"" that it occurred, and he could find ""no record"" that the July 2009 town hall meeting referenced in the August 2009 The Plain Dealer article had actually happened.

""In addition to the clear differences in their respective voting records, another glaring difference between Jim Renacci and Betty Sutton is that while Jim Renacci believes he owes it to the voters to answer them regularly and in person as their voice in Washington, Betty Sutton feels no such obligation to the people of Northeast Ohio,"" Slepian said in an email.

Sutton spokesman Anthony DeAngelo said Sutton has recently conducted seniors listening tour events, which are open to the public, and where constituents can ask Sutton questions and offer comments.

""That’s what a ‘town hall’ is,"" DeAngelo said.

An article on the North Royalton Post website chronicled much of what Sutton said at an April 2 ""listening tour"" event that Sutton held at the North Royalton branch of the Cuyahoga County Public Library. The article, accompanied by photos from the event, said it was attended by ""less than a handful of seniors.""

To Renacci’s credit, he has held regular town hall meetings with constituents even as hostile videographers have doggedly recorded them. And his staff could have argued that they think he meets with constituents more often or that Sutton does not hold town hall meetings often enough.

But his claim that ""there is no record"" of Sutton ""ever holding a single in-person town hall meeting open to the general public"" does not stand up to scrutiny.

News releases that have announced such events and newspaper articles about those events provide sufficient evidence that they occurred.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Renacci’s claim rates False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A49AC40>],/factchecks/2012/jun/07/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-says-betty-sutton-has-never-held-town-/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz's claim that the head of the FBI told Congress 'they cannot vet those refugees' from Syria
","At the Las Vegas Republican primary debate, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, stressed the need to secure the border to keep out jihadists masquerading as refugees. ""President Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing bringing tens of thousands of Syrian refugees to this country when the head of the FBI has told Congress they cannot vet those refugees,"" he said Dec. 15, 2015, on CNN.   Is it true that Obama’s own FBI director, James Comey, said national security and intelligence officials can’t screen Syrian refugees? The Cruz campaign forwarded us a report on Comey’s concerns over a bill put forward by Republicans that would toughen the refugee vetting process. The bill would require Comey — and other top national security officials — to personally certify every single refugee admitted into the United States was not a security threat. Comey, appearing before Congress on Dec. 9, said he couldn’t. ""Could I certify to there being no risk associated with an individual?"" he said. ""The bureau doesn't take positions on legislation, and we don't get involved in policy decisions. But that practically would be impossible."" But that’s not the same standard Cruz mentioned during the debate. For the record, the United States can vet the refugees through a process that involves the FBI as well as the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and other agencies. The vetting process can take up to two years, in which refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. Comey has stressed, in testimony before several different congressional committees, that there are challenges (namely, information gaps) to how we screen the refugees, and that there’s no risk-free process. But, he said, we’ve gotten ""dramatically"" better at the task in the past few years. He never said that the federal agencies ""cannot vet"" refugees in as plain of terms as Cruz suggested. (Later in the debate, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie made a similar claim as Cruz about Comey’s remarks.) Appearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Oct. 8, Comey said, ""There is risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like that. From the intelligence community's perspective, as I said, I think we've developed an effective way to touch all of our databases and resources to figure out what we know about individuals. … I don't think that's a cumbersome process. My concern there is that there are certain gaps."" Comey made similar comments before the House Homeland Security Committee on Oct. 21 and talked about the information gaps in more detail. ""If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home but we are not going to -- there will be nothing show up because we have no record on that person,"" he said, adding, ""The good news is we are much better doing it than eight years ago. The bad news is, there is no risk-free process."" A day later, on Oct. 22, Comey repeated his comments before the House Judiciary Committee: ""We have gotten much better as an intelligence community at joining our efforts and checking our databases in a way that gives us high confidence. If we have a record on somebody, it will surface. That's the good news. … The challenge we face with Syria is that we don't have that rich  set of data. So even though we've gotten better at querying what we have, we certainly will have less overall. And so as I said to a question earlier, someone only alerts as a result of our searches if we have some record on them. That's the challenge we face with Syria."" Our ruling Cruz said, ""The head of the FBI has told Congress they cannot vet those refugees."" The Cruz campaign pointed to comments Comey made about how he cannot personally vet every refugee admitted to the United States (required by a House bill that seeks to toughen the admissions process). But the FBI director never said, as Cruz claims he did, that the government ""cannot vet"" refugees. Comey has said there are challenges and gaps to the process and that there are always risks to admitting people from conflict zones. But he also said  the process is effective and has gotten more so in the past few years.

Donald Trump exaggerates how much coal in U.S. has been phased out
","Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough broke from questions about Muslims and immigration recently to ask Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump about another issue: what he would do about climate change. Trump initially responded by saying he wanted clean air and water. When Richard Haass, Council on Foreign Relations president and a panelist on the show, noted those are environmental concerns not directly related to climate change, Trump went on to tout the ""many"" environmental awards his company had won for building projects. After more prodding, Trump said,""Remember this. We're practically not allowed to use coal any more. What do we do with our coal? We ship it to China and they spew it in the air."" A reader asked us to check whether this was accurate, so we took a closer look at Trump's full statement. Trump’s campaign did not reply to an inquiry for this article. ""We're practically not allowed to use coal any more."" There’s a grain of truth here, but it’s buried under significant exaggeration. In August 2015, as we’ve noted, the Obama administration announced Clean Power Plan regulations that would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. Advocates say the reduction would help ease global warming along with cutting emissions that create soot and smog. But the regulatory effort has alarmed the coal industry and its allies in Congress. ""This administration’s regulatory assault on coal has had the intention — and increasingly the practical effect — of taking coal out of the market,"" said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association. (The plan continues to be challenged in court.) Several factors — tighter government regulations, yes, but also lower natural gas prices, and changing consumer and industry preferences — have combined to reduce the amount of coal used for electricity generation by about one-sixth since 2008. But contrary to what Trump asserted, Popovich said, ""coal is not going away."" The U.S. electric power sector consumed 858.3 million tons of coal in 2013, the most recent full year for which Energy Information Administration data is available. It was a little over 1 billion tons in 2008, the last year before the most recent recession. Despite the decline, coal remains the single-most common source for electricity generation in the United States. In 2014, coal accounted for 39 percent of electricity generation, followed by natural gas at 27 percent, nuclear at 19 percent, hydropower at 6 percent, and other renewable sources at 7 percent. In its most recent future projection, the Energy Information Administration predicted that coal would maintain its top spot for electricity generation. Under the most basic economic parameters, coal would decline in future years due in large part to the retirement of aging coal-fired plants but would still account for 34 percent of energy generation in 2040. The enactment of policies that put coal at a disadvantage could drop that percentage further by 2040. Beyond electricity generation, 43.3 million tons of coal were used for other industrial purposes in the United States in 2013, and 2 million tons were allocated to commercial and institutional uses. In other words, coal usage may be slipping, but it’s still in wide use around the country and will continue to be a major source of energy for the next quarter century. ""We ship (coal) to China and they spew it in the air."" China is a major world user of coal, and scientists say its emissions are a major factor in climate change. But very little of the coal produced in the United States goes to China, so any change in United States trade policy would have little effect on China’s coal usage. According to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. exported 1.8 million tons of coal to China in 2014. That’s less than 2 percent of all U.S. coal exports for that year, which totaled 97.3 million tons to all countries combined. By comparison, the United Kingdom imports more than five times as much U.S. coal as China does. Germany imports more than twice as much U.S. coal as China does, and the Netherlands imports about seven times as much. U.S. coal exports don’t account for much of what China uses, either. While U.S. coal has been gaining market share in Asia in recent years, the Energy Information Administration reported, it comprised less than 4 percent of Asia's coal imports in 2012, and less than 1 percent of total coal consumed by the four biggest Asian importers, which are China, Japan, India and South Korea. And since that figure is for all four countries combined, China’s share is just a fraction of that. The major foreign coal suppliers to China include Australia and Indonesia, Popovich said. The United States’ exports to China are ""very small,"" he said. Our ruling Trump said, ""We're practically not allowed to use coal any more. What do we do with our coal? We ship it to China and they spew it in the air."" He has a point that the Obama administration has worked to reduce the amount of carbon emissions from U.S. sources, including placing additional burdens on power plants that burn coal. But Trump’s language vastly overstates his case. Despite recent declines in coal usage, electric companies in the United States still burned more than 850 million tons of coal in 2014, making it easily the most common energy source for electricity generation. Trump’s point about the U.S. shipping coal to China is even less accurate. U.S. coal exports to China comprise only a tiny fraction of all U.S. coal exports, and U.S. coal accounts for just a tiny fraction of all of the coal that China imports. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BD41C0>],/factchecks/2015/dec/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-exaggerates-how-much-coal-us-has-been/

Ted Cruz misquotes CIA official, makes false claim on bombing ISIS oil and climate change
","Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz tore into President Barack Obama’s strategy against ISIS in an NPR interview. Cruz, who vowed to ""utterly destroy ISIS"" and ""carpet bomb them into oblivion,"" said Obama is not serious about defeating the jihadists. The Texas senator brought up Obama’s former CIA deputy director, Mike Morell, to show how Obama has prioritized a green agenda instead. ""Mike Morell testified and told Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS' oil fields is they're concerned about global warming,"" Cruz said on Dec. 8’s Morning Edition. ""This is nonsense."" Is it true that Morell said the Obama administration refused to strike ISIS’ oil assets because of fears that emissions from oil fires will contribute to global warming, the term for increased temperatures believed to be linked to human activity? Not exactly. Cruz gets several details wrong, starting with what Morell said and where he said it. His overall point is misleading and, in the words of one expert, ""completely nonsensical.""    Bombs and black gold We’ll start with an overview of ISIS’ oil assets and what’s been bombed. ISIS has hijacked the bulk of Syria’s oil, which has become a major cash cow for the terrorist group’s operations. (Other prominent sources of revenue include taxation and extortion, sales of looted property, bank robberies, kidnapping ransoms and state-run businesses.) With about a half-dozen oil fields under its control, ISIS churns out an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day and makes $1.5 million to $2 million daily from oil sales. U.S. and coalition military forces have been trying to get at this revenue source by periodically targeting oil assets for over a year. From the start of the operation against ISIS in August 2014 to Nov. 13, 2015, airstrikes have damaged or destroyed 260 oil infrastructure targets, according to the Defense Department.   These strikes were initially aimed at easy targets like mobile refineries and storage depots, and not entirely successful, a Pentagon official admitted. So attacks were ramped up to focus on more sensitive targets like tanker trucks and wellheads. In October 2015, the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS launched a second campaign specifically aimed to cut two-thirds of the terrorists’ oil revenue. By Dec. 1, military forces had destroyed wells, processing facilities and nearly 400 ISIS oil trucks, according to Defense Secretary Ash Carter. ""We've seen the U.S. get a lot more creative and aggressive with its target list,"" said Matthew Reed, vice president of Foreign Reports, a Washington-based consultant firm specializing in Middle East oil politics. ""It has had to overcome a learning curve. It's still learning what to hit and where."" Misquoting Morell? Did a top CIA official admit that these attacks were limited because of climate change concerns? The Cruz campaign didn't get back to us. Our search of congressional transcripts did not turn up any instance of Morell giving congressional testimony on this point. Cruz could be thinking of comments by Morell on PBS’ Charlie Rose on Nov. 23. Here’s what Morell said: Morell: ""So prior to Paris, there seemed to be a judgment — I don’t sit in the Sit. Room (sic) anymore — but there seemed to have been a judgment that, look, we don't want to destroy these oil tankers because that's infrastructure that's going to be necessary to support the people when ISIS isn't there anymore. ""And it's going to create environmental damage. And we didn't go after oil wells — actually hitting oil wells that ISIS controls because we didn't want to do environmental damage and we didn’t want to destroy that infrastructure."" Rose: ""So we’re hitting oil on trucks."" Morell: ""So now we're hitting oil on trucks. And maybe you get to the point where you say we also have to hit oil wells. So those are the kind of tough decisions you have to make."" Cruz flubs Morell’s comments in a few ways. First, Morell was talking about oil tankers and wells under ISIS’ control, not ""oil fields."" That term can refer to the underground reservoirs of petroleum or the broader oil infrastructure sitting atop (i.e. refineries, tanks and other collection and transportation equipment). As we noted, military forces have been hitting some oil assets. Second, Morell made no mention of global warming. Instead, he said the oil tankers and wells were spared out of concern for ""environmental damage."" Based on previous comments by Pentagon officials and experts we talked to, Morell was more likely referring to oil spills and destroying the local environment. That’s a far cry from climate change. Limitations and concerns The attacks on ISIS oil have been limited by many concerns. But based on statements by Pentagon officials and experts, the list doesn’t include global warming. The first attacks, for example, were aimed at damaging, not completely destroying, mobile refineries and other equipment in order to keep the infrastructure intact for an ISIS-less future, not out of environmental concerns.   ""We'd like to preserve the flexibility for those refineries to still contribute to a stable economy in what we hope will be a stable country when the Assad regime is not in control anymore,"" a Pentagon spokesperson told reporters in September 2014, adding that the attacks may have actually caused some oil fires. Oil wells and tanker trucks were initially off limits in order to avoid civilian casualties, according to news reports. Even when these became fair game in October 2015, permanent destruction still wasn’t the goal. ""We have to be cognizant that there will be a time after the war -- the war will end,"" another Pentagon spokesperson said in November 2015. ""So we don't want to completely and utterly destroy these facilities to where they’re irreparable."" Experts told us this policy is humanitarian and tactical. Injuring or killing civilians or crippling the economy would be counterproductive to the goal of isolating the enemy from the local population, said Ben Bahney, an analyst at the RAND Corporation, a global policy think tank. ""The Pentagon doesn't care about ISIS' carbon footprint,"" Reed of Foreign Reports said. ""They do care about how airstrikes impact locals who are trapped inside ISIS territory. Because the potential for environmental and humanitarian disaster is so high, the U.S. uses precision strikes."" That’s precisely why bombing the physical oil fields themselves would be a ""terrible idea,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The ecological fallout, health hazards and permanently weakened economy would impact local people. ""If it were just global warming, we would obviously bomb them,"" he said. ""If you’re worried about climate change, you should be stopping oil production period. If you bomb the well heads, you prevent the oil from being extracted so that would actually help reduce emissions,"" Bahney said. ""Cruz’s claim is completely nonsensical."" The Cruz campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling Cruz said, ""Mike Morell testified and told Congress that the reason Obama has not bombed ISIS' oil fields is they're concerned about global warming."" We found no instances of Morell testifying before Congress on this point. He did talk about Obama’s ISIS strategy on PBS, but Cruz misquotes what he said. Morell said U.S. military forces spared oil tankers and wells — not ""oil fields"" — in order to avoid ""environmental damage."" Preserving the environment for the local population is quite different from global warming, which no officials have brought up as a deterrent from bombing ISIS. The U.S. military has been striking oil assets but it has limited those strikes out of concern for civilian casualties, destroying the oil infrastructure and doing damage to the local environment. If climate change was the Obama administration’s top priority, experts said, it would make more sense to bomb the oil fields. We rate Cruz’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A328EC0>],/factchecks/2015/dec/14/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-misquotes-cia-official-makes-false-claim-/

Marco Rubio says the states have always defined marriage
","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., doesn’t like the Supreme Court’s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, but he said he won’t work to overturn it if he becomes president. Instead, Rubio told NBC’s Chuck Todd, he would appoint Supreme Court justices who ""will interpret the Constitution as originally constructed."" Same-sex marriage is not a constitutionally protected right, and marriage laws have always been the responsibility of the states and not the federal government, Rubio said in an interview that aired Dec. 13 on Meet the Press. ""If you want to change the definition of marriage, then you need to go to state legislatures and get them to change it, because states have always defined marriage,"" he said. ""And that's why some people get married in Las Vegas by an Elvis impersonator. And in Florida, you have to wait a couple days when you get your permit. Every state has different marriage laws."" We wondered if Rubio was right that ""states have always defined marriage."" Rubio’s statement echoes critics of this summer’s Obergefell vs. Hodges Supreme Court ruling who say the specific issue of same-sex marriage should be left to individual states. Rubio has a point that marriage laws are largely the states' responsibility, such as the permit and license laws he noted. But states cannot make laws that violate the Constitution, and the June ruling legalizing same-sex marriage was not the first time the Supreme Court limited state regulation and, essentially, defined marriage. The most pertinent example is the 1967 Supreme Court decision in Loving vs. Virginia, which invalidated any bans on interracial marriages. The court decided unanimously that these bans violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. ""It is true that states have generally defined who can get married and the process by which it happens, unless those laws contradict the Constitution, as you rightly point out in the Loving case,"" said Jason Pierceson, a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Springfield and author of Same-Sex Marriage in the United States: The Road to the Supreme Court. ""States have primary control in many policy areas, but those powers are limited by the 14th Amendment."" Jane Schacter, a Stanford University constitutional law professor, showed us a few more examples of the Supreme Court overturning state marriage laws on 14th Amendment grounds. In 1971’s Boddie vs. Connecticut, the court found a Connecticut law requiring poor people to pay a fee to get divorced violated the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. Seven years later, in Zablocki vs. Redhail, the court overturned a Wisconsin statute barring fathers who were behind on child support payments from getting married. And in Turner vs. Safley, the court in 1987 said a Missouri statute barring inmates from getting married was unconstitutional. ""There is no unrestricted prerogative of a state to do whatever it wishes with respect to marriage, Constitution be damned,"" Schacter said. ""But it is always case by case."" Pierceson added that the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which passed Congress with bipartisan support, is another example of the federal government making a law affecting the definition of marriage. The law, which the court struck down in 2013, defined marriage as one man and one woman for federal purposes, such as tax provisions that take marital status into account. Marriage isn’t the only place where states make their own laws and then the Supreme Court can overturn them if they’re unconstitutional, said Kermit Roosevelt, a constitutional law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. For example, states run their own elementary education systems, but they cannot segregate their public schools because that would be unconstitutional. ""You can argue about whether (the same-sex marriage decision) has a firm basis in the Constitution,"" Roosevelt said. ""But it's not out of the ordinary just because it's a constitutional limit on state marriage laws."" Rubio’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling Rubio said, ""States have always defined marriage."" Rubio has a point that states are generally in charge of administering marriage within their boundaries. However, his statement implies that state marriage regulations were untouched by the federal government up until the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and that is not the case. There are numerous 20th century examples of the Supreme Court overturning state marriage regulations that it found to be unconstitutional, including the 1967 decision to invalidate laws banning interracial marriages.

According to Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio, not enough. ""Listen, I mean, there's three or four countries that are providing military force. And the rest are signed on on paper but are not contributing significantly to the cause,"" Rubio said in a Dec. 12 interview for NBC’s Meet the Press. ""The truth is the most important countries that need to be contributing, including men on the ground to fight, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan, other Gulf kingdoms, are not.""  We decided to look at whether Rubio is correct that only ""three or four countries"" out of more than 60 in the anti-ISIS coalition ""are providing military force."" We previously fact-checked a statement by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders that focused specifically on Saudi Arabia’s efforts in the fight against ISIS. He said, ""Instead of fighting ISIS, (the Saudis) have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.""

(Saudi state media trumpeted the participation, releasing photos of pilots who flew in the strikes and highlighting that the son of King Salman was among them.) Rubio’s statement is more broad. To get a sense of the bigger picture, we looked at data compiled by a group called Airwars.org, which tracks the international air war against ISIS using information released by the U.S. military and other sources, including coalition nations.     Clearly, the United States has been doing the vast majority of operations against ISIS in Syria and the lion’s share in Iraq. In the most recent month, other allies have accounted for just 6 percent of the airstrikes in Syria and 30 percent in Iraq. Such data is consistent with Rubio’s statement, though determining the exact number of U.S. allies taking a significant role in ""providing military force"" is tricky due to a lack of transparency among some of the countries that belong to the coalition. The Pentagon only publicly breaks down the data into U.S. and non-U.S. strikes in Syria and Iraq — not further by individual nation. In Syria, the list of U.S. partners has included Australia, Bahrain, Canada, France, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom, while in Iraq the list has included Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, said David Weinberg a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""However, some of those are only symbolic or largely out of date,"" Weinberg said. Weinberg pointed out a recent CNN report that quoted a U.S. military official as saying the Saudis and Emiratis are only launching about a strike a month, Bahrain hasn't dropped an airstrike since sometime in the autumn, and Jordan hasn't done so since August. Weinberg added that Canada ""has been in the process of pulling out, Belgium suspended its strikes in July for some time, and Denmark suspended its involvement from September 2015 until sometime mid-next year."" The non-U.S. countries with the best case for having taken a ""serious"" role in the air war, he said, include France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Australia. Based on media reports and other evidence he’s pieced together, each has conducted more than 1,000 sorties against ISIS, or several hundred air strikes. Most of these have been in Iraq rather than Syria, he said. The only additional countries that might qualify for this most-active category are Canada and Turkey, but both of these countries come with asterisks. In Canada, the newly elected government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged during the campaign to terminate its involvement in anti-ISIS airstrikes, though it’s unclear whether that phase-down has been fully carried out. As for Turkey, it has been launching a large number of airstrikes in Syria since the summer, but many of those were against Kurdish rebels and not against the Islamic State, Weinberg said. Chris Woods, the director of Airwars.org, cautioned that some other members of the broader coalition, including some with only modest militaries, have been providing auxiliary assistance that may technically fall beyond Rubio’s definition but are nonetheless valuable to U.S. interests. ""Italy provides vital in-air refueling for strike aircraft, for example, while Germany has just committed six Tornados for valuable aerial reconnaissance,"" Woods said. ""At sea, the Belgians are helping protect the French carrier Charles de Gaulle. And on the ground, a significant number of nations, such as New Zealand and Portugal, are helping train Iraqi forces."" To read more, see this summary from the Pentagon. Woods added that allied strikes have risen over time. Woods said there were more non-U.S. strikes in Syria between Nov. ,30 and Dec. 6 — 19 strikes — than in any week in the preceding year. By comparison, he said, there were 50 U.S.-only strikes in Syria that week. It’s also worth noting that Russia has been increasingly active in the air war, though it isn’t a member of the U.S.-led coalition. In addition, the extent to which it’s targeting ISIS rather than opponents of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad is unclear. Putting it all together, Weinberg said, ""it's true that a only a handful of countries other than the United States are launching airstrikes in Syria and Iraq on any sort of significant scale, but it's extremely hard to confirm for certain whether it's precisely only three or four at the current moment."" Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and head of its Intelligence Project, agreed. Rubio’s statement, he said, ""is correct if the question is who is putting boots on the ground or air power in Iraq and Syria against ISIS."" Our ruling Rubio said that only ""three or four countries"" out of roughly 60 in the anti-ISIS coalition ""are providing military force."" The available government data and media reports suggest that Rubio is close to accurate. However, a lack of transparency in the operational data leaves a measure of doubt, and stating it the way he did glosses over the contributions from other nations that are taking important support roles even if they aren’t contributing much in the way of airstrikes. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4B1E00>],/factchecks/2015/dec/13/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-appears-right-only-3-or-4-countries-ar/

The trouble counting Rhode Island's homeless veteran population
","The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development calls it a ""Point in Time"" count. It’s the number of homeless people counted on ""a single night in January,"" according to the agency’s ""Annual Homeless Assessment Report,"" which was submitted to Congress on Nov. 19. To get the tally, HUD works with local observers in each state to count homeless people on the streets, in shelters and in other locations. This year’s assessment, which reported an estimated 107 homeless veterans in Rhode Island, has drawn criticism from Operation Stand Down Rhode Island, a veterans advocacy agency, which says HUDs measurement is flawed and minimizes the numbers of homeless veterans in the state. A press release issued Nov. 19 by HUD’s New England region office in Boston provides a list of ""estimates"" on homelessness reported by state and local planning agencies in Rhode Island, including an estimate about the number of homeless veterans. ""On a single night in January 2015, 107 veterans were homeless,"" it says. HUD’s 75-page report cites the 107 number in several exhibits, including one table that shows just two of 107 homeless veterans living without shelter, a rate of 1.9 percent. This is lower than any other state, it says. The news release qualifies certain limitations of the data, referring to the data as a ""snapshot"" and saying that the number does not reflect who is eligible for HUDs homeless assistance grants programs. It says the ""point-in-time count only captures those persons sleeping in sheltered and unsheltered locations on the night of the count."" So the count reflects all homeless veterans in unsheltered locations that night? ""It’s not an exact science,"" acknowledges HUD spokeswoman Rhonda Siciliano. ""Obviously, going out and counting people on the street you’re not going to be 100 percent accurate."" Siciliano told PolitiFact that HUD’s counting method would probably generate two different numbers if it was done on two nights instead of one. ""It’s a very fluid situation,"" she said. ""People go in and out of homelessness."" Erik Wallin, executive director of Operation Stand Down Rhode Island, is among critics who say the methodology of the assessment significantly minimizes the actual number in this case. Wallin argues that many homeless veterans are unlikely to acknowledge their background when approached in a shelter or on the street. Some veterans known to the Veterans Administration are not known to HUD, he said. Wallin’s organization served 57 veterans who were homeless when they approached Operation Stand Down for help in January of 2015. Wallin says that homeless veterans who aren’t in shelters aren’t likely to hang out where other homeless people congregate. Wallin talks about one veteran who chose to live in his van as Operation Stand Down worked with him to find housing. Eric L. Hirsch, a Providence College sociology professor who coordinated the count, said he believes the assessment, which was conducted in the wintertime, did not miss a lot of homeless people who were living outside. ""If someone feels we did, they needed to document that,"" he said. ""If they had documented it and there was evidence of it, then they would have been included in the count."" The nature of homelessness -- a condition that many people cycle in and cycle out of -- can make it very hard to quantify the homeless over the course of a full year, especially in warmer climates where homeless people live outside year round. But for the same reason, the point in time approach might give the impression that fewer numbers of people are affected by homelessness. ""The point in time count is really a snapshot and shouldn’t be interpreted as a prevalence measure,"" says Dr. Thomas O’Toole, a physician who cares for Rhode Island veterans and also directs the Veteran Administration’s National Center for Homelessness Among Veterans. HUD’s definition of homelessness also affects the count. Some critics, including Wallin and Hirsch, also say the definition doesn’t include individuals who are forced to live with a friend or with a relative because they don’t have resources for their own home. Hirsch said he estimates there could be hundreds of homeless veterans living under such circumstances but HUD doesn’t count this segment of the homeless population due to concerns about who is voluntarily living with someone else and who is forced to do so. Hirsch provided one other piece of info to consider when evaluating HUD’s claim of 107 homeless veterans in Rhode Island on a night in January 2015. Rhode Island’s Point In Time count was conducted on Feb. 25, 2015. That’s not a night in January. Our ruling Some vocal critics, who are knowledgeable about the extent of homelessness in Rhode Island’s veteran population, question the usefulness and accuracy of HUD’s point in time count. They weren’t able to provide hard evidence, for example an alternative count based on logs or records, of more than 107 homeless veterans in Rhode Island in January of 2015. But while HUD’s press release describes how the point-in-time count works, calling it a ""snapshot,"" it could say more about the possibility that the count missed homeless veterans who might not have been in shelters. The claim is partially accurate but it leaves out important details. For that reason, the ruling is Half True.

Bryan Hughes mostly wrong about David Simpson voting for driver's licenses for 'illegal immigrants'
","Republican candidates for an East Texas state Senate seat disagree over whether one of them has voted for permitting driver’s licenses for Texas residents who lack legal permission to live in the country. State Rep. David Simpson of Longview emailed reporters a Nov. 30, 2015, statement saying Rep. Bryan Hughes of Mineola had slanderously charged Simpson with supporting licenses for illegal immigrants without delivering the factual goods. The two are competing for a chance to succeed Kevin Eltife of Tyler representing the Senate's District 1. Simpson said: ""I have always opposed driver’s licenses for illegal aliens."" Hughes disputed that in a Dec. 1, 2015, press release stating Simpson ""actually voted for driver's licenses for illegal immigrants."" Is that right? Some perspective: The Texas Department of Public Safety began requiring license applicants to produce government-issued documents affirming their legal residency status in 2008, and lawmakers voted to require as much in a 2011 special session. Before 2008, according to a July 2011 Texas Tribune news story, no proof of legal residency was required to obtain a Texas license or state identification card. Mindful that Hughes said Simpson, a third-term legislator, voted for giving driver’s licenses to immigrants, we reviewed Simpson’s legislative record. We ultimately found no direct votes by Simpson on licenses for immigrants. In contrast, he joined most House members in voting for the 2011 mandate that the state request proof of legal residency from driver’s license applicants, arguably a sign he wasn’t champing to ease the way for unauthorized residents to get licensed. Still, his vote on a 2013 House proposal leaves room for speculation about his consistency. 2011 In summer 2011, lawmakers moved to require the DPS to seek proof of legal residency from applicants for driver’s licenses by placing an amendment on a fiscal matters measure. At the time, the move was pitched as bringing Texas into compliance with the federal REAL ID Act, which says applicants for a driver's license must prove legal residency if they want to use the identification to get through airport security. See the agency's explanation of the requirement here. And on June 9, 2011, nearly every House member (including Simpson) approved the amendment to Senate Bill 1. House video reveals no debate of the matter after Rep. Charles Geren, R-Fort Worth, told colleagues the amendment ""addresses an issue of people getting Texas driver’s licenses that don’t live in Texas and it also allows the department to issue a license only for the length of time that a person is entitled to be here."" According to the House Journal, eight members, Simpson not among them, asked to be recorded voting against the amendment. Records show too Simpson voting against the overall fiscal matters proposal several times; those votes occurred on June 9, June 10 and June 28, 2011. By email, Simpsons told us he opposed the measure ""due to its accounting gimmicks—namely, the deferment of Foundation School Program payments and the speed-up of tax payments—and its misplaced priorities, not because of the license provision, which I supported."" He provided a copy of a May 2012 letter to House constituents stating that he ""voted for the amendment to add documentation requirements for driver's licenses"" but against SB 1 because it extended inequitable school funding, sped tax collections and used ""smoke and mirrors"" to balance the state budget. So, there are no votes by Simpson in favor of driver’s licenses for immigrants. But there does appear to be fodder for speculation about Simpson’s consistent opposition. 2013 In 2013, Simpson voted against successful House efforts effectively killing proposals that related to more residents possibly getting driving permits. We don’t know of an independent way of telling if those votes signaled a position on driver’s licenses. But on May 20, 2013, Simpson edged a step farther by voting in favor of one of the failed amendments, the Texas House Journal shows. An amendment to Senate Bill 1729 by Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, said that under the legislation, which generally authorized a pilot project enabling a few counties to update or renew driver’s licenses, a license should include ""any Texas resident driver’s permit authorized by law."" And what did that mean? In debate, opponents said Cook’s language related to unauthorized residents getting a driver’s permit. Similarly, Simpson and Hughes’ campaign each nudged, conservative advocacy groups characterized the amendment as opening driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. In a scorecard of the 2013 Legislature, for instance, the Young Conservatives of Texas said Cook’s amendment ""would have allowed for illegal immigrants to receive driver’s licenses."" We didn’t reach that conclusion. By email, Simpson told us Cook’s amendment ""in no way authorized illegal aliens to receive driver’s licenses."" Asked why he voted for it, Simpson said: ""I voted yes to the amendment because it would only include licenses or permits already"" authorized by law. In the House debate, Cook didn’t dispute that his proposal might legalize more drivers; he also stressed that another change in law would be needed for the envisioned driving permits to become a reality. And while his proposal drew 72 votes, with 67 members voting no, it still died because Cook offered the proposal during final consideration of SB 1729; at that stage, 100 House votes were needed to amend legislation. A few days earlier, on May 17, 2013, Cook rolled out a longer amendment to SB 1729. He described the longer proposal--which was shortly derailed on a parliamentary point of order--as identical to a committee-approved version of House Bill 3206 by Rep. Roberto Alonzo, D-Dallas. Alonzo’s unsuccessful plan called for state-issued driving permits for residents who lack proof of legal residency, also requiring recipients to obtain auto insurance. Under the proposal, every applicant would have to submit to fingerprinting and clear a criminal background check. Before his proposal was felled, Cook told House members the permits wouldn’t look like driver’s licenses and couldn’t be used as IDs to board planes or vote. ""We have a growing population of non-citizens driving every day to school, to church, to work, all without insurance,"" Cook said, posing risks to all residents. The same month, Hughes’ campaign pointed out, Simpson was on the losing end of an 87-60 House vote setting aside Alonzo’s amendment to another House measure authorizing the state to let public schools and driving schools give the driving test required to get a license. Before that May 21, 2013, action, Alonzo told House colleagues that under his amendment, schools could give driving tests to individuals who obtained resident driving permits, provided such permits were legalized. ""Texas has a problem,"" Alonzo said, with people driving without auto insurance or a driver’s permit. By phone, Alonzo told us he favors giving undocumented individuals an opportunity to legally drive in Texas and his 2013 proposal’s described permits could have nudged the state toward fulfilling that goal though, he said, it didn’t provide for full-fledged licenses. Our ruling Hughes said Simpson ""voted for driver's licenses for illegal immigrants."" No such vote occurred. In the clearest vote we could find, Simpson voted to make it harder, not easier, to obtain licenses when, in 2011, he joined nearly every House member in approving a new mandate that applicants for driver’s licenses be required to document their legal residency. But we did find an element of truth to Hughes’ statement. Simpson voted in 2013 for an unsuccessful proposal that could generously be interpreted as foreseeing a path to individuals living here without authorization getting resident driving permits, though significantly such permits as sought by Alonzo and others didn’t (and don’t) exist. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

David Simpson mostly right about his staunch opposition to driver's licenses for 'illegal aliens'
","Republican candidates for an East Texas state Senate seat disagree over whether one of them has endorsed, and voted for, permitting driver’s licenses for Texas residents lacking legal permission to live in the country. State Rep. David Simpson of Longview emailed reporters a Nov. 30, 2015, statement saying Rep. Bryan Hughes of Mineola had slanderously charged Simpson with supporting licenses for illegal immigrants without delivering the factual goods. Simpson further declared: ""I have always opposed driver’s licenses for illegal aliens."" We wondered. Some perspective: The Texas Department of Public Safety began requiring license applicants to produce government-issued documents affirming their legal residency status in 2008, and lawmakers voted to require as much in a 2011 special session. Before 2008, according to a July 2011 Texas Tribune news story, no proof of legal residency was required to obtain a Texas license or state identification card. The spat between Hughes and Simpson developed, we suspect, because Republicans who show weakness on illegal immigration can run into trouble, especially in a party primary. The two are both angling to succeed Kevin Eltife, R-Tyler, representing the Senate’s District 1. We can’t gauge how someone has always felt about an issue. So we limited our scope to signs of Simpson publicly opposing licenses for such immigrants--finding that while there’s room for contrary speculation, a little of it caused by his own ambiguous statement, Simpson was among the vast bulk of House members who voted for the 2011 Legislature’s mandate to the DPS, arguably a sign he wasn’t intent on ensuring that all residents access licenses. News stories Let’s start with what Simpson has said in public settings. Hughes’ campaign pointed out a July 21, 2014, Tyler Morning Telegraph news story quoting Simpson after he returned from a weeklong tour of the Rio Grande Valley. ""We do have a problem with drugs and warlords taking advantage of the situation,"" Simpson said. ""We have to require a fulfillment of promises to appear before immigration courts to enter schools. We need to determine the status of these immigrants and not put them in this limbo. They can get an education but not get a driver’s license. That’s not right."" What wasn’t right in Simpson’s view wasn’t entirely clarified. The story further quoted him saying: ""We do need to secure the border against crime and terror, in order to defend life, liberty and property. I welcome people to come. We need workers. We do need to limit our health care to emergencies and critical care to immigrants as well as citizens. What’s going on in emergency rooms is not right. We need to stop the freebies, and open the legal pipeline while continuing to secure the border."" To our inquiry about Simpson’s consistency, Luke Macias, a consultant to Simpson’s campaign, guided us to Simpson’s 2014 98-slide presentation based on the legislator’s border trip, which included photos of his travels and thoughts about border and immigration policy. Macias urged us to note the slide indicating Simpson thinks Texas should ""overturn the mandate to educate aliens who have entered the country illegally or who are still residents of Mexico."" A 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision, in Plyler v. Doe, required Texas not to deny public education to ""undocumented school-age children."" Another Simpson slide, titled ""Dysfunctional Policies,"" including this license line: ""We provide K-12 education, but students cannot receive a driver’s license:""  SOURCE: Presentation, ""A Sobering and Beautiful Week on the Rio Grande,"" David Simpson, June 30-July 6, 2014 (web link received by email from Luke Macias, general consultant, David Simpson Texas Senate campaign, Dec. 1, 2015) What gives? By phone, Simpson told us he was trying to stress his continuing belief in not giving ""handouts and privileges"" to immigrants living here without permission; those include driver’s licenses, he said. By email, Simpson noted accurately that while his presentation called for some changes--such as ending the public schooling of children in the country illegally--it ""did not advocate for giving driver’s licenses to illegals."" Our searches via the Nexis news database and through news stories published by the Longview News-Journal yielded no examples of Simpson previously offering an opinion on driver’s licenses for immigrants. Simpson’s legislative record Next, we took up Simpson’s legislative record. In summer 2011, lawmakers moved to require the DPS to seek proof of legal residency from applicants for driver’s licenses by placing an amendment on a fiscal matters measure. At the time, the move was pitched as bringing Texas into compliance with the federal REAL ID Act, which says applicants for a driver's license must prove legal residency if they want to use the identification to get through airport security.

He provided a copy of a May 2012 letter to constituents stating that he ""voted for the amendment to add documentation requirements for driver's licenses"" but against SB 1 because it extended inequitable school funding, sped tax collections and used ""smoke and mirrors"" to balance the state budget. So, Simpson backed the mandate that DPS check on each applicant’s legal residency. Two years later, though, Simpson cast a vote at least leaving room for speculation about his consistency on this front. That year, he voted against successful House efforts effectively killing proposals that related to more residents possibly getting driving permits. We know of no independent way of telling if those votes signaled a position on driver’s licenses. But on May 20, 2013, Simpson voted in favor of one of the failed amendments, the Texas House Journal shows. The amendment to Senate Bill 1729 by Rep.

Finally, we spotted no evidence of Simpson trying to legislate about driver’s licenses. In the 2011 session, Simpson authored or co-authored about 50 measures, none touching on giving or denying licenses. In the 2013 and 2015 sessions, Simpson authored or co-authored nearly 150 measures, none of them affecting driver’s licenses. Our ruling Simpson said he’s always been opposed to illegal immigrants having driver’s licenses In 2011, Simpson joined House members in voting for the change in law requiring license applicants to document their legal residency, which we take as a strong indication of his position. But there’s a hint of uncertainty in Simpson’s 2013 vote on a proposal offered in favor of unauthorized residents someday getting resident driver permits as sought by Alonzo and others, which importantly didn’t and don’t exist, and his ambiguous 2014 remark about driver’s licenses.

"['Terrorism', 'Virginia', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump's hyped claim that he called for rubbing out bin Laden in 2000
","Almost two years before the Sept. 11 terror attacks, Donald Trump says he urged the United States to eliminate Osama bin Laden. ""Remember that in ‘The America We Deserve,’ I wrote that book in 2000, I wrote about Osama bin Laden: ‘We’ve got to take him out,’"" Trump said during a Dec. 2 rally for his presidential campaign in Manassas. Trump rarely leaves a rally without saying that well before the Sept. 11 attacks, he was among the first to recognize bin Laden’s danger. We wondered whether his claim about the warning in his book is accurate. ""The America We Deserve"" was published in January 2000. Trump was considering a presidential bid that year, and the book laid out his views on an array of issues, including terrorism. Bin Laden is mentioned once in the 304-page book, in a passage criticizing then-President Bill Clinton for having an unfocused national security policy during an era when the U.S. no longer faced one central threat, such as the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Here’s what Trump wrote: ""Instead of one looming crisis hanging over us, we face a bewildering series of smaller crises, flash points, stand offs, and hot spots. We’re not playing the chess game to end all chess games anymore. We’re playing tournament chess - one master against many rivals. One day we’re assured that Iraq is under control, the UN inspectors have done their work, everything’s fine, not to worry. The next day the bombing begins. One day we’re told that a shadowy figure named Osama bin Laden is public enemy number one, and U.S. jet fighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan. He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later, it’s on to a new enemy and a new crisis."" The reference to bin Laden relates to the Aug. 20, 1998, U.S. bombing of his camps in Afghanistan and Sudan. Clinton said they were in retaliation for terrorist bombings earlier that month on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Clinton said the goal of the U.S. strikes was to ""disrupt bin Laden’s terror network."" In the next paragraph of his book, Trump wrote that the U.S. also was ""haphazard"" in early 1999 when it intervened with NATO in the Kosovo War. Again, Trump mentioned bin Laden only once in his book. He did not call on the U.S. to target the terrorist leader individually, or to wage a unilateral war against his al-Qaida terror network. In many of his speeches this year, Trump has gone a step further and said that he ""predicted"" bin Laden in his 2000 book. Trump didn’t make that claim in Manassas, where he was diverted by demonstrators in the midst of his comments about bin Laden and did not return to the subject after the protesters had been removed. Trump, in his book, described China’s emergence as an economic power as ""the greatest long-term challenge"" facing the U.S. and North Korea’s nuclear ambitions as biggest short-term ""menace."" He devoted a chapter to terrorism. Trump wrote that the U.S. ""must prepare for the real possibility that somewhere, sometime, a weapon of mass destruction will be carried into a major American city and detonated."" He acknowledged that this was not an original thought, noting that ABC-TV’s ""Nightline"" had aired a series of shows about the threat. Trump wrote that such an attack likely would be carried out through germ warfare. We tried to contact Trump’s campaign for this fact-check, but did not get a response. Our ruling Trump claims that in early 2000, almost two years before the Sept. 11 attacks, ""I wrote about Osama bin Laden: ‘We’ve got to take him out.’"" Trump’s book did not contain those words or their clear likeness.

He complained that the U.S. kept shifting its military focus between Iraq, bin Laden’s organization and Kosovo without strong results. The book says that if bin Laden was ""public enemy number one"" in 1998, then the U.S. should have spent more than one day that year on a retaliatory bombing mission against his camps that  bin Laden escaped.

Conservatives slashed the federal deficit 60%, group says in pro-Paul Ryan ad
","A national  ""dark money"" group ran a pro-Paul Ryan ad in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that credits conservatives for slashing the federal deficit. Conservatives? A Democrat has been in the White House since 2009 and Democrats have controlled the U.S. Senate for most of the time since then. Of course, House Republicans such as Ryan have played a key role in the federal budget. So let’s see what the American Action Network is talking about. The network’s ad The Washington, D.C.-based group, founded in 2010 by former Republican U.S. Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota, says it promotes ""center-right solutions to our nation’s challenges."" It is a so-called dark-money nonprofit in that it is not required to disclose the names of its donors. The group ran ads against Democrat Russ Feingold in 2010, who lost his U.S. Senate seat later that year to Republican Ron Johnson. The group’ half-page ad ran in the Journal Sentinel on Dec. 7 and 8, 2015 and is said to be part of a $3 million national campaign. The attention-getting photo at the top of the ad shows 26 older white people and carried this headline: ""What’s the top priority of the new leadership in Congress? Fighting for the conservative principles that keep America strong."" The ad also featured a picture of Ryan and urged readers to thank the newly installed speaker of the House for ""making America stronger."" It said the Janesville Republican is working with conservatives in Congress to ""rein in runaway spending,"" then made this claim: ""Under conservative leadership, Congress has reduced the federal deficit by 60 percent – nearly $800 billion."" Network’s evidence As a reminder, the federal deficit is the difference in a given year between the government’s receipts and its expenditures. That’s different from the debt, an accumulation of deficits that is approaching $19 trillion. To back its claim, the American Action Network compared the deficit in 2010 to 2015, citing figures from a gold-standard source, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. We’ll note that the federal fiscal year starts Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. For example, fiscal 2015 started Oct. 1, 2014 and ended Sept. 30, 2015. Here are the annual deficits during that period. Fiscal year Federal budget deficit 2010 $1.29 trillion 2011 $1.3 trillion 2012 $1.09 trillion 2013 $680 billion 2014 $483 billion 2015 $439 billion American Action Network told us it picked 2010 as the starting point because at that time, Democrats controlled the Senate and the House (as well as the White House), before Republicans took control of the House in 2011. Spokeswoman Emily Davis told us: ""Given Democrats' record and budget plans, does anyone honestly believe that the deficit would be the same today or better without Republicans leading the House?"" OK. But Democrats dominated the federal government during the period the group cites: Year Party in the White House Party in control of U.S. Senate Party in control of U.S. House 2010 Democratic Democratic Democratic 2011 Democratic Democratic Republican 2012 Democratic Democratic Republican 2013 Democratic Democratic Republican 2014 Democratic Democratic Republican 2015 Democratic Republican Republican So, it would be difficult to give total credit to the minority party for deficit reductions, which is what American Action Network does. Other factors more important When Obama said in his State of the Union address in January 2015 that the country has seen ""our deficits cut by two-thirds,"" PolitiFact National’s rating was Mostly True. Like American Action Network, Obama was correct with his figures. But his claim was more general, whereas the network specifically credited conservatives for deficit reduction. That not only is problematic in that Republicans had relatively little power compared to Democrats, but because the overall economy has a much bigger impact on deficits than governmental actions such as spending cuts do. Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us Republicans deserve credit for trimming increases in spending that would have been in place had Democrats maintained control of the House. At the same time, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was also approved by the Democratic-controlled Senate and by Obama. Experts also say the deficit has come down in recent years at least as much because of the improving economy, which drives tax revenues up and lessens spending on programs such as food stamps and Medicaid. Economist Alan Auerbach, director of a tax policy and public finance center at the University of California, Berkeley, told us the higher revenues -- especially from individual and corporate income taxes -- had a much bigger impact on deficits than any changes made by the Congress or the president. Obama, of course, and perhaps to a lesser extent GOP leaders in Congress, could claim some, but not all, of the credit for the improved economy. Our rating American Action Network said: ""Under conservative leadership, Congress has reduced the federal deficit by 60 percent – nearly $800 billion."" The deficit reduction is actually somewhat larger for the period cited by the network, 2010 to 2015. But for most of that period, Republicans controlled only the House. Meanwhile, Democrats controlled the Senate for nearly the entire period, with fellow Democrat Obama in the White House. And the recovering economy, boosting tax revenues, has played a greater role as politicians in bringing deficits down. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C1DE80>],/factchecks/2015/dec/11/american-action-network/conservatives-slashed-federal-deficit-60-group-say/
"['National', 'Education', 'Antonin Scalia']","
Scalia says most black scientists went to 'lesser' colleges
","Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is taking heat for comments he made from the bench that some are calling racist. While questioning a lawyer during oral arguments in Fisher vs. University of Texas, a case that has the potential to derail affirmative action across the country, Scalia suggested that the practice might actually harm black students by putting them into a scholastic environment for which they are not academically prepared. ""There are those who contend that it does not benefit African-Americans to get them into the University of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less-advanced school, a slower-track school where they do well,"" Scalia said Dec. 9. ""One of the briefs pointed out that most of the black scientists in this country don’t come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools where they do not feel that they’re being pushed ahead in classes that are too fast for them."" Scalia’s comments have generated plenty of discussion. As fact-checkers, we decided to zero in on his factual claim that ""most of the black scientists in this country don’t come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools."" Bloomberg pointed out Scalia was probably referring to a brief by University of San Diego law professor Gail Heriot and Cleveland attorney Peter Kirsanow. The pair are congressional appointees to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Their brief made the case that affirmative action is a hindrance for students admitted through affirmative action who pursue degrees in science and engineering."" As evidence they pointed to a 1996 Dartmouth study that showed 40 percent of black students graduating with science and engineering degrees came from historically black colleges and universities, where students typically have lower average SAT scores and high school grades. But Scalia’s comment was broader and talked about the number of black scientists as a whole. In that regard, there is no national count of every single black scientist and where they went to school. There is some research, however, on how minority students fare as science majors at different universities. On the raw numbers, the claim is ""likely to be true, but not for the reasons Scalia thinks it is,"" said Benjamin Backes, an affirmative action expert with the American Institutes for Research. Most black scientists likely did not go to schools like the University of Texas at Austin — that is to say, selective research universities. Why? Because the vast majority of students and science majors do not go to these elite institutions. For reference, the American Association of Universities represents 62 leading research universities, which together house just 20 percent of all undergraduate science, math and engineering majors in the United States and Canada. ""Because the typical student, both black and non-black, does not attend a selective university, the typical scientist likely did not graduate from a selective institution,"" he said. Let’s get back to the broader point of the statement: that black students perform better in science at ""lesser"" schools than the University of Texas. At the crux of this debate is the mismatch theory, which is controversial to say the least. It’s the idea that affirmative action brings minority students into universities where their academic credentials are significantly lower than the typical student, and so these minority students are less likely to persist with difficult majors like science and engineering than they would have been at a less-selective school. The study that Scalia cited is almost 20 years old, but more recent research purports to support the mismatch theory. ""Scalia was certainly oversimplifying, but there is a large literature on this problem,"" said Richard Sander, a University of California Los Angeles law professor who co-wrote a book titled Mismatch. Sander cited a recent study examining students in the University of California system that found ""minority students at top-ranked campuses would, on average, have significantly higher probabilities of graduating in the sciences if they had attended lower-ranked campuses.""  But — here’s a taste of how contentious this theory is — Matthew Chingos, an education expert at the Urban Institute, did his own analysis of the same data and found the results to ""only marginally"" hold up to scrutiny and that the relationship to affirmative action was weak. In his own book, Chingos found that attending a more selective institution makes it more likely that a black student will graduate. Following Scalia’s remarks, Chingos wrote in an Urban Institute blog that Scalia’s ""viewpoint withers upon closer examination"" because the theory has largely been discredited by social science. A group of 11 leading experts in quantitative social science filed their own brief to the Supreme Court arguing that the Court should not consider the mismatch theory when deciding the case. The professors wrote that research in support of the theory, such as Sander's findings, ""does not constitute credible evidence that affirmative action practices are harmful to minorities"" because of the ""significant methodological flaws on which it rests."" ""Essentially Scalia is presenting mismatch as fact without acknowledging the disagreement amongst researchers,"" Backes said, noting that he personally thinks there’s empirical support for the theory. A 2014 study, which does not take a position on affirmative action, found that an outsized portion, 30 percent, of black Ph.D. candidates in science and engineering attended a historically black college or university for their undergraduate education. Chingos said this study does not say much about the issue of affirmative action because it doesn’t say much about relative merits of minority students going to a less or more selective university. Our ruling Citing a brief, Scalia said, ""Most of the black scientists in this country don't come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools."" In terms of raw numbers, it’s probably true that most of the black scientists come from schools that are less selective than the University of Texas at Austin. But that’s not a statement on the effects of affirmative action. Rather, it’s because the vast majority of American college students, and thus most science majors, go to schools that are less selective than UT. Regarding the larger point — that black students fare better at ""lesser"" schools because their academic credentials are better matched to the curriculum — the evidence is mired in controversy. There is some scholarly research that backs up this point, but there is also scholarly research that refutes it. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C2D500>],/factchecks/2015/dec/11/antonin-scalia/scalia-says-most-black-scientists-went-lesser-coll/

Nash on target with Gwinnett population, staff data
","Some local governments, including Gwinnett County, are still dealing with the effects of the Great Recession. They’re planning to set aside money in their 2016 budgets to continue restoring programs and jobs that were slashed or frozen when the economic bottom fell out.   Gwinnett’s tax digest grew steadily until 2009 but lost 21 percent of its value by 2013, Gwinnett Commission Chair Charlotte Nash said Nov. 17. The digest is rebounding but isn’t expected to be back to its 2008 level until 2018, she said. So while Gwinnett’s population has grown 15 percent since 2008, the county government staff has only increased by 1 percent, Nash said. Could that be true? Since Nash is proposing a 2016 operating budget for Gwinnett of $1.1 billion and 82 new county jobs, PolitiFact Georgia decided to check First, a little background. The National Bureau of Economic Research, considered the official arbiter of U.S. recessions, identifies the Great Recession as roughly 18 months, from December 2007 to June 2009. The financial belt-tightening and pain was widespread, hitting families, communities and governments -- including the nation’s counties that collectively employee 3.3 million Americans. Georgia lost 340,400, or 8.5 percent, of its jobs, between 2007 and February 2010 and, consistently  reported one of the nation’s highest home foreclosure rates in this period. Gwinnett’s proposed 2016 budget would fund 25 police positions that were frozen and restore staffing at the county animal shelter, correctional facility and parks maintenance. It also would return library funding to 88 percent of its 2008 level and reinstate longevity pay raises that were eliminated in 2009, as well as pay for short-term and long-range needs, Nash said. Checking the numbers For our fact-check, we contacted Joe Sorenson, communications director for Gwinnett County government, who provided us with county population and employment data dating back to 2008. The population estimates show Gwinnett, once one of the nation’s fastest growing counties, still steadily adding residents -- going from 780,721 in 2008 to 898,450 this year and forecast to have 919,290 residents in 2016. County government added 42  authorized positions to expand its workforce from 4,893 in 2008 to 4,935 in 2015. The county would have an authorized workforce of 5,022 under the proposed budget. This includes 30 extra police officers, above and beyond the 25 newly unfrozen jobs, as well as additional positions in the district attorney’s office, animal control and welfare, parks and recreation, water and sewer inspections, and in a medical unit in the county’s Fire & Emergency Services Department.   So do the numbers we reviewed support Nash’s claim? The short answer is yes. The population estimates the county provided came from a private company and didn’t match exactly those we pulled from the U.S. Census Bureau. But the differences weren’t significant. (For example, the county estimate shows Gwinnett with 880,707 residents in 2014, the Census 877,822. Population estimates for 2015 also aren’t out yet from the Census Bureau.) Slow rebound Elizabeth Kellar, executive director of the Center for State & Local Government Excellence in Washington, D.C., said that, nationwide, local governments -- that includes cities, too -- cut about 500,000 jobs beginning in 2009. It wasn’t until 2013 and 2014 that local government human resources managers -- who the center surveys each year -- started reporting the trend turning from hiring freezes and layoffs back to hiring, Kellar said. Some county governments in metro Atlanta have smaller staffs today. For example, Fulton County government went from 6,866 permanent and non-permanent employees in 2008 to 5,229 in 2015, spokeswoman Jessica Corbitt said. That’s 1,637 fewer employees for a county that grew by more than 100,000, or about 12 percent in that period. DeKalb County didn’t grow on par with Fulton or Gwinnett, but also cut staff. Burke Brennan, county spokesman, sent us a graph, plotting filled full-time positions in county government each December from 2007 until this month. It shows the county currently has 6,057 full-time employees,16.3 percent lfewer employees than were on the payroll in 2007. Census Bureau estimates, which Brennan said should be viewed cautiously, show DeKalb’s population grew 5.3 percent, from 685,646 in 2008 to 722,161 in 2014. Our  ruling Charlotte Nash, chairman of the Gwinnett County Commission, said that, since 2008, the population of the county has grown 15 percent while the government staff has increased by only 1 percent. The former county finance director is right on her stats. The budget discussion in Gwinnett also serves a reminder that the Great Recession is not that far back in the rear view mirror -- not when a goal for 2016 is returning library funding to 88 percent of its 2008 funding level. We rate Nash’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978C5700>],/factchecks/2015/dec/11/charlotte-nash/Nash-on-target-with-Gwinnett-population-staff-dat/

Debbie Wasserman Schultz wrongly says Marco Rubio called for internment of Muslims
","Democrats are trying to link Donald Trump’s incendiary statements about Muslims to comments by other Republicans in the presidential race. Democratic National Committee chairwoman and South Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz bashed several GOP candidates, most notably fellow Floridian U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, in a Dec. 9 interview on CNN. ""It's not just Donald Trump that has said that Muslims are unacceptable for admission to this country,"" said Wasserman Schultz, highlighting comments about refugees by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie before turning to Rubio. ""Marco Rubio after the Paris attacks said not only that we should be considering internment, he actually suggested that maybe we should close down cafes and diners where Muslims gather, and in fact, compared them to the Nazi party,"" Wasserman Schultz said. Did Rubio actually say those things about Muslims? Our research shows Wasserman Schultz distorted Rubio’s recent TV interviews. We will explain each portion of her statement and why it creates an inaccurate picture of Rubio’s comments. Rubio has not called for internment of Muslims  Even the DNC admitted the ""internment"" part of her attack on Rubio is completely inaccurate. Rubio has not proposed anything similar to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II for Muslims. DNC spokesman Sean Bartlett claimed Wasserman Schultz had comments by Trump in mind during this part of her interview. In December, Trump told TIME magazine he wasn’t certain if he would have supported internment of Japanese during World War ll. ""I would have had to be there at the time to tell you, to give you a proper answer,"" he said. ""I certainly hate the concept of it. But I would have had to be there at the time to give you a proper answer."" Trump told Morning Joe on Dec. 8 that he wasn’t proposing internment camps for Muslims. But in an interview on Good Morning America, he compared himself to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who ordered the Japanese internment. ""What I'm doing is no different than FDR,"" Trump said. ""I mean, take a look at what FDR did many years ago and he's one of the most highly respected presidents. I mean respected by most people. They named highways after him,"" he said, referencing a highway in New York City named for the former president. When asked if he supports internment camps, Trump said no. These comments by Trump, however, don’t add validity to what Wasserman Schultz said about Rubio. Rubio on Muslim cafes and diners  According to Wasserman Schultz, Rubio ""actually suggested that maybe we should close down cafes and diners where Muslims gather."" Rubio did talk about closing down cafes in an interview Nov. 19 with Fox News’ Megyn Kelly, but Wasserman Schultz fails to mention a key qualifier. Rubio said any place should be closed down if it is a site ""where radicals are being inspired."" In the interview, Kelly asked Rubio, ""Donald Trump is suggesting we may need to close mosques that have problems with radicals at the top. What do you say?"" Rubio replied, ""Well, I think we need to target radicalism. A lot of it is actually happening online, not simply in mosques. The vast majority of the mosques in America is not..."" Kelly asked: ""But the mosques piece is a controversial piece, so where do you stand on that?"" Rubio then said: ""Well, I think it's not about closing down mosques. It's about closing down any place. Whether it's a cafe, a diner, an internet spot. Any place where radicals are being inspired. ""And that we have — the biggest problem we have is our inability to find out what these places are because we've crippled our intelligence programs, both through an authorized disclosure by a traitor, in other words, [Edward] Snowden, or by some of the things that this president has put in place for the support even of some from my own party to diminish our intelligence capabilities. ""So, whatever facilities being used, it's not just a mosques. Any facility that's being used to radicalize and inspire attacks against the United States should be a place that we look at."" Closing down any place if it is being used to ""inspire attacks"" is different from flat-out calling for shuttering cafes and diners simply because Muslims gather there. Nazi comparison  The last part of Wasserman Schultz’s attack is that Rubio compared Muslims ""to the Nazi party."" This is also a case of Wasserman Schultz twisting Rubio’s words out of context. Bartlett of the DNC pointed to Rubio’s interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week Nov. 15, the night after a Democratic debate. Stephanopoulos asked Rubio: ""You saw Secretary Clinton there did not want to use the words ‘radical Islam.’ What is your response?"" Rubio replied, ""I don’t understand it. That would be like saying we weren’t at war with Nazis because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi party but weren’t violent themselves. We are at war with radical Islam, with an interpretation of Islam by a significant number of people around the world, who they believe now justifies them in killing those who don't agree with their ideology. This is a clash of civilizations. ... Of course all Muslims are not members of violent jihadist groups."" Rubio was trying to use an analogy to suggest it would have been ridiculous to avoid using the word ""Nazis"" during World War II out of fear of offending some Germans who were members of the Nazi party. We emailed a spokesman for Rubio to ask if he had addressed this comparison again but did not hear back, and a Nexis search did not turn up other examples of him talking about this. Our ruling According to Wasserman Schultz, Rubio has said ""we should be considering internment"" of Muslims, and ""maybe we should close down cafes and diners where Muslims gather and in fact compared them to the Nazi party."" Rubio has not called for internment of Muslims. This is flatly wrong. Her paraphrases about Rubio wanting to close Muslim cafes and diners and comparing Muslims to Nazis are at least missing context. But to suggest he wants internment of Muslims — to take away their freedom and rights in the United States and separate them from the rest of society — is a grave accusation that leaves listeners with a grossly misleading impression of Rubio’s statements.

Until recently, pilots didn't use a weapon against ISIS in 75% of sorties, Jeb Bush says
","Former Gov. Jeb Bush blasted President Barack Obama’s response to Islamic State advances in Iraq and Syria, saying the White House has been creating too many bureaucratic hurdles for the military to clear. The Obama administration must ""take the lawyers off the war fighters' backs and let them go do the job and do it in concert with the neighborhood,"" Bush told George Stephanopoulos on the Dec. 6, 2015, episode of This Week. ""Up until recently, 75 percent of all the sorties that left the base came back without dropping their ordnances, because there was such a concern about making sure that there were no civilian casualties,"" Bush said. ""The United States will always adhere to the international standards of war, but this administration has imposed even greater challenges."" We wanted to check whether Bush was correct about airstrikes on Islamic State. Inherent Resolve The U.S. Air Force tracks how many individual flights, or sorties, are carried out for Operation Inherent Resolve, the campaign against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS or ISIL. They track weapons use during each combat sortie, which are counted separately from other flights like airdrops and refueling missions. Between August 2014 and June 2015, there were 18,042 combat sorties over Iraq and Syria, according to U.S. Air Forces Central Command. Weapons (guns, bombs or missiles) were used in 4,175 of them, or 23 percent. That ratio varies per month, but overall, weapons were not used in 77 percent of sorties. Some critics have used the statistics to say the Obama administration is not properly conducting its air campaign in Iraq and Syria. Defense policy experts told us that weapons use during sorties against Islamic State was low compared with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""There has never been an offensive air campaign in U.S. military history that has had anywhere near as low of an ordnance expenditure rate as has (Operation Inherent Resolve),"" Christopher Harmer, senior naval analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, told PolitiFact Florida. But the experts also said that the Obama administration had been making an effort to avoid civilian casualties as much as possible. This was in part because ISIS forces purposely try to blend in with civilians, and because the United States did not want to alienate the local population. ""We were perhaps overly concerned about collateral damage,"" said strategy analyst Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""I would say that we did allow ourselves to be over-restrained when dealing with the possibility of civilian casualties."" It is clear that Bush was right to use the qualifier ""up until recently,"" because weapons use has increased quite a bit since the summer as strategies have shifted. Special Operations forces have been called up to aid Kurdish and Iraqi ground forces, and the United States has begun targeting oil supplies controlled by ISIS. The Air Force told PolitiFact Florida that about 50 percent of all strike missions had one or more aircraft drop weapons in July and August. October was up to about 60 percent and in November it was 65 percent. That has increased the overall total or weapons use. Statistics through November 2015 show that out of 25,860 sorties, weapons were employed 10,932 times. That means since August 2014, aircraft engaged targets during a mission 42 percent of the time. There are several reasons weapons are being used more freely, according to a statement from Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles Brown Jr., Combined Forces Air Component Commander. Forces are gaining understanding of Islamic State tactics, and the coalition is sharing intelligence more effectively to improve targeting ability. Planes also have been on the lookout for targets of opportunity as they return to base after sorties. ""It’s the impact and the effect we have on Da’esh that we’re most focused on, not the amount of weapons released,"" Brown said in the statement. (Da’esh is yet another name for Islamic State.) ""The numbers are interesting, but the effect we have on Da’esh is what is important."" Some analysts agreed with Brown that weapons use statistics can be somewhat meaningless. Matthew Fay, defense policy analyst at the libertarian Niskanen Center, said in any case, the figures don’t convey whether the military’s true goals are being met. High body counts in the Vietnam War didn’t truly show America’s progress, he noted. ""If civilian deaths in American airstrikes in Iraq and Syria aid ISIS recruiting, increasing the percentage of ordnance dropped with no account for the collateral damage it will inevitably produce is counterproductive to American strategy,"" Fay said. Our ruling Bush said, ""Up until recently, 75 percent of all the sorties that left the base came back without dropping their ordnances, because there was such a concern about making sure that there were no civilian casualties."" That 75-percent rate was accurate until this summer, when sorties against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria saw an uptick, so Bush is right to qualify his statement. Experts said the Obama administration did want to avoid civilian casualties, but fighting an unconventional force like ISIS has made airstrikes more difficult than in previous conflicts. Analysts also noted that even at a low rate, citing weapons use as an indicator of achieving strategic goals does not necessarily signify success the way Bush implies. We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A45BF80>],/factchecks/2015/dec/10/jeb-bush/until-recently-pilots-didnt-use-weapon-against-isi/
"['Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan says U.S. tax rate for small businesses is 44.6 percent, versus 15 percent in Canada
","Shortly after his election as House Speaker, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis) spelled out his agenda for Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren. A key concern is tax reform, Ryan said during the Nov. 4, 2015 appearance on Van Susteren’s  ""On the Record"" show. ""We have to reform the U.S. tax code if we want to create more economic growth and more jobs,"" said Ryan, who was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee before becoming speaker. Ryan then dropped a stat that’s long been one of his key talking points, including when he was the GOP’s 2012 vice presidential candidate. ""The tax rate on successful small businesses is 44.6 percent right now,"" Ryan said. ""The tax rate on businesses in Canada is 15 percent. So we are taxing American businesses at a much higher rate than our foreign competitors are."" He made a similar claim Nov. 15, 2015, during an interview on CBS News’ ""60 Minutes."" That seems like quite a gap. Is Ryan right? Digging into the numbers PolitiFact National looked into a version of this claim made during the 2012 vice presidential debate, when Ryan stated: ""The Canadians — they (dropped) their tax rates to 15 percent. The average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world is 25 percent."" That claim was rated Mostly True. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of advanced industrialized nations, Canada’s central government corporate rate has declined from 29.12 percent to 15 percent. Businesses in Canada, however, also pay provincial taxes. The combination of the central and provincial corporate tax rates has fallen from 42.94 percent to 26.1 percent. Using the same data for the 34 countries examined, the average 2012 tax rate was slightly under 25 percent. The tax claim that Ryan made on Fox News was somewhat different. He cited the business tax rate in Canada, and compared it with the U.S. tax rate on small businesses, which he put at 44.6 percent. To support the claim, Ryan’s office cited a 2013 report by the Ways and Means Committee, ""Tax Revenues to More Than Double by 2023, While Top Tax Rates Hit Highest Level Since 1986."" That report puts the federal tax rate for small businesses at 44.6 percent. So Ryan’s right on that number. As for the second part of the claim, Ryan’s office pointed us to Taxtips.ca, a Canadian tax and financial information service. Tables on that web site put the federal tax rate in Canada at 15 percent, which, again, is what Ryan cited. The group says that provincial tax rates for business range from 16 percent in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island to 10 percent in Alberta. Scott Hodge, president of the Washington D.C.-based Tax Foundation, agreed that Ryan had it right, based on his group’s data. If anything, Hodge said, Ryan understated the gap between the United States and Canada. Citing Canada’s Revenue Agency, Hodge said that Ryan compared U.S. small businesses with the general business rate in Canada. ""The top federal tax rate for businesses is 15 percent. However, they do have a special small business rate of 11 percent,"" Hodge said in an email. ""Mr. Ryan was obviously referring to the main rate, not the special small business rate. That would make the differences even starker."" Our rating While arguing for tax reform, Ryan compared the difference in tax rates for small businesses in the United States  with the general business tax rate in Canada. He was right on both numbers. Indeed, if he used the small business rate in Canada, the gap would be even larger.

Trump cites shaky survey in call to ban Muslims from entering US
","Donald Trump turned to polling data to justify his proposal to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States. ""According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population,"" the Republican presidential candidate said in a Dec. 7 statement. ""Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing 25 percent of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad, and 51 percent of those polled agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to shariah."" There’s a lot packed into that quote, but we decided to focus on Trump’s claim that 25 percent of Muslims polled by the Center for Security Policy agree that global jihad justifies violence against Americans. While the study Trump cited does exist, it’s not at all clear that it supports his argument that ""there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population."" There are several important problems with the survey that call into question whether the results are representative of the entire U.S. Muslim population. Trump’s poll The Center for Security Policy, a hawkish think tank, surveyed 600 Muslims and released findings in June under the headline, ""Poll of U.S. Muslims Reveals Ominous Levels Of Support For Islamic Supremacists’ Doctrine of Shariah, Jihad."" Among the findings is 25 percent of respondents agreed either slightly or strongly with the statement ""Violence against Americans here in the United States can be justified as part of the global jihad."" About 64 percent disagreed. The first problem with the Center for Security policy poll has to do with methodology. It was an online, opt-in survey, which tend to produce less reliable samples because respondents choose to participate. In traditional polling methods, everyone in a population has a chance of being selected for the survey, meaning the results generally reflect the country’s demographics. Numerous respected polling groups, like Survey Monkey, use opt-in surveys, said Christopher C. Hull, a former adjunct professor at Georgetown University who now works with the Center for Security Policy and answered an inquiry from PolitiFact on the group’s behalf. He added that the method is useful for reaching small populations, such as U.S. Muslims, who only make up about 1 percent of the population. Hull did caution, however, that ""one cannot extrapolate directly from an online, opt-in survey to the broader U.S. population."" One notable finding buried in the full survey data: It found that 23 percent of the U.S. Muslims surveyed said they are ""not at all familiar with"" the terrorist group known as the Islamic State, and 18 percent said they are not familiar with al-Qaida. Experts said it seems illogical that such a large percentage of American Muslims would not have knowledge of the two groups. ""The al-Qaida number seems entirely implausible and likely a canary in a coal mine as to the unrepresentativeness of this survey,"" said David Dutwin, executive vice president and chief methodologist at SSRS, a research firm. There may be further problems with the poll, including the reality that many American Muslims are immigrants and not fluent in English, and that the survey asked leading questions with limited response choices, according to a critique by the Washington Post’s Philip Bump. It’s also worth noting that the head of the Center for Security Policy, Frank Gaffney, has articulated a variety of theories about Muslim extremists that verge on conspiracy, such as the idea that the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated the United States government and the false narrative that President Barack Obama is Muslim. Robert Oldendick, executive director of the Institute for Public Service and Policy Research at the University of South Carolina, reviewed the survey methodology made available by the Center for Security Policy but said he still didn’t have enough information to assess whether it’s a good or bad poll. The group has not disclosed how the surveyors targeted participants and what the response rate was. ""I would view these results very cautiously,"" Oldendick said. ""It may be right, but it may not be. But the information to identify the quality of the sample is just not there."" Compared with Pew Trump also mentioned research by the Pew Research Center as support for his proposal. On a key point, the results of the Center for Security Policy study diverge from the results of a 2011 Pew Research study, a traditional telephone survey of 1,033 U.S. Muslims. The methodology of the Pew poll, and the organization’s reputation, is considered solid by public-opinion experts. The Pew survey asked whether ""suicide bombing/other violence against civilians is justified to defend Islam from its enemies."" Just 1 percent said it is ""often"" justified, while 12 percent said it is ""sometimes"" or ""rarely"" justified. Eighty-one percent said it is ""never"" justified. According to Pew in 2011, about 13 percent of American Muslims said they believe that violence in the name of Islam is justifiable. That’s half the rate of the Center for Security Policy finding of 25 percent. The 2011 Pew study also found that a ""significant minority"" -- 21 percent -- of American Muslims feel that there is a great deal or a fair amount of support for extremism in the American Muslim community. The Center for Security Policy survey results do not directly back up Trump’s proposal to stop Muslims from entering the United States, said Kellyanne Conway, president of the Polling Company, which conducted the survey on the center’s behalf. ""We did not -- nor would we -- ask whether the U.S. should ban all Muslims,"" she said. The Center for Security Policy poll has touched a nerve because it ""asked questions that other polling firms are refusing to ask,"" Hull said, defending the results. ""When people do not like the results of a poll, they attack the poll’s methodology and sponsor,"" he said. ""This situation is no different."" Our ruling Trump said that 25 percent of U.S. Muslims ""agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad."" Trump is referring to a poll conducted by the Center for Security Policy. However, polling experts raise numerous questions about the validity of the poll’s results, including its ""opt-in"" methodology and the dubiously large percentages of respondents who said they were unaware of ISIS or al-Qaida. Moreover, an official with the Center for Security Policy cautioned against generalizing the poll results to the entire Muslim-American community. Another survey, which experts consider credible, found levels about half as high as what the Center for Security Policy poll found. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809706DEC0>],/factchecks/2015/dec/09/donald-trump/trump-cites-shaky-survey-call-ban-muslims-entering/

No, a college ID does not show Barack Obama was a foreign student at Columbia University
","President Barack Obama is about to enter his eighth and final year in the Oval Office, but some people are still trying to say he was never eligible for that job in the first place. Other conspiracy theories focus on Obama’s birth certificate (which isn’t a fake). This one uses his, ahem, totally real college ID to make the case that Obama was foreign-born. A reader recently asked us via snail mail to look into a post he saw on Facebook showing the purported Columbia University student ID of Barry Soetoro — aka Barack Obama. The ID lists Soetoro as a foreign student. This image has been around for a few years now. Here’s a 2013 post from ""Tea Party United."" 

Other Internet debunkers have looked at this before (Snopes, for one), but we wanted to take our own look. It may not surprise you that it’s a sham. Sorting out Soetoro There was a time when Obama used the last name ""Soetoro."" Obama used Soetoro, the last name of his stepfather, while he was growing up in Indonesia. At age 10, Obama moved back to Hawaii, his birthplace, and stopped using that last name. After two years at Occidental College in California, 20-year-old Barack Obama transferred to Columbia University in New York in 1981. There are no records that suggest Obama ever went by his childhood alias while attending Columbia. In 1983, the university’s weekly magazine published an essay written by Obama. The byline reads ""Barack Obama."" ID issues Whoever took the time to make this image apparently didn’t take the extra time to change the number on the card. After the card made the initial rounds, Snopes revealed the card number belonged to another student, who appears to be caught up in this simply because he posted his card to the web in 1998.

The picture of Obama on the fake ID is definitely not of the president as a young college student. It looks like the photo was taken in 1999, when Obama was in his late 30s and a state senator in Illinois.  What’s more convincing is Columbia University didn’t even start using digital ID cards until 1996 — 13 years after Obama graduated. ""This is a fake,"" said Robert Hornsby, a spokesman for the university, to PolitiFact. ""We didn't even have such IDs then."" Finally, Obama’s ID would not have said ""foreign student,"" and not just because Obama was born in Hawaii. Hornsby said Columbia doesn’t even label student IDs like that. Our ruling  A Facebook post makes ridiculous claims about a Columbia University ID that shows Obama was a foreign student who went by the alias ""Barry Soetoro."" The post wants you to believe Obama isn’t really an American citizen. But the ID, and the birther narrative behind it, is not valid. Obama stopped using his stepfather’s last name when he was 10. Columbia University didn’t even start using these types of IDs until the mid 1990s, long after Obama graduated. The ID is a pretty bad Photoshop job. We rate the claim Pants on Fire! Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the name of Columbia University spokesman Robert Hornsby.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097315F00>],/factchecks/2015/dec/09/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-still-claim-obama-wasnt-born-us/
