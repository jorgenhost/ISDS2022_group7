Has vaping 'wiped out' progress on reducing youth smoking, as Tim Kaine says?
","U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine says his effort to raise the age for buying tobacco products from 18 to 21 is aimed at lowering teen use of e-cigarettes. ""The e-cigarette vaping phenomenon has wiped out all the progress we’ve made on reducing youth smoking,"" he said during a May 29 radio interview on The John Fredericks Show in Portsmouth. We fact-checked whether the battery-powered gadgets really have erased gains in cutting teen smoking. Katie Stuntz, Kaine’s press secretary, said the senator’s statement was based on a February report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on tobacco product use since 2011 by middle and high school students. The CDC concluded, ""A considerable increase in e-cigarette use among U.S. youths, coupled with no change in use of other tobacco products during 2017-2018, has erased recent progress in reducing overall tobacco product use among youths."" The CDC conducts an annual survey of tobacco use by middle and high school students, asking if they’ve used a tobacco product in the last 30 days. The most recent poll, released in February, found middle school use increased from 5.6% in 2017 to 7.2% in 2018; among high school students, it surged from 19.6% in 2017 to 27.1% last year. Almost all of the increase comes from e-cigarettes. Among middle school students, use rose from 3.3% in 2017 to 4.9% last year. Use nearly doubled among high schoolers, from 11.7% in 2017 to 20.8% in 2018. We need to refine the statistics to examine Kaine’s statement. The CDC figures we've cited compare vaping to all tobaco use, including snuff and chewing products. The senator said e-cigarette use has wiped out progress in cutting youth smoking. To make the proper comparison, we must compare e-cigarettes use to only smokable tobacco products. There has been success in reducing youth smoking. In 2011, 6.4% of middle school students said they had smoked in the last 30 days; that dropped to 3.3% last year. During the same span, e-cigarette use increased eight times over, from 0.6% in 2011 to 4.9% last year. Among high schoolers, 21.9 percent were smokers in 2011, dropping to 13.9 percent last year. But e-cigarette use soared during the same span, from 1.5 percent in 2011 to 20.8 percent last year. In high schools, e-cigarettes overtook smoking in 2014 as the most popular use of tobacco; the same happened in middle school a year later. Has their rise erased progress in curbing youth smoking, as Kaine says? Let’s make a few calculations, applying the CDC’s percentages to U.S. public and private high school populations compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics. The CDC report, as we’ve mentioned, begins measuring in 2011. That year, about 3.5 million high schoolers said they’d smoked in the last 30 days, dropping to 2.3 million last year. In 2011, about 240,000 said they’d used e-cigarettes in the last month, and that surged to 3.5 million last year. In other words, the number of high school smokers dropped by 1.2 million, while those using e-cigarettes rose by almost 3.5 million. That more than wipes out progress in reducing smoking during the last seven years. But Kaine, during his radio interview, didn’t cite the CDC report, nor give a starting date for his claim. And if you go back 20 years or more to begin measuring, progress reappears.  In 1997, 36.4% of high schoolers - 5.2 million students - said they’d smoked at least one cigarette during the last 30 days. That outweighs the 27.1% - or 4.5 million students - who reported using any tobacco product last year. We should note that some studies have found e-cigarettes to be less harmful to health than cigarette smoking because they don’t emit noxious fumes. Researchers, however, are still studying the long-term effects of vaping. The surgeon general warns that most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which is addictive and can harm adolescent brains. Kaine has sponsored a bill with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that would raise the age for buying tobacco products.  The measure has been referred to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Our ruling Kaine said, ""The e-cigarette vaping phenomenon has wiped out all the progress we’ve made on reducing youth smoking."" The senator’s office told us he was referring to a recent CDC report showing since 2011, the growth in e-cigarette use among middle and high schoolers has far exceeded the decrease in smoking. The rise in vaping between 2017 and 2018 - the last two years of the survey - is especially eye opening. But in making his comments, Kaine did not cite the CDC report nor give a starting date for his measurement. And if you go back two decades or more, there’s still been progress in curbing youth tobacco use. So we rate Kaine’s statement Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2019/jun/12/tim-kaine/has-vaping-wiped-out-progress-reducing-youth-smoki/
"['Women', 'Texas', 'Greg Abbott']","
Did people lie about the maternal mortality rate in Texas, as Abbott said?
","For two years, data suggested that the rate of pregnancy-related deaths in Texas was at shocking levels, higher than in every other state and in much of the developed world. The data, reported by the state and published in a 2016 study, turned out to be wrong. A new look at the figures in 2018 found that the Texas maternal mortality rate was lower than reported, due in large part to errors with data entry on death certificates. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, sounded off on this in a tweet Sunday, linking to a news article from last year discussing the inaccurate state data.   ""Turns out the critics of the Texas maternal mortality rate were just lying,"" Abbott said. ""It’s less than half of what the critics said. It’s about 1/10 of 1%. Still, Texas has done more than ever to reduce that rate even more."" ""Facts matter,"" he added. Abbott is right about that last part, but less-so about the rest. The figures he included in the tweet reflect the new data, but it’s flat wrong to say that people who criticized the state’s maternal mortality rate were ""just lying."" The article Abbott shared in his tweet directly refutes his claim. Multiple reports, including one published by a state health agency, show that flawed state data suggested that the rate of maternal mortality in Texas was higher than the rest of the country. The error was not revealed until 2018. Abbott’s office did not return a request for comment. Study from 2016 showed shocking figures In 2016, researchers from the University of Maryland published a study in Obstetrics & Gynecology that looked at the rate of pregnancy-related deaths across the country by using vital statistics recorded by each state. The study found that in 2010 there were roughly 19 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in Texas, a number that jumped to about 36 per 100,000 births in 2014, reaching ""levels not seen in other U.S. states."" The World Health Organization defines maternal deaths as when a woman dies while she is pregnant or within 42 days of giving birth. A late maternal death is when a woman dies within one year of giving birth. The authors of the study expressed some skepticism about the results and said, ""in the absence of war, natural disaster, or severe economic upheaval, the doubling of a mortality rate within a 2-year period in a state with almost 400,000 annual births seems unlikely."" They noted that a future study would help make sense of ""this unusual finding."" After the study’s release, state lawmakers met for a regularly scheduled legislative session in 2017 and passed several measures aimed at curbing the rate of maternal deaths, including a bill to give mothers access to postpartum depression screenings and counseling when taking their children to the doctor for checkups. Lawmakers left the regular session without passing legislation to ensure that the state’s Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force could continue operating. Abbott called lawmakers back to the Capitol for a special session to address the issue (among many others). He signed into law a bill to extend the task force’s lifespan in August of 2017. When lawmakers left the Capitol after this year’s legislative session, they did so without passing the top recommendation issued by the task force: giving women access to health care coverage through Medicaid for a full year after they give birth. Under current law, women lose health care coverage through Medicaid two months after delivery. Revised study revealed errors In April 2018, researchers with the Texas Department of State Health Services published a new study that showed the actual number of maternal deaths in the state in 2012 was ""less than half the number previously reported."" Instead of the 36 deaths per 100,000 live births recorded in the original study, researchers said the real rate was more like 14.6 per 100,000 births in 2012. What accounted for the difference? Errors in data collection on death certificates. ""The study shows dozens of women were identified on their death certificates as being pregnant at the time of their deaths, when they were not,"" reads a news release about the 2018 study. ""The misclassification most likely occurred because people certifying the deaths selected the wrong pregnancy option in the electronic system used to register deaths."" This was a significant problem between 2010 and 2012 because the proportion of death certificates submitted electronically across the state increased by more than 40% during that same period, according to state researchers. Researchers found that these misclassifications resulted in an exaggerated maternal mortality rate because traditional methods for calculating maternal deaths, ""relies solely on cause of death codes from death certificates."" State researchers found a more accurate figure for the rate of pregnancy-related deaths by looking at death codes and cross referencing them with state records of births and fetal deaths. They also reviewed autopsy reports and looked for evidence of pregnancies. Our ruling Abbott said in a tweet, ""Turns out the critics of the Texas maternal mortality rate were just lying. It’s less than half of what the critics said. It’s about 1/10 of 1%."" While the figures in Abbott’s tweet are right — the state’s maternal mortality rate is about 14.6 deaths per 100,000 births — the idea that people ""were just lying"" when citing reports from 2016 on the state’s maternal death rate is inaccurate. This characterization struck us as the key point in Abbott’s tweet, which is why we rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",/factchecks/2019/jun/11/greg-abbott/abbott-maternal-mortality-texas-critics-lying/

Bernie Sanders oversimplifies record on Hyde Amendment
","The Hyde Amendment is statutory language that bars federal dollars from being used to pay for most abortions. Though decades old, it suddenly became a point of controversy in the 2020 presidential campaign, as rivals of Joe Biden criticized his history of voting for it. The Hyde Amendment was named for its original champion, the late Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and has been passed by Congress regularly since 1977. It says the federal government can’t pay for abortions, but it has always included an exception for the life of the mother, and most of the time it has included exceptions for rape and incest as well. Opponents of abortion rights have made maintaining the Hyde Amendment a longstanding priority. Now, those who favor abortion rights are prioritizing its repeal. The criticism from rivals in June 2019 drove Biden to change his position. On June 6, Biden announced that – like the rest of the Democratic presidential field – he now opposes the policy. One of Biden’s presidential primary opponents, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., took to Twitter to tout his position against the Hyde Amendment. Sanders tweeted on June 6: ""If we believe that a woman has the constitutional right to control her own body, that right must apply to ALL women, including low-income women. That is why I have consistently voted against the Hyde Amendment and why, as president, I would eliminate it."" If we believe that a woman has the constitutional right to control her own body, that right must apply to ALL women, including low-income women. That is why I have consistently voted against the Hyde Amendment and why, as president, I would eliminate it. A reader wrote us to suggest we check into Sanders’ assertion that ""I have consistently voted against the Hyde Amendment."" When we looked, we found that the story is more complicated than Sanders indicated. The Hyde Amendment is usually inserted into the yearly bills that fund the Department of Health and Human Services. As a result, Biden (who served as a Democratic senator from Delaware between 1973 and 2009) and other members of Congress were confronted with legislation containing the amendment on many occasions. The key factor that Sanders’ tweet obscures is that the Hyde Amendment usually isn’t voted on as a standalone bill. More often, it’s included in massive appropriations bills. In some cases, voting no on these big spending bills risks a government shutdown. In general, Sanders has indeed voted the pro-abortion-rights way on bills and amendments specific to the Hyde Amendment. But he’s often voted for the final spending measures that included the Hyde language. ""Large bills always contain lots of items a particular lawmaker might not like, but they are usually unwilling to sink the entire bill to prevent the enactment of one provision,"" said Josh Ryan, a political scientist at Utah State University who studies congressional procedure. A good illustration can be seen in a pair of votes Sanders took in 1993, when he was serving in the House. In one case that year, the House voted 255-178 to specifically keep the Hyde Amendment in the relevant spending bill. Sanders voted no, at a time when a large number of Democrats – 98 – were joining most Republicans in voting to keep the amendment on the books. Despite this, Sanders voted on behalf of the final version of the spending bill. The measure passed by a 305-124 margin, with 237 Democrats supporting it. Sanders’ campaign cited several occasions in which he has voted with the abortion-rights side on a specific Hyde Amendment bill – in the 1993 example cited above, plus additional measures in 1997, 2001, 2009, and 2019. When we reviewed appropriations votes going back to 1999, however, we found numerous occasions in which Sanders backed the final version of a spending bill that funded the Department of Health and Human Services, all of which included language enacting the Hyde Amendment. As a senator, Sanders voted for such bills for fiscal years 2016, 2014, 2013, 2010, 2008, 2007, and 2006, when the bill passed by unanimous consent by all senators. As a House member, he voted for such bills for fiscal years 2005, 2002, 2001, and 1999. ""Democrats tend to support"" spending bills for HHS, said University of Miami political scientist Gregory Koger, another congressional specialist. ""For a Democrat who supports social welfare but is also pro-choice, I think they have made peace with some version of Hyde language and just try to resist encroachment."" Sanders’ voting discrepancy caught the eye of CNN host Dana Bash. When she interviewed Sanders on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on June 9, she asked Sanders, ""You said this week that you have ‘always voted against the Hyde Amendment.’ But you have actually voted in the past to support large spending bills that include the Hyde Amendment. Is it misleading, Senator, to say that you have never voted for it?"" Sanders responded by saying that sometimes ""in a large bill, you have to vote for things you don't like. But I think my record as being literally 100 percent pro-choice is absolutely correct. Look, if you believe, as I do, that a woman's right to control her own body is a constitutional right, then that must apply to all women, including low-income women. That is what I have always believed, and that is what I believe right now."" Sanders’ campaign told PolitiFact that the senator has consistently received strong voting scores from abortion rights groups. These scores generally factor in votes taken on measures specific to the Hyde Amendment, but not the broader spending bills that happen to include the Hyde language. Sanders has frequently been given a 100 percent rating from both NARAL Pro-Choice America and a zero from the National Right to Life Committee. Sanders tweeted, ""I have consistently voted against the Hyde Amendment."" Sanders’ comments suggest a purity on the issue that isn’t possible for senators who want to vote in favor of major spending bills to fund the government. He has a point that when the Hyde Amendment has come up as a stand-alone measure, he has voted with the pro-abortion-rights side. However, Sanders left out that he has voted numerous times for broad spending bills that included a version of the Hyde Amendment. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2019/jun/11/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-oversimplifies-record-hyde-amendmen/

De Blasio claims city helped people out of poverty
","As he runs for president, Bill de Blasio emphasizes his record as New York City mayor, trying to make the case that he is prepared to take on difficult issues as president. During an appearance on ""Morning Joe"" on MSNBC, de Blasio was asked about income inequality in New York City. ""We’ve made a huge amount of progress in New York,"" he said. ""We’ve lifted hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty in the last five years.""  De Blasio is asking Democratic primary voters to consider his record as evidence of his effectiveness, and we wondered, have ""hundreds of thousands of people"" in New York City been lifted out of poverty in the last five years, as he claims? We approached his campaign for evidence of his claim, and spokeswoman Olivia Lapeyrolerie provided us with a report from the city. The report, released in May, is the New York City Government Poverty Measurement 2017, which is prepared by the Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity.   The report originated a decade ago under then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In 2008, using a proposal from the National Academy of Sciences, the city developed a more comprehensive methodology for measuring poverty. It measures poverty differently than the U.S. Census Bureau's official poverty measure. By accounting for more costs of living -- such as housing, child care and medical expenses -- the city found more people living in poverty than the federal government reported, both when the measure began and in the city’s most recent report. Bloomberg’s efforts ""created a far more realistic view of life in the city,"" the New York Times’ editorial board wrote in 2008. The standards and methods set during the Bloomberg administration have continued under de Blasio, according to Kristin Morse, who worked on the poverty measure under Bloomberg and now is executive director of The New School’s Center for New York City Affairs. ""I don’t think there is any question that this is an effective way to measure poverty,"" Morse said.   The city’s methodology also counts as income the value of benefits such as food and heating assistance.   The city this year reported there were 236,500 fewer people in poverty or near poverty in 2017 than if the poverty rate remained at the 2013 level. De Blasio took office in 2014. The percentage of New Yorkers in poverty declined from 20.7 percent in 2013 to 19 percent in 2017, according to the city. That's roughly 140,000 fewer people in poverty, using the city's definition of poverty. Declines were evident across demographic subgroups, such as race and ethnicity, educational attainment and geography, but not all subgroups. The poverty rate between 2013 and 2017 also decreased, according to the Census Bureau’s official poverty measure for New York City. The city defines ""near poverty"" as those living at 150 percent of the New York City poverty threshold or below. The city’s poverty threshold in 2017 was $33,562 for a two-adult, two-child family. The near-poverty threshold is $50,343.  The near-poverty rate dropped from 45.9 percent in 2013 to 43.1 percent in 2017, according to the city. The city cited rising wages, especially for low-wage workers, as one reason for the decrease. From 2013 to 2017, the minimum wage increased from $7.25 to $11 an hour. Not captured in this report are the effects from an hourly minimum wage of $15, which took effect in 2019. We got in touch with six experts who study poverty, many of whom work in New York City, and all agreed that poverty in New York City has dropped. They also did not raise any specific objections with the way New York City measures poverty; indeed, some praised the city’s methodology. They also said that the city’s findings on poverty rates are in line with their own research or with other measures they have studied. But some experts questioned whether de Blasio could take credit. How can you measure how city policies help people out of poverty, they asked, noting that poverty rates are falling across the country. Indeed, the poverty rate nationally using the U.S. Census Bureau’s official poverty measure and its supplemental poverty measure have fallen steadily between 2014, the year de Blasio took office, and 2017. Greg Acs, vice president for income and benefits policy at the Urban Institute, said many factors affect the poverty rate, such as food stamp benefits and the earned income tax credit, both federal programs. New York’s local initiatives also help, such as a higher minimum wage and universal pre-K, Acs said. But he warned that it’s a ""strong claim"" that the city’s actions led to poverty reductions. Morse said de Blasio’s initiatives are significant, and named paid leave, universal pre-K, and an increase in the minimum wage. The minimum wage increases were advocated by grassroots and labor organizers, strongly supported by de Blasio and signed into law by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. But a huge part of the falling poverty rate is the strong economy, she said. Harold Stolper, the chief economist at the Community Service Society of New York, a research and advocacy organization for low-income people, said ""the city has done a lot in recent years to improve the economic prospects for the neediest New Yorkers,"" but that it’s difficult to isolate the effects of those from other factors. De Blasio credits his administration’s push for universal pre-kindergarten for  helping families control their childcare costs. Other policies -- paid sick leave, housing programs, and improving access to social service benefits -- help low-income families, according to his administration. This year, the city also implemented discounts on public transportation, which help people get to work cheaper. The city’s poverty measure is one way to evaluate how life has changed for low-income people, said Robert Hawkins, associate professor in poverty studies at New York University. But he also pointed to the city’s homeless population, which has been on the rise, according to the Coalition for the Homeless. ""To say we’ve reached this number is a good talking point, but to impact people’s lives, we have to unpack poverty, it’s more than a number,"" Hawkins said. De Blasio said his administration has ""lifted hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty in the last five years."" His administration’s methodology in measuring poverty, recognized as effective, calculated that there were 236,500 fewer people in poverty or near poverty in 2017 because the poverty rate was lower than in 2013. But his statement didn't include the term ""near poverty."" He said poverty. And even using the city's definition of who qualifies as poor, there are roughly 140,000 fewer poor people in New York City today under the declining poverty rate. That's not hundreds of thousands. What's more, the federal poverty rate has been falling nationally, and the city has enjoyed a robust economy during de Blasio’s tenure. While the city has implemented and supported initiatives that help low-income people, experts are skeptical that his policies lifted all of those people out of poverty as his use of the word ""we"" suggests. We rate his claim Half True.  ",/factchecks/2019/jun/10/bill-de-blasio/de-blasio-claims-city-helped-people-out-poverty/

No, illegal immigrants and refugees are not causing six eradicated diseases to come back
","A viral post circulating online is making the far-reaching claim that six infectious diseases that have been eradicated are now spreading again and that ""illegal immigrants"" and ""refugees"" are the reason they are making a comeback. The post says, ""Six Eradicated Diseases are making a comeback thanks to refugees and illegal immigrants,"" with the alleged eradicated ailments as follows: Tuberculosis, measles, whooping cough, mumps, scarlet fever and the bubonic plague. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There are several things wrong with this claim. To understand, we first should discuss what the term ""eradication"" means when it comes to infectious disease. A disease is ""eradicated"" when it is eliminated worldwide. To date, only one disease that spreads among humans has been eradicated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization: smallpox. The WHO declared smallpox eradicated in 1980 following a global immunization campaign and, according to the CDC, no cases of naturally occurring smallpox have been reported since 1977. (A second disease, rinderpest, has also been eradicated, but rinderpest spreads only among animals, not humans.) When the incidence of a disease is reduced to zero in a particular geographical location such as a country or continent – as opposed to worldwide – virologists refer the disease as having been ""eliminated"" instead of ""eradicated."" So, a disease can be eliminated in a part of the world before it is completely eradicated. Moreover, when the Facebook claim speaks of tuberculosis and scarlet fever as having been eradicated, it’s important to understand that only infectious diseases that already have measures in place to fight them are considered eradicable (for example, no vaccine currently exists for scarlet fever). Even then, experts say some are much more difficult to control than others. Tuberculosis is indeed infectious and has a vaccine, but because the pathogen only needs 10 or fewer organisms (most need hundreds or thousands), it is slow-growing, and can take several months to show up in a lab test. So, not only has tuberculosis not been eradicated as the claim states, it is actually considered notoriously difficult to eradicate. Third, of the six illnesses listed in this problematice Facebook post, only one – Measles – is on the CDC’s list of current outbreaks. Measles has never been eradicated, but it was declared ""eliminated"" from the United States in 2000. A recent resurgence of the disease, however, has grabbed lots of headlines. Virologists at the CDC attribute the current U.S. outbreak, which includes the largest number of cases since 1992, to travelers (not necessarily immigrants) and those who refuse to get vaccinated: ""The U.S. experienced 17 outbreaks in 2018. Three outbreaks in New York State, New York City, and New Jersey, respectively, contributed to most of the cases. Cases in those states occurred primarily among unvaccinated people in Orthodox Jewish communities. These outbreaks were associated with travelers who brought measles back from Israel, where a large outbreak is occurring. Eighty-two people brought measles to the U.S. from other countries in 2018. This is the greatest number of imported cases since measles was eliminated from the U.S. in 2000."" Amy Rowland, spokesperson for the CDC’s Global Health Division, also told PolitiFact immigrants and refugees are not to blame for the outbreaks. ""No, it is not immigrants or refugees causing these outbreaks,"" Rowland said. ""It has to do with travel and people who are not vaccinated or under-vaccinated. It has nothing to do with illegal immigrants."" A viral social media post claims that six eradicated diseases are making a comeback due to ""refugees and illegal immigrants."" First, global health leaders have only ever declared one human disease has been declared eradicated, not six. And there is no evidence to back up the suggestion that refugees and undocumented immigrants are to blame for any disease making a comeback. We rate this infectious post False.",/factchecks/2019/jun/10/facebook-posts/no-illegal-immigrants-and-refugees-are-not-causing/
"['Impeachment', 'Texas', ""Beto O'Rourke""]","
How long has O'Rourke said 'it's time for Congress to act' on impeachment?
","Democrat Beto O’Rourke was one of the first presidential candidates from his party to call for President Donald Trump’s impeachment, and during an interview on MSNBC the Texan said he long has been stressing the need for action. ""For more than a year, I have been saying that it’s time for Congress to act and begin impeachment proceedings,"" O’Rourke said, before delving into a discussion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s first public appearance since launching his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Is O’Rourke right when he says that he has been saying it’s time for Congress to start impeachment proceedings for more than a year? No, not really. Senate campaign saw varied language Chris Evans, spokesman for O’Rourke, said the Democrat has been ""consistent in saying that he would vote for impeachment in the House."" Evans said O’Rourke made comments about impeachment throughout his campaign to unseat U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, last year. He also noted that Cruz’s campaign ""regularly mentioned"" O’Rourke’s stance on impeachment during the race. ""Saying he would vote to impeach the president is saying he believes there is enough reason, enough justification, for Congress to take action,"" Evans said in an email. ""If he didn't believe Congress should conduct those proceedings, he wouldn't have repeatedly said he'd vote to do so."" While O’Rourke, a former three-term congressman from El Paso, has said he would personally support impeaching Trump for more than a year, these statements often came with caveats. He did not issue a direct call for impeachment until last month. He hasn't been consistent in his public comments about whether ""it’s time"" for Congress to act on impeachment and he voted twice against opening impeachment proceedings as a member of the House — first in 2017 and again in early 2018. Evans noted in his email that, ""you’re not looking into whether he ‘called’ for impeachment but rather whether — as he said on MSNBC — he felt like it was time for Congress to act. He has for more than a year said he's seen enough to vote for it, and, given he was a member of the body, have Congress act."" Evans shared eight news articles when asked to produce evidence for O’Rourke’s claim. They all include references showing his personal support for impeachment, but none show the Democrat explicitly stating that ""it’s time"" for Congress to act. Among those stories, he came the closest to saying it's time for Congress to act in a July 2018 interview with The Dallas Morning News, which quoted O’Rourke as saying: ""Impeachment, much like an indictment, shows that there is enough there for the case to proceed and, at this point, there is certainly enough there for the case to proceed."" It’s also worth noting that O’Rourke tends to make distinctions between impeachment in the House and conviction in the Senate. The Constitution allows the House to impeach a president by a simple majority vote. Once the case heads to the Senate, senators hold a trial and can convict and remove a president from office with a two-thirds vote. Early answers focused on Republican colleagues O’Rourke broached the subject of impeachment as early as August 2017, when he was asked his thoughts during a public event held by the Texas Tribune. He also discussed it in an interview with The Dallas Morning News in October 2017, stressing that, while he personally supported impeachment, Congress should not act until members of both parties can support the effort. ""The only way it should happen is that the facts are so compelling that a Republican colleague of mine can go back to her district or his district and explain to their constituents how they were able to vote to impeach the president of their own party,"" O’Rourke said, adding, ""That set of conditions doesn't exist today."" As his Senate campaign was picking up steam, O’Rourke appeared on KFYO Radio in Lubbock in April 2018 and discussed impeachment with Host Chad Hasty, who asked if the Democrat had, ""seen enough yet to where you would vote to impeach the president."" ""The answer is yes,"" O’Rourke said. ""Because I want to be straight with you. I've seen an attempt, no matter how ham-handed, to collude with a foreign government in our national election. I've seen an effort to obstruct justice in the investigation of what happened in the 2016 election."" After raising concerns about whether Trump was fit to be president and stressing the need for Mueller to complete his investigation, O’Rourke continued and said, ""Because here’s the thing: Impeachment doesn’t make any sense right now."" He said that it wouldn’t make sense until Republican lawmakers felt comfortable enough to ""come before their constituents and explain how they voted to impeach the president of their own party."" ""We are not there yet,"" he said. O’Rourke voted against impeachment proceedings O’Rourke said he would support voting to impeach Trump as early as August 2017 and had two opportunities afterward to support starting impeachment proceedings in the House. He voted against it both times. In December 2017, O’Rourke voted against an impeachment resolution by Rep. Al Green, D-Houston. The House tabled the resolution with a 364-58 vote. He voted against another impeachment resolution from Green in January 2018, which the House rejected 355-66. The PolitiFact treatment PolitiFact dissected O’Rourke’s stance on impeachment in July 2018 (while fact-checking a Cruz claim about O’Rourke’s stance) in a piece titled: How Beto O'Rourke is a yes and no on impeaching Donald Trump now. The article determined that O’Rourke had made numerous statements about impeachment that boil down to this: ""he’d personally vote as a House member to impeach Trump, O'Rourke says, but he’s not in favor of that happening at this time."" Evans told PolitiFact at the time that O’Rourke had not called for Trump’s impeachment and he hasn’t brought up the subject ""at town halls or rallies, has not sent fundraising or petition emails on it, has not posted social media advocating for it, and has not used his current position of public trust to do so through floor speeches, letters or resolutions."" O’Rourke echoed that sentiment in a comments he made to the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal at the end of July 2018, which were published in full at the bottom of the PolitiFact piece. O’Rourke stressed the need for Mueller to be given a chance to complete his investigation ""and allow him to find the facts wherever they lead, as high up as they go."" ""On the issue of impeachment, I’ve never called for it, and you’ve seen us, I’ve never led a town hall with it,"" he said. ""I’m not on the resolution calling for the president’s impeachment."" And that remained the case through the end of his Senate campaign and the start of his presidential campaign in 2019. This March, when asked by The Dallas Morning News in Iowa if he still favored impeachment, as he had in the past, O’Rourke pushed back. The interaction also was documented in The Atlantic. ""You asked me one time if I would vote, and I said yes,"" O'Rourke said. ""I wasn't out there calling for it. I just think the distinction's important in this case."" He also suggested that the 2020 election would be more likely to decide what happens to Trump than impeachment proceedings in Congress. ""I leave it to Congress, where the power resides in our Constitution, to make the decision based on the facts that are available now or those that are provided by the Mueller report,"" O’Rourke said. ""Where I think, however, this'll be decided ultimately is in the November 2020 elections."" But by May, O’Rourke said he explicitly supported impeaching Trump in an interview with The Dallas Morning News. ""We're finally learning the truth about this president,"" he said. ""And yes, there has to be consequences. Yes, there has to be accountability. Yes, I think there's enough evidence now for the House of Representatives to move forward with impeachment."" Our ruling O’Rourke said, ""For more than a year, I have been saying that it’s time for Congress to act and begin impeachment proceedings."" It’s true that O’Rourke has said for more than a year that he would personally support impeaching Trump, but he consistently has said that this fact does not mean that he is calling on Congress to take action. As a member of the House, he twice voted against impeachment resolutions that came to the floor after he first said he was in favor of impeachment. It’s a stretch to suggest that O’Rourke can simultaneously say he's not calling for impeachment while still suggesting that ""it’s time"" for Congress to act. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.    ",/factchecks/2019/jun/10/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-impeachment-trump-congress-time-act/

Kamala Harris claims Trump’s tariffs cost $1.4 billion per month. That’s Mostly True
","California Sen. and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has repeatedly attacked President Trump over the cost of his tariffs. Recently, she said they amount to a huge monthly tax on working Americans. ""Let’s call it what it is. It’s a trade tax,"" Harris claimed at the California Democratic Party Convention in San Francisco earlier this month. ""I like to call it Trump’s trade tax. And his trade tax is taking $1.4 billion out of working people’s pockets every month."" We reported on this claim earlier. But we did not initially attach a rating to it. Harris isn’t the only one to describe Trump’s tariffs as a tax. Economists and tax reform advocates have done the same. By definition, a tariff is a tax or duty to be paid on a class of imports or exports. PolitiFact National examined who pays for the tariffs on Chinese goods, for example, and concluded: ""In many if not most cases, those costs are passed on to American consumers, whether it’s directly on the products hit by the tariffs or through an impact on U.S. companies who use raw materials hit with tariffs."" For this fact check, we wanted to know whether Trump’s actions are costing as much as Harris claims. So, we focused on the second portion of her statement, that the tariffs are ""taking $1.4 billion out of working people’s pockets every month."" Our research The senator’s claim is supported by a March 2019 study titled ""The Impact of the 2018 Trade War on U.S. Prices and Welfare."" It was conducted by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a London-based think tank. It concluded: ""Overall, using standard economic methods, we find that the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018."" It doesn’t say, however, that the impact was limited to ""working people."" Stephen Redding, one of the report’s authors and an economics professor at Princeton University, told us by email that Harris’ claim ""is a correct characterization of our research."" He clarified that ""the impact is for the US economy as a whole, which includes all consumers."" The CEPR study includes research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton and Columbia universities. It reviewed all Trump administration tariffs imposed in 2018 on several countries, including China, on imports from solar panels to washing machines to steel and aluminum. The $1.4 billion figure does not include any impact from Trump’s recent threat to place tariffs on Mexico. Harris’ position on trade Harris told McClatchy this month she opposes the free trade deal Trump signed with Mexico and Canada last year, which updates the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. ""I’m not in favor of the USMCA, what I call NAFTA 2.0,"" she told the news organization, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. She has previously said she would not have voted for the original NAFTA deal, saying in an interview on CNN in April, ""I believe that we can do a better job to protect American workers."" Harris also came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP, an Obama-backed trade deal between 12 Asian and Pacific nations, during her 2016 Senate race, McClatchy reported. Trump ultimately pulled the country out of TPP after he was elected. ‘A very credible piece of work’ Several economists not affiliated with the CEPR study on the cost of Trump's tariffs told us it is reliable. ""It is a very credible piece of work. For the moment, it is the defining economic evaluation of Trump’s trade policies,"" Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow, Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an email. He added that Harris’ statement may understate the effect of Trump’s tariffs on households, noting a $3 billion per month cost cited in the report. Redding, the report’s co-author, described the $3 billion as an additional tax cost, ""which is a transfer from importers and consumers to the US government."" He maintained, however, that the $1.4 billion is the most correct figure to use when referencing the impact on consumers, describing that as the ""welfare cost (reduction in real income) to the US economy as a whole."" A spokesman for Harris’ campaign cited a CNBC.com article that summarized the CEPR study. Our rating California Sen. Kamala Harris recently claimed President Trump’s tariffs are ""taking $1.4 billion out of working people’s pockets every month."" A March 2019 study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research generally supports her claim. It notes, however, that was the impact for 2018 and that all consumers felt the effect of the tariffs not just working people.  There’s no way yet to know the full impact of the president’s tariffs this year.

Lightfoot spreads rumor that Chicago police union told cops not to police
","Donald Trump created a stir as a presidential candidate in 2016 when he claimed a ""top police officer"" in Chicago told him the city’s violence problem could be stopped almost cold ""in one week."" Trump put no name or other details to his assertion, part of a repeated riff about how law enforcement in Chicago coddled criminals. Both city and police union leaders said at the time they had no idea what the future president was talking about. That incident came to mind recently when new Mayor Lori Lightfoot brought up during a cable TV interview another spasm of violence over Memorial Day weekend when 41 people were shot and 7 killed. In her remarks, Lightfoot sought to draw a connection between the carnage and difficulties she is expected to encounter negotiating a new police contract with the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, which represents thousands of rank and file officers. ""You know, there were rumors floating around about — and I didn’t verify this — but rumors floating around that they were telling their officers, ‘Don’t do anything. Over Memorial Day weekend, don’t intercede,"" Lightfoot said on CAN-TV’s ""Chicago Newsroom"" program. ""‘If you see some criminal activity, just lay back, do nothing.’ I hope to God that wasn’t true because, man oh man, if that happened there’s going to be a reckoning."" Lightfoot made her reputation cracking down on lawless cops, so she and Trump clearly come from very different places when it comes to crime-fighting. Yet the parallel between their inflammatory claims was jarring. While we are not in the habit of delving into a claim prefaced as rumor, the suggestion from the newly minted mayor that union brass may have told cops not to police cried out for a closer look. We weren’t alone in being taken aback by Lightfoot’s assertion. Moments after she leveled it, the show’s host, Ken Davis, asked the mayor whether she bought in to the rumor. ""Do you have any reason to believe that that happened?"" Davis asked. Without answering directly, Lightfoot contended past leadership of the police union had previously pushed for something similar. ""Leading into Labor Day in 2016 when we had this catastrophic level of violence, the then-(union) administration — which, there are some carryovers from that — put out a memo telling officers that they should not show up for work, that they shouldn’t do their job, that they shouldn’t be the police,"" she said. That exaggerates the record. According to an August 2016 Chicago Tribune story, the union called for officers not to accept overtime requests during Labor Day weekend — but it said nothing about the officers’ regularly assigned work, as Lightfoot suggested. What’s more, that example does not back up the claim Lightfoot made about Memorial Day weekend, which she acknowledged was unverified but chose to publicly repeat nonetheless. Like her predecessor, former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Lightfoot opted to boost patrols in an attempt to stem holiday weekend violence, assigning overtime work to an additional 1,200 cops. Her plan also involved offering free programming activities aimed at youth and partnering with religious leaders to help keep the peace. It is a lamentable commentary on the chronic state of violence in Chicago that the volume of shootings and deaths over this year’s Memorial Day weekend was little changed from recent years. At the same time, the lack of a surge in mayhem beyond past levels argues against any whispering effort by the FOP to get officers not to do their jobs. We followed up with Lightfoot’s office to see if the mayor had corroborated what she’d said about Memorial Day weekend since her TV appearance. ""All we can say about this is that the mayor heard it from someone who’s in a position to know and she heard it from a law enforcement source,"" spokeswoman Anel Ruiz told us in a phone interview. We also ran Lightfoot’s claim by Kevin Graham, the union’s leader, who said he had no idea what Lightfoot was talking about. ""That’s ridiculous,"" he said. ""I am unaware of anyone telling anyone not to do their job."" And we checked with Ald. Chris Taliaferro (29th), who chairs the City Council Committee on Public Safety and served as a Chicago police officer for more than 20 years. He told us he had not heard any rumors, much less verified information, to that effect. Lightfoot declared in a cable interview that she had heard a rumor about city police union officials ""telling their officers, ‘Don’t do anything. Over Memorial Day weekend, don’t intercede. If you see some criminal activity, just lay back, do nothing.’"" Despite acknowledging that the claim she was sharing had not been verified, Lightfoot chose in her capacity as mayor to amplify it anyway. When we followed up, the mayor’s office would not tell us whom she heard it from beyond saying her source was someone in law enforcement. We also checked with the union’s leader and the Chicago alderman who chairs the city’s public safety committee, both of whom said they had no idea what she was referencing. Given that neither Lightfoot’s office nor our independent reporting was able to verify the rumor the mayor introduced into public discourse, we rate her claim False.

Variations of the claim have advised people to apply a myriad of substances to remove the tick, like petroleum jelly or nail polish. Some have suggested lighting it on fire with a match. But none of these procedures are endorsed by experts. The CDC cautions people on its website to ""avoid folklore remedies such as ‘painting’ the tick with nail polish or petroleum jelly, or using heat to make the tick detach from the skin. Your goal is to remove the tick as quickly as possible – not waiting for it to detach."" Since ticks can transfer illness, notably Lyme disease, in just one bite, health officials agree that ticks should be removed from the skin as quickly as possible – but also correctly. Officials at the Mayo Clinic advise grasping the tick ""as close to the skin’s surface as possible, using tweezers if available, and to pull upward with a steady continuous motion."" The University of Rhode Island’s TickEncounter Resource Center also suggests using tweezers, but particularly ""pointy"" ones: ""Household tweezers just aren't the right tool for proper tick removal. TickEase and ProTickMe are two brands of pointy tweezers that work well and are inexpensive, too."" The Bay Area Lyme Foundation also suggests the use of pointy tweezers and cautions not to yank the tick out, as its mouth could remain and so could the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. The CDC recommends similar steps for effective and safe tick removal. From its website: 1. Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin’s surface as possible. 2. Pull upward with steady, even pressure. Don’t twist or jerk the tick; this can cause the mouth-parts to break off and remain in the skin. If this happens, remove the mouth-parts with tweezers. If you are unable to remove the mouth easily with clean tweezers, leave it alone and let the skin heal. 3. After removing the tick, thoroughly clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol or soap and water. 4. Never crush a tick with your fingers. Dispose of a live tick by putting it in alcohol, placing it in a sealed bag/container, wrapping it tightly in tape, or flushing it down the toilet. 5. Follow-up: If you develop a rash or fever within several weeks of removing a tick, see your doctor. Be sure to tell the doctor about your recent tick bite, when the bite occurred, and where you most likely acquired the tick. Old viral social media posts claim that smothering a tick in liquid soap and swabbing it is a ""safe"" and ""easy"" way to remove ticks from the skin.

President Barack Obama says he raised fuel standards after '30 years of inaction'
","
President Barack Obama claimed a record of accomplishment as he accepted the Democratic nomination to run for a second term — including a victory on one issue he said hadn’t been touched in three decades.

""After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas,"" he told delegates to the Democratic National Convention on Sept. 6, 2012.

We rated Obama’s original presidential campaign pledge to raise fuel economy standards a Promise Kept.

But we wondered, was it true that ""after 30 years of inaction,"" fuel standards will double for cars and trucks by 2025?

That might be news to President George W. Bush.

 What Obama did

In August 2011, the Obama administration issued new federal fuel economy rules that set an average fuel efficiency goal of 54.5 miles per gallon for the 2025 model year.

That’s nearly twice the 27.6 miles per gallon standard for 2011, for cars and for trucks.

So far, so good.

But we paused at Obama’s claim that his administration took action ""after 30 years of inaction.""

Mileage standards in the United States have been in place since the 1970s Arab oil embargo.

Back then, Congress passed the Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975, which boosted the fuel economy of cars and light trucks. ""Corporate average fuel economy,"" or CAFE, standards reached 27.5 miles per gallon in 1985 — then hovered there.

Obama’s speech might have left you thinking nothing else happened until his administration took charge.

But in 2007, Bush signed the Energy Independence and Securities Act, which required ""substantial, continuing increases in fuel economy standards,"" according to a helpful history lesson at auto information site Edmunds.com.

Bush noted at his signing ceremony that the law marked the first statutory increase in fuel economy standards since they were enacted — something he had asked for.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., then speaker of the House, remarked on the historic nature of the bipartisan legislation, writing that its auto efficiency reforms were ""the first in more than 30 years.""

And that law laid the groundwork for Obama’s rule changes.

Bush’s administration left for Obama’s the job of finalizing standards, something it hadn’t yet done ""because of the uncertainty gripping car companies,"" Reuters reported.

""A lot of what Obama's doing is really extending what President Bush started,"" Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman for Edmunds.com, told PolitiFact in January.

That’s not what Obama’s sweeping oversimplification suggested.

The president also said that ""by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas."" That’s what the new rules require. Edmunds.com reports that ""regulators, environmentalists and most automakers agree that existing technologies can be used to achieve this plan's goals."" There’s just debate about their cost. While automakers have so far met boosted standards by updating traditional engines, Anwyl says those relatively inexpensive gains won't carry companies through lofty goals set for 2025.

Still, 13 automakers in August announced support for the new standards, signaling they believe they’ll be able to achieve the gains.

 Our ruling

Obama said, ""After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas."" The Obama administration launched new fuel efficiency standards that significantly raise the bar for automakers over the next decade.

But the rules, which raise standards from their 1985 levels, grew from a bipartisan law requested and signed by Bush. We’ll give Obama credit for pushing for a long-term agreement with aggressive goals and working with automakers who say they’ll get it done. But he’s on shakier ground when he gives the impression his administration was solely responsible. We rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/sep/10/barack-obama/obama-fuel-standards-inaction/

Julián Castro says United States has had 30 straight months of private-sector job growth
","
Julián Castro did not run home to Texas after delivering the keynote at the Democratic National Convention. Rather, the San Antonio mayor stumped for President Barack Obama in the battleground state of Virginia and made another national TV appearance.

On the Sept. 9, 2012, edition of NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" host David Gregory asked Castro if ""Americans blame this president for the job situation or do they listen to President (Bill) Clinton who said nobody could have fixed it faster, not even me? I mean that seems to be -- if Americans believe that, then maybe they give him a chance.""

Castro replied: ""I think President Clinton did a stellar job, as usual, making the case that we see now 30 straight months of private sector job growth, 4.6 million jobs created. and I believe that folks see that kind of progress around the country. And so for (Republican presidential nominee) Mitt Romney to say, well, there's been no progress whatsoever, folks can tell the difference between what they see out there, and what he's saying.""

Castro was referring to Clnton’s convention speech nominating Obama for a second term.
In the speech, Clinton repeated a talking point often used by Democrats to tout Obama’s record on job creation.

""In the last 29 months,"" Clinton said, ""our economy has produced about 4.5 million private-sector jobs.""
   
Afterward, PolitiFact rated Clinton’s claim as Mostly True, saying that while Clinton had cherry-picked the job numbers to paint Obama’s record in the most favorable light, his wording held up.

Castro spokesman Jaime Castillo told us the mayor used the same methodology as Clinton.  
Still, he spoke a couple days after the government’s release of August employment numbers, making his counts slightly different from what Clinton aired during the convention.

In both cases, other ways of tabulating employment changes suggest less impressive growth in jobs -- even declines. By using private-sector job figures, for instance, Clinton and Castro overlook total job changes. Right off the bat, that paints Obama’s numbers favorably, since government jobs have declined during much of his term.

We consulted regional economist Cheryl Abbot of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics who said that if you count from the start of Obama’s term in January 2009 through August 2012, private-sector jobs have increased by 415,000, but total jobs decreased by 261,000 due to losses of government jobs.
   
Since this timeframe includes the start of Obama’s term -- when the economy was in freefall and before Obama’s policies had time to take effect -- we don’t think this is the best way to measure it.
   
The way Clinton did it is another way to count it. He started counting from the low point of jobs in February 2010.

The latest month-to-month dip in private-sector jobs occurred between January and February 2010 when the number of those kinds of jobs dropped by 27,000 to nearly 107 million jobs. Over the 30 months from February 2010 through August 2012, private-sector jobs increased by a little more than 4.6 million, totaling 111.4 million of late.

However, starting the count at the low point is a bit of cherry-picking. If you instead start at the official end of the recession in June 2009, private-sector jobs increased by nearly 3.5 million. That’s well below Clinton’s 4.5 million figure and Castro’s 4.6 million figure.
   
Finally, as we’ve written previously, presidents are not the only factor in job creation. The national, and world, economies are too big for any one person to control. So crediting Obama’s policies is at best partially correct because there are so many other factors -- such as policies of the Federal Reserve, the willingness of banks to lend money, and global business trends -- that play a role.

Bill Clinton says Obama administration trying to boost work in welfare
","
Former President Bill Clinton used his elder statesman’s status in the Democratic Party to make the case for Barack Obama’s re-election, while touching on a subject paramount in his own legacy: welfare reform.

In 1996 Clinton signed a landmark bill that transformed welfare from an indefinite entitlement to temporary assistance for poor Americans that required them to eventually join the workforce.

Mitt Romney, in a campaign ad, has claimed that Obama gutted the work requirement.

Clinton countered that in his Sept. 5 speech at the Democratic National Convention. Here’s what Clinton said really happened:

""When some Republican governors asked if they could have waivers to try new ways to put people on welfare back to work, the Obama administration listened because we all know it’s hard for even people with good work histories to get jobs today. So moving folks from welfare to work is a real challenge.

""And the administration agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent, and they could keep the waivers only if they did increase employment. Now did I make myself clear? The requirement was for more work, not less.""

At PolitiFact, we have examined this welfare controversy before. Here, we’ll review the issue in light of Clinton’s new statement.

The HHS memo
   
Since 1996, welfare has been administered through block grants to states. The grant program, called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, limits how long families can get aid and requires recipients to eventually find a job. It also includes stringent reporting requirements for states to show they are successfully moving people into the workforce.   

A July 12, 2012, memo from George Sheldon, acting assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said the department wanted to give states more flexibility in meeting those requirements. The memo notifies states ""of the Secretary’s willingness to exercise her waiver authority ... to allow states to test alternative and innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families.""
   
The memo outlined the kinds of waivers that would be considered. It suggested projects that ""improve collaboration with the workforce and/or post-secondary education systems"" and ""demonstrate strategies for more effectively serving individuals with disabilities,"" to give two examples.
   
What does that mean?
   
""If you can do a better job connecting people to work, we would consider waiving certain parts of the performance measures and use alternate measures,"" is how Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, translated the memo’s point. (The center supports the plan.)
       
The waivers, then, would inject some flexibility. For example, someone with a special-needs child might require different work arrangements than are currently allowed. Or a person who needs to improve his or her English skills might need more time to take classes.

Sebelius’ letter

HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius reasserted the intent of the changes in a July 18 letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.

""The proposal we have outlined strengthens the law’s purpose to move people off of welfare and into jobs by utilizing state-based innovation. Our goal is to accelerate job placement by moving more Americans from welfare to work, and no policy which undercuts that goal or waters down work requirements will be considered or approved by the Department,"" Sebelius wrote.

She noted how, in 2005, several governors sought such flexibility in welfare and state waiver authority. That letter was signed by 29 Republican governors, including Mitt Romney of Massachusetts.

Now, some states are again asking for flexibility, Sebelius wrote, naming Utah and Nevada, which both currently have Republican governors. She said some of the policies they requested would not meet the new HHS requirements.

""The department is providing a very limited waiver opportunity for states that develop a plan to measurably increase the number of beneficiaries who find and hold down a job. Specifically, governors must commit that their proposals will move at least 20 percent more people from welfare to work compared to the state’s past performance,"" Sebelius wrote. ""States must also demonstrate clear progress toward that goal no later than one year after their programs take effect. If they fail, their waiver will be rescinded.""

Because no waivers have yet been approved, it’s difficult to say exactly what the changes would look like.

The policy debate
   
It’s important to note that the waivers would not just be a change on paper. Schott said it’s possible that waivers will allow states to get credit under the work requirement for activities that don’t count currently.

Schott offered the hypothetical scenario that a state might change some requirements for specific subgroups, such as two-parent families, possibly by letting them stay in school longer. A waiver would let the state count those parents toward its work participation requirement. That is credit a state doesn’t get now and that could be counted toward a 20 percent improvement.

That broader definition has some critics concerned. Robert Rector, a welfare expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said it could ultimately allow ""state bureaucrats"" to count activities that aren't really work.

""In the past, state bureaucrats have attempted to define activities such as hula dancing, attending Weight Watchers, and bed rest as ‘work.’ These dodges were blocked by the federal work standards. Now that the Obama administration has abolished those standards, we can expect ‘work’ in the TANF program to mean anything but work,"" Rector argued.

He also wrote, following Clinton’s speech, that the 20 percent increase Sebelius is demanding is a ""meaningless measure"" because in a typical state 1.5 percent of welfare recipients leave the program for work every month. To increase that by 20 percent would be a bump to only 1.8 percent of recipients gaining employment.

""What will the other 98.2 percent of the caseload be doing? No one knows for sure. But one thing we do know for certain: They will be exempt from the federal ‘work participation’ requirements established in the welfare reform law,"" Rector wrote.

Schott counters that the 20 percent improvement measure doesn’t exempt anyone from working.

""Nothing about the waiver lifts the work requirement on any individual. The waiver is about the state’s performance measurement,"" she said. ""The federal work participation requirement is something that states must meet. … Nobody is suggesting waiving that.""

Rector also contends that Sebelius is not legally authorized to issue waivers of existing work requirements. He argues that the part of the law allowing waivers does not cover TANF work provisions.
   
""Critically, this section, as well as most other TANF requirements, is deliberately not listed... its provisions cannot be waived,"" Rector wrote in a July 12 column in the National Review.
   
His argument on that point got an important affirmation this week when the Government Accountability Office said that Sebelius’ waiver proposal is ""subject to the requirement that it be submitted to both Houses of Congress and the Comptroller General before it can take effect."" The Obama administration did not ask for Congress’ approval to grant waivers.
   
Our ruling
   
Clinton said in his convention speech that the Obama administration ""agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent, and they could keep the waivers only if they did increase employment.""
   
That's an accurate recap of the planned changes to Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. By granting waivers to states, the Obama administration is seeking to strengthen welfare-to-work efforts by letting states try different approaches based on their residents’ needs. That’s important too -- the waivers would be considered for individually evaluated pilot programs. HHS is not proposing a blanket, national change to welfare law.
   
The waiver offering was spurred by requests from several governors, including Republican governors, and Sebelius explicitly stated that only requests that ""demonstrate clear progress"" toward enhancing employment will be approved by HHS.

Clinton’s statement is accurate. We rate it True.",/factchecks/2012/sep/10/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-obama-administration-trying-boos/

Republicans plan to convert Medicare into a “voucher program,” Democratic congressional candidate says
","
From state Assemblyman Upendra Chivukula to President Barack Obama, Democratic leaders have been denouncing what they consider the Republicans’ plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system.

Chivukula, who is looking to unseat Republican Congressman Leonard Lance this November, repeated that claim in a TV interview leading up to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.

""The Republicans have declared war on women,"" Chivukula, who represents parts of Middlesex and Somerset counties, said in the Aug. 31 interview on NJToday. ""They have declared that they’re going to convert the Medicare program into a voucher program.""

PolitiFact National issued a Mostly True ruling on a similar claim made by Obama last month. The president claimed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, ""want to turn Medicare into a voucher system.""

Just as in that fact-check, Chivukula’s claim is mostly on solid ground.

The Medicare proposal backed by Romney and Ryan would provide ""premium support"" payments to future beneficiaries to purchase health insurance. There are some distinctions between the two terms, but the word ""voucher"" generally describes this approach.

Chivukula told us ""voucher"" is an appropriate way of describing the proposal, adding that the system would force beneficiaries to shop around for coverage.

First, let’s explain how the plan works.

Under the traditional Medicare program, which is available to anyone 65 or older, the government pays health care providers directly for services. Beneficiaries must bear the cost of deductibles and co-insurance.

Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman, has been the chief architect of a proposal to dramatically restructure Medicare. Romney has said his and Ryan’s Medicare plans are the ""same if not identical -- it’s probably close to identical.""

The latest version of Ryan’s plan was approved in March by the GOP-controlled House as part of a budget resolution, but it was later rejected by the Democrat-led Senate.

The plan would not affect current Medicare beneficiaries and individuals who become eligible before 2023. But starting in 2023, newly eligible beneficiaries would receive a premium support payment to purchase private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. The payments would either pay for or offset the cost of health care premiums.

In a report accompanying their budget resolution, House Republicans argued the proposal was not about providing vouchers.

""This is not a voucher program; a Medicare premium-support payment would be paid, by Medicare, directly to the plan or the fee-for-service program to subsidize its cost,"" according to the report.

So, the claims by Obama and Chivukula raised the same question: Is it reasonable to refer to premium support payments as vouchers?

As our PolitiFact colleagues noted, there are distinctions between the two terms, dealing with the type of inflation adjustment used and the degree of marketplace regulation imposed. Ryan’s most recent plan more closely reflects a pure premium support, but substantively, it’s somewhere between the two approaches.

Henry Aaron, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a policy think tank, told PolitiFact National ""that premium support is a type of voucher.""

But Robert Moffit, a health policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told PolitiFact National that the Obama campaign’s use of the term ""voucher"" is not justified, since the Ryan plan includes more regulation than for, say, airline vouchers for food and drink.

Our ruling

In a TV interview, Chivukula claimed Republicans ""have declared that they’re going to convert the Medicare program into a voucher program.""

Starting in 2023, the Republicans’ plan would provide premium support payments for new beneficiaries to purchase private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. The term ""voucher"" generally describes this approach.

"['Georgia', 'Elections', 'Mike Berlon']","
Which party has more supporters?
","
By most accounts, Georgia is as red politically as its famed clay.

Not so, says the chairman of the state’s Democratic Party.

""We know there are more Democrats in Georgia than Republicans. We know that for a fact,"" Mike Berlon said in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider blog as he and other party delegates gathered in Charlotte for the Democrats’ national convention. ""The problem is, we don’t win because of turnout."" 
It’s been nearly 20 years since a Democratic candidate for president won the state. Georgia’s governor, both of its U.S. senators and every statewide elected official are Republicans. In the Georgia Legislature, Republicans hold 115 of 180 House seats and 36 of 56 seats in the Senate. 
Considering such dominance, what’s the basis for claiming there are more Democrats in Georgia? 
Democratic leaders are hoping the state’s increasingly diverse electorate will help President Barack Obama pull off a victory in Georgia this year. Most polls, though, put Georgia on the Republican or leaning-Republican side of the scale.  
Berlon offered an explanation about why Democrats don’t win more statewide elections in the blog when he talked about turnout. Party spokesman Eric Gray forwarded us a spreadsheet that shows a slight majority of Georgians who voted in 2004 and 2008 elections considered themselves strong or leaned toward the Democrats. Gray said the data came from the Georgia secretary of state’s office, based on voter history.

In Georgia, there is no partisan voter registration, so primaries are open to everyone regardless of party affiliation. And the secretary of state’s office doesn’t keep statistics on voters’ party preference.

One way we attempted to glean which party has more voters was to examine the July 31, 2012, primary elections. Voters could choose whether to vote for candidates and various questions on the Democratic or Republican ballot. Most, by far, chose the GOP ballot. An average of 943,015 votes were cast on each Republican ballot question. An average of about 584,120 votes were cast on the four Democratic ballot questions.

We also looked at the Feb. 5, 2008, presidential primaries, since both parties were choosing candidates to serve in the White House and both races were hotly contested. On that day, more Georgians voted in the Democratic Party primary than on the Republican ballot. 
We also looked at the Feb. 5, 2008, presidential primaries, since both parties were choosing candidates to serve in the White House and both races were hotly contested. On that day, more Georgians voted in the Democratic Party primary than on the Republican ballot. Nearly 1.1 million votes were cast on the Democratic side while about 960,000 votes were cast on the Republican side.

The numbers for both elections were pulled from the secretary of state’s website.

We also looked at polling data.

Exit polls going back to 2006 and 2002 showed more Georgia voters identified themselves as Republican than Democrat, and the trend continued last year.

A slim majority of Georgians identified themselves as Republicans in a December 2011 poll conducted for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. In the Mason-Dixon poll of 625 registered Georgia voters, 38 percent said they were Republicans, 35 percent identified themselves as Democrats and 27 percent claimed they were independents or were affiliated with another political party. The poll had a 4 percentage point margin of error. 

A Pew Research Center poll released in March 2008 found a near statistical tie in Georgia between those who identify themselves as Republicans (32 percent) and those who describe themselves as Democrats (31 percent).  

Berlon’s statement seems to have a sliver of support in a 2008 CNN exit poll following the general election that showed 38 percent of Georgia’s voters identified themselves as Democrats, and 35 percent identified as Republicans. 
Results of a survey conducted in August of this year for the liberal-leaning group Better Georgia seems to follow the trend of the 2008 exit poll. An August 2012 survey by 20/20 Insight of 1,500 registered Georgia voters reported 8 percent more voters identified as Democrats (39 percent) than Republicans (31 percent). The survey had a 2.5 percentage point margin of error.

Despite those anomalies, a look at state voting patterns does not support Berlon’s statement, said Charles Bullock, a veteran political science professor at the University of Georgia.

""Every one of the 15 statewide offices is filled by a Republican,"" Bullock said. ""If we look at how people have actually voted, there is no evidence, at least in terms of voting behavior, that there are more Democrats than Republicans in the state."" 
Gray described 2010 as a ""wave election"" in which Georgia Republicans had the advantage because many voters were angry about the economy and more energized. 
""Things were bad in 2010. Republicans were much more energized,"" he said.

The party spokesman said the tide will turn in the Democrats’ favor this year. He also said the majority of Georgians who are not registered to vote are from demographic groups that typically vote for Democrats, such as African-Americans and Latinos.

There’s little concrete evidence that definitively shows which party has more voters since Georgia does not allow partisan voter registration and the secretary of state’s office doesn’t keep statistics on voters’ party preference. There is some information that supports Berlon’s argument, and some that counter his claim. 

While more people voted Democrat in the 2008 primary, Republicans dominated in the 2010 statewide races, and more Georgians voted on the GOP ballot in July.

The polling data says it’s close, but election results and the most recent makeup of the Georgia Legislature suggest there are more Georgians who consider themselves Republican.

Eric Cantor says Wayne Powell doesn't object to taking ""In God We Trust"" off currency
","
On a list of risky political stands, this one would rank near the top.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, is charging that Wayne Powell, his Democratic opponent, has endorsed removing ""In God We Trust"" from U.S. currency.

The controversy began in late August when Powell, a Chesterfield County lawyer, intensified his effort to draw conservative votes away from Cantor. Powell released his first TV commercial, which features him standing at front door telling a homeowner about his position on issues. The owner extends a handshake and says, ""Wayne, you’re my kind of Republican."" When Powell says he’s a Democrat, the owner slams the door.

To make sure the message reached conservative viewers, Powell aired it all three nights of the Republican National Convention on Fox News.

Cantor replied with an email blast on Aug. 29. ""If Wayne Powell was a Republican, he would be very, very lonely,"" the email said. It listed five issues where Powell ""would not find much company in the GOP."" The last one particularly caught our eye.

""And (Powell’s) stated position of having no objection to taking `In God We Trust’ off U.S. currency would probably alienate most everyone in our party,"" the email said.

We asked Cantor’s camp to back its claim about Powell’s stance on the national motto. Ray Allen Jr., a Cantor strategist, directed us to an online question-and-answer session Powell held earlier this year on Reddit, a social media web site.

Deep into the lengthy transcript, someone with the user-name ""niloakash"" asked: ""Would you support an hypothetical endeavor to remove `Under God’ and insert the original `E Pluribus Unum’ in American currency? In short: are you atheist friendly?""

Powell replied: ""America has a place for all people, regardless of faith, religion or lack thereof. I wouldn’t object to replacing `In God We Trust’ with the first American motto E Pluribus Unum (Latin; `Out of many, one’).""

We asked Powell about the statement. He told us he is responsible for the comment even though he never made it and opposes the removal of ""In God We Trust"" from currency.

Powell said Eileen Burke, a young website designer who worked briefly for his campaign, convinced him early this year to do an interview on Reddit. Powell said he dictated answers to the online questions to Burke, who typed them into a computer. After about two hours, Powell said he left while Burke remained logged on.

The next day, Powell said Burke told him, ""There was so much in this question-and-answer session that it went on after you got offline."" Powell said he didn’t give another thought to Burke’s comment until last week, when we sent him a copy of the statement about the national motto.

""She wrote it,"" Powell said. ""I did not answer it. I was not aware of it."" Powell said his aide ""took too much prerogative on the web site"" and he should have monitored her more closely. ""I’m responsible"" for the posting, he said.

Powell, who describes himself as a ""lifelong Southern Baptist,"" said he would oppose removing ""In God We Trust"" from currency or any other government activity. ""Why would we change the currency?"" he asked. ""Everytime I say the Pledge of Allegiance, I don’t have any compunction about saying `God.’""

Powell said Burke left his campaign early last year, lives in New England and he does not know how to reach her. Burke’s name appears once on finance reports Powell has filed with the Federal Election -- she received a $1,000 payment from the campaign on Jan. 14, 2012. The document lists a post office box address for her in Portland, Me. Our efforts to contact her were unsuccessful.  

We should note there is no movement afoot in Congress to remove the national motto from currency.

Our ruling

Cantor said Powell ""has a stated position of having no objection to taking `In God We Trust’ off of U.S. currency."" As proof, Cantor offers Powell’s comments in a question-and-answer session held on a social media website.

Powell acknowledges answering queries on the website for about two hours early this year this year with the help of a campaign worker. He says the question about the national motto came up after he left and the aide, exceeding her authority, wrote a response that he renounces and was unaware of until we contacted him last week. Powell takes responsibility for not keeping a closer eye on things.

There’s no doubt that when Cantor made his accusation, Powell’s stated position was, ""I wouldn’t object to replacing `In God We Trust’ with the first American motto, `E Pluribus Unum.’""

Biden says $500 billion of Bush tax cuts for wealthy would go to 120,000 families
","
Vice President Joe Biden moves into high-dudgeon mode when sharing his view that Republican budget cuts would harm average Americans.

He was in that zone during swing-state stops after the Republican National Convention, shouting out this line of attack at a Green Bay campaign rally on Sept. 2, 2012.

""They didn’t tell you why they are eviscerating all these efforts to help the working and middle class people of America,"" Biden said. ""They are doing it all in the service of massive tax cuts for the very wealthy … $500 billion of the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy goes to 120,000 families. Hear what I just said! One-half trillion dollars will go to 120,000 American families!""

Let’s examine Biden’s math and his characterization of the tax cuts enacted during Republican George W. Bush’s two-term presidency.

The Bush tax cuts

The Bush tax cuts, mostly in 2001 and 2003, lowered federal income tax rates at all levels, decreased the marriage penalty, lowered taxes on capital gains and dividends, boosted the child tax credit and phased out restrictions on how much higher-income people could deduct in mortgage interest and personal exemptions.

Those cuts were set to expire in 2010, but President Barack Obama and Congress agreed to extend them until Jan. 1, 2013.

Going forward, Obama thinks the cuts should stay in place for 98 percent of taxpayers, but wants to end them on income over $250,000 earned by couples or income over $200,000 for individuals.

Republicans, including Romney, want to make all the cuts permanent -- and that’s what drew Biden’s ire.

Biden’s claim

What about Biden’s half-trillion dollar claim?

His campaign said he based it on 10-year projections by White House budget officials, and private studies. Federal budgets typically look ahead 10 years.

Biden took a budget projection of $968 billion in tax savings, based on the cuts expiring for the top 2 percent. Then he determined that, within that group, the top 0.1 percent includes about 120,000 families -- and got 55 percent of that $968 million in tax savings.

The math comes out to $532 billion for those families -- the ""half trillion"" Biden shouted about.

Biden got the 55 percent and the 120,000 figures from two studies by the independent Tax Policy Center, a project of the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute that is a primary source of detailed reports on tax plans offered by elected officials and candidates. One of the studies said those 120,000 taxpayers have an average annual income of $8.4 million.

The vice president’s methodology got a thumbs down from Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, but a thumbs up from Andrew Fieldhouse, the federal budget policy analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank.

We asked both -- and a third expert, from the business-backed Tax Foundation -- to take their own look at the slice of tax benefits for 120,000 families at the top of the income range. And the Romney campaign offered up its own figures.

Here’s what we learned:

-- Williams did a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on Tax Policy Center data and estimated the 120,000 families would save more than $400 billion but less than $600 billion over 10 years if the Bush cuts were extended. He called that a ""best guess.""

-- Fieldhouse, of the Economic Policy Institute, used Tax Policy Center data and came up with $523-$570 billion, with the caveat that there are some limitations to the data and complicating factors.

-- William McBride, chief economist at the Tax Foundation, called Biden’s number ""plausible"" but considers the Tax Policy Center model too limited.

""The economy is much more integrated than they pretend, so tax cuts ‘for the rich’ or ‘for the poor’ are really tax cuts for the private sector ultimately in that the money flows back and forth through multiple transactions,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Romney campaign spokesman Darrel Ng said they came up with $407 billion, based on another set of data from the same source. Williams said the Romney campaign number was from outdated figures, but in the ballpark of other estimates.

So, there’s a basis for Biden’s $500 billion figure, with the footnote that the numbers are unofficial and somewhat rough.

Let’s turn to the VP’s view that the Bush tax cuts were ""for the wealthy.""

One way to judge that is who would benefit if they were permanently extended.

The benefits of the reduced capital gains rates and dividends rate, and the cuts in top income tax rates, skew heavily in favor of higher earners, the Congressional Research Service found in a December 2010 study. But the marriage penalty change and cuts in the lowest three income tax rates benefit taxpayers of all incomes, that study showed. The expanded child tax credit helps all but the top fifth of earners.

Overall, the top fifth of earners got 65 percent of the savings from the Bush cuts as a whole, according to a Tax Policy Center study of the cuts’ impact as of 2010. In contrast, the three-fifths bunched in the middle-income tiers got 34 percent. The top 0.1 percent -- the group Biden referred to -- got 19.7 percent of the savings.

The same trend held for the effect on tax rates. The upper 20 percent saw a much greater reduction in their tax rate than did the lower tiers.

The takeaway from all of that: the Bush cuts were not just ""for the wealthy,"" but benefited higher earners more than people in lower income tiers.

One more note: Biden is taking just one point from Romney’s tax plan when he tosses out numbers. Romney also wants to close off or limit some tax breaks.

""If Romney fulfills all of his tax promises, the rich would save relatively little,"" Williams wrote to us. ""They would save something, however, to the extent that economic growth contributes to the plan’s revenue neutrality.""

Our rating

Biden said that ""$500 billion of the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy goes to 120,000 families.""

We couldn’t find a definitive study confirming Biden’s figure, but four sources said it’s in that range. His math, and the description of the Bush tax-cut package, needs some clarification.

But, overall, we think this is Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/sep/09/joe-biden/biden-says-500-billion-bush-tax-cuts-wealthy-would/

Cory Booker says views on campaign finance reform highlight disparity between Democrats, Republicans
","
The nation’s two prominent political parties rolled out their priorities in separate conventions during the past two weeks.

The day after delivering his party’s vision for the country at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., Newark Mayor Cory Booker again tried to distinguish the differences between Democrats and Republicans.

""To me no side has a monopoly on good ideas, but when I look at this platform in many ways it's gotten a lot more extreme than even past Republican platforms and that's very disturbing to me. But more importantly I want to bring light to that and I want the nation to see, look at the actual policies that each of these parties stand for and decide which you want,"" Booker said in a Sept. 5 interview with #waywire, a news and video aggregation site that the mayor co-founded.

""Take campaign finance reform for crying out loud, I mean this is incredible. This platform says pull back even more of the rules on campaign finance reform, get rid of McCain-Feingold,"" Booker, a co-chair on the Democratic platform committee, said. ""This platform says well, wait a minute, we're out of control right now with all this super PAC money, we want to find a way to put more fair rules on campaign finance reform so that money doesn't speak louder than people. And so that to me is very dramatic.""

Do the two parties’ stances on campaign finance diverge as far as Booker claimed? A spokeswoman for Booker did not respond to an e-mail, but the documents show the Democratic mayor was on target.

When Booker mentions McCain-Feingold, he is referring to a campaign finance law -- formally called the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act -- that was sponsored by Sens. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat.

The law, which passed in 2002, made a number of changes to campaign finance, including banning corporations and unions from funding ads that mention a specific candidate during the 30 days before a primary or the 60 days before a general election.

Two years ago the U.S. Supreme Court overturned that provision of the law in its Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision. The Supreme Court also went a step further in that decision, saying political spending is free speech protected by the First Amendment and that the federal government may not limit expenditures by corporations or unions during campaigns.

Still other parts of the McCain-Feingold law -- such as a prohibition on national political parties from accepting unlimited amounts of contributions known as ""soft money""  -- remain intact.

But Booker said the Republican party platform calls for dismantling what is left of the law.

That’s true.

The document outlining the priorities of the Republican party specifically states, ""we support repeal of the remaining sections of McCain-Feingold.""

The GOP platform also calls for raising or repealing contribution limits and opposes any legislation designed to curtail the impact of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Citizens United case.  

On the other hand, Booker said his party’s platform calls for ""a way to put more fair rules on campaign finance reform"" and the document outlining Democratic priorities explicitly calls for more regulation.

""We support campaign finance reform, by constitutional amendment if necessary. We support legislation to close loopholes and require greater disclosure of campaign spending,"" the Democratic platform says.

Our ruling

Booker said that the Republican party platform says ""pull back even more of the rules on campaign finance reform, get rid of McCain-Feingold"" while the Democratic party platform says ""we want to find a way to put more fair rules on campaign finance reform.""

Booker is right about the gulf between Democrats and Republicans on campaign finance.

The GOP platform states: ""we support repeal of the remaining sections of McCain-
Feingold.""

The Democratic platform says: ""we support campaign finance reform, by constitutional amendment if necessary.""

That’s straightforward enough for us. We rate this statement True.

She accused Bass of violating federal regulations with his ad, ""Not Working for Us,"" which is running locally on WMUR.

Attack ads, like Bass’, are subject to a specific set of rules, and when they are broken, the candidate is no longer entitled to the same ad rate as competitors, Kuster argued.

""Congressman Bass's campaign is in violation of a rule which states that within 45 days of the Primary Election, candidates must include ‘a clearly identifiable photographic or similar image of the candidate’ for a period of no less than four seconds at the end of advertisements,"" Kuster said in a news release emailed to New Hampshire reporters on Aug. 31. ""Congressman Bass’s ad, ‘Not Working for Us,’ fails to meet this basic requirement and includes no photograph or other image of the candidate for any duration at the end of the advertisement.""

The lowest unit charge was established in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to protect candidates from excessive advertising costs -- charges no more than the lowest rates available to regular commercial advertisers.

It’s ultimately up to the FCC to decide if its rules were broken, but PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to find out if Kuster was right about what the FCC rules say.

When to show face

Kuster’s Campaign Manager Garrick Delzell said he had no comment on the situation, but emailed us portions of Section 315 of The Communications Act of 1934 and a letter to WMUR outlining the accusations against Bass’ advertisement.

The Communications Act requires that broadcast stations charge candidates for federal office for advertising ""during the forty-five days preceding the date of the primary runoff election and during the sixty days preceding the date of a general or special election, in which such person is a candidate, the lowest unit charge of the station for the same class and amount of time for the same period,"" said Paul Burkett, Kuster for Congress treasurer, in a letter to WMUR.

""A candidate loses this right to preferential pricing, however, if a candidates makes ‘any direct reference to another candidate for the same office, in any broadcast using the rights and conditions of access under this Act, unless such reference meets requirements of subparagraphs (C) or (D).’""

In other words, Kuster argues that because Bass’ ad is directed at her, it had to meet certain requirements.

OK, so let’s look at those subparagraphs. In this case it’s C, which deals with television broadcasts. It says that at the end of a TV broadcast, two things must appear simultaneously: 
     (i) A clearly identifiable photographic or similar image of the candidate; and 
     (ii) A clearly readable printed statement, identifying the candidate and stating that the candidate has approved the broadcast and that the candidate’s authorized committee paid for the broadcast. 
Kuster is right that Bass’ ad doesn’t contain a photo of Bass during the last four seconds of the broadcast.In the ad, Bass’ image does appear, but it’s during the first two seconds of the spot. In addition, the first words people hear is ""I’m Charlie Bass and I approve this message."" During the last four seconds of the commercial, it displays the words, ""Approved and Paid for by Bass Victory Committee,"" and there’sno picture of Bass.

According to Kuster, that means ""the Bass Victory Committee and Charlie Bass are no longer entitled to benefit from the lowest unit charge.""

We called the Federal Communications Commission.

Know your opponent

The extra photo requirement relies on the idea that Kuster and Bass are running for the same office. Cut and dried, right?

Well,as it turns out, the section of the Communications Act that Kuster cited does not even apply to her race against Bass -- at least not yet.

When Congress adopted Section 315, commonly referred to as the ""equal opportunity"" or ""equal time"" provision, it required opposing candidates receive the same treatment -- that, if one candidate for an office gets air time, his opponent ""for that office"" is entitled to equal air time at the same cost, according to the FCC’s ""The Law of Political Broadcasting and Cablecasting: Political Primer 1984.""

But the term ""for that office"" requires some careful distinction. Which candidates are actually  opponents, and whether stations are required to afford them ""equal opportunity"" under Section 315, depends entirely on the election.

""The FCC for many years interpreted Section 315 to mean that before the primaries or the nominating conventions take place, only those candidates who seek the nomination of the same party for the same office are entitled to opportunities equal to those of each other, since only they are opponents at that point,"" according to the Primer.

In other words, the primary and the general election are considered two separate races. Opponents in a primary are candidates of the same party running for the nomination to run in the general election. Even if Bass and Kuster consider themselves opponents at this point, the FCC views it differently.

In Bass’ case, his opponents are Gerard Beloin, Will Dean, Miroslaw Dziedzic and Dennis Lamare until the primary on Sept. 11.

No Democrats have filed to run against Kuster in the primary, but under FCC rules, she still wouldn’t be Bass’ opponent until the general election in November.

The content of Bass’ ""Not Working For Us"" advertisement -- which has been running for more than a week -- does not deal with ""equal opportunity"" issues or violate Section 315 because, according to the FCC, Bass’ opponents are the Republicans running against him in the primary, not his presumed Democratic opponent in the general election.

For its part, WMUR doesn’t see anything wrong with the ad -- or what they are charging Bass for it.

""At this point, it’s the opinion of our FCC attorney that the spot we’re running is legal and the rates we’re charging the campaign are fine as well,"" said Jeff Bartlett, WMUR’s President and General Manager.

""From the FCC’s point of view, that’s fine,"" he added, referring to the image of Bass. ""You can run it at the beginning or the end. There’s no regulation compelling us to do anything about it, because the FCC, which regulates us, says they can run it either place.""

Even if Bass and Kuster were currently considered opponents and Bass was found in violation of the rules, WMUR could still give him the lowest ad rate anyway, according to an opinion published by the Federal Elections Commission.

(It’s worth noting, the Federal Election Commission has its own set of rules ensuring candidates identify themselves in TV ads and the Bass advertisement passes those bars too — his image can appear at the beginning or the end.)

Our ruling

Kuster says Bass’ ""Not Working for Us"" TV ad forfeited its right to WMUR’s lowest rates because it violated FCC rules.

The rules Kuster cite only apply to advertisements about Bass’ Republican opponents in the primary. Until Kuster and Bass are direct opponents for the Second Congressional District general election race, her accusation is moot.

Moreover, even if Bass did violate the rules, WMUR is still free to charge him the lowest rate.

In Oregon, do 15-year-olds have complete control over sterilization?
","
In early August, CNSNews.com published an article with the headline ""Obamacare Mandate: Sterilize 15-Year-Old Girls for Free –Without Parental Consent.""

""Thanks to an Obamacare regulation that took effect on Aug. 1,"" read the article, ""health care plans in Oregon will now be required to provide free sterilizations to 15-year-old girls even if the parents of those girls do not consent to the procedure.""

The article went on to note that ""Under Oregon law, girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not.""

The story got picked up by several websites, quickly making its way around the web – and into our mailbox.

Of course, we were curious, too, so we got to checking.

Before we get to our findings, here's a little context about CNSNews.com for those – like us – who had not heard of it. CNSNews.com, based in a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C., says its goal is to ""provide an alternative news source that would cover stories that are subject to the bias of omission and report on other news subject to bias by commission."" It is not affiliated with Catholic News Service, which sometimes uses the same CNS abbreviation.

First, we checked the larger context of the article to see if ""Obamacare"" (the Affordable Care Act) requires health insurers to cover sterilization. We made several calls before we finally came up with a solid source that confirmed the new law requires providers to cover sterilization without cost to the patient. According to the U.S. Health Resource and Services Administration, services that fall under ""women's preventive health care"" are supposed to be covered for free, including mammograms, screenings for cervical cancer, prenatal care, contraception, sexually transmitted infection counseling and – yes –""sterilization procedures.""

As for the more salient detail – the age of consent in Oregon – we found a piece of Oregon law, which states that ""a minor 15 years of age or older may give consent, without the consent of a parent or guardian of the minor, to: Hospital care, medical or surgical diagnosis or treatment by a physician licensed by the Oregon Medical Board …""

Essentially, CNSNews.com linked those two pieces of information – the new requirements that insurance companies cover sterilization for free and the fact that Oregon's age of consent for health care is 15 years old. 
The idea that 15-year-old girls would be lining up for free on-demand sterilizations struck our readers either as scary - ""Is this true?"" - or ridiculous - ""This can't be true.""

We kept reporting.

We checked whether sterilization had always been covered by the Oregon Health Plan, the state-run health care insurance program that covers 600,000 people a month. We called Oregon Health Authority spokeswoman Alissa Robbins, who confirmed that it has been included since the plan's inception in 1994.

We also asked how many 15-, 16 – and 17-year-olds had received sterilizations under the plan. Robbins checked records for the last 10 years and found no sterilization procedure for a 15-year-old or a 16-year-old. As for 17-year-olds, she said, at most one such procedure is performed each year, though some years none is performed. She couldn't tell us the reason, she said, because it was ""protected health information."" However, it seems clear to us that the procedure for young women in that age bracket is exceedingly rare.

Robbins also pointed us to ORS 436, which lays out the warnings and consent procedures for anyone seeking sterilization, including minors. If a physician feels a minor is not capable of making an informed consent to be sterilized, her only recourse is to go to court and ask a judge to order that she is.

We also checked with OHSU Hospital to see what the process would be for a minor looking to be sterilized there. Spokeswoman Tamara Hargens-Bradley got back to us with a lengthy email.

For any patient under 30, she said, the hospital offers counseling about ""long-acting reversible contraceptives"" and ""the risk of regret"" in young women who are sterilized.

The ""most likely scenario in which a teenager would request sterilization,"" she wrote, ""is if she has a medical condition so severe that pregnancy would be life-threatening.""

If sterilization is not needed medically and a teen insists, Hargens-Bradley said the OHSU ethics committee would get involved. ""(T)hat would be very unusual and cause concern about whether the patient is capable of providing fully informed consent.""

She ended on this note: ""The health care reform offering contraception for free does not REQUIRE a physician to provide care they do not feel is safe for the patient. It requires that insurance plans cover all contraceptives available.""

After some vacation phone tag, we were able to talk to Michael Chapman, the CNSNews.com managing editor who had worked closely with the story's author, an intern who is no longer there.

""Our story is factual,"" Chapman said. ""Out story reports what the law is in Oregon and it reports what the federal regulation is.""

Chapman said the article was stymied in part by little response from the Oregon Health Authority. ""It's great they're willing to say more now that the story has come out.

""Nearly all health insurers must provide sterilization ... that's a fact.""

In a subsequent email, Chapman pointed out language on the Oregon Health Authority's consent to sterilization form that reads ""I was told that the decision to be sterilized is completely up to me.""

The form is the last step in many checks and balances that is only signed after the patient finds a physician willing to perform the procedure.

Now let's pull this together. Our reporting found that it's true that the health care act requires sterilizations to be free. It's also true that 15-year-olds can consent to health care without parental consent.

But CNSNews.com goes even further by alleging that ""under Oregon law, girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not.""

The statement would be accurate if it said health care plans in Oregon are required to pay for sterilizations for 15-year-old-girls. But instead, the statement confuses the insurers with providers – i.e. physicians – stating that 15-year-olds have ""complete control."" That's not true.

What a 15-year-old girl may want and what a medical provider is willing to do, at least in this case, are two very different things. Health care providers are under no obligation to provide sterilization on demand. In fact, free sterilization is not available on demand for 15-year-olds in Oregon. A 15-year-old must first convince a doctor that the procedure is medically necessary. While sometimes it is -- to treat cancer, for instance --a decade of records from the Oregon Health Plan and the explanation of procedures at OHSU show sterilization of 15-year-olds is incredibly rare.

In Oregon, 15-year-old girls do not have ""complete control"" over whether to be sterilized. We rule the statement False.",/factchecks/2012/sep/07/cnsnews/oregon-do-15-year-olds-have-complete-control-over-/

Mitt Romney said it was 'tragic' to end the war in Iraq, Obama says
","
President Barack Obama portrayed himself as seasoned on foreign policy and Mitt Romney as new to the world stage during his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention.

""You know, in a world of new threats and new challenges, you can choose leadership that has been tested and proven. Four years ago, I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did,"" he said. ""My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy, but from all that we've seen and heard, they want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly.""

Obama then went through a long list of complaints about Romney’s foreign policy views, including this one: ""My opponent said it was ‘tragic’ to end the war in Iraq.""

PolitiFact is evaluating other claims from Obama’s speech. Here, we wondered if Obama correctly quoted Romney as saying it was ""tragic"" to end the war in Iraq.

Back in October 2011, Obama announced that all troops would leave by the end of the year. Obama had always intended to draw down forces in Iraq, but by the end of 2011, the administration couldn’t reach an agreement with the Iraqi government on the size of the residual force. In the final days leading up  to withdrawal, the U.S. had about 200 members remaining that operate within the American Embassy, the New York Times wrote.

Romney criticized the withdrawal as too hasty, making comments at a roundtable discussion with veterans on Veterans Day in 2011 at a South Carolina barbecue restaurant. A colonel asked Romney how he would handle the influx of soldiers returning home from Iraq in need of jobs, according to a transcript of the event.

Romney called Obama’s troop removal ""an enormous mistake,"" ""a failing,"" and yes, ""tragic.""

His complete response: ""Yeah. A couple of things. One, you probably know that it is my view that the withdrawal of all of our troops from Iraq by the end of this year is an enormous mistake and a failing by the Obama administration. Secretary Panetta and others had indicated they were working to put in place a Status of Forces Agreement to maintain our presence there, so that we could most effectively transition to the Iraqi military and Iraqi security forces providing security for their country.

""The precipitous withdrawal is unfortunate. It's more than unfortunate. I think it's tragic. It puts at risk many of the victories that were hard-won by the men and women who have served there. I hope the risk is not realized. I hope instead that the Iraqis are able to pick up the baton, and despite the fact that we will have walked away on a too-rapid basis.""

From there, Romney moved on to the issue of jobless veterans (and even praised an Obama initiative to give businesses who hire veterans a tax credit).

By this point, Romney’s disdain for Obama’s Iraq war policy was known for a few weeks. His campaign issued a biting statement when Obama announced his plan to withdraw all troops from Iraq by the end of 2011.

""President Obama’s astonishing failure to secure an orderly transition in Iraq has unnecessarily put at risk the victories that were won through the blood and sacrifice of thousands of American men and women,"" Romney wrote on Oct. 21, 2011. ""The unavoidable question is whether this decision is the result of a naked political calculation or simply sheer ineptitude in negotiations with the Iraqi government.""

The Obama campaign countered that Romney lacked a plan to end the war.

Romney’s current campaign website is vague on plans for Iraq. He buries the issue in a topics page about the Middle East, praising George W. Bush’s 2007 ""surge"" of troops and bashing Obama’s 2011 withdrawal deadline. He makes a reference to reports from field commanders who ""recommended a 14,000 to 18,000-strong residual force as the minimum necessary to carry out our transition mission.""

""In light of these developments, it is impossible to forecast what conditions in Iraq will confront the next American president in January 2013,"" Romney states on his website.

We contacted both campaigns for our report. The Obama campaign pointed us to Romney’s remarks at the veterans’ roundtable. Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said Obama took Romney’s quote ""completely out of context.""

Our ruling 
According to Obama, Romney ""said it was ‘tragic’ to end the war in Iraq."" Romney characterized Obama’s 2011 removal of troops from the country with that word, but he was talking about the pace of the drawdown.

Romney’s point, held by other Republicans, was that Obama’s drawdown happened too quickly and would lead to an unstable transition for Iraq. Romney has said conditions in Iraq are difficult to forecast and he would prefer a larger transitional force.

Bill Clinton says the president let students pay 'clear, fixed, low' rate for loans
","
Former President Bill Clinton told delegates to the Democratic National Convention that there was an Obama policy they needed to share with ""every voter.""

Health care? Jobs? No — changes to student loans.

Clinton got down into details in his Sept. 5, 2012, speech to nominate President Barack Obama for a second term.

Student loan legislation under Obama, he said, ""lowers the cost of federal student loans.""

""And even more important,"" he told them, ""it gives students the right to repay those loans as a clear, fixed, low percentage of their income for up to 20 years.""

He argued that would mean students wouldn’t have to drop out of college for fear they couldn’t repay their debt, and would be free to pursue jobs of ""modest income"" such as teaching, policing or practicing small-town medicine.

We’re not checking those implications, but rather his characterization of the policy itself: Did Obama give students ""the right to repay those loans as a clear, fixed, low percentage of their income for up to 20 years""?

 Health care and education

The president signed student loan legislation in March 2010 as part of a larger package that updated his attention-grabbing health care law.

Previously, the government had paid private banks fees to provide federal loans to college students. The new law got rid of the middlemen, freeing up $68 billion over 11 years for Pell Grants and other programs.

It also changed loan repayment terms.

The government already had in place an ""income-based repayment plan"" that let students cap payments at 15 percent of their income above living expenses, and forgave remaining debt if they made those payments for 25 years. Under  the new law, payments dropped to 10 percent, with debt forgiven after 20 years, or half that long for some public service workers such as teachers.

The changes apply to new borrowers as of 2008 and haven’t kicked in yet, though they will by early next year, said Jason Delisle, an education budget expert at the New America Foundation who worked on the Republican staff of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee.

 ‘Clear, fixed, low’

Now, while ""10 percent"" may seem to fit the bill for a clear, fixed, low portion of income, the repayment plan is actually a little more complicated than that — mostly in borrowers’ favor. That’s because the plan lets borrowers deduct 150 percent of the federal poverty threshold from their incomes before calculating the 10 percent payment.

So, the rate for borrowers making less than $100,000 annually with a household size of one is actually less than 5 percent of total income, Delisle calculated, while it’s nearly 9 percent for higher income households.

The payments are adjusted each year based on borrowers’ income and family size, requiring annual documentation — not quite as simple as Clinton made it sound. And borrowers may have to pay taxes on the amount of their debt canceled or forgiven.

 Our ruling

Clinton said the president gave students ""the right to repay (federal) loans as a clear, fixed, low percentage of their income for up to 20 years."" That’s a reasonable characterization of a law the president signed in March 2010 that goes into effect by early next year for newer borrowers. But Clinton’s use of the word ""clear"" does oversimplify a somewhat more complicated reality that students will face an annually adjusted payment requiring paperwork on income and family size.

"['Tennessee', 'Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Tennessee Democratic Party']","
Democrats say Republican-backed legislation “would eliminate Medicare's guaranteed benefit for 800,000 Tennessee seniors and force them into TennCare.”
","
Legislation clearing the way for Tennessee to participate in a ""Health Care Compact""was supported by Republicans on a virtually unanimous basis during the last legislative session. Now, the Tennessee Democratic Party is trying to turn that support into a liability during the campaign season.

In news releases, the party is targeting virtually every incumbent Republican state legislator who faces a Democratic challenger in this fall's election. With minor variations depending on the targeted incumbent, the releases sent to media in East Tennessee districts carried very similar wording. As a sample, the following is from the release that went out in House District 33 in which state Rep. John Ragan, R-Oak Ridge, is being challenged by Democratic former Rep. Jim Hackworth:

""Earlier this year, Rep. John Ragan co-sponsored a measure that would eliminate Medicare's guaranteed benefit for 800,000 Tennessee seniors and force them into TennCare.""

Other releases simply change the name, using the same wording. Ragan was one of 44 co-sponsors in the House of the bill, which fell four votes short of the 50-vote majority needed for House passage in the last hour of the 2012 legislative session – when several Republicans had left the House chamber – after passing the Senate 22-9. All ""no"" votes came from Democrats in both chambers.

During the session, the bill (SB326) was hotly debated by lawmakers with considerable back-and-forth between Republicans and Democrats over what it would – or would not – do. The Democratic party's news release somewhat echoes comments of some Democratic legislators during that debate.

""What a lie!"" said Sen. Mae Beavers, R-Mount Juliet, who was lead Senate sponsor of the measure, when shown a copy of the Ragan release.

""It is obvious my opposition is spreading misinformation to confuse voters into supporting them because their platform is so unpopular in Tennessee,"" said Ragan in an emailed statement.

So who's right?

The bill basically envisions state government taking over most major health care programs now operated by the federal government, including Medicare. The idea is for states to join together in a Health Care Compact and petition Congress to give up federal control, sending states all of the federal funding being used to cover program costs – about $11.5 billion in Tennessee's case, according to the Legislature's Fiscal Review Committee staff.

Six states have already approved similar health care compact legislation, according to the Health Care Compact Alliance website. They include Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah. Indiana also passed a compact bill, but amended it to say that Medicare would remain with the federal government.

In Tennessee, Beavers said the bill was inspired by passage of the Affordable Health Care Act, now widely known as Obamacare, and its impact on state costs for overseeing Medicaid, which provides health care coverage for low-income persons as opposed to Medicare, which covers those over age 65 regardless of income. Beavers said, in fact, that if Obamacare winds up being repealed, she would see no need for a Health Care Compact – though, as things stand now, the quest for passage will be renewed in January.

In Tennessee, the state already operates the Medicaid program through the TennCare program. The federal government providing about two-thirds of the funding with the state covering the rest. Medicare is 100 percent federally funded.

The Tennessee Health Care Compact legislation, as filed in the past legislative session, is rather vague on what creation of a compact would mean.

""The legislatures of the member states have the primary responsibility to regulate health care in their respective states,"" says one provision of the bill.

As to how the legislatures in general, or the Tennessee legislature in particular, would regulate health care – including the guaranteed Medicare coverage for persons over age 65 – it is utterly silent. Beavers says that Medicare could well be left with the federal government, if the Legislature so decides.

It seems to us, then, that any declaration of what the bill would mean for Medicare enrollees – or most anyone else -- is speculation, not fact.

The Democrats' declaration is founded, first, on the expectation that Congress would go along with turning Medicare over to states that want to run the show – along with the money to pay for it. That is surely a debatable proposition; perhaps even doubtful.

And, if the feds did turn everything over to the states, they could attach conditions – say, for example, that current coverage of seniors must be maintained – though legislative sponsors envision the money coming with no strings attached.

Next, assuming Congress goes along with the idea and the money is sent to Tennessee without conditions, then the Legislature has to make decisions. That means introduction of more bills, more debate and a chance for citizen input before decisions are made. It's possible that citizens could become alarmed, once they are aware of the possibilities, and legislators would listen.
Now, the bill is so open-ended that the Legislature could, granted congressional approval, proceed to change Medicare eligibility rules in all sorts of ways.

Invited to defend the assertion made in the news release, Brandon Puttbrese, communications director for the Tennessee Democratic party, provided a lengthy response. Here's part of it:
""Were it (the compact) to take effect, Tennessee would receive a block grant from the federal government and also sacrifice hundreds of millions in federal funds by 2014 and billions by 2022 because funding for the compact is not designed to keep pace with medical inflation.

""So where do we make up that funding for Tennessee's seniors -- now including baby boomers -- who are going to depend on this care? New taxes? Repealing their millionaire and billionaire tax breaks?

""With no guarantees that the federal funding formulas will keep up with medical inflation or changing age structures in the population, Republicans in states like Tennessee are more likely to turn to the time-tested tools for cutting costs.

""Those are: changing eligibility standards so that fewer people are enrolled; reducing services provided shifting costs onto beneficiaries and cutting payments to providers.""

Puttbrese also provided links to testimony in Texas related to passage of a Health Care Compact bill. Part of the testimony involves whether the federal funding could run short in future years in a Medicare takeover. The Legislature's Fiscal Review staff basically assumes it would not under the Tennessee version of the bill, which includes a formula for changes in federal money based on inflation and population.

Setting aside that tangential discussion, we note that Puttbrese is making some assumptions and raising hypothetical questions. Which involves, again, speculation and not fact.

Further, Puttbrese says that the party has changed the wording on the releasessince our initial inquiry on that wording. The initial releases targeted East Tennessee Republicans; the change was made as releases began targeting Middle Tennessee Republicans, Puttbrese said.
Here's the new wording in a release targeting Rep. Jim Gotto, R-Nashville, that replaces the language in the earlier version above targeting Rep. John Ragan:

""Earlier this year, Tennessee Republicans, including state Rep. Jim Gotto, co-sponsored the Health Care Compact bill, an extreme measure that endangers the health benefits of 800,000 Tennessee seniors enrolled in Medicare and shifts management of their healthcare plans to TennCare.""

The key change is to substitute ""would eliminate Medicare's guaranteed benefit for 800,000 Tennessee seniors"" to ""endangers the health benefits of 800,000 Tennessee seniors.""

With the revision, we think the Democrats have a reasonable assertion, insofar as political endeavors go. If the federal government turned Medicare over to the state Legislature's oversight with no strings attached, as conceivable under the bill, we're not ready to predict what would happen. But the possibility of endangered beneficiaries would be there.

Indeed, if the original release language was changed to use the word 'could' instead of 'would,' the party would have a more defensible statement.

But we set out to evaluate the original release, not the revised version and not to engage in semantic speculation over what difference the change of a word might have made.

The Democrats' declaration that the Health Care Compact bill would eliminate Medicare's guaranteed benefit for Tennessee seniors is False.",/factchecks/2012/sep/07/tennessee-democratic-party/democrats-say-republican-backed-legislation-would-/
"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Rob Portman']","
Rob Portman says Ohio's jobless rate would top 10 percent if tally included those who quit looking for work
","
Ohio's employment picture has improved since the 2010 midterm elections. It's a positive development that, with a presidential election approaching, becomes something of a double-edged political sword.

Gov. John Kasich likes to talk about the state's job growth and lowered unemployment rate on his watch -- though an improving economy is also considered a favorable indicator for President Obama, a Democrat.

Sen. Rob Portman, who chairs Mitt Romney’s campaign in Ohio, faced the dilemma of addressing it on Fox News when host Sean Hannity noted how ""the economy has improved since John Kasich has been governor.""

Portman replied that Kasich has done a good job, but is ""still facing the headwinds from Washington."" Unemployment is still relatively higher than what Ohio is used to, he said.

""I mean, you look at it compared to, you know, where we've been in the past. We've got 7.2 percent unemployment, but when you include the folks who have stopped looking for work, it's actually over 10 percent.""

Portman said something similar about the national jobless rate early this year. PolitiFact Ohio rated that claim as Half True.

We asked his office to back up his statement about Ohio. His staff cited the same national data that it provided for his earlier statement.

It relies on calculations for the labor force participation rate. Here’s how it works:

The figure, calculated by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the percentage of the population age 16 or older that is either employed or actively looking for a job. People in the military and medical or penal institutions are excluded.

The general unemployment rate does not count people who have stopped looking for jobs and dropped out of the labor force.

According to the BLS, labor force participation has fallen from 66 percent of the population to 63.7 percent since December 2007. That indicates many workers have dropped out of the labor force.

If the percentage were still at 66 percent, the labor force -- about 155 million people in July -- would be about 5.6 million people larger, Portman's office said. ""It’s reasonable to assume that these people would be working if they could (there is no other reason for the labor force participation rate to suddenly drop so much).""

Adding those people back into the labor force would raise the number of unemployed from 12.8 million to 18.4 million people, Portman’s office said, because there wouldn’t automatically be additional jobs for them. As a result, unemployment would be about 11.5 percent -- well above the 10 percent cited.

But there’s a catch. That's a national number. On Fox, Portman was talking about Ohio.

We did the math for Ohio, using the most recent figures from the BLS.

Those figures, for July, show a labor force participation rate of 63.8 percent and a total population of about 9.04 million, for a labor force of about 5.77 million persons.

A participation rate of 66 percent would mean a larger Ohio labor force -- abouit 5.97 million -- and adding in the difference to the 417,937 unemployed persons in the state would show an unemployment rate of 10.3 percent -- over 10 percent, as Portman said.

The other problem with that calculation, though, is determining how much of the decline in the labor force participation rate is actually recession-related.

A January report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated about a third of the decline in labor participation between 2007 and the second half of 2011 reflected factors other than the recession, such as the aging of the Baby Boom generation into retirement.

A research paper produced in March by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago attributes just under half of the decline in the labor force participation rate since 2000 to shifting demographics that include retiring baby boomers and a decline in teens working.

Retirement, disability, going to school or caring for household members are common reasons people give for not looking for jobs, according to researchers at the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank who drew on federal data.

A BLS economist declined to assess Portman’s calculations for our previous fact check, but did say that BLS would never assume that the extra people added to the workforce in a higher labor force participation rate would all be unemployed.

He also noted that his agency tracks the number of people outside the workforce who say they want a job. Those individuals must have searched for work during the past year, but not the month before they were surveyed.

Using that tracking, the BLS itself offers alternative measures of unemployment in addition to the official unemployment rate.

One, the ""U-4"" unemployment rate, adds ""discouraged workers"" to the jobless rate. Those are people who have looked for work in the past 12 months but are not currently looking, for the specific reason that they believe no jobs were available for them.

In Ohio, the U-4 rate from the third quarter of 2011 through the second quarter of 2012 averaged 8.3 percent.

Another measure, the ""U-5"" rate, further adds ""marginally attached"" workers, who have looked for jobs in the past year but are not currently looking and could have cited any other reason for not looking.

Ohio's most recent U-5 rate was 9.2 percent.

The broadest category, ""U-6,"" additionally counts people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job.

Ohio's latest U-6 rate was 14 percent.

Portman's assertion is partly accurate. Nobody disputes his contention that the recession elevated the number of Ohioans who want jobs but are not seeking to be part of the workforce, and the state's official unemployment rate would be higher if those people were included.

But there is no consensus on how to find the best alternative number.

Portman was a little high on Ohio’s jobless rate for the BLS categories that include, in his words, ""folks who have stopped looking for work,"" but he was in the ballpark. The U-5 rate puts it at 9.2 percent, and he said ""over 10 percent.""

His figure was actually low for the broadest measure, but that includes people working part-time (less than 35 hours per week) for economic reasons.

Those are important details that help to assess his claim and give it context..

Obama says Romney called Russia our ‘No. 1 enemy’
","
President Barack Obama reminded Americans in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention that he’s also the nation’s commander-in-chief who has made tough decisions in wartime and negotiated delicate diplomatic situations.

His opponent, Obama said, is ""new to foreign policy"" and will drag the country back into old conflicts.

""After all, you don't call Russia our No. 1 enemy -- not Al-Qaida, Russia -- unless you're still stuck in a Cold War mind warp,"" Obama said, alluding to Republican rival Mitt Romney.

We wondered if Romney really did say that Russia is public enemy No. 1.

The hot mic

In March 2012, at a summit in South Korea, Obama was caught in a ""hot mic"" incident. Without realizing he could be overheard, Obama told Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have more ability to negotiate with the Russians about missile defense after the November election.

""On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this, this can be solved, but it’s important for him to give me space,"" Obama was heard telling Medvedev, apparently referring to incoming Russian president Vladi­mir Putin.

""Yeah, I understand,"" Medvedev replied.

Obama then interjected, saying, ""This is my last election. After my election, I have more flexibility.""

The exchange drew swift rebuke from Republicans, who accused Obama of caving on an important security issue.

GOP lawmakers favor a strong missile defense system that protects the continental U.S., while Russia opposes the U.S. enhancing its defense systems in Europe.

Romney quickly joined the chorus of critics.

In a March 26 interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN, he criticized Obama for changing tactics on missile defense and nuclear weapons development, and said the president seemed to be willing to negotiate with Russians on matters he was hiding from the American people.

Said Romney: ""This is without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe. They fight for every cause for the world's worst actors. The idea that he has more flexibility in mind for Russia is very, very troubling indeed.""

Blitzer asked Romney if he thought Russia is a bigger foe than Iran, China or North Korea.

""I'm saying in terms of a geopolitical opponent, the nation that lines up with the world's worst actors,"" Romney said. ""Of course the greatest threat that the world faces is a nuclear Iran, and a nuclear North Korea is already troubling enough. But when these terrible actors pursue their course in the world and we go to the United Nations looking for ways to stop them ... who is it that always stands up with the world's worst actors? It's always Russia, typically with China alongside. And so in terms of a geopolitical foe, a nation that's on the Security Council that has the heft of the Security Council, and is of course is a massive nuclear power, Russia is the geopolitical foe.""

The op-ed

Romney followed that interview a day later with an op-ed in Foreign Policy magazine.

In that piece, he never used the word ""enemy"" or ""foe"" to describe Russia. But he did depict it as an adversary and referred to its ""intransigence.""

""Without extracting meaningful concessions from Russia, (Obama) abandoned our missile defense sites in Poland. He granted Russia new limits on our nuclear arsenal. He capitulated to Russia's demand that a United Nations resolution on the Iranian nuclear-weapons program exclude crippling sanctions,"" Romney wrote. ""Moscow has rewarded these gifts with nothing but obstructionism at the United Nations on a whole raft of issues. It has continued to arm the regime of Syria's vicious dictator and blocked multilateral efforts to stop the ongoing carnage there. Across the board, it has been a thorn in our side on questions vital to America's national security. For three years, the sum total of President Obama's policy toward Russia has been: ‘We give, Russia gets.’""

Later, on a multi-nation trip in July designed to beef up his foreign policy credentials, Romney condemned Russia as a ""country where the desire to be free is met with brutal oppression.""

The later interview

Romney spoke again to CNN’s Blitzer in July. Romney’s campaign pointed us to this exchange:

Blitzer: ""The last time you and I spoke in an interview, you told me that Russia was America’s No. 1 geostrategic foe. Do you still believe that?""

Romney: ""There's no question but that in terms of geopolitics -- I’m talking about votes at the United Nations and actions of a geopolitical nature -- Russia is the No. 1 adversary in that regard. That doesn't make them an enemy. It doesn’t make them a combatant. They don't represent the No. 1 national security threat. The No. 1 national security threat, of course, to our nation is a nuclear Iran. Time continues to pass. They continue to move towards nuclearization. This is more and more disconcerting and dangerous to the world. But Russia -- particularly look at a place like Syria. Russia has supported the Assad regime even as it has been attacking its own people. Russia likewise has been slow to move to the kinds of sanctions that have been called for in Iran. Russia is a geopolitical adversary, but it's not an enemy with, you know, missiles being fired at one another or things of that nature.""

Our ruling

In his convention speech, Obama claimed threat Romney called Russia ""our No. 1 enemy.""

Romney didn’t use those exact words, but he did refer to Russia as ""without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe."" He said the Russians ""fight for every cause for the world's worst actors"" in a CNN interview. In a later interview, however, Romney softened his language, this time calling Russia our ""No. 1 adversary"" in terms of UN votes and emphasized it’s not an enemy of the kind launching missiles at American shores.

That’s an important clarification, but it’s worth noting that five months passed before Romney walked back his earlier remarks. Obama’s statement lacked that context but was still largely accurate about Romney’s original description of Russia.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama said he's cut taxes for 'middle-class families, small businesses'
","
In his speech at the Democratic National Committee in Charlotte, N.C., President Barack Obama mocked Republicans for turning to tax cuts as the solution to every problem.

""Have a surplus? Try a tax cut. Deficit too high? Try another. Feel a cold coming on? Take two tax cuts, roll back some regulations, and call us in the morning!"" Obama said.

""Now, I’ve cut taxes for those who need it – middle-class families and small businesses.  But I don’t believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs to our shores, or pay down our deficit,"" Obama said.

Obama is often accused by Republicans of raising taxes, and he has raised some taxes during his presidency. He’s also said that he intends to raise income tax rates for couples who make more than $250,000 a year or single people who make more than $200,000 a year.

Here, we’re going to look at his claim to cut taxes for ""middle-class families and small businesses."" (We’ve been tracking all of Obama’s campaign promises about taxes on our Obameter.)

Obama has signed off on two major tax cuts for middle-class families: the Making Work Pay tax credit that was part of the economic stimulus of 2009 and a temporary reduction in Social Security payroll taxes that went into effect in 2011.

As part of the stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, single workers collected a $400 tax credit, and working couples got $800. The credit didn’t come in the form of a check; it worked out so that most workers had about $400 less in federal income taxes withheld from their paychecks spread out over the entire year.

Most workers received a tax cut under that plan, with the exception of some high earners. The tax cuts phased out for couples who make more than $250,000 or a single person making over $200,000, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center .
       
The result mirrored what Obama promised he would do on the campaign. Obama pledged tax cuts of $500 for each worker and $1,000 for working couples. We rated the promise a Compromise on our Obameter because the resulting tax cut was a little lower than what Obama wanted.

That tax cut expired at the end of 2011. But Obama won another round of tax cuts for most workers in a December 2010 tax deal with Republicans in Congress. Those tax cuts -- a temporary reduction in worker’s payroll taxes, worth about 2 percent of total earnings -- expire in 2013. Again, the tax cut didn’t come as a check, but gives workers a little more in their paychecks than they would have otherwise.

Obama also has passed an array of tax cuts for small businesses.

Eight of them were included in the stimulus, the Affordable Care Act (also known as the health care law), and the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (also known as the HIRE Act). Among the cuts were the exclusion of up to 75 percent of capital gains on key small business investments; a tax credit for the cost of health insurance for small business employees and new tax credits for hiring Americans out of work for at least two months.
       
Another eight cuts came via the Small Business Jobs Act, signed by Obama in September of 2010. These included: adding deductions for business cell phone use; creating a new deduction for health care costs for the self-employed; allowing greater deductions for business start-up expenses; eliminating taxes on all capital gains from key small business investments, and raising the small business expense limit to $500,000.
   
Three months later, the president signed a tax bill that raised the expense limit to 100 percent of small business new investments until the end of 2011. It also extended the elimination of capital gains taxes for small business investments through the end of 2012. (For more details, see our previous fact-check that provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses; we rated it Mostly True.)

To be clear, this doesn’t mean the middle-class and small businesses haven’t seen any tax increases under the Obama administration. We rated his campaign promise that no family making less than $250,000 will see ""any form of tax increase"" as Promise Broken. Obama has signed off on new taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning. His health care law includes a tax penalty for people who don’t buy health insurance; that starts in 2014. (It includes hardship exemptions for people who can’t find affordable policies.)

Also, under the health care law, small businesses that have more than 50 employees that don’t offer their employees health insurance could face fines.

 Our ruling

Obama has raised some taxes during his presidency, but he’s also pursued broad-based tax cuts for the middle class and small businesses. We particularly give weight here to the tax cuts that were part of the stimulus and the payroll tax holiday, which reduced taxes for broad swaths of the workforce. Some small businesses may have been hit by new taxes that were part of Obama’s health law, but these would depend on the particular circumstances of each business. Also, there were new taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning.

Obama said he has ""cut taxes for those who need it – middle-class families, small businesses."" He has, but he also has raised some taxes. So while his statement is accurate, it lacks that additional context. We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/sep/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-hes-cut-taxes-middle-class-famil/

Obama says his budget plan will cut deficits by $4 trillion
","
Editor’s note: After we published this item, we were alerted that our description of the position of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget contained incomplete information. We reviewed that description, interviewed the committee’s staff again, made changes, and re-published our report on Sept. 19, 2012. The text of our original report is archived here. The ruling remains Half True.
   
Republicans have used the government’s growing deficits as a cudgel to drive Democrats out of office. The strategy worked well in 2010 and, with the nation’s total debt having hit $16 trillion, they are using it again.
   
Democrats say they, too, are working to reduce the deficits. In his speech at the Democratic convention, Barack Obama said he will put the country on a path to better fiscal health. He spoke of the choice this election offers voters and said ""You can choose a future where we reduce our deficit without wrecking our middle class.  Independent analysis shows that my plan would cut our deficits by $4 trillion.""
   
The president made the same claim in a television ad. We rated it Half True.
   
The independent analysis the Obama campaign relied on back then came from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. Looking at a 10-year horizon, the center estimated that the president’s combination of spending cuts and tax increases would lower deficits by $3.8 trillion over the decade. That total included $1.7 trillion in reductions that the president and Congress agreed to in 2011.
   
According to the center, about 46 percent would come from higher revenues; about 54 percent of the reductions would come through spending cuts.
   
Obama’s plan is detailed and complex. To raise revenues, families making over $250,000 a year would pay more, but he also has an extensive list of tax breaks he would eliminate. They can be arcane. For example: 
    • Repeal last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories
    • Determine the foreign tax credit on a pooling basis
    • Repeal lower-of-cost-or-market inventory accounting method
    • Eliminate special treatment of carried interest
   
On the spending side, the president proposes $580 billion in cuts to a number of programs that range from agricultural subsidies to rental assistance to airport construction. In 2011, Obama proposed some $320 billion in health program cuts. The federal government would pay less to drug makers and nursing homes. In the long run, many states would shoulder a larger share of Medicaid costs.

Changing Baselines
   
The Obama campaign claims that over 10 years, it would trim deficits by $4 trillion. Many assumptions lie behind that statement, but the most important question is, compared to what?
   
No budget projection makes sense unless it’s measured against some baseline. A baseline is an analyst’s best guess as to what the deficit would be if things were left to themselves.
Changes in tax law, government spending, and economic growth are just some of the major factors that drive baseline estimates.
   
The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, looked at the president’s 2013 budget and concluded that it would increase the cumulative deficit by $3.5 trillion over its baseline between now and 2022. That greatly undercuts Obama’s argument that he is saving money.
   
But the CBO baseline assumed that all of the Bush tax cuts and other tax breaks would expire. It assumed that Congress would stick to the spending caps in the deficit reduction law it passed to avoid a government default. Many, if not most, analysts  doubt that the CBO baseline is realistic.
   
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization focused on debt reduction, has its own baseline. Unlike the CBO, it assumes that congress will find a way around the deepest budget cuts and that it will extend the tax cuts to some degree.
   
Using the baseline developed by the committee, the president’s budget plan looks much better. Jason Peuquet, the committee’s research director, says it delivers about $2.4 trillion in new savings.

In order to get to $4 trillion, you need to add the savings that stem from spending cuts in 2011, both from the budget deal and earlier in the year. Obama includes those in his tally but they did not originate with his budget proposal.

Peuquet warns that all numbers like these ""can be gamed."" His group thinks the more important goal is to get deficits headed down relative to the size of the economy. On those terms, he says the president’s plan is a good start but does not go far enough.
   
Our ruling
   
Obama says his plan will cut deficits by $4 trillion. 
On its own, Obama’s plan does not produce the full $4 trillion. Both the source cited by the Obama campaign and a separate group, one that puts a premium on deficit reduction, say the president’s plan will shrink the cumulative gap between spending and revenues by well over $2 trillion over ten years.

The remainder comes from the 10-year impact of cuts already approved.

To the extent that long term predictions hold up, the president’s big number is accurate, but he takes credit for changes that took place outside of his budget proposal.
