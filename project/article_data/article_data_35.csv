No, Facebook’s recent logout glitch is not related to its off-Facebook tracking tool
","Scores of Facebook users found themselves unexpectedly logged out of the social media app recently, causing confusion, with people frantically trying to remember their long-forgotten passwords. But while Facebook says the glitch was due to a system change, posts on well, Facebook, pointed to a more insidious reason: ""Who got logged off Facebook last night?"" a post shared Jan. 23 says. ""Want to know why??? Facebook updated last night with a new feature. They can now track ‘OFF FACEBOOK ACTIVITY,’ bank accounts, email, apps.... To turn it off go into your Facebook Settings, scroll down to OFF FACEBOOK ACTIVITY, then click CLEAR HISTORY then click MORE OPTIONS then MANAGE FUTURE ACTIVITY and turn off FUTURE ACTIVITY."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It isn’t accurate. Here’s what happened. On Jan. 22, Facebook said it was looking into reports of people being logged out of their accounts, receiving a ""session expired"" notification before being prompted to log back in. The company confirmed the following morning that engineers had fixed the issue.  ""On January 22, a configuration change caused some people to be logged out of their Facebook accounts. We investigated the issue and fixed it for everyone on January 23. We’re sorry for the inconvenience,"" a Facebook company spokesperson told PolitiFact in an email. Technology news website Engadget found that iPhone owners were most affected by the glitch and that people using two-factor authentication were having the most trouble, as the SMS codes needed to log back in were taking a long time to reach users.  Facebook confirmed that its ""Off-Facebook Activity"" tracker has nothing to do with the logout issues, and is not part of a new update. It’s been available on the website for exactly one year. And it does not give Facebook the ability to track your bank account or email activity, as the post claims. It’s a tool offered to users, not an advertising tool itself. The tracker enables users to have more insight into how the company traces them online. Businesses send Facebook information about a user’s activity on their websites, and Facebook uses that information to show relevant ads in their newsfeed.  The Off-Facebook Activity tool now allows users to see a summary of that data and clear it from their accounts if they choose to, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a January 2020 blog post.  The tracker shows 180 days’ worth of data collected by Facebook. Besides clearing that history, users can also tell Facebook to stop adding data from their accounts by clicking ""Manage Future Activity"" and then toggling off the button next to ""Future Off-Facebook Activity,"" according to the Washington Post. Quick warning: Turning off your off-Facebook activity will mean losing access to apps and websites that you’ve used Facebook to login to in the past. Changing these settings doesn’t stop Facebook from gathering data from other businesses, it simply ""disconnects"" that data from your profile, which mostly means the company won’t use it to target you with ads. Some Facebook users who were recently logged out of their accounts claim that the company did it purposely to install an off-Facebook tracker that accesses their bank accounts, emails and more. This is wrong. The forced logouts were due to a system change glitch and has nothing to do with the company’s Off-Facebook tracker. The tool allows users to see how the company traces their activity on the internet and has been on the social media website since January 2020. We rate this False. ",/factchecks/2021/jan/28/facebook-posts/no-facebooks-recent-logout-glitch-not-related-its-/

Biden did not admit he’s ‘governing like a dictator’
","Some outspoken critics of Joe Biden are using the president’s words against him to criticize the flurry of executive orders he signed after Inauguration Day. In a Jan. 26 Instagram post, Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative advocacy group Turning Point USA, published a clip of Biden speaking on stage about executive action. Text over the video says: ""Joe Biden admits he is governing like a ‘dictator.’"" ""34+ Executive Orders in less than a week and we’re supposed to believe that *Trump* was the one who governed like a dictator?"" Kirk wrote in a caption. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) It has more than 91,000 likes, and we’ve seen several similar posts get thousands of shares on Facebook. (Screenshot from Instagram) Since taking office Jan. 20, Biden has published 21 executive orders aimed at undoing the policies of the Trump administration, not including proclamations and memoranda. We’ve seen several posts on Facebook that criticize Biden’s actions in light of his past comments about executive orders, so we wanted to take a closer look at this video. Kirk’s claim — that Biden ""admits he is governing like a 'dictator’"" — is not literally true. The post misconstrues the president’s past comments on using executive orders to change federal tax policy, which Biden has not tried to do. The video comes from an October ABC News town hall in the final weeks of the presidential election campaign. During the event, Biden answered questions from host George Stephanopoulos and an audience member about his plan to raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy. Here’s a transcript of the relevant portion of his remarks: Stephanopoulos: So, there's not going to be any delay on the tax increases? Biden: No, well, I've got to get the votes. I got to get the votes. That's why — you know, the one thing that I — I have this strange notion. We are a democracy. Some of my Republican friends, and some of my Democratic friends even, occasionally say, ""Well, if you can't get the votes, by executive order you're going to do something."" (There are) things you can't do by executive order, unless you're a dictator. We're a democracy. We need consensus. Stephanopoulos: We've got to take a quick break. We'll be right back. A video of the exchange shows that Biden, who was a U.S. senator for 36 years, was pushing back on the idea that he could quickly change major federal policies via executive order, including raising tax rates.  Biden was not criticizing all executive orders as hallmarks of a dictatorship — the full context of his statement suggests that he believes an executive order on taxes would be an inappropriate use of executive power in a democracy. Biden has not issued orders on tax policy. Article I of the Constitution grants Congress the power to ""lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States."" The 16th Amendment gives Congress the power to collect income taxes. Presidents do have broad authority to pursue their tax agenda without the approval of Congress, including by deferring tax payments and appointing agency heads. But experts say presidents rarely try to change tax policy single handedly.     ""Instead, the president often asks Congress to pass revenue-raising measures achieving what the president and his Treasury Department already could accomplish on their own,"" Daniel J. Hemel, a law professor at the University of Chicago, wrote in a 2017 paper for the Cornell Law Review. ""And even when Congress rebuffs the president’s request, past administrations only rarely have responded by exercising the regulatory authority they already possess."" None of the executive orders that Biden has published so far have to do with changing federal tax policy. Nine issued in the first two days address the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, while others undo some of the policies implemented by the Trump administration. One order temporarily halting deportations was blocked by a federal judge in Texas. Meanwhile, Biden plans to send major proposals on policies like immigration reform to Congress. Democratic control of both chambers gives Biden more leeway in pursuing his agenda, including a potential future tax plan. However, Biden has not yet introduced tax reform legislation, and his $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus proposal does not include any tax increases. We reached out to Turning Point USA and the White House for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Kirk’s Instagram post is inaccurate. We rate it False.

The U.S. is the only industrialized nation with no paid family leave plan
","Sweeping legislation that would have established a paid family leave program for Virginia employees was recently killed in the state Senate. The bill, introduced by Sen. Jennifer Boysko (D-Fairfax) would have established a wage tax in 2024 to finance up to 12 weeks of annual paid leave time for workers at 80% of their regular earnings. Eligible were employees: Caring for a new child the first year after birth, adoption or foster placement; Experiencing or caring for a family member with serious health problems; Caring for the family of a deployed service member. Boysko, during a Jan. 18 hearing of the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee, said the bill would make Virginia a national leader on the issue. ""The United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place,"" she said.   Boysko’s comparison of America to the rest of the industrialized nations is a familiar Democratic talking point. Former President Barack Obama has made it; so has Vermont Sen.  Bernie Sanders and New York Sen. Kristen Gillibrand.  What America has Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, employers with 50 or more workers must allow parents 12 weeks of job-protected leave annually to care for a newborn. While this means those individuals can take the time off without fear of losing their job, in most cases the leave is unpaid. There are a few exceptions. Eight states offer paid family leave through employee-paid payroll taxes: California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New York, Washington, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Oregon, as well as the District of Columbia. Some employers choose to provide paid maternity leave, but that touches only about 16% of private industry workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. What other countries have The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development studied paid maternity leave for 36 OECD countries -- developed nations  -- and five additional European Union countries and Costa Rica. On average across OECD countries in 2018, mothers were entitled to 51 weeks of paid leave after child birth. The United States was the only country in the study with no national law to provide that benefit. According to a 2014 report by the International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations, the United States and New Guinea were the only countries out of 170 that provided no cash benefits of any kind to women during maternity leave. Of 41 developed countries highlighted by the report, the U.S. also mandated the shortest period of time off — 12 weeks. The 12-week law is still in effect. Back to Virginia Boysko’s bill drew bipartisan opposition in the Senate committee and died on a 12-3 vote. Critics voiced concern that the wage tax was not clearly defined - the uncertain amount of the levy would be set after a determination of the revenues needed to support the leave program - and that the levy would impose financial hardships on small businesses and workers. The Senate, however, has expressed interest in taking a deeper look at the issue. It passed a bill instructing the State Corporation Commission to make recommendations this fall for establishing a plan that would encourage Virginia employers to voluntarily offer 12 weeks of paid family leave. The measure is pending in the House of Delegates. Jurisprudence PolitiFact National has given Mostly True ratings to statements of Obama in 2015 and Gillibrand in 2016 that the U.S. is the only industrialized nation that doesn’t ""guarantee"" paid family leave. The slight flaw in their statements was that there were exclusions to the programs in some countries, so the benefit was not universal. In Canada, for example, temporary workers in 2016 couldn’t get cash benefits. Canada also excluded migrant workers and people who owned more than 40% of their business. Norway and Switzerland excluded home workers.  Boysko’s statement is different. She does not say ""guarantee."" She says the U.S. is the only industrialized nation that does not ""have a paid family medical leave program in place."" All other industrialized nations do have family leave programs in place, although some of those plans do not ""guarantee"" all workers are covered.  Our ruling Boysko said, ""The United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place."" All other developed countries surveyed by the International Labor Organization have programs mandating at least some paid maternity leave. An international study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found the same thing. The benefit is not available to all workers in some countries, but Boysko doesn’t claim that it is. So we rate her statement True.  ",/factchecks/2021/jan/28/jennifer-boysko/us-only-industrialized-nation-no-paid-family-leave/

Steineke’s actions, words don’t match on COVID-19 bill
","After going through the last eight months of 2020 without passing a single bill, Wisconsin’s Republican-led Legislature is taking another run at addressing the coronavirus pandemic. The Legislature was at odds with Democratic Gov. Tony Evers throughout the past year, and rebuffed numerous attempts by Evers to force them into session.  But the state Senate signaled a potential move toward the middle when it passed a coronavirus relief package Jan. 12, 2021, that had been negotiated with Evers. Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, said that bill ""addresses the critically-important needs of school districts, non-profit organizations, and small employers."" Evers called that bill — an amended version of an Assembly bill — ""a good faith effort in compromise and bipartisanship"" and urged the Assembly to pass it as amended and send it to his desk for a signature. Instead, the Assembly added back in many of the elements the Senate had removed, passing their own version on Jan. 26. This new version now goes back to the Senate, which must decide whether it’s close enough to their version to approve. If approved, Evers would have to decide whether he is comfortable signing it as well. Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, R-Kaukauna, touted the bill this way on Twitter: ""Here in Madison, you learn quickly that give and take is needed to get things done,"" Steineke said. ""Assembly Republicans have come to the table and made concessions to get this much-needed relief to hard-working Wisconsin families."" This paints a picture of a back-and-forth where Assembly Republicans worked with the other side to reach a consensus. Is that really what happened? Let’s take a closer look at how Steineke’s words and actions line up. We’re coming out of a year in which the Wisconsin Legislature did less than almost any other state legislative body to address the ongoing pandemic, even though it is one of just 10 full-time legislatures in the nation.  The Legislature has passed no bills on the topic since mid-April, when both bodies passed wide-ranging legislation addressing unemployment, health care, education and government procedures, many of which applied only during the first public health emergency that Evers declared in March. The state Senate moved to block this partisan logjam in negotiating with Evers — a step that was rarely taken between the legislative and executive branches in 2020 — by producing the compromise bill. The Republican-run Senate passed the bill 29-2, and Evers promised to sign it. The Assembly, which had expected the Senate to pass its original version, balked at the changes. Their updated version doesn’t restore all the elements of the original, but it does add back in elements the Senate removed amid its negotiations with Evers.  In short, the Assembly rejected the Senate’s bipartisan deal that Evers would have signed in favor of its own version that ""fights for the conservative ideals we know are important to our constituents throughout the state,"" as Steineke phrased it in another tweet. Alesha Emmert, a spokeswoman for Steineke, said Jan. 26 the ""give and take"" he referenced was with his own party. She said Republican leaders of the Assembly and Senate ""discussed amendment language ahead of today’s floor period to see if common ground could be achieved."" But LeMahieu, the Senate leader, disputed that characterization. ""We are concerned that the changes that the Assembly made will cause the governor to veto the bill, and all along we wanted to make sure that we produced a bill that the governor could sign and would address the needs of Wisconsin,"" LeMahieu told WisPolitics.com after the Assembly vote. And Britt Cudaback, a spokeswoman for Gov. Tony Evers, said the Assembly didn’t work with Evers on their new version of the coronavirus bill. After the Assembly ignored a Senate-backed compromise to pass its own coronavirus bill, Steineke said, ""Here in Madison, you learn quickly that give and take is needed to get things done,"" claiming Assembly Republicans had ""come to the table"" and compromised. This characterization of the Assembly action is disingenuous at best. Steineke’s verbiage referencing compromise — typically used to refer to politicians from opposing parties finding a middle ground — doesn’t reference bipartisanship at all. Evers wasn’t part of this process. And whatever negotiations occurred between the GOP leaders of the Senate and Assembly, this description clearly overreaches given LeMahieu’s immediate criticism of the result. That’s not getting things done, and it’s not in line with Steineke’s ""give and take"" description. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jan/27/jim-steineke/steinekes-actions-words-dont-match-covid-19-bill/

Bill Gates didn’t say ‘3 billion people need to die’ to reverse climate change
","A viral video on Instagram falsely claims Bill Gates wants billions of people to die. The video, published Jan. 25 by Philadelphia pundit Umar Johnson, starts with a selfie video of someone speaking in a car and imploring his audience to watch the upcoming video. Then, it transitions to a TikTok clip of a man speaking into a microphone behind a laptop. ""There’s too many people on the planet we need to get rid of. In the words of Bill Gates, at least 3 billion people need to die,"" the man says. ""So we’ll just start off in Africa, we’ll start doing our research there and we’ll eliminate more of the Africans because they’re deplorable, they’re worthless, they’re not part of this world economy."" ""21st Century Afrikan Holocaust,"" Johnson wrote in his caption. The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) It has more than 497,000 views. (Screenshot from Instagram) Since the coronavirus pandemic began, Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and a billionaire philanthropist, has been a frequent target of disinformation. So we wanted to take a closer look at whether he said something close to what’s in this video. The post is inaccurate — Gates never said 3 billion people should die to stave off the effects of climate change. Other fact-checkers have debunked the viral claim. The clip comes from a video uploaded to YouTube in November 2019 by the International Tribunal for Natural Justice, a group that has aired false claims that 5G technology helps the coronavirus spread. The video features testimony from Robert O. Young, a man who claims to have ""successful treatments to cure cancer."" Young’s work is based on the theory that acidity is the cause of all disease and that an alkaline diet is the cure. In 2017, he was sentenced for practicing medicine without a license in California. In September 2020, the Federal Trade Commission sent Young a warning letter for making a variety of ""unsubstantiated claims for coronavirus prevention and treatment"" on his websites. Young’s comments about Gates start about an hour and a half into the video. Later, he says international health agencies are ""using chemical warfare against all of us."" Young also likens vaccines to poison. Vaccines have saved millions of lives over the years. Young’s comments about Gates take something the billionaire said about climate change out of context. In 2010, Gates gave a TED Talk on energy and climate change. During the presentation, he lays out four factors that could help countries zero out their carbon dioxide emissions. One of them is population. ""The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about 9 billion,"" he said. ""Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15%. But there, we see an increase of about 1.3 (billion)."" Gates wasn’t talking about decreasing the population — he was talking about decreasing its rate of growth.  In their 2014 annual letter, Bill and Melinda Gates wrote that there is a strong positive correlation between infant mortality and birth rates. They argue that decreasing infant mortality rate by expanding access to health care and education could lead to slower population growth over time. ""When children are well-nourished, fully vaccinated, and treated for common illnesses like diarrhea, malaria, and pneumonia, the future gets a lot more predictable,"" the letter says. ""Parents start making decisions based on the reasonable expectation that their children will live."" We found no evidence that Bill Gates has advocated for the death of 3 billion people in African countries. The Gates Foundation told PolitiFact that the claim is false. In fact, Gates makes clear in the 2014 report that he does not support letting people die to slow population growth. ""We make the future sustainable when we invest in the poor, not when we insist on their suffering,"" the letter says. The Instagram post is inaccurate. We rate it False.

How Joe Biden’s first executive orders compare with past presidents
","Sen. Marco Rubio, R. Fla., claimed that President Joe Biden talks like a centrist, but is ""governing like someone from the far-left."" ""He has issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone,"" Rubio said in a video. Is that true? Rubio tweeted the video shortly before 8 a.m. Jan. 22, so we evaluated Rubio’s claim based on actions Biden had taken up to that point (Jan. 20-21). Setting aside the political implications of the word ""fiat,"" we found that available evidence supports Rubio’s assessment: Biden’s use of the executive power in his first two days far outpaced that of his predecessors. Rubio’s office did not respond to our requests for information.     The total number of presidential directives signed by Biden during his first two days in office is greater than the number signed by Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama over the same period. Biden issued 17 executive orders on his first two days in office, compared with Trump who issued one and Obama who issued two. Biden issued three proclamations, while Trump and Obama each issued one. Executive orders state how to manage the operations of the executive branch of the federal government. Proclamations communicate information on holidays, commemorations, special observances, trade, and policy. The Office of the Federal Register numbers each executive order and proclamation consecutively as part of a series and publishes them in the daily Federal Register after the White House sends over the information. Other presidential documents, such as memoranda and notices, are not numbered but are also published. The Office of the Federal Register is in the process of digitizing documents published prior to 1994. So we were unable to use that source to compare Biden’s actions with all other presidents. We turned instead to the American Presidency Project, a nonpartisan source of presidential documents hosted at the University of California, Santa Barbara. If Rubio was referring to a president’s first two days in office (instead of any two-day period), the available documents show that he is correct dating back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose first inauguration was in 1933, said Gerhard Peters, a political science professor at Citrus College and co-director of the American Presidency Project. The available record before FDR isn’t complete enough to say definitively whether Rubio is also right about earlier presidents, but experts said it’s likely that his claim still holds. ""Before FDR, presidents simply did not charge into office as prepared for action,"" said John Woolley, co-director of American Presidency Project and professor emeritus of political science at UCSB. ""Even Lincoln, judging by the record assembled by (his secretaries John G. Nicolay and John Hay), did not fire off as many orders as Biden despite there already being an active revolt in progress."" Rubio used the word ""fiat"" — a politicized term that would suggest Biden rushed in sweeping and long-lasting policy changes. However, Biden in his first two days issued 10 executive orders and one memorandum to address a specific issue that’s actively affecting the entire nation: the coronavirus pandemic. Biden was sworn into office around the time the United States recorded about 400,000 deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Here’s a rundown of those specific actions: Executive order mandating use of masks on federal property Executive order creating the position of COVID-19 response coordinator Executive order requiring masks in all forms of public transportation Executive order to develop and expand access to COVID-19 treatments Executive order to improve the collection and sharing of COVID-19 data Executive order to secure supplies necessary for responding to the pandemic Executive order to ensure equitable pandemic response and recovery Executive order to support the reopening and continuing operation of schools Executive order to protect workers from COVID-19 under the Occupational Safety and Health Act Executive order establishing the COVID-19 Pandemic Testing Board Memorandum extending federal support to governors’ use of the National Guard in their COVID-19 response ""No one would doubt the need for executive action to deal with an overwhelming health crisis, so this crisis situation makes this a unique point in time,"" said John Frendreis, a professor emeritus of political science at Loyola University Chicago. ""Rubio’s comment is technically correct, although when taken together with the context, it is exaggerated."" Besides those COVID-19 measures, Biden’s actions included an order requiring an ethics pledge from his appointees and directives revoking several of Trump’s policies. It’s become more common for presidents to issue executive actions and for the other party to dislike it, said Daniel Gitterman, a public policy professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""When it’s the president of the opposite party, they call it executive fiat, and when it’s the president of the same party, they call it bold action,"" Gitterman said. According to the Federal Register, Trump signed 220 executive orders during his four years in office. Throughout their eight-year administrations, Obama signed 276 executive orders and George W. Bush signed 291. Rubio said Biden ""has issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone."" Fiats"" is a politically loaded term and ignores that many of Biden’s directives were specific to the ongoing pandemic. Still, the available evidence on the number of directives issued supports Rubio’s claim. We rate it True. RELATED: Which campaign promises did Joe Biden tackle first?

No, Biden’s Rolex didn’t belong to his late son Beau
","Joe Biden wore a Rolex to his inauguration as the 46th U.S. president.  Hubbub over the timepiece began when the New York Times ran a story on Jan. 22 about the luxury watch that highlighted its steep price — nearly $8,000 — and said it runs counter to Biden’s just-a-regular-guy persona.  The article was met with swift backlash from liberal voices online and a false online narrative about the watch’s origins. ""You remember that stupid-a-- New York Times story criticizing @joebiden for having a Rolex?"" a post on Facebook reads. ""Turns out the watch @potus wore to the swearing-in belonged to Beau Biden. It was in honor of his dead son."" The post features a photo of Beau wearing a similar watch. But the watch didn’t belong to Beau. It was gifted to Biden by first lady Jill Biden.     The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

It’s unclear if Beau’s ownership of a similar watch was a factor in its selection.  The New York Times article, which ran in the fashion section of the paper, mentions that recent presidents opted to wear cheaper, ""everyman"" timepieces to avoid looking flashy. (President Donald Trump commonly wore a yellow gold Rolex, along with other expensive watches.)  But it also acknowledged that Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B.

Trump vaccine plan left logistics to states, but it did exist
","President Joe Biden’s chief of staff Ron Klain criticized the Trump administration’s vaccination campaign as ""chaotic,"" adding Biden will work more closely with states to get vaccines into arms. On Meet the Press, Chuck Todd asked Klain about conflicting comments by Biden officials about whether the new administration had to create a vaccination distribution plan from scratch.  Klain said Biden was building on progress from the initial wave of vaccinations, ""no question about it."" ""But the process to distribute the vaccine, particularly outside of nursing homes and hospitals out into the community as a whole did not really exist when we came into the White House,"" Klain said. Really? We found that’s taking things too far. Many experts said that the Trump administration’s plan had some key holes, including a failure to communicate with the states and cities about the rollout and inadequate funding for vaccine distribution. But it did have a plan: rely on the states. ""The federal plan, much like the rest of the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic, was very hands off when it comes to details of implementing public health interventions,"" said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""The last mile of vaccine delivery was not a big part of the federal plan by design."" We asked Michael R. Fraser, CEO of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, if the Trump administration had a plan for vaccine distribution. ""It is all in what you mean by ‘plan,"" Fraser said. ""If you mean a tactical guidebook on how to do vaccination from A to Z, no, there is no federal plan.""  Prakash Nagarkatti, vice president for research at the University of South Carolina, told USA Today that ""there was total lack of planning at the state level for mass vaccination, and the federal government did not help the states overcome the hurdles."" In September, the Trump administration announced a general strategy to distribute the vaccine which included deliveries to states and, later, pharmacy chains. A partnership with CVS and Walgreens administered vaccines in some long-term care facilities.  The closest thing to a federal plan was the playbook the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave states to help them create their own distribution plans. States wrote broad plans and submitted them in October. They lacked important details , such as how many doses they would get and when. (At the time, no vaccines were approved.) Without dollars to make them happen, state plans were essentially wish lists, Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, said on a podcast. It wasn’t until December that Congress approved a COVID-19 package with $8 billion for vaccine distribution.  At the same time, it’s clear there was some level of coordination. The U.S. would not have been able to give shots to millions of people, enroll tens of thousands of private providers, and set up a data collection system tying in all 50 states if the federal and state governments had done no planning. ""To say there wasn’t planning is not accurate,"" Hannan told PolitiFact. ""However, I don’t think there was communication from the federal government about the plan, about the vision, about how things would work."" A couple of days after Klain’s interview, Biden offered a softened take on the work of the Trump administration. ""We want to give credit to everyone involved in this vaccine effort and the prior administration and the science community and the medical sphere … for getting the program off the ground,"" Biden said Jan. 26. ""And that credit is absolutely due."" But Biden said that once he took office, he found that the vaccine program was in worse shape than he expected.  The Biden administration has envisioned a more prominent federal role, including setting up  100 vaccine centers across the nation by the end of February. Officials say the biggest roadblock is lack of vaccine supply. Biden announced that his administration aims to purchase enough doses to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of the summer or beginning of the fall. While the philosophical approach to federal involvement is different, ""you can’t say absence of plan when the plan isn't the one you would have created,"" said KFF’s Michaud. The Washington Post reported that Biden’s advisers inherited something ""more like a black box than a bare cupboard — the result of fractured communication among federal, state and local officials and a juggling act between manufacturers making a new product and thousands of providers, from big hospital systems to tiny clinics, struggling to plan around an unknown amount of vaccine."" As of Jan. 26, about 20 million people had received their first dose and about 3.5 million had received a second dose, according to the CDC. About 44 million doses had been distributed. The main challenge that states now face is they only know how many doses they are getting a few days in advance. Most state officials have said they could deliver double or triple the number of shots if they had a larger supply. ""The story here is the supply, not needing a plan,"" Fraser said. Klain said, ""The process to distribute the vaccine, particularly outside of nursing homes and hospitals out into the community as a whole, did not really exist when we came into the White House."" Klain was focusing his criticism on the phase of getting vaccinations into the arms of the general public, not the initial phase of vaccinating health care workers and workers and residents of long-term care facilities. The Trump administration’s approach to distributing the vaccine was to give it to locations chosen by the states and to let them take it from there. There are many criticisms of this process, including that it took too long to give states money to implement their plans and a lack of communication from the top about how the rollout would work. But that was the plan they drew up. Saying there a plan ""does not really exist"" is beyond saying a plan is lacking. We rate Klain’s claim Mostly False.

NC health officials clarify number of spoiled COVID-19 vaccines
","With North Carolina initially among the slower states to administer coronavirus vaccines, reporters are raising questions about the effectiveness of its rollout. In a press conference on Jan. 21, a reporter asked Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Mandy Cohen how many shots had been misused or gone to waste. ""We as a state don’t want to waste any vaccine. We are seeing very small numbers of vaccine waste recorded in our CVMS system, but it’s very few, like in the tens of doses,"" Cohen responded. Is North Carolina’s spoil number ""very small,"" even ""in the tens?""  The state health department says, on average, it’s receiving reports of fewer than 10 spoiled doses per provider. However, the total number of spoiled doses is in the four digits, not two.  A day after Cohen’s briefing, North Carolina’s health department told the Associated Press that a total of 1,280 doses had been discarded. We asked the department about the comments Cohen made on Thursday. Was she describing the 1,280 number? Had she seen that specific 1,280 figure?  Chris Mackey, the department’s director of communications, said no. Cohen hadn’t seen the specific total when she spoke at that Jan. 21 briefing, Mackey said, because the department didn’t run a report on the numbers until later. Cohen based her comments on ""one-off conversations"" with other health officials. ""We ran a report when someone asked us for it. Mandy didn’t have the number,"" Mackey said in a phone interview. ""She was trying to say we haven’t seen any big incidents of vaccine waste."" The 1,280 spoiled doses account for 0.1% of the 1.1 million doses in the state, the department said in an email.  There are 250 healthcare providers administering the shots, the email said, meaning the losses average out to about five doses per provider. It’s difficult to know how North Carolina’s numbers compare with other states. The CDC has instructed states to report vaccine waste into its tracking system, agency spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund told PolitiFact. However, ProPublica reporters found that some states aren’t tracking their spoiled doses. ""We are working to figure out how to provide this data online in the future when the data is more complete,"" Nordlund said. A 2019 report from the World Health Organization says vaccine waste is expected to be anywhere between 5% and 20% during mass vaccination campaigns.  There are reports of other states losing hundreds of doses in single incidents. Wisconsin received national attention when authorities charged a local pharmacist with deliberately destroying around 500 doses of the vaccine. In Massachusetts, NBC News reported that a Veterans Affairs hospital lost 1,900 doses after a cleaning contractor accidentally unplugged a refrigerator. In Ohio, the Columbus Dispatch reported, a pharmacy spoiled 890 doses by failing to keep them properly stored. In another case, nearly 12,000 doses spoiled on the way to Michigan after the shipping truck got too cold. Cohen said the health department is receiving reports of ""very small numbers of vaccine waste … but it’s very few, like in the tens of doses."" The health department provided clarity on Cohen’s remarks a day later.  It’s fair to say the rate of vaccine spoilage is ""very small"" — a tenth of 1%. However, it was inaccurate for Cohen to say the number was ""in the tens."" The total number was 1,280.

No evidence Trump offered his hotel to National Guard members in parking garages
","In the wake of the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 26,000 National Guard members were sent to Washington to secure President Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20.  The next day, hundreds of Guard members were ordered to vacate the Capitol for several hours and to take rest in nearby parking garages and outdoor areas before being allowed back inside the complex.

No evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine caused Hank Aaron’s death
","Social media users are suggesting that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine caused the death of baseball legend and civil rights advocate Hank Aaron.  ""Hank Aaron - RIP - wanted to be an example and an inspiration to Black People by taking the COVID-19 vaccine. Unfortunately, he may have become a clear example to Black People of why this vaccine CANNOT be trusted,"" reads a Facebook post.  The post was published on Facebook and flagged as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Aaron passed away at the age of 86 on Jan. 22, 2021, two weeks after he had received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  But posts like this one mislead by implying that the vaccine caused Aaron’s death. So far, there’s no evidence of a direct link, and vaccine experts told us to view these claims with caution.  A spokesperson at the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s office, which examined Aaron’s body after his death, told PolitiFact that his cause of death was natural and not linked to the COVID-19 vaccine.  The COVID-19 vaccines have been studied for months and have been proven to be safe and effective in tens of thousands of people. In addition, many of the users suggesting that the Moderna vaccine caused Aaron’s death are doing so without any evidence. ""Unfortunately, there are 86-year-olds who die every day. Thus, a single death in a person of that age group following a more than two-week interval from vaccination does not prove causation,"" said Dr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center. We don’t know specifically how Aaron died. USA Today has reported that Aaron died of a stroke in his sleep.  If Aaron did die of a stroke, that would make it even less likely that the vaccine contributed in some way to his death. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said that it would be ""biologically implausible"" for the COVID-19 vaccine to cause a stroke.  ""The coronavirus can cause strokes, but the (Moderna COVID-19) vaccine only contains one protein of the virus, and there’s no evidence that that one protein is inducing inflammation of the blood vessels (which could cause strokes),"" he said.  The most common way of assessing whether vaccines have negative side effects is by gathering safety data from two groups of people, a vaccinated group and a control group. If a particular symptom is significantly higher in the vaccinated group, then it’s likely that the vaccine causes that symptom. However, if a particular symptom occurs at a similar rate in both the vaccinated and control groups, then the most likely cause is coincidence.  Tens of thousands of people participated in clinical trials last year to make sure the vaccines were safe before rolling them out to the general public. To receive FDA emergency-use authorization, vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna had to follow up with at least half of participants for at least two months after they received their vaccinations. U.S. health experts have been aware of the possibility that deaths following vaccination would be perceived as being linked to the vaccine. In December, Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot, a member of the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said that the likelihood of nursing home patients dying from other causes shortly after vaccination could erode public confidence in the safety of the vaccines.  ""When you are vaccinating millions and millions of people, some will develop bad illnesses and death simply by chance,"" said Orenstein. ""These would be illnesses and deaths that would have occurred anyway at that time even if the person was not vaccinated."" Social media users imply that Hank Aaron’s death was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine. The Fulton County Medical Examiner’s office confirmed that Aaron’s death was not linked to the vaccine. Just because someone dies after receiving a vaccine does not prove that the vaccine caused his death. The COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in tens of thousands of people.

How bad have New York state’s recent population losses been?
","Has New York state seen bigger losses in population from out-migration than any other state? That’s what state Sen. Jim Tedisco said in a press release issued with fellow members of the Senate Republican Conference  On Jan. 5, Senate Republicans unveiled their plan to ""Reset New York State,"" saying they sought to lower taxes, improve local economies and get smarter about addressing the coronavirus pandemic. In the release, Tedisco said that in order for New York to address its economic challenges, the Legislature must first grapple with the pattern of New York residents fleeing the state for other locales.  ""In order to reset New York State by safely restarting our economy, we need to address the elephant in the room that our state government is not talking about: the fact that for the third year in a row, New York leads the nation in outmigration of residents, with 126,000 people leaving last year and over one million in the past decade,"" Tedisco said in the release. ""When enough people who can afford to leave New York State are gone, who will be left to pay for the infrastructure, health care, schools and other necessities?"" New York has indeed experienced population losses over the past decade, we found, but the nature of the losses is not quite as Tedisco suggests. Adam Kramer, Tedisco’s chief of staff and director of communications, directed PolitiFact’s reporters to several articles referring to the total population decline of 126,000 people, but this figure isn’t necessarily tied to domestic out-migration. Kramer cited the U.S. Census Bureau’s new population figures released on Dec. 22, 2020, which show changes between July 2019 and July 2020. The figures show that New York’s population decreased by 126,355 people during that period, or a 0.65% drop from a year earlier. That was the nation’s largest loss of population for that period, with Illinois having the second-biggest loss.  However, it’s important to note that the population loss figure is not necessarily attributable to out-migration to other states. The figure also reflects net international migration and natural increases from births minus deaths, said William Frey, chief demographer at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington. In 2020, deaths could be a significant factor, since New York experienced roughly 25,000 coronavirus deaths during the period reflected in the Census statistics. The Census Bureau has not yet released a more detailed breakdown of population changes from 2019 to 2020, so it’s not clear yet how much of New York’s population loss stems from migration to other states. That said, recent history supports Tedisco claim that New York has experienced significant migration to other states. This brings us to his second assertion. Census data shows that between 2010 and 2019, New York state gained about 75,000 people overall. However, the population losses to other states were substantial — almost 1.38 million people. This was larger than any other state, with California ranking second. The reason for the overall gain is that the domestic losses were more than balanced out by a net gain of 698,000 from international migration and a net gain of more than 758,000 from births minus deaths. The breakdown for domestic out-migration isn’t available yet for 2020, but figures are available for the overall population figure. They show that New York’s small overall population gain from 2010 to 2019 was reversed by 2020, with the state losing almost 117,000 between 2010 and 2020. When Tedisco made his claim, his Republican colleagues largely blamed the state government for the population decline. Sen. Joseph Griffo said in the statement that people are leaving New York because of ""unwelcome policies, burdensome regulations and high taxes,"" while Sen. George Borrello cited ""high taxes, excessive, job-killing regulations, and a rising crime rate"" as reasons for population loss. Tom W. Smith, senior fellow and director of the University of Chicago’s Center for the Study of Politics and Society, said that these factors may help cause out-migration, but he added that other factors can as well, even the prevailing weather. Despite Tedisco’s assertion that out-migration will make it difficult for New York to be able to pay for infrastructure, health care, schools and other necessities in the future, Frey said New York’s population losses aren’t enough to cause that. ""While there may continue to be a negative domestic out-migration from New York, it has not been dramatically different than the past, especially when compared with the early 2000s,"" he said. Tedisco said that ""New York leads the nation in outmigration of residents, with 126,000 people leaving last year and over one million in the past decade."" New York has seen significant population losses for a decade, exceeding the losses in other states. However, he described the one-year loss of 126,000 incorrectly. That figure refers to net population changes for all reasons, including gains from international in-migration and births minus deaths.

Biden did back a long border fence in 2006, but a comparison to 2021 falls short
","Not 30 minutes after President Joe Biden took office, a Facebook post surfaced showing video of him speaking in 2006 about his vote in support of fencing at the southern U.S. border. ""Flashback: Joe Biden Boasts About Voting For '700 Miles Of Fence.’ This grainy footage from 2006 shows then-Sen. Joe Biden talking about immigration in some entirely different ways than he does today,"" reads the title and caption to the video, which has been shared more than a thousand times. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post appeared on American Voices Facebook page, which has nearly 3 million followers. The account says that it is affiliated with the Daily Caller, a conservative-leaning news website. Daily Caller’s watermark shows in the upper-right corner of the video. For this fact-check, PolitiFact reviewed the video as well as Biden’s past positions and statements on border security and his modern-day policy stances on immigration and border control. We found that he did support 2006 legislation funding a 700-mile fence at the southern U.S. border, but his statements at the time do not signify a significant departure from his current support for border security and other measures to control immigration into the U.S. Let’s look.     The three-minute video posted on Facebook starts with about a one-minute clip of fuzzy footage in which then-Sen. Biden is seen speaking to a group of people seated at tables. This clip comes from a Nov. 27, 2006, talk Biden gave to the Columbia (S.C.) Rotary Club. It was recorded by Brad Warthen, who was then editorial page editor for The State newspaper in Columbia. In it, Biden says: ""I voted for 700 miles of fence. But let me tell you, we can build a fence 40 stories high. Unless we change the dynamic in Mexico and — and you will not like this — and punish employers who knowingly violate the law when they hire illegals, unless you do those two things, all the rest is window dressing... ""And the reason why I,parenthetically, why I believe the fence is needed does not have anything to do with immigration, as much as drugs. I’m the guy that wrote the national crime bill. I’m the guy that wrote the national drug trafficking. I’m the guy that wrote the law that set up a drug czar. And let me tell you something folks, people are driving across that border with tons, tons — hear me — tons of everything from byproducts for methamphetamine to cocaine to heroin.""  The video then splices together more recent footage from Biden’s statements on immigration and border protection during the 2020 campaign, including a pledge to create a pathway to citizenship for people living in the United States without a legal status. The vote Biden references was for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was squarely aimed at reducing illegal immigration along the southern border. It was passed by a Republican-led Congress and signed by Republican President George W. Bush. The bill passed the Senate, 80-19, with Biden and then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton among 26 Democrats voting for it. The law authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the United States and Mexico.  The act also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to curb illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. Bush described it as part of his efforts toward comprehensive immigration reform. The Boston Globe in 2017 noted that Democrats who were normally in favor of looser immigration laws viewed the Secure Fence Act of 2006 as the lesser of two evils. Around that same time, the House passed legislation that would make any immigrant illegally in the country a felon. Biden said in the clip that his vote was mainly targeted at drug trafficking. But he also indicated that he doesn’t believe border security depends on the wall. He said he supported a variety of measures much as he does today, such as addressing root causes for why people seek to leave their homes for the United States. Biden campaigned for the presidency saying he would not take down border barriers or add more. He wants to use technology to maintain border security and to invest $4 billion to tackle the factors motivating Central Americans to migrate to the United States. A Facebook post says that a video shows Biden boasted in 2006 ""about voting for ‘700 miles of fence’"" and ""talking about immigration in some entirely different ways than he does today."" In the 2006 video clip, Biden did talk about voting for a 700-mile fence. He said he made the vote mainly to fight drug trafficking, not illegal immigration, but the 2006 Secure Fence Act was squarely aimed at stemming illegal immigration along the southern border. Biden in 2006 supported a variety of measures to fight illegal immigration much as he does today, including addressing root causes that lead people to flee their homes south of the U.S.-Mexico border for the United States. In that respect, Biden’s position is not so different.

Sen. Rodney Ellis says Harris County has some of highest incarceration rates in the world
","Editor’s note, July 8, 2016: We originally published this fact check on June 13 and rated the statement False. After that, experts pointed out we left out a step in our calculation of Harris County’s incarceration rate. We have updated our story and the rating has changed. You may read an archived version of the original article here. Equal Justice Under Law, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group, filed a lawsuit against Harris County’s bail system alleging that hundreds of offenders are jailed for minor offenses every day because they cannot afford to make bail. The group says that since 2015, it has filed 10 class action challenges to money bail systems in eight states. The May 2016 suit led state Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, to issue a press release on May 19, 2016, sharing his support of the legal action, saying, ""Harris County’s overreliance on the inefficient and ineffective use of mass incarceration as a means of dealing with low-level and nonviolent offenses continues to result in some of the highest jailing and incarceration rates in the U.S. and the world."" We’re familiar with incarceration rates. In August 2015, PolitiFact Virginia found Mostly True a claim the U.S. has the world’s highest incarceration rate -- meaning the greatest share of the population behind bars. In March 2016, we rated Mostly True a claim that Texas has a higher incarceration rate than Russia or Iran. So, does Harris County, the third most populous in the nation, also have one of the highest incarceration rates in the country and world? The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics defines an incarceration rate as the number of inmates per 100,000 residents held in state or federal prisons or local jails. To our request for the senator’s factual backup, Ellis aide David Edmonson emailed a spreadsheet listing incarceration rates for the five most populous counties in the state, based on data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Harris County had a rate of 234 inmates per 100,000, while the four less-populous counties had rates between 152 and 233 people per 100,000. Edmonson also included a link to a Washington Post fact-check stating the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, and a link to the website of The Sentencing Project listing Texas as having the seventh highest incarceration rate in the country. Harris County, he said, has the highest prison and state jail rate of the five largest counties in the state, as determined by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ""In other words,"" Edmonson wrote, ""Harris County sends the most people to prison and state jail -- in the state with the seventh-highest incarceration -- in the country with the highest incarceration rate."" Checking with TDCJ With Edmonson’s reply in our pocket, we looked to verify figures on our own. First, we checked with TDCJ to see how Harris County’s incarceration rate compares nationally and with other counties in Texas, focusing on the agency’s 2014 annual statistical report tallying newly incarcerated people (receives) and each facility’s on-hand population, which provides a closer look at the incarcerated population on Aug. 31, 2014, all by county of conviction. The data reflect populations in state prisons, state jails and substance abuse felony punishment facilities. By phone, we asked Jason Clark, the director of TDCJ, what the different charts represented in the agency’s report, and which would be most accurate for reflecting each county’s incarcerated population in state facilities. Clark described the on-hand population as the best overall measure, as ""new receives,"" only show the newly admitted population. He added one caveat — the counties listed show where a person was convicted, not necessarily where that person lived before or where that person is being detained. So, according to TDCJ, Harris County’s incarceration rate in state facilities in 2014, the most recent year published, was 599 inmates per 100,000 residents, or 26,647 inmates. By rate alone, that ranked Harris County 134th out of Texas’ 254 counties. However, there are many other prisoners held in local jailhouses. So we turned to the Texas Commission on Jail Standards, which regulates county jails and municipal lockups. The commission’s monthly incarceration rate report reflects the average daily population of county jail inmates, based on a 12-month average of one-day snapshots, taken the first day of each month.  According to the commission’s September 2014 report, Harris County in 2014 had a rate of 196.6 inmates per 100,000 residents, or 8,731 inmates in county and municipal lockups. Looking strictly at incarceration rates, regardless of the relative population of different counties, Harris County placed 169th in the state. By adding figures from both sources of data, we get a fuller picture of the number of people behind bars in Harris County, regardless of whether they are in a county jail or state prison.

That gives Harris County a 2014 incarceration rate of 796 inmates per 100,000 residents, or 35,378 people who were in county jail, state jail, prison or substance abuse facilities. If we include federal prison inmates, the overall rate increases to 816 per 100,000 residents, or 36,234 people. U.S., world incarceration rates For the same year, the total United States’ incarceration rate was 716 per 100,000, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit that advocates against what it calls mass criminalization policies. Worldwide, the Institute for Criminal Policy Research, a London-based nonprofit that conducts research on crime and criminal justice issues, calculated an incarceration rate of 144 per 100,000, based on United Nations data. That is, Harris County had a total incarceration rate exceeding both the world and U.S. rates. There are some Texas-centric wrinkles, however. Out of the five most populous Texas counties, Harris County’s rate came in second place for 2014. Dallas County had an overall incarceration rate of 913 inmates per 100,000, or 23,006 inmates. And far less populous counties had even higher rates. Notably, Kenedy County in South Texas ranked first in the state with an overall rate of 5,000 people per 100,000 residents, though the county accounted for a grand total of 20 inmates. At the time, Kenedy County was home to 400 residents; Harris County’s population was 4.4 million.  Experts comment For guidance, we checked with two independent criminal justice experts. Peter Wagner directs the Prison Policy Initiative, which studies incarceration rates closely and often is called upon to explain such figures. Michele Dietch, a senior lecturer in the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, has worked on criminal justice issues since the late 1980s. Wagner said the initiative’s global report, which folds in U.S. states with other countries to make state-to-country incarceration rate comparisons, leaves out countries with populations of less than 500,000. Smaller countries could prove distracting in discussing how the United States differs from its peers, he said. According to the report, Texas had a 2014 incarceration rate of 1,063 per 100,000, which was the fifth highest in the world. Louisiana ranked No. 1 internationally; its rate was 1,341 inmates per 100,000 residents. Louisiana’s population of 4.6 million, according to 2015 Census figures, is comparable to Harris County’s population of 4.5 million for the same time period. The report includes federal prison populations in state incarceration rate calculations, since ""state politics certainly influence whether and where federal prisons are built."" Mississippi, Oklahoma and Georgia also topped Texas, with rates ranging from 1,074 to 1,155 inmates per 100,000 residents. Among countries, the U.S. had the highest rate, 716 prisoners per 100,000 residents. Since we began our research, the PPI came out with a new 2016 global incarceration rate report. While rates have changed (Texas went from a rate of 1,063 inmates per 100,000 to 890), rankings have more or less remained the same. Texas ranks eighth in the world, Louisiana is now second after Washington, D.C. and the United States is still the first country to appear on the list with a rate of 693 per 100,000. Dietch told us by phone that she sees value in both per capita rates and raw counts. Per capita rates, she said, are the best way to make comparisons because they adjust for what can be vast differences in population. ""Per capita rates equalize comparisons across jurisdictions of different sizes,"" she wrote in a follow-up email. ""Otherwise, big jurisdictions will always look worse in terms of absolute numbers.""   But, she said, there’s value in looking at absolute numbers, since jurisdictions contributing the largest numbers of inmates will have ""by far the biggest impact on the system."" That is, rural Kenedy County may have the state’s highest incarceration rate and may be sending a higher share of its residents into the criminal justice system, Dietch said, yet its share of all state prisoners remains negligible. ""Those absolute numbers — not the rates — are one of the key drivers of the size of the incarcerated population,"" she said via email. ""And none of this even begins to take into account issues such as the length of sentences, another key driver of incarceration trends in Texas."" ""You need to look at both to understand,"" she said.   She explained one of the main reasons a smaller county may have a higher incarceration rate lies in the lack of local sentencing alternatives including support programs, substance abuse treatment or electronic monitoring. People end up in prison or jail, Dietch said, because there isn’t much else as an alternative. In contrast, she said, urban communities like Harris County have more options to keep people out of jail and prison, she said. Our ruling Ellis said Harris County has some of the highest jailing and incarceration rates in the U.S. and the world. Harris County's rate -- calculated as the number of inmates per 100,000 residents -- exceeds the rates for the United States and world though we found jurisdictions including Dallas County with higher rates.

The scourge of heroin and opioid deaths still doesn’t match AIDS at its worst
","Before signing legislation to combat New York State’s growing heroin and opiate addiction problem, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo compared the epidemic’s death toll to the number of people who died during the peak of the AIDS crisis. Cuomo, who created a heroin and opioids task force this year, said the number of people dying from a heroin or opiate overdose today is comparable to the number of people who died from AIDS at its worst. ""Over the past 10 years we’ve lost 10,000 people to heroin overdoses and the numbers are increasing exponentially. It is spiking. It is becoming more and more available, especially among the younger community, it’s becoming more and more accepted, and it is truly, truly a frightening and staggering increase. We’re losing as many people to heroin and opioid overdoses as we lost to the AIDS epidemic at its peak. That’s how bad this is. Think about that: The AIDS epidemic – one of the worst things that society has had to deal with, and the loss of life is just about the same with this heroin epidemic. So the numbers are staggering, and it’s frightening, and it’s getting worse,"" Cuomo said, referring to the country’s growing problem with heroin and opiates. Cuomo’s office said the governor was referring to New York State residents when citing the loss of 10,000 lives over the past 10 years. In comparing recent heroin and opioid deaths to the AIDS death toll, Cuomo’s office said he was referring to national figures. So did the number of deaths from heroin and opioid overdoses actually match AIDS at its peak? Prescription Drug Overdoses vs. Heroin and Opioid Overdoses The number of people in the U.S. who died from a drug overdose in 2014 was 47,055, which rivals the worst year of the AIDS epidemic. But only about 60 percent - 28,647 - were from heroin and opioid overdoses, according to 2014 data from the Centers for Disease Control. The federal agency hasn’t finished compiling 2015 numbers yet, and no other government entity has released anything more recent.

 Deaths From AIDS That doesn’t come close to the deaths from AIDS at the peak of the AIDS epidemic in 1995. The CDC’s mortality database, confirmed by a CDC representative, shows 43,115 deaths directly caused by AIDS that year. That’s different from the number of people who died with AIDS, which counts people who died following an AIDS diagnosis regardless of whether their deaths were related to the disease or not. What about overdoses after 2014? From 2014 to now, have the number of people who died from a heroin or opiate overdose increased to match the number of deaths from AIDS in 1995? To reach that level, data would have to show an increase of about 50 percent in the number of deaths from heroin and opioid overdoses between then and now. When contacted, the CDC would not speculate on whether such an increase was likely. In Erie County, deaths from heroin or opioid overdoses more than doubled between 2014 and 2015, according to the Erie County Health Department. Dr. Gale Burstein, the Erie County health commissioner, attributed the spike partly to what’s now being dealt on the streets. Dealers now often mix fentanyl, a painkiller, with heroin to increase potency. Cuomo’s office confirmed he was referring to the latest national data in his claim. In a phone conversation, a representative from the CDC said the agency has not finished compiling data for 2015. We base our ruling on the 2014 heroin and opioid overdose numbers. Our Ruling Cuomo, in a press conference in Buffalo, said, ""We’re losing as many people to heroin and opioid overdoses as we lost to the AIDS epidemic at its peak."" About 28,000 people died from a heroin or opioid overdose in 2014. About 43,000 people died from AIDS in 1995. Cuomo’s comparison is a reach. If he had been referring to the total number of drug overdoses, his claim would have been fine. There are more people dying from drug overdoses overall than the number who died from AIDS at the peak of the AIDS crisis. But the number of deaths from heroin and opioids alone continues to rise, more than doubling in Erie County alone between 2014 and 2015. We rate this claim as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/jul/08/andrew-cuomo/fewer-people-are-dying-heroin-and-opioid-overdoses/

Sen. Sherrod Brown says Trump 'never' denounced NAFTA when it was debated in Congress
","Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, seemed taken aback when ABC This Week host Martha Raddatz juxtaposed the harsh views of U.S. trade deals of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump with Brown’s own critiques over the years. Brown has said that he’d like to renegotiate a better North American Free Trade Agreement, as has Trump. Both men have also expressed concerns that China could enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal ""through the back door"" (a Trump statement we rated Pants on Fire). ""Well done,"" Brown said after Raddatz played clips of his statements. ""Good research.""  ""A couple of things -- first of all,"" Brown went on, ""all I’ve heard with Donald Trump, the guy who made a lot of money from outsourcing jobs to China, to Mexico, to Turkey, to Slovenia, to other countries I’m forgetting right now -- the guy that made a lot of money from that is now against this trade policy, but never, ever raised his voice against it when Congress was considering it."" Brown, in office since 2007, has been determinedly critical of U.S. trade policies like NAFTA throughout his career, even authoring the book Myths of Free Trade: Why American Trade Policy Has Failed. Meanwhile, it’s well documented that Trump often says a thing, then denies having said it.  So we turned to the public record of Trump on trade. Trump’s trade take-aways In July 2015, defending his ""made in China"" ties, Trump told CNN straight-up: ""It’s very, very hard to have anything in apparel made in this country."" Some, but not all, of Trump’s products are made in China, as we’ve previously confirmed. Others are made in Bangladesh and Mexico.   The Washington Post reported that in 2004, Trump signed on with Phillips-Van Heusen to put his name on a collection of shirts, eyewear, cuff links and suits. He hired a company to broker the deal. Trump could have insisted on American manufacturing as part of those negotiations, but he didn’t, the Post reported. In the first three years of the licensing deal with Phillips-Van Heusen, Trump made over $3.2 million in royalties. In 2003, 95 percent of Phillips-Van Heusen’s products were manufactured in foreign countries, many of which had free trade agreements with the United States. The benefits of those agreements are spelled out in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission annual filings. ""These products are imported and are subject to U.S. customs laws, which impose tariffs as well as import quota restrictions for textiles and apparel established by the U.S. government,"" read one such filing from 2004. ""In addition, a portion of our imported products is eligible for certain duty-advantaged programs commonly known as NAFTA, AGOA, CBTPA and CBI."" To put the cost advantages in plain speech, we turned to Dean Baker at the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""With a deal like NAFTA, the large purpose of the agreement was to encourage investment in Mexico, so companies set up operations in Mexico at lower cost than if they were producing them domestically,"" Baker said. ""Other agreements, like granting China permanent normal trade relations status, facilitated the same sort of thing with China. The direct effect is getting lower-cost labor."" The indirect effect, Baker said, is that domestic workers are pinched even if they keep their jobs. Their bargaining power for better pay or other benefits is decreased under the threat of the company packing up and moving overseas. ""There are many instances where companies force concessions from workers, so that if they don’t agree to lower pay, the company will shift production, and they’ll lose their jobs,"" Baker said.   In a 2005 blog posted on his Trump University website, now defunct but archived online, Trump defended outsourcing: ""I know that doesn't make it any easier for people whose jobs have been outsourced overseas, but if a company's only means of survival is by farming jobs outside its walls, then sometimes it's a necessary step. The other option might be to close its doors for good."" In other words, Brown’s account of Trump outsourcing production of his ventures checks out. But what about his lack of a record opposing those deals? ‘Never, ever raised his voice’?  Debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement had reached its zenith in October 1993. The policy passed the Senate the following month, was signed by President Bill Clinton in December, and went into effect Jan. 1, 1994. Trump wasn’t a politician in the early 1990s. At the time, the New York real estate mogul’s name was synonymous with wealth, just a few years after he published 1987’s The Art of the Deal. In that autobiography, Trump catalogued all the ways that he’d expanded his influence beyond the $40 million he inherited from his dad. Trump already had the type of fame that draws cameras for walking out to get the mail, so if the businessman were to weigh in on NAFTA, he’d be quoted. And so he was. Buzzfeed’s Andrew Kaczynski unearthed reports of an October 1993 business conference in Bakersfield, Calif., at which Trump was a speaker. (Other speakers included Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush, comedian Phyllis Diller, weatherman Willard Scott, and businessmen T. Boone Pickens and Lee Iacocca.) Nobody taped Trump’s speech, according to conference representatives contacted by Buzzfeed. But Kaczynski found, and PolitiFact Ohio reviewed, local newspaper reports like one from the Daily News of Los Angeles, which called Trump ""one of the few to come out against NAFTA."" The Lodi News-Sentinel reported, ""Trump apparently ardently spoke against the plan,"" because, ""it would only benefit Mexico."" Trump said, ""The Mexicans want it, and that doesn’t sound good to me,"" according to the Long Beach Press-Telegram. That same month, Trump did make his way to Capitol Hill, but not to talk trade deals. He testified before the House Natural Resources Committee, advocating tighter regulation over Native American-owned casinos on tribal lands. Such casinos were stiff competition for his own casino properties in Atlantic City, N.J. Trump complained that prospective casino owners on reservations ""don’t look like Indians to me, and they don’t look like Indians to Indians."" (The paper reported that Trump had been ""on a tear on this subject for months."") Brown spokeswoman Jennifer Donohue told PolitiFact that Brown was trying to draw a contrast between his efforts to discourage outsourcing, and Trump’s capitalization of it. ""The point he was making on Sunday is that he’s never known Donald Trump to be an active ally in that fight,"" Donohue said. Our ruling Brown said Trump made a lot of money from outsourcing jobs thanks to NAFTA ""but never, ever raised his voice against it when Congress was considering it."" Yes, Trump has benefitted financially from trade deals like NAFTA. Even he acknowledges that. But Brown’s televised comment makes it sound as though Trump changed his mind on trade when it became politically expedient. Rather, Trump was not a fan of NAFTA from the start, and was a rare voice in opposition to it at a Bakersfield, Calif., convention.   We rate Brown’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/jul/08/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-trump-never-denounced-nafta/

Kenney blasts Pat Toomey’s ‘fearmongering’ around sanctuary city policy, but here’s the thing
","Sen. Pat Toomey lost a major battle on the Senate floor this week when Democrats blocked his attempts to advance a bill that would have stripped millions of dollars in funding from so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" including Philadelphia. In a statement before the vote, Toomey, who’s in a bitter fight for re-election this year, said ""Sanctuary cities such as Philadelphia refuse to cooperate with the federal government in locating suspected terrorists who are in their custody and are in the country illegally."" Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney disagreed. The Democrat in his first year as mayor released a statement this week excoriating Toomey, a Republican, saying the senator’s ""inaccurate"" statements ""are nothing more than fearmongering"" and were ""pulled straight from Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant playbook."" He said the city does cooperate with federal investigators in cases related to suspected terrorism. So who’s right? We decided to check the claim. Philadelphia’s immigration policy and terrorism When Kenney entered office earlier this year, one of his first moves as mayor was to reinstate Philadelphia’s status as a ""sanctuary city."" In this case, that means the city will not comply with Department of Homeland Security requests for Immigration and Customs Enforcement holds, a tactic used by federal officials to detain undocumented immigrants who otherwise would have been released from police custody. Dozens of jurisdictions across the nation have ""sanctuary"" policies. Proponents argue DHS uses ICE holds to arbitrarily detain undocumented immigrants accused of petty crimes. Philadelphia’s executive order stipulates that a detainer request will not be followed, nor will notification of a person’s pending release go out to DHS, unless the person is being released ""after conviction for a first or second degree felony involving violence and the detainer is supported by a judicial warrant."" Toomey’s office points to this as the problem. There’s nothing in Kenney’s executive order that explicitly allows officials in Philadelphia to communicate the pending release of a suspected terrorist who was not convicted of a violent crime with federal investigators. Toomey’s spokeswoman E.R. Anderson pointed out the ""vast majority of suspected terrorists would not fit into Mayor Kenney’s narrow category."" ""Philadelphia police are forbidden to share information or otherwise cooperate to apprehend those terror suspects who have not yet been convicted of a violent first or second degree felony — a category that encompasses Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokar Tsaernev [sic], the San Bernardino shooters, and the Orlando shooter,"" she wrote in a prepared statement. However, if any of those attacks had taken place in Philadelphia, police would have communicated with federal investigators because none of those examples are undocumented immigrants. Tsarnaev’s citizenship was approved. One San Bernardino shooter was in America on a visa, the other was born in Chicago. The Orlando shooter was born in New York. Toomey’s office said it used these only as examples to illustrate that most terrorists had not been convicted of violent crimes prior to committing an act of terrorism. And they’re right. Nine out of 10 individuals on the terror watch list who tried to buy a gun last year were approved and passed a background check that would have flagged them had they been convicted of a felony. But when asked if the city would cooperate with a DHS detainer request in the case of a suspected terrorist who was an undocumented immigrant convicted of a minor offense, Kenney’s spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said: ""The City of Philadelphia does cooperate with the federal government in the case of suspected terrorism."" She said the city complies with federal criminal complaints ""so that someone who is accused of a crime, like terrorism, would be detained pursuant to the complaint."" Cooperating with the feds Kenney’s sanctuary city law was put into effect largely to curb federal overreach and to protect undocumented immigrants from being deported after being accused of a minor offense. Paula Meninato, the civic engagement coordinator for the Philadelphia-based Pennsylvania Immigration and Citizenship Coalition, said Toomey’s concerns about suspected terrorists going free in Philadelphia and other sanctuary cities are misplaced. ""Most of the people that are targeted by these policies… are people that either got arrested for petty crimes or people that haven’t done anything at all,"" she said, ""that get targeted by police who are just regular people trying to make a living."" However, Philadelphia says it does cooperate with DHS related to those convicted of violent crimes. Of the thousands of undocumented immigrants deported last year, DHS reported that more than 1,000 were suspected gang members. But it didn’t report that any were suspected terrorists. A DHS official told PolitiFact that the city’s existing executive order ""does not appear"" to allow the city to honor ICE detainers or requests for notification of pending release with respect to any individuals in the custody of the City of Philadelphia. ""With the implementation of the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) more than a year ago, many law enforcement agencies that had previous(ly) declined to cooperate with ICE, including some large jurisdictions, are now once again working with the agency,"" ICE spokesman Khaalid Walls said in a prepared statement. To support Toomey’s claim that sanctuary cities don’t cooperate with federal investigators in cases of suspected terrorism, his office pointed to Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, who traveled to Philadelphia this year to urge Kenney to comply with the department’s Priority Enforcement Program which prioritizes the deportation of violent criminals. After his meeting with Kenney, Johnson told The Philadelphia Inquirer: ""The mayor and I had a good dialogue,"" though Kenney wouldn’t budge on his policy. In testimony before a senate committee last week, Johnson specifically called out Philadelphia for not complying. ""I will note that I have had conversations with city officials in Philadelphia and in Cook County, Illinois without success so far,"" he said. ""And I have urged a number of cities and counties that it’s for the benefit of public safety that dangerous criminals not be released."" Kenney’s also been urged by both Toomey and his Democratic opponent for Senate Katie McGinty, both of whom said Kenney should reconsider the city’s level of cooperation with federal investigators looking to gain information about undocumented immigrants in the city’s custody. Toomey’s bill, which was defeated in a procedural vote on Wednesday, would strip Community Development Block Grants from sanctuary cities like Philadelphia who refuse to comply with certain DHS detainer requests. This year, Philadelphia received $40 million from such grants, leading local officials and PA Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat, to oppose Toomey’s legislation. The incumbent Republican Senator has made sanctuary cities a critical issue in his campaign against McGinty. She hasn’t come out in full support of Kenney’s policy, but she also hasn’t outright rejected it. Our Ruling In order to support his sanctuary city legislation, Toomey said ""Sanctuary cities such as Philadelphia refuse to cooperate with the federal government in locating suspected terrorists who are in their custody and are in the country illegally."" Philadelphia officials unequivocally deny that, saying they have and will work with federal investigators in cases of suspected terrorism. They reject Toomey’s statements that imply officials in the city don’t work with the feds in cases of terrorism, as Kenney’s sanctuary city policy applies only in cases involving undocumented immigrants not convicted of violent crimes. Last year, DHS didn’t report bringing any suspected terrorists into custody solely based on his or her immigration status. But there isn’t anything in Philadelphia’s existing executive order carving out an exception for suspected terrorists who haven’t been charged with a violent crime, and the Obama administration has urged the city to reconsider that stance. It’s the city’s word vs. language in the order. We rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/jul/08/pat-toomey/kenney-blasts-pat-toomeys-fearmongering-around-san/

Meme resurrects bogus claim from 2014 about Loretta Lynch helping Bill Clinton in Whitewater probe
","Want to know why Attorney General Loretta Lynch isn't indicting Hillary Clinton for her email practices? An unsigned viral image posted on Twitter by a self-proclaimed ""news organization"" suggests an explanation. It shows pictures of Lynch and former President Bill Clinton, who had a controversial meeting with Lynch as his wife was under investigation by the FBI, with the words, ""Fun fact of the day. Lynch was a member of Bill Clinton's defense team during the 1992 Whitewater corruption probe."" That factoid was debunked years ago. PolitiFact, for one, gave it a Pants on Fire in 2014 — when she was nominated — after the conservative website Breitbart posted it and, eventually, took it down. (Others like Patriot Update and the Christian website WND, have kept the uncorrected story on their sites.) The reason the post is wrong? It's the wrong Loretta Lynch. First, a little background is in order. Whitewater is the name of a failed Arkansas land deal in which Bill and Hillary Clinton were investors. When the deal was inaugurated, he was Arkansas attorney general. The developer behind the project, James McDougal, owned a savings and loan called Madison Guaranty that was also involved in the project. Complicating the affair is the fact that McDougal later hired Rose Law Firm to do some of its legal work, and one of the firm's partners was Hillary Clinton, who had, by then, become Arkansas' first lady. When billing records for the project became lost, and it turned out that Hillary Clinton was signing off on those records, things looked even more suspicious. The records were eventually recovered, and no charges were ever brought against the Clintons despite numerous investigations. The land deal was a bust — the Clintons sold their share in the project to McDougal for $1,000 in 1992, three years after Madison Guaranty failed. The Loretta Lynch who helped Bill Clinton in the Whitewater case is a white woman who got a law degree from Yale and worked on several political campaigns, including Clinton’s. She served as president of the California Public Utilities Commission from 2000-02 and as a commissioner until 2005. Loretta Lynch, the current U.S. attorney general, is a black woman and Harvard Law School graduate who began working as a federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York in 1990, so she couldn’t have been part of Clinton’s defense a few years later. She was appointed by President Barack Obama on May 3, 2010, as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, an office she previously led from 1999 to 2001. From 2002 to 2010 she was in private practice. She took over the Justice Department in April 2015. The Twitter post, which begins with the message ""Why does this matter? Cause it freaking does!"" remained posted even after a few commenters pointed out that the Lynches are two different women. The allegation was ridiculous at the time. It's even more ridiculous now because a quick Google search would have revealed that it's wrong. Pants on Fire! (Here's a PolitiFact-approved version of the meme.

Do more people die in Wisconsin from overdoses than car crashes?
","More than a month after Prince died at the age of 57, toxicology tests determined the visionary musician’s cause of death: fentanyl, a synthetic opiate up to 50 times more potent than heroin. On June 6, 2016, Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel penned a guest column in the Wisconsin State Journal connecting Prince’s overdose to the state’s opiate epidemic. He sought to end to the stigma around drug addiction — and urged people to lock up prescription painkillers in their homes. Painkillers are often the starting point for people who develop opiate addictions. ""We must alter our view of opiates,"" Schimel wrote. ""More people now die in Wisconsin from drug overdoses than car crashes."" Is Schimel right that drug overdoses have not always outnumbered car accident fatalities in Wisconsin but do now? If accurate, it would strengthen his case that drug addiction has become an increasingly urgent issue. We decided to look at the numbers. Checking the figures In support of Schimel’s statement, state Department of Justice spokesman Johnny Koremenos provided a report issued in September 2015 by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. ""Deaths from drug poisoning, also called ‘overdose,’ have doubled since 2004 and surpassed motor vehicle traffic deaths in 2008,"" the report said. The sentence doesn’t refer to the total number of deaths, but to age-adjusted death rates. That approach is used to better make comparisons across years, when the age structure of a population changes. An accompanying age-adjusted chart showed that 4 out of every 100,000 people died from a drug overdose in 1999 while 16 out of 100,000 did by 2013. The death rate from car crashes moderately declined during the same period, from around 13 out of 100,000 people to 9. Beginning in 2008, the death rate from drug overdoses surpassed the death rate from car crashes in the chart. We asked the Department of Health Services what the unadjusted numbers show. According to Jennifer Miller, spokeswoman for the Department of Health Services, 2009 was the first time that deaths from drug overdoses outnumbered deaths from car crashes in Wisconsin. And overdose deaths have outnumbered car crash deaths every year since. In 2014, the most recent year available, 843 people in Wisconsin died of drug overdoses while 558 died in car crashes. So both age-adjusted and raw numbers show that beginning in 2008 or 2009 (depending on which numbers you use) more people in Wisconsin died from drug use than from car crashes. Nationally, the total number of drug-related deaths surpassed the number of motor vehicle deaths in 2008 -- about the same time the numbers flipped in Wisconsin. Our rating Schimel said more people now die in Wisconsin from drug overdoses than car crashes. The most recent data available from 2014 supports his statement -- 2009 was the first year when more people died from drug overdoses than in car crashes.

Carlos Beruff wrongly attacks Marco Rubio's record on border security and immigration bill
","Marco Rubio’s Republican rival for the Senate says that Rubio sided with President Barack Obama on amnesty, rather than protecting the border from undocumented immigrants as Donald Trump vows to do. Bradenton businessman Carlos Beruff sent a statement to the media July 5 blasting Rubio on immigration: ""When faced with increasing threats to Americans, what did Marco Rubio do? Rather than work to secure the border, he supported Obama’s amnesty plan for illegal immigrants, endearing him to the Washington establishment in his bid for president. It’s clear that ISIS and others intent on doing us harm will use any means necessary, including our Southern border, to enter this country."" Beruff then praised Trump’s immigration plan. Beruff’s campaign argues that Rubio supported a plan that would have immediately legalized immigrants without guarantees of border security. That’s distorting the facts. The legislation Rubio helped draft had multiple hurdles to permanent legal status and had extensive border security measures -- and funding for them. The Rubio campaign declined to comment. Border security and the 2013 immigration bill Beruff spokesman Chris Hartline said he was referring to the 2013 immigration bill that Rubio co-authored along with a group of senators dubbed the ""Gang of Eight."" The bill passed the Senate, but House leadership refused to allow it to reach a vote, so it died. Obama supported it. Border security was a significant part of the bill. It called for billions for border enforcement for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. Rubio played an active role in negotiating an amendment that included the beefed up security measures. The federal government had to start implementing border security plans -- but didn’t have to finish it -- before it could process applications for what the bill called ""registered provisional immigrant status"" or RPI. That wasn’t the same as lawful permanent resident status, but it would allow as proponents said, for undocumented immigrants to ""come out of the shadows"" and legally work here for years. The legislation wasn’t strictly amnesty, either. It set out a 13-year path with significant hurdles such as fines, background checks and waiting periods. That would have granted a certain level of legal status to ""millions of illegal immigrants on day one,"" Hartline said. But those on RPI status couldn’t move to lawful permanent status until six months after the Homeland Security Secretary certified to the president and Congress that it had achieved multiple triggers in the border security plan. Those triggers included additional border patrol agents, 350 miles of extra fencing, an entry/exit tracking system and required employers to use an employment verification system. ""The Senate legislation had quite significant teeth in it, requiring demonstrable progress on border enforcement before the two-stage legalization process could take place, with most unauthorized immigrants needing to wait at least 10 years before they could apply for a green card,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute. But Beruff’s campaign argues that the bill didn’t prioritize border security and points to a statement by Rubio that legalization would come before border security: ""First comes legalization, then comes this border security measure and then comes the permanent residency process,"" Rubio said in a June 9, 2013, interview with Univision. ""What we are talking about here is the permanent residency system. Regarding legalization, a vast majority of my colleagues have already accepted that: that it must take place and that it must start at the same time we start with what has to do with security."" The border security provisions were contingent on the Obama administration following through, Hartline said. And Rubio himself later said while running for president that ""the American people do not trust the federal government to enforce our immigration laws."" However, the bill set aside a $46.3 billion designated pot of money -- the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Trust Fund -- for border security. The Beruff campaign also notes that after the bill died, Rubio changed his strategy and called for a piecemeal approach of multiple bills with border security first. That’s true, but it doesn’t mean that the original bill lacked border security measures. Experts disagreed on whether Rubio’s shift in tactics was a substantial change or not; however, experts we interviewed about Beruff’s statement said that the 2013 bill clearly had border security in it. Kevin Johnson, dean of the law school at University of California at Davis, said it’s wrong to suggest that the 2013 bill lacked border security. ""Rubio supported a compromise bill that did provide for more enforcement and a path to legalization for some undocumented immigrants,"" he said. Since Rubio voted in favor of border security enhancements, ""it is incorrect to assert that Senator Rubio failed to secure the border,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School. Our ruling Beruff said, ""Rather than work to secure the border, (Rubio) supported Obama’s amnesty plan for illegal immigrants."" Beruff is flat-out wrong about Rubio’s efforts to secure the border and misleads when he calls the 2013 bill ""amnesty."" Rubio co-authored the 2013 bill (which was the work of the Senate, not from the White House) that included extensive border security measures such as more border patrol agents and fencing. It’s an exaggeration to call that bill amnesty because while it included a path to citizenship, undocumented immigrants had to pass multiple hurdles.

Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch says Wisconsin's per-inmate cost 'cheap' compared to country
","How much it costs to detain an inmate in each state prison system for a year sounds like a relatively easy question to answer. It isn’t. Appearing on the Jerry Bader Show in April, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch responded to criticism Bader said he had received from listeners after he read on the air an opinion piece that ran in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The piece discussed machining classes offered to inmates. Bader told Kleefisch that he had received a number of emails from listeners who felt that her opinion piece on former inmates’ reentry to society gave deference to people who got into trouble rather than people who stayed out of prison. Kleefisch responded that the vast majority of people who go to prison will return to their communities. ""Right now, our corrections department charges taxpayers between $30,000 and $40,000 a year per person we lock up,"" she said. ""That’s actually cheap when you compare us to the rest of the country."" She followed that statement by asking rhetorically whether it’s better for taxpayers to return people to the community ""ready to succeed and become a taxpayer themselves"" or let them depend on government programs or commit another crime and go back to prison at a cost to taxpayers. We wondered if she was right on the numbers and how Wisconsin compares to other states. Kleefisch’s statement can be divided into two parts: That the Wisconsin DOC charges taxpayers between $30,000 and $40,000 per year per inmate. That Wisconsin is ""cheap"" compared to the rest of the country. On Wisconsin’s cost per inmate per year We asked Kleefisch’s office for evidence of this claim. First, they cited a fact sheet from the Wisconsin Department of Corrections that lists the cost for adult male inmates at $32,394.71 and the cost for adult female inmates at $39,724.00 in the year from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015. The Department of Corrections told us they calculate this number by adding the direct facility costs, including staff salary and benefits; food; utilities; clothing; repair and maintenance costs; other infrastructure costs, and ""allocated central office costs."" On a basic level, the numbers from the DOC fall within the range Kleefisch cited. How Wisconsin compares Things get more complex when you try to compare prison costs between states. This is primarily because budgeting practices are not uniform and, as far as we found, there are few organizations that do an apples-to-apples comparison. Finally, the one study we were repeatedly directed to uses data from 2010. Kleefisch’s office and other sources we contacted pointed us to a 2012 study from the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit group that says it seeks to build and improve justice systems. The study looks at corrections department data from 40 states, including Wisconsin, that responded to the organization’s surveys. The Vera Institute included in its analysis the costs associated with corrections systems that fall outside the corrections budget in each state. Those additional costs can include underfunded contributions to retiree health care for corrections employees, state contributions to retiree health care on behalf of their corrections department workers, employee benefits and more. Including those, Vera researchers found that ""the total price to taxpayers was $39 billion, $5.4 billion more than the $33.5 billion reflected in corrections budgets alone."" Wisconsin had relatively few costs that fell outside the DOC budget in 2010 but that wasn’t true of all states. Kleefisch's office argued Wisconsin fares better than other states, since the department fully funds its employee retirement while other states do not. Vera says estimates of underfunded retiree pension and health care benefits are included in the total per-inmate costs. If you rank the states from highest average annual per-inmate cost to lowest using the Vera Institute’s numbers, Wisconsin comes in 14th from the top at $37,994. Wisconsin comes in higher than 26 of the 40 states in the study but lower than some of the top-spending states, including New York, which came in first at $60,076.   Kleefisch Chief of Staff Daniel Suhr noted in an email that his boss meant ""cheap compared to other states, not cheap compared to a particular mean or median"" and noted that Wisconsin comes in lower than New York, California and Illinois. Kleefisch’s statement, however, compared Wisconsin to ""the rest of the country."" That said, the study itself, one of its authors and others, cautioned against comparing the states. First, the fact that 10 states are not represented in the study is a ""big limitation,"" Chris Henrichson, research director for the Center on Sentencing and Corrections at the Vera Institute, said in an email. In addition, the information is a bit dated. Experts disagreed on whether it could accurately be applied to today. Henrichson said he expected ""rankings"" to shift somewhat, most likely in states where the inmate populations have changed the most. That said, he did not expect a state at the bottom of the chart to move to the top. Experts also questioned generally whether it is possible to account for all the differences between state corrections systems and their budgeting practices. Our rating Kleefisch said that the state Department of Corrections ""charges taxpayers between $30,000 and $40,000 a year per person we lock up. That's actually cheap, when you compare us to the rest of the country."" The annual per-inmate cost from DOC does fall within the range she cited. While Kleefisch labeled Wisconsin as cheap compared to other states, the best available numbers suggest the state, at best, is more in the middle of the pack than close to the bottom. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.",/factchecks/2016/jul/08/rebecca-kleefisch/Kleefisch-per-inmate-cost-comparison/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Terrorism', 'Donald Trump']","
Was Saddam Hussein good at killing terrorists, as Donald Trump says?
","To the surprise of some observers, Donald Trump has recently given a few campaign-trail shout-outs to Saddam Hussein -- a man the United States twice went to war with. Most recently -- though not for the first time -- Trump gave the late Iraqi dictator some credit at a campaign rally in Raleigh, N.C., on July 5, 2016. ""Saddam Hussein was a bad guy. Right?"" Trump said. ""He was a bad guy. Really bad guy. But you know what, he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good they didn't read (them) the rights. They didn't talk. ... Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism. You want to be a terrorist? You go to Iraq. It's like Harvard. OK? So sad."" This prompted bipartisan criticism, including from Hillary Clinton’s campaign. But Trump proceeded to double down on his statement. Trump largely repeated his message at a rally in Cincinnati on July 6, and said in an interview with the Cincinnati Enquirer the same day, ""That’s not praising Saddam Hussein. I would say maybe it’s the opposite. But when it comes to terrorism, I said he did a good job because he killed terrorists."" We wondered: Is it accurate for Trump to say that Saddam Hussein ""killed terrorists""? Experts told us that Trump has a point -- though one that’s undercut by missing context and questionable relevance. Trump’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry. Who’s a terrorist? Complicating any analysis of Trump’s assertion is the fact that, as we have previously noted, there is no single definition of terrorism. Hussein may have considered some of his domestic opponents terrorists, but not everyone else would agree. Indeed, Hussein could be a ruthless foe of those who threatened his monopoly on power, and many of these would be considered Islamists in opposition to Hussein's historically secular regime. Yet he was not averse to leveraging Islamic terrorists to advance his own ends beyond Iraq’s borders. ""Saddam rarely used the term ‘terrorists,’ "" said Joseph Sassoon, an associate professor at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and author of Saddam Hussein’s Baath Party: Inside an Authoritarian Regime. ""One side can see certain people as freedom fighters while others perceive them as terrorists. A case in point: Palestinian suicide bombers. Israel and the U.S. saw them as terrorists while Saddam' regime gave each suicide bomber's family a large gift of about $50,000."" So one weakness with Trump’s claim is that many of the ""terrorists"" Hussein killed weren’t necessarily killed for their ""terrorism,"" and many would not have been considered ""terrorists"" by anyone beyond Hussein's own circle. Where Trump has a point That said, perhaps the strongest argument for Trump’s assertion is to compare what went on during Hussein's regime and what has happened afterward. His often brutal clampdowns had the side effect of keeping all types of dissent, including terrorism, in check. Since his ouster, instability has often reigned, allowing violence, including terrorism, to flourish. In fact, ISIS -- perhaps today’s most feared terrorist group -- emerged in the chaos of post-war Iraq when it was known as al-Qaida in Iraq. Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, blamed both Bush and Clinton for supporting a war in Iraq that destroyed the country’s governing structures. ""They also cast out the Sunni elite and Iraqi military from the top of society down to the bottom of society, eliminating their pensions, jobs and futures. This misguided and destructive action infuriated a large swath of Iraqi society, many of whom joined al-Qaida and became ‘terrorists’ according to the U.S. definition. The U.S. has been trying to kill them ever since."" Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, agreed that while Trump’s phrasing was ""imprecise,"" the difference in the prevalence of terrorism before and after the Iraq War is ""no comparison."" ""The Iraq War has been devastating to U.S. interests and an enormous boon to jihadists,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. ""The Iraq War made us less safe."" Focusing on the relationship between Hussein and terrorism also offers a useful corrective to the incorrect theory that Hussein had some sort of connection to perpetrating the 9/11 terror attacks, experts said. CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen made this argument in a provocative column headlined, ""Trump gets it right on Saddam."" Bergen wrote that post-war analysis by the U.S. intelligence community has failed to turn up any significant links between Hussein and al-Qaida, the perpetrator of the 9/11 attacks. ""Saddam's government kept meticulous records,"" Bergen wrote. ""The Defense Intelligence Agency had by 2006 translated 34 million pages of documents from Saddam's Iraq and found there was nothing to substantiate a ‘partnership’ between Saddam and al-Qaida."" Subsequent analysis of 600,000 additional documents by the Pentagon-affiliated Institute for Defense Analyses similarly concluded that there was no smoking gun, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence also found no ""cooperative relationship,"" Bergen wrote. Where Trump’s argument falters On the other hand, Trump has ignored some crucial context in making a sweeping assertion about Hussein's rule. Here are some of the problems. • Hussein actively sponsored terrorism, as well. Indeed, Iraq was on the official U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism between 1979 and 1982, and then again between 1990 and 2004, when Hussein ruled the country. ""He did kill some terrorists, but he supported others, such as Abu Nidal and the MEK cultists from Iran,"" said John Limbert, a former high-ranking State Department official who now teaches international relations at the U.S. Naval Academy. In the conservative magazine the Weekly Standard, editor Stephen F. Hayes offered a lengthy recap of Hussein's terrorist connections in a piece titled, ""Trump Is Clueless on Saddam and Terror."" ""Saddam Hussein opposed terrorists who opposed him,"" Hayes wrote. ""He supported and funded virtually all others—including jihadists who targeted the United States, its interests, and allies."" According to Hayes’ account, Hussein supported the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood in the early 1980s; aided the escape and offered refuge to Abdul Rahman Yasin, a conspirator in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center; and supported a suicide-bomber plot to assassinate former President George H.W. Bush during a visit to Kuwait. Hayes, like Bergen, cites the 2008 Institute for Defense Analyses study, but he focused on a broader definition of terrorist activities, rather than just the 9/11 link. Hayes wrote that the report concluded, ""Evidence shows that Saddam's use of terrorist tactics and his support for terrorist groups remained strong up until the collapse of the regime."" • How Hussein handled ""terrorists"" represents a small part of his legacy. Focusing on how Hussein  handled terrorists overlooks a much bigger issue -- his massive violations of Iraqis’ human rights. On the eve of the Iraq War in 2003, the New York Times reported that ""accounts collected by Western human rights groups from Iraqi émigrés and defectors have suggested that the number of those who have ‘disappeared' into the hands of the secret police, never to be heard from again, could be 200,000."" And that doesn’t include an even larger number believed to have been killed during the Iran-Iraq War and the Persian Gulf War. ""He didn't just kill terrorists,"" Limbert said. ""He gassed and otherwise murdered Kurds, Shia, and anyone else he didn't like."" • Hussein's model of handling isn’t a viable option for the United States. Put simply, the United States is a democratic nation with a constitution, not an authoritarian dictatorship. Indeed, some have criticized the Obama administration for a lack of due process in drone strikes on terrorists overseas -- a far more limited action than the kind of mass killings Hussein oversaw. ""Reasonable people can differ on whether Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism constituted a threat great enough to go to war in an attempt to eliminate it,"" Hayes concluded in his article. ""But no reasonable person can cite Saddam Hussein as a model for an approach to handling jihadist terror."" Gartenstein-Ross agreed that any discussion of Hussein's methods of controlling terrorism are, at most, academic rather than practical. ""I absolutely do not find Saddam’s methods of dealing with terrorism applicable to the United States,"" he said. ""Extreme repression like that is a self-defeating strategy."" Our ruling Trump said Saddam Hussein ""did well. He killed terrorists."" Trump has a point in saying that Hussein's Iraq was free of the widespread Islamic terrorism that flourishes there now. On the other hand, Hussein's opposition to terrorism sprung largely from a desire to eliminate opponents to his rule; by contrast, he was willing to support terrorism as long as it advanced his interests beyond Iraq’s borders. And it’s not as if Hussein's methods offer a helpful model for a democracy like the United States. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c2fb9157-7ea1-445b-af4a-4f133f8ab00c",/factchecks/2016/jul/07/donald-trump/was-saddam-hussein-good-killing-terrorists-donald-/
"['Global News Service', 'Economy', 'Foreign Policy', 'Morten Jerven']","
Tracking global poverty: Do we have the real numbers?
","The success story of aid groups in developing countries often includes a line about lifting people out of poverty. But what if the data behind such claims was suspect? That’s the contention of economist Morten Jerven at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Jerven, a noted skeptic of African development statistics, says it’s a case of the ""PR department getting ahead of the knowledge department."" For 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, ""we simply do not have data to say anything about trends in poverty,"" Jerven wrote recently. As fact-checkers, we at PolitiFact can be asked to rely on the data Jerven is calling into question. So we decided to put his claim to the test. It takes two data points to tango Jerven based his claim on a simple law about measuring things: If you want to spot a trend, you need to have a starting point and an end point. Importantly, you need to measure the same thing at both times. To give a crude example, if one year you ask people how much they earn and 10 years later ask them how much their entire household makes, you can see how it would be difficult to make comparisons and draw conclusions. The World Bank identified problems with the data points for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. ""By 2012, only 27 of the region’s 48 countries had conducted at least two comparable surveys since 1990 to track poverty,"" a 2016 report said. Do the math, and you get Jerven’s 21 countries without a starting and an end point on poverty. Andrew Dabalen, lead economist in the World Bank’s Poverty and Equity Global Practice, doesn’t quibble with Jerven’s statement, at least not too much. He and his colleagues vet the data that comes out of Africa. In some countries, such as Liberia and Sudan, there’s just one survey. Somalia has none. Kenya has four, but each was too different from the others to make any firm conclusions. Where do surveys run into issues? They might not match because they drew from different areas -- say a national sample versus urban residents. Some had people fill out daily diaries, while others asked people after the fact to remember what they bought or produced for themselves. Simply taking a survey at different times of the year, harvest versus planting season, could radically change the results. ""Based on the review using these criteria, we find that indeed 21 countries did not have at least two comparable surveys to say something about trends,"" Dabalen told us. Keeping things consistent is not a trivial issue, or a new one. In the mid 1990s, India shifted from asking people what they consumed in the past month to what they consumed in variety of time periods -- from as short as one week to as long as a year. Virtually overnight, the official number of people in poverty fell by about 200 million, a result that many analysts challenged. Even in the United States, scientists often fret anytime the U.S. Census Bureau debates or discusses changing the questions it asks, for fear that it will jeopardize useful data. Filling in the gaps Confronted with missing data, Dabalen and his colleagues have a few workarounds that can help in some places. Numbers for an entire nation’s economy, its gross domestic product, are generally available. Dabalen said you can use GDP trends to estimate household consumption, and from that, derive a poverty level. ""Such a method has its issues, but it is used widely and under certain assumptions, it predicts reasonably well,"" Dabalen said. But it’s not perfect. Branko Milanovic, senior scholar and specialist in global inequality at the CUNY Graduate Center, said the most you can learn from GDP is how things changed on average. If most of the economic growth flowed to the wealthy, the poor might gain little. (The income gains of the top 1 percent to 5 percent in the United States in recent years is a good example.) ""A change in the mean does not tell us anything about the change in the distribution,"" Milanovic said. Dabalen told us about other techniques that derive missing numbers from a range of surveys that can tie economic well-being to other measures such as spending on food, housing conditions or education levels. On a large scale, looking at an entire region, this statistical alchemy can at least show the direction of change. This World Bank chart tracks results for 48 Sub-Saharan nations. The blue line is based only on countries with solid, comparable data. The other lines rely on something less than that.  So policy makers can have a sense of the trends in poverty, even if they can’t say for sure what the poverty level is. But again, that’s from a regional vantage point. For any single country with very limited data, these techniques get dicey. According to the World Bank, the use of alternative surveys to fill in missing information sometimes showed poverty going down, when based on more reliable numbers, it was actually going up. Steps are under way to deal with the larger data problem, but a lot of work remains. Oddly, the lack of hard data doesn’t necessarily mean that poverty is worse than we think. Dabalen and his colleagues wrote that a number of crosschecks of all the information ""support the notion that poverty reduction may have been larger than assumed."" Our ruling  Jerven said that for 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa,  ""we simply do not have data to say anything about trends in poverty."" His number comes directly from a careful vetting of poverty surveys by the World Bank. That analysis described in detail the holes in the information needed to track poverty. Jerven pushed his point a bit too far by saying that we can’t say anything about trends. Alternative methods give a reasonably reliable picture of overall trends, even if they can’t tell policy makers what the actual poverty rate might be. But at the end of the day, the consensus among the experts we reached is that the gap Jerven talked about is real and rather than use workaround techniques, everyone would prefer solid data. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/26108662-dcbd-407b-aabe-b10379895175",/factchecks/2016/jul/07/morten-jerven/tracking-global-poverty-have-real-numbers/
"['Nevada', 'Transportation', 'Freedom Partners Action Fund']","
Super PAC inaccurate in linking Nevada Senate candidate to Uber shutdown
","Catherine Cortez Masto is once again taking fire from a Koch Brothers-backed group attacking her record as the state’s attorney general. Freedom Partners Action Fund is spending $1.2 million on a new television ad campaign accusing the Nevada Democratic Senate candidate of ""driving away jobs"" by forcibly shutting down popular ride-hailing company Uber in Nevada. ""Many Nevadans relied on Uber for work, but after accepting $70,000 from taxi companies, Catherine Cortez Masto went after Uber — once, twice, three times — until she drove them out of town, along with all their jobs,"" the ad says. Let’s be clear — Uber has been operating in Nevada for about a year. But is it true that Cortez Masto pushed out Uber and drove away jobs in 2014? No free rides Uber didn’t have the smoothest ride into Nevada. Speculation around the company launching was running rampant in 2014 as Uber eyed Nevada and tourist-friendly Las Vegas as one of the most lucrative markets without ride-hailing companies operating (Uber considered Nevada in 2012 but backed out). But Uber’s normal strategy of legally questionable, high-profile launches was a more difficult bar to clear in Nevada, where the closely-regulated taxi market is ruled by incredibly strict regulations. The rules include an explicit prohibition in state law on any company entering the market unless it can prove it wouldn’t ""adversely affect other carriers operating in the territory."" Nevada also has a confusing regulatory structure for overseeing cab drivers. The Nevada Taxicab Authority oversees Las Vegas, while the Transportation Authority regulates the rest of the state. Both regulators fall under the Department of Business and Industry, which Director Bruce Breslow said attempted to negotiate Uber’s entry into the market before it suddenly launched statewide on Oct. 24, 2014. ""In the middle of trying to help them, they decided to operate without authority and illegally at the time in Nevada,"" Breslow said. Despite being told by regulators that Uber would need to apply under existing rules for new taxi companies, the company argued its non-traditional business model didn’t fall under decades-old state regulations. State officials disagreed, and quickly cracked down. Uber drivers caught by regulators were immediately cited and their cars impounded, and the Attorney General’s office quickly filed suit to shut Uber down. In an interview, a spokesman for Freedom Partners said Cortez Masto’s ""overaggressive legal fight"" justified the ad. ""The reality is that Uber was operating in the absence of regulations, not in spite of them, and the state Legislature ultimately codified what Nevadans already knew: Uber is not a taxi company and should not be subject to their regulations,"" spokesman Bill Riggs said in an email. So how much wiggle room did Cortez Masto have in going after Uber, and was her legal strategy as overzealous as the ad claims? Jurisdictional fights The ad claims Cortez Masto went after Uber ""three times"" until the company was driven out of the state — a reference to three attempted requests for temporary restraining orders filed on the same day Uber launched. The requests, which were filed in Carson City, Reno and Las Vegas, created a legal mess with several justices attempting to claim the case, including one Las Vegas-based justice suggesting that the Attorney General’s office was ""jumping around to different jurisdictions trying to get a ruling."" Nevada’s state Supreme Court eventually ruled on the jurisdictional fight, sending the case to a Reno district court, which promptly granted an injunction against Uber (the company soon after ""temporarily suspended operations"").  Freedom Partners claims this ""overaggressive legal fight"" drove Uber out of the state and cost jobs, but the truth is more complicated. Former Chief Deputy Attorney General Gina Session oversaw the Uber case. She said the office filed in three courts because they were pressed for time and weren't totally sure if an injunction filed in one jurisdiction would apply statewide — especially because Nevada has two geographically-based regulatory bodies covering the taxi industry. (Uber launched unexpectedly on a Friday). Former Deputy Attorney General Colleen Platt said the rush to file the suits that Friday meant they weren’t submitted with the usually required documentation, adding to the confusion. A panel of state Supreme Court justices called the multiple lawsuits an ""inept effort"" ignoring procedural rules, but didn’t find any evidence proving the office was searching for a more favorable court (though one dissenting justice said it gave ""an appearance of improper forum shopping""). Former Nevada Transportation Authority chairman Andrew MacKay said the massive size of Uber’s workforce dwarfed the enforcement capabilities of state regulators, meaning the only real maneuver available was a court-ordered restraining order. MacKay, who disclosed that he’s supporting Republican Joe Heck in the state’s Senate race, detailed some of the issues with Uber in a three-page affidavit describing the more stringent requirements of Nevada’s cab companies. Although Freedom Partners argues Uber’s business model didn’t fall under existing law, state regulators unanimously agreed that Uber met the definition of a ""common motor carrier"" and needed to follow the applicable laws. Legal discretion, wiggle room The ad raises the question of how much discretion Cortez Masto had in going after Uber, and how much of the ""blame"" she deserves. Session said the Attorney General’s office generally serves as primary legal counsel for state agencies and departments, and that the actions taken against Uber fit Cortez Masto’s approach to her job. ""This was generally the way our office operated,"" Session said. ""Unless our clients were asking us to do something that was clearly illegal, we followed the will of our clients."" MacKay, chairman of the state’s ""client"" in the case against Uber, said it’s theoretically possible that Cortez Masto could have ignored the will of the state and not filed suit, but it would have been highly unusual.  ""I couldn’t foresee the AG or any AG not enforcing state law,"" MacKay said. There are several high-profile examples of Cortez Masto’s discretion in which cases to take, twice determining not to follow through on requests from Republican governors on politically-charged issues. Freedom Partners also linked to a similar situation in Virginia that was resolved more peacefully. Donations & job losses As for the ad’s reference to $72,626 from taxi donations, Freedom Partners provided PolitiFact with a spreadsheet of taxi company donations to Cortez Masto between 2005 and 2010. PolitiFact double-checked the numbers and found them to be accurate, though close to $26,000 were ""in-kind"" donations which went to reserving billboard ads. Session did say she declined requests from taxi companies who wanted to latch on to the state’s lawsuit in order to avoid the appearance that they were doing the taxi industry’s bidding. As for the job losses, Uber at the time claimed that roughly 1,000 drivers lost their jobs ""overnight"" due to the state’s legal fight, though there’s no clear way to double check that figure.  Regardless, Uber hired an army of lobbyists in 2015 and pushed through legislation allowing so-called ""Transportation Network Companies"" to legally operate in the state, roughly a year after the initial legal skirmishes. Our ruling A Freedom Partners Action Fund ad claims that Cortez Masto ""went after Uber ... until she drove them out of town"" after receiving tens of thousands of dollars in donations from taxi companies. Freedom Partners got a couple of the details right in the amount of taxi industry donations and Cortez Masto’s aggressive legal actions against Uber. But there’s a convincing argument that Uber at the very least bent the rules, and it’s clear that Cortez Masto didn’t have some sort of individual vendetta against the ride-hailing company — her office was working with state regulators who specifically requested the attorney general take action. The ad also neglects to mention how Uber only temporarily left town. The ridesharing service is very much up and running through Nevada a year after its initial skirmish with the state. Because this ad takes things out of context, we rate it Mostly False. Editor's note: This story was updated shortly after publication to clarify how the state Attorney General's office responded to Uber's launch on Friday, Oct. 24, 2014. ",/factchecks/2016/jul/07/freedom-partners-action-fund/super-pac-inaccurate-linking-nevada-senate-candida/
"['Campaign Finance', 'Florida', 'Alan Grayson']","
Alan Grayson calls out Patrick Murphy for Wall Street contributions
","In the race for Marco Rubio’s Senate seat, Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson warned that Rep. Patrick Murphy’s campaign contributions from Wall Street make him far less progressive than what Democrats need in the upper chamber. Grayson made the comment during an interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board June 30 when probed about why he doesn’t see eye-to-eye with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Grayson cited Schumer’s long history of Wall Street support to explain why their ideologies don’t connect. Then he hypothesized why Schumer backed Murphy over him. ""Guess who has taken more money than any Democrat from Wall Street?"" Grayson said, adding that the person was a ""certain second-term congressman from Florida who serves in the financial services committee and has no standing in the committee other than the simple right to vote."" He continued: ""His name is Patrick Murphy, and he's taken more money from Wall Street than any other member of Congress other than the speaker and the majority leader."" Murphy, of Jupiter, has only been in Congress since 2013, after he switched his party affiliation from Republican to Democrat. We wondered if it was really possible that Murphy received so much money from Wall Street, and why. For this fact-check we’re only looking at direct contributions made to Murphy’s campaign committee, not super PACs or other organizations that can accept unlimited contributions on his behalf.   2016 contributions check out When looking at just the House, Grayson’s point checks out. But technically, Grayson’s statement to the editorial board said Murphy received more money than anyone else in Congress — which comprises two chambers. When you add senators into the mix, Murphy’s contributions from Wall Street-types rank No. 19 overall. (Not bad for 535 members, but still not No. 3) That said, it’s pretty clear from context that Grayson was limiting his statement to members of the House, and for some, the House is ""Congress"" and the Senate is the Senate. ""​While Congress can — and probably should — mean both chambers, many people use ‘Congress’ to refer to the House, and Senate to refer to the Senate,"" said Christopher Mann, an associate professor in the political science department at Skidmore College. Senators typically receive more Wall Street money because there are fewer of them, so they have more impact on legislation. In addition, senators have more expensive races and therefore ask for more money. Let’s go back to the House. Grayson was referencing a study by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that analyzes campaign donations, that showed Murphy received $1.41 million from the ""finance, insurance and real estate"" sector in the 2016 election cycle. That amount placed Murphy third among all members of the House, with Speaker Paul Ryan at No. 1 with nearly $2 million, and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., at No. 2 with $1.58 million. For similar fact-checks, the Center for Responsive Politics has said the best method to find how much money is being donated by Wall Street workers is to look at a subset of this category, called the ""securities and investment"" sector. This subcategory captures the greatest number of companies associated with Wall Street, without the other fields under the ""finance, insurance and real estate"" umbrella. Even if you look at it this way, Murphy still places third for those kind of contributions among members of the House. Murphy received $352,500 from the securities and investment sector, according to a 2016 analysis from the Center for Responsive Politics. Ahead of Murphy is Ryan with $831,272 and McCarthy with $497,850. Murphy’s money from Wall Street-related industries amounts to about 4.5 percent of the $7.71 million he’s received so far. Why all the love? So why does Wall Street support Murphy so much? A couple of reasons. As Grayson said, Murphy is a member of the House Committee on Financial Services. Even though he is not a ranking member, he is on two subcommittees that deal with laws related to capital markets and another on monetary policy and trade. These industries want to be on Murphy’s ""good side,"" Mann said. The bigger reason probably has more to do with Murphy’s goal and its location: The U.S. Senate, representing Florida. Florida is an ""expensive state"" for political races, Mann said, and Murphy is going to the industries he knows. Murphy has raised more money from three other sectors than Wall Street in his 2015-16 campaign. Murphy raised $721,969 from employees of law firms and lawyers, $595,238 from retirees, and $474,600 from the real estate industry. Also keep in mind that Grayson’s talking point only works for the 2015-16 election cycle. He didn’t specify a point in time for the donations. In his first bid for office in 2012, Murphy received $100,600 from the securities and investment sector. In his 2014 race, Murphy received $255,880 from the securities and investment sector, making him No. 22 among all House members. For the curious, the majority of Grayson’s $2.5 million in contributions comes from retirees, law firms and lawyers, miscellaneous issues, which includes a variety of groups that focus on a single-issue, non-profit institutions and real estate. Our ruling Grayson said Murphy has ""taken more money from Wall Street than any other member of Congress other than the speaker and the majority leader."" Grayson is right that in the 2015-16 cycle, Murphy raised more money from employees of Wall Street-related fields than any other House member after the House speaker and majority leader. Murphy did not raise as much in his previous two congressional bids, but in context it is clear that Grayson was talking about their current race for the Senate. We rate this statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8373c4d3-f23b-40ca-a0a0-0b0e845b7522",/factchecks/2016/jul/07/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-calls-out-patrick-murphy-wall-street-/

","In the wake of the Orlando shootings and lacking congressional action regarding gun reform legislation, many are calling attention to the the devastating truths about gun violence in the United States. One of the vocal supporters advocating for tighter gun restrictions is Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. Wasserman Schultz took to her Medium page to lament the occurrence at Pulse Night Club and to express the need for stricter gun legislation that she believes can prevent future gun violence fatalities, especially by suspected terrorists. In her June 18, 2016, post, Wasserman Schultz wrote that ""40% of Americans know someone who has been killed by a gun — gun violence has touched someone you know."" Many other politicians have made many claims regarding gun violence, but this assertion seemed particularly far-reaching. Do two out of every five Americans know someone whose death can be attributed to a gun? We took a closer look. The evidence We reached out to one of Wasserman Schultz’s campaign representatives, and they told us that the 40 percent figure came from an October 2015 Huffington Post article that cited a YouGov poll from the same month. YouGov is an online market research organization that utilizes a network of over 4 million users who offer their personal views and experiences by participating in surveys. The poll that Wasserman Schultz refers to surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults selected by a random sample stratified by age, gender, race, education and region. One of the questions asked in the survey was, ""Do you personally know anyone who has been killed by another person with a gun?"" The poll found that 22 percent said yes, with 6 percent saying the person was in their family and the other 16 percent saying it was someone else they knew. Another question asked, ""Do you personally know anyone who has committed suicide using a gun?"" On that question, 28 percent of participants answered yes, with 7 percent knowing a family member who used a gun to commit suicide and 21 percent saying they knew someone else who committed suicide with a gun. The 40 percent figure asserted by the Huffington Post article as well as in Wasserman Schultz’s Medium post come from the total percentage of participants who had professed to knowing someone who had died because of a gun. The 40 percent figure is reached once you take into account the overlap between the respondents who knew both a homicide and a suicide victim. We reached out to to Peter Moore of YouGov, who published the poll online, to ask if Wasserman Schultz’s claim accurately encapsulated the results. ""I’ve had a look at the full dataset, and I can confirm that the 40 percent figure is accurate,"" Moore said. ""Her statement does properly capture the poll’s findings. It is also consistent with other similar survey data."" We asked Moore about possible sources of error in the survey, and he responded, ""There are none in particular beyond the general margins of error associated with surveys,"" which was determined to be 4.1 percent by YouGov. To contextualize the YouGov poll, we reached out to James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology, law and public policy at Northeastern University. While not debating the results or methodology of the poll, he did offer some caveats. He noted that suicides account for a large share of the deaths -- a fact that may not be obvious from Wasserman Schultz’s statements. He also said that the poll’s wording leaves a fair amount of interpretation to the respondent. Respondents ""have to decide how well they know someone,"" he said. ""There are better ways to write questions like this so it’s not so vague."" In all, the way the questions were worded may make the percentage sound ""a lot worse than it is,"" Fox said. Past data While there have been many surveys conducted regarding guns and gun violence, the most similar polls to the YouGov poll were surveys conducted in 1993 and 1999 by Gallup. The question in both years was, ""Not including military combat, has anyone close to you--such as a friend or relative--ever been shot by a gun?"" In 1993, 64 percent responded no and 36 percent responded yes. In 1999, the percentage of people answering yes dropped to 31 percent, compared to 69 percent responding no. It’s important to note that the Gallup questions refer to people getting shot -- a larger universe than those getting shot and killed. So, it’s not a direct comparison. Though the Gallup results can by no means confirm or refute YouGov and Wasserman Schultz’s claim, the numbers do not appear drastically different. With limited inquiry into the number of people who are close to victims of gun violence, it is difficult to ascertain a clear estimate. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said, ""40 percent of Americans know someone who has been killed by a gun ."" Wasserman Schultz is right about the 40 percent figure if you consider the YouGov poll findings. It’s important to note that a majority of the 40 percent figure comes from suicide deaths, not homicides. And there is limited research on this topic generally. Overall, we rate her claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/26bdb266-7613-4006-af9c-19d4e47313e8",/factchecks/2016/jul/07/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-right-about-far-reaching-/

Donald Trump isn't winging it in complaint about Air Force One campaign costs
","It's a political fact of life: Incumbency has its perks. You're already in a position of power. Name recognition is not a problem. And, if you're president, your arrival at a venue — whether for campaign reasons or not — is bound to generate headlines.   That's the underlying complaint of a tweet presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sent out July 5 as his presumptive Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, was preparing to join President Barack Obama aboard Air Force One for a campaign trip to North Carolina. ""Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail"" by President Obama and Hillary Clinton, Trump said.  We wondered if it was true that the trip was going to be made at taxpayer expense. To some degree, it is. And that's out of necessity. The president doesn't stop being president just because he's campaigning for himself or someone else. Even if he flew to a campaign stop on a commercial jet, he would need a host of support services and personnel to keep him connected and in charge. And that doesn't include the requirements for security. Thus, the president always uses Air Force One, which is one of two specially designed Boeing 747s built in 1986 to include a command center, a medical suite, bedroom, office, two food preparation galleys, and plenty of room for staff and reporters. It's not cheap to operate. According to CNN, the Air Force was reporting two years ago it cost $206,337 an hour to operate the jet. It's not clear what that covers. A General Accounting Office analysis of three overseas presidential trips in 1998 reported an hourly cost of $34,400, which would be $50,700 per hour in 2016 dollars. Technically, if the president makes a campaign trip, the campaign or the political party is supposed to reimburse the government for use of the plane to some degree. (The full cost is not reimbursed because some of the costs are directly connected to the responsibilities of being president.) These days, the amount is the price of chartering a 737, which is a bit over $11,000 an hour, according to the Washington Post. Prior to 2010, the required reimbursement was nothing more than the cost of a first-class ticket on a commercial airline. When you have someone traveling on behalf of a campaign, such as Clinton and any staffers who might be accompanying her, the accounting can get even more complicated. But how it's calculated by the White House Airlift Operations office isn't known. The government does not release details of how it figures such costs, and that's been a secret going back to the 1970s, according to CNN. The amount is even more complicated when the president mixes business with politics, such as flying somewhere to give a policy speech or performing another official act but also spending time attending a purely political event, such as a fundraiser. (The North Carolina appearance, in contrast, was purely political.) How much taxpayers end up paying when business is mixed with politics isn't clear because, once again, the formula for calculating the share paid by the campaign and the government is secret. The White House Counsel's office makes a determination on how political a trip is, according to Time magazine. Mark Knoller, the CBS News White House correspondent who has been tracking presidential trips for years, noted in a tweet that presidents have repeatedly told the press that such costs will not be revealed. > ""Prior administrations also refused,"" he noted in a followup tweet. ""But they didn't claim to be most transparent Admins ever."" The closest you can get to getting an estimate is to see what the campaigns pay the government. For his re-election in 2004, George W. Bush's campaign paid just under $1 million, according to the Post. But that was when the cost was based on a first-class commercial airline ticket. By 2012, after the rules were changed to be based on chartering a 737, Obama spent just over $3 million. In this case, Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said the campaign will cover its portion of the costs, although he indicated those costs had not been determined. The Trump campaign didn't respond to an email, but Trump is well aware that campaigns are required, by federal law, to reimburse for expenses. During his trip to Scotland last month, Trump went to great lengths to repeatedly state that federal law requires his campaign to pay for everything, even if it's the use of a conference room in Trump Towers, which he said he would gladly let his campaign use for free. ""I'm forced, you know, legally, I have to pay myself back,"" he said. ""If I use one of my resorts in the United States and we have a press conference or something, by law I have to pay myself back."" Our ruling Trump said, ""Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail"" by Obama and Clinton. How people define a fortune is somewhat subjective, and details about how the costs of using the presidential plane are determined are secret.  But based on the information available, it's clear that the campaign is only going to be picking up a small fraction of the $200,000-plus hourly costs of using the plane, with taxpayers footing the bill for the rest. Because Trump's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/aa60cf08-a414-40d2-b91a-70999d4188a2",/factchecks/2016/jul/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-isnt-winging-it-complaint-about-air-f/

FBI findings tear holes in Hillary Clinton's email defense
","The results of an FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state shredded Clinton’s most oft-recited defense — that she never sent or received information marked classified. Clinton made the case for a year and as recently as Saturday, hours after being interviewed by investigators. ""Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now,"" Clinton said July 2, 2016. ""I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified."" In reality, Clinton has made the same general claim two ways. At a Democratic debate in February, Clinton said, ""I never sent or received any classified material."" Other times she’s added the qualifier that she never sent material ""marked"" classified. We previously found that Clinton was spinning what was publicly known about the FBI investigation and Clinton’s emails. We rated her claim Half True. (See an archived version of that fact-check.) Now we know it’s just plain wrong. At PolitiFact, our policy is that we fact-check statements and claims using the information available at the time. That policy stands. But in this case, while the evidence FBI director James B. Comey presented wasn’t available to us, it was available to Clinton through her own emails. She had every opportunity to present an accurate accounting in comments to the public and voters. She did not do that. We think it’s important to make the record abundantly clear. We’ve decided to look at Clinton’s claim again with the information that was available to her when she spoke but only became available publicly July 5. The claim In an interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd hours after being interviewed by the FBI, Todd asked Clinton how her practices did not violate federal law. ""Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now,"" Clinton responded. ""I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified."" Comey’s statement directly contradicted that point. FBI investigators reviewed the 30,000 emails Clinton turned over to the State Department in 2014. The investigation found ""a very small number"" contained classification markings at the time they were sent. The State Department confirmed July 6 that it was aware of two emails that were marked confidential, the lowest level of classification, when they were sent. An aide sent the two emails to Clinton to prepare her for phone calls with foreign leaders, according to the New York Times.   State Department spokesman John Kirby said call sheets are often classified when they are prepared. But then at some point before the call is made, someone with the appropriate authority will declassify them. These two call sheets sent to Clinton unnecessarily retained their confidential markings due to human error, Kirby said. Even though just two emails out of many thousands were marked classified at the time they were sent, it’s more than the number Clinton cited: zero. In total, the investigation found 110 emails in 52 email chains containing information that was classified at the time it was sent or received. Eight chains contained top secret information, the highest level of classification, 36 chains contained secret information, and the remaining eight contained confidential information. Most of these emails, however, did not contain markings clearly delineating their status. Even so, Clinton and her team still should have known the information was not appropriate for an unclassified system, Comey said.   ""There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about the matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation,"" Comey said of some of the top secret chains. About 2,000 additional emails have been retroactively classified, or up-classified, meaning the information was not classified when it was first emailed. This is a regular practice when documents are reviewed for release, according to transparency experts. Throughout this saga, Clinton has said she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department. But Comey said FBI investigators uncovered ""several thousand"" work-related emails that she had not handed over, and three of those were classified at the time they were sent, though they were not marked as such. Comey added that some work-related emails are still out there, but FBI investigators were unable to find them. It’s possible those emails could contain classified information. The Clinton campaign told PolitiFact they do not know which emails Comey is referring to and reiterated the fact that the State Department has not said any were classified at the time they were sent. The context Some of Clinton’s emails now made public actually show Clinton’s team talking about how they couldn’t email each other classified information over the private server and instead have to move the conversation to a more appropriate venue. Clinton has said she viewed classified information in hard copy in her office. If she was traveling, she used other secure channels. But the FBI investigation found that Clinton sent and received classified information over her private server. Why the disconnect? Experts say the story here is more about the dysfunction of government classification than about how Clinton regularly handled sensitive information. Agencies regularly disagree over what should be classified or not. As the email story has unfolded, the State Department has squabbled with the intelligence community over whether certain emails should be classified today and if it was classified back when it was sent during Clinton’s tenure. ""The decision to mark a document is more art than science and leads to bureaucratic in-fighting on whether something should be classified or not,"" said Gary Bass, Bauman Foundation executive director and former director of OMB Watch, a government accountability organization. Also, transparency advocates say the government regularly classifies more than it needs to. The government classifies incorrectly 70 percent of the time, according to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel. Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University said some of the classified material the FBI identified might not be particularly sensitive."" There is not a line in any of Mrs. Clinton's emails that meets the smell test of classification, which is their release would be damaging to our national security,"" he said. Given these concerns, it’s reasonable to give Clinton a little benefit of the doubt regarding how she treated classified information that landed in her inbox unlabeled, said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. ""If it had been marked as classified and she or her staff transmitted it through non-secure email anyway, that would have been an overt violation of procedures,"" Aftergood said. ""If it wasn't marked as classified, then it could easily have been handled in good faith as unclassified."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified."" Clinton has made this claim over and over again. An independent FBI investigation has found that to be inaccurate. It’s important to remember that only ""a very small number"" of her emails, two, were marked classified when they were first sent, and just 110 out of the 30,000 she turned over were classified but unmarked. Evidence seems to indicate that Clinton generally dealt with classified information in an appropriate manner. But over the course of a year, Clinton and her staff have painted a picture of an email setup where absolutely zero classified information slipped through the cracks, case closed. We rate this statement False. Editor's note: The day after we published this fact-check, Comey testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on July 7. Comey said he believes three emails on Clinton's server contained information labeled classified at the time they were sent. This information was not properly marked in that the emails did not have a classification header, even though a ""(c)"" immediately preceded text in the body of the emails, designating confidential information. Without the clear classification header, it's reasonable to infer that Clinton did not realize these three emails contained classified information, he said.",/factchecks/2016/jul/06/hillary-clinton/fbi-findings-tear-holes-hillary-clintons-email-def/

Pro-Trump super PAC compares Bill Clinton to Cosby in attack on Hillary
","Donald Trump has often attacked Hillary Clinton’s treatment of women by accusing her of enabling former president Bill Clinton’s sexual impropriety. A new ad from pro-Trump super PAC Rebuilding America Now did the same, citing tweets, excerpts from a New York Times article and Hillary Clinton’s own words. Referring to Bill Clinton's accusers, the ad claims that Hillary Clinton ""stage-managed their destruction from a White House war room. She savaged their dignity and shamed them."" The video attributes several quotations to Hillary Clinton, which we’ll explore later. We fact checked each individually to see if any were taken out of context. But before that, there’s some history you need to understand. Accusations The Washington Post published a guide to Bill Clinton’s alleged impropriety, dividing claims against him into alleged consensual acts and alleged harassment or assault. Five women have alleged consensual affairs, and three others harassment or assault, according to the Post. Bill Clinton has not been found guilty in any court of the accusations.  Sources other than the Washington Post — such as the conservative website Breitbart — have higher numbers on how many women Clinton allegedly assaulted or harassed. The pro-Trump video does not name specific women, and a spokesperson for the super PAC declined to go into more detail. Experts we reached out to had opposing views on both the ad’s overarching message and on the substance of the alleged incidents. We didn't weigh in on those issues.  What we could fact-check, however, was whether the ad accurately depicted Hillary Clinton’s quotes. Let’s go one by one. The ‘Cosby’ tweet The ad says, ""When Bill Cosby was accused of sexual assault, Mrs. Clinton tweeted, ‘Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be believe.’ "" The ad initially references a Nov. 22, 2015, Hillary Clinton tweet on sexual assault. The text of the tweet is accurate. She made similar claims at a rally two weeks later, adding that survivors ought to be believed until ""disbelieved"" by evidence. But the tweet is not easily identifiable as a direct reference to Cosby. The tweet itself links to Clinton’s plans to tackle sexual assault in college. This might not be a coincidence — CNN aired a version of a documentary on campus assault the same day. The Cosby allegations were in the news at the time, although we were unable to find any specific Cosby-related incident that day. The closest was on Nov. 13, when four women joined a defamation lawsuit against the comedian. No evidence from the tweet itself, however, directly suggests she responded to Cosby. ‘Loony toon’ The ad, turning to allegations against Bill Clinton, said Hillary Clinton called her husband’s accusers ""loony toon."" The ""loony toon"" comment comes from the diaries of Diane Blair, a former University of Arkansas professor and friend of the Clintons. According to those notes, Hillary Clinton referred to Monica Lewinsky — whom the Post lists as a consensual affair — as a ""narcissistic loony toon."" The citation is correctly attributed to Blair’s diaries. The accuracy of what Blair wrote is impossible to determine. The ad claims Clinton was referring to sexual assault accusers, but she was speaking of only one woman — Lewinsky.  Experts had differing takes on whether the ""Lewinsky affair"" was consensual or not. ‘Floozy, bimbo and stalker’ The ad says ""The Clinton effort used words like ‘floozy, bimbo and stalker.' "" Note, it does not say Clinton said these words — which she didn't.  The terms are found in a book — Target: Caught in the Crosshairs of Bill and Hillary Clinton — by Kathleen Willey, a woman who accused Bill Clinton of groping her. The language is also found in a New York Times article. In the book, Willey writes that Robert Bennett — Bill Clinton’s former lawyer — referred to her in conversations with CBS producers as a ""floozy, bimbo flake."" The book attributes the ""stalker"" remark to Sidney Blumenthal — a former White House aide — speaking with author Christopher Hitchens. The quotations do come from an identifiable source, but again it is impossible to determine whether the quotes themselves are accurate. ‘A lot to answer for’ The ad claims that referring to the women, Hillary Clinton said ""some folks are going to have a lot to answer for."" The comment comes from a Today show interview with Matt Lauer on Jan. 27, 1998, soon after news of the Lewinsky affair broke. Lauer asks Clinton about her role defending her husband. ""The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president,"" Clinton said. She goes on to note prior attempts to shut down her husband’s political aspirations, eventually declaring the allegations are ""not going to be proven true."" ""And I think that when all of this is put into context, and we really look at the people involved here, look at their motivations and look at their backgrounds, look at their past behavior, some folks are going to have a lot to answer for,"" she said. This could be interpreted as targeting the women making the accusations, but alternatively it could also be targeting various ""right-wing"" political operatives based on the interview’s prior context. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker, which previously looked into the ad, noted the ambiguity. A spokesman for the pro-Trump PAC acknowledged it as well, but found their interpretation plausible based on books alleging Clinton mistreated female accusers. The ad claims Clinton was questioning the accounts of the women involved. Going back to the source, that is not certain. The Clinton camp declined to go on record for this fact-check. Our ruling A pro-Trump advertisement makes several claims about Hillary Clinton’s hypocritical treatment of women, relying primarily on her own words or those of close confidants. The broader message — that Clinton enabled her husband’s alleged sexual assaults — has been and continues to be debated, by pundits and experts alike. We didn't weigh in on those arguments, but we did look into the ad’s more specific use of quotes attributed to Clinton. The quotes themselves are hearsay in some cases and subject to different interpretations based on context. The ad further misleads by saying Hillary Clinton ""savaged"" the dignity of people who accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment or assault ""and shamed them."" We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/26258019-ded0-4ed2-aec3-33d9bb6b14d6",/factchecks/2016/jul/06/america-rising-now/pro-trump-super-pac-compares-bill-clinton-cosby-at/

Testing Russ Feingold claim about opponent Ron Johnson's views on trade, help for workers
","Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson tells viewers in a new television ad, ""I respect you enough to tell you the truth.""   But his Democratic challenger has suggested otherwise. At a Milwaukee campaign event in May 2016, Russ Feingold said Johnson touted a worker protection program called Trade Adjustment Assistance to justify his support for free trade agreements — even though Johnson had sought to eliminate the program. Feingold said: ""Let's be very clear. Senator Johnson says — to excuse his position on trade agreements — he says, well, we have the TAA. Guess who voted to eliminate it."" When Feingold was asked by reporters to elaborate, he said Johnson voted at least once against providing three-year grants to technical colleges to train displaced workers who were eligible for the program. Is Feingold right? How the program works The Trade Adjustment Assistance program dates to the 1970s and was created to help workers who lost their jobs -- or whose wages or hours have been cut -- because of foreign competition. The program, in part, offers displaced workers temporary benefits and pays to train them with new skills so they can find a new job. In Wisconsin, the federal government has spent nearly $220 million in the last six years for worker benefits and training, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. That includes money for enhanced vocational training through the state’s technical colleges in programs such as information technology, healthcare and manufacturing. Proponents of the TAA program say it can lessen the blow of job losses that occur when companies move operations overseas to reduce labor costs — a practice that critics contend is facilitated by free trade agreements the United States has struck with other countries. Johnson has voiced general support for free trade, while Feingold voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement when he was a U.S. senator and has opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Feingold’s claim has two parts: Did Johnson specifically cite the Trade Adjustment Assistance program as a defense of trade agreements? When we asked Feingold’s campaign for backup, officials pointed to a statement Johnson made in a May 2015 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article: ""Free trade does help all economies. And there are dislocations. There are protections against those dislocations. We all support being able to help workers that have been displaced."" Despite what Feingold said, Johnson did not explicitly refer to the TAA in that statement. Rather he voiced general support for helping displaced workers. Indeed, Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger told us the TAA is ""ineffective and duplicative"" and in need of ""major reforms."" Johnson’s campaign also pointed to a House Budget Committee report that said the federal government has other forms of aid, including at least 35 job training programs among eight departments and agencies. There are ""dozens of programs to help people who need assistance,"" Reisinger said. Did Johnson vote to eliminate the Trade Adjustment Assistance program? Johnson voted in September 2011 against a bill to reauthorize the program, although the measure passed despite his opposition. Feingold also noted that Johnson voted at least once against providing three-year grants to technical colleges to train displaced workers eligible for TAA help. Those grants were part of the 2009 economic stimulus package, which was approved before Johnson was in office. But Johnson voted for legislation in 2011 that would have reduced TAA spending to pre-2009 levels; that proposal also failed. At the time, U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said he offered the measure because of concerns with TAA’s effectiveness and because stimulus spending was supposed to be temporary. Our rating Feingold said Johnson had referred to the Trade Adjustment Assistance program to defend his position on trade agreements — but had voted against the TAA. However, Johnson referred only generally to worker ""protections,"" not to the TAA specifically. He did vote against reauthorizing the program in 2011 and also voted around the same time to pare down funding, which would have had the effect of cutting a career training program. Our definition for Mostly False is ""The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.",/factchecks/2016/jul/06/russ-feingold/testing-russ-feingold-claim-about-opponent-ron-joh/
