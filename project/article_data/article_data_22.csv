Tax code offers write-offs for some private plane purchases
","A tweet from a New York congressional candidate contrasting federal tax write-offs available to teachers with write-offs available to people who can buy private jets spread quickly, garnering 23,500 retweets and 91,700 likes.  ""Teachers can only deduct up to $250 for school supplies on their taxes, but billionaires can write off the entire cost of a private jet,"" wrote Melanie D’Arrigo, a Democrat from Long Island running in the 3rd Congressional District. ""This is what it looks like when laws are written by millionaires, funded by billionaires. Unrig the system. Elect a working class Congress."" Are the facts in D’Arrigo’s tweet about the deductions - seen by her as an inequity in the tax code - correct?  Teachers are allowed to deduct $250 for supplies they purchase out-of-pocket for use in the classroom, even if they don’t itemize deductions, according to the Internal Revenue Service. In the 2022 tax year, that figure increases to $300.  As for private jets, the tax code allows for deduction of the full cost of a private aircraft, new or used, if used predominantly for business. However, the deduction provided for in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 is subject to complicated rules and penalties.  The cost of purchasing a private plane can be deducted by a business that owns the plane, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute. If the plane is used only for business purposes, it can be expensed or written off in the year that it is acquired, Gleckman said. If the plane is used for both business and personal uses, it generally can be written off over a period of years. If it has only personal uses, there is no write-off, experts said. Lawyers at the New York City-based firm Pillsbury who counsel high net-worth families warn that the rules are strict and complex. ""Given the complexity of the rules and the dollar amounts at stake, in the year of acquisition the aircraft should not be used for any personal, non-business use and, to the greatest extent possible, the taxpayer should avoid any possible entertainment or commuting use.""  Erica York, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit that supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and prefers a simpler tax code, told us that costs of doing business, such as physical assets with a useful life of 20 years or less, like an aircraft, can be deducted in the year the purchase occurs, but they are subject to complicated rules.  The aircraft must be used predominantly for business use in any taxable year, and there are regulations on entertainment use as well as penalties and what are known as recapture provisions if the requirements around business use are not met, York said. When the business sells the aircraft, it would owe depreciation recapture taxes at ordinary tax rates on the gain from selling the asset, she said.  The D’Arrigo campaign declined to comment on the record.  D’Arrigo said teachers can deduct up to $250 for school supplies on their taxes, but billionaires can write off the entire cost of a private jet. The deduction for teachers who pay for classroom expenses with their own money is currently $250.  Billionaires, or others who can afford a private jet, can write off the entire cost of an airplane in a single year, though the aircraft must be used for business purposes.  But not every billionaire’s purchase of a private airplane would qualify for a deduction under IRS rules.  We rate this claim Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2022/feb/18/melanie-darrigo/tax-code-offers-write-offs-some-private-plane-purc/

Yes, most Virginia schools are over 50 years old
","State Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, is leading a bipartisan effort this winter to raise money to repair and replace Virginia’s aging school buildings. Studies have shown ""more than half of Virginia’s school buildings are older than 50 years,"" she and Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, wrote in a Feb. 15 guest column published in The Roanoke Times. We wondered whether the figure is correct, particularly in the wake of a Feb. 11 fire that gutted Richmond’s 111-year-old William Fox Elementary School. An advisor to McClellan pointed us to a June 2021 report the Virginia Department of Education gave to a legislative commission studying the conditions of the state’s school buildings. ""More than half of all school buildings are greater than 50 years old,"" the report said, using almost the same words as the guest column. The report surveyed 2,005 school buildings across the state and found 1,017 of them - or 52% - were at least 50 years old as of June 2021. The median, or middle, age was 52. Here are percentages of local schools at least 50 years old: Chesterfield, 38%; Hanover, 48%; Henrico, 64%; Richmond, 72%. McClellan says the state and localities are falling behind on renovating and replacing old schools and, without change, the problem will worsen. She’s proposed a number of bills that would raise more money for modernization. The measures include: Allowing all localities in Virginia to impose a 1% increase in their sales tax, subject to voter approval, for school construction or renovation. Only nine localities are now granted that option; Letting local school systems set aside operating budget surpluses for school construction; Lowering the interest rates on state loans to localities for school construction and upgrades; and Expanding state aid for school building projects.  Her bills easily passed in the Democratic-led Senate with bipartisan support. But identical measures have been killed in the Appropriations Committee of the Republican-led House. It’s unclear whether there will be any movement in the House, where the majority has been focused on Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s agenda of cutting taxes.   We should finally note that problems with aging school buildings are not confined to Virginia. In June 2020, the U.S. Government and Accountability Office reported that about half of the nation’s public school districts need to replace multiple building systems or features. The average age of U.S. school buildings was 44 in 2013, according to the most recent survey by the National Center for Education Statistics.  McClellan writes, ""More than half of Virginia’s school buildings are older than 50 years."" State Department of Education records show 52% of Virginia schools had crossed the half-century mark in June 2021. We rate McClellan’s claim True.  ",/factchecks/2022/feb/18/jennifer-mcclellan/yes-most-virginia-schools-are-over-50-years-old/

Studies included on list do not question COVID-19 vaccine safety
","An Australian blog touting ""medical freedom"" published a misleading list about COVID-19 vaccine safety. The headline on the Jan. 20 list reads, ""1,000 peer reviewed studies questioning COVID-19 vaccine safety."" The list was shared on Facebook and flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It was published on Informed Choice Australia, which describes itself as ""a portal of information to help you make the right choice,"" and says people have the right ""to refuse any treatment that has not completed all the required clinical trials including long-term studies."" Far from ""questioning COVID-19 vaccine safety,"" as the claim says, many studies included in this catalog clearly state that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the small risk of side effects, which are rare. The studies collect, interpret and evaluate data about adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines, per the process with scientific research.  The list is grouped by adverse reaction categories, with myocarditis — inflammation of the heart muscle — topping the list and 226 related studies cited for that category. The risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 vaccines is small and symptoms are normally mild. By comparison, contracting COVID-19 is ""a strong and significant risk factor for myocarditis,"" especially among children under 16 years old, according to the CDC. The very first study on the list, which examined four patients with myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination, says, ""The authors seek not to frustrate vaccination efforts, but rather to prepare patients and providers for a rare but potential adverse effect."" Among the first 10 studies listed, nearly every one included similar language. One of the studies put it like this: ""Cases tend to be mild, do not usually require specific interventions, and potential risks of the vaccine are outweighed by the well defined risks of COVID-19 infection."" For other adverse reaction categories, the list again pointed to studies that did not question the safety of COVID-19 vaccines:  For cerebral venous thrombosis, a blood clot in the brain, one of the studies cited says the frequency of that reaction after COVID-19 vaccination is ""markedly lower"" than for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. For anaphylaxis, an allergic reaction that causes airways to narrow and block breathing, one of the studies said, ""The risk of anaphylaxis to mRNA vaccines is present but extremely low and is offset by the benefits of the vaccine."" The blog says it includes 1,000 studies, but some studies appear more than once, under different adverse reaction categories. For example, one study is found under both the anaphylaxis and allergic reactions categories, and multiple studies appear under both myocarditis and pericarditis subcategories. One adverse reaction that’s listed, called Sweet’s syndrome — a painful rash — cites a single study of one person. A list published on a blog has a headline that says, ""1,000 peer reviewed studies questioning COVID-19 vaccine safety."" Many studies included on the list clearly state that the benefits of vaccination against COVID-19 far outweigh the small risk of side effects, which are rare.

Claim that Canada imposed martial law is false
","The Emergencies Act invoked in Canada to quell protests gives specific powers to the federal government, police and banks, but one social media claim says it goes much further. ""Trudeau declares Emergencies Act amounting to near martial law in Canada,"" says the caption on a Feb. 14 video posted on Facebook. The caption continues, ""One of the powers is they can immediately seize anyone’s bank account funds without any redress."" The video is footage of Trudeau, who says, ""The federal government has invoked the Emergencies Act, to supplement provincial and territorial capacity to address the blockades and occupations."" The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) For this check, we’re looking specifically at the claim that Trudeau’s move is tantamount to martial law. Typically, martial law refers to temporary rule by military authorities and involves the suspension of civil rights. Trudeau said he will not call in the military as part of the Emergencies Act. Canada’s Emergencies Act is being used because of a public order emergency, to deal with blockades of downtown Ottawa and border crossings in several Canadian cities by people protesting COVID-19 restrictions and mandates. The law will be used to ""strengthen police powers to impose fines and imprison people; compel tow-truck companies to help clear blockades; allow banks to freeze the personal and corporate accounts of individual protesters without a court order; and subject crowdfunding companies to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules,"" the Toronto Globe and Mail reported. During a press conference, Trudeau said he wanted to be equally clear about what the Emergencies Act does not do. ""We’re not using the Emergencies Act to call in the military. We’re not suspending fundamental rights or overriding the Charter of Rights and Freedoms,"" he said on Feb. 14, referring to a part of Canada’s Constitution. In previous comments on Feb. 11, Trudeau said that ""using military forces against civilian populations in Canada or in any other democracy is something to avoid having to do at all costs."" The role of the military is not specifically addressed in the Emergencies Act, according to reporting by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. Other federal laws such as the National Defence Act would allow Canadian Armed Forces to assist in civil situations if needed, CBC reported. Under the Emergencies Act, banks can temporarily freeze accounts being used to support blockades without obtaining a court order. ""Banks are likely to focus on specific organizations suspected of coordinating the blockades and accounts receiving donations in large amounts,"" the Globe and Mail reported. ""Accounts belonging to individual donors are not expected to be a key focus of the financial crackdown."" The caption on a Facebook video says, ""Trudeau declares Emergencies Act amounting to near martial law in Canada."" Under the Emergencies Act, banks can temporarily freeze accounts being used to support protesters’ blockades without obtaining a court order. But the act doesn’t specify a role for the military. Trudeau has said he will not call in the military as part of the Emergencies Act. He also said fundamental rights will not be suspended.

No link between Moderna CEO’s deleted Twitter and stock sales
","A social media post erroneously suggested that there is a link between Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel’s Twitter activity and his stock trading.

""Big Pharma seems to know some bad news is coming."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Bancel did delete his personal Twitter account (@sbancel) in February and has sold a substantial amount of Moderna stock in recent years, but the post ignores important context about the timing and circumstances of the sales, and leaves a misleading impression about the reasons behind them. Bancel, whose compensation has included salary and stock options, has been regularly selling Moderna shares since September 2019. Over the last two and a half years, he has sold about $400 million worth of company stock in regularly scheduled trades, according to a website that tracks trading by company insiders. The transactions are in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules that allow company insiders to sell stock at predetermined dates. Doing so helps executives avoid any appearance or suspicion of illegal insider trading — that is, trading based on inside information that’s not available to the public. According to the February SEC filings, Bancel’s trading plan was adopted in December 2018, around the time the company went public, and was last modified in May 2020. So the post’s claim that he ""dumped"" $400 million in connection with some bad news is inaccurate. Bancel’s sales in February were in line with his trading plan. On Feb. 2, Bancel sold 19,000 shares of Moderna stock, worth $3.1 million, according to an SEC filing. A week later, on Feb. 9, Bancel sold another 19,000 shares, worth just under $3 million, per an SEC filing. The two transactions amounted to $6.1 million and represented only a small fraction of Bancel’s holdings. He still owns 21.8 million shares of Moderna stock, a company spokesperson told PolitiFact. Moderna’s stock price is well off its peak in August 2021, when it traded at nearly $500 a share. Its recent closing prices have been about a third of that. Bancel deleted his personal Twitter account earlier this month. It’s not clear why he did so, but Bancel was not very active on Twitter. His last tweets were from April 2019, according to a November 2021 archived version of his account. An Instagram post claimed, ""The CEO of Moderna deleted his Twitter and dumped $400 million of Moderna stock"" and suggested that the moves were due to impending bad news about the company. Bancel deleted his rarely used Twitter account, but there is no evidence to suggest that action is linked to his stock trades or bad news about the company. He did not ""dump"" $400 million of stock. His stock sales happened over more than two years, as part of a series of regularly scheduled trades. The most recent sales amounted to $6.1 million. He still owns 21.8 million shares of Moderna stock. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2022/feb/17/instagram-posts/no-link-between-moderna-ceos-deleted-twitter-and-s/

FDA didn’t say Pfizer misled them about vaccine safety. The statement came from a public commenter
","The U.S. Food & Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee routinely holds virtual meetings to give guidance and make recommendations on the COVID-19 vaccines. The meetings are streamed live, and members of the public can participate during an open comment period. But sometimes those comments can be a source of misinformation that spreads on social media. That’s what happened in this Instagram post, which appears to feature a screenshot of the Sept. 17, 2021, meeting’s livestream and incorrectly attributes a criticism of the vaccines to the FDA. Text along the top reads: ""FDA in their virtual meeting yesterday: ‘We were falsely misled by (Pfizer) about the safety of the vaccine … heart attacks are 71x higher than other vaccines ... the vaccines are killing two people for every one life saved’ listen from the 4 hr 20 mark."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The FDA did not say this, and the agency strongly disputed the substance of the statement.  The statements were made during the meeting’s public comment session by Steve Kirsch, a tech entrepreneur who founded the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund, which aims to fund research on existing drugs to treat COVID-19.  Kirsch began promoting unproven COVID-19 drugs and campaigning against the vaccines as the pandemic progressed, Technology Review reported, and many of his professional associates have distanced themselves from him, with all 12 board members of the Early Treatment Fund resigning in May. The organization’s website is full of misinformation about the vaccines.  ""Steve Kirsch is not, and has never been, employed by the FDA and is not a member of FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee,"" FDA spokesperson Abby Capobianco told PolitiFact in an email.  Capobianco said that Kirsch asked to speak at the public hearing portion of the meeting, which is open to anyone who signs up. The FDA does not screen remarks from speakers in advance. She added that the statements made by Kirsch were ""not based in science"" and ""go against FDA’s public health mission."" About four hours into the meeting, Kirsch claimed that the COVID-19 vaccine ""kills more people than it saves,"" among other false statements.  Kirsch said he based his comments on data from the federal government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. The FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which jointly run VAERS, specifically warn that its reports cannot be relied on alone to make conclusions about whether a vaccine causes a particular side effect. Rather, it’s intended to help researchers detect patterns that may warrant further study. Unlike other official government data sources that are screened by statisticians and analysts before being made available to the public, VAERS is an open-access system. It’s designed so that anyone — parents, patients and health care professionals — can freely report any health effects that might occur after a vaccination, whether or not those effects are believed to be caused by the vaccine.  The reports aren’t verified before they’re entered and have included car accidents and incidents of self injury among reported adverse events following vaccination. Still, anyone with a computer can search the data, download it, and interpret the numbers as they wish — making VAERS fertile ground for vaccine misinformation. So Kirsch’s use of VAERS reports to draw conclusions about the vaccines was problematic. ""The FDA strongly disagrees with the analysis Mr. Kirsch put forth during the VRBPAC meeting, as we believe the data from VAERS that he referenced were not properly interpreted,’ Capobianco said. ""This is due to the limitations of VAERS itself, as well as the limitations regarding certain private patient information that is not available to individuals outside of FDA and CDC."" The approved COVID-19 vaccines have met rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality, and reports of deaths are rare. More than 543 million doses have been administered in the U.S. from Dec. 14, 2020, through Feb. 3, 2022, according to the FDA. During this time, VAERS received 12,122 reports of death (0.0022%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. That includes people who died of any cause. The FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause, Capobianco said. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, don’t necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem, she said, and a review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, hasn’t established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines. An Instagram post claims that the FDA said in a vaccine advisory meeting that Pfizer ""falsely misled"" the agency about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines and that the shots are killing more people than they save. This is inaccurate. No one affiliated with the FDA said this, and the agency strongly disputed the substance of the statements.  The comments were made by Steve Kirsch, a tech entrepreneur who has promoted unproven COVID-19 drugs and misinformation about the vaccines in the past. He based his claims on VAERS, which contains unverified reports and cannot be used alone to draw conclusions about vaccine safety.

Racine is seeking to have the money paid back and redistributed to charities. In November 2021, D.C. Superior Court Judge José M. López threw out part of the lawsuit, but left in the allegation that ""the nonprofit inaugural committee had misused assets for the Trump family’s private gain,"" the Washington Post reported, allowing the lawsuit to move forward. He also dismissed the Trump Organization as a defendant, ruling that the district did not have jurisdiction.  The case was later transferred to a new judge, Yvonne Williams, who on Feb. 14 ruled that López’s decision to drop the Trump Organization as a defendant was ""erroneous.""  Racine celebrated the judge’s ruling, on Twitter, writing that the lawsuit is ""moving forward fully intact"" and is ""going to trial.""

Jesse Watters spins facts beyond recognition with claims Hillary Clinton paid to hack, frame Trump
","Fox News host Jesse Watters falsely accused Hillary Clinton of paying hackers to break into former President Donald Trump’s computers and plant fabricated evidence that would frame Trump for collusion with the Russian government.  The elaborate scheme Watters described is a massive distortion of a Feb. 11 court filing that has attracted attention from conservative media in the week after it dropped. The filing came from special counsel John Durham, selected by former Trump Attorney General William Barr to examine the reasons for the Justice Department’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Special counsel Robert Mueller led the initial investigation that culminated in a report published in 2019.  Watters claimed Durham’s work now implicates Clinton.   ""If there was ever any doubt that Clinton was behind the Russia hoax, that’s officially gone,"" Watters said on his primetime show Feb. 14. ""Durham’s documents show that Hillary Clinton hired people who hacked into Trump’s home and office computers before and during his presidency, and planted evidence that he colluded with Russia. Yeah. You heard that right."" ""Hillary broke into a presidential candidate's computer server and a sitting president's computer server, spying on them,"" he went on. ""There, her hackers planted evidence, fabricated evidence connecting Trump to Russia, then fed that doctored material to the feds and the media."" None of what Watters said on that program about an effort to hack and frame Trump with fake evidence is borne out by Durham’s filing, which he cited. The document never even mentioned hacking. Still, the narrative echoed elsewhere on Fox News, where talk of hacking and an offense ""worse than Watergate"" stretched across programs, according to TVEyes, a media monitoring service. One of the first headlines posted to Fox News’s website inaccurately declared that the Clinton campaign paid to ""infiltrate"" Trump’s servers. The word ""infiltrate"" was never used in Durham’s filing. Rather, the Fox News article was using words from a former Trump administration official who commented for the story.  On air, Sean Hannity claimed Clinton’s team ""hacked into the office of the president."" Tucker Carlson said emails or text messages were ""intercepted."" Maria Bartiromo insisted that ""Democrat-paid operatives illegally hacked"" Trump’s communications before and after he became president. As Watters blasted Clinton on his primetime show, sensational chyrons decorated the screen: ""Durham: Clinton Framed Trump""; ""Crooked Caught Red Handed""; ""Hillary Is The Real Insurrectionist.""  The chyrons on ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" on Feb. 14 focused on Hillary Clinton and special counsel John Durham's investigation.  A video Watters posted of his segment ricocheted across Facebook, where it received hundreds of thousands of views and was flagged as part of the platform’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Here’s what really happened. Back in October 2020, Barr tapped Durham, a Justice Department attorney, to lead an investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation that led to the Mueller report.  John Durham speaks to reporters on the steps of U.S. District Court in New Haven, Conn., on April 25, 2006. (AP) In the 16 months since then, Durham has filed two indictments. Both are on charges of making false statements to the FBI.  The filing that created the latest stir was a motion in Durham’s case against Michael Sussmann. Sussmann worked as an attorney at Perkins Coie, a law firm that did work for Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. In 2015, he was separately retained by another client, a technology executive, according to the September 2021 indictment against him. Reporters later revealed the executive to be Rodney Joffe, an internet entrepreneur and cybersecurity expert. According to Sussmann’s indictment, he met with the FBI in 2016 and passed along data that cybersecurity researchers working with Joffe had flagged as potential evidence of a secret backdoor communications channel between the Trump Organization and a Kremlin-linked bank. ""Sussmann stated falsely that he was not doing his work on the aforementioned allegations ‘for any client,’ which led the FBI General Counsel to understand that Sussmann was acting as a good citizen merely passing along information, not as a paid advocate or political operative,"" the indictment said. The indictment said he was actually there on behalf of the Clinton campaign and Joffe.  Sussmann has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. Joffe has not been charged with any criminal activity in the matter — nor has Clinton. Durham’s latest filing in the case against Sussmann was a 13-page motion related to a conflict-of-interest matter. And though it had some new details, it was mostly information that was listed in Sussmann’s indictment or previously reported. But supporters of Trump latched onto the filing’s description of another meeting Sussmann had with the CIA in 2017. During that meeting, the filing said, Sussmann relayed suspicions over information Joffe and researchers had gathered while sifting through internet traffic data that showed domain name lookups. The information was said to have shown Russian-made phones used from networks serving Trump Tower and the White House, among other locations. The data the researchers were parsing through was domain name system, or DNS, data. That data shows the IP addresses a computer is visiting. It is typically non-public or proprietary, but it’s regularly studied and monitored by private contractors and government agencies for the purpose of filtering out suspicious traffic, malware and dangerous websites.  That information would not reveal the contents of a person’s screen or messages, only that one computer was trying to communicate with another, said Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, in a Twitter thread. Joffe’s company at the time had legal access to the data because it was providing services for the White House, the filing said. A spokesperson for Joffe told NBC News that according to the contract, the ""data could be accessed to identify and analyze any security breaches or threats,"" and that the findings Sussmann shared reflected concerns about anomalies in the data. Durham’s filing said that Joffe and his team ""exploited this arrangement by mining the (executive office of the president’s) DNS traffic and other data for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump.""  Then-candidate Donald Trump speaks during a presidential debate with Hillary Clinton at Washington University in St. Louis on Oct. 9, 2016. (AP) ""The allegations are that the defendant gained access to internet traffic information from a third party, and that he used this information as evidence to support a false claim that Trump and/or his associates were using a certain type of phone,"" said Ric Simmons, a law professor at the Ohio State University and an expert on computer crime, who reviewed the filing for PolitiFact.  The allegations have not yet been proven in trial.  Watters cast Durham’s allegations into something more sinister: a plot, supposedly hatched and paid for by Clinton and carried out throughout Trump’s presidency, that involved hacking his computers and planting falsified evidence linking him to Russia.  Fox News did not respond to a request for comment asking where in his filing Durham accused Clinton or her campaign of all that Watters said he did. Durham’s filing never claimed that Clinton paid Joffe. And it never accused anyone of ""hacking,"" a term that Simmons said generally refers to the act of breaking into a computer system without authorization, a federal crime.  Special Counsel John Durham's Feb. 11 filing in the case against Michael Sussmann drew outsized media attention. ""Neither Joffe nor the (researchers he worked with) were being paid by the Clinton campaign,"" Sanchez tweeted. ""Nobody ‘hacked’ or ‘intercepted’ anything. They were analyzing data they had lawful access to, in order to look for suspicious patterns that might suggest foreign cyberattacks."" ""This is not the same as alleging he broke into a system,"" Simmons said. Durham’s motion also said nothing about Watters’ claim that Clinton-backed hackers placed falsified evidence on Trump’s servers to frame him for collusion with Russia. ""I have no idea where this statement comes from,"" Simmons said. ""The allegations in the document never mention planting evidence on a server or altering the information on the server in any way."" Then there’s the issue of timing. Durham’s filing never said that the DNS data in question was captured while Trump was president, as Watters and other conservative media members have claimed. The indictment Durham lodged against Sussmann said that the data Sussmann shared with the CIA in 2017 ranged ""from 2016 through early 2017."" Attorneys for one of the researchers who worked with Joffe told the New York Times that the claims about spying on Trump during his presidency are wrong: ""The cybersecurity researchers were investigating malware in the White House, not spying on the Trump campaign, and to our knowledge all of the data they used was non-private DNS data from before Trump took office."" In a response to Durham’s motion, Sussmann’s lawyers said the same. The data Sussmann shared with the CIA ""pertained only to the period of time before Mr. Trump took office, when Barack Obama was president,"" they wrote. The lawyers also said ""the Clinton campaign had effectively ceased to exist"" by the time of the meeting and was not billed for it. ""​​The coverage from right-wing media is a technically illiterate conspiracy corkboard covered in yarn, and the mainstream coverage thus far has mostly been about pointing out why that’s silly and wrong,"" Sanchez said of the Durham filing in his Twitter thread. On Watters’ claim about it, he wrote: ""Every part of that is a preposterous lie."" Watters said, ""Durham’s documents show that Hillary Clinton hired people who hacked into Trump’s home and office computers before and during his presidency, and planted evidence that he colluded with Russia ... fabricated evidence connecting Trump to Russia."" None of that is backed up by Durham’s filing, a motion over a conflict-of-interest matter in the case against an attorney linked to the Clinton campaign who was charged for lying to the FBI.  We rate Watters’ claim False.",/factchecks/2022/feb/17/jesse-watters/jesse-watters-spins-facts-beyond-recognition-claim/

NC Democrats target Republicans but leave out context
","Some North Carolina Democrats say gerrymandering efforts were ""worse"" in the state Senate than in the state House, in part because two Republican senators didn’t testify during a recent redistricting trial. North Carolina legislators redraw the state voting maps every decade after new census data come out. The political party in power typically draws the districts to favor themselves, often  prompting lawsuits from critics. That happened again last year. Voting rights groups sued leaders in the Republican-led state House and state Senate, arguing their maps are unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. A panel of Superior Court judges ruled in favor of the Republicans. So the plaintiffs then appealed to the state Supreme Court. On Jan. 31, ahead of oral arguments before the high court, the North Carolina House Democrats’ Twitter account tweeted: House Republicans ""admitted to secret maps and destruction of evidence,"" but Sens. Paul Newton and Warren Daniel ""refused to even give testimony. So the question is—what the hell was going on in the [state Senate] that was so much worse than what was happening in the House?"" Republicans refuted the tweet. Senate Leader Phil Berger’s communications team called the Democrats’ claim ""evidence-free conspiracy theorizing."" There’s a lot to unpack in this tweet, which takes some facts from the redistricting case and frames them in a way that could lead some to think the lawmakers engaged in wrongdoing. First, a portion of the House Democrats’ claim about secret maps is accurate but some of it is difficult to prove. During the lower-court trial, Republican state Rep. Destin Hall said he and his staffers consulted secret ""concept"" maps while leading the chamber’s restricting process. He said the maps didn’t incorporate any racial or partisan gerrymanders. But it’s unclear whether the maps were intentionally destroyed. The defendants, in court documents, said only that the maps were ""were not saved, are currently lost and no longer exist."" While that may raise questions about records retention, it doesn’t prove that the maps were intentionally destroyed. The state Supreme Court overturned the maps on Feb. 4, and ten days later cited the concept maps in its full opinion.   One reason the N.C. House Democrats’ tweet stands out: the secret maps were on the House side—but the tweet makes claims about the Senate. As for Daniel and Newton testifying, it’s true that they declined to answer questions in a deposition. But it’s misleading to suggest their silence is indicative of wrongdoing, since they asked the court for—and were granted—protections offered by state laws. The tweet also could give some readers the impression that senate Republicans didn’t answer questions at all. That’s not the case. Sen. Ralph Hise, the highest-ranking co-chairman of the state Senate’s redistricting committee, was deposed and later testified on the third day of the Superior Court trial. Let’s review the facts. The N.C. House Democrats’ Twitter account is run by the Democratic Party’s state House caucus.  Amanda Eubanks, the caucus executive director, told PolitiFact NC the ""refused to testify"" claim is a reference to Daniel and Newton invoking ""legislative privilege,"" a state law that can protect legislators from having to provide information about some aspects of the lawmaking process.  Before the redistricting trial, plaintiffs sought to depose Daniel, Newton, Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore, also a Republican. Those lawmakers cited legislative privilege and asked to be exempt from the depositions, a motion the court granted on Dec. 24. Once Daniel and Newton were exempted from depositions, they were viewed as ineligible to testify on the stand. So even if they wanted to testify in the trial, it’s unlikely that they would have been called upon.  That said, the scope of legislative privilege is not well defined in state law. So, in a hypothetical case in which a legislator seeks to avoid questioning, a judge could compel a legislator to answer questions about details that aren’t protected by legislative immunity, lawyers told PolitiFact NC. ""There are some things in public records like communications between legislators and legislative staff, or when they go to the research group and say, ‘If I propose this, is it legal?’ You’re not going to get it because it’s confidential,"" said Mike Tadych, a partner at law firm Stevens Martin Vaughn & Tadych PLLC, which represents the North Carolina Press Association. But in a trial, you typically ""can’t just assert legislative privilege because you’re a legislator and you don’t want to talk,"" said Kym Hunter, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. ""Legislative privilege could apply potentially to certain parts of what they would be questioned about, but there’s certainly many, many aspects which wouldn't be subject to legislative privilege."" Voting rights group Common Cause, a plaintiff in the case, included Berger and Daniel on its witness list filing on Dec. 31—after the senators had already been granted legislative privilege. Common Cause didn’t call upon either senator during trial, but in court documents the group said it ""reserves the right to challenge legislative privilege on appeal."" The N.C. House Democrats’ tweet implies that silence by Daniel and Newton is indicative that the Senate’s behavior was somehow ""worse"" than that of Republicans in the House.  The accusation is vague and hard to quantify without more information about what action is being measured. When it comes to alleged gerrymandering, none of the three maps drawn by Republican lawmakers stand out as being significantly more partisan than the others. Experts at Princeton University reviewed the state House, state Senate and the congressional maps, giving each an ""F"" grade, due to ""significant Republican advantage.""  We asked Eubanks what N.C. House Democrats meant by the statement, and she never directly answered the question. Hise, meanwhile, testified that the state Senate and House redistricting processes were ""very different."" Hise noted that he, Daniel and Newton used the same staff assistance provided by Berger’s office. He said he wasn’t aware of any secret maps being used on the Senate side because all maps were required to be drawn in public view. Hise acknowledged that he never issued a specific directive banning staff from looking at concept maps outside of public view—something state Supreme Court justices noted in their recent opinion—but he said aides were aware of the rules. While the N.C. House Democrats’ tweet raises questions about the senate process, Berger spokeswoman Lauren Horsch noted that Hise’s testimony wasn’t disputed in court. She added that Hise testified—and the others didn’t—in part because the trial was under time constraints. The N.C. House Democrats’ Twitter account said Newton and Daniel ""refused to even give testimony"" in North Carolina’s redistricting case. ""So the question is—what the hell was going on in the [state Senate] that was so much worse than what was happening in the House?"" It’s true that they did not give testimony. But that’s because the senators invoked a legal protection called ""legislative privilege"" that allowed them to opt out of answering questions in the case. That move alone doesn’t necessarily mean they have something to hide.  The tweet is partially accurate but leaves out important details, which is our definition of Half True.",/factchecks/2022/feb/17/north-carolina-state-house-democratic-caucus/nc-democrats-target-republicans-leave-out-context/

No, you cannot be vaccinated against COVID-19 by a PCR test

""Johns Hopkins University confirms: You can be vaccinated with a PCR test, even without knowing,"" read the headline of a newsletter being shared on Facebook. The newsletter went on to claim that the push for widespread PCR COVID-19 testing might be ""a WHO vaccination program in disguise."" It alleged that new technology developed at Johns Hopkins University ""is supposed to make it possible to carry out covert vaccinations through a PCR test.""  Posts sharing the newsletter were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that researchers affiliated with Johns Hopkins University have said people can be vaccinated with a PCR test.  A polymerase chain reaction — or PCR — COVID-19 test detects genetic material from the virus, according to the Cleveland Clinic. To conduct a PCR test, a swab is used to collect a sample of the respiratory material found in a person’s nose. The sample is then tested for coronavirus genetic material. The newsletter falsely suggested that tiny devices developed by Johns Hopkins researchers known as ""theragrippers"" can be added to the PCR test swabs to vaccinate a person without their knowledge. Theragrippers actually exist, but there is no evidence they’re being used for ""covert vaccinations,"" and they’re not administered by cotton swabs, as the newsletter suggests. The newsletter points to a November 2020 Johns Hopkins article that said that researchers had designed and tested ""tiny, star-shaped microdevices that can latch onto intestinal mucosa and release drugs into the body.""  A spokesperson for Johns Hopkins Medicine said articles about the research have been ""inaccurately used for disinformation purposes"" in recent months.  ""The article described small devices known as ‘theragrippers’ that are deployed to the intestines via an endoscope,"" the spokesperson said. ""When these dust-sized devices reach a certain temperature, they latch onto tissue and release the medicine that has been loaded onto them.""  Research into how the devices might be used to improve gastrointestinal tract extended-release drug delivery was published in the journal Science Advances in October 2020.  ""The researchers demonstrated that the theragrippers were capable of clinging to the GI tracts of live rats for 24 hours"" and found that the devices helped a pain reliever ""remain in the body for a substantially longer period of time,"" according to Science Advances. The research found that ""self-latching microdevices enhance the efficacy of extended drug delivery.""  The newsletter highlights the role of swabs, suggesting that PCR swabs with theragrippers could vaccinate people without their knowledge. But theragrippers are not administered via such swabs. ""Theragrippers can be endoscopically deployed in the GI tract,"" explained an article Johns Hopkins Medicine released in February 2021. The newsletter misleadingly relies on a photo from the original November 2020 Johns Hopkins article. To emphasize the small size of the technology, the university featured an image of a swab dotted with black specks.  ""A theragripper is about the size of a speck of dust,"" the photo caption said. ""This swab contains dozens of the tiny devices."" The Johns Hopkins Medicine spokesperson said that the theragrippers have ""shown promise in a laboratory setting,"" but the technology is still in the early stages and has not been approved for use in humans.

"['North Carolina', 'Barbara Gaskins']","
NC Democrat falsely says state GOP supports controversial Scott plan
","A North Carolina congressional candidate says the state’s Republican Party wants to raise taxes through what it characterized as ""extremist"" legislation proposed in the U.S. Senate. Barbara Gaskins is a Democrat running against U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy in North Carolina’s 3rd Congressional District, which covers a large swath of the state’s coastline. On May 24, Gaskins’ campaign tweeted: ""The N.C. GOP came out in support of Sen. Scott's extremist policy to ‘Rescue America,"" the post said, referring to Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.).  It added that the plan would raise taxes on 40% of the state’s working class, dissolve Social Security and Medicare benefits after five years, close the U.S. Department of Education and enforce identification requirements for voting. The tweet stood out to PolitiFact North Carolina because the North Carolina Republican Party organization doesn’t regularly promote or endorse bills proposed at the federal level — especially those introduced by lawmakers from other states. And Scott’s bill is controversial, having been rebuked by GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. So, does the North Carolina Republican Party endorse Scott’s so-called Rescue America plan? No.  Here are the key points of Scott’s bill and why the Democrats are trying to tie Republicans to it. Scott is chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which campaigns to elect Republican candidates to the Senate. On Feb. 22, he released what he calls ""An 11-point plan to rescue America."" The plan called for taxing all Americans and requiring a vote to continue all federal programs, a proposal that Republican leaders have opposed. So, Republican candidates have distanced themselves from it.  McConnell said in a press conference that Senate Republicans ""will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people, and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years."" Nonetheless, Democrats have tried to elevate it during campaign season as a sign of things to come if the GOP gains control of Congress in the November midterm elections. PolitiFact has reported on the plan and fact-checked multiple misleading claims about it. Here’s a brief explanation of the proposals mentioned in Gaskins’ tweet. A ""tax increase on 40% of N.C.'s working class."" Scott’s plan says ""all Americans should pay some income tax."" While Scott has denied that the plan calls for a tax increase, tax and policy experts previously told PolitiFact that Scott’s plan appears to target people who don’t owe any federal income tax because they don’t earn enough income.  Experts said about 60% of taxpayers fell into that group in 2020, but that the group would likely shrink to about 40% in 2022. The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimated Scott’s plan would affect 39.8% of North Carolina residents. ""Dissolve Social Security and Medicare benefits after five years."" Scott’s plan doesn’t specifically call for ending Social Security and Medicare, but says: ""All federal legislation sunsets in five years. If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again."" Sunsetting means programs would expire unless Congress votes to extend them. ""Close the (U.S. Department) of Education."" Scott’s plan specifically calls for dissolving the federal department of education. The plan says: ""We will close the federal Department of Education. Education is a state function. If Congress wants to spend money on education, they can cut out the middleman and send it directly to schools and parents."" ""Enforce ID for voting."" The plan says: ""Voter ID, requiring a voter to validate their identity, must be the law."" When we emailed Gaskins and asked her to provide evidence for her claim about the N.C. GOP, a campaign spokeswoman cited messaging from the North Carolina Democratic Party. Scott was a featured speaker during the state GOP’s annual convention in Greensboro, North Carolina, last month. In a May 23 press release, the Democratic Party said: ""By hosting Scott, North Carolina Republicans signed on to a plan that could raise taxes on nearly 40% of North Carolinians and sunset Social Security and Medicare, which over four million North Carolinians rely on."" Michael Whatley, the state GOP chairman, says that’s not true. He told PolitiFact NC that he was glad to have Scott speak because, as chair of the senatorial committee, Scott offers unique insight into how the GOP can retake Congress this fall. But that doesn’t mean the state party endorses his bill. ""We’re not going to endorse that,"" Whatley said in a phone interview. Donna Williams, chair of the Wake County GOP, attended the event and didn’t recall Scott mentioning his bill or its details. If Scott had mentioned a call to increase taxes, ""I would absolutely remember that,"" she said, saying it’s ""ridiculous for anyone to suggest that inviting someone to come speak implies an across-the-board blanket endorsement of whatever legislation they have."" Aside from Scott’s appearance at the North Carolina Republican Party convention, neither the party nor the Gaskins campaign provided any evidence that the organization had endorsed the Scott plan. In a phone interview, North Carolina Democratic Party spokeswoman Ellie Dougherty reiterated the claims from the email newsletter and said, ""We think it's pretty clear where they stand."" Gaskins tweeted that ""the N.C. GOP came out in support of Sen. (Rick) Scott's extremist policy to ‘Rescue America.’"" Scott did release a plan that indicates support for raising income taxes and sunsetting federal programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Even McConnell rebuked the ideas. However, there’s no evidence that the North Carolina Republican Party has come out in support of Scott’s plan.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2022/jun/07/barbara-gaskins/nc-democrat-falsely-says-state-gop-supports-contro/

Yes, a tax break Ron Johnson pushed for in 2017 has benefited America’s wealthiest more
","The general election for one of Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate seats may still be months away, but Democrats have been gearing up to defeat Ron Johnson for much longer.  Johnson, an Oshkosh Republican and Wisconsin’s senior senator, has held the seat since 2011. Earlier this year, he announced he’d break with his initial pledge to only serve two terms and run for a third. In a news release, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin honed in on an action Johnson took at the beginning of his second term: He withheld his yes vote on the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act unless the bill included a tax break for companies called ""pass-throughs"" — those that pass all their income on to the owners or investors. Companies structured this way (often small, family owned businesses) are not subject to corporate income tax. And it worked. Once that tax break was added, Johnson voted yes and the bill passed.  But Wisconsin Democrats argue it wasn’t those small, family-owned businesses that reaped the bulk of the benefits.  ""Multiple independent studies found that the tax carve out Johnson spearheaded overwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest, over small businesses,"" the April 29, 2022, release said. Is that correct? Let’s break it down.  When asked to back up the claim, Philip Shulman, Senate communications advisor for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, sent a list of analyses of the tax law from news outlets and research organizations.  We’ll start with an April 2021 study from Treasury economists for the National Bureau of Economic Research. The study found that the top 1% of Americans by income have received nearly 60% of the tax savings created by the provision. Most of that amount went to the top 0.1%.  That’s because even though there are many American small businesses that also function as pass-throughs, most pass-through profits flow to the wealthy owners of a small group of large companies, according to an Aug. 11, 2021, ProPublica analysis of the tax law.  That small group of the ultrawealthy — made up of Republicans like Dick and Liz Uihlein, whose shipping supply company Uline is headquartered in Wisconsin, and Democrats like former presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg — received close to $25 billion in total tax savings in 2018 as a result of the pass-through tax break benefits, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research study.  The rest of the top 10% of Americans by income received a little over $12 billion in total, and everyone else in the country, about $6 billion.  An April 23, 2018, congressional report forecast the same breakdown. In 2018, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that roughly 53% of the pass-through deduction benefit, or about $21 billion, would go to a few hundred thousand Americans earning $500,000 or more a year. For comparison, the average salary for an American small business owner is about $61,000 per year, according to the salary comparison company Payscale.  By 2024, just under $4 billion of the pass-through deduction benefit would go to Americans making less than $100,000 per year, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation Report. More than $31 billion would go to those making over a million dollars a year.  To be sure, any broad-based tax cut will mostly benefit the wealthy because they already pay a large share of income taxes, something Johnson has acknowledged.  In an April 28, 2022, interview with CBS 58-TV, Johnson said his efforts were ""for the many, not the few"" because most businesses function as pass-throughs, and that ""when you start talking about taxation, if you cut taxes for everybody … people who make more money get more dollars cut, but that’s our tax system."" The Democratic Party of Wisconsin claimed that the pass-through tax break Johnson advocated for in 2017 ""overwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest, over small businesses.""  Multiple analyses show America’s millionaires and billionaires are receiving large chunks of those benefits. We rate their claim True.   ",/factchecks/2022/jun/07/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/yes-tax-break-ron-johnson-pushed-2017-has-benefite/
"['North Carolina', 'National Republican Senatorial Committee']","
NRSC exaggerates effect of Beasley rulings in sex offense cases
","A national Republican group has launched a second attack ad that calls into question the judgment of North Carolina’s Democratic U.S. Senate candidate. Former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley is running for U.S. Senate against U.S. Rep. Ted Budd, R-N.C. Both candidates hope to replace Republican U.S. Sen. Richard Burr, who is retiring when his term ends this year. The National Republican Senatorial Committee recently released two ads accusing Beasley of failing victims of crime. In the first ad, the NRSC says Beasley ""vacated"" a man’s death sentence and ""threw out"" the indictment in a case with a 7-year-old girl. PolitiFact found that the ad omitted key context about the cases, rating its claims Half True. In its second ad, the NRSC recycled the claim that Beasley threw out the indictment in the girl’s assault case. Again, it leaves out that Beasley and a majority of the state Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors failed to comply with state law when indicting the man involved. The second ad highlights two other cases. Here’s a transcript of what the narrator says. ""Our children are society’s most vulnerable, and Chief Justice Cheri Beasley has failed them. ""A man seeking sex with a boy online? She tossed the conviction.  ""The predator who sexually assaulted a 7-year-old girl? Beasley threw out the indictment.  ""A child porn offender. She voted to set him free. ""And, sadly, there’s more.  ""We can’t trust Cheri Beasley to protect our families."" Several North Carolina television stations, including PolitiFact partner WRAL, recently decided to stop running the ad because they determined it contains false or misleading claims. The PolitiFact North Carolina team at WRAL separately reviewed the ad’s claims that Beasley ""tossed"" the conviction of a man seeking sex with a boy, and that she voted to set free a child porn offender. Using the PolitFact process, we found that those descriptions exaggerate the effect of the state Supreme Court’s rulings and omit important details about the cases that might give viewers a different impression of Beasley. PolitiFact reviewed the ad’s claims that Beasley ""tossed"" the conviction of a man seeking sex with a boy, and that she voted to set free a child porn offender. Those descriptions exaggerate the effect of the state Supreme Court’s rulings and omit important details about the cases that might give viewers a different impression of Beasley. Dory MacMillan, the communications director for Beasley’s campaign, called it a ""false attack.""  ""Voters know Cheri worked with law enforcement to hold violent offenders accountable, and she will continue to keep our communities safe as North Carolina’s next U.S. senator,"" MacMillan said.  In a June 3 press release, the NRSC defended the ad saying it accurately presents Beasley’s record. The ad’s claim about a man seeking sex with a boy online stems from the State of North Carolina v. David Alan Keller case that the state Supreme Court ruled on in 2020.  Keller had been convicted of soliciting a minor for sex in a case involving a detective in the Lincolnton Police Department who posed as a 15-year-old online. The detective posted a personal advertisement titled ""Boy Needs a Man"" on the ""casual encounters"" section of Craigslist and Keller responded the next day, court records show, writing in his initial post: ""I am a 44 white male looking for a young guy to take care of and spoil."" The detective told Keller that he needed a place to live. Keller offered to house him, and the detective said he’d agree only if they could also have sex: ""Just give me a yes or no."" Keller responded ""Yes."" In his trial, Keller testified that he believed he was communicating with an adult on Craigslist because its users must click a disclaimer stating that they are 18-years-old to access the ""casual encounters"" section of the website. Keller’s lawyer argued that the detective was the only person during the encounter to allude to the possibility of sexual activity during their conversations. Keller only agreed to meet him so that he wouldn’t ""find someone else"" for sexual activity because, he said, he was afraid the detective might be hurt by someone else. Keller testified that he responded to the ad because he and his live-in companion ""were having  problems"" and he wanted to make his partner ""jealous,"" according to court documents. He further testified that ""sex was not on my mind at this time."" Upon cross-examination, though, Keller admitted that his initial response to the Craigslist ad was ""sexual in nature,"" but that he thought the detective was 18. When the jury was instructed to deliberate the case, Keller’s attorney argued that the jury should be allowed to consider Keller’s entrapment defense. But the trial court denied that request. After the state’s Court of Appeals upheld the ruling, the case went to the North Carolina Supreme Court on March 9, 2020. By that point, state records show that Keller had already been released from prison after serving from September 29, 2016, to July 5, 2018.  On June 5, 2020, the state Supreme Court ruled 5-2 that Keller was entitled to a new trial. Beasley wrote the opinion, saying the case was prejudicial because the defendant ""presented substantial evidence that might allow a reasonable juror to find that it was [the detective], rather than defendant, who repeatedly demanded that defendant agree to participate in sexual activity."" The ad says Beasley ""tossed the conviction."" While the conviction was vacated, the ruling came down after Keller completed his time in prison and the conviction remains in state records. The Department of Public Safety must receive a court order in order to expunge someone’s record, a department spokesman said. The narrator in the NRSC ad said Beasley ""set free"" a child porn offender, while an image on the screen says the man was convicted on 12 counts. This claim refers to the State of North Carolina v. James Howard Terrell Jr. The question before the state Supreme Court in that case was not about Terrell’s actions, but about how local police obtained evidence used against him.  When Terrell was at work, his longtime girlfriend went into his briefcase and found a USB drive, commonly known as a thumb drive, and plugged it into their shared computer in an attempt to find a photo of Terrell’s former housekeeper. She then came across an image of her 9-year-old granddaughter sleeping in a bed and ""exposed from the waist up."" She then stopped looking through his USB drive and took it to the Onslow County Sheriff’s Department, according to court documents.  A detective discovered more photos of ""prepubescent females"" while attempting to find a photo of the girlfriend’s granddaughter on the USB drive. The detective then included information from his search of the USB drive in his application for a warrant, court records show. The defense argued that, if the warrant hadn’t been granted, 10 of the 12 photos found by the State Bureau of Investigation wouldn’t have been used against Terrell because they had been deleted and were only detected using the SBI’s ""forensic tool."" At trial, the defense motioned to suppress some of the evidence but was denied.  Upon appeal, the state Court of Appeals ruled that the detective’s search of the USB drive infringed upon his right to privacy.  The state Supreme Court later agreed, with Justice Anita Earls writing this opinion in response to prosecutors: ""We cannot agree that the mere opening of a thumb drive and the viewing of as little as one file automatically renders the entirety of the device’s contents ‘now nonprivate information. "" Beasley was among the majority who affirmed the appeals court decision. Paul Newby, the lone Republican justice at the time, was the only dissenter. The state Supreme Court’s ruling in his case garnered attention from the media and academic communities. The NRSC said Beasley set the offender free. Though the state Supreme Court affirmed the appeals court’s ruling, Terrell wasn’t immediately freed.  The state Supreme Court’s ruling was handed down on Aug. 16, 2019. Records show Terrell was incarcerated in November 2016 and released Dec. 23, 2021. The NRSC ad said Beasley tossed the conviction of a man ""seeking sex with a boy online."" It leaves out that the defendant argued that he was entrapped, a detail key to understanding how the case made it to the state Supreme Court. It also misleads people about the effects of Beasley’s ruling. By the time it was handed down, the defendant had already served his prison sentence. And the conviction still appears in state records. The NRSC ad said Beasley ""set free"" a child porn offender. In this case, the Court of Appeals had already ruled that officials violated the defendant’s right to privacy. The state Supreme Court’s ruling affirmed that decision. And after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the defendant remained in prison for another two years. The statement contains some elements of truth about the defendants in the cases but ignores critical facts that would give viewers a different impression of the subject matter and why Beasley ruled the way she did.

Deer licenses sold in Wisconsin don't prove the state has one of the world’s largest militaries
","You might not picture a troop of Wisconsin deer hunters when thinking about global military powers, but some social media users are out to change that.  ""There were over 600,000 hunters this season in the state of Wisconsin,"" read a 2021 Facebook post. ""Allow me to restate that number: 600,000! Over the last several months, Wisconsin’s hunters became the eighth largest army in the world."" The post went on to claim that although 600,000 people were ""deployed to the woods of a single American state, Wisconsin, to hunt with firearms … NO ONE WAS KILLED.""  The post began amassing more shares in recent days following a series of deadly mass shootings around the U.S. In addition to Wisconsin, the post said that 750,000 people hunted in Pennsylvania and another 700,000 people hunted in Michigan — all of whom took to the woods and later ""returned home safely."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The sweeping claims overstate what can be learned from deer hunting licenses and overlook what we know about the comparative size of military forces around the world. Wisconsin reported that 820,299 deer hunting licenses were sold for the 2020 season, which would have been the most recent season when the post was first shared on May 23, 2021. While this number surpasses the 600,000 figure shared in the Facebook post, it included bow and crossbow licenses, not just gun hunting licenses, according to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Of the total number of deer licenses sold, 569,203 were for gun privileges, according to the preliminary license sale figures released on Dec. 1, 2020. That’s almost 31,000 people short of the ""army"" of 600,000 deer hunters the Facebook post claimed live in Wisconsin. However, there’s no proof that each of the people who purchased licenses to hunt with firearms in Wisconsin are state residents. Wisconsin sells nonresident licenses for gun deer hunting. The department said nonresident license sales decreased in 2020, likely because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but did not give an indication of the usual number of these sales.  The department did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for finalized numbers or information about the number of Wisconsin residents who hunt with firearms. The Facebook post also inflated the number of deer hunters in Michigan. Ed Golder, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, said that in 2020, Michigan had 616,235 unique deer hunters, or individuals who bought a deer license of any type for the season. Nearly 80% of them — or 488,422 hunters — participated in the regular firearm deer season, Golder said. We did not find data on the number of deer hunters in Pennsylvania in 2020, and the Pennsylvania Game Commission did not respond to PolitiFact’s information request. The post was also incorrect by suggesting that ""no one died"" while hunting. In Wisconsin, there were 18 hunting-related gun incidents that included one death during the 2020 hunting season. In Michigan in 2020, there were six hunting-related gun injuries, including two fatalities. The most recent incident report available for Pennsylvania was from 2019, when 21 hunting-related gun incidents were reported, including three deaths. Even if 600,000 armed hunters lived in Wisconsin, the group wouldn’t constitute a strikingly large global force, as the post claimed. There aren’t many country-by-country comparisons of military force size, but 2021 data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies indicates that more than 10 countries have at least 1 million military personnel. An army of 600,000 wouldn’t make the top 15 largest military forces when comparing estimated total military personnel, according to 2022 data from Global Firepower, an organization that evaluates military strength and assigns countries rankings. Global Firepower’s data shows that more than 10 countries have forces in which the total number of military personnel is estimated to exceed 1 million. This includes the organization’s highest-ranked militaries overall: the U.S., Russia and China. Based only on the number of military personnel, Bangladesh has about 7 million, India has about 5.13 million, and China has 3.13 million, per Global Firepower’s metrics. The next five are: Brazil, North Korea, the U.S., Venezuela and Taiwan — all with 1.5 million or more total military personnel. A post claimed that the sale of more than 600,000 Wisconsin deer licenses shows that Wisconsin’s hunters are the ""eighth largest army in the world.""  The post inflates the number of gun deer hunting licenses sold in Wisconsin for the 2020 hunting season by more than 30,000. There’s also no indication that each of the roughly 569,000 gun deer licenses sold were sold to residents of the state. Some were sold to non-residents. Even if Wisconsin had 600,000 deer hunters who use firearms, the group would not be the eighth largest army in the world. We rate this claim False.

No, Biden didn’t give Americans the ‘cheapest’ gas prices on Earth.
","President Joe Biden has faced a lot of criticism over the rising cost of fuel in the United States.  But some social media posts have recently taken the opposite route, praising Biden for keeping gas prices low and claiming that fuel costs much more in other countries. On June 2, a Twitter user shared an illustration comparing gas prices around the world with a caption that read:  ""My plan is to thank President Biden for giving Americans the cheapest gas prices on Earth. I gassed up today for $4.29 a gallon at Exxon. Thanks Joe."" The illustration shows expensive prices for gas in places like Hong Kong ($10.71 a gallon) and Norway ($10.19 a gallon). It lists the United States as the lowest at $4.46 a gallon.  The prices aren’t far off, but the premise that the U.S. has the ""cheapest"" fuel in the world, and that it’s because of Biden, is wrong.  ""This is true if you only look at Western Europe,"" said Ramanan Krishnamoorti, a professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Houston. ""The U.S. is right smack in the middle of the pack when it comes to gas prices. At one end, you have Western Europe, and at the other are Saudi Arabia and Iran.""  As of June 6, the average price of a regular gallon of gasoline in the U.S. is $4.87, according to the American Automobile Association. The average global price of gasoline, meanwhile, is $5.35 per gallon, according to data reported May 30 by energy tracking company GlobalPetrolPrices.com. The U.S currently ranks 67th out of the 170 countries that the company tracks. Venezuela is the least expensive at $0.08 per gallon while Hong Kong ranks the most expensive at $11.20 a gallon.  ""Just as I don't think you can blame Biden for high gas prices, I don't think you can give Biden credit for low gas prices compared with other countries,"" said Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. The Biden administration’s releases from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve are likely keeping prices down a little bit, experts said, but that effect is largely diluted across the global market. So while the government might be lowering American gas prices, they're lowering prices in other countries as well. Multiple factors influence the difference of gasoline prices between countries; the two biggest are whether countries produce oil and the amount of taxes and fees they place on gas. The U.S. is the world’s top producer of oil, followed by Saudi Arabia and Russia, and the federal government levies very few taxes on fuel, which keeps American gas prices among the lowest in industrialized nations. ""Compared to most other major developed nations, the U.S. has fairly low fuel taxes: 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline at the federal level, plus taxes that vary by state. Compare that with Norway, where the tax is 4.95 Krone per liter, which works out to about $2 per gallon,"" Williams-Derry said. ""It's been that way for a long time, not something that started a few years ago. Also, fuel taxes are set by Congress, and Biden has zippo to do with the current level of U.S. and state fuel taxes in comparison with other nations."" European countries have imposed much higher taxes on drivers, surpassing $3 a gallon in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Italy, and topping $2 per gallon in Germany, France and Belgium, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. While the price of gas may be lower in the U.S. compared with some other countries, no other country is more dependent on automobiles — resulting in Americans spending more on fuel overall.  U.S. motorists drive an average of 14,263 miles a year, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration. The second-highest country is Canada, where drivers average around 9,500 miles per year. Ultimately, Biden has little to do with the current volatility in the market. The most recent spike in gas prices stemmed largely from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. However, gas prices were rising before the Russian troop buildup around Ukraine became front-page news. Inflation, as well as growing consumer demand due to the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, had already been driving up gas prices. A tweet claimed that Biden gave Americans the ""cheapest"" gas prices on Earth. This isn’t accurate. While gas prices in the U.S. are lower than in some European countries because of oil production and taxes, they certainly aren’t the lowest in the world.  Biden has little to do with fuel prices. Oil is part of a global market that is impacted by a slew of factors — like pandemics, inflation and war  — that are largely outside of the president’s control.  We rate this False.  RELATED: Ask PolitiFact: Why are gas prices going up?  RELATED: How much blame does Putin deserve for high gasoline prices? ",/factchecks/2022/jun/06/tweets/no-biden-didnt-give-americans-cheapest-gas-prices-/

No, government data does not say that defensive gun use saves lives
","House Democrats are moving forward with a bill that would enact new restrictions on guns. During a recent hearing, Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona said the bill would fail to reduce crime or make the U.S. safer. ""Millions of Americans safely and responsibly own and use guns,"" Biggs said in the June 2 hearing. ""The Department of Justice under Democratic administrations have done their studies and conservatively estimated that guns are used 1.5 million times per year to save lives."" We contacted Biggs’ office to get the source behind that figure of 1.5 million lives saved by guns and did not hear back. The figure matches one used in a 2008 blog post by the group Gun Owners of America. That post linked to 1997 research published by the department’s National Institute of Justice. The research doesn’t say what Biggs presented. It talks about the defensive use of firearms, but it is silent about any lives saved. In many cases, lives were never at risk. The department’s research was based on a 1994 national telephone survey on gun ownership. If someone said they owned a gun, they were asked, ""Within the past 12 months, have you yourself used a gun, even if it was not fired, to protect yourself or someone else, or for the protection of property at home, work, or elsewhere?"" If they said they had, then they were asked up to 30 additional questions to determine the circumstances around the incident, such as where the incident took place, or if they had seen the person who they felt was a threat. Out of about 2,500 people reached, 45 people said they had used a gun for protection. After filtering out those who could not name the specific criminal threat they faced or had not seen the person they thought was a threat, 19 responses remained. Applying that fraction to the entire U.S. adult population, researchers estimated that guns were used defensively 1.5 million times a year. There’s a hot debate over whether that number is too high or too low, and what it might be today. Before we examine that, there’s one point on which independent researchers agree: The number does not represent the number of lives saved. Philip Cook, professor emeritus of public policy studies at Duke University and co-author of the Justice Department’s research article, said he was confident ""that there were not 1.5 million lives saved in 1994 through defensive gun uses."" ""Many of the crimes being defended against would not have been fatal even without gun defense,"" Cook said. The people who study this area of gun use say that in the surveys, it’s impossible to know what would have happened if someone had not had a firearm.  That’s why researchers wrestle with understanding the circumstances when people have used guns for protection. In a 2000 report, a group of researchers interviewed people who, in a random survey, reported using a gun defensively. They did not find examples when a gun saved someone’s life.  In one case, a man said, ""My alarm at my business went off so I went there to shut it off. Two men were outside my building, so from my car I shot at the ground near them.""  Another told researchers, ""Someone broke in; I woke up to the sound. I got my gun from the safe (loaded it) and went downstairs. The person left and I called the police."" This person didn’t know if the burglar had a weapon. The burglar could have been armed, and the resident could have avoided a potentially deadly encounter. But the data doesn’t reveal the answer. Around the same time as Cook’s research, Gary Kleck, now professor emeritus of criminology at Florida State University, conducted his own survey, asking very similar questions. Kleck estimated that guns were used defensively about 2.5 million times a year. But Kleck distinguished that from saving lives. ""I am not aware of any scientifically based estimates of lives saved,"" Kleck said. This said, stories appear in the news about people who have stopped shooters. To take a recent example, in late May 2022, a woman in Charleston, West Virginia, shot and killed a man who began firing an AR-15-style rifle into a crowd. It doesn’t take much of a leap of faith to conclude that the woman’s actions saved lives. The latest survey of gun owners and their use of firearms estimated that in 2021, guns were used 1.67 million times to protect people or property. That is consistent with the Justice Department study from 25 years ago. But it doesn’t prove that each use saved lives. In 2018, researchers at Rand Corp., a nonprofit consulting group, explored the studies that had been done on guns and self-protection and found a field rife with challenges. ""We conclude that the existing evidence for any causal effect of defensive gun use on reducing harm to individuals or society is inconclusive,"" the authors wrote. One issue was a reliance on self-reporting, with no opportunity for independent confirmation. Surveys try to reduce this problem by including questions to ferret out inconsistent responses, but it’s not perfect. There is a running dispute over whether surveys aimed at detecting the defensive use of firearms over or undercount the actual events. The Rand group came down on the side of those who said that these surveys exaggerate defensive gun use. They also said that another widely cited survey, the annual National Crime Victimization Survey, might undercount defensive gun use. That survey suggested that guns were used about 116,000 a year.  Biggs said that the Justice Department ""conservatively estimated that guns are used 1.5 million times per year to save lives."" The Justice Department published a report with the 1.5 million figure, but that was an estimate of the number of times people used guns to protect themselves, their families or their property. The author said the research did not find that the use was to save lives. Another prominent gun researcher said he knows of no ""scientifically based estimates of lives saved."" A review of this kind of gun research concluded that there is no conclusive evidence that defensive gun use reduces harm to people. The Justice Department’s article did not say what Biggs stated.

Among children, firearms the leading cause of death in 2020
","Are firearms the leading cause of death in children?  In a speech on the Senate floor, Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., recounted details of two recent mass shootings, one in a Buffalo supermarket and the other at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. He called on his colleagues to tighten the nation’s gun laws. ""America doesn’t stand out when it comes to the rate of mental illness, but we are unique among the world’s developed nations in that today the leading cause of death among children is no longer a car accident, is no longer illness or malnourishment. The leading cause of death among children is a firearm,"" Schumer said.  Schumer is correct, depending on you define children, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and analyses from researchers at three academic centers.  The CDC publishes data on the leading causes of death among different demographic groups, providing the most reliable data. In 2020, the leading cause of death among children ages one through 18 involved a firearm. There were 3,219 such deaths in 2020, followed by motor vehicle traffic deaths, of which there were 2,882.  In their report about gun violence, ""A Year in Review: 2020 Gun Deaths in the U.S.,"" researchers at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions analyzed CDC data from 2020 and found that gun violence was the leading cause of death among children, teens, and young adults under age 25. Firearms were also the leading cause of death for children and teens ages 1 to 19, taking the lives of 4,357 young people, they wrote.  The report also found that gun violence claimed more lives in 2020, more than 45,000, than it had during any year on record.   Researchers at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, Leigh Wedenoja and Jaclyn Schildkraut, used CDC data, and found that if ""children"" are defined as people 19 and under, as they said the CDC tends to do, then firearm deaths exceed traffic deaths. Their analysis did not take into account infant-specific types of deaths, such as congenital abnormalities or short gestation.  Rockefeller and Johns Hopkins researchers said that when analyzing the leading causes of death among ""children,"" infants are typically not included because of certain fatal conditions unique to children under a year old.  If infants are included, rankings of the leading causes of death for children up to age 18 change. Congenital abnormalities are the leading cause of death in infants, and surpass the number of firearm deaths among all children up to age 18. In 2020, there were 4,403 deaths from congenital abnormalities, 3,141 deaths from short gestation, or preterm birth and low birth weight, and 1,389 deaths from sudden infant death syndrome. There were 11 infant deaths caused by a firearm in 2020.    We approached Schumer’s office, and Director of Communications Justin Goodman said the office relied on a letter in the New England Journal of Medicine, written by researchers at the University of Michigan, as its source. The researchers wrote that among children and adolescents, defined as people ages 1 to 19, firearms overtook motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of death in 2020.  ""From 2019 to 2020, the relative increase in the rate of firearm-related deaths of all types (suicide, homicide, unintentional, and undetermined) among children and adolescents was 29.5% — more than twice as high as the relative increase in the general population,"" they wrote.   Schumer claimed that the leading cause of death among children is a firearm.  Among children between the ages of one and 18, and ages one and 19, this is true, based on several analyses of CDC data, the leading source for data regarding causes of death.  There are significant causes of death unique to babies up to a year old, such as congenital abnormalities, which is why researchers typically don’t include infants when studying causes of death among children and adolescents.  We rate his claim Mostly True, because what he said is accurate but needs some clarification.  CORRECTION, June 6, 2022: Jaclyn Schildkraut is a researcher at the Rockefeller Institute of Government.

Claim suggests billions should go to SWAT in schools. But there’s more to consider
","After the mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, some people on social media have called for hardening schools with armed officers. One post even suggested hiring a SWAT team for each school. ""We've sent $53,000,000,000 to Ukraine. That's $404,796 per school. You could pay 5 SWAT members $80,000 each and have them at EVERY school front door. With almost $5k left over. They don't care about you … or your kids. Get angry,"" a photo shared on Facebook on May 26 claimed. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) With about 130,930 public and private K-12 schools in the U.S., the math posited in this post works out. But the claim’s premise lacks context. Over the past two decades, more and more schools have opted to bolster their security measures. The amount of public schools with security cameras increased from 19% in 1999 to 91% in 2020, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. The number of schools with locked or monitored building doors also went up during that time. While school budgets vary by state and school district, an estimated $2.7 billion was spent on U.S. school security equipment and services in 2017, according to Omdia, a market-research company. And billions more are spent each year to pay school resource officers, The Washington Post reported. Following the 2018 mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, spending on school safety programs increased by $960 million across at least 26 states, according to education news site The 74. The federal government also allocated an additional $2.3 billion to school safety that year. The premise of the claim also falls short in that research shows no evidence that arming teachers — or in this case, hiring a SWAT team for each school — will protect students in future gun-related incidents. Following the tragedy in Uvalde, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, falsely claimed that having armed law enforcement on campus is ""the most effective tool for keeping kids safe."" But researchers and experts say that when it comes to preventing school shootings, there appears to be more evidentiary support for efforts that emphasize early intervention and support for students than there is for having armed law enforcement on campus. Two weeks after Russia’s invasion began, Congress approved a $13.6 billion aid package to arm and equip Ukrainian forces and provide humanitarian and economic assistance to the region. Then, on May 19, as the invasion neared the three-month mark, the Senate voted 86-11 to approve the largest military and humanitarian aid package for the country to date, bringing the total spending to more than $53 billion. The $40 billion aid package included: About $24 billion to help Ukrainian forces finance weapons purchases, to replenish stocks of U.S. equipment sent to the country and to pay for U.S. troops deployed in nearby countries; More than $13 billion in humanitarian assistance and economic support for Ukraine and other countries affected by the war. With bipartisan support, the aid package was designed to sustain Ukraine for months, rather than weeks, as was the goal of the initial funding. Half of all public K-12 schools in the country already employ law enforcement or school resource officers who routinely carry firearms, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Those in favor of having these armed officers at schools see them as the first line of defense against shooters and other threats. But the consensus among many experts is that armed officers don’t prevent mass school shootings. A 2021 study published by JAMA Network, the American Medical Association’s open access journal, analyzed mass school shootings from 1980 to 2019. The study found the data suggested ""no association between having an armed officer and deterrence of violence in these cases."" Another 2021 study by the Rand Corp., a nonprofit research organization, and the University at Albany, evaluated data from schools between 2014 and 2018 to determine the impact of school resource officers. It found that while school resource officers can protect students from some forms of violence, like physical attacks and fights, there is ""no evidence that SROs prevent school shootings or reduce more serious firearm-related offenses."" In 2018, the Rand Corp. launched a research initiative analyzing thousands of scientific studies to determine the effectiveness of 18 different U.S. gun policies. Through this, Rand found inconclusive evidence that any of these policies, including laws that allow armed staff at K-12 schools, have increased or decreased mass shootings. Research and experts say there is no simple solution. One approach, though, is for schools to have effective early intervention and support systems for students who are experiencing distress. Students tend to show a range of concerning behaviors as their actions escalate to violence. A 2021 study by the U.S. Secret Service concluded that threat assessment — in other words, learning how to recognize behavioral warning signs and intervening effectively — is the best way to prevent targeted school violence. The Educator’s School Safety Network recommends schools take a comprehensive, all-hazards approach to planning for, preventing and responding to violent incidents. This includes threat assessment and security measures, as well as looking for potential vulnerabilities within the school and its daily operations. Often, there is ""a big discrepancy between what the school has written down as a policy or procedure and what they actually do on a day-to-day basis,"" said Amy Klinger, co-founder of the Educator’s School Safety Network. ""And that big discrepancy is a safety issue not just for active shooter (events), but for all kinds of potential safety issues."" A Facebook post claimed that with the $53 billion spent in Ukraine aid, the U.S. ""could pay five SWAT members $80,000 each and have them at EVERY school front door."" The U.S. has allocated about $53 billion in aid to Ukraine. And if one wanted to pay this amount to station five SWAT members at every public and private K-12 school in the country, it would also add up to about $53 billion over one year. But that statement alone lacks context about current security funding for schools and what research shows about the effect of such measures. More than $2.7 billion is already spent each year on school safety equipment and services nationwide. And this $53 billion, if spent as the claim suggested, would cover just one year of SWAT team coverage for schools. Additionally, research shows that the presence of armed officers on campuses does not help prevent school shootings from happening. We rate this claim Half True.

Baldwin wrong that Supreme Court has never taken away a constitutional right
","Many Democrats are asking Americans to consider the consequences of losing access to abortion after the leak of a draft opinion from the U.S. Supreme Court that showed the court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade.  The 1973 landmark decision established a constitutional right to abortion, something Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the leaked draft was ""egregiously wrong from the start.""  U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a D-Wis., has advocated protecting abortion access, including cosponsoring a bill last year that would have guaranteed equal access to abortion across the country.  After the draft opinion was leaked in early May, Baldwin spoke in a May 4, 2022, TMJ4 interview about what else she said she believes could be at risk if Roe is overturned, including access to other constitutional rights. She called the court’s probable decision to overturn a 50-year precedent ""shocking.""  ""I believe it is true that our Supreme Court has never taken away a constitutional right,"" Baldwin said.  ""Never"" is a high bar to clear. Constitutional law scholars say there have been a few examples of the court rolling back such rights, albeit decades and even close to a century ago.  Let’s dig in.  PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out to several professors of constitutional law to gauge the accuracy of Baldwin’s claim.  Two described the same scenario that would make her statement off base.  It begins with the 1905 court case Lochner v. New York, which found that a law forbidding bakers to work more than 60 hours a week, or 10 hours in a day, interfered with ""right of contract."" The court linked that right to the 14th Amendment’s due process clause; essentially, that there was a constitutional right for employers and employees to set their own terms of employment.  That case set off what is known as the ""Lochner era,"" Marquette University law professor Scott Idleman said. During that time, the court struck down a number of laws attempting to set minimum wages, maximum hours and working conditions. That changed in the 1930s with a number of New Deal-era cases where the court departed from its previous view of right of contract protected in the 14th Amendment, said Bernadette Meyler, the Carl and Sheila Spaeth Professor of Law at Stanford Law School.  One of those was the 1937 case West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, in which justices ruled that a Washington state minimum wage law for women did not violate the constitutional requirement of due process in regard to right of contract.  That case limited the scope of economic rights under the 14th Amendment, Meyler said, and Alito cited it in the leaked draft.  A second instance multiple scholars referred to was the 1990 case Employment Division v. Smith, which found that the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause did not contain the right to religious exemptions to ""generally applicable"" laws. In this case, the court decided Oregon could deny unemployment benefits to two employees who were fired for taking illegal drugs that they were using for religious purposes.  That case reversed the 1963 Sherbert v. Verner decision that declared a right to religious exemptions from such laws under the Free Exercise Clause, said Howard Schweber, a professor of American politics and political theory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Since there were at least two instances in American history where the Supreme Court limited a previously outlined constitutional right, that would make Baldwin’s claim off the mark.  But Idleman, the Marquette University professor, said it’s uncommon for rights to be eliminated or even significantly restricted, and added he’d be hard-pressed to find too many more examples.  ""It’s uncommon,"" he said, ""but not unprecedented.""   Baldwin said she believed the ""Supreme Court has never taken away a constitutional right.""  Legal scholars say that although such reversals are uncommon, a few examples do exist.  That makes her claim False.   ",/factchecks/2022/jun/03/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-wrong-supreme-court-has-never-taken-away-c/

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott claims Chicago’s 'tougher' gun laws fail to prevent gun violence
","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, after a mass shooting at an elementary school in his state, pointed to Chicago as an example of how ""real gun laws"" fail to protect school children and teachers from shootings. ""I hate to say this, but there are more people who were shot every weekend in Chicago than there are in schools in Texas,"" he said during a nationally televised news conference the day after the shooting. ""We need to realize that people who think that ‘well, maybe if we could just implement tougher gun laws, it’s going to solve it,’ Chicago and LA and New York disprove that thesis. And so, if you’re looking for a real solution, Chicago teaches that what you’re talking about is not a real solution."" Abbott’s remarks came amid the most recent flurry of demands for tougher gun laws after a gunman at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, killed 19 fourth graders and two teachers on May 24. Abbott’s remarks also recalls a long-repeated Republican talking point that Chicago has the toughest gun laws in the nation. It doesn’t. PolitiFact has fact-checked multiple claims on this point. In every case, the reporting has shown Chicago and Illinois do not have the strictest laws compared to other states, although they are tougher than in Texas. Federal court decisions have loosened once-tough restriction, and many experts agree additional reform could have a positive impact. Since it is difficult to parse Abbott’s comparison of all Chicago shootings to shootings in Texas schools — or statewide Texas shooting deaths to various cities — we decided to compare statewide statistics, which in each state he mentioned are influenced most by urban gun violence. Abbott nor his communications staff returned a request for comment for this fact-check. Chicago’s reputation for strict gun laws is rooted in its 1982 ban on handguns. By 2010, it was the only major city left with a blanket handgun ban. But the ban was struck down in 2010 in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling McDonald v. City of Chicago, which called such outright bans a violation of the Second Amendment to the Bill of Rights. That decision left intact the statewide ban on concealed firearms until two years later when an appeals court declared that unconstitutional as well. Illinois then joined every other state in the nation in allowing licensed citizens to carry concealed firearms. In 2016, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump claimed that Chicago had the toughest gun laws in the United States and more gun violence than any other city. That was Mostly False. The fact check said cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco do more to regulate the concealed-carry permitting process, while Illinois simply processes applications through the Illinois State Police. Despite the 2010 and 2012 court rulings, Illinois still has tougher gun restrictions than Texas. According to Giffords Law Center, an organization which advocates for gun control, Illinois requires universal background checks, gun owner licensing, lost and stolen firearm reporting, waiting periods and has minimum age laws, open carry reporting, community violence intervention funding, risk protection orders and domestic violence gun laws. Texas has none of those. The state does however, have child access prevention laws, which Illinois also has. Gifford’s gave Illinois an A- ranking on its 2021 Annual Gun Law Scorecard — meaning the state has strong laws to reduce the risk of gun-related crimes. Giffords said that while some changes were made in 2020, Illinois as a whole can take measures to improve gun control. Those improvements include: Prohibiting the sale of large-capacity magazines and enacting a gun accountability law. The gun control group also suggested Illinois could ban the manufacturing and selling of ""ghost guns,"" firearms that law enforcement can’t track because they lack serial numbers — an issue Illinois has since addressed in state law enacted this year. Giffords gave Texas an F rating for weak gun laws, along with Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. The only neighboring state with a better grade is New Mexico with a C. At the same time, Illinois and Texas are roughly the same when it comes to gun deaths per capita, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2020, Illinois reported 14.1 gun-related deaths per 100,000, compared to Texas’ 14.2 rate, according to the latest available CDC data. Experts interviewed by the BGA suggest Abbott’s comparison to gun laws in Texas and Chicago are inherently misleading because gun laws in nearby states — such as Indiana and Wisconsin — more resemble those in Texas where less stringent gun laws allow easier access. ""Many factors determine the rates of homicide and violent crime from city to city,"" said Daniel Webster, a co-director of Johns Hopkins’ Center for Gun Violence Solutions. ""You assess the impact of policies by examining changes in homicides and violent crime after gun laws are enacted and contrast that with changes in places that didn’t adopt the policies."" A 2017 Gun Trace Report released by the Chicago Police Department shows the majority of illegal guns came to Chicago from Indiana and outside of Chicago’s city limits. ""The majority of illegally used or possessed firearms recovered in Chicago are traced back to states with less regulation over firearms, such as Indiana and Mississippi,"" the report said. ""More than two of every five traceable crime guns recovered in Chicago originate with their first point of sale at an Illinois dealer."" The remaining 60% of firearms come from out of state, with Indiana as the primary source for one out of every five crime guns. ""This pattern also highlights Chicago’s challenge to address illegal guns within the loosely-regulated national gun market,"" the report said. Abbott’s claim also falls short when it comes to his comparisons to California and New York. In 2020, both California and the state of New York had lower gun death rates than did Texas. Both California and New York have tougher gun laws than Texas, and both are surrounded by states with tougher gun laws compared to a large portion of the rest of the country. Gifford’s classifies California as having the strongest gun laws in the nation. Abbott said Chicago, New York City and LA are all examples of how tough gun laws do not work. While Chicago’s gun laws may be more strict than some states, Abbott’s statement ignores how regulations have been weakened after federal court reversals of the city’s once-tougher restrictions. He also ignores how the majority of firearms in Chicago are coming from neighboring states where gun laws more reflect those of his own state, illustrating the impact of the lack of national regulation.  States like New York and California with lower gun death rates are for the most part surrounded by states with tougher gun laws. We rate this claim Mostly False.  MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",/factchecks/2022/jun/03/greg-abbott/texas-gov-greg-abbott-claims-chicagos-tougher-gun-/

Debunking the zombie claim that ‘dead people always vote Democrat’
","Kevin Rinke’s latest campaign ad is nothing if not eye-catching. The ad, designed to bolster the Michigan car dealer’s campaign for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, features Rinke standing next to an actor made up to look like a zombie wearing a Biden-Harris T-shirt and multiple ""I voted"" stickers. ""Why is it that dead people always vote Democrat(ic)?"" Rinke says, motioning to the zombie with bugged-out eyes and a wide-open mouth. Rinke goes on to accuse Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of failing to crack down on voter fraud, saying that if he wins the governorship, he’ll make sure that voters are ""registered, identified and alive.""  Katie Martin, a Rinke campaign spokesperson, said that a ""quick Google search will show multiple news articles on deceased voters voting in elections."" Ballots cast on behalf of dead people does happen, though it’s a tiny fraction of all votes. However, a Google search like the one the Rinke campaign requested shows that its assertion that dead people ""always"" vote Democratic is itself a zombie claim — and no less mythical than an actual zombie. ""This ad is so incorrect it gave me a headache,"" said Thessalia Merivaki, a political scientist at Mississippi State University who studies voter fraud. She said there is ""zero evidence"" that ballots cast by dead people account for more than a tiny fraction of all votes recorded, and there’s also ""zero evidence"" that such ballots have uniformly been cast in favor of Democrats, Merivaki added. Politicians aligned with former President Donald Trump have consistently raised the specter of voter fraud to explain how Trump could have lost the state to Joe Biden by more than 154,000 votes in the 2020 presidential race after winning it in 2016. But none of these claims hold water. For instance, a viral tweet said Wayne County — home to Detroit — had thousands of ballots cast by deceased voters. However, the list contained names of voters outside the county; several were not listed as ever having received or cast an absentee ballot; and at least one voter listed said she was alive and cast a ballot in the election. The Michigan Secretary of State’s office has previously said that it is ""not aware of a single confirmed case showing that a ballot was actually cast on behalf of a deceased individual in the state."" Officials have ways to flag deceased voters, and clerks across the state successfully identified thousands of voters who submitted absentee ballots in 2020 but died before Election Day. Their ballots weren’t counted. In total, clerks across Michigan rejected 3,469 absentee ballots cast by people who were alive when they returned them but died before Election Day on Nov. 3, 2020. A review by Michigan’s Office of the Auditor General thoroughly debunked charges by Trump and his allies that thousands of ballots were cast on behalf of dead Michigan voters in the 2020 election. The vast majority — 98.8% — of votes cast by those who died before the 2020 election passed away less than 40 days before Election Day. Ballots cast on behalf of dead voters are rare in other states, too. Merivaki pointed to a 2021 study of Washington state’s vote-by-mail program, a system that is used statewide. The analysis found ""extraordinarily low rates of potential fraud related to deceased individuals’ ballots."" The study concluded that ""among roughly 4.5 million distinct voters in Washington state (2011-18), we estimate that there are 14 deceased individuals whose ballots might have been cast suspiciously long after their death, representing 0.0003% of voters. Even these few cases may reflect two individuals with the same name and birth date, or clerical errors, rather than fraud."" An official review in Georgia found that in the 2020 election, just four absentee ballots were cast on behalf of deceased voters.  What fraud cases do exist include many examples of voters acting in grief over the loss of a relative. For instance, in Pierce County, Washington, auditor Julie Anderson found five instances of ballot fraud on behalf of dead voters in the 2020 election, several of which were cast by ""a household member who firmly believes their loved one would have wanted to vote and wanted to participate,"" the Tacoma News Tribune reported. (The newspaper did not report the partisan affiliation of the voters.) States like Michigan typically make public whether a voter has cast a ballot in a given election, but they do not specify for whom an individual has voted. In fact, the government doesn’t even know how someone voted because a marked-up absentee ballot is removed from its envelope before being counted, a process that separates specific votes cast from a voter’s identifying information. When we combed news reports in recent years for cases of ballot fraud on behalf of deceased voters, we found that Republicans were more often the perpetrators. This does not mean that only Republicans perpetrate this kind of fraud; ours is not a scientific study, and it’s possible that other occurrences, by either Democrats or Republicans, have not been detected or reported on. (One study commissioned by WBBM-TV in Chicago found that 119 ballots were cast on behalf of dead people in the city over the decade ended in 2016; although the city is heavily Democratic, the partisan leanings of the perpetrators are unclear.) Regardless, the presence of any Republicans committing this sort of voter fraud is enough to undercut Rinke’s sweeping statement that only Democrats do it. Here are some examples: • Nevada: In the aftermath of Biden’s roughly 34,000-vote win over Trump in Nevada, Donald Kirk Hartle, a Republican, told KLAS-TV that he was ""surprised"" to see that his wife cast a ballot ""because she passed away three years ago. That is pretty sickening to me, to be honest with you."" While Hartle’s story gained attention from GOP leaders and pundits who were questioning the results of the state’s presidential vote, the tale eventually fell apart, as investigators concluded that Hartle himself had cast the fraudulent ballot.  Hartle pleaded guilty to one count of voting more than once in an election, receiving a sentence of probation and a $2,000 fine.  • Pennsylvania: Bruce Bartman from Marple voted on behalf of his late mother in the 2020 presidential election. He pleaded guilty to two counts of perjury and one count of unlawful voting and was sentenced to five years of probation. Bartman said his illegal vote was cast for Donald Trump, The Associated Press reported. He also registered his late mother-in-law but did not secure an absentee ballot for her. Bartman apologized, telling the court, ""I was isolated last year in lockdown. I listened to too much propaganda and made a stupid mistake."" Meanwhile, in August 2021, a man from the Wilkes-Barre area pleaded guilty to a third-degree misdemeanor — not for voting fraudulently but for filing an absentee ballot application in the name of his late mother. The application cited a need to vote absentee because the man’s mother was purportedly ""visiting great grandkids Oct. 24-Nov. 10."" The defendant, Robert Richard Lynn, was a registered Republican, the Times-Leader newspaper reported, citing state records. He was sentenced to six months of probation and 40 hours of community service.  • Florida: In 2020, voter Larry Wiggins of Manatee County tried to ""test"" the system by requesting a ballot for his late wife. ""I heard so much about ballots being sent in and people just having found them in different places,"" Wiggins told WFLA-TV. ""I feel like I haven’t done anything wrong."" He told the Tampa station, ""I said, Well, let me just send it in and see what’s going to happen, to see if they’re actually going to send a ballot for her to vote."" The request was flagged by the local elections office when it went through standard identity checks, so Wiggins did not receive a ballot. Instead, his case received a criminal referral. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to 24 months of probation and 100 hours of community service. Wiggins told WFLA that he was a Democrat who supported Trump. • Arizona: Tracey Kay McKee of Phoenix cast her late mother’s ballot in the 2020 general election. She was sentenced to two years of probation, fines and community service.  Both McKee and her recently deceased mother were registered Republicans, the Associated Press reported. In court, prosecutors noted that McKee railed against absentee voting during an interview with investigators in which she denied casting the ballot herself, saying, ""I don’t believe that this was a fair election. I do believe there was a lot of voter fraud."" • Colorado: In 2017, a woman from Golden pleaded guilty to voting twice for her late father. Toni Lee Newbill had cast ballots in the 2013 general election and the 2016 Republican primary. Rinke said, ""Dead people always vote Democrat."" Not every case of voting on behalf of the dead has been discovered, adjudicated in court, and received media coverage. However, six cases that have surfaced during the past five years produced either a plea of guilty or no contest, and in each case the defendant was either a registered Republican or acknowledged voting for Trump.  Even this small number of cases is enough to invalidate Rinke’s sweeping statement that only Democrats do this. We rate the statement False.

Salter’s Buffalo slaying was unrelated to his work on water-powered engines
","Aaron Salter Jr. was working as a security guard at Tops Friendly Markets in Buffalo, New York, on May 14 when an 18-year-old man opened fire on shoppers. Police say Salter, 55, fired at the gunman several times before he himself was slain — one of 10 people shot to death by a white man who police say was motivated to kill Black people. But a claim on Facebook is spinning a different tale about Salter, a retired police lieutenant who has been hailed as a hero, suggesting that he was killed because he was working on making a water-powered vehicle. ""Mr. Salter was just on the news about a month ago explaining an invention he made, which was an engine that runs completely off water, no fuel needed,"" said a man in a Facebook video posted May 30 and shared tens of thousands of times. ""A completely hydrogen-fuel(ed) system. And we all know what happened to the last person who decided to come forth with an invention similar to this one."" That’s an apparent reference to Stanley Meyer, an inventor of a water-powered fuel cell for car engines. Meyer, who died in 1998, has been at the center of a decades-old conspiracy theory that he was killed by the government for his invention. We’ve fact-checked that claim to be False. Like the claim about Meyer, this video about Salter was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s true that Salter was working to power vehicles with water. But there is no evidence that work made him a target in a mass shooting. In a May 16 call to law enforcement, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray was clear about what investigators believe motivated these killings: ""From everything we know, this was a targeted attack, a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism."" Payton Gendron, armed with three firearms and tactical gear, drove more than 200 miles from his hometown, Conklin, New York, to the Tops grocery store, police said. He shot four people in the parking lot of the store, three of whom died, then went inside and shot eight more, police say. Video that Gendron live streamed from the scene captured glimpses of Salter’s attempts to halt the rampage, according to reporting by The Buffalo News. An 180-page screed that was posted online and attributed to Gendron detailed his belief in the ""great replacement theory,"" a racist conspiracy that claims immigrants and people of color will replace white people in the country in order to outvote them and replace them racially. The document described Black people as ""replacers.""  None of the victims in the mass shooting are named in the online document, and there is no evidence that Gendron knew who his victims were ahead of time. But 11 of the 13 killed or injured in the attack were Black, including Salter.  Friends and family remembered Salter for his nearly 30 years on the Buffalo police force.  ""Even in his retirement, he literally made Tops his priority,"" Salter’s son, Aaron Salter III, told the Democrat & Chronicle newspaper. ""He made sure he was there and he was making sure that the store was safe at all times."" Salter was also working to complete his bachelor’s degree at Canisius College and, according to his LinkedIn profile, ran a business called AWS Hydrogen Technologies, LLC. While the Facebook video described Salter as being on the ""news"" for his car technology, it appears to have drawn clips from two 2015 YouTube videos in which Salter spoke about his work applying  water electrolysis, the process of using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, to fuel vehicles. ""I'm always working on my vehicles and or my project of running engines on water for the last four years or so,"" Salter wrote on his LinkedIn profile. ""I would like to realize my dream of getting cars to run off of water using my newly discovered energy source some day."" In one of the YouTube videos, Salter showed the hydrogen electrolysis generator he had built in the back of his truck and gave a step-by-step presentation of how the generator worked, along with the truck's original gas engine, to power the vehicle. Salter also tested how long the vehicle could run on hydrogen by using only the generator. In another video, he told a colleague that his interest in alternative energy sources started with solar power. A viral conspiracy shared across social media, including in a Facebook post, claims that Aaron Salter Jr. was killed in the Buffalo mass shooting  because of his work creating a water-powered engine for vehicles. Salter was indeed working on water-powered vehicle technology. But there is no evidence backing the claim that he was targeted because of it. Salter, along with nine other victims, was shot and killed by a gunman who police say targeted them because they were Black. Three other people were injured in the attack.  We rate the social media claim False.",/factchecks/2022/jun/02/facebook-posts/salters-buffalo-slaying-was-unrelated-his-work-wat/

Despite uptick in border encounters, policies for adults traveling alone haven't changed under Biden
","A group of state attorneys general sued the Biden administration over its plans to rescind a public health policy intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by expelling immigrants arriving illegally at the southwest border. A federal judge on May 20 blocked the Biden administration from ending the policy, known as Title 42.  Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who is running for U.S. Senate and was among those who sued the administration, tweeted a comparison of the number of adult immigrants traveling alone and encountered by border authorities in April 2020 and April 2022.  In April 2020, it was 15,609. In April 2022, it grew to 166,814. ""Border policies matter,"" wrote Brnovich, who ​​is seeking to win Arizona’s Republican primary Aug. 2.  Border policies matter. The number of single adult illegal border-crossers? April 2022 (Biden) - 166,814April 2020 (Trump) - 15,609 This comparison has several issues. Brnovich’s tweet insinuated that the change in the number of encounters is a result of different policies under President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Although some border policies have changed from one administration to another, those affecting adults crossing the border alone, which Customs and Border Protection classifies as ""single adults,"" have not. Under the pandemic policy, immigrants are quickly expelled and don’t face penalties for crossing the border without authorization. This has led to more immigrants attempting to cross the border multiple times and has contributed to an increase in the monthly numbers of encounters, experts said. Brnovich’s claim also doesn’t take into account the dynamics of the pandemic in early 2020, when lockdowns and restrictions were at their peak, and in 2022, when many of those measures had ended. In fiscal year 2020,  the number of encounters at the border was the lowest in April 2020; encounters generally have climbed every month after.   Brnovich’s tweet singles out CBP data from April 2020, right at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic when most of the U.S. and the world was under lockdown. Policies limiting the movement of people both within the U.S. and across countries led to a decrease in migration worldwide. Vaccines had not yet been created, and personal protective equipment, like face masks, were scarce. Governments and health officials dissuaded many people from leaving their homes as they learned more about the virus and how it spread. Two years later, the world has changed. Vaccines are more widely accessible, and most lockdown restrictions have been lifted. Some countries are dealing with battered economies as a result of the pandemic.  Although comparing similar months of immigration data is usually advisable, given the seasonal nature of migration, experts said comparisons of April 2020 and April 2022 are not sound.  ""Selecting only two months from only two years as Mr. Brnovich did qualifies as an extremely selective and decontextualized comparison, or more colloquially, ‘cherry-picking,’"" said Austin Kocher, a research assistant professor at Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. ""This does not mean that he is necessarily wrong in his conclusion, only that his choice of data does not necessarily add up to his policy conclusion."" When an immigrant at the southwest border attempts to enter the country illegally,  officials have two options — and these options have been the same under both Trump and Biden.  One option: enforce immigration law and either turn away immigrants or allow them into the U.S. to seek relief, such as asylum. Another option: quickly expel immigrants to Mexico or their countries of origin, based on the pandemic policy to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.  When people are apprehended under immigration law, they can face legal consequences such as fines, misdemeanor charges or barred access to future asylum. People who are determined to have repeatedly attempted crossing can also be subject to felony charges.  But people who are expelled under the pandemic policy do not face any immigration penalties. As a result, there’s been an increase in the number of encounters recorded by CBP and in the percentage of people trying to cross the border more than once. Under Biden, there have been some changes in the implementation of border policies for unaccompanied children and families. But for adults traveling alone — the group that Brnovich highlighted — policies have remained the same. Syracuse University's Kocher said a shift in the tone around immigration from the Biden administration could lead to more immigrants trying to cross the border at the same time that COVID-19 restrictions have also relaxed.  But experts also emphasize that U.S. policies alone don’t influence decisions to migrate. ""Migration has always been multicausal: that is, people migrate because of a wide range of intersecting drivers — poverty, criminal and political violence, climate change,"" said Maria Cristina Garcia, a professor of American Studies at Cornell University. Many of these factors have been aggravated by the pandemic. Brnovich said increased encounters at the southwest border in April 2022 compared with April 2020 are attributable to changes in border policy. Brnovich’s data tracks with CBP’s numbers. But the cherry-picked numbers don’t tell the whole story. In April 2020, lockdowns and the uncertainty of COVID-19 restricted people’s movements. By April 2022, testing and vaccines were more accessible, and lockdown restrictions were largely lifted.  Border encounters have generally increased monthly after April 2020. However, immigration policies for adults traveling alone have been the same under the Trump and Biden administrations. Brnovich’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2022/jun/02/mark-brnovich/despite-uptick-border-encounters-policies-adults-t/
