Sen. Rob Portman says hundreds of tax preferences and loopholes have been added since 1986
","
The only things certain in life are death, taxes, and Rob Portman’s interest is in the latter. The first-term Ohio U.S. senator is, after all, a former budget director in President George W. Bush’s cabinet, and tax reform is one of his foremost goals.

Just which tax rates and preferences need reforming is a political judgment. But the scope of the challenge caught our attention when Portman told the Fox Business Networkon Feb. 20:

""There have been literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since 1986, last time we did this.""

That’s a lot of new references and loopholes, and we were curious about the number. So we asked Portman’s press secretary, Caitlin Dunn, who sent us two sources to support the senator’s claim.

First was an August 2010 report to the White House by President Barack Obama’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board, which laid out a menu of optionsfor simplification and better compliance within the tax system. The board included leaders in economics, business and labor and was chaired by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Like Portman, this committee cited 1986 as a baseline, because that was the last time Congress overhauled the nation’s tax code.

Among the committee’s observations: ""The tax code has become more complex and more unstable over the last two decades, in part because legislators have increasingly used targeted tax provisions to achieve social policy objectives normally achieved by spending programs. There have been more than 15,000 changes to the tax code since 1986, and a current JCT (Joint Committee on Taxation) pamphlet lists 42 pages of expiring provisions.""

That 15,000 figure was also in the second source that Dunn sent us: a statement from a 2010 Senate hearing, by Sen.Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana. Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said, ""We have made 15,000 changes to the tax code since 1986, but many of these changes have stretched the code in different directions.""

If you read these statements closely, you’ll notice that they don’t say exactly the same thing as Portman said. These statements talk about thousands of changes -- but a change can mean many things, including revocation of tax breaks, new rates, a reinterpretation of a rule or even a technical correction, according to a number of budget experts with whom we spoke. Affirming this was Austan Goolsbee, an economist at the University of Chicago and the staff director of the President’s Economic Advisory Board in 2010 -- that is, the Volcker committee whose report was cited as a source by Portman’s office for the 15,000 ""changes"" in the tax code.

""Definitely those are not all loopholes,"" Goolsbee told us in an email. ""That would include every change to the code.""

So how many of them were new loopholes or preferences?

We called Tax Analysts, a Northern Virginia publisher of in-depth analyses of tax law, and asked Martin Sullivan, the chief economist.

Sullivan used to work for the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. He was somewhat skeptical of broad claims on numbers in these matters. For example, if an existing law is changed and it results in a single section being split into a dozen or more parts -- but with provisions that already existed -- do you count that as a dozen new provisions?

He recalled counting the changes in a single tax law in 1997 -- 400 of them, he says. He says many of them resulted in tax cuts. But that does not mean they were all loopholes or special provisions. Four-hundred new loopholes in a single year would, in fact, be eye-popping.

Continuing our quest for a number, we turned to congressional testimony from hearings on the need for tax reform, and found the prepared text for a March, 2011 Senate hearing by Fred T. Goldberg Jr., who co-heads the tax group at the Washington law firm Skadden Arps. Goldberg is a former IRS commissioner, former IRS chief counsel, and former assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy.

In his written statement, he referred to the ""endless stream"" of bills that followed the 1986 tax reform, and the ""mind-numbing complexity"" of the tax code that only grew worse.  

In other words, tax preferences grew. But this still did not give us a number.

So we talked with Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Urban Institute and its Tax Policy Center. A former deputy assistant director for tax policy at the Congressional Budget Office, Williams said there has definitely been an expansion of the tax code, in many cases promoting policy makers’ social and economic goals such as education (with tax credits), work (the earned income tax credit), retirement security (individuual retirement account changes) and so on.

Stir in corporate tax provisions and the number adds up.

Does it add up to hundreds?

""I certainly haven’t counted,"" Williams said.

As we continued down this road, the question took on the characteristics of a puzzle, if not a chase down a rabbit hole. Portman’s claim rang true, but no one had a precise way of measuring the number. Several experts, however, introduced us to the closest thing: The annual lists of ""tax expenditures"" published by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation and, separately, the White House in its annual budget documents.

A tax expenditure is a tax break, credit, deduction, exclusion or exemption granted for a specific purpose -- to spur energy production or education or employment, for example, or to exempt interest on certain construction bonds from taxes, or to provide special depreciation allowances for ethanol production plants. Some people call these loopholes, although every one of them is allowed for in the tax code, and they certainly qualify under Portman’s characterization of ""tax preferences.""

This gave us a benchmark. And in 2006, the Congressional Research Service, or CRS, said in a report that there were 133 of these tax expenditures as of 1987, the year following tax reform. The CRS prepares research reports to help lawmakers understand the history and background of particular issues.

Have tax expenditures, or special provisions, grown by the hundreds since then?

Not if you use the number on a CRS report last March 22, which said that there were now ""over 200"" separate tax expenditures. And that figure of ""over 200"" differed with one the White House used, compiled by the Treasury Department for inclusion in President Barack Obama’s fiscal year 2013 budget request. That document listed, item by item, 188 -- everything from expensing of certain small business investments to income averaging for farmers.

Providing us with a slightly different number was Leonard Burman, a professor and economist at Syracuse University and former deputy assistant Treasury secretary for tax analysis. Burman sent us a chart based on information from the Joint Committee on Taxation. It showed there were 202 tax expenditures in 2007. Since there were 133 right after tax reform, that would not suggest growth by the hundreds.

Burman concluded that Portman was ""exaggerating a bit,"" but he added that Portman’s ""basic point was right -- there has been a proliferation of tax preferences.""

It was beginning to look as if Portman might be wrong. But in all these discussions was a caveat: The lists of tax expenditures are incomplete and imperfect. We’ve noted already that the White House lists and joint tax committee lists don’t align, for various technical and interpretive reasons.

But more importantly, the lists are nothing more than reports of tax breaks in effect at a given  point in time. If a provision is changed but its structure remains the same or similar, it may not get counted as a new tax expenditure, even though the change could benefit someone new or restrict someone else.

Such problems were pointed out to us by Alex Brill, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Brill served as an adviser on Obama’s fiscal commission in 2010, and was an economist for President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers in 2001 and 2002. More pertinent for today’s purposes, he was policy director and chief economist on the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee -- the committee that writes the tax laws -- -- from 2002 to 2007.

Brill told us, ""There is no single, absolute, universal means with which to count.""

Brill sent us the prepared testimony from September 22, 2011, of  Thomas A. Barthold, chief of staff the Joint Committee on Taxation, before the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction.
In his prepared remarks, Barthold included a graph of tax expenditures. It showed that in 1986, there were about 130 of them.

The number had hit 250 by 2009, dropping slightly in 2010. These were only tax expenditures that had a cumulative value of $50 million or more. But Barthold provided the committee with something better: a list of tax expenditures that have been added to the tax code since the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

We counted them and got 157 -- still not in the hundreds when measuring expansion or changes.

Brill, however, found a number of things missing from that list.  For example, the new medical device tax in the Affordable Care Act of 2010 and its exclusion of certain items was not listed, nor was a drug tax from the same bill, even though it excludes certain drugs -- a provision that could be considered a preference.

Brill said he found at least four examples from health reform, ""and there are more from just that bill if you dig deeper.""

Also missing from the list, he noticed, was the frequently criticized NASCAR tax break, a provision from the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 that allowed for accelerated depreciation of race tracks. That bill alone had ""tons of provisions"" that amounted to narrow tax breaks, Brill said.

We counted the breaks in that bill, using a Joint Committee on Taxation document listing the effects of each new provision on tax revenue in the 2004 act. We came up with 179.

So Portman, after all of this, appears to be correct: There have been ""literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since 1986, last time we did this.""

Exactly how many, no one knows. We even asked Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economics professor, president emeritus of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and President Ronald Reagan’s chief economic adviser from 1982 through 1984. Feldstein’s name came up during conversations with others, partly because he, too, was on the Volcker committee whose 15,000 figure was cited by Portman’s office.

When we asked by email about those 15,000 changes and whether they included more than loopholes and preferences, Feldstein replied, ""I’m sorry but I don’t know. I believe that many were added in the Clinton administration as a way of achieving increased government spending through the tax code.""

That may seem a bit political, but economists see tax expenditures just as Feldstein described: a way of achieving a goal without direct spending. They cost the government, regardless.

We are still without a precise count of the number of loopholes and preferences added after the 1986 tax reform. Brill, however, took a stab at it, telling us, ""Certainly it less than 15,000,"" but well more than the other numbers mentioned here.

Initially, he guessed it might be 300, but after looking at just a couple of tax-related bills he concluded that ""I think its far, far more than that.""

So we were able to find enough documentation to prove it, even though Portman used an educated guess, not a hard figure. We rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/11/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-hundreds-tax-preferences-and-/
"['Recreation', 'Guns', 'Wisconsin', 'Vicki McKenna']","
Talk show host Vicki McKenna says proposed rules on bullets would essentially ban deer hunting
","In the months following the Sandy Hook school massacre, Wisconsin Democrats moved to restrict access to firearms and ammunition.

Those efforts included the drafting of a bill in the state Assembly by Reps. Frederick Kessler, Evan Goyke and Mandela Barnes, all Milwaukee Democrats.

Among other things, the bill would restrict sales and possession of hollow-point bullets, a type of ammunition that expands on impact and creates even larger wounds. Authorities said Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook killer, used bullets designed to inflict maximum damage by breaking up in a victim’s body. Kessler argued banning such bullets would give the victims of a mass shooting at least a chance of survival.

But that bill would have a far greater impact, said conservative talk show host Vicki McKenna on Feb. 18, 2013.

It would end deer hunting, a key part of the state’s culture, said McKenna, whose show is aired in Milwaukee, Madison and LaCrosse.

""Democrats in Wisconsin want to fight crime by banning deer hunting,"" McKenna said.

She explained that the bill ""proposed taking hollow-pointed ammunition off the shelves. Which essentially bans deer hunting because you can only use an expanding bullet to deer hunt.""

That caught our attention. After all, the state sold more than 614,000 licenses as of the start of the gun deer season in November 2012. That’s equivalent to a little more than 10 percent of the state’s population.

So is McKenna right? Would Kessler’s bill blow away the gun deer hunt? (We’ll avoid picking nits and assume the bow hunting season would remain.)

We turned to the experts to learn more about bullets and Bambi.

The proposed legislation

According to the Legislative Reference Bureau: ""This bill prohibits a person, with certain exceptions such as for law enforcement, from selling, transporting, manufacturing, or possessing any hollowpoint bullet, any bullet that expands or flattens easily in the human body, or any bullet with a hard envelope that does not entirely cover the core of the bullet.""

That bans a lot of bullets.

But what does this have to do with deer hunting?

We asked Tim Lawhern, the state Department of Natural Resource’s top official on such matters.

For years, state law required hunters of deer and others species to use hollow-point bullets, said Lawhern, administrator of the DNR’s enforcement and science division.

The law was modified a couple years ago because more and more hunters were hunting with a different sort of ammunition -- often made of solid copper --  that also changed shape on impact, but was not a hollow point.

State law now says it’s illegal to hunt deer with ""non-expanding bullets.""

Said Lawhern: ""It must be the expanding type of ammunition.""

The idea is that bullets that expand on impact do more damage, cause greater hemorrhaging, and the animal dies in a swifter, more humane manner, Lawhern explained.

So Kessler and company want to ban the very kind of bullets that hunters are required to use.

What ammo would that leave hunters with?

""Nothing,"" said Lawhern. ""Archery. You could use archery equipment.""

Banning hollow-point bullets ""would have a negative impact on deer hunting,"" said George Meyer, former DNR secretary and executive director of Wisconsin Wildlife Federation.

""If they don’t have any ammunition they could use, it certainly doesn’t sound good if you’re a hunter,"" Lawhern said.

Legions of hunters would have the same reaction about an expanding-bullet ban, he added.

""You’ll have the largest army in the world saying, ‘What, are you nuts?’""

A change in plans

Apparently they won’t have to worry.

Shortly after word got out -- including on McKenna’s show -- Kessler admitted he and the other lawmakers had shot themselves in the foot.

They’re rewriting the bill to ""remove any conflicts of law and provide exemptions that honor our state’s great sporting heritage,"" Kessler said in a Feb. 19, 2013, statement, a day after McKenna’s show on the subject.

The bill ""was never intended to conflict with current laws or codes related to Wisconsin’s rich hunting tradition and those who annually participate in it,"" Kessler said, adding that the draft bills ""contained unintended oversights.""

He added: ""We will be working with the Legislative Reference Bureau, Legislative Council and the Department of Natural Resources to ensure that any future bill drafts are consistent with current sporting and hunting regulations.""

Kessler said in an interview that he still wants to limit sales of hollow-point bullets, but with an exemption for hunters.

Such ammunition would be available ""only to people who have licenses to hunt, who are on their way to hunt and it’s hunting season, "" Kessler said.

So let’s bag this one.

McKenna said a proposal to restrict sale and possession of hollow-point and flattening or expanding bullets ""essentially bans deer hunting.""

McKenna’s right on an important front. Deer hunters are required to use bullets that expand on impact -- including hollow points. And Kessler wanted to ban those very bullets. So it would leave gun hunters without bullets.

But she’s wrong by suggesting that the Democrats were seeking to ban hunting.

Kessler admitted hunting never crossed his mind when the bill was drafted in an effort to protect mass shooting victims. The city slickers came up with a bill with a problem that stood out like a white tail between the cross hairs.

As it stood, the law would have banned the bullets. But it didn’t ban hunting. We rate McKenna’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/10/vicki-mckenna/talk-show-host-vicki-mckenna-proposed-rules-bullet/
"['New Jersey', 'Taxes', 'Barbara Buono']","
Barbara Buono claims Chris Christie still supports tax cut he proposed in early 2012
","
When it comes to claims about tax cuts in New Jersey, gubernatorial candidate Barbara Buono just can’t catch a break.

That’s because Buono, a Democrat and state senator from Middlesex County, keeps repeating a claim about Gov. Chris Christie that leaves out significant details and has accuracy issues.

And she did it again Tuesday, during her first national television appearance on the MSNBC program ""Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell.""

During a nearly five-minute segment, Buono talked about why she’s the best candidate to be New Jersey’s next governor, citing issues such as the state’s rate of unemployment, foreclosures, economic growth and taxes.

""Governor Christie, his idea of jumpstarting the economy is to propose a trickle-down income tax cut last year and in his budget address this year, he stated his support for it again,"" Buono said during the segment.

In a previous claim on this topic, Buono tied the Republican governor’s support of an income tax cut to it disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest New Jerseyans. The Truth-O-Meter ruled that claim Pants on Fire.

First, some background on Christie’s tax cut proposal.

In January 2012 Christie proposed cutting income tax rates by 10 percent across-the-board over three years. Under that proposal, higher-income taxpayers would have seen a greater decrease because they pay more in income taxes.

But after Democrats cried foul, the governor backed off that plan and endorsed a proposal to cut income taxes only for New Jerseyans below a certain income level and based on their annual property tax bills. 
Christie unveiled that proposal in July. His tax-cut plan was based on a proposal made by one of Buono’s colleagues -- Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester).

Under Christie’s revised proposal, homeowners with taxable income of $400,000 or less would receive an income tax credit based on their property tax bills. The credit would be phased in over four years and ultimately reach 10 percent of the first $10,000 in property taxes paid.

The Legislature, however, was concerned whether the state could afford it and decided to delay any cut to see if Christie’s revenue projections would hit his target. The target wasn’t met and the tax cut wasn’t funded.

Still, the governor’s office confirmed support for a bipartisan tax cut proposal in January, and again in February when Christie said during his budget speech that New Jerseyans are overtaxed and deserve a tax cut.

""But, if you change your mind and concur with my conditional veto, my Administration will figure out how to pay for this long overdue tax relief,"" he told the Legislature. ""If you do not, I am content to let the voters decide this in November.""

The key difference is that Gov. Christie supported a tax cut and Sweeney's plan called for tax credits. So that's not an endorsement, said David Turner, a spokesman for the Buono campaign.

""In the end, you propose the tax cut you want,"" Turner said. ""The Governor proposed his and just because there was a Democratic legislature there to stop him does not erase the original proposal. Moreover, he was doing radio commercials in a Republican State Committee radio spot despite saying that he supported the Sweeney plan. That does not qualify as an endorsement, despite the fact that he masquerades as that.""

Our ruling

Buono said in a recent television interview, ""Governor Christie, his idea of jumpstarting the economy is to propose a trickle-down income tax cut last year and in his budget address this year, he stated his support for it again.""

Christie did propose a tax cut in January 2012 but dropped that idea six months later to support one proposed by Democrats that would result in an income tax credit on property taxes. The plan never went anywhere, however, because Christie’s revenue projections didn’t meet their target and Democrats said the state couldn’t afford the cut.

Accordingly, Buono is correct that Christie proposed a tax cut last year and also expressed support in his February budget address for a cut. But as she has done in a past fact check related to this claim, Buono leaves out that the governor dropped his original proposal in favor of a Democratic tax-cut plan that he has supported since July. That’s a critical fact that would give a different impression, and that meets our definition for Mostly False.

Kurt Schrader supports $85 billion sequester, but won't cut $1.6 million for video games?
","
Since just before the sequester set in March 1, the National Republican Congressional Committee has been filling email in-boxes in Oregon with allegations that U.S. Rep. Kurt Schrader has shirked his fiscal duties by siding with fellow Democrat, President Barack Obama.

An email from an NRCC spokeswoman had this subject line: ""Kurt Schrader’s priorities: A robotic squirrel."" That was followed by a press release sarcastically thanking Schrader for standing by while the government wastes money ""on frivolous programs like the production of a musical about climate change and a menu of foods people could eat on Mars – yes, the planet Mars.""

Those were followed by a limited-distribution online banner ad that reads: ""What?! Kurt Schrader supports Obama’s sequester … but won’t cut $1.6 million to fund new video games.""

By this point, PolitiFact Oregon can’t stop giggling. A musical about climate change? A robo-squirrel to pick up robo-nuts? A new menu of what we might eat on Mars, maybe while playing new video games? We were intrigued to find out more, even though we know that campaign blasts from the major parties tend to be over the top.

For those of you not keeping up with sequester news: A long, long time ago, Obama and Congress agreed to across-the-board federal cuts if they couldn’t agree on a more measured way to reduce spending and balance the budget. Well, guess what? They couldn’t agree -- Obama and Democrats want new revenue; Republicans do not -- so the country is in sequestration mode, with $85 billion in automatic cuts between now and Sept. 30, 2013.

Republicans are using the impasse to drum up public support for their cause and against Democrats. The National Republican Congressional Committee -- which is chaired by Oregon’s very own Rep. Greg Walden -- wants to take out Schrader in 2014. Other Democrats, including Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore, are being similarly targeted nationally.

Now that we have the background, let’s try to unwind the statement. Is it true that Schrader supports Obama’s sequester, but refuses to cut $1.6 million for video games?

According to an NRCC statement, Schrader voted for the sequestration bill, and voted against legislation that would have replaced it. That’s accurate-ish. Schrader joined his party in voting against two GOP-backed bills last year that would have replaced the across-the-board cuts with deep cuts to entitlements and social programs.  

But let’s not forget this: The 2011 bill creating the sequester law was backed by 174 Republicans, including Walden, Majority Leader Eric Cantor and House Speaker John Boehner. To single out Schrader -- and other potentially vulnerable Democrats -- as supporting the sequester ignores an awful lot of Republicans who voted for the sequester bill, and blames Democrats for failing to vote for a replacement budget dictated by Republicans.

Now on to the fun stuff.

All four items highlighted by the NRCC come from the annual ""Wastebook"" put out by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-OK. His office identified about $18 billion worth of wasted -- in his opinion -- tax dollars in 2012. The programs are included regardless of home state or party backing.

For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is spending about $1 million a year -- out of a $17 billion budget -- to develop food items for a 2-1/2-year trip to Mars in the 2030s.

The robo-squirrel reference comes from a $325,000 National Science Foundation grant to researchers in California who are studying how a robot squirrel might fake out a non-robot rattlesnake. A New York City-based theater also received nearly $700,000 from the NSF to create a musical about climate change and biodiversity.

And, finally, NASA is spending $1.6 million to develop video games and other entertainment as a way to get more students interested in science, math and technology.

The point being made by House Republicans is obvious: The White House need not furlough airport security workers when there are so many other places to cut.

Yet $18 billion plucked from a ""waste book"" is not close to $85 billion. And, seriously, Congress doesn’t go back and comb through individual budgets and kill off low-level programs a senator deems frivolous. The broader NSF and NASA budgets were approved by both Republicans and Democrats. There is no either-this-or-that choice to make in the here-and-now, and to suggest that Democrats could cut a Mars-related project for more airport securityis misleading.

Certainly Republicans are making a valid point that the two sides could make targeted, intelligent reductions, but that’s not the hang-up in the standoff. The hang-up is over money. Republicans do not want to raise taxes.  

In a response to PolitiFact Oregon, NRCC spokeswoman Alleigh Marré said that Schrader voted twice against sequester replacementbills. Did those bills, we asked, include a line item reduction of $1.6 million for NASA’s video games? The response: No, they did not.

In case you’re wondering, Schrader’s office declined to comment on how the congressman truly feels about video game development, Mars food items and other spending choices mocked in the Wastebook. His office says he opposes the sequestration as bad policy that doesn’t address long-term cost drivers, like health care.

Of course he does. We can’t think of anyone who thinks across-the-board cuts is a good way to budget. And despite the NRCC’s assertion that this is Obama’s sequester, PolitiFact has ruled that the sequester is the baby of both parties. (And no, Obama can’t blame Congress either.)

The NRCC’s online ad states: ""Kurt Schrader supports Obama’s sequester … but won’t cut $1.6 million to fund new video games.""The statement is inaccurate in many ways. This is not Obama’s sequester, as PolitiFact has ruled. Schrader voted for the 2011 bill authorizing sequestration, along  with many Republicans. He voted against two sequestration bills pushed by Republicans that would have sheltered defense at the expense of human services and entitlement programs.

Neither of those bills included a line item calling for $1.6 million to be taken out of NASA’s budget for video games. Schrader was not in a position to cut -- or to not cut -- that money with his sequestration-related votes. Clearly the ads are meant to showcase extreme examples of budget fat. But in doing so, the NRCC has jumped into spacey nonsense. We find the claim not only false, but ridiculously so.

Rhode Island Rep. Christopher Blazejewski says 32 states, District of Columbia allow early voting
","
Long slogs at polling places have led many states to allow voters to cast ballots before Election Day. Early voting is supposed to lead to shorter lines on Election Day and encourage more people to vote.

State Rep. Christopher R. Blazejewski, D-Providence, has submitted a bill that would allow early voting in Rhode Island.

Blazejewski’s bill would allow people to vote in person at locations that would be determined by local elections boards. The early voting period would start 21 days before a general election. Early voting would conclude the Saturday before Election Day. There would be no early voting during special elections.

For a primary, the early voting period would start 13 days before Election Day and conclude the Saturday before. The early votes would not be counted until the polls close.  

Blazejewski said early voting would better suit voters’ schedules, providing more hours to vote, including weekends.

In an interview, he said the right to vote is fundamental for a democracy and that early voting broadens people’s access to the polls. He cited long lines at the polls in Providence during the November 2012 election, including waits of more than three hours at the Juanita Sanchez Complex polling place.

In a news release, Blazejewski said: ""In 32 other states and Washington D.C., they [voters] can avoid the wait by voting before Election Day.""

Do that many states let people vote early? We contacted Blazejewski and ultimately heard from Larry Berman, House spokesman, who said the lawmaker’s source was the National Conference of State Legislatures.

PolitiFact Rhode Island had already been checking around, including the National Conference of State Legislatures’ website.

The site does indeed list the 32 states, and the District of Columbia, as allowing early in-person voting as of Sept. 4. In those places, ""any qualified voter may cast a ballot in person during a designated period prior to election day"" with ""no excuse or justification"" required to vote early, the NCSL says.

Two other states -- Washington and Oregon -- have voting only by mail.

Wendy Underhill, a senior policy specialist with the NCSL, said in an interview that the number of states with early voting has not changed since September.  

Some states allow voting as early as 45 days before the election and as late as the Friday before the election. Average starting time for early voting in the 32 states was 22 days prior to the Election Day.

Our ruling

State Rep. Christopher R. Blazejewski, D-Providence, said: ""In 32 other states and Washington D.C., they [voters] can avoid the wait by voting before Election Day.""

The National Conference of State Legislatures’ figures support Blazejewski’s statement as far as in-person voting and we could find no other figures that showed a lower tally. There are two other states that have all mail-in voting

We rate the statement True.

Chris Smith says Florida No. 2 in uninsured
","
Florida Democratic Senate leader Chris Smith of Fort Lauderdale has found himself in unfamiliar territory lately: agreeing with Republican Gov. Rick Scott.

""Medicaid expansion, Obamacare, teacher raises. Who is this guy?"" Smith tweeted on Feb. 21 in response to Scott’s announcements that he would support Medicaid expansion and raises for teachers.

Flash forward to March 5, when Scott gave his annual State of the State address. The former state budget slayer and foe of Obamacare gave a speech in which he called for helping the poor, the disabled and teachers.

So how does a Democratic leader -- whose role is to attack the Republican Scott -- respond? By telling voters that while the Democrats believe Scott is now on the right track in some areas, the state still has far to go to help the middle class and the poor.

Smith’s speech criticized Scott’s past education funding record and called for Scott to give state workers a raise, protect the environment and undo past changes to Florida elections law that contributed to long lines in November.

Smith also called on Scott to work with the Legislature to ensure that it supports Medicaid expansion, despite opposition in the House. Scott announced his support for the expansion in February, but has said it isn’t one of his top priorities. Expanding Medicaid would give health care coverage to more of the poorest Floridians. Currently, the program is restricted to children, the elderly, the disabled and pregnant women.

""We ask for you to provide true leadership, work with the Legislature and make sure that the House goes on with our Medicaid expansion. We are second in the nation in the uninsured. We need to make sure we expand Medicaid and use the federal dollars that will help our state budget,"" Smith said.

Is Florida No. 2 in the nation for uninsured?

Research ranking the number of uninsured

We found there are a couple of different ways to account for the uninsured among the states.

A spokeswoman for Smith cited an August 2012 article in the Huffington Post that ranked Florida at No. 2 in its share of uninsured residents based on 2010 U.S. Census data. Texas came in first with 26.3 percent, followed by Florida at 25.3 percent, and Nevada at 25.1 percent.

The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation keeps track of state health facts and also draws on research from the U.S. Census Bureau. Kaiser examines state populations up to age 64, since people who are 65 and older can get Medicare.

By that ranking, the states with the highest percentages of uninsured in 2010-11 were Texas (27 percent) followed by Nevada (25 percent). For third,  Kaiser showed a tie between New Mexico and Florida, but Florida was a pinch higher at 24.18 percent compared with 23.85 percent for New Mexico.

When looking at only the sheer number of uninsured under the age of 65, Florida was third place with 3.7 million, behind California (7.1 million) and Texas (6.1 million). 
Finally, the polling organization Gallup interviews residents nationwide about their insurance. A 2011 Gallup poll placed Florida in third for its percentage of uninsured, at 22.9 percent,  behind Texas (27.6 percent) and Mississippi (23.5 percent).

Why Florida’s rate is so high

Smith’s claim about Florida’s high uninsured rate raises questions about why it is so high. John Rother, President and CEO, of the National Coalition on Health Care, which supports health care reform, sent us a list of seven reasons:

• The state has many small and low-wage employers who do not offer insurance.
• Florida has many seasonal workers who tend to be uninsured.
• Florida attracts many pre-Medicare retirees who have lost their workplace coverage but are not yet old enough for Medicare.
• Many with pre-existing conditions cannot get coverage.
• South Florida is an especially high-cost area in terms of medical claims.
• The state has relatively weak and underfunded safety net programs for the uninsured.
• Immigrants have a particularly hard time obtaining insurance due to paperwork requirements.

Our ruling

Sen. Chris Smith said ""We are second in nation in the uninsured.""

There are different ways to measure the uninsured. In terms of sheer numbers, Florida is third.

We found the most useful measure is to count Floridians under the age of 65, which includes only those not eligible for Medicare. That measure shows the state in third place in the percentage of uninsured, after first place Texas and second place Nevada.

Smith is slightly off on his numbers, but his point is on solid ground. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/08/christopher-l-smith/chris-smith-says-florida-no-2-uninsured/

McDonnell does a full flop on not raising taxes
","
For better or worse, Gov. Bob McDonnell will be remembered for helping convince the General Assembly this winter to pass Virginia’s first major package of new transportation funding in 27 years.

Supporters say the legislation -- which will eventually raise at least $880 million a year, mostly from new taxes and fees --  will pay for road building and maintenance projects that are vital to Virginia’s economy and quality of life. McDonnell heralded its passage on Feb. 23 as ""a historic day in Virginia.""

But a group of conservatives still hoping to stop the plan is accusing McDonnell of breaking a 2009 campaign commitment to not raise taxes. The opponents include bloggers at Americans for Tax Reform, Bearing Drift, and Jamie Radtke, a Virginia tea party organizer who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate last year.

Radtke has started a Facebook page, urging the governor to veto the plan he says he supports. She has written an online editorial accusing McDonnell of flip-flopping on taxes. ""It is important to juxtapose Gov. McDonnell’s support of this massive tax increase with his rhetoric of the past,"" she wrote.

Has McDonnell changed his position on increasing taxes for roads? We decided to submit the question to our Flip-O-Meter.

Let’s start by traveling back to the 2009 campaign. McDonnell -- despite coaxing from Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform -- did not sign a pledge to oppose all tax increases. But he made it clear that he rejected raising levies. 
That July, he issued a transportation plan that criticized then-Gov. Tim Kaine’s administration  of  ""being so wedded to funding new transportation investments solely through new taxes that it has dragged its feet on several viable alternatives.""

McDonnell proposed raising money for roads without increasing taxes by privatizing the state’s liquor stores and issuing bonds. He also wanted to dedicate to transportation a portion of annual revenue growth and budget surpluses, and all money that would come to the state if the White House allowed drilling for oil and natural gas off Virginia’s coast.

Critics said McDonnell’s created a few windfalls for transportation but failed to tap a reliable new stream of funding to build and maintain roads over the long run.

That August, the Associated Press interviewed McDonnell for an hour and quoted him as saying, ""Any general increase in the taxes of Virginia I’m not going to support. I’m not planning to raise taxes. That’s the best I can tell you.""

On Sept. 11, 2009 -- as Radtke notes on her website -- McDonnell was interviewed on WTOP radio in Washington. ""So, no tax will be raised during your four-year term?"" the host, Mark Plotkin, asked.

""I’m going to be able to find other ways to fund transportation,"" McDonnell replied.

Two newspapers reported that McDonnell pledged not to raise taxes during a Sept. 17, 2009, debate against his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Creigh Deeds of Bath County.

""McDonnell said he would not raise taxes as governor,"" said an article the next day in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. ""After the debate, he said he would not sign a transportation bill submitted to him by the legislature if it included any tax increase.""

The Roanoke Times reported, ""McDonnell insisted he would not raise taxes.""

McDonnell emphasized that message by launching a TV commercial on Oct. 2 in which he spoke of the need to improve roads. ""My plan: New money for transportation, while protecting education and not raising taxes,"" he said.

Four days later, McDonnell aired another TV ad assailing Deeds for supporting a gas tax increase to pay for roads. ""Creigh Deeds has unequivocally committed himself to higher taxes,"" the announcer said. ""...His $1 billion tax increase would add 20 cents to a gallon of gas.""

Now, let’s return to 2013. On. Jan. 9, McDonnell proposed a plan to raise $640 million a year for transportation. He called for eliminating the 17.5-cents-per-gallon excise tax on gasoline and increasing the state’s 5 percent sales tax to 5.8 percent. The governor also wanted to raise the motor vehicle registration fee and create a fee for alternative fuel vehicles.

The proposal was extensively amended by the General Assembly. On Feb. 23, lawmakers passed a bipartisan deal that would raise $880 million a year -- about $680 million of which would come from tax increases.

The legislation would replace the per-gallon excise levy with a 3.5 percent tax on gasoline and 6 percent diesel tax at the wholesale level, raise the state sales tax to 5.3 percent and increase the 3 percent motor vehicle sales tax to 4.3 percent.

In addition, Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads would be empowered to impose a 0.7 percent local sales tax and other regional levies that could raise $558 million a year for transportation.

McDonnell has yet to sign the bill. But he has expressed his strong support, saying the legislation ""fixed the problem"" of sufficiently funding transportation and thanking lawmakers who voted for it.

What explains the governor’s change of heart?

Tucker Martin, the governor’s chief of communications, said transportation problems were worsening and McDonnell ran out of options, short of general tax increases, to fix them. Martin noted in an email that two of McDonnell’s proposals to raise money for roads failed: the General Assembly had no desire to sell state liquor stores and the White House did not approve offshore drilling in Virginia.

Martin mentioned other steps McDonnell took to spur road building prior to this year. The governor audited the Virginia Department of Transportation and found $1 billion in unspent money about about $400 million in efficiencies that were redirected to road projects. Virginia has issued more than $1.7 billion in transportation bonds since McDonnell took office. The state is selling sponsorships and naming rights for roads.

""None of those actions were enough,"" Martin wrote. He noted that a 2012 study by the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University found that the Northern Virginia-Washington region has the worst traffic congestion in the nation. Hampton Roads was ranked the 20th worst.

Martin said the governor became increasingly concerned that the congestion ""was negatively impacting Virginia’s economic competitiveness."" McDonnell’s aversion to tax increases, Martin wrote, took a backseat to another campaign pledge.

""The governor’s foremost campaign promise was to do everything in his power to help the private sector create good-paying jobs for our citizens,"" he said. ""...Virginians won’t find good jobs without a 21st century transportation system that will help job creators.""

We should note that the last two Virginia governors to sign major tax increases, Democrats Gerald Baliles in 1986 and Mark Warner in 2004, promised during their campaigns that they would not increase levies.  

The record shows McDonnell, too, changed his position on not raising taxes. Some may applaud him for bold leadership, others may criticize him for breaking faith. We won’t enter that debate. Our goal is to document his record and, in this instance, he did a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2013/mar/08/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-does-full-flop-not-raising-taxes/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Debbie Wasserman Schultz']","
Has Jeb Bush flip-flopped on immigration and a pathway to citizenship?
","
Jeb Bush was for it before he was against it.

And now he’s for it again?

That’s the refrain these days on where the former Florida governor stands on creating a process for people in the U.S. illegally to eventually become American citizens -- or something secondary to that, such as legal residents. Since his new book Immigration Wars was released this week, Bush has been accused of changing position.

""@JebBush a flip-flop-flip on immigration? Wow. I fashioned you more of a baseball player than a gymnast. My bad. #notsurprisedatall,"" Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz quipped in a tweet on March 5, 2013.

Bush, 60, has enjoyed distinction as an elder statesman in the Republican party since leaving elected office in 2007. But with the release of his book, Bush has indicated he’s considering a future presidential run (""I’m not saying yes, I’m just not saying no,"" he told MSNBC).

We found that Bush, now a definite maybe for 2016, has indeed said conflicting things over time about eventual citizenship for illegal immigrants.

 ‘Start deporting people’

Bush, a Texas native who calls Florida his adopted home state, plunged into politics in 1994 with a run to unseat Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles.

Back then, there was virtually no talk of turning millions of illegal immigrants in the U.S. into citizens. When asked what to do with them, Bush had one word: deportation.

In an interview with the Miami Herald, he was asked, ""There are something like 4 million illegals in the United States . . . . What would you do with the ones that are here?""

""Start deporting people,"" he answered. ""We have an asylum process . . . . It shouldn't take five years. We need to reform our system. ... I don't blame them for wanting to come to our country, but I don't believe it's necessarily our responsibility to allow them to come in.""

But he also made it clear he was not in favor of closing the border. ""I believe in open, legal immigration,"" Bush said.

He lost that election, but stormed back four years later and won the governor’s race.

By 2006, Bush was well-established as Florida’s chief executive, and he wasn’t afraid to criticize members of his own party. His views, it seems, had evolved beyond ""start deporting people.""

In an email exchange with the Los Angeles Times that year, Bush weighed in with support for proposed federal immigration reform legislation, calling it ""just plain wrong"" to charge illegal immigrants with a felony and opposed ""penalizing the children of illegal immigrants"" by denying them U.S. citizenship.

He endorsed the idea of a broad guest-worker program, but the Los Angeles Times noted then that he ""offered no specificity on how to treat current immigrants and whether they should be granted a path to citizenship.""

In 2009, Bush co-chaired a bipartisan task force for the Council on Foreign Relations, which studied immigration challenges and came up with a set of proposals. In an interview about the group’s recommendations, Bush said that if reform doesn’t happen, ""we ignore an issue that needs to be solved, which is what do we do with people who are here permanently, who have made contributions, who if given a path to citizenship would do what's right and take the necessary steps to achieve legalized status and citizenship.""

However, in a separate op-ed about the task force recommendations, Bush simply said reform should include ""a fair and orderly way to allow many of those currently living here illegally to earn the right to remain legally.""

2012: Bush stakes his position

Last year, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney declared that he would pursue an immigration policy so austere that illegal immigrants would self-deport -- a position later faulted for Republicans’ poor showing among Hispanic voters.

Bush, meanwhile, continued his call for more welcoming rhetoric and a ""broader approach"" to legislation that dealt with issues beyond border security and cracking down on illegal migration. In an interview last summer with Charlie Rose, he made a clear declaration that he favored citizenship.

""You have to deal with this issue. You can’t ignore it. And so, either a path to citizenship, which I would support and that does put me probably out of the mainstream of most conservatives; Or a path to legalization, a path to residency of some kind,"" he said.

Fast forward past the election. It’s now 2013, and Republicans are smarting from their losses and pledging to remake their platform into one that appeals more to Hispanics and other minorities. A bipartisan group of Senators is working on reform legislation that includes citizenship.

But Bush’s book, which reportedly went to the printer in late 2012, split the concepts of citizenship and legal residency. And in print, Bush opposed citizenship and instead proposed ""a path to permanent legal resident status.""

""Permanent residency in this context, however, should not lead to citizenship. It is absolutely vital to the integrity of our immigration system that actions have consequences — in this case, that those who violated the laws can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship. ... A grant of citizenship is an undeserving reward for conduct that we cannot afford to encourage.""

Illegal immigrants, he and co-author Clint Bolick wrote, could return to their homeland and apply for citizenship through regular channels.

After immediately catching heat over the book -- and how it conflicts with his past position -- Bush began softening up.

""We wrote this book last year, not this year, and we proposed a path to legalization, so anybody that had come illegally would have immediately a path to legalization,"" Bush said on MSNBC.

He added: ""If you can craft that in law, where you can have a path to citizenship where there isn’t an incentive for people to come illegally, I’m for it. I don’t have a problem with that.""

He told CNN: ""I have supported both — both a path to legalization or a path to citizenship — with the underlying principle being that there should be no incentive for people to come illegally at the expense of coming legally.""

Jaryn Emhof, Bush’s communications director, told PolitiFact in an email, ""The book outlines a proposal by which immigrants -- whether they are coming to work temporarily, to go to school, to live and work as permanent residents or seeking citizenship -- can do so through an immigration process that would be much more open than before. So, it is talking about future immigrants, not those currently here illegally.""

We think it’s clear, however, that the book’s passages about legal status vs. citizenship very clearly refer to those already here.

Our ruling

Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- admittedly a bit player in this story but for her tweet -- said Bush has made a ""flip-flop-flip"" on immigration.

Here’s a quick chronology:

• Early in his political life, Bush expressed a hard-line, deportation-driven opinion and made no mention of granting citizenship or legal status to illegal immigrants.

• Sometime between 2009 and 2012, he ""flipped"" to being in favor of a path to citizenship. He supported federal legislation in 2007 that allowed children of illegal immigrants to become citizens, and wrote frequently that Republicans should adopt a more welcoming approach. In June 2012, he clearly articulated support for a pathway to citizenship.

• His ""flop"" came this month with the release of his book, in which he explicitly opposed citizenship, calling it an ""undeserving reward"" for people who came here illegally.

• That was followed by a quick ""flip"" back to support of either citizenship or permanent legal status in the heat of television interviews.

Over the years Bush has said he favored citizenship or legal residency, demonstrating openness to proposals that could be considered within a wider reform effort. So at times he has embraced both, or either one.

There’s no doubt, though, that the Jeb Bush in the book had a different opinion from the Jeb Bush on the book tour. We rate the flip-flop-flip claim True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/08/debbie-wasserman-schultz/jeb-bush-flip-flop-immigration-pathway-citizenship/
"['Health Care', 'Public Health', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
In wake of mass shootings, Scott Walker says half of Wisconsin adults with ""serious psychological distress"" don't get care
","
In the wake of mass shootings in Wisconsin and around the country, it may have been alarming to hear Gov. Scott Walker explain why he proposed more spending for mental health care in his 2013-2015 budget. 
""Nationally, serious mental illness costs at least $193 billion a year in lost earnings,"" Walker said during his Feb. 20, 2013, budget presentation. ""In Wisconsin, only half of all the adults with serious psychological distress received mental health treatment or medication.""

In the course of his remarks, Walker used two different terms -- ""serious mental illness"" and ""serious psychological distress."" He used the second to illustrate lack of care.

Is he correct that only half of Wisconsin adults with ""serious psychological distress"" receive care?

Backdrop: mass shootings

Walker didn’t mention mass shootings in his budget address, but he alluded to them two weeks earlier when he revealed his plan to boost mental health spending by $29 million over two years.

The National Alliance on Mental Illness Wisconsin praised the spending boost, which would be done from several different pots of money.But the advocacy group said Walker’s rejection of a federal proposal to expand Medicaid ""reflects a shallow understanding"" of ""crucial means to affordable mental health care for Wisconsin residents.""

In revealing his plans, the governor stopped short of drawing a clear link between treating mental illness and preventing mass shootings, but indicated his plan took on greater urgency after mass killings in 2012.

Those incidents included the shooting deaths of six worshippers at a Sikh temple outside of Milwaukee and of 26 children and adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

To be clear, only about 1 percent of people with mental illness considered to be severe are regarded as dangerous. But a 2011 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report found that this group can pose a dilemma for policy-makers, who lack the data to develop a sound system for dealing with it. 
Walker’s budget, which could be modified by the Legislature, includes $12.6 million to treat more patients who have been committed to mental hospitals, $10.2 million to expand community-based care programs for people with severe mental illness and $3.8 million for more coordination of care for children with behavioral issues. 
Walker’s evidence 
When we asked Walker’s office for evidence to back his claim, we were initially referred to a January 2013 report by his Department of Health Services. The report estimated, based on a federal survey of American adults, that in 2011, 49 percent of the 1 million adults in Wisconsin who had ""any mental illness"" did not get treatment. 
Any mental illness refers to people who have a ""diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder."" The disorder causes impairment -- ranging from mild to moderate to substantial -- in carrying out major life activities. 
The 49 percent figure cited in the health department’s report might appear to support Walker’s claim. 
But his claim about Wisconsin didn’t use the term mental illness. It used the phrase ""serious psychological distress."" 
We pointed out the difference to Stephanie Smiley, spokeswoman for the department. She then cited federal survey data showing that over a two-year period -- 2010 to 2011 -- an estimated 51 percent of Wisconsin adults with ""serious psychological distress"" did not get treatment in the previous year. 
(She also said that in 2008-2009, 31 percent of state adults with serious mental illness got treatment.) 
So, the 51 percent figure about serious psychological distress appears to back Walker’s claim. 
But let’s understand serious psychological distress as compared to serious mental illness, given that mental illness was the focus of Walker’s comments and his proposed spending increase. 
Other evidence 
Based on definitions pertaining to adults from the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which oversees the surveys Walker cited: there are differences between serious mental illness -- the first term Walker used in his budget speech -- and serious psychological distress, which he mentioned second. 
Serious mental illness refers to a ""diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder"" that involves substantial impairment in carrying out major life activities. 
Serious psychological distress refers to how a person responds to six questions in a federal survey about whether they feel nervous, hopeless, restless or fidgety, sad or depressed, ""that everything was an effort"" and ""no good or worthless."" 
Experts we consulted said that serious mental illness was a more precise term used to identify a person after thorough diagnosis and that serious psychological distress was an intentionally vague term used by researchers doing surveys. 
""It kind of casts a wider net,"" Annabelle Potvin of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Wisconsin said of the serious psychological distress term, which she said indicates a need for a person to get a mental health assessment.   
Serious psychological distress can encompass people anywhere on a scale from mild to serious mental illness, but tends to be lower on the scale. That’s according to the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Tim Connor, who evaluates mental health programs across the state; and Walter Laux, behavioral health division director of Community Advocates, a Milwaukee-based nonprofit agency. 
Indeed, the state Department of Health Services, in a 2010 report, also made a distinction. 
Serious psychological distress is a ""non-specific category of distress"" characterized by a ""mood or anxiety disorder and a lesser degree of functional impairment than serious mental illness."" It is considered to be ""an indicator of possible serious mental illness, with similar but less strict inclusion criteria.""

In other words, people with serious psychological distress might have mental illness, but that distress is generally regarded as lower on a scale than serious mental illness.

Our rating 
After making a reference to serious mental illness, Walker said: ""In Wisconsin, only half of all the adults with serious psychological distress received mental health treatment or medication."" 
Strictly speaking, Walker’s statistical claim is accurate, at least based on estimates derived from a federal survey. 
But his statement needs clarification, given that people with serious psychological distress may have mental illness, but have not been diagnosed as being mentally ill.

Would new stadium be cheaper than a Dome rehab? Depends
","
To build new or to renovate the old?

PolitiFact Georgia has examined the question before in the case of the proposed $1 billion Falcons stadium. The issue then was a claim by Atlanta’s chief operating officer about how much upfront public money is typically invested in these types of projects.

The debate continues. This time we examine a claim made by Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed about construction costs.

Reed, a staunch supporter of a new stadium, has said that renovating the 21-year-old Georgia Dome, where the Falcons currently play, is a bad idea. Reed said the renovation would cost more than the upfront public funding portion of a new stadium.

Reed says the Dome would need up to $350 million in work over the next five to seven years, based on information from the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, the Dome’s owner.

Politifact Georgia decided to investigate  the estimates for a renovated Georgia Dome. We wanted to know how those renovations compare with construction of a new stadium.

Under the deal that was reached this week, the Falcons would contribute $800 million toward the proposed $1 billion stadium. Team owner Arthur Blank sits on the board of directors of Cox Enterprises, which owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

The publicly funded portion of the new retractable-roof stadium would be $200 million in bonds issued by the city and backed by hotel-motel tax revenue. The Falcons would assume responsibility for $50 million in infrastructure costs. The Blank Family Foundation would invest $15 million in projects for neighborhoods around the stadium; the city’s economic development agency would commit another $15 million. The deal also calls for at least 31 percent minority and women business participation in the design and construction work. The Atlanta City Council would have to approve a funding deal.

The Falcons want a new stadium in time for the 2017 football season, when their lease expires at the Georgia Dome.

PolitiFact Georgia asked Reed’s office about his source for the renovation figures. It pointed us to a 2010 master plan study of the Dome commissioned by the GWCCA. That study examined what a new NFL stadium program would look like and the costs for getting the Dome to that level.

That study included the following expanded/renovated Dome budget:

New additional area:    $118,100,000 (369,000 square feet)
Major renovation:         $145,600,000
Minor renovation:         $ 23,200,000
Seating Bowl/Field:          $ 25,000,000
Replace Roof Fabric:                 $ 30,000,000
Soft Costs, fees, etc (15%):    $ 51,300,000
Total:                 $393,200,000

The total does not include year-to-year cost increases, parking lots and garages, or land. It also does not include an optional $200 million retractable roof.

The commissioned studies were completed by Kansas City, Mo.-based Populous, one of the largest stadium builders in the nation. The company is now a finalist in the GWCCA’s selection process for a lead architect. Populous was not asked to itemize specific work under the ""major"" and ""minor"" renovation categories, said a spokeswoman representing the GWCCA.

With updated features and arrangements, the study allows for a seating capacity of 65,000 seats with the possibility for expansion to 75,000 seats.The Georgia Dome currently has 71,250 seats

Another GWCCA-commissioned report, released in February 2011, focused on a new open-air stadium, but it also examined continued maintenance and improvements at the Georgia Dome over the next 20 years. That study found that from 2011 to 2020, $44.5 million in maintenance work would be needed to retain the Dome at ""today’s level of quality. An additional $35 million to $70 million in capital improvements -- such as a new roof, plumbing and technology upgrades and food service equipment -- would also be needed during the same time period to keep the Dome a competitive venue over the next decade, the report said.

Over the past 16 years, combined maintenance projects and improvement projects at the Dome have equaled $71,430,000, according to the report.

Initially, the 2010 budget document sent to us from the mayor’s office and included in the 2010 report listed an incorrect figure for a cost sub total. Politifact Georgia caught the error while doing our own math on the numbers, and Populous revised the document.

Depending on your assumptions, it’s easy to inflate the costs of an old facility, said Neil deMause, an author and blogger who monitors -- and has been critical of -- sports facility deals across the country.

""Are your stated costs just to maintain (the facility), doing some upgrades or completely gutting it and making it look like a new facility?"" he said. ""The Falcons are playing in the Dome now, and it doesn’t look like it’s falling down. Could you spend less than $100 million and upgrade it? I don’t know, nobody has asked that question.""

The argument for stadium upgrades across the nation has been met with mixed results lately.

As part of a stadium extension deal approved late last year, the Buffalo Bills will receive $94 million in public funds as part of a $130 million renovation. This week, North Carolina’s governor denied the use of public money for renovation of the Carolina Panthers’ Bank of America Stadium. The team had asked for $62.5 million as part of a $250 million renovation deal. Also this week, senators in Miami are proposing a referendum be approved before hotel-motel taxes are used to fund renovations at the Dolphins’ stadium. And although arbitrators sided last month with the St. Louis Rams for $700 million in renovations at the Edward Jones Dome, some officials think the money would be better spent on a new facility.

Rodney Fort, co-director of the University of Michigan’s Center for Sports Management said the idea a stadium renovation would be more expensive than building a new facility is difficult to contemplate. But if you cannot get the same flow of value no matter how you renovate, then you’re comparing apples to oranges, he said.

Ultimately, we return to the original question: To build new or to renovate?

The mayor says the (Georgia) Dome would need up to $350 million in work over the next five to seven years. That amount is more than the cost of the upfront public money ($200 million) that could be needed for a proposed $1 billion Falcons stadium.

Reed cites figures from a 2010 study that puts the Dome’s renovation costs at about $393 million. Those renovations would include 369,000 square feet of additional space, a roof replacement and upgrades to the seating bowl/field area. Using these figures, the renovations would be more than the $200 million public investment in the proposed deal for a new stadium.

A study the following year, completed by the same company, lists maintenance and capital costs to keep the Dome at ""today’s"" levels between $79.5 million and $114.5 million. Those costs would include basic renovation items such as technology and plumbing upgrades, along with a new roof. Using these figures, the renovation cost would be less than the $200 million public investment into the proposed new stadium deal.

The difference lies with which style of renovations is chosen: the exclusive Rolls-Royce level of renovations or the cheaper, base model Honda level of renovations.

Reed’s statement is partially accurate but needs a lot of additional information and context.

We rated the statement Half True.

Sen. Rand Paul says Obama 'is advocating a drone strike program in America'
","
Sen. Rand Paul’s filibuster on March 6, 2013, expanded from the Senate floor to Twitter, where he, among other things, accused President Barack Obama of ""advocating a drone strike program in America.""

The Republican from Kentucky spoke for nearly 13 hours until the early morning on March 7 to keep senators from voting on the nomination of White House counterterrorism chief John Brennan for CIA director.

The subject of Paul’s concern: a letter from the attorney general that didn’t appear to rule out drone strikes against U.S. citizens on American soil.

""No American should be killed by a drone on American soil without first being charged with a crime, without first being found to be guilty by a court,"" Paul said.

By mid afternoon March 7, the attorney general released a new letter clarifying the administration's stance, Paul declared victory, and the Senate voted to confirm Brennan, 63 to 34. (Paul voted no.)

The Senate logjam may have broken, but we still wondered: Has President Barack Obama been ""advocating a drone strike program in America""?

 What the administration says

We asked Paul’s office to explain his tweet, but we didn’t hear back.

His full Twitter comment said: ""The President is advocating a drone strike program in America. All we have to compare it with is the drone strike program overseas.""

However, during his filibuster, Paul mentioned a March letter from Attorney General Eric Holder as well as testimony from Brennan’s February confirmation hearing.

The senator had sought the administration’s views on whether 'the president has the power to authorize lethal force, such as a drone strike, against a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil, and without trial.""

Armed drones — remote-controlled, pilotless aircraft — are used by the U.S. to kill enemies overseas, with hundreds of strikes in multiple countries in the last decade.

Brennan has said, ""In this armed conflict, individuals who are part of al-Qaida or its associated forces are legitimate military targets.""

In at least one case, the target was American.

Paul wanted assurance that strikes wouldn’t be made against Americans in the United States.

On March 4, Holder responded to Paul, writing that the United States hadn’t carried out such drone strikes and did not intend to.

""As a policy matter, moreover, we reject the use of military force where well-established law enforcement authorities in this country provide the best means for incapacitating a terrorist threat,"" Holder wrote.

But, Holder wrote, he could ""imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States.""

""For example,"" he continued, ""the President could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the military to use such force if necessary to protect the homeland in the circumstances of a catastrophic attack like the ones suffered on December 7, 1941, and September 11, 2001.

""Were such an emergency to arise, I would examine the particular facts and circumstances before advising the President on the scope of his authority.""

Brennan had offered a similar explanation in response to lawmakers’ questions before his February hearing.

A senator had asked, ""Could the administration carry out drone strikes inside the United States?""

Brennan’s reply: ""This administration has not carried out drone strikes inside the United States and has no intention of doing so.""

(Note that he did not say whether it ""could,"" only that it hadn’t and didn’t intend to.)

Asked to describe the ""geographical limits"" on the administration’s drone strikes, Brennan noted, in part, ""the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens from these attacks, and, thus, as the attorney general has noted, ‘neither Congress nor our federal courts has limited the geographic scope of our ability to use force to the current conflict in Afghanistan.’""

But he went on to say: ""This does not mean, however, that we use military force whenever or wherever we want. International legal principles, such as respect for another nation’s sovereignty, constrain our ability to act unilaterally. Using force in another country is consistent with these international legal principles if conducted, for example, with the consent of the relevant nation – or if or when other governments are unwilling or unable to deal effectively with a threat to the United States.""

We asked the White House for its response to Paul’s assertion that the president was ""advocating a drone strike program in America.""

""On the record, that claim is false,"" said Caitlin Hayden, spokesperson for the National Security Council.

She also pointed to Brennan’s speeches and nomination testimony, as well as letters by Holder.

We reviewed earlier Brennan speeches — such as the one in which he acknowledged the government’s overseas drone program — as well as speeches and news briefings by Obama and his press secretaries Robert Gibbs and Jay Carney.

We found nothing to indicate the administration was ""advocating"" domestic drone strikes. The most direct statements we saw from the administration on the idea of domestic drone strikes came from Brennan’s nomination testimony and Holder’s letters.

Holder’s second letter to Paul, the day after his filibuster and tweet, said:

""It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: 'Does the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?' The answer to that question is no.""

(Paul declared the statement ""a major victory,"" though it doesn’t address what authority the administration claims against citizens on U.S. soil it deems to be a ""legitimate military target."")

We also asked eight experts in drone-strike policy and law whether they thought Paul was correct that the Obama administration was ""advocating a drone strike program in America."" None of them did.

""Holder, in his testimony, said that in theory the administration could engage in a targeted killing in the U.S.,"" said Michael C. Dorf, a Cornell University Law School professor. ""But I don't think that counts as ‘advocating’"" such a program.

Steven Groves, a senior research fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, agreed, saying it was ""probably a stretch to say that the administration is ‘advocating’ a drone strike program in America"" when in fact Paul’s most immediate concern was that Holder would not rule out the use of drone strikes against Americans on U.S. soil. The statement, Grove said, ""may fairly be characterized as rhetorical flourishes.""

Paul Pillar, a veteran of the CIA who now teaches at Georgetown University, added that Paul’s statement ""does not fairly reflect the extreme and extraordinary nature of the hypothetical circumstance that the attorney general was addressing.""

Our ruling

Rand Paul tweeted that ""the president is advocating a drone strike program in America.""

The attorney general and White House counterterrorism chief haven’t strictly ruled out the use of lethal force against U.S. citizens on American soil, but they said that it would take extraordinary circumstances. We — and all the experts we consulted — see no evidence that the administration is purposefully advancing the goal of a drone strike program in America.

Rand Paul challenges Obama spokesman's comment on son of terrorist killed by drone strike
","
Sen. Rand Paul said a lot of things during his 13-hour filibuster of President Barack Obama’s nominee for CIA director. We’ll be checking several of his claims related to the Obama administration’s policy on drones, the unmanned aerial vehicles that can be used to track and kill almost anywhere.

One of the comments Paul made during his filibuster concerned the case of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki. He was the 16-year-old son of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric tied to al-Qaida who was killed in a drone strike. The killing of the elder al-Awlaki in September 2011 attracted widespread attention because it was an example of the U.S. government using drones to kill a U.S. citizen overseas.

The killing of his 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, on Oct. 14, 2011, is a lot less well-known. The younger al-Awlaki was reportedly killed two weeks after his father and was also an American citizen, born in Denver in 1995. Tom Junod of Esquire magazine wrote that ""there has been no similar public discussion over the death of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki because there was, until now, no hard information available about the death of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki. … The administration has neither acknowledged his death or acknowledged that it killed him.""

We won’t address in this article how Abdulrahman al-Awlaki was killed, whether a government drone strike was the cause, and how officials came to the decision to launch the strike, because we can’t independently confirm those facts. Instead, we’ll be looking at this more limited claim by Paul regarding the Obama camp’s discussion of the incident:

""When the president's spokesman was asked about al-Awlaki's son, you know what his response was? This I find particularly callous and particularly troubling. The president's response to the killing of al-Awlaki's son -- he said he should have chosen a more responsible father.""

The episode that Paul, a Kentucky Republican, referenced was a comment by former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs captured on video.

At the time, Gibbs was a spokesman for the Obama campaign, and the video was made in the ""spin room"" that was set up for campaign surrogates of Obama and Mitt Romney to brief reporters following the debate at Hofstra University.

In the video, Gibbs says, referring to the younger al-Awlaki, ""I would suggest that you should have a far more responsible father if they are truly concerned about the well being of their children. I don't think becoming an al-Qaida jihadist terrorist is the best way to go about doing your business.""

So Paul has some support for his claim. However, we think it’s worth adding a bit of context.

Gibbs did not go out of his way to make this comment; it was elicited by an activist group called We Are Change and two of its members, Luke Rudkowski and Sierra Adamson. The group released the video on YouTube on Oct. 23, 2012.

At the start of the three-and-a-half minute video, Rudkowski buttonholes Gibbs, who tries to brush off the inquiries -- four separate times by our count. The video then cuts to a different location in the spin room, as Gibbs is answering questions from a gaggle of reporters. Rudkowski fires a series of questions about how Obama justifies his ""secret kill list"" and targeting individuals ""without due process of law."" Gibbs fires back with talking points about the administration’s pledge to ""take the fight to al-Qaida.""

After an exchange of interruptions, Gibbs said, ""I think I know where you are on this issue. I’m just trying to answer your questions without you doing it … I’ll go to somebody who might want to listen to what I have to say.""

The case of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki came up when Adamson posed a question. ""Do you think that the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki’s 16-year-old son, who was an American citizen, was justifiable?""

Gibbs:  ""I’m not going to get into Anwar al-Awlaki’s son. I know that Anwar al-Awlaki renounced his citizenship --

Adamson: ""His son was still an American citizen.""

Gibbs: ""-- and did great harm to people in this country, and was a regional al-Qaida commander hoping to inflict harm and destruction on people that share his religion and others in this country.""

Adamson: ""But who was an American citizen that’s being targeted without due process of law, without trial, and he’s underage. He’s a minor.""

Only at this point did Gibbs say,  ""I would suggest that you should have a far more responsible father if they are truly concerned about the well being of their children. I don't think becoming an al-Qaida jihadist terrorist is the best way to go about doing your business.""

Then the video of Gibbs cuts out.

We were unable to reach Gibbs, or Paul, for comment. White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden told PolitiFact that the comments by Gibbs didn't, and do not, reflect the White House's view.

Our ruling

Paul said that ""when the president's spokesman was asked about (Anwar) al-Awlaki's son, … he said he should have chosen more responsible father."" Gibbs did say essentially that. But Paul’s use of Gibbs’ comment leaves out some important context. It was not a carefully crafted statement of White House policy. Rather, it came at the tail end of a contentious exchange with representatives of an activist group, a line of questioning that Gibbs repeatedly tried to brush off.

So while Paul is correct to say that Gibbs expressed that sentiment, the senator suggests that it’s more of an expression of White House policy than a full viewing of the video communicates. On balance, we rate Paul’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/07/rand-paul/rand-paul-challenges-obama-spokesmans-comment-son-/

State Rep. Dan Ramos says top earners would pay less and middle-class families would pay more under governor’s budget proposal
","
Gov. John Kasich’s proposed tax overhaul would affect the pocketbooks of all Ohioans – whether for good or for ill is a source of disagreement among state lawmakers.

The Republican governor’s plan aims to reduce income taxes for all Ohioans by 20 percent, shave down sales tax to 5 percent while broadening the sales-tax base to include previously tax-exempt services, and slash in half taxes on most small-business income. Kasich also wants to reform oil and gas severance taxes.

The tax plan is drummed up by Kasich’s administration as a victory for all Ohio taxpayers. But Rep. Dan Ramos, a Lorain Democrat, is among those who liken the budget proposal to a shell game only Ohio’s upper crust can win.

""Under [Kasich’s] plan, the top one percent in Ohio will pay $10,000 less in income tax each year, but Ohio’s working and middle class families will pay more,"" Ramos said Feb. 19 in a written statement.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to audit the representative’s numbers.

Ramos’ office said the assertion draws from a study released by left-leaning think tank Policy Matters Ohio, which cites calculations by the Washington-based Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.

The numbers released in February by ITEP show that the top one percent of Ohio taxpayers, with a mean income above $335,000, would save an average of $10,369 each year. Ohioans earning less than $18,000 would, on average, pay an additional $63 in taxes.

ITEP further asserts that Kasich’s proposed tax reform would typically result in a net loss for Ohioans making up to $51,000 each year.

But how did ITEP get its numbers?

The non-profit said it uses an elaborate microsimulation tax model that calculates the impact of changes to current tax law at the federal and state level.  Among the stratified data used in the model are a large sample of federal tax returns, Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Surveys and Census Bureau American Community Surveys, they said.

The New York Times has lauded the credibility of the model and Bloomberg has used the model’s calculations as reporting tools.

For Ohio, ITEP factored Kasich’s proposed tax revamps – minus his severance tax plan – into its calculations and delivered its findings to Policy Matters Ohio.

That’s where Ramos picked up the figures and used them in his argument that Kasich’s plan would ""shift the burden of taxes from the shoulders of those who have to the shoulders of those who have not."" And Ramos is mostly correct.

The numbers are credible, but Ramos’s statement implies that every working and middle-class family would pay more under the reform.

According to the ITEP numbers, 20 percent of Ohioans earn between $51,000 and $78,000 per year, and would begin to see an average yearly savings of about $75. The line between middle- and upper-class incomes is up for debate – not one to be defined absolutely by PolitiFact Ohio – but it’s safe to say that a yearly income of $51,000 is a far cry from upper-class.    

Ramos was correct in describing the tax benefit to Ohioans with the highest incomes, but he wrongly implied that all working and middle-class families would take a hit under Kasich’s plan.

"['Education', 'Crime', 'Florida', 'Jeff Greene']","
3rd-grade reading stats from Jeff Greene, FL Dem candidate for governor, mostly hold up
","With the Florida governor’s Democratic primary set for Aug. 28, Jeff Greene has made education a vital piece of his platform. In a July 29 interview, Greene said, ""There is a big correlation between third-grade reading level and whether you go to college or whether you go to prison. And in Florida right now, only 56 percent of kids are coming out of third grade at third-grade reading level."" It’s spooky to imagine that the performance of an eight-year-old could predict their destiny more than a decade later. We decided to see if Greene’s statistics held up. A 2010 study by the University of Chicago found that third-grade reading level can be a powerful predictor of future academic success. Researchers tracked thousands of students in the Chicago Public School system from third grade through their high school graduations. The students took a test in the third grade that measured their reading ability and compared their results with national scores. Students who scored lower than 75 percent of third graders nationwide were defined as ""below grade level."" Among students who read below grade level in third grade, only 45 percent graduated high school in five years. Graduation rates were much higher for students who read at grade-level (60 percent) and above grade level (80 percent). The study controlled for demographic factors, so researchers could examine the correlation between test scores and graduation rates without worrying that race or poverty were influencing the results. Though the variables are correlated -- which means a change in one is connected to a change in the other -- the connection is not causal. Low third grade test scores are not causing kids to dropout of high school. Likewise, students who read at or below grade level in third grade were significantly less likely to attend college than their peers. Only about 20 percent of below-grade-level students attended college, whereas roughly a third of at grade-level students did. Nearly 60 percent of above-grade-level readers attended college. There are no studies that directly connect third-grade reading level to incarceration, so the Greene campaign connected it by a two-step process. As noted in the Chicago study, and backed up by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and Georgia governor’s office, students who score below grade level on third grade reading tests are less likely to graduate. Then, there are studies that show high school dropouts are more likely to go to prison. A study from Northeastern University showed that a man with a high school degree had a 1 in 33 chance of incarceration. For a high school dropout, that rate rose to 1 in 10. So, the Greene campaign argues, students who read below grade-level in third grade tend not to graduate high school, and people who don’t graduate high school tend to have higher incarceration rates. Katharine Abraham, director of the University of Maryland Center for Economics and Public Policy, said this conclusion ""seems plausible but doesn’t necessarily follow from the cited facts."" The term ""correlation"" implies that two variables are related, and that one will change alongside the other. One can not assume that because variables A and B are related, and B and C are related, A is also correlated to C. For example, there might be a correlation between higher temperatures and sunny days. There might also be a correlation between sunny days and the number of people who get sunburned. However, this does not mean there is a direct correlation between higher temperatures and sunburns. When asked if it would be accurate to say test scores are correlated to incarceration, Abraham said, ""It might well be true, but you can't logically draw that inference."" Greene also said that only 56 percent of kids in Florida are coming out of third grade at the appropriate reading level. He had more concrete data to back up this claim. He was referring to the results of the most recent administration of the Florida Standards Assessments, which were released in May 2018. The Florida Standards Assessments, or FSA, are a suite of standardized tests that Florida public schools students in grades 3-10 take yearly. They include mathematics exams as well as reading and writing exams. Students’ results on the FSA are classified into five groups, the lowest being Level 1 and highest being Level 5. Level 3 or higher means the student is reading at grade level or above. The spring 2018 results of the English Language Arts (ELA) Grade 3 Reading Exam show that 57 percent of third grade students scored at Level 3 or above. So Greene actually undersold his point. The statistic he was referring to kept track of students reading at or above grade level, not just those reading at grade level. Greene said, ""There is a big correlation between third grade reading level and whether you go to college or whether you go to prison. And in Florida right now only 56 percent of kids are coming out of third grade at third grade reading level."" Studies have shown that there are correlations between elementary school reading proficiency, high school graduation, and college attendance. There are also studies which show a correlation between high school dropout rates and incarceration. However, experts say that you can’t assume a direct correlation between reading scores and prison rates based on this data alone. Greene claimed that ""there is a big correlation between third grade reading level … and whether you go to prison."" This might be true, but we cannot know for sure. In addition, the results from the 2018 administration of the Florida Standards Assessments show that only 57 percent of third graders pass the reading test at or above grade level. So Greene is correct on that point. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/aug/07/jeff-greene/greenes-third-grade-statistics-mostly-hold/

Greg Abbott tweets bogus Winston Churchill quotation about anti-fascists

In his 1:10 a.m. Aug. 7, 2018 tweet, Abbott prefaced his citation of Churchill, who twice served as England’s prime minister: ""Some insights are timeless."" Why Abbott posted the quotation might be explained by the headline on the meme above the purported Churchill quotation; it says: ""Churchill on the left wing."" Later the same morning, multiple others--including Wes Wilson of Austin’s KXAN TV news staff--responded on Twitter by asserting that Churchill didn’t make the statement shared by Abbott. Also, within 10 hours of the Abbott tweet's appearance, it was no longer posted. Abbott then told reporters, Patrick Svitek of the Texas Tribune reported, that it was irrelevant to him ""who may or may not have said that in the past. I didn’t want to be accused of plagiarism for saying it. If no one else said it, attribute the quote to me because it’s what I believe in."" Like other news organizations, meantime, we'd already started to check the accuracy of the quotation. Text down the left side of the Abbott-shared meme mentioned the 9gag.com site, which TechCrunch, a technology news website, described in 2017 as ""a Hong Kong-based site that hosts and distributes funny pictures, videos and memes."" We visited the site and spotted the same Churchill meme under the headline: ""A reference to G20 Thought you might enjoy this quote."" We didn’t spot a posting date on the meme. But reader comments below it start from July 10, 2017. Our phone and email inquiries about Abbott’s claim didn’t draw elaboration from Abbott’s campaign spokesman. Experts spot no evidence Churchill made statement Separately by email, the chief curator of the National Churchill Museum in Fulton, Missouri, Timothy Riley, told us that there’s no evidence to suggest Churchill made the quoted statement in over 15 million words that he wrote encompassing his speeches, articles, books and other writings. ""Whether he uttered the words in conversation is unknowable, but I am not aware of any of Churchill’s contemporaries who record or recall the statement,"" Riley wrote. Separately, the research director of a Hillsdale College project that has been publishing Churchill’s papers responded to us by advising that its internal archive folding in Churchill’s writings, speeches and official biography show no sign of Churchill making the Abbott-quoted statement. Soren Geiger said: ""I feel confident in saying that Churchill never said the statement."" Generally, Geiger said, ""if anything sounds witty or edgy, people can quickly believe that Churchill said it."" We asked Geiger if Churchill made other comments about future fascists. By email, Geiger also provided a copy of Churchill’s July 27, 1943, speech about World War II and Italy to the House of Commons. In it, Churchill said: ""The keystone of the Fascist arch has crumbled, and, without attempting to prophesy, it does not seem unlikely that the entire Fascist edifice will fall to the ground in ruins, if it has not already so fallen. The totalitarian system of a single party, armed with secret police, engrossing to itself practically all the offices, even the humblest, under the Government, with magistrates and courts under the control of the executive, with its whole network of domestic spies and neighbourly informants – that system when applied over a long period of time, leaves the broad masses without any influence upon their country’s destinies and without any independent figures apart from the official classes."" Our ruling Abbott said that Churchill said, ""The fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists.""

Unpaid fine by Betsy DeVos PAC subject of misleading attack by Cordray on DeWine in Ohio
","Democrat Richard Cordray says that his Republican opponent in the Ohio governor’s race, Attorney General Mike DeWine, has been remiss at collecting a fine from a member of President Donald Trump’s administration. ""Education Secretary Betsy DeVos owes Ohio $5.3 million for campaign finance violations and Mike DeWine's office refuses to collect the fine,"" Cordray said in a July Facebook ad. That record breaking fine by the Ohio Elections Commission did happen, but Cordray isn’t telling the full story about the challenges in collecting it. The DeVos-affiliated political action committees were fined by the state of Ohio in 2008, and the fine was upheld in court. But Cordray omits that DeWine has made an effort by filing a lawsuit and winning a judgment. The fines were a subject of litigation for years, including when Cordray was attorney general before DeWine ousted him in the 2010 election. In 2003, DeVos and her husband, billionaire Amway heir Richard DeVos, formed All Children Matter to help candidates who support school vouchers, including in Virginia and Ohio. In 2008, the bipartisan Ohio Elections Commission found that the Virginia PAC sent $870,000 to the Ohio PAC, ignoring a warning in an advisory opinion that such a transfer would be illegal under Ohio’s campaign finance laws. The commission voted unanimously to fine the Virginia and Ohio PACs $2.6 million each. The PACs challenged the commission’s ruling in court, but the court dismissed the case because the PACs failed to sue the proper entity. The litigation continued, though. In February 2010 while Cordray was attorney general, the Ohio Courts of Appeal upheld the lower court ruling, and the Ohio Supreme Court refused to take it up a few months later. We asked Cordray’s campaign spokesman why he didn’t collect the fine when he was attorney general. ""It was being litigated for almost the entirety of his tenure as attorney general,"" Mike Gwin said. In November 2010, DeWine beat Cordray to take over as attorney general. In 2013, DeWine ultimately got a court judgment to enforce the fine. But by then, the PACs had wound down and had minimal assets, leaving nothing to collect.   When Trump nominated DeVos as his education secretary, a group of Democratic senators including Ohio’s Sherrod Brown, said she should pay the fine. In a letter to senators, DeVos disputed that she was personally liable. ""I was an unpaid volunteer director for ACM Inc. and I did not have day-to-day management responsibilities,"" she wrote. ""I was never a party to the legal proceedings."" (She was, however, listed as a director on tax filings.) She also wrote that All Children Matter no longer existed and didn’t have the funds to pay the fines. Greg McNeilly, a political adviser to DeVos, made many of the same arguments to PolitiFact in an email. Cordray said, ""Education Secretary Betsy DeVos owes Ohio $5.3 million for campaign finance violations, and Mike DeWine's office refuses to collect the fine."" The All Children Matter PACs were fined in 2008, and that was upheld by the courts. The PACs ultimately closed, and they never paid the fines. But Cordray makes it sound like DeWine ignored the whole matter, and that’s not the case. He got a court judgment that upheld the fines against the PACs. But by then, there was nothing for DeWine to go after. The fines were ultimately the responsibility of the PACs, not DeVos personally. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Tammy Baldwin ad claiming Kevin Nicholson made $1 million from firms that cut jobs lacks evidence
","U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin used a TV ad to attack both Republicans who are seeking to unseat her, but the Wisconsin Democrat trained her heavier fire on former Marine Kevin Nicholson. Nicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir are vying in the Aug. 14, 2018, Republican primary. The winner will take on Baldwin Nov. 6, 2018. In Baldwin’s ad, released online on July 31, 2018, the narrator asserts: New reports show Kevin Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people. So, Baldwin is portraying Nicholson as being paid big money to play a role in shutting down plants and laying off people. There is a connection. But there is less here than meets the eye. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Associated Press story To back up the narrator’s statement, this headline from an Associated Press news story is shown on the screen: ""Nicholson consulted for companies that shed jobs."" The AP said in the story, posted eight days before the launch of the ad, that the story was based on information provided by the Democratic super PAC American Bridge. American Bridge also produced a video that makes an attack on Nicholson similar to the one in the Baldwin ad. According to the AP article, Nicholson worked as a consultant for companies that laid off nearly 1,900 people since 2015, shutting down plants in Wisconsin and other states as they moved to save money and shift production overseas. Examples included a company that bought Brillion Iron Works near Green Bay through a subsidiary in September 2016 and two weeks later announced it was shutting down the plant, resulting in a loss of 345 jobs. To be clear: The article said Nicholson did consulting for companies that did the layoffs and shutdowns. But it did not say that Nicholson provided any consulting on those decisions. The article also said Nicholson has reported being paid $362,417 in salary and $808,180 in fees (which is a total of more than $1.1 million) from 27 clients between January 2016 and November 2017. But the article did not say how much he was paid for the companies that did the layoffs and shutdowns.
  All of our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race. What we don’t know An executive for ghSMART, the company that employs Nicholson, told us ghSMART helps companies ""interview, evaluate and develop their senior leadership"" and ""has never advised any clients on whether to close a plant or conduct employee layoffs."" And Nicholson’s campaign has reiterated those points, while also going so far in condemning the AP article as to call the reporter a ""liberal hack."" But Nicholson and his company have also described their work as being more broad, involving more than merely advising about executive leadership. The AP pointed out that, according to the ghSMART website, the firm works with companies and investors on ""management assessment and organizational change initiatives."" Nicholson himself, the AP noted, has said his job involves helping companies design strategies for growth, assisting with mergers and acquisitions, and problem solving. And Nicholson’s campaign has described his work as ""helping companies solve their toughest problems."" In short: We simply don’t know what Nicholson may have advised the companies that did layoffs and shutdowns. Our rating Baldwin says: ""New reports show Kevin Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people.""

An Associated Press report said Nicholson worked as a consultant for companies that laid off nearly 1,900 people since 2015, shutting down plants in Wisconsin and other states. And it says Nicholson received more than $1 million for his consulting work between January 2016 and November 2017. But it doesn’t say how much he was paid for consulting for the companies that did layoffs and shutdowns. In short, Baldwin cites no evidence to show how much money Nicholson was paid consulting for those companies.

Leah Vukmir cites old vote in claim against Tammy Baldwin over school safety
","Does Democrat Tammy Baldwin oppose tougher punishments for crimes that happen near schools? That’s what Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Leah Vukmir claimed in a June 1, 2018, news release. In it, Vukmir claimed that Baldwin’s record shows her ""opposing harsher punishments for criminals who commit violent crimes near schools."" The state senator, who is one of the two major Republican candidates hoping to face Baldwin in November, repeated the claim a few days later on The Jay Weber Show on WISN-AM. But is the claim as straightforward as it seems? Here’s the evidence: Baldwin’s 1995 vote The claim is based on Baldwin’s vote against Assembly Bill 159 in 1995. The bill called for increased penalties for those who commit violent crimes inside school zones. Vukmir’s news release, posted on her campaign website, includes a link to records that show Baldwin did vote against the bill, which passed 84-16. (Fifteen of the ""no"" votes were cast by Democrats.) At the time, Baldwin was a member of the Assembly representing Madison. The proposal was advocated by Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson who pushed for it in his budget plan. We could not locate any news articles from the time that included comments on why Baldwin voted against the measure. And campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt refused to comment on why Baldwin voted against the bill. Steve Walters, a longtime Capitol reporter who is now executive producer for WisconsinEye, noted that after the 1994 election the Assembly was under Republican control for the first time in 24 years. The following year, Senate control flipped between the two parties. The measure was passed when the Republicans had Senate control. At the time, Walters said, the Republicans -- including Scott Walker, then an Assembly member -- were passing a number of anti-crime bills. So the bill, and Baldwin’s vote, followed a pattern of Democratic resistance to Republican legislation. What did the bill do? The measure defined school zone as anywhere within 1,000 feet of a school, at bus stops and on school buses. Among the enhanced penalties that became law: -- Allowing judges to add 100 hours of community service to a sentence at their discretion. The community service addition was capped at 40 hours for children convicted of a violent crime who are 12 or 13 years old. -- Increasing the time in prison for felonies by five years and the penalties for misdemeanors by three months in the county jail. So, there is at least one instance where Baldwin voted against a bill that proposed stricter penalties for those who commit crimes in school zones. Other evidence But the same year Baldwin voted against Assembly Bill 159, she supported a bill that prohibited individuals convicted of a serious child sex crime from working or volunteering with children. And a year earlier, in 1994, Baldwin voted for Assembly Bill 194, which increased penalties for illegal drug dealing within 1,000 feet of a facility where youth are present. In recent years, as a member of the U.S. Senate, she voted in favor of two acts aimed at protecting children from sex offenders: the International Megan’s Law in 2015 and the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act in 2016. While these votes do not necessarily concern schools, Neidhardt argued that the single vote in 1995 does not accurately reflect Baldwin’s history of voting to keep children safe. This is not the first time we examined a claim Vukmir made against Baldwin based on a vote from more than 20 years ago. In the same news release, Vukmir claimed Baldwin opposed displaying the American flag, singing the national anthem and saying the Pledge of Allegiance in schools. We rated a tweeted version of the claim, which was built into a broader attack on Baldwin’s patriotism, Mostly False.   That vote related to expanding existing requirements as they related to the flag and anthem, which is slightly different than the claim we are examining here. In this case, the measure created new penalty enhancements in school zones, so a vote against it more clearly represented opposition to the underlying idea from Baldwin. Our rating Vukmir said Baldwin's record includes ""opposing harsher punishments for criminals who commit violent crimes near schools."" That vote on Assembly Bill 159 did happen -- 23 years ago. But in using it as an example of Baldwin being out of step with public sentiment, Vukmir ignores other votes -- including ones from the time that had greater penalties for crimes related to children. That amounts to cherry picking. In our book, that rates Half True.",/factchecks/2018/aug/07/leah-vukmir/leah-vukmir-cites-old-vote-claim-against-tammy-bal/
"['Crime', 'Illinois', 'Rudy Giuliani']","
Giuliani says there were 63 murders in Chicago over the weekend. That’s five times the actual count.
","Following another violent weekend on Chicago’s South and West Sides, President Donald Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani unleashed a series of spelling and fact-challenged tweets aimed at pinning responsibility for unprecedented bloodshed on Mayor Rahm Emanuel. ""63 murders this weekend in Rahm Emmanuel’s Chicago,"" wrote Giuliani, the former New York mayor. ""His legacy [is] more murders in his city than ever before."" 63 murders this weekend in Rahm Emmanuel’s Chicago. His legacy more murders in his city than ever before. It’s only because of Democrat brain washing that he has even a chance of remaining. Support police professional Garry McCarthy. No and no. Giuliani’s attack was framed around an attempt to give a shout-out to one of Emanuel’s expected challengers in next year’s mayoral election, Garry McCarthy, the former Chicago Police superintendent fired by Emanuel in 2015. Except Giuliani misidentified McCarthy as ""Jerry"" instead of Garry. ""Chicago murders are direct result of one party Democratic rule for decades,"" Giuliani wrote, apparently unaware that McCarthy contends he is a Democrat. ""Policing genius Jerry McCarthy can do for Chicago what I did for NYC."" Chicago murders are direct result of one party Democratic rule for decades. Policing genius Jerry McCarthy can do for Chicago what I did for NYC. He was one of the architects of Compstat. Slashed homicides over 70%. Tens of thousands of lives saved. There’s no question that gun violence remains a great challenge for Chicago, but Giuliani’s claims don’t come close to squaring with reality. Preliminary media reports of the weekend carnage referred to 63 shot, not 63 dead. The figure has since been updated. A spokeswoman for the Chicago Police Department said Monday afternoon that a total of 66 people had been shot between 6 p.m. on Friday and midnight Sunday, 12 of them fatally. That is, undoubtedly, 12 too many, though it also important to note the number of homicides this year are down substantially from 2016 when murders spiked to a two-decade high.  To put Giuliani’s claim in perspective, 63 gun-related deaths would be greater than the toll in last October’s mass shooting in Las Vegas where a gunman using high-powered weapons claimed 58 lives. The second beat of Giuliani’s tweet holds up no better. The city suffered 762 murders in 2016, the highest number of Emanuel’s tenure. Still, that is well below the Chicago record of 970 in 1974. Murders also topped well over 900 during several years in the 1990s. The weekend death toll decried by Giuliani was hardly a record, either. On an October weekend in 2016, 17 people were killed in shootings. In 2014, when McCarthy was still running the Chicago police, 13 people were killed and at least 58 wounded during the July 4th weekend despite the deployment of hundreds of extra officers on the streets. Giuliani is hardly the first in Trump’s orbit to to use distorted claims to pick at Chicago’s lamentably persistent rate of gun violence. The president, his spokesperson and his attorney general have all at various times contended that the carnage persists despite the city having the toughest gun laws in the nation. It does not, and we have repeatedly rated such claims as Pants on Fire! The tweet storm from Giuliani fits into that pattern. There were too many shooting deaths in Chicago over the weekend, but nowhere near 63. And murders in Chicago began surging in 2016, but the numbers are still well below the city record of 970 set decades ago. The murder tally, while high under Emanuel, is nowhere near the worst in city history. It is possible Giuliani may have confused shootings with murders. Or, he may have simply been misinformed. Or, he may have made it all up. It’s impossible to tell, though it is worth noting that Giuliani’s numbers were quickly and widely called into question by news reports yet he did not seek to clarify them or delete his tweets. But Giuliani is not only a former New York mayor, he was also once a crime-busting U.S. attorney in that city. If anyone should have a feel for what is real and unreal when it comes to urban violence, it’s Giuliani. Yet he disseminated a wildly exaggerated claim, and that is why we rate it Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2018/aug/07/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-says-there-were-63-murders-chicago-over-w/

Ted Cruz says Beto O'Rourke is 'open to abolishing ICE'
","Republican Ted Cruz, seeking re-election to the U.S. Senate, calls Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke too extreme and reckless for Texas in a video ad including the charge that O’Rourke, the El Paso congressman, is amenable to wiping out the nation’s lead immigration agency. In the ad, brought to light by an Aug. 3, 2018, Texas Tribune news story, Cruz’s narrator says: ""Not even Nancy Pelosi is open to abolishing ICE. But Beto is."" Imagery shows Pelosi and O’Rourke and what looks like a July 2018 Tribune excerpt stating: ""...I’m open to doing that…"" By email, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Emily Miller pointed us to a July 1, 2018, Cruz press release taking note of the Tribune reporting that O’Rourke had said he was open to abolishing Immigration & Customs Enforcement, an idea embraced by some Democrats upset by actions including the separation of children and parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. Miller also pointed out a Cruz release noting that O’Rourke on July 18, 2018 voted against a resolution offering support to ICE officers. O’Rourke was among 34 Democrats to vote against the House-advanced resolution, which was described by The Hill, a Capitol newspaper, as a move by Republicans to divide Democrats by holding a vote on ICE's vitality to public safety. ""Republicans have pounced on those Democrats seeking to abolish ICE,"" the Hill reported, ""accusing them of defending immigrants with no legal status — including violent criminals — instead of protecting the American public."" So, is O’Rourke open to offing ICE? He said as much in July 2018, we confirmed, though he also declared that he wouldn’t support abolition without a plan to shift its responsibilities elsewhere. More recently, O’Rourke has said abolition by itself doesn’t make sense. O’Rourke says he’s open to abolition if duties transfer Our search for relevant news accounts led us to a July 2, 2018, Tribune news story quoting O’Rourke initially saying at a San Antonio stop that he’s open to doing away with ICE or changing how it performs and giving its enforcement duties to another entity--and, in the same appearance, saying he opposes abolishing ICE. From the story: ""Asked about abolishing ICE Friday at a town hall in San Antonio, O'Rourke discussed the need to eliminate fear in immigrant communities under Trump and to find a better way to enforce immigration laws. ‘And if that involves doing away with this agency, giving that responsibility to somebody else, changing how this agency performs, I’m open to doing that,’ O’Rourke said. ""Yet he went on to flatly answer no when directly asked if he would abolish ICE, explaining that he does not currently know enough about how immigration law would be enforced without the agency. ""‘I understand the urgency of this,’ O’Rourke said in conclusion. ‘I just want to make sure that we’re constructive in how we talk about meeting this challenge and that I understand what abolishing ICE would mean in terms of enforcing our laws going forward.’"" The day before, Tribune reporter Patrick Svitek posted a tweet quoting O’Rourke at greater length. According to Svitek, O’Rourke agreed with the individual who asked him about ICE that there’s got ""to be a better way of enforcing our laws, not using those tactics that instill fear, that do not reflect the best of us, not separating children from their parents at the border and keeping them in cages. And so if there’s another, better way to enforce our immigration laws--and I hope we’re all on the same page that we want to make sure that laws are enforced, we want to make sure that our laws reflect who we are and that we change those laws to make sure that we make the most out of all of us--then I’m open to that."" O’Rourke’s reply went on: ""And if that involves doing away with this agency, giving that responsibility to somebody else, changing how this agency performs, I’m open to doing that."" Next, Svitek reported, someone asked: ""So would you abolish ICE?"" O’Rourke replied, per the tweet: ""No. So let me be really clear: I don’t know enough about how we would perform those same enforcement functions, if through another part of the Department of Homeland Security. But if you’re saying abolish the tactics that I just described, yes. I don’t know if you have to abolish the agency to do that…"" He added: ""I just want to make sure that we’re constructive in how we talk about meeting this challenge and that I understand what abolishing ICE would mean in terms of enforcing our laws going forward."" Other news accounts Next we, searched the Nexis news database for instances of O’Rourke speaking about ICE, finding: --A July 5, 2018, Longview News-Journal news story quoting O’Rourke saying in a phone interview that he would join discussions of ICE’s future and how it fulfills its mandate. --A July 6, 2018, Houston Chronicle news story stating O’Rourke had stopped short of calling for ICE’s elimination but was willing to discuss the idea. According to the story, O’Rourke expressed a willingness after a stop in Hillsboro to discuss eliminating ICE, but he said that alone would not solve the problem. O’Rourke said it doesn’t matter if agencies like ICE and Homeland Security are eliminated if such moves don’t address practices including the separation of children from parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. ""I want to make sure we are ending the practices of taking kids from their families,"" O’Rourke said. ""I want to focus on ending the practices."" --Most recently, O’Rourke was asked in an interview posted online July 25, 2018: ""Some of your Democratic colleagues are saying just abolish ICE altogether. A bridge too far for you?"" O’Rourke replied on ABC Radio’s Powerhouse Politics Podcast: ""I just don’t understand it. It’s not clear to me what that would accomplish."" O’Rourke elaborated that abolishing the agency wouldn’t solve the separation of children from parents or the deaths of migrants near the border. ""Abolishing ICE does nothing to solve any of those issues,"" O’Rourke said, in contrast to making changes in federal policy. Ad also touches impeachment, narcotics Cruz’s ad also says O’Rourke supports impeaching President Donald Trump and suggested legalizing all narcotics including heroin--topics we’ve explored. O’Rourke said in an interview for Showtime’s ""The Circus"" in May 2018 that he was willing then to vote to impeach Trump, which constitutionally occurs in the House, though he’s since stressed that he’s not campaigned for impeachment proceedings to commence and he voted against a December 2017 impeachment resolution. This summer, we rated False a Cruz claim that O’Rourke was the nation’s only Senate candidate to call for impeaching Trump. On his campaign website, O’Rourke calls for ending the war on drugs and leaving marijuana regulation to the states. As a member of the El Paso City Council, O’Rourke in 2009 amended a council resolution to include language supporting ""an honest, open national debate on ending the prohibition on narcotics."" At the time, O’Rourke was explicit about not yet personally favoring across-the-board legalization. The council-approved resolution, which didn’t specify any drugs including heroin, was later vetoed. In May 2018, we rated False a claim by Cruz that O’Rourke had a resolution to legalize all narcotics. Our ruling Cruz said in his ad that O’Rourke is ""open to abolishing ICE."" In June 2018, O’Rourke said he’s open to abolishing ICE. However, he also said he wasn’t in favor of eliminating the agency without ensuring its enforcement duties were assigned elsewhere.

California wildfires made worse by hot, dry conditions, not water policy, as Trump tweeted
","In his first tweet about this summer’s California wildfires, President Trump blamed environmental laws for making the blazes worse by preventing firefighters from using a ""massive amount of readily available water."" He said it’s ""being diverted into the Pacific Ocean."" The problem with that claim? The state’s firefighting agency said it’s had no complications accessing water, while fire experts said the state’s hot, dry and windy conditions are to blame for the infernos, not any water policy. Here’s what Trump tweeted on Aug. 5, 2018:  With blazes continuing to ravage the state, we set out on a fact check. We focused on the first portion of the tweet about water policy. Our research Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection told us, it’s the hot and dry conditions taking place earlier in the year that are leading to the extreme fires. ""We have had no issues accessing water to fight the fires,"" McLean wrote in an email. ""This year’s changing weather pattern is leading to more severe and destructive wildfires."" Keith Gilless is a UC Berkeley professor of forest economics and chairman of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection. He said he believes Trump is conflating two very different issues. There’s long been a conflict between farmers and environmental groups over how much water should go to crops versus rivers and lakes. But that fight hasn’t had any effect on firefighting. ""I think there’s some real confusion in the tweet,"" Gilless said. ""The issues over the allocation of water between environmental and agricultural interests have nothing to do with firefighting. And I’m not aware of any situation in which those conflicts have restricted the availability of water for firefighting purposes."" Heat, dry conditions blamed for fires Gilless said the reason California’s wildfires are so destructive this year is the state’s ""high heat, low relative humidity, high wind speeds and high fuel loading."" He said climate change is making these conditions more frequent. ""California is going through a really heartbreaking fire season right now,"" he added. ""Environmental laws about water have nothing to do with it from my perspective."" Gilless said Trump’s language about water ""being diverted into the Pacific Ocean,"" doesn’t make sense, as water naturally flows to the ocean. The argument about how much water should be captured before it gets to the ocean, again, is part of a different, unrelated debate. The second portion of Trump’s tweet, that California ""Must also tree clear to stop fire  spreading!"", is also confusing. Forestry experts say thinning trees is a well-established practice that can reduce the severity of fires. But clearing trees is more commonly associated with commercial logging practices, not fire management. Leroy Westerling, a UC Merced professor and wildfire specialist, told the San Francisco Chronicle that Trump’s tweet, ""On the water side, it boggles the mind."" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for evidence to support Trump’s tweet. A day before the tweet, the Trump administration approved California's request to declare a ""major disaster"" as the state continues to fight wildfires that have claimed at least nine lives. The declaration makes federal funds available to residents of Shasta County, where the Carr Fire outside Redding, California, has destroyed more than 1,000 homes.  Our rating President Trump claimed in a tweet that California’s wildfires are ""made so much worse by the bad environmental laws"" which prevent firefighters from accessing water. He added in the tweet that water ""is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean."" Trump appears to have conflated the state’s real water controversy between farmers and environmentalists with the unrelated issue of firefighting. The state’s fire agency, CalFire, said it has not had problems accessing water. And fire experts said it’s the state’s hot and bone-dry conditions, not environmental laws, that are making blazes more extreme. We rated Trump’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Tony Evers' figures are wrong in attack on Scott Walker over state funding of UW System
","NextGen America is a political group run by California billionaire Tom Steyer, who plans to spend $30 million on the 2018 elections trying to give Democrats control of Congress. On July 22, 2018, the group took a narrower focus, hosting a forum that was attended by four of the eight Democrats running for governor of Wisconsin. NextGen America’s target is younger voters. And at times, its event at the former Pabst brewery site in Milwaukee, brought out the whimsical side of the candidates. Mahlon Mitchell, a firefighter and firefighters union president, used his time for a closing argument to put on firefighter gear in under 60 seconds. And Tony Evers recited the Gettysburg Address and took a selfie with the crowd. But the forum was serious, too, including when the host asked: ""What would you do to make college more affordable?"" Evers answered first. He noted that as part of his role as the state supreintendent of schools, he serves on the state Board of Regents, which governs the University of Wisconsin System. Then he attacked Republican Gov. Scott Walker, saying: ""Since Scott Walker has been our governor, we’ve gone from 50 percent state funding for the (UW) system to 15 percent."" That would be a precipitous drop of 35 percentage points. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. Walker and the GOP-run Legislature did cut $250 million from the UW System in the 2015-’17 state budget. And Democrats have attacked Walker on education funding ahead of the Aug. 14, 2018 primary, as they compete to be the nominee running against the two-term incumbent in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election. But in this case, the attack misses. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. ""Tony misspoke,"" his campaign spokeswoman Maggie Gau told us. ""We acknowledge it's not correct.  As much as we try to prevent them, no one is perfect and mistakes happen on the trail."" UW System’s funding streams The UW System is composed of 13 campuses, including the University of Wisconsin-Madison, that offer four-year and advanced degrees, and 13 campuses that offer two-year degrees. Currently, its operating budget is about $6 billion per year, with about $1 billion — 17 percent — coming from state funding. To see whether that percentage has changed during Walker’s tenure as governor, we turned to a state agency, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. (Federal funding and tuition are the two other largest sources of funding, and there are others, as well.) Here is how much of the UW System operating budgets has come from state funding since the year before Walker took office as governor: Fiscal year Percentage of UW System operating budget from state funding 2010-’11 21.1 percent 2011-’12 (Walker’s first year) 17.9 percent 2012-13 19.2 percent 2013-’14 19.2 percent 2014-’15 19.3 percent 2015-’16 16.6 percent 2016-’17 16.8 percent 2017-’18 17.1 percent So, state funding of the UW System was nowhere near the 50 percent Evers claimed when Walker took office. Rather, it was 21 percent. Since Walker became governor, state funding has been below the 21 percent. Now it’s at about 17 percent, a drop of about 4 percentage points since Walker took office — though above the 15 percent Evers claimed. Our rating Evers said: ""Since Scott Walker has been our governor, we’ve gone from 50 percent state funding for the"" University of Wisconsin System ""to 15 percent."" The gap is much narrower. State funding made up about 21 percent, not 50 percent, of the UW Systems’s operating budget when Walker took office. It’s now at 17 percent, not 15 percent.

Kevin Cramer distorts record on government shutdown
","U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he would oppose a measure to close the government following President Donald Trump’s tweet about a possible government shutdown over immigration. Cramer, running to unseat Democrat Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, touted a clean record without any support for shutdowns. ""I've always voted for keeping the government open,"" Cramer told Robert Port on July 31. ""I’ve never cast a vote to shut down the government."" We took a closer look. Actually, there’s no such thing as a formal ""shutdown vote,"" said Steven Smith, a political science professor at Washington University. Rather, failure to pass appropriations bills by the start of a fiscal year or by the time temporary spending authority expires results in a shutdown. And Cramer has cast votes that indirectly resulted in a shutdown. The votes in question are from 2013, when Republicans in Congress fought the implementation of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act by refusing to fund it. As a minority party, Republicans didn't have the numbers to change the law, and Obama and his fellow Democrats refused to agree to gut it. Following a 16-day shutdown in October 2013, lawmakers voted to fund both the government and the Affordable Care Act. ""He has voted for bills he knew would force a government shutdown because they defunded Obamacare and had absolutely no chance of passing the Senate or being signed by the president,"" said Josh Ryan, a political scientist at Utah State University. Essentially, Republicans would bring a bill to the floor to fund a narrow program or agency, Democrats would offer a motion to change the bill, and Republicans, including Cramer, would reject some of those. Most of these were procedural votes, and Cramer voted along party lines. There’s an element of the blame game here, too. ""Sure, Republicans may have advanced a bill that would fail and shut down the government, but then again, Democrats could vote for the bill and keep the government open,"" said Ian Ostrander, a political science professor at Michigan State University. Cramer’s office presented the same argument. ""The votes you reference were all procedural gambits to try and reopen the government that Democrats attempted to institute because they did not want to vote on the funding bills Republicans were offering, which would have funded vital parts of the government,"" Tim Rasmussen, Cramer’s campaign spokesman. This question is a little easier to answer when it comes to the U.S. Senate, because its rules structure allows for more obvious delaying tactics. We rated Sen. Ted Cruz’s claim he opposed a shutdown Pants on Fire, for example, because he voted against cloture (needed to break a filibuster) on a vote to fund the government. A senator can vote for cloture and still oppose the bill at hand, but by opposing even that, Cruz favored a shutdown over compromise. But with no filibuster in the House, it’s harder to disentangle policy positions from efforts to directly cause a shutdown. Cramer said, ""I've always voted for keeping the government open. I’ve never cast a vote to shut down the government."" We found multiple instances where Cramer indirectly helped to cause a shutdown by voting for bills that defunded Obamacare -- these bills had no chance of survival in the Senate or of being signed by then-President Obama. While Cramer's actions were not direct votes on keeping the government open, they encouraged the 2013 shutdown.

Article wrong that Clapper said Obama is behind Trump Russia collusion investigation
","A website accused James Clapper of throwing President Barack Obama under the bus for ordering the Trump campaign ""witch hunt."" The headline published on AmericanJournalReview.com says, ""James Clapper Flips On Live TV, Admits Obama Behind Entire Russia Witch Hunt! (Video)."" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This story is drawn from an interview on CNN in which Clapper pushed back against President Donald Trump’s claim that Obama failed to address Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The clip shows Clapper, the former director of national intelligence under Obama, telling Anderson Cooper: ""One point I'd like to make, Anderson, that I don't think has come up very much before, and I'm alluding now to the president's criticism of President Obama for all that he did or didn't do before he left office with respect to the Russian meddling. ""If it weren’t for President Obama, we might not have done the intelligence community assessment that we did, that set up a whole sequence of events which are still unfolding today, notably, Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. President Obama is responsible for that. It was he who tasked us to do that intelligence community assessment in the first place."" Clapper is talking about an assessment that Obama asked the intelligence community to carry out beginning in early December 2016, around the time the CIA had concluded Russia meddled in the election to help Trump and hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But Obama’s request for an intelligence deep-dive into Russian meddling doesn't support what the headline claims. The article is referring to a different aspect of the Russia probe, which didn’t emerge until several months after Obama left the White House. The key distinction here is the difference between the intelligence community assessment Obama ordered in December 2016, and the appointment in May 2017 of Robert Mueller as special counsel. Mueller was tasked to investigate both Moscow’s election interference as well as ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. According to Kenneth Gray, a criminal justice professor at the University of New Haven, an intelligence community threat assessment is one method developed in response to Pearl Harbor. Agencies wanted to prevent surprise attacks against the United States and identify potential threats. The article wrongly conflates the Obama-directed intelligence assessment with Mueller’s investigation of possible collusion by members of Trump’s campaign.   It’s also important to note that it was a Trump appointee, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller as special counsel. Obama may have been a distant link in a causal chain, but it was a Trump appointee who is directly responsible for the ongoing special counsel probe. A close reading of Clapper’s interview makes clear he never said Obama was the proximate cause of  the Mueller investigation, as the article alleges. Clapper has also rejected the notion that the investigation is a ""witch hunt."" Part of our reporting process is to reach out to the author of claims we’re checking.

In the video the article references, Clapper said Obama tasked intelligence officials to assess threats after the CIA concluded Russia meddled in the 2016 election. Obama requested the threat assessment in December 2016 and the special counsel wasn’t appointed until May 2017. The article inaccurately conflates these two events.   It’s inaccurate to say Clapper ""flips"" in his statement.

Yes, but: Explaining GOP's attack on governor candidate Tony Evers on not revoking teacher's license
","With the Aug. 14, 2018 primary election closing in, the Wisconsin Republican Party on Aug. 1, 2018 released radio ads attacking four of the eight Democrats who are running for governor. In announcing the ads, the party identified Tony Evers, Matt Flynn, Mahlon Mitchell and Kelda Roys as the leading candidates to win the right to challenge GOP Gov. Scott Walker in the general election on Nov. 6, 2018. The ad attacking Evers, who is the state schools superintendent, claims Evers ""didn't revoke the license of a teacher caught spreading pornography and commenting on the bodies of middle-school girls."" An earlier version of the GOP attack, which we fact checked in 2017, rated Mostly False on the Truth-O-Meter. The revised attack does a little better, but still leaves out important context. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. The teacher The radio ad alludes to the case of Andy Harris, a middle-school science teacher in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison. As we reported in the earlier fact check, Harris was fired in 2010 for viewing images of nudity on his school computer and showing at least one of them to a female co-worker. As the state GOP continued to hammer on the case in 2017, it was later reported that a fellow staff member had told the school district’s investigators Harris also had made crude remarks to staffers about the appearances and chest sizes of female students. However, Evers’ department said neither the department nor the arbitrator could determine whether Harris actually made the sexually crude comments. Harris got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he had been improperly fired. The arbitrator concluded that Harris’ behavior did not endanger any students  — a key finding, based on state law at the time — and the decision to give Harris back his job was upheld by two courts. The real punch in the Republican Party’s attack, though, is aimed at Evers. So, where does he come in? Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Evers’ role Evers did have the discretion on whether to go through license revocation proceedings, which Harris could have challenged. But Evers decided against seeking revocation after concluding, as the arbitrator did, that the teacher’s behavior didn’t endanger kids, as defined by the law at that time. In other words, in the view of Evers’ department, there was no legal basis to take away Harris’ license.

At the time, state law defined immoral conduct in such cases as ""conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil."" After the Harris case, the law was changed so that immoral conduct includes ""the intentional use of an educational agency’s equipment to download, view, solicit, seek, display, or distribute pornographic material."" That is, the part about endangering students was removed, a change that was backed by both Evers and Walker. We’re on the 6 p.m. newscasts on WTMJ-TV on Wednesdays and Fridays. The state Republican Party says Evers ""didn't revoke the license of a teacher caught spreading pornography and commenting on the bodies of middle-school girls."" It’s true that Evers, as the state schools superintendent, opted not to revoke the teacher’s license. But what’s left out is that Evers concluded that state law at the time didn’t allow for a revocation because the teacher’s behavior didn’t endanger children. The same conclusion had been reached by an arbitrator, who ruled the teacher had been fired improperly and gave the teacher back his job. And two courts upheld the arbitrator’s decision. The importance of the endangering standard was underlined by the fact that the Legislature later made sure to take that clause out. The attack on Evers is partially accurate, but leaves out important details  — our definition of Half True.",/factchecks/2018/aug/06/republican-party-wisconsin/yes-explaining-gops-attack-governor-candidate-tony/
"['Education', 'Illinois', 'JB Pritzker']","
Pritzker called Illinois’ workforce the nation’s most educated. He’s wrong.
","In a typical race for governor, the incumbent would be the one talking up his state’s strengths while the challenger might lament shortcomings. But nothing is typical about the battle between incumbent Republican Bruce Rauner and Democratic challenger J.B. Pritzker. Defying convention, Rauner has spent a good portion of his term stressing the negative. He has said Illinois is in a ""death spiral"" and complained that Indiana is ""kicking our tails."" A few weeks ago, Rauner had to do damage control after publicly dissing the workforce in Downstate Champaign-Urbana, home of the main campus of the University of Illinois. With the incumbent routinely calling into question the state’s ability to attract business, Pritzker recently tried the opposite tack in a video tweeted out by his campaign. ""We have the most educated, dedicated workforce in the entire nation and that is why businesses want to come here,"" Pritzker says in the clip, which features footage of the candidate visiting offices, farms and classrooms. Tops in the nation is a high bar to meet when it comes to assessing the educational achievement of Illinois workers. So we thought Pritzker’s claim worth checking out. ""Dedicated"" is an unknowable state of mind, so it’s impossible to assess the second beat of Pritzker’s statement. Educational achievement, however, is a widely measured concept. A report ranking states from most to least educated produced by the financial information site WalletHub, for instance, received considerable coverage this year. And U.S. News & World Report also routinely releases lists of the states with the highest education levels. Neither ranks Illinois as number one among states—or even in the top ten. We asked Pritzker’s campaign to explain Illinois’ absence from the top of those rankings, and spokesman Jason Rubin didn’t attempt to back up his boss with facts. Instead, Rubin reframed Pritzker’s statement as opinion. ""Unlike Bruce Rauner, J.B. Pritzker believes Illinois has the most dedicated, educated workforce in the country,"" Rubin wrote in an email. The gold standard for ranking education achievement among the states is the U.S. Census, which also provides estimates for the share of each state’s workforce that holds degrees. That is a metric more closely in line with Pritzker’s claim. On that count, Illinois fares slightly better than it did in the broader assessments from WalletHub and U.S. News. According to the Census, nearly 40 percent of Illinois’ labor force had attained at least a Bachelor’s degree as of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available. Loading... That puts Illinois’ workforce in 10th place nationally. Tops on the list was Massachusetts. By a slightly different measure, Minnesota leads the states when it comes to the share of the labor force with at least some college credit or a community college Associate’s degree. Illinois was 13th. Illinois does, however, have an edge over its immediate neighboring states when it comes to its share of college-educated workers, census data show. That is a factor that could bear importance for white-collar businesses looking to relocate to the region. Chicago-based demographer Rob Paral said that’s not surprising given that Chicago, which is home to roughly one-fifth of Illinois’ population, boasts the highest percentage of college graduates among the nation’s seven largest cities. Pritzker said Illinois has ""the most educated workforce … in the entire nation."" But census figures show the state ranks tenth for the share of its workforce that holds a Bachelor's degree or higher. When pressed, Pritzker’s campaign made no attempt to back up his claim, restating it as a matter of opinion rather than fact. Pritzker’s praise for the educational prowess of Illinois’ workforce is not entirely out of left field, but it falls well short of the numbers.

"['National', 'History', 'Donald Trump Jr.']","
No, the Nazi platform did not echo the Democratic platform, as Donald Trump Jr. said
","  At the Washington, D.C., premiere of a new movie by conservative filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza, Donald Trump Jr. gave an on-camera interview to One America News Network, a conservative outlet. In it, the younger Trump echoed one of D’Souza’s themes that Democrats are a crypto-Nazi party. ""You see the Nazi platform from the early 1930s ... look at it compared to the DNC (Democratic Party) platform of today, you're saying, 'Man, those things are awfully similar' to a point where it's actually scary. It's the exact opposite of what you’ve been told."" (The Aug. 1 interview can be seen on video here, around the 3:20 mark.) Really? The assertion appears to originate with D’Souza’s 2017 book, The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left. In one passage, he cites a 25-point program that included nationalization of large corporations, government control of banking, the expropriation of land, a broader pension system, and universal free health care and education. If you read the Nazi platform without knowing its source, you could easily be forgiven for thinking you were reading the 2016 platform of the Democratic Party. Or a least a Democratic platform drafted jointly by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Sure, some of the language is out of date. The Democrats don’t talk about ""usury"" these days; they’d have to substitute ""Wall Street Greed."" But otherwise, it’s all there. All you have to do is cross out the word ""Nazi"" and write in the word ""Democrat."" D’Souza did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but Trump Jr. sent a tweet on Aug. 2 that said, ""So the left spends the last 3 years falsely calling my entire family NAZI’s, but the second I point out the similarities between the economic platform of the National Socialists and the Democrat Party, they scream bloody murder. Here’s what I was referring to. #facts."" The tweet linked to a teaser clip from D'Souza's film that covers much the same ground as the excerpt above. We dug out the original Nazi platform from 1920 and consulted with historians of the period. There was wide agreement that D’Souza has made a dubious and overly simplified comparison of the Nazis and the Democrats while also overlooking large portions of the platform that couldn’t be further from present-day Democratic orthodoxy. ""There is not the slightest, tiny sliver in which this could be even somewhat accurate,"" said Jeffrey Herf, a University of Maryland historian and author of The Jewish Enemy: Nazi Propaganda during World War II and the Holocaust. Herf is a self-described critic of President Barack Obama, yet he said he can say confidently ""that the Democrats have nothing in common with the Nazi Party."" In 1919, Adolf Hitler joined what was then the tiny German Workers' Party and began to convert it to his renamed National Socialist German Workers' Party, said Richard Breitman, an American University historian and author of The Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution. Hitler became a co-author of the party’s program of 1920. (At that point, Germany had democratic elections.) The document is important, historians said, but it also requires a caveat. ""It did not reflect all of Hitler’s views — it was a compromise,"" Breitman said. Some items — indeed, many of those that D’Souza says echo contemporary Democratic Party planks — are socialist. But even some of these are overlain with nationalist ideas more in tune with Hitler’s thinking, and overall, a majority of the planks articulate an extreme form of racial nationalism that is absent from modern-day Democratic platforms. The economic elements D'Souza emphasized need important context, said Laurie Marhoefer, a historian at the University of Washington who has studied the period. ""The socialist elements in national socialism are in service to the racism,"" she said. ""That's very different from socialism itself, from social democracy, and from the Democrats in the United States, who aren't even social democrats."" We found only three points in the 1920 Nazi platform that could be described as clearly similar to points made in the 2016 Democratic Party platform. • ""We demand the extensive development of insurance for old age."" • Support for ""the aim of opening up to every able and hard-working German the possibility of higher education and of thus obtaining advancement. ... We demand the education of gifted children of poor parents, whatever their class or occupation, at the expense of the state."" • ""The state must ensure that the nation’s health standards are raised."" However, these goals are so anodyne that not only the Democratic platform but also the Republican platform in 2016 mentioned them. In three other cases, it’s possible to cherry-pick language from the Nazi platform that echoes Democratic Party principles of equality, prosperity and freedom, but a closer look reveals important differences. • ""All citizens shall have equal rights and duties."" This sounds inoffensive, but elsewhere in the Nazi document, it offers an exclusionary definition of ""citizens"" — specifically, that ""only those of German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. Accordingly, no Jew may be a member of the nation."" • ""We demand the creation and maintenance of a healthy middle class."" This may sound like American political boilerplate, but the next clause defines the pathway to this goal as ""the immediate communalizing of big department stores, and their lease at a cheap rate to small traders."" There’s nothing in the Democratic platform about expropriating department stores for the benefit of small-business owners. • ""We demand freedom for all religious denominations in the state."" This sounds fine, but the sentence goes on to clarify, ""provided they do not threaten its existence nor offend the moral feelings of the German race."" The majority of points in the platform address issues that cannot be found in the Democratic Party platform. • Colonization. ""We demand land and territory (colonies) to feed our people and to settle our surplus population,"" the Nazi platform said. • Immigration restrictions and deportations. The document says, ""If it should prove impossible to feed the entire population, foreign nationals (non-citizens) must be deported from the Reich."" In addition, ""all non-German immigration must be prevented."" The 2016 Democratic platform, by contrast, says the party ""supports legal immigration"" and would maintain ‘the United States’ role as a beacon of hope for people seeking safety, freedom, and security."" • The death penalty. The Nazi platform said that ""common criminals, usurers, profiteers, etc., must be punished with death, whatever their creed or race."" But the Democratic platform calls for abolishing the death penalty. • Nationalization of the economy and expropriation of assets. While some may suggest that Democrats’ preference for progressive taxation and regulation of the free market are tantamount to socialism, the elements of the Nazi platform derived from the socialist side of its roots are more far-reaching than elements of the Democratic platform. For instance, the Nazi document advocates ""the abolition of incomes unearned by work,"" ""the ruthless confiscation of all war profits,"" ""the nationalization of all businesses which have been formed into corporations,"" and ""expropriation of land for communal purposes without compensation, the abolition of ground rent, and the prohibition of all speculation in land."" • Restrictions on the press. The Nazi document said that ‘the publishing of papers which are not conducive to the national welfare must be forbidden"" and added that ""non-Germans shall be prohibited by law from participating financially in or influencing German newspapers,"" punishable by ""immediate deportation."" Nothing like this appears in the Democratic platform. • Racial purity. The roots of the Holocaust can be detected in the 1920 Nazi platform. ""Only members of the nation may be citizens of the state. Only those of German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. Accordingly, no Jew may be a member of the nation."" It goes on to say that the party ""combats the Jewish-materialist spirit within and without us."" This element offers the starkest difference, experts said. ""There is nothing in the Democratic Platform that resembles the central point of the Nazi movement — that ‘no Jew may be a member of the nation,’"" said Peter Hayes, a Northwestern University professor of history and German and author of Why?: Explaining the Holocaust. And as harsh as some of its rhetoric is, the 1920 document actually underplays what Nazism eventually became. ""Because Hitler wanted to create the image of consistency and infallibility, he never changed the program after he became Fuehrer of the party,"" Breitman said. ""He just continued to radicalize his views. When he gained power in 1933, he exploited opportunities to seize dictatorial control and then worked to expand party-state control of all aspects of life."" Trump Jr. said, ""You see the Nazi platform from the early 1930s ... look at it compared to the (Democratic Party) platform of today, you're saying, 'Man, those things are awfully similar,' to a point where it's actually scary."" Only a small number of elements of the two platforms are clearly similar, and those are so uncontroversial that they appear in the Republican platform as well. The vast majority of planks in the Nazi platform not only don’t appear in the Democratic platform, but are wholly antithetical to it.

Marco Rubio wrong on states not spending on voting security
","Against the backdrop of Russian election meddling, Senate Democrats came up empty-handed in their effort to pump an additional $250 million into election security money for states. The vote was 50-47 in favor, but they needed 60 to bring the measure to the floor. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., voted against it. When asked why, he emphasized that Washington just sent the states $380 million a few months ago. ""The money we've already appropriated is money that was based on professional assessment of what the needs were from a national level,"" Rubio told CBS News Aug. 2. ""If an additional amount is necessary in the future, we will provide it, but there's no outcry from states saying they need more money. They haven't even begun to spend the money they have now."" There’s debate over whether there’s enough money in the pipeline to replace older voting machines and take other steps to harden state systems, but here, we focus on Rubio’s statement that states haven’t begun to spend the money they have now. Washington has sent states $361 million since May for election security improvements. Every state and territory has submitted plans for how they will use the funds. 24 of those plans clearly show that spending is underway in advance of the 2018 election. (Additional states already might be spending funds, but their plans lacked a clear schedule.) Tucked in the $1.3 trillion spending bill President Donald Trump signed March 23 was $380 million for states to make election security improvements. States could replace electronic-only voting machines, set up a post-election audit system to verify final tallies, upgrade computer systems to prevent hacking, and take other measures along those lines. Washington doled out the money by formula, and by April, the Election Assistance Commission, the agency overseeing the process, had sent states letters telling them how much they would get. As soon as states got those letters, they could start spending, so long as they told the commission and the commission gave the thumbs up. The commission told states, ""By releasing these funds quickly, it is hoped that the grants can have an immediate impact on the 2018 election cycle."" States needed to provide a 5 percent match, but were given two years to do that. They had to submit plans and report how much they spent and on what each year. They had until 2023 to request money, but every state and territory has moved to draw down their allotted funds, with a handful hitting technical snafus in doing that. According to plans sent to the Election Assistance Commission, the spending has begun. ""We know that at least 24 states have definitely been spending money prior to the 2018 election,"" said commission director of grants Mark Abbott. ""That number may be larger, as some states are deploying funds but did not specify in their plan what years the funds will be used."" In Rubio’s home state, Florida’s Secretary of State Ken Detzner approved over $10 million in election security grants to 49 of 67 counties in late July. In June, South Carolina began assessing the vulnerabilities of its voter registration and elections management system. The state has organized a two-day meeting of election officials for August so they can see voting machine options that meet higher security standards. A few days before Rubio spoke, the Illinois State Statewide Terrorism and Intelligence Center interviewed people for a cybersecurity program manager to work with local election officials. The state’s Department of Innovation and Technology is now hiring nine technicians to conduct risk assessments and training with local election authorities. California has started drawing down about $3 million it plans to spend to strengthen the cybersecurity of its statewide system at the county level. ""There’s hiring all over the country to beef up staff,"" Abbott said. ""Other states are buying subscriptions to services to spot malware and filter email. You have to bring people together to make sure everyone at the state and local levels are on the same page, and many states have started doing that."" The number of dollars out the door is a small sliver of what the total spending will be. We found about $45 million earmarked for the first year across just four states — Illinois, New York, California and Florida. (The total planned spending is much higher. We were able to glean this figure from states where we could see both how much they planned to spend and when they planned to spend it.) We contacted Rubio’s office for supporting information and did not hear back. Rubio said states have ""not even begun"" to spend the election security money they have now. That is at best an exaggeration and in terms of state activity, factually incorrect. At least 24 states have started spending the recently released federal dollars and just as important, they are signing contracts and making commitments to spend millions of dollars in the coming months. The only element of truth is that states have just begun to spend this new money, and it is a small portion of what has been approved. This is one possible way to understand Rubio’s statement. But if that was his meaning, he could have said so. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/aug/03/marco-rubio/rubio-wrong-states-beefing-voting-security/
"['Crime', 'Religion', 'Terrorism', 'Texas', 'Omar Rachid']","
Texan says U.S. Muslims lately subject to more attacks, hate crimes than ever
","A Texas member of a Muslim congregation said after a man was convicted of setting its mosque on fire that the United States isn’t what it used to be. Muslims can’t afford to lower their guards, Omar Rachid, a board member at the Victoria Islamic Center, told the San Antonio Express-News for a July 2018 news story stating that Marq Vincent Perez, just convicted of burning the mosque, faces up to 40 years in prison when he is sentenced in October 2018. Rachid then made a claim making us wonder: ""The reality of it is that Muslims in America have been subjected to more insults, attacks and hate crimes in the last two or three years than ever before, specifically more than after 9/11,"" Rachid said, adding: ""Islamophobia is thriving. This is not America. It is not the America I came to 35 years ago."" We didn’t divine how to pin trends in insults. But, we found, the FBI and others tabulate anti-Muslim attacks and hate crimes. Have records recently been set? By phone, Rachid told us he based his declaration on accounts of upticks tied to FBI figures; he emailed us web links to news stories and a commentary published in 2017 and 2018. Included was a November 2017 Pew Research Center blog post citing FBI figures indicating 307 incidents of U.S. anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2016, which marked a 19 percent increase from 2015. Pew’s post specifies that a record was set in 2016 in the subcategory of anti-Muslim assaults, which rose significantly between 2015 and 2016, per the FBI, easily surpassing the previous peak reached in 2001, the year of the 9/11 attacks. For 2016, the FBI reported 127 reported Muslim victims of aggravated or simple assault, compared with 91 the year before and 93 in 2001, Pew's post says.  SOURCE: Blog post, ""Assaults against Muslims in U.S. surpass 2001 level,"" Fact Tank, Pew Research Center, Nov. 15, 2017 (accessed July 31, 2018) ""But assaults are not the only form of hate crime carried out against Muslims and other religious groups,"" Pew’s post says. ""The most common is intimidation, which is defined as reasonable fear of bodily harm. Anti-Muslim intimidation also increased in 2016, with 144 reported victims, compared with 120 the previous year."" Pew cautioned, though, that the 2016 ""intimidation"" count was ""dwarfed by the 296 victims of anti-Muslim intimidation in 2001"" tallied by the FBI. A general caution: Pew and others that explore anti-Muslim activism stress that the FBI collects hate crime data from about 15,000 law enforcement agencies that voluntarily participate, which means the statistics likely undercount hate crimes. FBI reports on anti-Muslim incidents Next, we looked directly at the FBI’s annual reports on hate crimes, which the agency defines as ""criminal offenses motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias against"" a particular group such as a religion, race or sexual orientation. It looked to us like the greatest percentage spike in reported anti-Islamic incidents occurred between 2000 and 2001. For the latter year, the FBI tallied 481 anti-Islamic incidents--a count up more than 1,600 percent from 28 in 2000. According to the FBI, such incidents decreased by 68 percent to 155 the next year and then dipped to 149 in 2003 before escalating to 156 in 2004. We also reviewed the agency’s recent tallies, finding there was not a bigger-than-post-9/11 spike in incidents in recent years -- though the numbers have been on the rise. The 307 incidents noted for 2016 compare to 257 reported incidents in 2015, the FBI says, and that count was up 67 percent from 154 anti-Muslim incidents reported in 2014. Put another way, the 2016 tally reflected a two-year 99 percent increase. But that latest count still fell 36 percent shy of the agency’s 2001 count of 481 anti-Muslim incidents. A California researcher Rachid offered among the stories fueling his claim a July 2017 analysis of hate crimes against U.S. Muslims by Brian Levin, who directs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Levin’s article, covering every year since 9/11, says that from 2002 to 2014, the FBI’s counts of anti-Muslim crimes receded to a range of 105 to 160 though the 257 tally for 2015 was the highest since 2001 and, the article says, the second-highest total of anti-Muslim hate crimes since the agency began eliciting reports of hate crimes from police agencies in 1992. Not only did anti-Muslim crime cases rise numerically, the article says, they grew as a percentage of all hate crimes, accounting in 2015 for 4.4 percent of all reported hate crimes even though Muslims are estimated to be only 1 percent of the population, the article says. By phone, Levin told us that in 2016, per FBI figures, anti-Muslim hate crimes accounted for 5 percent of all hate crimes. After 9/11, Levin told us, anti-Muslim hate crimes represented 4.5 percent of hate crimes reported by the agency. In 2016, Levin’s published calculations of hate crimes against Muslims were cited by Hillary Clinton to justify her claim that hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques had tripled after attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. Levin said in a 2016 interview that since 9/11, anti-Muslim incidents ranked second to anti-Jewish incidents among all anti-religious hate crimes. PolitiFact rated Clinton’s claim Mostly True. Civil rights reports by CAIR Hoping for more up-to-date information, we approached several non-government groups about research into anti-Muslim incidents. This tack drew data only from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which says it challenges stereotypes of Islam and Muslims. Zainab Arain of CAIR pointed by email to the council’s latest annual civil rights report. The April 2018 report, based on investigations by council staff, says that in 2017, there were 2,599 U.S. anti-Muslim ""bias incidents,"" including 300 hate crimes--a count exceeding the council’s confirmation of 2,213 incidents in 2016 by 17 percent. The report classifies incidents by type. Harassment, it says, accounted for 14 percent of the confirmed incidents in 2017 with incidents in which an individual was ""inappropriately targeted and harassed by Customs and Border Protection"" proving second-most prevalent. Anti-Muslim hate crimes, including crimes targeting children and families, made up 12 percent of the 2017 cases, the report says, with incidents involving FBI harassment or other targeting of individuals constituting 10 percent of incidents.    SOURCE: Web page, ""2018 Civil Rights Report: Bias Incident Data,"" Council on American-Islamic Relations, April 30, 2018 (fetched Aug. 1, 2018) Its counts, the report says, should be considered only a ""snapshot of the experiences of American Muslims, including children, youth, and families. From experience, CAIR knows that bias incidents targeting the community are vastly underreported to both law enforcement and community institutions. Community members will often not report incidents, such as harassment and bullying, because of a certain level of desensitization,"" the report says. Arain told us: ""Based on the numbers we report, we have documented more anti-Muslim bias incidents and anti-Muslim hate crimes from 2015 to present than were documented in the year immediately following September 11, 2001."" We followed up by checking the council’s 2002 civil rights report. It says the group received 1,516 complaints from community members over the year involving the lives of more than 2,250 people, most of whom ""were subjected to incidents of bias-motivated harassment and violence"" including several murders, the report says. The report says its complaint count was up 300 percent from the year before. ""Excluding the September 11 backlash incidents,"" the report says, ""this year's normal reporting period contains 525 valid complaints, up from 366 in 2000/2001--a 43 percent increase."" Our ruling Rachid said: ""Muslims in America have been subjected to more insults, attacks and hate crimes in the last two or three years than ever before, specifically more than after 9-11."" Incidents confirmed by the pro-Muslim CAIR support this statement. Also, FBI hate-crime statistics drawn from police departments indicate there were more anti-Muslim assaults in 2016 than after 9/11 though its counts generally indicate there were more anti-Muslim incidents after 9/11.

Was a Massachusetts man targeted in a hit-and-run because of a Trump bumper sticker?
","A headline attracting clicks on social media said a Massachusetts hit-and-run victim was targeted by a ""left wing extremist"" because of a campaign bumper sticker for President Donald Trump on his car. ""Chloe Wright — left wing extremist, chases down, rams car over Trump bumper sticker,"" said an Aug. 1 headline from the Pacific Pundit, a conservative blog. This headline was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ""Another left wing extremist loses their s--- over a Trump bumper sticker,"" the story said. ""Chloe Wright a left wing extremist in Massachusetts got triggered over an SUV with a Trump bumper sticker."" ""The liberal loon Chloe Wright was so triggered, she chased down and rammed the car with the bumper sticker,"" the story continued, before quoting directly from a CBS Boston article. But CBS Boston, the Cape Cod Times and other credible local reports wrote their stories without the same type of loaded language. On June 30, a man contacted police in Barnstable, Mass., to report a hit-and-run. According to a police report cited by the Cape Cod Times, the man told responding officers he was stopped for a red light when Wright, the driver of the car behind him, started honking. The man told police that Wright trailed his car as he drove off and continued honking. At the next red light, he said she also started yelling. The man said he stepped into the road to inspect the back of his own vehicle for any problems, at which point Wright began yelling specifically about a campaign bumper sticker for Trump that he had positioned above a spare tire on his car’s rear window. ""She said, ‘You voted for Trump?’"" the man reportedly wrote in a statement. ""I said yes. She called me a racist and several other names."" The man began recording the incident, and Wright rolled her car in his direction. He said he retreated toward the opening of his driver’s side door just as Wright drove at him and struck the door with her car. CBS Boston reported that she came inches from hitting the man. Wright then sped off down the street, according to the man’s statement to police as cited in the police report. The man’s girlfriend, seated in the passenger seat throughout the incident, reportedly confirmed the man’s account of events. The man’s recording of the altercation shows Wright's gray Honda Civic collide with the open driver’s-side door. Wright pleaded not guilty July 30 to a charge of assault with a dangerous weapon and will return to court on Aug. 28 for a pretrial hearing. She also faces charges of vandalizing property and leaving the scene of property damage. By the victim’s account, Wright intentionally rammed her car into his at least in part because she was outraged over his bumper sticker. On the other hand, Wright's version of events has not yet been reported or vetted in court. Judging from what has already been reported, we cannot conclude with certainty that Wright is a ""left wing extremist"" or that she acted out solely because of the victim’s Trump bumper sticker. Until further details emerge in court, a more precise headline is needed to reflect what allegedly occurred. For example, the Cape Cod Times headline read, ""Woman accused of hitting car in Hyannis after confrontation over Trump bumper sticker."" A headline from Pacific Pundit said a ""left wing extremist, chases down, rams car over Trump bumper sticker."" The details laid out in the story were mostly in line with what has been reported in other credible outlets. Until we hear more from the case, the story and headline should be more precise.
