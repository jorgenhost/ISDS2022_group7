Schumer: 244 people on terror watch list tried to buy guns in 2015, 91% got them
","The mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., June 12 reopened the debate over who should access to guns, with Democrats calling for stricter controls. During a June 14 news conference in Washington, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said most people suspected of terrorism in the United States haven't haven't found it difficult to purchase a weapon. ""Last year, 244 people on the terror watch list tried to purchase guns; 244 suspected terrorists walked into gun shops and attempted to purchase a firearm; 223 were able to get the firearm. Only 21 went empty-handed,"" Schumer said. ""Ninety-one percent of suspected terrorists, when they sought to purchase a gun, last year were successful, according to GAO."" The GAO is the U.S. Government Accountability Office. First, some background on these ""suspected terrorists."" The FBI's Terrorist Screening Center maintains a list of people ""known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity."" This list is secret but it's believed to have around 700,000 names collected by U.S. and global agencies. It's estimated that 10,000 of those names are Americans and the rest are foreigners. We looked at this issue in December when we examined U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy's tweet that ""91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted."" We rated Murphy's statement Mostly True. (Murphy, who is running in Florida's Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in 2016, issued the tweet after Republicans repeatedly blocked a bill that would keep people on the FBI list from buying guns.) Murphy was referencing a GAO report from March 2015. But Schumer's statement focused on the entire year of 2015. So we found the updated report. Issued March 7, 2016, it found — as Schumer reported — that only 21 of the 244 transactions attempted by people on the terrorist watch list at a licensed firearms shop were blocked. In 223 cases, the customers got their weapons. But there are important omissions in these numbers. So we don't know that 244 people on the list attempted to buy guns. We know that people on the list attempted to buy guns 244 times.  On the flip side, the number of people on the watch list who legally purchased weapons may be far higher because the tally doesn't include transactions made at gun shows, where federal background checks aren’t conducted. Finally, there have been questions about the accuracy of the watchlist itself. A 2009 U.S. Justice Department audit showed that 35 percent of the people on the list were ""associated with FBI cases that did not contain current international terrorist or domestic terrorism designations"" and should have been removed from the list. There also are multiple entries for slight variations of the same name, which means people with the same name as a person on the watch list were stopped at airports, a problem that experts say has largely been resolved. Our ruling Schumer said that in 2015, ""244 suspected terrorists walked into gun shops and attempted to purchase a firearm; 223 were able to get the firearm"" according to the GAO report. He correctly notes that this is gun shop data from the GAO, but he is wrong to suggest that the report is a tally of the number of suspected terrorists trying to make a firearm purchase. As the report makes clear, it's the number of attempted transactions, some of which might have been done by the same individual. The statement is accurate but it needs clarification and additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/47d79ce0-3137-4146-834d-1d858403e397",/factchecks/2016/jun/15/charles-schumer/charles-schumer-terror-watch-list-buy-guns-got-the/

Did your phone, computer contribute to suffering in the Congo?
","As you’re texting away on that snazzy smartphone, you may be ""holding war"" in your hands, says actress and activist Robin Wright. Wright, known for her roles in House of Cards, Forrest Gump, and The Princess Bride, compared minerals extracted in the Democratic Republic of Congo for electronics to blood diamonds in a recent speech and urged consumers to learn more about their electronics. ""I do have an Apple iPhone. And Apple is 90 percent conflict-free currently,"" Wright said May 25. ""Intel is 100 percent conflict-free. They are the biggest distributor of the chip. That’s huge."" Are the vast majority of Apple and Intel products made without financing war in the Democratic Republic of Congo? The answer is complicated. While both Apple and Intel are commended by human rights groups for their leadership in transparency, Wright’s numbers are off. More importantly, experts told us it’s impossible to ensure that anything is completely conflict-free. Conflict minerals, a primer The Democratic Republic of Congo’s rich mineral deposits, worth about $24 trillion, supply the world’s demand for electronics and fund militias that have been warring with each other and the government for decades. Rebel groups like the Lord’s Resistance Army (remember Kony?) and the Congolese military itself loot or seize control of mines in the Kivu region. These mines are notorious for their rampant human rights abuses. The minerals eventually find their way into cell phones, computers, and other products. Armed groups earned an estimated $184 million from just four minerals in 2008 alone. Here’s a video from Enough Project, a human rights group, on how it all works:  Corporate reporting Wright may have been thinking of figures in Apple’s and Intel’s filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but she misstated a few things. As part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, publically traded companies are required disclose use of conflict minerals — specifically tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold — annually to the SEC. In 2014, Apple reported 88 percent of its smelters and refineries were verified as conflict-free or participating in third-party auditing programs. That same year, Intel said 100 percent of microprocessors and chipsets were conflict-free, but it couldn’t determine if the label applied to other products. Both companies improved their numbers in 2015, according to their latest SEC filings. About 78 percent of Intel’s smelters and refineries were deemed conflict-free. Apple stated 100 percent of its smelters and refiners are in audits but said it does not believe verification was sufficient to label its products ""conflict-free."" Here’s a chart showing how the two stack up next to other companies:   Aspirations vs. reality   But experts told us participating in audits or even being deemed in compliance doesn’t guarantee that the minerals are actually conflict-free for several reasons. ""Our position is companies should not be allowed to make those types of statements,"" said Seema Joshi, Amnesty International's Head of Business and Human Rights. Laura Seay, a Colby College professor who studies the African Great Lakes, said ensuring a 100 percent conflict-free global supply chain is near impossible. Carly Oboth, a policy adviser for the watchdog NGO, Global Witness, called the designation ""hypothetical and aspirational."" According to Oboth, smelters and refineries receive verification based on their capacity to do due diligence (i.e. chain of custody documentation and proof of insurance), not whether they’ve taken the steps to ensure their supplies were actually mined humanely. The auditing regiment is currenting being revised, Oboth said, ""but for the time being, there’s no oversight on whether they’re negating risks."" And while Global Witness commended Apple for its decision to reject the ""conflict-free,"" Oboth said it and Intel could be doing more.    There are few means to verify in the conflict-ridden eastern part of the country where many mines are located. Beyond issues of accessibility, miners and the armed groups have found ways of circumventing the system. The majority of minerals are being smuggled into neighboring countries with higher profit margins and much less rigorous certification methods, if they exist at all, Seay told us. ITR, a tin auditing firm, prices a kilo of tin at $2 while the same amount would fetch $4 or $5 in Rwanda. ""If you can get your minerals, which may or may not be conflict-free, into Rwanda, you can get it labeled conflict-free,"" she said. ""Do you take the $2 or do you hire a boat and go to Rwanda? It’s a no brainer."" And even if the minerals stay in the country, Seay pointed out, the audit system has spurred a cottage industry for conflict-free labels: ""You can also buy the tag in the markets in Kigali. All the incentives are set up for people to lie."" Labels as lip service Then there’s the question of whether conflict-free labeling actually curbs violence and protects human rights. The evidence is mixed. Dodd-Frank didn’t work out as planned initially. The Congolese government enacted a temporary ban on mining and companies avoided sourcing from the region altogether. For one of the poorest countries in the world where mining employs one sixth of its population, Dodd-Frank ""set off a chain of events that has has propelled millions of miners and their families deeper into poverty."" Meanwhile, there were few signs that it had tempered violence or weakened the militias. But now that the ban has ended and companies are once again buying from the Democratic Republic of Congo, experts view Dodd-Frank a bit more positively. Seay, an initial critic, says it’s draw attention to the issue. ""It got the attention of the Congolese government in a way that nothing else could have,"" she said, adding, ""A lot of is lip service and a lot of is how much facade we should put up.""  A 2015 report by the International Peace Information Search, a development research institute, found that armed groups have been cut off from many tin, tantalum, tungsten mines, but still profit from gold. Seay said they’ve savvied up (i.e. by removing guards with machine guns from the mines) while finding funding sources in border crossings, charcoal, ""conflict weed"", wildlife smuggling, etc. The narrow focus of Dodd-Frank also means that ""conflict-free"" isn’t the same thing as abuse-free. Amnesty has documented child labor in the DRC’s production of cobalt, which is not designated as a ""conflict mineral."" Global Witness found lapis lazuli funds the Taliban, but Dodd-Frank doesn’t apply because the mines are in Afghanistan. ""You can have a completely clean mine, as designated by Dodd-Frank, with child laborers and where woman are trading sex with the pit bosses in order to sell lunch around the periphery,"" Seay said. ""There’s no such thing as 100 percent conflict-free anything."" Our ruling Wright said Apple products are currently ""90 percent conflict-free,"" and ""Intel is 100 percent conflict-free."" The numbers are off. Intel says 100 percent of is processors are conflict-free, but couldn’t vouch for its other products. Apple reported that 100 percent of its supply chain was participating in audits, but rejected the label. While experts commend both companies for leading the sector in moving away from conflict minerals, they cautioned against labeling anything 100 percent ""conflict-free.""

Pat Toomey’s gun control bill and Katie McGinty’s post-Orlando slam
","Republican Sen. Pat Toomey won praise from Democrats (yes, you read that right) in 2013 when he put his name on a bill that would have expanded background checks after 26 people, including 20 children, were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The bill would have required a background check on all gun sales, including at gun shows and on the Internet with an exemption for sales between family and friends. But despite support from Toomey, the conservative from Pennsylvania, the bill narrowly failed the Senate in April 2013 as families from Newtown, Conn. looked on. Now, Toomey’s up for re-election and his Democratic opponent is hammering him on gun safety legislation after the weekend massacre in Orlando, the largest mass shooting in American history. Katie McGinty has slammed Toomey on his record and implied over the last two days that his support of expanding background checks in 2013 was hollow. ""He leant his name to a bill, did little or nothing three years ago to try to get it passed, (and) since then has done absolutely nothing other than disavow any attempt to move on the legislation,"" she told The Inquirer in a story published Monday. Toomey’s name was on the bill that was pushed three years ago to expand background checks -- it was literally known as the Toomey-Manchin amendment -- yet he hasn’t committed to re-introducing since it failed. But ""disavow"" is a pretty strong word. And it didn’t appear he had out-right denied support for it. So we decided to check the claim. Toomey signs on Following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook, Sen. Joe Manchin, D- W. Va., began drafting legislation that would strengthen background checks and began searching for a Republican to co-sponsor his amendment to the larger Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Manchin began working with Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Wy., but his involvement fizzled out by March 2013. Manchin’s next partner for the legislation? Pat Toomey, who was also getting pressure from a political ad circulating in Pennsylvania that was run by Mayors Against Illegal Guns urging him to support gun control legislation. By the end of March, Toomey was on board and an official announcement was made shortly later. He and Manchin made media appearances and held meetings with senators on both sides of the aisle. A spokeswoman from Everytown, a national gun violence prevention group, said her organization at the time worked directly with Toomey on the legislation. He also appeared with Manchin on the Senate floor to push for its passage and, after his approval, enough Republicans voted to make it essentially filibuster-proof, a move Democrats rallied around. Other Republicans, not so much. ""While all of us like and respect Sen. Toomey,"" Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told The Hill at the time, ""there wasn’t an outpouring of support for his amendment."" Toomey’s name was on the bill for about two weeks before it was brought up for a vote, when it was ultimately defeated 54-46. Five Democrats opposed the bill, but the following four Republicans voted in favor: Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, John McCain of Arizona and Toomey. The three Republicans besides Toomey who voted in favor of the amendment? They all had previously expressed support for expanding background checks on gun sales before Toomey’s involvement. What did he accomplish? McGinty’s campaign argues Toomey accomplished little with regard to moving the background checks legislation forward and, since it failed in 2013, hasn’t re-introduced it. After it was struck down in the Senate, he told Politico ""it’s time to move on."" The amendment was brought up again by Manchin in 2015, and Toomey didn’t speak out in favor of passing it, though he did vote for it. It was again defeated. ""Since the bill expired at the end of 2013, Senator Toomey has had a full year and a half to copy and paste the language from his 2013 bill and simply re-introduce it. He just hasn't done it,"" McGinty’s spokesman Sean Coit said. ""On top of that, he's made it very clear... that he's not interested in the bill anymore and is done working to address gun violence."" So does Toomey still support legislation that would expand background checks though he hasn’t reintroduced his own amendment? Or, as McGinty says, has he ""disavow[ed] any attempt to move on the legislation?"" His Senate office wouldn’t commit to re-introducing the bill -- and The (Allentown) Morning Call reported a gun rights group said Toomey’s office told them last year that it wouldn’t be brought up again. His office disputed that account and spokeswoman E.R. Anderson said this week that Toomey ""continues to strongly support this measure, as well as others, to make it harder for terrorists, criminals, and mentally ill people to obtain guns."" Toomey’s campaign for re-election says the senator was heavily praised following his support of the amendment, including being formally honored by Sandy Hook families at a ceremony last year. ""There are few senators who have done more than Pat Toomey to reach across the aisle and attempt to forge a real bipartisan consensus on critical gun safety legislation,"" spokesman Ted Kwong said in a statement. Democrats take issue with that statement, pointing out that Toomey has rarely brought up the legislation on the Senate floor since it was defeated in 2013 and that he was critical this year of President Obama using executive orders to tighten gun regulations. McGinty again hit Toomey during a press conference Tuesday on gun safety, calling on him to pass legislation that would make it harder for suspected terrorists to buy guns. Last year, Toomey voted against a measure that would have made it illegal for those on the no-fly list to buy guns and instead favored a GOP bill that would have allowed the attorney general to stop a suspected terrorist from buying a gun, but the attorney general would have to do so within 72 hours unless the courts stepped in. Toomey’s contended the Republican bill that was voted on and defeated was a viable option; McGinty this week called it ""toothless."" Our ruling This claim was two-fold, with McGinty claiming 1. That Toomey ""did little or nothing"" to attempt to get the Toomey-Manchin amendment passed and 2. That he has ""done absolutely nothing other than disavow any attempt to move on the legislation"" after it was shot down by the Senate. Toomey signed onto the amendment very late in the game and a vote took place just weeks after his name was added to it. It’s also true that no additional Republicans signed on to vote in favor of the legislation after Toomey added in his support. If McGinty would have said Toomey accomplished little, she would have been right. But to say he ""did little or nothing"" to advance the bill isn’t supported by the facts. The senator also hasn’t re-introduced the legislation since it was shot down and hasn’t indicated that he plans to. But the definition of ""disavow"" is to deny complete responsibility for, and Toomey isn’t against the legislation itself, saying he still supports the measure -- and indeed, he voted for it again. For now, he just won’t be the one to re-introduce it. We rate the claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/755b59a0-1918-454c-bfd7-b7f52d1be31c",/factchecks/2016/jun/15/katie-mcginty/pat-toomeys-gun-control-bill-and-katie-mcgintys-po/

Marco Rubio says after Orlando shooting that 'radical speech is not a crime'
","Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio said in the wake of the Orlando shooting massacre that supporters of terrorism can freely say what they want. ""In America, radical speech is not a crime,"" Rubio told radio show host Hugh Hewitt. ""And that’s one of the challenges we face. You can stand all day long and call for all kinds of jihad. It’s only when you actually moved toward plotting and acting on it that you become actionable and arrestable. These guys know that, and they use it against us."" The FBI had investigated the shooter Omar Mateen in recent years after he claimed to co-workers that his family had connections to the al-Qaida terror network. But probes led to nothing. Is Rubio correct that radical speech in itself is not a crime? We contacted Rubio’s spokespersons and did not get a reply. We were curious what the laws said about radical speech and if he was speaking accurately. Radical speech Multiple legal experts told us that Rubio’s point is generally correct because speech is protected by the First Amendment, which states: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."" Courts have decided that certain speech is not protected by the First Amendment such as ""fighting words"" (speech that would likely draw someone into a fight.) But radical speech is not included in that list. ""The First Amendment protects radical speech,"" said University of Chicago Law professor Geoffrey Stone who has written about the dangers of compromising First Amendment freedoms. Experts said that Rubio omitted one key exception which stems from the 1969 U.S. Supreme Court case Brandenburg vs. Ohio involving a member of the Ku Klux Klan, The  U.S. Supreme Court found that all speech is protected ""except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action."" So that means Americans have a right to advocate lawlessness -- such as overthrowing the federal government -- as long as they avoid inciting imminent illegal action as narrowly defined by Brandenburg. ""For example, if a mob has seized a person they think murdered a child and X starts shouting ‘hang him, hang him,’ that would satisfy Brandenburg,"" Stone said. ""Radical speech doesn't come close."" So verbally supporting ISIS alone isn’t a crime. ""The Supreme Court’s thinking is that people have a First Amendment right to associate with even the worst and most degraded organizations,"" said Loyola law professor Alexander Tsesis. ""The government is prohibited from simply assuming ideological affinity will ‘lead to imminent violence,’ or that it is truly threatening for that matter. Those assumptions must be backed by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt."" However, there is a separate statute that says it is illegal to provide material support to a terrorist organization. That could include ""instructing the foreign terror organization about how to gain standing in a community or religious center. That’s an expressive act, but one the government has a compelling interest to prevent from achieving its supportive purpose,"" Tsesis said. While many people may conclude certain radical speech is offensive, it is generally protected. And there are good reasons for that, said Lee Rowland, a senior attorney at the ACLU. Whether something is ""radical speech"" or ""hate speech"" is in the ears of the listener. For example, some politicians and members of law enforcement have suggested that the Black Lives Matter movement engages in hate speech against police officers. Martin O’Malley, a former Democratic presidential candidate, said that Donald Trump is promoting hate speech with his comments about immigrants. ""The fact that our Constitution robustly protects speech, including speech we find abhorrent, is a feature, not a bug,"" Rowland said. However, in the age of terrorism and the internet, some have raised the question about whether Brandenburg can survive or whether we should find ways to limit free speech. Our ruling Rubio said, ""In America, radical speech is not a crime."" Radical speech is protected by the First Amendment and is not a crime. However, there are limited exceptions for when speech incites imminent crime or when communications specifically aid acts of terror.

Clinton: Clinton Foundation helped 9 million with lower-cost AIDS drugs
","The Clinton Foundation might be committed to doing good around the world, but Hillary Clinton’s critics see it as a ripe target to bring down the presumptive Democratic nominee. Republican Donald Trump recently charged that some countries who gave money to the foundation received favorable treatment in return. For anyone who hasn’t heard about the Clinton Foundation, it’s the signature project to reduce poverty and improve global health created by former President Bill Clinton. It is part matchmaker, helping wealthy donors connect with doers, and part active participant, directly running programs, especially in health care. In an interview with Hillary Clinton, CNN’s Anderson Cooper quoted Trump and asked if her husband would break all ties with the foundation, should she become president. Clinton said she would cross that bridge ""if we come to it,"" and proceeded to give a full-throated defense of the foundation. ""I'm proud of the work that it has done,"" Clinton said in the June 8, 2016, interview. ""Nine million people have lower-cost HIV/AIDS medicine because of the work of the Clinton Foundation and my husband. We have women across the country, from Latin America and Africa -- across the world, I mean -- getting good jobs, and being able to support themselves for the first time."" We’ll focus on the first part of that statement and explore if the Clinton Foundation actually had a hand in making HIV/AIDS drugs more affordable for 9 million people? The foundation’s work on HIV/AIDS treatment dates back to 2002 with the creation of the Clinton Health Access Initiative. That was a time when some countries were paying $1,000 or more to treat each AIDS patient. The basic goal was to bring in bulk-buying to lower costs. The program consolidated both the supply of raw materials to make the drugs and the bidding to supply the finished product. The result was lower production costs and lower drug prices. Today, the initiative tracks the going price for a menu of treatments and posts them to help health departments around the world as they negotiate with drug companies. In 2014, the World Health Organization reported that by the end of 2013, more than 11.7 million people were on antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries. While the kinds of drugs have changed, the WHO said ""in the past decade the price of individual antiretroviral formulations has decreased considerably."" The treatments used in the early days have fallen from a median cost of about $600 in 2003 to about $100 a decade later. A more advanced drug combination introduced in 2005 saw a similar decline. Importantly, the WHO listed the Clinton Health Access Initiative as one of a handful of organizations collaborating on ensuring a steady supply of drugs. The partners in that effort include the biggest players, including several United Nations agencies, PEPFAR (the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) and UNITAID, a project created by  Brazil, Chile, France, Norway and the United Kingdom. UNAIDS announced at the end of May that the number of people under treatment is now closer to 17 million. Technically, the Clinton Health Access Initiative has been a separate nonprofit since 2010, but it is still integrated within the Clinton Foundation and the foundation press office still offers comments on its behalf. Clinton Health Access Initiative spokeswoman Maura Daley told us that Clinton used an old figure for the people being served by the initiative. ""The total number of patients benefitting is 11.8 million,"" she told us. Not everyone getting treatment is counted as benefiting from the initiative’s efforts. Beyond working to reduce drug costs, it also coordinates with nongovernmental organizations inside countries to distribute the drugs once they arrive. Clearly, the Clinton Health Access Initiative did not accomplish all of this on its own, but Clinton didn’t say that. Two experts in HIV/AIDS treatment, Jennifer Kates at the Kaiser Family Foundation, and Ellen ‘t Hoen call the initiative an important player. ‘t Hoen was the first executive director of the Medicines Patent Pool, a group that streamlines the production of generic antiretroviral drugs. ""Without the work of the MPP it would have been much harder for organizations like CHAI to access generic antiretrovirals,"" she said. The initiative has been faulted for failing to fully report donations from foreign governments and has filed amended returns for 2012 and 2013. Our ruling Clinton said 9 million people have lower-cost HIV/AIDS medicine thanks to the efforts of the Clinton Foundation and her husband. Bill Clinton started the foundation and its first big project was the Clinton Health Access Initiative. The program focused on using market mechanisms to reduce treatment costs. Costs have fallen dramatically and the initiative remains a key global player in maintaining a steady supply of affordable drugs. If anything, Clinton understated the number of people who have benefited from the program.

NC Rep says concerns over links between hemp, marijuana aren't based in science
","It may look like marijuana, but hemp cannot get you high. They’re forms of the same species, although hemp has a negligible amount of THC, the high-inducing chemical found in marijuana. Due to the plant's industrial and and agricultural uses, the General Assembly legalized hemp farming last year. Yet many lawmakers fear the hemp industry will provide cover for marijuana growing operations, since the two plants look similar. That argument came up again before the N.C. House overwhelmingly passed further regulations on the hemp industry on June 13. Rep. Larry Yarborough, a Republican from Roxboro, voted for those regulations. But he had previously said the using-hemp-to-hide-marijuana argument is flawed. If a marijuana plant ""gets the pollen (from hemp) and goes to seed, it becomes worthless,"" Yarborough said in a House Agriculture Committee Meeting a few days before the vote. ""The THC goes away."" That’s a pretty sweeping claim that would seem to debunk many concerns. We contacted Yarborough, a chemical engineer and business owner, to ask where he heard that. He backed off the quote a little bit. ""The plant with seed would be worthless in the market,"" he said. ""I don’t know for sure that all the THC would be gone but there would be very little, according to what I have read."" Unlike his original statement, that aligns with mainstream research. We spoke with two professors who have studied hemp in other states, and we read a 2015 report on hemp and marijuana compiled by the federal government. All came to the same conclusion: Anyone who tries to hide marijuana inside a hemp field isn’t a very smart criminal. Regulating hemp The new regulations passed the N.C. House by a vote of 108-3. Next up is a vote in the Senate. If they become law, they will limit the amount of land hemp can be grown on, require the location of all hemp fields to be disclosed to state and local law enforcement agencies, allow officials to inspect hemp fields at any time and make it a felony to use hemp to hide marijuana. Yarborough, who represents Granville and Person counties, said he just wanted legislators to know all the facts. ""I represent an agricultural community and I have constituents that want to grow industrial hemp and medical marijuana,"" he said. ""I am certainly not an advocate of legalizing marijuana, but I have constituents that are and farmers that want to grow it."" Why it won’t work As any experienced marijuana grower will tell you, according to the federal government’s Congressional Research Service, it’s imperative that pollen-producing male plants be kept away from female plants. (If you thought you could avoid discussion of gender segregation in a fact-check about hemp farming, and not North Carolina’s new bathroom law, we’re sorry to disappoint.) Pollination creates seeds. The problem is hemp needs seeds to be worthwhile – they can be sold as food or turned into oil – but the opposite is true for marijuana. ""Marijuana growers would not want to plant near a hemp field, since this would result in a harvest that is seedy and lower in THC, and degrade the value of their marijuana crop,"" the Congressional Research Service paper said. So people would need to smoke much more of the altered weed in order to get high – if they could still get high off it at all – and the smoking experience would also become much less pleasant. That’s because of all the extra seeds, which pop when ignited, said Janna Beckerman, a professor of botany and plant pathology at Purdue University. Legally, hemp can’t contain more than 0.3 percent THC. According to the Purdue Hemp Project that Beckerman is a researcher for, that’s about 60 times weaker than the legal marijuana being sold in Colorado. And while hemp-pollinated marijuana likely wouldn’t see its THC content drop all the way to hemp’s virtually nonexistant levels, like Yarborough said, Beckerman said it would be drastically reduced. Oregon State University crop and soil science professor emeritus Russell Karow said growing marijuana in a hemp field would lower the value of the hemp, too, providing further incentives against using the legal crop to hide marijuana. The Congressional Research Service came to the same conclusion. ""The two crops are the same species and will indeed cross-pollinate,"" Karow said. ""This results in seed that will not be useful for either purpose – hemp or marijuana."" Our ruling Yarborough said that if you try to hide a marijuana growing operation in a hemp field, ""it becomes worthless. The THC goes away."" Cross-pollination of hemp and marijuana will cause marijuana's buds to lose much of their high-inducing THC, but the THC won’t go away entirely. Researchers agree that while the drug won’t become completely impotent, it will lose much or all of its worth and would also likely damage the value of the hemp crop.

Mostly True for California initiative's claim: Guns kill 32,000 Americans each year
"," Calls to strengthen California’s gun laws intensified this week after the nation’s deadliest mass shooting in history at an Orlando nightclub. State lawmakers described the tragedy as a call to action to strengthen California’s firearm regulations, considered among the toughest in America. In November, voters in the state will likely be asked to make those laws even tougher, by approving the Safety For All Initiative. That measure is led by Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and is pending signature verification. On the initiative’s website, it claims: ""More than 32,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year."" The statement is followed by the message: ""Gun Violence Is Not Inevitable. The Power To Save Lives Is In Our Hands: Together We Can Keep Our Communities Safe."" We wondered about the eye-popping 32,000 figure and whether any context was missing.  A screenshot of SafetyForAll.com's homepage shows the claim about 32,000 Americans losing their lives to gun violence each year. Our research Much of the Safety For All Initiative is designed to make it more difficult for individuals to obtain ammunition for assault-style weapons, such as those used in recent mass shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando. Here’s what the measure would do, if approved by voters: Require instant background checks for ammunition purchases; strengthen checks for gun purchases and ban the possession of large, detachable military-style magazines; and require the immediate surrender of firearms for people convicted of serious and violent crimes. A spokeswoman for the initiative pointed us to figures from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention. They show nearly 33,000 gun deaths, on average, from 2010 through 2014 in the United States. Of those, more than 62 percent resulted from suicides by guns -- something not mentioned on the Safety For All website. There’s no mention of suicide by guns or suicide prevention efforts in the text of the measure, either. About 34 percent of the gun deaths are from homicides. The remaining four percent resulted from accidents, legal intervention or cases where intent was undetermined. We asked the initiative campaign about the large share of gun deaths from suicide. Dan Newman, a campaign strategist for the lieutenant governor, replied that ""treating ammo sales like guns and screening for dangerous mental illness, taking guns away from people legally prohibited from owning weapons, reporting lost and stolen guns and ammo – these will all reduce gun violence of all kinds, from suicide to mass murder."" In October 2015, PolitiFact Texas checked a similar claim by Hillary Clinton, that ""We lose an average of 90 Americans every day because of guns."" That adds up to the CDC total of more than 32,000. They rated it Mostly True. PolitiFact Texas pointed out that at least once, Clinton has clarified her figure by mentioning suicides; according to a post on her campaign website, she said: ""We lose between 88 and 92 Americans a day from gun violence — homicides, suicides and accidents — and we have to act."" Our ruling The Safety For All Initiative proposes stronger gun and ammunition restrictions in California. On its website, it says ""More than 32,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year."" That sad statistic checks out, based on an examination of data from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention. While the statement is accurate, it needs a key clarification that more than 60 percent of those gun deaths result from suicides.   Much of the Safety For All Initiative is designed to make it more difficult for individuals to obtain ammunition for assault-style weapons, not typically associated with suicides. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Alan Grayson wrongly claims weapon used by Mateen could fire 700 rounds a minute
","Rep. Alan Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat, made a case against assault rifles after the shooting in Orlando, arguing that the gun’s rate of fire is what made the death toll so catastrophic. If the shooter, Omar Mateen, ""was not able to buy a weapon that shoots off 700 rounds in a minute, a lot of those people would still be alive,"" Grayson said June 12, in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett. ""If somebody like him had nothing worse to deal with than a glock pistol which was his other weapon today, he might have killed three or four people and not 50,"" Grayson said. Law enforcement officials have not released specific details regarding the nature of the rifle Mateen used in the shooting as of this fact-check. Law enforcement officials have described it as an ""AR type rifle."" The gun shop owner who sold Mateen the weapon told the New York Post it was a Sig Sauer MCX rifle.   Grayson told PolitiFact he was referring to the AR-15 weapon more generally, which was modeled off the military style M16. All these details matter, and what makes Grayson's claim problematic. Experts told us the weapon Mateen used could not fire 700 rounds in a minute without serious alterations that require the resources of a gun manufacturer. Even if Mateen had those resources, and there is no indication from sounds recorded from the shooting or from investigators that he did, experts are not even sure if Grayson’s 700-rounds-per-minute claim is possible. Experts said that firing 700 rounds per minute is unrealistic due to the time it would take for a shooter to reload magazines and because the gun would overheat. What Grayson said later Both the AR-15 and Sig Sauer MCX rifle are sold for civilian use as a semiautomatic rifle, meaning a shooter has to pull the trigger to fire each round. This is different from an automatic weapon where the shooter can hold down the trigger and shoot multiple rounds. The AR-15 weapon was used in the 2015 San Bernadino and 2012 Sandy Hook shootings, and has since been the subject of controversy, including a lawsuit against an AR-15 manufacturer. Mateen used an ""AR type rifle,"" according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Some people, like Grayson, took that to mean an AR-15. The Sig Sauer MCX, however, looks like an AR-15 and is considered an AR type rifle.  Grayson clarified his specific claim in other interviews to say that rifle Mateen used was only capable of 700 rounds per minute when modified to become an automatic weapon, such as the M16 military version of the civilian AR-15. Grayson told PolitiFact that there are various ways of converting weapons from semi-automatic to automatic, some legal (purchasing a shoulder mount) and others illegal (""machining"" the weapon). Gary Kleck, Florida State University criminologist, said that it would be possible to ""convert"" a semiautomatic rifle into an automatic rifle, but only ""if you had the resources of a modern rifle manufacturer"" and sufficient tools. Kleck’s research on guns recovered by police suggests that rarely happens. If shooters do use an automatic weapon, they probably stole it from a military armory rather than repurposing a civilian version, Kleck said. Theory vs. reality Grayson’s claim distorts what we know about the Orlando shooting and the number of rounds a standard semiautomatic rifle can fire. The 700-round-a-minute figure is only a theoretical benchmark, not something achievable in reality. Army documents list the M16 as having a ""cyclic rate of fire"" of 700-900 rounds per minute. However, the ""cyclic"" rate of fire is a theoretical measurement of speed, not how many rounds could actually be shot out of the gun in 1 minute, said Michael O’Shea, a constitutional law professor at Oklahoma City University. ""That only means how rapidly the firing mechanism operates while there is ammunition in the gun,"" O’Shea said. ""It is not the same as being able to actually discharge 700 rounds of ammunition from the gun in 60 seconds."" For starters, a shooter would have to reload his magazines to achieve that volume — at least 20 times with 30 round magazines or 6 times with 100 round magazines, which are less commonly used, O’Shea said. Grayson told PolitiFact that there are videos online of people shooting at 700-900 rounds per minute. However, we searched online for such videos and found that they actually confirmed O'Shea's point.  The Army document designates the ""maximum effective rate of fire"" — ""the highest rate of fire that can be maintained and still achieve target hits"" — as 150-200 rounds per minute for an automatic M16. Kleck added that, from his research on mass shootings, most shooters rarely fire more than 50 rounds per minute. Even if you could overcome the need to reload — by installing a belt of ammunition — reaching 700 rounds in one minute remains infeasible, said Steven Howard, a lawyer and gun expert who has consulted with various law enforcement agencies. ""In reality, you’ll get to 500 rounds and the gun will just melt,"" Howard said. Our ruling Grayson said that the rifle Mateen used ""shoots off 700 rounds in a minute."" On CNN, he includes this claim without any clarification. In other forums, he noted that his claim is only true for the hypothetical semiautomatic rifle converted to an automatic weapon. Even then, however, experts say the 700-round-per-minute figure is not an accurate portrayal of rounds fired. This is true for many reasons, they said, including reloading time and the potential of overheating the gun. The debate over how assault weapons ought to be regulated is ongoing and contentious, but the claim Grayson uses is nonetheless misleading. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/jun/14/alan-grayson/orlando-democrat-alan-grayson-700-rounds-minute/

Missouri candidate says only half of murders in St. Louis get solved
","Missouri gubernatorial candidate Catherine Hanaway -- eager to showcase her law enforcement chops and touch on the trust issues of police simmering in the wake of Ferguson -- presented what she called a shocking statistic at a recent GOP governor’s debate. Hanaway, who was the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Missouri from 2005 to 2009, discussed restoring trust between police and the communities and addressed crime during a governor’s debate June 6. ""I was shocked when I became U.S. attorney to learn that only half of the murders in the city of St. Louis get solved,"" Hanaway said. Is that true? Hanaway’s policy director, Will Scharf, told us that Hanaway was speaking from ""personal recollection."" But FBI Uniformed Crime Report data largely supports Hanaway’s claim. We sorted the data using the Murder Accountability Project, which mines the FBI data. The most recent data is from 2014. There were 1,470 homicides reported in St. Louis from 2004-14. Of those, 795 were ""cleared."" A cleared offense occurs when at least one person is ""arrested, charged with commission the arrest, and turned over to the court for prosecution (whether following arrest, court summons, or police notice),"" according to the FBI’s website. All three of those requirements must be met for an offense to be considered cleared. Basically, a little over 54 percent of homicides were ""cleared"" in St. Louis between 2004 and 2014. That’s in line with what Hanaway said. We'll note two caveats. First, there is a technical difference between homicide and murder. James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University said that murder is more restrictive term, and homicide includes any killing of a person, even an execution by the state. With murder, there is intent to cause bodily harm, however he said the terms are used interchangeably. Taking this into account, the number Hanaway is touting may be a little different from the data, but David Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said using the word murder in place of homicide is ""completely mainstream.""  ""These terms are used so interchangeably that often the formal authorities don’t even make the distinction."" Kennedy said. Second, Kennedy also said the rate of unsolved criminal homicides is ""shockingly high"" in many cities, so the situation in St. Louis is not all that unique. Our ruling Hanaway said ""only half of the murders in the city of St. Louis get solved."" That’s basically accurate looking at FBI data from 2004-14. We rate this claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5682c82-966a-4646-90d4-df304162a1ac",/factchecks/2016/jun/14/catherine-hanaway/hanaway-right-about-how-many-murder-get-solved-st-/

Lack of a reliable tally from EPA, California hinder Bernie Sanders tap water claim
","The wisdom of using hydraulic fracking, the controversial process of squeezing oil and gas out of rock using pressured fluid, has been one of the issues that separates Democrats Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, with Sanders advocating an outright ban on the technique. Sanders repeated his opposition during a news conference in Spreckels, Calif., in Monterey County, and said it was part of a larger concern about the availability of clean water, which he characterized as ""one of the looming crises"" in the United States and around the world. ""It is not just Flint, Mich., that is struggling with clean water. It is hundred of communities all over this country,"" he said. ""There are tens of thousands of homes right here in California where you turn on the faucet, but you can't drink the water."" ""They have to bring in bottled water, and, by the way, at great expense,"" Sanders said. ""And if we do not act aggressively on fracking and other issues, this problem will only spread."" (There was a moment of confusion during Sanders' comments when someone to Sanders' left injected a comment and, based on that, Sanders said it was tens of thousands just in that county. When we contacted that other person, environmental lawyer Gary Alan Patton, he told PolitiFact that he and Sanders misunderstood each other and the ""tens of thousands"" was not a county number.) For this fact-check, we will look at whether Sanders correctly reported the scope of the problem in California as a whole. The short answer: We couldn't find any clear data. The federal Environmental Protection Agency — with a budget of over $9 billion — said it doesn't have a running tally of households or individuals in the United States or by state who can't drink their tap water. EPA referred us to California's EPA and its State Water Resources Control Board. They don't have a tally either. What the control board does have is an annual report covering 2014 with numbers that are only suggestive of the scope of the drinking water problem in California's 7,789 public water systems. It focuses on the 167 water systems in the state that have had drinking water violations. The only time it counts people is in the sections that list water systems with arsenic, nitrate and nitrite contamination. By our tally, in 2014, 168 water systems serving 158,354 residents were cited at least once for high arsenic concentration. An additional 124 systems serving 36,652 residents were cited for high concentrations of nitrate or nitrite, substances common in fertilizers. In total, those water systems serve just over 195,000 people. With an average household size of 2.58 people, that would be about 75,600 households, putting Sanders in the ""tens of thousands"" ballpark. The problem is saying a water system has been cited for violations in 2014 doesn’t mean those households don’t have drinkable tap water. Some of those violations may have since been corrected. Some of those water systems may have adjusted for the contamination. Consider contamination with arsenic, the legendary poison that, in small doses over a long period of time can cause diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The element usually comes from the erosion of natural deposits. We contacted people in two of the largest systems cited for arsenic contamination. In Arvin, Calif., the levels are so high, the 18,000 or so residents supplied by local water district are drinking bottled or filtered water provided by the city. The schools, parks and the library, for example, have their water filtered. The city is working on three new wells to try to correct the longstanding problem. Yet a few miles northwest, in Lamont, which serves a population of 18,290, people are drinking the water in spite of one well with high arsenic levels. That well is shut down, so the tap water is drinkable. Water district officials are hoping a new well will have low levels so they can blend it with the now-offline well to dilute the arsenic. ""We never had a case where people had to purchase water because it was unsafe to drink,"" said Rolando Marquez, water system supervisor. Point being, they shouldn't be included in any count to assess whether Sanders is correct. But there's another factor that makes the state report even less reliable as a gauge of how many California residents have tap water that's not safe to drink. Between 660,000 and 2 million people in the state rely on unregulated water from home wells that may also be polluted and don't have to be tested. People may be drinking it because the cost to homeowners to treat that water may be prohibitively high. The only official estimate we could find for the state was a 2013 news release from the state water board reporting that, ""More than 95 percent of California’s 38 million residents get their drinking water from a public water supply and, of that number, 98 percent are served safe drinking water, according to CDPH,"" the acronym for the California Department of Public Health. If that means 2 percent are served unsafe drinking water, that works out to about 722,000 residents or roughly 280,000 households. That's hundreds of thousands, not tens of thousands. If that estimate is correct, Sanders is low-balling the tap water pollution problem in The Golden State. When we contacted the Sanders campaign, they didn't have any hard numbers either, just media reports, including an Associated Press story about 2 million people living near groundwater containing uranium (but that's untreated water and the number goes beyond California), another AP story reporting that 57 water systems in California had too much lead in their drinking water (but no indication on how many households they served) and a story from the Visalia Times Delta saying that nearly one fifth of groundwater used for public drinking supplies is polluted (again, that's before treatment). Our ruling Sanders said, ""There are tens of thousands of homes right here in California where you turn on the faucet, but you can't drink the water."" But surprisingly, neither the federal nor state governments has a reliable tally for public water supplies, never mind private wells that are not regulated. Clearly California has a lot of polluted water, but in many cases that water can be treated or mixed with unpolluted water to bring the contaminants down to safe levels. Thus, the number of households with undrinkable tap water remains uncertain. Sanders is right about the problem but his assessment of its scope — tens of thousands of households — lacks good data. For that reason, we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2016/jun/14/bernie-sanders/lack-reliable-tally-epa-california-hinder-bernie-s/

Hillary Clinton says anti-Muslim hate crimes tripled after Paris, San Bernardino
","During her speech after an ISIS-inspired attack on an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Hillary Clinton pledged to fight terrorism but also cautioned Americans not to see the vast majority of Muslims as enemies. ""It's no coincidence that hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques have tripled after Paris and San Bernardino,"" she said during her June 13, 2016, speech. Is she correct that attacks have tripled? We located calculations published in December 2015 by Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University-San Bernardino, that generally support Clinton's assertion, and her campaign confirmed that Levin’s data was their source. According to the FBI, a hate crime is defined as ""criminal offenses motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias against"" a particular group such as a religion, race or sexual orientation. In all, 45 states and the federal government have a hate crime statute, but the FBI hate-crime data also includes crimes committed in states without an official hate-crime law. However, the reporting of crimes to the FBI is more spotty, because reporting by local jurisdictions is voluntary. A 2012 study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that there were 293,800 hate crimes annually across the country, with 60 percent of them not reported to police. In recent years, anti-Muslim incidents have ranked second to anti-Jewish incidents among all anti-religious hate crimes since 9/11, Levin added. As for the spike Clinton referred to, Levin calculated that the number of reported anti-Islamic hate crimes during a five-year period before the Paris and San Bernardino attacks was 12.6 per month. However, in the month-long period between Nov. 13 to Dec. 13, 2015 -- after the Paris attacks and in a period that included the San Bernardino attacks -- there were at least 37 suspected hate crimes. ""The 37 suspected hate crime cases are 2.94 times the average calendar monthly number seen from 2010-14,"" Levin wrote. That’s very close to ""triple,"" as Clinton put it. He added that ""this appears to be the highest monthly total since 2001, when there were 481 anti-Muslim hate crimes reported for the year, with most taking place after 9/11."" Levin told PolitiFact that such spikes are not a new phenomenon, citing incidents after racially charged events in the 1980s in the New York City neighborhoods of Howard Beach and Bensonhurst, and after the riots that followed the beating of black motorist Rodney King in the early 1990s in Los Angeles. ""There is often a significant spike following a catalytic event,"" Levin said. We will make one caveat about Clinton’s comment. It’s possible to read her phrasing -- that such incidents ""have tripled after Paris and San Bernardino"" -- to mean that these incidents tripled and then remained at that elevated level. But the data in Levin’s study doesn’t include the months so far in 2016, so it’s impossible to know that for sure. Levin did say that history shows that after a spike, the level may drop, but not to the level prior to the spike. For instance, after the 9/11 attacks, the number of reported hate crimes against Muslims did eventually decline, but not to the pre-9/11 level. Our ruling Clinton said that ""hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques have tripled after Paris and San Bernardino."" Calculations by the director of an academic center found that the number did triple after those attacks. But it’s worth noting that his data does not show whether or not they remained at that elevated level, or for how long -- something that would be a reasonable interpretation of what Clinton said. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/jun/14/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-anti-muslim-hate-crimes-tripl/

Rob Wittman wrongly says each military dog saves 150 to 200 lives
","We love a heroic dog story, and this one caught our eye: ""On average, each U.S. military working dog saves the lives of between 150 and 200 servicemen and women over the span of his career,"" U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-1st, wrote in a recent Facebook post. Below the comment was a picture of Wittman petting Valerie, a service dog, at a U.S. Navy contractors’ expo held May 16-18, a few miles from Capitol Hill. Wittman noted that he had backed legislation to help reunite military dogs, when they retire, with their handlers. ""Brave and independent pups like Valerie deserve the hero’s treatment,"" he wrote. No doubt, military dogs deserve their due. But we wondered whether Wittman gave the canines too much credit in claiming each one averages saving 150 to 200 lives during their careers. Farahn Morgan, the congressman’s press secretary, told us Wittman got the figure from the American Humane Association. She provided a news release the organization sent in June 2015. It praised Congress for passing legislation that allows the military to fly service dogs back to the U.S. after retirement to be reunited with their handlers or adopted. Transportation previously had been handled by private fundraising organizations, including the humane association. ""The nation’s military working dogs, each of whom saves the lives of between 150-200 servicemen and women in the course of their career, are one step closer to being guaranteed treatment as the heroes they are,"" the humane association news release began. We asked the humane association for its source of the statistic. Spokesman Mark Stubis told us the association got the numbers a few years ago from ""a number of organizations that were working with military dog adoptions."" He referred us to several news reports that also cited statistics but offered no specific source. They included: The Wall Street Journal, Feb. 25, 2012: ""It is hard to quantify how many soldiers have been saved by canine detection skills, but estimates range from 150 to 1,800 lives per dog."" People, March 15, 2010: ""‘If one dog finds one explosive, he’s saved at least 150 lives,’ says Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Ekali Brooks."" CNN, Jan. 6, 2012: ""’These dogs are more soldiers than they are equipment,’ said Debbie Kandoll, founder of Military Working Dog Adoptions. Kandoll, who helps civilians adopt military working dogs, estimates that the average war dog saves 150 soldier lives during its service.’"" CNN said that, according to the Department of Defense, there are 2,700 military dogs serving worldwide. The Journal offered the same number, although no source was cited. So, Let's do some math: If 2,700 military dogs saved between 150 and 200 lives each, how many service member's lives would be saved? The answer: Between 405,000 and 540,000. That’s roughly the same or more than the number of U.S. service members who were killed during World War II - pegged at 405,399 by the U.S. government. We asked the Department of Defense if it could verify that each military dog saves between 150 and 200 lives. Spokesman Eric Pahon repudiated the claim. ""The DoD has not conducted a study and we feel that the number is likely greatly inflated over what the actual numbers might be,"" Pahon wrote in an email. Pahon said there are about 1,740 military working dogs, not including those belonging to special forces such as Army Green Berets and Navy SEALs, or those assigned to security details such as the Pentagon police. He declined to release the total number, citing security concerns. Pahon said the average career of a military dog lasts eight to nine years. Many of them are trained as bomb sniffers. ""Most of our explosive-detecting (dogs) have never found anything except explosive training aids because they have never encountered a live explosive device,"" he said. ""Those that have found devices were actually conducting deployed operations at the time in (Afghanistan or Iraq). For those that are found, the typical device in a roadway or building would kill far fewer people than 150 people. As such, the (dog) would need to find several devices or bomb-making components to reach the 150-200 number and that would only apply to very few dogs."" Pahon said that while the contributions of the bomb sniffers are not quantifiable, ""they are an invaluable asset for freedom of movement of our ground patrols."" He added that many of the dogs aren’t bomb sniffers but are trained to detect drugs or walk patrols. ""These are critical duties that are not directly life-saving, but contribute to overall mission success and safety,"" Pahon wrote. Our ruling Wittman said, ""On average, each U.S. military working dog saves the lives of between 150 and 200 servicemen and women over the span of his career."" This is a myth that’s been spread for years, often by organizations promoting the adoption of retired military dogs. Wittman says he picked up the figure from the American Humane Association’s website. Nobody seems to know the original source of the numbers. Wittman and others who state the number unequivocally fail in their burden of proof. The Department of Defense says it never has quantified the number of lives saved by military dogs and that the 150- to 200-per-dog number ""is likely greatly inflated."" Think about it: If the number was correct, it would mean the dogs are saving the lives of more than 400,000 service members every eight to nine years.

Scott Walker's support of Donald Trump: Some inconsistencies
","On the same day chatter surfaced about how Scott Walker could still become the Republican presidential nominee, the Wisconsin governor made comments that raised questions about his support of the party’s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump. Walker’s comments on June 8, 2016 prompted headlines such as these: Politico: ""Walker backs away from endorsing Trump"" Wall Street Journal: ""Scott Walker withholds Donald Trump endorsement"" So, barely a month before the GOP nominates its candidate for president, has Walker changed his position on Trump? Cue the Flip-O-Meter, which determines whether a politician has changed positions on an issue. The backdrop Talk among Republicans about replacing Trump grew in the wake of racial remarks Trump made about a Hispanic federal judge in California who is handling two lawsuits filed in against Trump University. Yahoo reported that Walker ""has been increasingly mentioned as a possible replacement."" And the conservative website RedState said there were rumors of Walker being open to accepting the nomination at the convention. Walker dismissed the talk. But the new reports on Walker’s viability as a Trump replacement were fueled by Walker’s own comments the same day. So, let’s look at where Walker has been on Trump, starting with when Walker himself was still in the race. Walker’s early comments Walker launched his presidential bid in July 2015 and was quickly considered a frontrunner, even in the crowded GOP field. The next month, he was on stage with Trump and eight other hopefuls for the first GOP debate, held in Cleveland. The candidates were asked to raise their hand if they would not pledge to back the party's nominee and swear off an independent run. Trump was the only one to raise his hand. In other words, Walker pledged he would back the GOP nominee. Of course, at that stage, Walker himself hoped to be his party’s choice, and it would be months before Trump became the presumptive nominee. Walker ended his presidential bid in September 2015, amid campaign cash-flow problems and a drop in the polls,  Ahead of Wisconsin’s primary in April 2016, Trump was harshly critical of Walker, who endorsed U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Soon questions turned to whether Walker would back Trump. April 20, 2016: Walker told reporters: ""I will support the Republican running against Hillary Clinton in the fall -- whoever that is."" Asked if he would do so even if Trump were the nominee, he said: ""Yeah. To me, I think it's preferable to have a Republican nominee over Hillary Clinton."" May 4, 2016: Alluding to the first GOP debate, Walker told reporters the day after Cruz dropped out: ""I stood on the stage in Cleveland and said that I would support the nominee. I’ve said it repeatedly since then and I’ll be supporting the Republican nominee once that’s officially set at the convention against Hillary Clinton."" June 6, 2016: The Post-Crescent in Appleton reported that Walker said he would have no problem supporting Trump even though ""he wasn't my first choice."" He said in the interview: ""There are issues, not the least of which lately with his statements about the judge he commented on, which I just fundamentally disagree with him on, so just saying that I'll support him over Hillary Clinton doesn't mean I embrace all the things that he says or all the ways that he says it."" So, Walker initially declared he would support the Republican nominee. Then, months later, as it became clear that Trump was closing in on the nomination, Walker repeatedly said he would support Trump -- though on at least one occasion he said his support once the GOP nomination becomes ""officially set."" Now to the Walker comments that made national headlines. Walker’s latest comments June 7, 2016: The Wall Street Journal headline about Walker withholding a Trump endorsement was based on comments Walker made to reporters that were highlighted in a report by WKOW-TV in Madison. Walker denounced Trump’s comments about the judge and said he wanted Trump himself to renounce them, according to a reporter’s recording of Walker’s remarks. A reporter then asked: ""Would that influence your decision at all on whether or not to back him as the nominee?"" Walker said: ""Again, we’ll watch and see what happens. We’ll be watching closely. There’s still quite some time until he’s even the nominee, so we’ll have to wait and see."" Asked what would cause him not to support Trump, Walker said: ""Well, again, he’s not yet the nominee. Officially that won't happen until the middle of July, and so for me that's kind of the time frame on that. In particular, I want to make sure that he renounces what he says -- at least in regards to this judge."" Walker added: ""I think for a lot of us, not just Republicans in general, we want to see what he’s going to do between now and the time the convention comes. The sad fact is -- it’s just sad in American that we have such poor choices right now."" June 8, 2016: After another question-and-answer session with reporters, the Associated Press reported, that Walker was wavering in his support of Trump and that he dodged a question on the issue. Walker was asked, according to a reporter's recording of that exchange: ""Do you still support him (Trump) as the nominee?"" Walker began his response by saying: ""Well, right now I'm focused on calling out, as I have the last couple days, the fact that I believe what he said about the judge is wrong -- not as a Republican, not as a political person, but I think it's just wrong as an American."" Walker went on at some length criticizing Trump’s remarks, ending by saying: ""He needs to make it abundantly clear to the American people that he does not embrace those ideas. And I think it’s particularly important between now and the convention that he does that."" Our rating Dating back to August 2015, when he himself was a candidate for president, Walker said he would support the Republican presidential nominee. And several times over the next 10 months, Walker repeated that pledge -- including as it was becoming clear that Trump would be the presumptive nominee. But on two consecutive days in June 2016, Walker shifted somewhat. Questioned about Trump by reporters, Walker would not state his support as he had in the past. Instead, while criticizing Trump, he emphasized that Trump is not yet the nominee. Our definition of Half Flip is a partial change of position or inconsistent statements. That fits here.

New York Times photo error provokes social media criticism on Gaza child
","Nearly 70 children were reported to have been killed during an 11-day battle in May between Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza. Sixty-seven were killed in Israeli air strikes in Gaza. Two children were killed in Israel from rockets sent by Hamas. On May 28, the New York Times published a print article that featured a front-page collage of images of the children who were killed. But a recent post by a Facebook page called ""Stop Antisemitism"" claims there’s a discrepancy with one of the images, and alleges that the newspaper used an outdated stock photo to represent one of the children. ""SHAMEFUL,"" the post says. ""The New York Times publish a 2015 stock photo of a young girl claiming Israeli forces killed her during last week's war with Hamas."" The social media post includes an image of the Times’ front page with a red line drawn from one of the images in the collage —  a photo of a smiling young girl with dark hair — to a screenshot of the same image in a social media post from 2017. ""Apparently we ‘killed’ her twice,"" a caption reads. A separate image included in the post shows screenshots of web search results that bring up the same photo on Pinterest, an image-sharing platform. A Facebook post says the New York Times used a 2015 stock image of a young girl and claimed that Israeli forces killed her during recent conflicts. While the photo appeared on some image-sharing services, it’s not necessarily a stock image.  The Times did mistakenly use an image of a different girl that was taken in the Palestinian territories in 2015 to identify Al-Masri.  The newspaper issued a correction about the photo in print and on its website, and replaced the inaccurate photo with an image of Al-Masri that was provided by her family.  The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

The CDC did not change its criteria for what is considered a breakthrough positive COVID case
","Widely shared social media posts wrongly claim that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its testing parameters for vaccinated individuals so that fewer cases of COVID-19 infections would be recorded. One such post on Twitter, which was also shared across Facebook, questioned why the CDC would ""deliberately lower the PCR test threshold while no longer recording asymptomatic cases"" for those who are vaccinated. But that’s not what happened. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, PCR stands for polymerase chain reaction and is one method available to test for active COVID-19, by screening nasal and throat samples for the presence of viral RNA. The National Human Genome Research Institute described PCR as ""‘molecular photocopying,’... a fast and inexpensive technique used to ‘amplify’ — copy — small segments of DNA."" The PCR method is widely hailed in the medical community as the gold standard when it comes to reliable and accurate COVID-19 testing. Using this method, samples are replicated again and again so that any viral genetic material can be more easily detected.  The Twitter claim appears to stem from the CDC’s announcement that, starting May 14, it changed the way it monitors and reports ""breakthrough"" COVID-19 cases. Breakthrough cases are infections diagnosed in people who have been fully vaccinated. The agency said it would focus its monitoring of reported vaccine breakthrough cases only on those cases that involved patients who were hospitalized or died. At the time, the change spawned a similarly False social media claim that the government’s action was intended to obscure data and paint a rosier picture of the outbreak. Rather, the CDC said the move was intended to provide a better means of zeroing in on more complete data on the most concerning cases, since not all people with breakthrough infections can be identified — particularly those with asymptomatic or mild illness who do not get tested. The new approach also is part of an effort to collect more data on variant strains of the virus. The agency set a benchmark to determine which positive breakthrough samples are further analyzed for evidence of a variant. That benchmark is described as a ""cycle threshold value"" — that’s the number of cycles necessary to spot the virus and is commonly abbreviated as ""Ct."" For a breakthrough case to be further analyzed, the test must have a Ct value of 28 or lower. The measure indicates a high level of virus. But the move did not signify a ""lower threshold"" for what is considered a positive COVID case, as the Twitter claim suggests. CDC spokeswoman Jade Fulce said in a statement that, when it comes to determining which positive samples are assessed for presence of a variant strain, any Ct value higher than 28 is pretty much moot since it indicates the viral load is too small. ""The criteria for determining if a sample is positive is defined by the data submitted to FDA for the Emergency Use Authorization. This criteria has not changed nor does it change whether the case is a breakthrough case or not,"" Fulce said. ""The Ct value ≤28 is not used to define whether a specimen is positive or negative for COVID. It is only used for determining whether a specimen that tests positive could be submitted for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. It is not specific to vaccine breakthrough cases."" The post claims that the CDC lowered the benchmark cycle threshold used to determine what’s considered a positive COVID case, which is not true.

No, emails to Fauci don’t show early agreement that virus was man-made
","The release of thousands of emails to and from U.S. infectious disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci has fueled claims that the virus behind COVID-19 was man-made. BuzzFeed and the Washington Post received the emails in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, and both published articles on June 1. Fauci’s critics quickly responded. ""Dr Fauci exposed for the fraud he is,"" said a June 2 Facebook post from the WTF Files. ""Fauci's fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured.""  The post included an email from Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif. It underlines last few words of this quote from his Jan. 31, 2020, message to Fauci: ""The unusual features of the virus make up a really small part of the genome (<0.1%) so one has to look really closely at all of the sequences to see that some of the features (potentially) look engineered."" A smoking gun? No. In that same email, Andersen said, ""There are still further analyses to be done, so those opinions could still change."" And a little over a month later, they did. In a March 17, 2020, article in Nature Medicine, Andersen and his colleagues wrote, ""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus."" After the email release, Andersen tweeted June 1 that ""we seriously considered a lab leak a possibility,"" and ""what the email shows, is a clear example of the scientific process."" The WTF Facebook post includes another email to Fauci from a professor of dermatology who voiced his suspicion that the virus could have been released from a lab in Wuhan. The email gives no data to support that suspicion. Plucking emails from the BuzzFeed and Washington Post trove inspired other social media posts suspicious of Fauci. Instagram posts drew attention to an email to Fauci from independent researcher Adam Gaertner. In one June 2 post, the email’s subject line, ""Coronavirus bioweapon production method,"" and the phrase ""This is how the virus was created"" are underlined in red. But despite Gaertner’s use of technical terms, including ""adjusted virions"" and  ""conformational rearrangements,"" the email contains no evidence to prove the point. Gaertner has appeared on web programs that link vaccines to the creation of superspreaders, and he promotes the use of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin to treat COVID-19. Some studies find ivermectin effective in treating COVID-19; others have found no impact. One Instagram user who shared the image posted an update saying, ""Just to be clear this email appears to have been sent to Fauci through public inquiry, so it doesn't necessarily link Fauci to anything."" A Facebook post says, ""Fauci's fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured."" The only email that came close to matching that claim noted that while some evidence suggested the virus might be man-made, more work was needed and that opinion could change. The email presented a possibility — a starting point for more research — not a conclusion. The man who wrote that email concluded that the virus developed naturally in a scientific journal article in March 2020. We rate this claim False.

""I hear all the folks on TV saying, ‘Why doesn’t Biden get this done?’ Well, because Biden only has a majority of effectively four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate, with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends. But we’re not giving up."" Biden didn’t specify which Democratic senators he had in mind, and the White House didn’t respond to an inquiry for this article. But observers widely assumed that he was referring to Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, whose words and positions have not always been in lockstep with Biden’s. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., surrounded by reporters at the Capitol on May 26, 2021. (AP) Manchin effectively killed the nomination of Neera Tanden to be director of the Office of Management and Budget by signaling that he would not vote to confirm her, and he flexed his muscle in the crafting of Biden’s relief package, first by voicing concerns about a national $15 hourly minimum wage (a hike that never made the final bill) and then by delaying the measure for hours over the scope of unemployment benefits. Manchin did, however, vote for the bill in the end.  But the biggest issue on which Manchin and Sinema have broken with other Senate Democrats is on the future of the filibuster, the longstanding procedural tool in the U.S. Senate that allows a minority of 41 senators to block action on a bill. Both Manchin and Sinema have generally said they support keeping the filibuster, even though many Democrats in the 50-50 Senate would like to end its use on at least some legislation. Because of the Democrats’ narrow margin, Manchin and Sinema’s position effectively blocks that option for Democrats. However, in his Tulsa remarks, Biden was wrong to say that Manchin and Sinema — or any other Senate Democrat, for that matter — ""voted more"" with Republicans than with Biden. According to FiveThirtyEight vote tallies through May 28, both Manchin and Sinema have voted 100% with Biden. That’s not only a perfect score, but it’s a slightly higher party unity score than the ones earned by a number of liberals, including Sens.

Manchin and Sinema support continued use of the filibuster, a position that imperils key elements of Biden’s agenda.

A social media post using old Fauci email falsely claims that Fauci ‘lied’ about mask wearing
","A release of emails that Dr. Anthony Fauci sent during the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak has triggered a new round of misleading posts on social media. A widely shared Instagram post from June 2 reads ""Everyone was lied to."" It accompanies an image of a tweet that shows a Feb. 5, 2020, email authored by Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, along with this assessment by the author of the tweet: ""#Fauci says masks aren't needed unless you're sick and notes the #SARS_CoV_2 virus is so small it passes easily between #mask fibers. #Fauciemails"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The email cited in the post was from early in the outbreak, before it was declared a pandemic, when the expert consensus on mask wearing was much different than it is today. Within two months, Fauci and other public health authorities were recommending mask wearing. The Washington Post on June 1 published a news article based on 866 pages of Fauci’s emails from March and April 2020 that the newspaper said it obtained as part of a Freedom of Information Act request. The same day, BuzzFeed News published a news story it said was based on 3,200 pages of Fauci’s emails from January to June 2020 that it obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The Instagram post included a screenshot of an email posted by BuzzFeed News that Fauci sent Feb. 5, 2020, in response to questions from Sylvia Burwell. Newsweek reported that Burwell is the same woman who was health and human services secretary under President Barack Obama. Fauci wrote: ""Masks are really for infected people to prevent them from spreading infection to people who are not infected rather than protecting uninfected people from acquiring infection. The typical mask you buy in the drug store is not really effective in keeping out virus, which is small enough to pass through material. It might, however, provide some slight benefit in keep out gross droplets if someone coughs or sneezes on you. I do not recommend that you wear a mask, particularly since you are going to a very low risk location. Your instincts are correct, money is best spent on medical countermeasures such as diagnostics and vaccines."" It’s important to remember the time frame around when Fauci sent the email. It was two weeks after the first U.S. coronavirus case was announced in Washington state, on Jan. 21, 2020, and five weeks after China confirmed the existence of a new virus. The World Health Organization didn’t declare COVID-19 a pandemic until March 11. It’s also important to acknowledge that guidance on mask wearing changed over time. Early in the coronavirus outbreak, guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said people shouldn’t wear face masks unless they had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. ""This is to protect others from the risk of getting infected,"" the guidance stated. Mask-wearing was discouraged because officials said masks had little value in preventing the general public from contracting the disease. That changed on April 3, 2020, when the CDC recommended wearing masks in public places where social distancing can be difficult. Officials at the time cited clearer findings that showed the virus could be transmitted by people who showed no symptoms. Fauci also changed his guidance, and began recommending masks be worn. On the day the CDC announced its change, he said of mask wearing: ""If everybody does that, we’re each protecting each other.""  By mid-March 2021, with masks a part of daily life, PolitiFact found that the research was clear that masks work. They are most effective as ""source control,"" which means preventing infected people from spreading the virus to other people. While masks cannot block some very tiny coronavirus particles that are in the air, multiple systematic reviews, ecological studies and laboratory studies have shown that masks reduce the spread of COVID-19. The advice to wear masks remained in force, even for people who were vaccinated, until mid-May 2021. Amid widespread use of vaccines and falling case counts, federal health officials revised the guidance again, saying that ""fully vaccinated people can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing,"" except in places such as airports where required by government regulations. A widely shared Instagram post said that an email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows ""everyone was lied to"" about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  The post cites an email Fauci sent Feb. 5, 2020, when the consensus among public health experts was for people generally not to wear masks unless they had symptoms of illness. At the time, researchers did not know that people without symptoms were spreading the virus. The guidance from Fauci and other experts changed in April 2020, as more evidence about the virus and its transmission emerged, and mask wearing was widely recommended.

Fact-checking Barack Obama on the Senate filibuster
","During an interview with New York Times opinion writer Ezra Klein, former President Barack Obama took aim at the filibuster — the Senate procedural tool that allows a minority of 41 senators to block action on a bill — on the grounds that it’s undemocratic. ""The filibuster, if it does not get reformed, still means that maybe 30% of the population potentially controls the majority of Senate seats,"" Obama told Klein. ""And so if you say that 30% of the country is irreconcilably wrong, then it’s going to be hard to govern."" It wasn’t the first time that Obama has criticized the filibuster since leaving office. At the eulogy for John Lewis, the civil rights activist and congressman from Georgia who died in 2020, Obama called the filibuster a ""Jim Crow relic."" In the transcript of the interview with Klein, this passage about the filibuster included a link to a Washington Post analysis of the differences between population and representation in the Senate. However, the Post article doesn’t precisely support what Obama said.  We reached out to Obama’s post-presidential press office but did not hear back. Instead, we crunched the numbers from the 2020 Census and concluded that Obama’s overall point had merit but that he misstated the details. In particular, Obama said that states with a small percentage of the population could control ""the majority of Senate seats."" Given today’s partisan tendencies in each state, controlling an actual majority of seats would not be feasible for that small a percentage. However, a small percentage of the population could control enough seats to successfully wield the filibuster, which effectively gives them control over whether a majority can pass legislation. The Constitution gives each state two senators, regardless of population, so Wyoming and Vermont have the same representation in the chamber as California and Texas, which have more than 30 times as many people. The Post article cited in the transcript was headlined, ""By 2040, two-thirds of Americans will be represented by 30% of the Senate."" That’s 20 years in the future, but the article goes on to note that even today, the largest 15 states have 66% of the nation’s population, but just 30 seats in the Senate. While the article’s conclusion is generally consistent with Obama’s point, it doesn’t have anything to do with the filibuster or the 60-vote threshold to end one. Rather, the article looked at representation throughout the entire chamber. More importantly, the headline finding from the article is purely numerical, and ignores which party currently holds the smallest states’ Senate seats. In reality, those 35 smaller states have selected a mix of Republican and Democratic senators, so these states would not be likely to form a unified coalition. But there are ways to look at the question of whether senators from a bloc of smaller states could effectively use the filibuster to steer the Senate for one party. One way is to ask: What is the smallest share of the U.S. population whose senators could block legislation by mounting a successful filibuster, once you factor in the prevailing party affiliation? For this analysis, we used the current partisan breakdown of the Senate. The results could change if seats flip in the next election, or if partisan trends in some states evolve. We looked at the smallest 21 states that currently have two senators from the same party — 21 because that’s the minimum number of states that would allow one party to prevail in a filibuster, and the same party because in the six states with mixed delegations, the senators’ votes would likely cancel each other out. (We counted the Senate’s two independent members, Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, as Democrats, since they caucus with the Democrats.) The 21 smallest states that have two Republican senators account for 29% of the U.S. population. So, by themselves, these states could muster 42 votes to sustain a filibuster, thereby overruling the 71% of the population represented by the other 58 senators. The 21 smallest states with two Democratic senators account for 39% of the U.S. population, meaning that Democrats from these states could mount a filibuster that thwarts senators representing the remaining 61% of the population. So Obama’s remark is a reasonable assessment of how much muscle a fraction of states can flex in order to block legislation in the Senate. But Obama’s claim that ""30% of the population potentially controls the majority of Senate seats"" overreaches. In the Senate’s current makeup, 29% to 39% of the population could control 42 seats — but not a majority of seats in the 100-seat chamber. In reality, neither party today can muster an actual majority, 51 seats, using just states that have unified partisan control of their Senate delegation.  Adding Texas and California to the previous tally, the 22 states that currently have two Republican senators represent 38% of the population, and the 22 states with two Democratic senators represent 51% of the population. (The other six states have mixed representation.) These groupings of states produce only 44 seats for either party — not a majority. In the big picture, however, Obama has a legitimate point, said Josh Ryan, a Utah State University political scientist and specialist in Congress. ""Essentially a very small population of the country gets to veto legislation preferred by a large majority,"" Ryan said. ""They don't get to control the Senate, but they get to control what passes the Senate."" Obama said, ""The filibuster, if it does not get reformed, still means that maybe 30% of the population potentially controls the majority of Senate seats."" In the Senate’s current makeup, senators representing 29% to 39% of the U.S. population would be sufficient to mount a filibuster and block a vote on legislation, in a sense controlling what can be passed in the chamber. However, an alliance of states with a combined population that small couldn’t secure a majority of seats in the chamber, unless you ignore today’s strong partisan leanings in most states.

Yes, pay for CEOs has far outpaced compensation for average workers
","It’s not often that you’d ever see Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes and Republican U.S. Sen Ron Johnson agreeing with each other. But on one issue, Barnes joked on Twitter, the two appear to be at least somewhat in sync.  Johnson, the senior senator from Wisconsin, had said in an interview with Madison-based WKOW-TV that wages are rising too much too quickly, which he argued could lead to inflation.  Barnes, who is a possible candidate to run against Johnson in 2022, had a different increase in wages in mind. ""He may not know it, and surely didn’t mean to raise the point but in a way, he’s somewhat right?"" Barnes tweeted May 23, 2021 of Johnson. ""Since 1978, CEO compensation rose over 1,000% and only 11.9% for average workers.""  Is the second portion of his tweet — that wage increases for CEOs have far outpaced increases for the average employee — correct?  Let’s check it out.  When asked to provide evidence for the claim, a staffer in Barnes’s office sent a report from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington, D.C.  The August 2019 report reviewed pay for CEOs and average workers at America’s top 350 firms through 2018. It calculated findings based on two measures: wages based on stock options realized, which fluctuates with the stock market, and based on stock options granted.  Under the latter measure, the average CEO’s annual wage grew 1,007.5% between 1978 and 2018, as Barnes said. It grew 940.3% under the ""stock options realized"" measure. Comparatively, the wages of the average private-sector employee at those companies increased 11.9% during those four decades, according to the report.  CEOs out-compensated workers by a ratio of more than 200 to 1 in 2018. It’s not the widest gap in history, which came in 2000 when CEO wages were nearly 400 times that of the average worker. But it is wider than it was a few decades ago, when those wages were about 58 times that of the typical worker.  CEO pay has escalated like this because the top-ranking executives have the power to set pay, the study’s authors argue, contributing to rising wealth inequality.  Barnes said CEO compensation has risen more than 1,000% since 1978, while wages for the average worker have only increased 11.9%.  That’s in line with findings from the Economic Policy Institute report.  We rate his claim True.

Social media posts repeat false information about mask guidance for unvaccinated people
","Masks have been a hot topic throughout the pandemic, and when guidance on their use is updated, a fresh wave of misinformation often follows. That was the case when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on May 13 that fully vaccinated people can forgo wearing masks in most settings. One post shared widely on Facebook says, ""So the unvaxxed have to wear mask (sic) to protect the vaxxinated.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence to suggest that health experts recommend masks for unvaccinated people in order to protect vaccinated people. On the contrary, the rationale for unvaccinated people to continue wearing masks is in large part to protect other unvaccinated or not-fully-vaccinated people. Wearing a mask while unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated reduces the spread of respiratory droplets that travel in the air when coughing, sneezing, talking, shouting or singing, according to the CDC. It also helps prevent the spread of the virus by unvaccinated or not-fully-vaccinated people who have COVID-19 but are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic.  While the CDC’s shift in its stance on masks surprised some, the decision was based on increasing vaccinations, declining cases, new research since March showing the efficacy of vaccination and real-world evidence from other countries. ""A growing body of evidence indicates that people fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are less likely to have asymptomatic infection or to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others,"" the CDC reported.  As of May 30, 40.7% of the total U.S. population was fully vaccinated against COVID-19, leaving a large swath of the population remaining to be fully protected. Some people are not eligible to be vaccinated, including children under 12 years old, and the data is still limited about the effectiveness of vaccines for those who are immunocompromised.  Though COVID-19 case counts in the U.S. have declined dramatically, on May 29, the seven-day average for new daily cases was still more than 18,000 per day.  Those cases ""are occurring mostly in the increasingly narrow slice of the unprotected population,"" according to a data analysis by The Washington Post. In the U.S., the current case rate among unvaccinated residents is similar to the case rate for all residents on Jan. 1. A Facebook post says, ""So the unvaxxed have to wear mask (sic) to protect the vaxxinated.""  There is no evidence to support the claim that mask recommendations are for the benefit of the vaccinated.

Posts falsely claim Biden and Harris didn’t say ‘one word’ about service members for Memorial Day
","Memorial Day weekend is widely celebrated across America as the unofficial start of summer. But the Monday federal holiday is a more solemn occasion: a day to honor and mourn military personnel who died in the service of their country. A post circulating on Facebook suggests that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris completely disregarded the true meaning of the holiday. ""Not one word about vets. Not one word about our fallen heroes. Not one word about the troops. Not one word about the USA. Not one word about Memorial Day and what it means. Joe and Kamala - you are embarrassing,"" the May 30 post reads.  It features screenshots of two tweets posted by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on May 29.  ""Enjoy the long weekend,"" Harris wrote in her post.  ""Stay cool this weekend, folks,"" Biden posted, along with a photo of him holding an ice cream cone. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Other social media users also seized on the two tweets to argue that Biden and Harris ignored the holiday’s meaning, and those claims were circulating throughout the weekend and into the next day.  A May 31 Instagram post shows photos of Biden and Harris with the text of their tweets and placed them alongside images of people mourning at military gravesites. A Facebook post shared by Students for Trump on the same day features a photo illustration of Biden, Harris and their tweets alongside a gravestone marked ""fallen service men and women."" The caption says: ""ZERO mention of the brave men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice for us. ZERO mention of the reason why we have this long weekend. ZERO mention of the families mourning for those who died in combat."" The social media posts give the impression that Biden and Harris did nothing to commemorate the holiday. That’s not the case. While their May 29 tweets hinted at the fun-related aspects of Memorial Day weekend, and struck some as insensitive, Biden and Harris both made multiple statements honoring the military throughout the weekend and participated in the annual wreath-laying Memorial Day service at Arlington National Cemetery. On May 28, prior to her tweet, Harris delivered the commencement address to graduates of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., where she saluted all branches of the military. ""You are a fierce fighting force,"" she told the graduates. ""You are idealists in the truest sense. You are the embodiment of American aspiration."" Two days later, she tweeted: ""Throughout our history our service men and women have risked everything to defend our freedoms and our country. As we prepare to honor them on Memorial Day, we remember their service and their sacrifice."" Throughout our history our service men and women have risked everything to defend our freedoms and our country. As we prepare to honor them on Memorial Day, we remember their service and their sacrifice. That tribute was posted several hours before the Facebook post accusing Harris of saying ""not one word"" about Memorial Day appeared, and hours before former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley called Harris ""unfit"" for her tweet wishing Americans a good weekend. On Memorial Day, Harris wrote: ""We honor those members of our military who sacrificed their lives in order to defend our freedoms. We owe these heroes — and their loved ones — everything. Not just on Memorial Day. Every day."" We honor those members of our military who sacrificed their lives in order to defend our freedoms. We owe these heroes—and their loved ones—everything. Not just on Memorial Day. Every day. pic.twitter.com/bAbl6cxxw1 On May 30, Biden delivered remarks in Delaware for a Memorial Day observance at War Memorial Plaza, near the Delaware Memorial Bridge. ""I know how much the loss hurts,"" said Biden, whose son Beau, an Iraq War veteran, died of brain cancer in 2015. ""I know the black hole it leaves in the middle of your chest. It feels like you may get sucked into it and not come out.""  On Twitter, Biden wrote: ""We have a sacred obligation as a nation to always honor the memory of those we’ve lost — and to support their families. That is the vow we make each year on Memorial Day."" We have a sacred obligation as a nation to always honor the memory of those we’ve lost — and to support their families.That is the vow we make each year on Memorial Day. ""Each year, Memorial Day offers us a chance to reflect on the enormity of the sacrifices that generation after generation of Americans has made,"" he said in another tweet.  Each year, Memorial Day offers us a chance to reflect on the enormity of the sacrifices that generation after generation of Americans has made. pic.twitter.com/yARTptfyO2 Biden also honored America’s war dead at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day, laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and giving an address about the sacrifices of fallen service members. He was joined by Harris, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff. ""We’re gathered at this sacred place in this solemn hour to engage in the most fundamental of undertakings: the rite of remembrance,"" Biden said. ""We remember those who gave their all in the service of America, in the service of freedom, in the service of justice. We remember their sacrifice, their valor, and their grace. We remember their smiles; their loves; their laughter; their essential, vibrant, and transcendent humanity."" Facebook posts claim that Biden and Harris didn’t say ""one word"" about American troops, veterans, or fallen military members for Memorial Day.  This is inaccurate. Biden and Harris each posted a tweet on May 29 about the holiday weekend without mentioning service members. But they made other statements during the weekend honoring military members and their families. Biden spoke at a Memorial Day event in Delaware, and he and Harris participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery.

No, ATF nominee Chipman was not part of 1993 siege in Waco, Texas
","After President Joe Biden nominated gun control advocate David Chipman to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Chipman found himself linked to the bloody 1993 government siege in Waco, Texas, that left 76 civilians and five federal agents dead. Chipman, who spent two decades at the ATF, became a policy adviser to two national gun control groups, Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Giffords: Courage to Fight Gun Violence. The gun industry and gun rights supporters firmly oppose his nomination.  Days after Biden announced Chipman as his pick, the London tabloid Daily Mail posted a photograph of a man in camouflage pants, holding an assault rifle, standing in the middle of the smoking wreckage of Waco. The caption read: ""Pictured is a young Chipman, who worked as an ATF agent for 25 years, posing in the aftermath of the Waco siege where 76 Branch Davidian members and five ATF agents died.""  The internet is rife with repetitions of the claim, and Chipman has received a torrent of death threats. But the evidence shows that he is not the man in the photo. Justice Department records indicate the photo is of an FBI agent and was taken on April 19, 1993. Chipman’s travel orders show that he wasn’t sent to Waco until early May, and he was not in the FBI. The Branch Davidians were a religious cult that stockpiled weapons and lived in a walled compound in Waco. In February 1993, an ATF raid to seize illegal weapons led to a shootout, followed by a protracted siege as federal and state agents, led by the FBI, encircled the property.  On the morning of April 19, 1993, federal forces advanced. A fire erupted inside the compound. Most of the men, women and children inside died. The events in Waco became a symbol of government oppression — a symbol so powerful, it inspired the revenge bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City two years later on April 19, 1995, that killed 168 people, including 19 children. On the day of Chipman’s confirmation hearing, a Republican politician in Maine tweeted the photo saying, ""We all remember Chipman’s time in Central Texas."" Let us be clear: It wasn’t him in that picture. Chipman said so at his May 26 confirmation hearing.  He was sent to Waco, he said, but as part of an ATF investigation team, two weeks after the fire. ""I was selected, because I had no involvement in the actual case that was being examined,"" Chipman said. The paper trail backs Chipman up. The picture circulating on the Internet bears the label USAWDTX 093-01048. That first part of that label tracks the photo back to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas.  After the siege, two court cases followed. The first was a criminal trial against surviving members of the Branch Davidians. The second, seven years later, was a civil suit on behalf of the Branch Davidians against the federal government. The Justice Department shared the photo, along with many others, as part of both proceedings. Former Dallas Morning News reporter Lee Hancock covered the entire Waco story for over a decade. She found a read-only CD in her files marked with the Justice Department’s seal and the words ""90 photos of HRT During Waco standoff through 4/19/1993.""  A Justice Department CD with photos from the Waco siege. (Lee Hancock) It is one of the Justice Department’s archives of photos from the siege, produced for the 2000 civil lawsuit. ""HRT is the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team,"" Hancock told PolitiFact. ""They were a tactical unit on the scene, some of them as negotiators, and some as sharpshooters, all the way through."" The photo in question is stored on that disk.    The file index on the Justice Department CD of Waco photos. (Lee Hancock)    The photo of an FBI agent on the Justice Department CD of Waco photos. (Lee Hancock) The label differs from the one on the photo posted by the Daily Mail because it was for the second trial, not the first. But otherwise, it’s the same photo. The man in the picture, whom we weren’t able to identify, was with the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team. Chipman was with the ATF, so he can’t be the one in the photo. In 2012, one of the leading critics of the FBI action, independent investigator and documentary maker Mike McNulty, described this and two other photos taken in the same spot at the same time as, ""The spirit of the FBI HRT during the Waco experience can be seen in the following pictures of three of the ‘Snipers’ posing in these ‘trophy’ shots."" One of the men in the other photos is wearing an FBI armband. One final detail: From the date printed on the Justice Department CD, along with the smoke rising from the ruins, the photo can be dated to April 19, 1993. On that day, Chipman, who was stationed at the ATF field office in Norfolk, Va., received a fax from the ATF associate director directing him and four other ATF agents to get to Waco by May 2.    1993 fax with the travel orders for David Chipman to report to Waco, Texas, by May 2, 1993. (David Chipman) Gun rights activists were quick to follow the Daily Mail’s lead in wrongly tying Chipman to Waco. Will Fite, a regional director with the National Association of Gun Rights tweeted the photo April 8, saying ""This is the man who Joe Biden just nominated to lead the ATF standing on the rubble and ashes of the Americans the ATF burned alive in Waco."" Larry Keane, the chief lobbyist for National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade group, repeated the Daily Mail’s claim in a GunGuyTV post, and reminded readers that the dead at Waco ""were Americans, some innocent children."" A pro-Trump forum Patriots Win posted the photo. One comment said, ""Mass murderer. American Nazi."" Multiple tweets, blog posts and articles assert that Chipman is the man in the photo of a government agent standing in the rubble of the Waco siege. Government filings prove that the photo dates from April 19, 1993, and that the man was a member of the FBI Hostage Rescue Team.  Chipman was in Norfolk, Va., on April 19, 1993, and served with the ATF, not the FBI.

"['New York', 'Andrew Giuliani']","
Claim from Giuliani on Covid-19 spread ‘wrong on every level’
","Andrew Giuliani, a former Trump White House aide, said on the day he announced that he is running for governor in New York that he hasn’t been vaccinated for COVID-19. 

Giuliani said he contracted the virus last year, and added he still gets tested for Covid-19 antibodies, which offer some protection from becoming reinfected.   ""The one good thing about the antibodies if you’ve had it, is it actually is even better than the vaccine, and here’s why. With the vaccine you can still transmit, with the antibodies you can’t transmit,""  Giuliani said at a news conference. ""So I can’t receive, and I can’t transmit. Obviously as that goes along, that reduction comes up, so there’s a certain amount of antibodies. I continue to get monitored every month on that.""   The views of the 35-year-old son of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani figure to become more widespread as he campaigns for New York State government’s most powerful job. So are his remarks about Covid-19 antibodies and the vaccine correct?  A spokesperson for the Giuliani campaign, Heather McBride, referred us to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for data regarding the effectiveness of post-Covid-19 antibodies.  The CDC did not respond to our messages, but the agency published a brief on April 2, in which it said that fully vaccinated people are less likely to have asymptomatic infection and less likely to spread the coronavirus to others, though investigation into this is ongoing.  Vaccine studies show that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are effective by 90 percent or more, and the Janssen vaccine is 67 percent effective, according to the CDC and the FDA.  In Israel, preliminary data suggests that people who received the Pfizer vaccine and then were infected with the virus have a four-fold lower viral load that people who hadn’t been vaccinated. According to the CDC, this could mean reduced transmission, ""as viral load has been identified as a key driver of transmission.""  A Covid-19 infection provides 83% protection against re-infection for at least five months, but it may not stop transmission, according to a study in England of thousands of health care workers who had been infected.  ""The research team warned, however, that early evidence from the next stage of the study suggested that some people who are themselves protected by antibodies still carry high levels of virus and could continue to infect others,"" according to a description of the study in BMJ, which publishes medical journals.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said in a White House briefing  in early May that the vaccine can protect people against the virus better than natural antibodies. ""Vaccines are highly efficacious,"" Fauci said. ""They are better than the traditional response you get from natural infection."" Dr. George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at University of California, San Francisco, said that immunity from the vaccine is much more robust, and it has more neutralizing antibodies than those found in people who have had the infection. People can also get infected with the virus that causes Covid-19 a second time, he said.  People who have Covid-19 can transmit the virus. But there is no ""shedding"" of the virus from the vaccine, because there’s no live virus in the vaccine, he said. In rare instances of ""vaccine failure,"" where people who are fully vaccinated get the virus, the virus can be transmitted. ""It’s completely wrong on every level,"" Rutherford said of Giuliani’s claim. 
  PolitiFact looked at what people who have been infected with the virus should do to protect themselves and others and found that cases of reinfection are rare. While those infected can continue shedding the virus for months after they recover, the CDC said, the amount is low enough that it is unlikely to infect others. But experts said that it’s unknown how long immunity lasts.  USA Today fact-checked a claim that people who have been vaccinated can shed virus particles from the vaccine on to others, and found that it was false. The three vaccines authorized for emergency use do not contain live virus. In the rare instances where vaccinated people are infected with the virus, they can transmit the virus, according to the CDC.   Giuliani claimed that having antibodies from Covid-19 infection is better than the vaccine because people with antibodies cannot transmit the virus, but people who are vaccinated can. Scientists say more study of the virus and the vaccines is necessary, but nothing in the research supports Guiliani’s claim. The CDC warns that people who have had the virus and people who have been vaccinated can still get Covid-19, and both can transmit the virus. For people who have already had the virus, the level of transmission is unknown. For people who are vaccinated, research shows their viral load is lower, reducing transmission. Based on the data available at the time he made his statement, we rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jun/01/andrew-giuliani/giuliani-claim-about-covid-19-transmission-not-bac/
"['North Carolina', 'Privacy Issues', 'Natasha Marcus']","
What North Carolina's donor privacy bill would, and wouldn't, do for nonprofits
","A new bill aims to offer more protection to North Carolinians who donate to nonprofits. Senate Bill 636, known as the donor privacy bill, recently passed the state Senate along partisan lines with Democrats claiming the bill would make so-called dark money ""even darker.""  However, conservatives claimed that some Senators went too far with their criticisms. ""This bill would allow politically active 501(c)(4) organizations to hide major donors while using their money to support or oppose candidates and political issues,"" tweeted state Sen. Natasha Marcus, a Democrat. ""In short, the bill says that non-profits can now conceal who their donors are,"" state Sen. Jeff Jackson tweeted as part of a thread. The tweet by Marcus is more specific. So PolitiFact wondered: What, exactly, would the bill do? And would it change access to 501(c)(4) donor lists? It’s fair to say the bill would make dark money darker. Bill supporters have said it’s their intent to provide nonprofit donors more protection. However, it’s wrong for Marcus to suggest that the bill itself would move 501(c)(4) donor lists out of the public eye or outside the reach of the government. These lists are mostly concealed from the public already. And the bill specifically says its new rules would ""not apply to disclosures required by State or federal law, criminal investigations, or orders of the court."" As WRAL reported, it comes as part of a wave of bills being filed in states across the country that seek to protect donor privacy against what Republicans see as ""cancel culture,"" or being publicly criticized for giving to causes that may not be popular with some.  Experts who spoke with PolitiFact NC hypothesized that the move might be preemptive in nature.  It comes as the U.S. Supreme Court considers a case where a nonprofit is challenging California’s law requiring the disclosure of nonprofit donors. Meanwhile in Congress, pending legislation seeks to increase transparency about campaign donors. Summaries of the SB 636 have been published by nonpartisan legislative staff, as well as the University of North Carolina School of Law’s Legislative Reporting Service. Most notably, the bill says: Lists of nonprofit donor names can’t be released publicly ""for any purpose unrelated to a member's interest as a member"" without consent of the nonprofit’s board of directors.  A nonprofit donor’s identity must remain private ""if the person has notified the nonprofit corporation, in writing prior to or at the time of the donation, not to disclose the (donor's) identity."" Government officials who abuse their access to nonprofit donor lists could be subject to a Class 1 misdemeanor (punishable by up to 120 days in jail).  It should be noted that the bill has been amended multiple times. The most recent version of the bill puts the onus on donors to say they want their privacy protected. In other words, ""It really is just saying that the nonprofits can't voluntarily disclose their donors if the donors have asked to remain confidential,"" Brain Hauss, a staff attorney with the ACLU Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. ""If the donor, you know, in providing their donation to the nonprofit, says ‘I want to keep my name confidential.’ Now under this bill that nonprofit would be legally obligated to keep it confidential with whatever penalties are applied in the bill,"" Hauss said. There are several different types of nonprofits, with some having more freedom in the political arena than others. The Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) offers a helpful summary on its website.  501(c)(3) nonprofits, such as the NAACP or the Heritage Foundation, tend to operate for religious, charitable or educational purposes and aren’t supposed to engage in any political activities. They’re also tax-exempt. 501(c)(4) nonprofits -- the type Marcus singled out -- are considered ""social welfare"" groups and are allowed to engage in some political activities. Examples included the NRA and Planned Parenthood. When it comes to disclosing donors to the government, the IRS has different rules for different types of nonprofits. 501(c)(3) nonprofits are required to disclose the names of people who donate $5,000 or more, while 501(c)(4)s are not.  A California law firm, Nossaman LLP has a helpful chart on its website.  Would SB 636 change any of these disclosure requirements? No. ""Nothing in S.636 would affect these disclosures. Nonprofits would still provide Schedule B to the IRS but not to the public,"" David Heinen, a Vice President for the North Carolina Center for Nonprofits. North Carolina’s bill, 636, specifically says it doesn’t affect what forms are provided to the state and federal governments. ""This subsection (about nonprofit donor identities) shall not apply to disclosures required by State or federal law, criminal investigations, or orders of the court,"" the bill reads, with emphasis added by PolitiFact. Analysis by legislative staff also said the privacy rules apply ""except as specifically required by State or federal law."" Marcus specifically cited 501(c)(4)s in her tweet, and her phrasing could give the impression that the bill would change the public’s access to the identities of 501(c)(4) donors. In reality, most donor lists are already concealed. Experts told PolitiFact the bill would mostly affect nonprofits who release the identities voluntarily. This issue can be confusing. So let’s review the facts in a question-and-answer format. If a private citizen wants to see who donates to a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, can they do that now? Probably not.  Experts told PolitiFact that 501(c)(4) donor identities aren't public unless a nonprofit discloses them, either voluntarily or by accident. (A spokesman for the IRS referred us to Page 5 of a Schedule B form.) Not only are they not available to the public, the Trump administration in 2018 reduced what some nonprofits were required to report to the IRS. This applied to 501(c)(4)s as well. ""Previously, these (donor lists) would be reported to the IRS in the Schedule B (form) then redacted before the Form 990 was made available to the public,"" said Anna Massoglia, an editor and researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics. ""Organizations are still supposed to keep donor names and addresses in their own records in case they are requested as part of a court order or IRS examination,"" she said. As for North Carolina, the Tar Heel state doesn’t require the disclosure of donors for public non-profits either, said Schorr Johnson, spokesperson for the Department of Revenue.  ""The NC Department of Revenue does not have any form or requirement for the disclosure of donors to nonprofits similar to the IRS 990 form. The NCDOR does not receive information from those IRS forms and if we did, it would be treated as protected taxpayer information under the existing taxpayer secrecy statute,"" Johnson said. Massoglia says some donor identities may occasionally appear on the North Carolina Secretary of State website. However, that’s only if a nonprofit has voluntarily disclosed the names. And ""instances like that are rare."" The Secretary of State’s office told us the bill ""would not stop any non-profit information that we receive now,"" spokeswoman Liz Proctor said. Heinen, of the NC Center for Nonprofits, agreed that the bill wouldn’t change what information is required to be made available to the public. So did Hauss, the ACLU lawyer, and Abby Levine, director of Alliance for Justice’s Bolder Advocacy Program ""To me, it seems like this doesn't really change much,"" Levine said. ""They're just being very clear about wanting to come out front and say, ‘We will not require disclosure of this information."" Pat Ryan, a spokesman for Republican state Senate leader Phil Berger, says someone ""could make a case that the bill isn’t technically necessary, but there’s enough grey area"" that Republicans feel legislation may be needed. ""A hypothetical would be if the NC Department of Justice were investigating, say, Planned Parenthood for some reason, and as part of that investigation they obtained Planned Parenthood’s donor list,"" Ryan said. ""Some people really do not like Planned Parenthood and may use a published donor list to harass or intimidate their private donors,"" he said, adding: ""If this bill were law, it would make it explicit that the Planned Parenthood’s donor list is private, and DOJ can’t just put it on a website somewhere."" Does the bill hide campaign finance information that is currently public? No. Marcus mentioned that 501(c)(4) organizations can use their money in political ways, which is true. These nonprofits are often referred to as ""dark money"" groups because, while they might spend money on political ads or events, they are not required to publicly disclose the identity of their donors.  But it’s misleading to say the bill would ""allow"" 501(c)(4)s to hide their donors while operating that way. The bill summary prepared by legislative staff says ""confidential treatment of donors to nonprofits does not apply to required campaign finance disclosures, including electioneering communications."" (Emphasis added by PolitiFact.) And the North Carolina State Elections Board doesn’t see anything that would change campaign finance disclosures, spokesman Patrick Gannon told PolitiFact. We reached out to Marcus about her tweet and received a lengthy email response. She said while SB 636 ""will not necessarily create new loopholes, it would make existing loopholes more problematic.""  Marcus speculated that the bill could ""make it even harder"" for state agencies, such as the elections board, to investigate 501(c)(4)s for campaign spending violations. ""Under the current law, a whistleblower could prompt an investigation by the State Board of Elections, and the board could demand this donor information,"" her email says. ""If this bill passes, the nonprofits could argue that they do not have to disclose their donors, and perhaps are forbidden from doing so, based on the intent of the law and the donor’s expectation of privacy."" The bill specifically says the changes don’t apply to disclosures required by law, criminal investigations, or orders of the court. We also asked the state elections board whether they believe the bill would make investigations more difficult, and they said no. ""We do not believe so,"" Gannon said. ""The Chair still has subpoena power under G.S. 163-23. We do not see anything in the bill that would impact that authority. Books, records and other evidence collected in the course of a campaign finance investigation are already confidential pursuant to G.S. 163-278.22(7)."" Marcus added that, outside the campaign finance context, the bill could make it easier for government officials to solicit contributions to their favored 501(c)(4) in exchange for certain government actions, ""but the prohibition on disclosing donor information would make it even harder for anyone to learn of the transactions."" Marcus noted that the bill isn’t being pushed by the NC Center for Nonprofits, which supports 501(c)(3)s. That’s true, it’s neither supported or opposed by the NC Center for Nonprofits, Heinen said. In an email, Marcus also said it ""says a lot"" about this bill that it’s supported by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group. However, it’s also supported by the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina, ACLU-NC spokesman Dustin Chicurel-Bayard told PolitiFact. And in the U.S. Supreme Court case, opponents of California’s law include nonprofits from across the political spectrum, including the NAACP, the libertarian Cato Institute, and the conservative Institution for Justice. The ACLU believes releasing the names of nonprofit supporters could scare people away from donating to nonprofits, said Hauss, the ACLU attorney. He says the group sees a ""major distinction"" between disclosure to the government versus disclosure to the public.  ""In either scenario there's a threat of chill. If you're the NAACP in Alabama in the 50s, you know you're worried that disclosing even to the government can lead to all sorts of shenanigans. But in general, the idea is that if you disclose the government, the government does not have a history of retaliation,"" he said. ""Whereas if it's publicly disclosed either inadvertently or, or by law, the chilling effect goes way up. And in the age of social media, that’s especially true."" Marcus said the bill would ""allow politically active 501(c)(4) organizations to hide major donors while using their money to support or oppose candidates and political issues.""

COVID-19 vaccines do not create the virus' variants
","This is a new one. Instead of the established understanding that vaccines help reduce the spread of COVID-19, and thereby decrease the likelihood that the virus will be able to mutate enough to create new variants, a new claim circulating online posits that it’s the vaccines that are creating the variants. The claim comes from French virologist Luc Montagnier, a joint recipient of the Nobel Prize in 2008 for discovering HIV. But Montagnier has been in the news since for sharing what some scientists characterize as pseudoscientific statements, most recently relating to misinformation about the coronavirus. Montagnier makes the claim in a 2-minute video spreading on Facebook that’s spoken in French with English subtitles. It bears the watermark of the RAIR Foundation, which describes itself as a ""grassroots activist organization"" that’s working to ""combat the threats from Islamic supremacists, radical leftists and their allies."" In the video, Montagnier calls the vaccination program for COVID-19 ""an unacceptable mistake"" because, according to him, ""it is the vaccination that is creating the variants.""  He adds: ""For the China virus there are antibodies created by the vaccine. What does the virus do? Does it die or find another solution? The new variants are a production and result from the vaccination."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, it’s important to note that we found no evidence that this video is doctored. Bethan John, a French speaker and social media journalist for the misinformation research organization First Draft, wrote up an analysis of the video and says the clip of Montagnier was posted on alternative video sharing platform Odysee by HOLD-UP Média, a group behind a viral French documentary-style video about the pandemic that’s been debunked by fact-checkers.  John reported that the video’s misleading narrative that the vaccines create variants has been gaining traction in France for several weeks. Other First Draft researchers also found the video circulating in Spanish and Portugese and said the subtitles matched the claims Montagnier is seen making in the video, though there are a lot of sharp editing cuts throughout. But while the video appears legitimate, what Montagnier said in it is not. First, several of the variants that are circulating in the global population emerged before COVID-19 vaccines were widely available, like B.1.1.7, the variant that emerged in the United Kingdom in September 2020. Second, the vaccines help reduce the spread of the virus, therefore decreasing the likelihood that it will mutate and create new variants.  The video’s claim is a distortion of the factual premise that slow vaccine uptake in a population can lead to the development of variants.  Viruses try to create variants in order to escape immunity — but that’s any immunity — vaccine-induced or natural, which arises from being infected.  The difference is that people who are vaccinated are better protected against such variants.  ""The virus is always going to try to evolve to promote its own survival,"" said Dr. Sarah Fortune, chair of the Immunology and Infectious Diseases department at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""It doesn’t mean people shouldn’t get vaccinated. The virus is going to try to evolve to escape natural immunity, even if you choose not to get vaccinated."" She added: ""Either people are going to get sick and get COVID-19, and the virus tries to escape that immune selection, or people can be vaccinated and the virus is going to try to escape that immune selection. Avoiding vaccination is not going to limit the evolution of the virus."" In the video, Montagnier also discusses a phenomenon called ""antibody-dependent enhancement"" as a concern with the COVID-19 vaccines. That’s a phenomenon that happens when antibodies produced by an infection or a vaccine bind to the viral pathogen, but don’t kill it. Sometimes called ""ADE,"" it can cause people with antibodies to have more severe symptoms should they end up getting infected later.  But the video fails to mention that this has not been observed with COVID-19 or any of the vaccines that have been developed to prevent it. ADE was initially a concern contemplated by scientists when they were creating COVID-19 vaccines. Animal studies were designed to specifically look for signs of ADE, and did not find any evidence of it. There has also been no sign of it happening in the real world rollout of the vaccines. ""With lots and lots of experience with use of antibodies therapeutically, we’ve seen no evidence of enhancement,"" Dr. Stuart Ray, a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s medical school, told the Associated Press in a related fact-check. ""We also worried about the possibility that people who were reinfected might have more severe infection, akin to the situation we’ve seen with dengue virus, and that also hasn’t been borne out. So there’s really no basis for the claim that’s being ascribed to Dr. Montagnier."" Shortly after winning the Nobel Prize, Montagnier started to make headlines when he claimed that a ""good immune system"" was enough to protect people against AIDS. He has also become known for being anti-vaccination and pro-homeopathy and believes that ""water has memory,"" a theory that has been discredited by the scientific community. In 2017, in response to Montagnier’s claims that vaccines are poisonous, over 100 academic scientists wrote an open letter that said, ""We, academics of medicine, cannot accept that one of our peers is using his Nobel Prize [status] to spread dangerous health messages outside of his field of knowledge,"" according to the French news website Connexion. A video on Facebook shows French virologist Luc Montagnier claiming that the COVID-19 vaccines create the variants. The COVID-19 vaccines help reduce the spread of the virus, decreasing the likelihood that it will mutate and create new variants. Several coronavirus variants emerged before the vaccines were rolled out in late 2020. Slow vaccine uptake can cause more variants, since the virus continually looks to evolve and escape any immunity — natural or vaccine-induced. Public health experts say this doesn’t mean that people shouldn’t get vaccinated, but just the opposite, as faster uptake slows this from happening and will leave people better protected from the virus in the process. We rate this False.

Instagram post misleads on vaccine efficacy by conflating two different measures
","A widespread Instagram post argues, wrongly, that new information has shown the COVID-19 vaccines to be far less effective than advertised. The post errs by conflating two different calculations used to gauge the efficacy of vaccines, and it makes false conclusions based on that error.  ""The Lancet peer-reviewed study confirms vaccine efficacy, not as 95% stated by the vaccine companies, but as: AstraZeneca 1.3%; Moderna 1.2%; J&J 1.2%; Pfizer 0.84%,"" says the May 26 Instagram post, which received thousands of likes. ""They deceived everyone by reporting Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) rather than Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)."" ""Your Pheyezur schmaccine just went from 95% down to 0.84% effective,"" the Instagram post adds, in a reference to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine’s 95% efficacy in clinical trials. The post and others like it were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Misspelling vaccine terms is a common tactic used on social media to evade the tools used by fact-checkers. The article cited in the post is a Lancet Microbe commentary, not a peer-reviewed study. And one of its authors, along with other experts, said the post’s interpretation is misleading. ""It is extremely disappointing to see how information can be twisted,"" said Piero Olliaro, a professor of poverty related infectious diseases at the University of Oxford’s Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health. ""We do not say vaccines do not work.""  A screenshot of a May 26, 2021, Instagram post wrongly claiming the COVID-19 vaccines are less effective than advertised. The person behind the Instagram post did not respond to requests for comment. The COVID-19 vaccines available for use in the U.S. are highly effective. Pfizer’s two-dose vaccine, for example, was found in clinical trials to be 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 infection, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The Instagram post says that based on new information, the vaccine ""went from 95% down to 0.84% effective."" But that’s not the case. The post mixes up two different measures of vaccine efficacy that can be calculated from the clinical trial data. Both measures are expressed as percentages, but they describe different things. Broadly speaking, one describes the probability of avoiding infection by getting vaccinated. The other represents the proportion of people in a group who avoided infection as a result of getting vaccinated, given their baseline risks. The commentary highlighted this second measure. When we hear that the Pfizer vaccine has 95% efficacy, that doesn’t mean 5% of recipients will get COVID-19. Instead, it means that the people who received the vaccine in clinical trials had a 95% lower chance of becoming infected than those who received a placebo.  This vaccine efficacy figure is what epidemiologists refer to as the relative risk reduction.  This is the measure that’s commonly reported for vaccines, including the yearly flu shot, said Natalie Dean, assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida. It’s the ""most immediately meaningful"" indicator of efficacy because it’s easily generalizable. Imagine that ""one version of you is vaccinated and one version of you is unvaccinated,"" Dean said. For a vaccine with 95% efficacy as measured by relative risk reduction, ""the vaccinated version of you has a 95% lower risk, lower chance of getting sick."" The other measure is known as absolute risk reduction. This measure accounts for people’s baseline risks of getting COVID-19. It changes across different groups and timeframes, depending on how likely a certain population is to get COVID-19 in the first place, without protection from the vaccine.  Richard Watanabe, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, defined absolute risk reduction as ""the proportion of people in the population who do not develop disease"" as a result of getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Put differently, it’s the number of percentage points a population’s risk goes down by taking the vaccine. ""You can imagine that different people will have different baseline levels of risk, depending on where they live, what their occupation is, all different things,"" Dean said. ""The people who had a larger risk at baseline will have a larger benefit (from the vaccine) in those absolute terms."" Both efficacy figures can be drawn from the clinical trial data, by comparing the percentage of vaccinated participants who got COVID-19 with the percentage of unvaccinated participants who got COVID-19. The relative risk reduction is calculated using a ratio that divides one percentage by the other, while the absolute risk reduction takes the arithmetic difference between the two. (The mathematical formulas are listed in a table with the Lancet commentary.) The numbers that appeared in the Instagram post come from the Lancet commentary and were calculated by Olliaro’s team. But they’re ""on a totally different scale"" than the 95% and other vaccine efficacy numbers that were widely reported, Dean said.  The absolute risk reduction ""looks much smaller than the relative effect,"" said Matthew Fox, a professor of epidemiology at Boston University. ""But remember, over the time the vaccine trials are run, only a percentage of those in the study were exposed to COVID, so most people would not be infected even if not vaccinated. So a 1%-2% absolute reduction is a big reduction, and could result in dramatically fewer infections when we vaccinate the population."" On its own, the absolute risk reduction can be hard to understand, Olliaro said. But the figure can help with policymaking, because it can be used to estimate how many people need to be vaccinated in a given population in order to prevent one additional case of COVID-19. The post’s claim that the COVID-19 vaccine developers ""deceived everyone"" wrongly suggests that a cover-up was in effect to make the shots seem more efficacious than they are.  ""The drug companies are not trying to hide anything,"" Watanabe said. ""If you were a competent scientist you could, like the authors of the Lancet article, calculate the other metrics by hand using the data reported in the original New England Journal of Medicine papers."" Second, the post falsely claims that the Lancet commentary proved the reported vaccine efficacy figures — such as Pfizer’s 95% — were wrong. Those figures have since been backed by real-world studies, including one that found the Pfizer shot to be 90% effective. Olliaro, who co-wrote the Lancet commentary, said it’s wrong to interpret the commentary — which has led to some back-and-forth among scholars — as saying the vaccines don’t work. The commentary argued that vaccine developers should more prominently report absolute risk reductions alongside relative risk reductions in order to facilitate public health decisions and compare vaccines, Olliaro said.  But the ""bottom line,"" Olliaro said, is that ""these vaccines are good public health interventions."" An Instagram post says, ""The Lancet peer-reviewed study confirms vaccine efficacy, not as 95% stated by the vaccine companies, but as: AstraZeneca 1.3%; Moderna 1.2%; J&J 1.2%; Pfizer 0.84%."" The post says the vaccine developers ""deceived everyone."" The Lancet Microbe article cited as evidence was a commentary, not a peer-reviewed study. And the commentary did not say that the COVID-19 vaccines don’t work, or that the widely reported vaccine efficacy numbers — such as Pfizer’s 95% efficacy — were inaccurate. The post errs by conflating two different efficacy measures to give the false impression that the vaccines are far less effective than advertised, and that the vaccine developers gave inaccurate numbers to the public.  We rate this Instagram post Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/may/28/instagram-posts/instagram-post-misleads-vaccine-efficacy-conflatin/
