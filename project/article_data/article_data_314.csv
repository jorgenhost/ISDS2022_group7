Trump backers paid nearly all the $6 million cost of Ariz. ballot review
","A widely shared Instagram post wrongly claims that taxpayers paid for a review of ballots from the 2020 presidential election in Arizona’s largest county. The review was sought by Donald Trump and his supporters and ordered by Republicans in the state Senate. The final report issued Sept. 24 confirmed that Trump lost to Joe Biden in Maricopa County, actually by a larger margin than the county’s official canvass counted. ""This sham recount cost the tax payers $6 million,"" the post stated. ""That's right, WE paid our own hard earned dollars for Trump to have his bull---- recount, which proved he actually lost by more votes than we even originally thought."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the Republicans have referred to the review as an ""audit,"" election experts say that it did not follow typical post-election auditing procedures and lacked credibility. The review found that Biden had 45,469 more votes than Trump in Maricopa, roughly in line with the official results certified in November 2020. According to the report issued by Cyber Ninjas, the firm hired to conduct the review, Biden’s margin of victory was 360 votes larger than the county’s official canvass showed. The margin helped Biden beat Trump in Arizona by about 10,500 votes, the first time a Democratic presidential nominee had won there since 1996. News stories have been clear that Trump supporters by and large picked up the tab. Groups tied to the ""stop the steal"" movement and other efforts to cast doubt on the 2020 results raised nearly all of the $6 million to fund the inquiry, Reuters reported. The Arizona Mirror reported on the five pro-Trump nonprofits that raised the nearly $5.7 million. Arizona’s Senate agreed to spend $150,000 on the review, plus security and facility costs, which ""pales in comparison to the nearly $5.7 million contributed as of late July by Trump allies,"" the Associated Press reported.  However, Maricopa County decided to spend nearly $3 million for new vote-counting machines, saying the old machines were compromised in the review because they were in the control of firms not accredited to handle election equipment, AP reported. An Instagram post said Arizona’s ballot review cost taxpayers $6 million. Trump supporters, not taxpayers, paid the bulk of the nearly $6 million it cost to review ballots in Maricopa County.  Taxpayers contributed $150,000 toward the review, plus $3 million for new vote-counting machines to replace machines that the county decided had been compromised during the review.

National Archives 'warning label' claim on target but misses key point
","The National Archives is a repository for millions of documents chronicling the United States, from the creation of the federal government to rules, laws and more. In addition to the physical copies of the documents, such as the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, the Archives provide access to much of its collection online. That access comes with … a warning label? That’s what U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wisconsin, claimed in a Sept. 22, 2021 tweet: ""The @USNatArchives thought it would be a good idea to put a ‘harmful content’ warning on our nation’s Founding documents,"" he wrote, adding: ""This label is an attack on our history and undermines documents written to preserve individual liberties and fundamental rights.""  For the purpose of our check, we’re going to focus on the first part of the tweet. Did the National Archives place ""harmful content"" warnings on some of the nation’s founding documents? And, as the tweet suggests, were those documents specifically targeted?
  Grothman’s tweet was actually a retweet of another Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Babin of Texas.  Babin’s tweet included a link to an article published that day by the Daily Caller, a conservative leaning online publication, about how some Republicans were calling for the so-called ""trigger warnings"" on the documents to be removed.  When asked for backup for the claim Grothman’s office sent links to the Constitution, Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights on the National Archives website. On each of those documents, there is indeed a ""Harmful Language Alert.""  In an online statement, the Archives -- formally, the National Archives and Records Administration, or NARA -- notes it provides public access to millions of records, adding:  ""The Catalog and web pages contain some content that may be harmful or difficult to view. NARA’s records span the history of the United States, and it is our charge to preserve and make available these historical records. As a result, some of the materials presented here may reflect outdated, biased, offensive, and possibly violent views and opinions. In addition, some of the materials may relate to violent or graphic events and are preserved for their historical significance."" The Archives are even more specific in a Q&A about the labels, noting some of the documents may:  Reflect racist, sexist, ableist, misogynistic/misogynoir and xenophobic opinions and attitudes Be discriminatory towards or exclude diverse views on sexuality, gender, religion and more Include graphic content of historical events such as violent death, medical procedures, crime, wars/terrorist acts, natural disasters and more Demonstrate bias and exclusion in institutional collecting and digitization policies. So, Grothman is generally on target, but here’s a key point he missed: The Archives includes the warning on all documents across its collection of records of the U.S. federal government. In other words, the founding documents were not singled out, as Grothman’s tweet suggests. The warning is general and automatically appears on every page of the online catalog, according to the National Archives communication staff. It’s also important to note that none of the documents are altered or censored in any way.  Grothman claimed in a tweet that there were ""harmful content"" warnings added to the founding documents, such as the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, on the National Archives website. That may surprise readers and historians alike. He’s right that there are warnings on the founding documents, but the warnings appear on every page within the National Archives’ online database. They don’t single out the founding documents. Our definition for Half True is ""the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097020940>],/factchecks/2021/sep/30/glenn-grothman/grothman-right-claim-harmful-content-warnings-plac/

Biden infrastructure plan wouldn’t establish a per-mile driving tax
","A viral image popular on Facebook claims that the $1 trillion infrastructure bill moving through Washington would establish a per-mile ""driving tax."" The image takes the form of a screenshot of a TV graphic from Newsmax purportedly detailing ""Biden tax increases.""  ""Per-mile user fee. Estimated to be 8 cents per mile,"" reads text on the slide.  ""This will be in addition to the already in place fuel tax,"" one user wrote in the caption of their post.   The image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

One provision buried in the 2,700-page infrastructure bill supported by President Joe Biden does create a pilot program to study the effects of a per-mile tax. However, it’s misleading to equate the pilot program with an actual fee. ""The claim is a ridiculous distortion,"" said Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank.  The purpose of the pilot program would be to test whether a mileage fee would be a viable way to support the Highway Trust Fund in lieu of the current gasoline tax. The fee has long been discussed as a means of replacing the gas tax as the auto industry moves toward electric cars, Michele Nellenbach, vice president of strategic initiatives at the Bipartisan Policy Center, previously told PolitiFact. Some states have tried their own pilot programs. Participants would record the miles they drive in passenger and commercial vehicles and pay fees based on those miles. Enrollment would be voluntary, and all participants would be fully reimbursed for any charges they pay. ""It is difficult to know how many people will participate, but I would expect in the tens or hundreds of thousands,"" said Mariya Frost, the director of the Coles Center for Transportation at the Washington Policy Center, a center-right think tank.  If passed, the program would last from fiscal year 2022 to 2026. Each year, a report would be submitted to House and Senate committees concerning the program’s success at generating revenue and keeping user information private, among other subjects.  Enacting any federal per-mile driving fee would require separate legislative action, said Susan Howard, program director for transportation finance and director at the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.  ""Implementation of any per-mile tax is likely still years away,"" she said.  A Facebook post claimed that the Biden infrastructure bill contains a provision establishing a per-mile driving tax.  This is inaccurate. The infrastructure bill would create a pilot program that would study the effect and viability of a per-mile driving tax among a group of volunteers. Enrollment in the pilot program would be voluntary, and participants would be fully reimbursed for any fees they pay.  We rate this claim False. ​",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F9CC80>],/factchecks/2021/sep/29/facebook-posts/biden-infrastructure-plan-wouldnt-establish-mile-d/

Post overstates number of missing kids in flawed comparison to Gabby Petito case
","As the public took an outsize interest in the missing person case of Gabby Petito, a viral image suggested that not enough attention is being paid to the many children who go missing each year. The image depicts a streetlight shining on the words ""Gabby Petito case,"" while the words "".5 million missing kids a year"" are in darkness. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The image overstates the number of reports of missing children in the United States each year by about 20%. And the number of active missing-child cases is far lower. Petito, a 22-year-old white woman, was on a cross-country camping trip with her fiancé, Brian Laundrie. On Sept. 1, Laundrie returned to his parents’ home without Petito. Petito was reported missing on Sept. 11. On Sept. 17, authorities began a search for Laundrie after his parents told them they hadn’t seen him in three days. On Sept. 21, authorities announced that human remains found two days earlier in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming were those of Petito, and that the cause of death was homicide.  The FBI obtained an arrest warrant for Laundrie the next day, on a charge of unauthorized use of a debit card after Petito’s death, and are still searching for him. The media attention to the case triggered criticisms that missing-person cases involving non-white women in the West were not being covered as widely. The viral image about missing children follows in a similar vein, but it gets the numbers wrong.  In 2020, 543,018 missing persons cases were entered into the FBI’s National Crime Information Center system.  Of those, 365,348 were age 17 or under, down from 421,394 in 2019.  The counts include children who were reported missing to law enforcement more than one time. The number of active cases is much smaller.  The nonprofit National Center for Missing & Exploited Children said it assisted law enforcement, families and child welfare agencies with 29,782 cases of missing children in 2020.  Of those, 27,072 were runaways, the vast majority of whom are located quickly, said the center’s Rebecca Steinbach. The next-largest category was family abduction, 1,396 cases. A viral image that invoked the Gabby Petito case claimed there are 500,000 ""missing kids a year."" In 2020, there were 365,348 reports of missing children made to law enforcement agencies that were recorded by the FBI’s National Crime Information Center.

Posts stating Arizona ‘could decertify’ 2020 presidential election are Pants on Fire
","Some supporters of a GOP-led review of ballots cast in the 2020 presidential election in Arizona’s Maricopa County have engaged in wishful thinking that the process would lead to decertification of the election results. The idea is nothing but a fantasy. ""Arizona bombshell dropped — could decertify,"" said a Facebook post on Sept. 24, the day that the full report about the ballot review was released. The post linked to a clip of Steve Bannon, a former adviser to former President Donald Trump, interviewing Boris Epshteyn, an adviser to Trump’s 2020 campaign. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Arizona state Senate Republicans ordered a review of 2 million ballots in Maricopa, the state’s largest county and home to Phoenix, the capital. The review found that Joe Biden beat Trump in Maricopa by about 45,000 votes. That number was virtually the same as the county’s official canvass. Arizona state officials certified the results on Nov. 30 showing that Joe Biden won Arizona by about 10,500 votes. As Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said on Twitter, the results stand: The election is over. ""There will be no decertification of the 2020 election —  the audit does not call for one, and even if it had, there is no lawful way to decertify. As we have every step of the way, Arizona will follow the law,"" Ducey tweeted. That’s true for all states once the Electoral College has cast its votes. Once the electors vote, as they did on Dec. 14, 2020, ""there is no constitutional mechanism to undo the popular vote that led to the appointment of the electors,"" said Ohio State University law professor Edward Foley. And federal law clearly does not give states a right to withdraw or change a certification once a president has been sworn into office, said Paul Bender, Arizona State University law professor. A Facebook post stated that Arizona ""could decertify"" the 2020 presidential election. State officials certified the results of the election on Nov. 30 according to the law. Those results showed that Biden won the election. The 2020 presidential election in Arizona was settled months ago, and the GOP-led review of ballots in Maricopa County doesn’t change that fact or call for any decertification.

Republican PAC ad distorts Democratic plans to tax jumbo-sized retirement accounts
","Republicans are trying to put vulnerable 2022 House Democrats in a tough spot over a $3 trillion spending package that would include  day care, paid family leave, climate change fixes and other Democratic priorities but also new fees and taxes to help offset the costs.  The Republican-aligned PAC, the Common Sense Leadership Fund, is spending $10 million on ads targeting Democrats in Michigan, Iowa, New York, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Utah and Nebraska. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., faces this attack ad running in his district: ""For decades, Americans played by the rules with the promise they could invest in a secure retirement without penalty. But now Washington liberals want to tax your retirement funds to pay for their new trillion dollar power grab. They call it progress, but it's theft, pure and simple. Call Dan Kildee. Tell him America stands by its promises. Don't let Washington liberals steal our retirement."" The ad unspools a series of close-ups of ordinary elderly people. Their faces are lined, their expressions somber. At the heart of the ad is the claim that Washington liberals — read Democrats — ""want to tax your retirement funds.""  What the ad omits is that this proposed tax change would apply only if you have more than $10 million in retirement funds.  The sprawling reconciliation bill called the Build Back Better Act has some new rules for people who have more than $10 million combined in their traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs and defined contribution plans such as 401(k)s. Decades ago, lawmakers crafted tax incentives to encourage people to save for retirement through individual retirement accounts. With a traditional IRA, the money goes in pretax, but gets taxed when it comes out. For a Roth IRA, the money gets taxed before it goes in, then — no matter how much the fund gains in value — withdrawals are tax-free. The Roth rules have produced some striking advantages for a few wealthy people who have been able to get around the income and annual contribution limits that apply to Roth IRAs. Investigative reporters with ProPublica, a nonprofit news organization, found that the co-founder of PayPal, Peter Thiel, had built a Roth IRA worth $5 billion, which he could withdraw tax-free. The House plan would make it more difficult for such huge sums to accumulate tax-free in Roth IRAs, barring additional contributions once a person hits the $10 million mark across their retirement savings accounts. The cap applies only to individuals making over $400,000 a year, or $450,000 for couples filing jointly. People with combined accounts worth over $10 million would have to start withdrawing money from their accounts, starting with their Roth accounts. These changes would affect about 3,600 taxpayers nationwide, the estimated number of people with combined balances over $10 million. That’s out of over 51 million people who currently have traditional or Roth IRAs. The Democratic proposal would also shut the door on people converting money in traditional IRAs into Roth IRAs, a strategy many people use to reduce their taxes. But again, that change would apply to individuals making over $400,000 a year, or couples earning $450,000. Those people make up a group that’s a bit larger than the top 1% of all taxpayers. According to IRS data, about 91,000 taxpayers in the top 1% of earners used the conversion option in 2018. Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that in the first four years, the new rules would raise about $8.9 billion from these taxpayers. But by the fifth year, as taxpayers adapted, the changes would produce modest tax cuts. The net revenue gain after 10 years would be $4.3 billion. Mark Iwry, a non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former senior Treasury official in charge of national retirement policy, said that while $4.3 billion is real money, it’s a small part of the multi-trillion dollar reconciliation package. ""While this would contribute a bit toward paying for the bill, it is mainly a policy statement,"" Iwry said. ""IRAs were designed to promote retirement security for most working households, not to shelter billionaire’s multi-billion dollar gains from taxes."" Contrary to the ad’s point that liberals want to ""steal"" from people’s retirement, other parts of the bill subsidize retirement savings by tens of millions of average income households. These proposals create a system of automatic enrollment in IRAs, and expand tax credits for lower and moderate income savers. These changes would cost the government about $47 billion over 10 years. These moves are not new ideas. Iwry co-authored these measures over 15 years ago. The savers tax credit has been on the books for a long time. We tried contacting the Common Sense Leadership Fund, but weren’t able to reach the director. The Common Sense Leadership Fund said that Democrats ""want to tax your retirement funds to pay for their new trillion dollar power grab.""  The ad implies that this refers broadly to people with retirement savings accounts. In fact, the Democratic plan it alludes to targets a thin sliver of very wealthy individuals: about 3,600 taxpayers, those with retirement accounts worth over $10 million. It creates no new tax, but exposes these people to existing tax rules through caps on the amount they can contribute to tax-advantaged savings accounts. The proposed ban on conversions from traditional to Roth IRAs would affect over 100,000 people, but that still applies only to roughly the top 1% of earners. The claim contains an element of truth about changes to tax laws on retirement savings but ignores important facts about who is affected.

‘Tree equity’ part of $3.5T bill targets low-income areas that have fewer trees
","One piece of the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill — $3 billion for trees — is being ridiculed in a widely shared Facebook post. The post states: ""The Democrats want YOU American Taxpayers to shell out $3 BILLION for ‘non-racist’ trees. You can't make this up."" The attack was made by FreedomWorks, a group that advocates for lower taxes and small government and has 4.4 million Facebook followers. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The phrase ""non-racist’ trees"" appears to be a mocking reference to a climate-change policy that proponents of the Democrats’ plans call tree equity. But the phrase mangles the definition of that concept. We asked FreedomWorks for information to back its claim. A spokesperson referred us to language in the bill. The $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill backed by Democrats includes many parts of President Joe Biden’s tax and spending proposals that have attracted little or no buy-in from Republicans, including expanded social programs and efforts to combat climate change.  Many in the GOP argue that the bill calls for too much spending, and that it could contribute to rising inflation. One provision proposes giving $3 billion in grants to state and local governments and nonprofits ""for tree planting and related activities to increase community tree canopy and associated societal and climate co-benefits, with a priority for projects that increase tree equity."" Priority would be given to ""a census block group in which 30% or more of the population lives below the poverty line; and a neighborhood with lower tree canopy and higher maximum daytime summer temperatures compared to surrounding neighborhoods""; and to ""underserved populations."" The conservation group American Forests issued a statement praising the bill.  The $3 billion would be an ""investment in planting equitable tree cover across our cities as protection against climate-fueled extreme heat and air pollution,"" the statement said. ""This new federal funding can feed the growing movement in cities across America, from Tucson to Boston, to make tree equity part of their push to equitably protect every neighborhood from climate change. This comes as some projections show we could see as many as 100,000 deaths per year in the U.S. from extreme heat before the end of the century."" The group’s website says trees are a ""pathway to social equity."" The group says trees absorb air pollutants, prevent heat-related deaths and illnesses, and reduce energy usage for heating and cooling — but that ""often in cities, trees are sparse in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods and some neighborhoods of color."" Bloomberg CityLab reported in August 2020 that cities across America are pledging to plant trees and restore urban forests to ""combat climate change and cool off disadvantaged communities."" FreedomWorks claimed in a Facebook post: ""The Democrats want you American taxpayers to shell out $3 billion for ‘non-racist’ trees."" The Democrats’ bill would set aside $3 billion to support tree planting with a priority for projects that increase tree equity. But FreedomWorks’ reference to ""non-racist trees"" distorts the notion of tree equity, which is to provide the health and environmental benefits that trees provide in low-income areas that currently lack tree cover.

McAuliffe flip-flops on qualified immunity
","During a Sept.16 gubernatorial debate, Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin accused Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe of flipping his position on qualified immunity - a law that conditionally protects police officers from being sued for violating people’s constitutional rights. ""What my opponent has done is completely recanted on what he said when he was trying to get the nomination, which is he would in fact reform or remove qualified immunity,"" Youngkin said. So we examined McAuliffe’s position through our Flip-O-Meter, which measures a candidate’s consistency on an issue. We found, as the Virginia Mercury has pointed out, that McAuliffe has made a big shift. Calls to end or reform qualified immunity swelled nationally after the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis policeman. Advocates said the increased threat of being personally sued would stop many police officers from using excessive force. Opponents said lowering legal protection would put more strain on officers who have to make snap judgments in sometimes dire circumstances. All four of McAuliffe’s opponents in the Democratic primary supported ending qualified immunity during a March 16 forum that McAuliffe did not attend. The issue gained momentum in Virginia when, on April 6, a video was published of Windsor police in December 2020 pepper spraying Army Lt. Caron Nazario after stopping him and pulling him from his car because they didn’t see a temporary license plate that was on his back window. Almost a week later, McAuliffe joined his four rivals in calling for qualified immunity.  The Mercury reported it had received on April 12 the following statement from McAuliffe spokesman Jake Rubenstein: ""For far too long, Virginia’s criminal justice system has unfairly targeted Black and brown people, and the horrific act against Army Lt. Caron Nazario is one of too many that show the critical need for continued reform. Terry believes Virginia must increase police accountability and transparency in incidents of misconduct, improve training, expand body-worn camera programs, and end policies like qualified immunity that can prevent accountability when heinous acts are committed against Virginians."" A nearly identical statement was attributed to McAuliffe, himself, in an April 24 Q&A interview published in The Virginian-Pilot and the Daily Press. McAuliffe said he would ""end policies like qualified immunity that can prevent accountability when heinous acts are committed against Virginians."" The McAuliffe campaign’s April statements have become an issue this fall. Youngkin, who supports qualified immunity and promises to improve public safety, has pointed to the issue as a key difference with his opponent. McAuliffe, in response, has said he strongly backed law enforcement during his previous term as governor, from 2014 to 2018, and increased proved officers’ pay. During the Sept. 16 debate, McAuliffe was asked if he would end qualified immunity. ""No, I would not end it,"" he said. ""It’s called qualified immunity for a reason. Any officer acting in good faith should and will have the full protections of the Commonwealth of Virginia. We don’t want anyone going out there putting their lives at risk and us not having their back. ""But if you have a law enforcement officer who breaks the law, that’s what qualified immunity is. That’s why we call it qualified immunity. But I will always step up and protect law enforcement. Because they’re out there everyday protecting us."" We asked McAuliffe’s campaign whether McAuliffe had changed his position on qualified immunity and got this statement from Rubenstein: ""As Terry has always made clear, any officer acting within the bounds of the law will have the full legal and civil protections of the Commonwealth of Virginia but that immunity does not qualify for those who break the law - as the name suggests. Terry is open to reforms that will ensure the law is working as intended - and still protects officers who follow the law."" On April 12, McAuliffe’s campaign issued a statement saying he wants to ""end policies like qualified immunity that can prevent accountability when heinous acts are committed against Virginians."" McAuliffe reiterated that stand on April 24.  Asked about qualified immunity on Sept. 16, McAuliffe said, ""No, I would not end it."" That rates a Full Flop.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BB37C0>],/factchecks/2021/sep/29/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-flip-flops-qualified-immunity/

Langley pointed to a Sept. 24 report from the CBC, a broadcast network.  When the CBC asked about the original video, Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health, said that the claims in it amounted to harmful misinformation.  Strang said that no such report about a 13-year-old girl was ever made to the paramedics with Nova Scotia’s Emergency Health Services, known as EHS, or to the IWK Health Centre, the province’s pediatric hospital in Halifax.

Video of the briefing continues to roll as Biden responds: ""There have been occasions when our military has contacted their military counterparts in the Taliban and said, ‘This…’ — for example, ‘This bus is coming through with X number of people on it, made up of the following group of people. We want you to let that bus or that group through.’ So, yes, there have been occasions like that.

Trump falsely describes Arizona audit findings
","A GOP-led review of 2 million ballots in Maricopa County, Ariz., confirmed on Sept. 24 what official election results showed months ago: Joe Biden won the county in the 2020 election. But speaking the next night to a crowd of fans in Georgia, Trump insisted that Biden lost.  ""We won on the Arizona forensic audit yesterday at a level that you wouldn’t believe,"" Trump said during a Sept. 25 ""Save America"" rally in Perry, Ga, referring to the ballot review ordered by Republicans in the Arizona state Senate.  ""They had headlines that Biden wins in Arizona when they know it’s not true,"" Trump added. ""He didn’t win in Arizona. He lost in Arizona based on the forensic audit."" In fact, the review found the exact opposite — that Biden had 45,469 more votes than Trump in Maricopa, roughly in line with the official results certified in November 2020. According to the report issued by Cyber Ninjas, the firm hired to conduct the review, Biden’s margin of victory was 360 votes larger than the county’s official canvass showed. ""There were no substantial differences between the hand count of the ballots provided and the official election canvass results for Maricopa County,"" the firm’s report said. Trump’s statement is ""complete nonsense,"" said Benny White, a Republican and longtime volunteer data analyst for the state Republican Party. (White had offered to help check the report’s findings but was turned down.) ""The official results are correct,"" White said. As for Trump, ""he lost."" Biden beat Trump in Arizona by about 10,500 votes, the first time a Democratic presidential nominee had won there since 1996. Trump spokespersons didn’t respond to our email asking for his evidence. While the Republicans have referred to the ballot review as an ""audit,"" election experts say that it did not follow typical post-election auditing procedures and lacked credibility. Meanwhile, during the rally, Trump made other claims about the review. We have fact-checked two of them: Trump said ""there were 17,322 duplicate ballots"" which a computer scientist identified as having ""surged right after the election was over.""   This is misleading. A scientist who has spread conspiracy theories in the past claimed that he had identified over 17,000 duplicate ballot envelope images. Duplicate ballot images aren’t the same thing as duplicate votes, and there is no evidence that illegitimate votes were duplicated as part of a voter fraud scheme. (There has been scant evidence of any voter fraud in Arizona.) Duplicate ballot envelopes are created when election officials contact voters with inconsistent or blank signatures to cure their signatures. Each set of ""duplicate"" images is counted only once. Arizona state law gives Maricopa County staff five business days after an election to contact voters with inconsistent signatures. As a result, there was a spike in duplicate envelopes after the election as workers contacted people who had cast their ballots on or shortly before Election Day, said Megan Gilbertson, a spokesperson for Maricopa Elections Department. Trump said that ""millions of election-related files were deleted,"" including ""a purge of the 'election management system' ... the day before the audit began."" The Maricopa County Elections Department has denied this, saying its 2020 election data was not deleted and instead was archived and backed up elsewhere, as is standard procedure before a forensic audit of ballot tabulation equipment, such as the one the county commissioned in February. Trump said Biden ""didn’t win in Arizona. He lost in Arizona based on the forensic audit."" That’s not true. The review found that Biden won Maricopa by 45,469 votes — a slightly larger margin than the county’s official canvass. And Biden won Arizona. Nothing in the report written by the Cyber Ninjas contractors stated otherwise.  We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

Did Richard Burr vote to protect tax breaks for companies that move overseas?
","An ad from Deborah Ross, the North Carolina Democrat running against Republican Sen. Richard Burr, paints Burr as a politician beholden to corporate interests. The ad, which first hit the airwaves in mid-October, features a young ex-Marine named Zach. ""He came back from Afghanistan and came home to a job as an electrician,"" the ad says. ""But every year, his paycheck doesn’t go as far. He just wants some economic security. Richard Burr voted to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas but voted against a tax break to help working people like Zach. Folks, that’s just wrong. Those aren’t our values."" We wanted to find out whether Ross was right that ""Richard Burr voted to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas but voted against a tax break to help working people."" It’s a frequent refrain of Ross’ campaign, and outside this ad she has repeated the claim in June, in September and at other times on the campaign trail. It’s also a line of attack other Democratic politicians across the country have used before – ranging from Barack Obama, in his 2014 State of the Union address, to a failed Senate candidate in Kentucky. But there’s a major caveat: Variations on this claim have received rulings like Mostly False or Half True on our Truth-O-Meter, depending on the way it was phrased. Given that the Ross-Burr race is one of the closest in the country, and North Carolina has been particularly hard-hit by the outsourcing of factory jobs, we decided to take a look at how much truth there was to Ross’ claim. Ross' ad is talking about a bill called the ""Bring Jobs Home Act,"" which Senate Democrats tried to pass in 2012 and 2014. It failed both years due to opposition from Republicans, and both years Burr did vote against it. Burr also joined his fellow Republicans in voting against a 2010 bill that had similar provisions, called the ""Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act."" The goal of the bills There is no tax break for companies that move overseas, so the claim is slightly misleading on that account. There are tax breaks, however, for any U.S. company that relocates – whether it’s to the other side of town or the other side of the world. The bills that Burr voted against would have created a new tax incentive for companies that moved jobs back to the United States from overseas. They also would have exempted overseas moves from the types of relocation that can receive tax breaks. So the claim itself has the facts of the bill basically right, although it leaves room for people to get the wrong impression. The money angle Tax experts have repeatedly told PolitiFact that the bills were almost entirely symbolic. That’s because the punishments or rewards companies might have received would’ve been insignificant – not nearly large enough to change their behavior and either bring jobs back or stop jobs from leaving. An analysis by Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation showed the U.S. government would have lost $214 million between 2015 and 2024 if the 2014 version of the bill had passed. But for the sake of not trying to look into the future, let’s just take a look at the 2015 estimates. Companies that outsourced in 2015 would have lost $9 million that year if the bill had passed, the committee found. Meanwhile, companies that insourced would’ve received $19 million in tax breaks. Those numbers are minuscule. Corporations were expected to pay $341.7 billion in income taxes in 2015, according to the Tax Policy Center, a branch of the left-of-center Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. The $9 million in extra payments represents 0.0026 percent of the total corporate income taxes. That’s a quarter of a hundredth of 1 percent. The $19 million in savings isn’t much more significant, representing 0.0056 percent of the total. Wouldn't have changed corporate strategies Tax experts have previously opined, looking at similar numbers, that the bill simply would not have done enough to persuade any major company to change its business plan. ""It adds up to a trivial amount of money,"" James Hines, a professor of law and economics at the University of Michigan, told PolitiFact for a 2014 fact check. ""Given how many big multinational firms we have, it’s impossible that it has any effect on their behavior."" Howard Gleckman, a researcher at the Tax Policy Center, agreed. ""For many multinationals, the credit would be largely meaningless,"" he wrote. ""Those firms already pay close to a zero U.S. tax rate thanks to their ability to shift income to low-tax countries. With their U.S. tax liability already low, the credit would do almost nothing to encourage them to shift operations to the U.S."" Our ruling Ross said that Burr ""voted to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas but voted against a tax break to help working people."" PolitiFact has docked points on several versions of this same claim in the past, in large part because it oversimplifies the bills in question and doesn’t account for the fact that experts don’t think the bills would have done anything to keep jobs in the United States, or bring them back, had the changes become law. Burr did vote against the bills in question – inconsequential though they might have been – so there is a sliver of truth here. But the reality of the situation isn’t nearly so cut-and-dried as Ross describes it.

Ron Johnson: Opponent Russ Feingold ""got paid $8,000 a lecture at Stanford University.""
","An Oct. 6, 2016 campaign ad from U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson delves into former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold’s finances. Feingold ""got paid $8,000 a lecture at Stanford University,"" the ad claims. We decided to check it out. Johnson’s campaign sent us three links as backup: -- Feingold’s 2015 personal financial disclosure form, in which he reports that he was paid $150,000 by Stanford in 2015. -- The description of the cross-listed class he taught at Stanford in the spring of 2015, ""Implications of Post-1994 Conflicts in Great Lakes Region of Africa: an American Perspective."" -- The description of the class he taught at Stanford in the fall of 2015, ""The United States Senate as a Legal Institution."" Feingold was a visiting professor at the School of Law and a distinguished lecturer at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, according to Stanford University. By our math, based on the course descriptions on Stanford’s website, there were 10 lectures in the first class and nine in the second, for a total of 19 lectures in those classes over the two terms. If you take $150,000 and divide it by 19, you get approximately $7,895 per lecture. That’s pretty close to the $8,000 mentioned. But that math ignores the work Feingold did outside of class. According to the campaign,  Feingold graded term papers, prepared for each lecture and held office hours for two hours a week for both classes. He also gave lectures for the campus and was a guest lecturer in other courses, according to the campaign. Larry Kramer was the Law School’s dean at the time and said he recruited Feingold for the expertise Feingold could offer the university and its students. Feingold was a U.S. senator from 1993 to 2011, after losing the 2010 election to Johnson. He soon became the United States Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region of Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo at the State Department. Kramer said Feingold’s duties included teaching but also many other responsibilities. (Kramer gave $2,000 last year to Feingold’s campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records.) He said that the university does not pay per lecture. ""Of course we don't pay that way,"" he said. ""Nobody gets paid that way at the university. We don’t even think about it that way."" Stanford wouldn’t comment on its compensation programs, including whether pay is at all tied to the number of classes or lectures taught. However, Brad Hayward, senior director of strategic communications at the university, confirmed that Feingold had responsibilities outside of the lectures. ""The responsibilities of teaching at Stanford do involve significant work outside of in-class time,"" Hayward wrote in an email. ""In addition to those teaching responsibilities, Mr. Feingold guest-lectured in other classes, delivered a public lecture, and was available to students and colleagues as a member of our academic community."" Johnson claims Feingold ""got paid $8,000 a lecture at Stanford University."" While the math may be right, or close to it, the claim implies that the number of lectures is somehow tied to pay grade and ignores the other work required outside of class.

Mostly False: Jimmy Flannigan's claim he's responsible for Anderson Mill Road on Austin ballot
","Community activist Jimmy Flannigan argues he has done more for Northwest Austin than his opponent to represent District 6 on the Austin City Council, incumbent Don Zimmerman. His case in point: Anderson Mill Road. Flannigan has repeatedly said at candidate forums and in interviews that he and his Northwest Austin Coalition deserve the credit for persuading Mayor Steve Adler to put $5.5 million for the notoriously traffic-jammed Anderson Mill Road in Austin’s proposed $720 million transportation bond. It’s one of more than 30 projects listed by name in the Nov. 8, 2016, ballot proposition. Flannigan told the online Austin Monitor, which focuses on local government news: ""Anderson Mill Road was included in Mayor Adler’s transportation bond explicitly because of the work we did with the Northwest Austin Coalition."" Monitor publisher Michael Kanin pressed during their exchange, posted Sept. 12, 2016 and later cited in an Oct. 21, 2016, Zimmerman press release: ""Just to be crystal clear here, it was the mayor's office that told you it was because of your work..."" Flannigan: ""Yes."" Kanin: ""...And not (the work of) council member (Don) Zimmerman."" Flannigan: ""Yes."" Flannigan made nearly identical claims at a Sept. 15, 2016, candidate forum organized by the City of Austin and the Austin-area League of Women Voters and a forum hosted a week later by the West Austin Chamber of Commerce. At those forums and in his Oct. 21 press release, Zimmerman called Flannigan’s assertions a lie. Zimmerman noted that he held a 2015 town hall meeting, attended by Flannigan and Adler, in which city staffers talked about potential solutions for Anderson Mill Road. Zimmerman’s statement also pointed out he proposed redirecting $2.2 million in transportation funding in August 2015 to study fixes for the road; that pitch did not draw council support. Zimmerman’s 2016 press release said: ""Everyone in District 6 knows that Anderson Mill Road is a key artery that needs to be improved. Multiple groups have been working on fixing Anderson Mill Road."" Building the bond So, how did various clogged roads end up in the proposed $720 million transportation bond? Adler, who first floated the idea of a big transportation bond plan in late 2015, took the lead on crafting the proposal. Three memos provided by Adler’s office and the city’s capital projects office offer insight. It looks to us like much of the ballot proposal drew from a June 13, 2016, Austin Transportation Department memo listing long-sought overhauls on seven major roads such as East Riverside Drive, North Lamar Boulevard and South Lamar Boulevard, in which engineering work was complete or underway. That memo also listed other critical stretches of roads, such as Anderson Mill Road between RM 620 and Parmer Lane. A second staff memo -- sent to Adler and the council on June 16, 2016 -- estimated it would cost $5.5 million to expand and improve a shorter stretch of Anderson Mill Road, between RM 620 and U.S. 183. The same day, Adler included the $5.5 million for Anderson Mill Road in his first public draft of possible bond projects. Five days later, city staff distributed a third memo, which also included Anderson Mill Road and estimated the size and scope of the work that could be done for different bond amounts. For example, that memo shows a $250 million bond would not include work on Anderson Mill Road, while a $720 million bond package would. Credit from the mayor? In the September Monitor interview, Flannigan said the ""mayor’s office told"" him that it was his work that got Anderson Mill in the bond. Just after the Monitor published the interview, though, Adler emailed his staff, asking: ""Has anyone in our office made such a statement? Should someone call Jimmy and find out why he said that?"" Zimmerman’s campaign initially provided a copy of that email, which we independently obtained and verified. By phone, Adler staff adviser John-Michael Cortez offered a different description of Flannigan’s role in getting Anderson Mill added to the bond. Cortez recalled Flannigan as ""one of many people who highlighted specific (transportation) improvements in Northwest Austin."" While Cortez said that he met with Flannigan and his group before the bond’s summer 2016 rollout, he added that Flannigan ""not the only one who highlighted it as an important improvement."" Cortez added: ""I doubt I ever said it was because of his efforts, but his efforts certainly were helpful in making that project a priority."" In an October 2016 phone interview with us, Adler took the same line. ""These are conversations that have been going on in that community for years. Everyone was aware those conversations were going on,"" Adler said. ""They were conversations that I heard when I was campaigning two years ago."" Flannigan subsequently stood by his earlier statement that the mayor’s office had credited him with getting Anderson Mill into the bond. Asked to identify who in Adler’s office told him so, Flannigan didn’t say. By email, he responded: ""At no point was I told that others had asked for the road to be included."" Corridor study Flannigan has touted a ""citizen-led"" corridor study as one of the ways the Northwest Austin Coalition, which he founded, pushed to include Anderson Mill improvements in the bond. ""When I brought that study to city staff and the mayor’s office, they got the road included in the bond,"" Flannigan said at the League of Women Voters forum. ""That is a fact."" A corridor study would be hard to miss. The typically binder-sized reports are full of painstaking schematics, diagrams and traffic projections that lay out proposed improvements and the effects they’ll have on neighborhoods and businesses. As an example, the December 2013 corridor study for East Riverside Drive runs 277 pages. When we inquired about an Anderson Mill corridor study, though, Adler spokesman Jason Stanford and a transportation department spokeswoman, Marissa Monroy, each said by phone that city files didn’t show any study submitted by Flannigan’s group. When we emailed Flannigan’s campaign to ask for a copy, his campaign manager, Allison Heinrich, provided a link to an interactive map on the Northwest Austin Coalition’s website, where users could post complaints about the road. By email, Flannigan later acknowledged he hadn’t submitted the complaints or users’ suggestions to City Hall. ""Since everything was public and online, it didn't require being sent,"" he wrote, ""it was part of the public conversation."" A city survey Flannigan also cited his group’s efforts to press for Anderson Mill improvements through the city’s 2015 transportation survey, MobilityATX, which asked residents for opinions on transportation needs online and during in-person public meetings. The top recommendation from the 1,039 Austinites who participated in the nonscientific MobilityATX survey: Building out the city's bike lane network, followed by burying Interstate 35 through downtown and expanding dedicated bus lanes. Tied for fourth, with 112 votes: Improving Anderson Mill Road between U.S. 183 and FM 620 and encouraging developers to build denser housing in central city neighborhoods. Cortez, Adler’s aide, suggested that Flannigan overplayed the importance of the 2015 survey to what made it into the bond package. ""I think generally it played the role of getting people interested and excited about making some progress about our mobility challenges,"" Cortez said. ""It just daylighted some priorities that some interested stakeholders had."" Our ruling Flannigan said he’s responsible for Anderson Mill Road being part of the city’s proposed transportation bond issue. No doubt, Flannigan advocated for improvements to the road to be part of the 2016 bond proposal lately before Austin voters. Then again, Flannigan didn’t provide nor did we find independent indications that he himself caused the road to land on the ballot. We rate this claim Mostly False.

A month after the story first posted, readers asked if the story about massive fraud in a crucial swing-state could be true. Far from it. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted issued a press release Sept. 30 knocking down the falsehood. ""As a Christian myself, I take offense to reading such unbelievable lies from a publication alleging Christian ties,"" Husted wrote. ""No one from this so-called news outlet bothered to call the Franklin County Board of Elections or the Ohio Secretary of State’s office to verify any facts. It was a deliberate attempt to deceive and mislead. We already get enough of that from the candidates. Enough already."" PolitiFact Ohio attempted to trace the origin of the photo that ran with the online story:  The urban legend busters at Snopes beat us to it, linking to what appears to be the original photo from the Birmingham Mail in England, published in 2015. It looks like the Christian Times Newsletter flipped the original image and scrubbed off some of the ""Ballot Box"" labels on the bins. The Christian Times Newsletter identified the man in their photo as Columbus-area electrical worker Randall Prince, and said he discovered the ballots while ""doing a routine check"" of his company’s wiring and electrical systems. (We left a message for a person with that name but did not hear back by deadline.) The article alleged that the plan was to slip the fake ballots in with real ones when delivered to official election judges on Nov. 8. The Franklin County Board of Elections told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that each ballot box, if real, would be secured with a double lock that must be opened with an official from each political party. The article alleging vote mishandling has popped up on various other websites. PolitiFact Ohio reached out via an online form to the Christian Times Newsletter but has not yet received a response. The Christian Times Newsletter does not call itself a fake-news site. Subscribers are told ""each and every email you receive from us will be intrinsically priceless.""

","Hillary Clinton says that as president, she would ""tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America,"" while her opponent Donald Trump would ""do nothing."" At a rally in Cincinnati eight days before Election Day, Clinton explained how she and Trump differ on the issue of guns. The National Rifle Association endorsed Trump, and ""in return"" Trump has adopted various anti-gun control positions, she said. ""He’s even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms,"" Clinton said. ""How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?"" We wondered if Trump really has said he’d put allowing guns in classrooms at the top of his priorities list. Throughout the election, he has advocated for getting rid of gun-free zones at schools and military bases, arguing that this could prevent mass shootings in these types of locations. And he did say once during the primary that he would get rid of these zones on his first day in office. ""I will get rid of gun-free zones in schools, and — you have to — and on military bases, he said at a Jan. 7 rally in Vermont. ""On my first day, it gets signed, okay, my first day. There’s no more gun-free zones."" The Outdoor Channel asked Trump about this plan in an interview two weeks later. ""I’m going to get rid of gun-free zones on military bases and I’m also going to do it in schools,"" he said, adding that he would try to ""work with the states"" or ""perhaps override the states if I have to."" The topic came up again in May, when Trump accepted the NRA’s endorsement. In the days that followed, he waffled on whether he wants schools to allow guns on campus. In his May 20 speech accepting the endorsement, he said, ""We're getting rid of gun-free zones, okay. I can tell you that. We're getting rid of them."" On May 21, Trump tweeted: ""Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!"" He then made a seemingly contradictory claim on Fox News the next day, May 22: He doesn’t advocate for guns in the classroom, but sometimes teachers should have guns in the classroom. ""I don’t want to have guns in classrooms,"" he said. ""Although, in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms, frankly. Because teachers are, you know. Things that are going on in our schools are unbelievable. You look at some of our schools, unbelievable what’s going on. But I’m not advocating guns in classrooms. But remember, in some cases, and a lot of people have made this case, teachers should be able to have guns. Trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms."" We looked through other transcripts and interviews Trump has given since May, but we were unable to find further clarification about his position. His campaign did not respond to our request for comment. One final note: It’s highly unlikely Trump could let people carry guns onto school property on his first day in office. Regulations against possessing or firing a gun in a school zone is written into federal law and would take congressional approval to overturn. Meanwhile, states have their own laws prohibiting guns in schools that would need to be repealed, as well. Our ruling Clinton said of Trump, ""He even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms."" Trump did say once during the primary that he would eliminate gun-free zones at schools on his first day in office. He later said he thought that trained teachers specifically should be able to have guns in the classroom. Clinton’s claim is True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d34ef4ef-ace5-4226-8a3a-6da72ee9a39c

Fact-checking Donald Trump on FBI probe into Clinton emails
","Donald Trump sounded off a scary Halloween message about Hillary Clinton and the latest developments in her email controversy, which he dubbed ""the biggest scandal since Watergate."" ""As you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton and discovered — you heard this yesterday, it’s hard to believe — and discovered another 650,000 emails. Hillary lied under oath when she said she turned over all of her work-related emails – just one more lie out of so many,"" Trump said at a Oct. 31 campaign stop in Michigan. Trump is referring to FBI Director James Comey’s Oct. 28 letter informing Congress that the bureau is looking to examine new evidence potentially relevant to Clinton’s case. But his description is slightly misleading, and the letter did not say anything about the amount of emails involved. First, the FBI didn’t exactly ""reopen"" the investigation, as it wasn’t formally closed. We can certainly say the FBI is looking into a case that had previously been inactive. Trump is less accurate when he suggests the FBI has discovered hundreds of thousands of new emails relevant to the Clinton case. The number, given to the Wall Street Journal by unnamed sources, refers to the total number of emails found in a separate investigation. It’s unclear how many actually pertain to Clinton and how many are actually new. The 650,000 emails As PolitiFact has reported, unnamed FBI officials told journalists that the new focus began when the FBI found emails on a laptop seized from former New York congressman Anthony Weiner, who is under investigation for allegedly exchanging sexually explicit messages with a 15-year-old girl. Weiner is separated from Huma Abedin, a longtime aide to Clinton. Investigators found a total of 650,000 emails on Weiner’s laptop, anonymous sources told the Wall Street Journal. But it remains to be seen how many of those emails involve Clinton, how many are work-related, how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the FBI and whether they contain classified information. The Journal goes on to say that ""thousands"" could have been sent to or from Clinton’s email server. The Washington Post reported that there are more than 1,000 from the server (though it’s unclear if that refers to the number of threads or individual emails). Other news reports indicate the majority of the 650,000 emails are not related to the Clinton case and the FBI will be examining a small portion of them. A reopened case? Trump, and other Republicans, have said the FBI has ""reopened"" the investigation into Clinton, while the Clinton camp and others reject that characterization, pointing out neither Comey’s three-paragraph letter to Congress nor a memo he sent to FBI employees uses the word. On one level, this is a bit of semantic quibbling. Former FBI officials told us ""reopening"" is an imprecise word choice, but it gets at the gist of the latest development. It is likely that the FBI had not administratively closed the Clinton case, though it was no longer an active investigation. On another level, experts told the word ""reopens"" could imply that officials have found a smoking gun, but that conclusion is premature. FBI cases are ""opened,"" per management assessment, when there is sufficient information for an investigation. They are ""closed,"" also per a management decision, when there is no more investigative or administrative work to be done. ""Opening and closing a case is really a matter of preparing an internal communication setting forth the reasons for doing so and having the supervisory chain of command agree with that decision,"" said Nancy Savage, who served in the FBI for 35 years as a special agent and as a management official. Clearly, the Clinton email investigation (as well as the Weiner case) was officially opened. But while Comey shared the results of the Clinton email investigation in July 2016, ""Comey had not indicated that the Clinton email case was ever formally closed,"" said Mark Pollitt, a former FBI special agent and director who now teaches at Syracuse University. ""Given the size and scope of the case, I would be surprised it all the paperwork was done yet,"" Pollitt said. He pointed out that the Clinton investigation had to be active in order for the FBI to obtain a warrant to search Weiner’s emails for Clinton-related exchanges. So essentially, the case was ""reopened"" in the sense that the FBI ""moved from the administrative wind-up stage back into the active investigative stage,"" Savage said. Finally, experts cautioned against reading too much into this new development. ""There is nothing unusual about this investigation being pursued. It is standard operating procedure,"" Savage said, adding that Comey simply notified Congress that there was new information that required further investigation. ""The FBI more than likely did not know and still does not know what all the information means on this computer, which should have (been) turned over much earlier by Abedin."" ""The act of reopening a case does not point to any conclusions and is an administrative action within the scope of the earlier review of emails,"" said Ellen Glasser, a former FBI special agent and supervisor. ""Any suggestion that there is a smoking gun, based solely on reopening the case, would be incorrect."" Our ruling Trump said, ""The FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton ... and discovered another 650,000 emails."" Trump has a point that the FBI had stopped actively investigating Clinton emails until the latest development. But experts told us it’s unlikely it was ever formally closed, so ""reopen"" is an imprecise word. The bigger factual issue is his number. The 650,000 emails were discovered in a separate investigation, and it is not clear just how many are related to Clinton and how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the FBI. Reports indicate that the bureau is examining just a small portion of the 650,000 emails. We rate Trump’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a4340f93-174b-4501-8531-b8b98dd2e7e1",[<zip object at 0x00000280967AAD80>],/factchecks/2016/nov/01/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trump-fbi-probe-clinton-email/

NRCC says Morgan Carroll 'opposed' tracking sexual predators. But she wanted stronger enforcement
","The rating of this fact-check has been changed since it was first published. See editor's note at the bottom. The dogfight over Colorado’s 6th Congressional District is getting nastier as Election Day nears. The National Republican Congressional Committee hammered U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman’s Democratic opponent, state Sen. Morgan Carroll, with two ads echoing the same theme: She was weak on enforcement of sexual predators in the state Legislature. The suburban Denver district is one the of most hotly contested battlegrounds in the nation. We examined an ad called ""The Only One,"" which features a chorus of women condemning Carroll’s actions on two bills. ""Morgan Carroll opposed requiring convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, making it harder to track online sex offenders and child predators,"" two women say. ""And Morgan Carroll was the only one to vote against tougher penalties for child predators using the internet,"" another woman says. ""The only one...the only one...the only one,"" several women chime in. The NRCC ad cherry-picked votes Carroll made against bills she considered flawed. The ad also leaves out that Carroll voted for House passage of the legislation after she believed it had been improved. We’re fact-checking the statement that ""Morgan Carroll opposed requiring convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, making it harder to track online sex offenders and child predators."" In support of the claim, the NRCC pointed to a 2007 bill that Carroll voted on several times as a state representative. The bill sought to require convicted sex offenders register all their email addresses, instant-messaging identities and chat-room identities with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. It would have also required the CBI to include the information on the Colorado Crime Information Center database, which is shared with state criminal justice agencies. The measure had the support of Colorado Attorney General John Suthers and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Metro Denver. But Democratic lawmakers -- and even some technology experts -- questioned the three-page bill’s enforceability. ""You can create a brand new email address in minutes,"" Steve Walden, an executive at Pitney Bowes Group 1 Software, told the Denver Post at the time. ""I think the intent here is that various chat-room communities can flag these users while they're online,"" said Walden, whose firm developed software that allows people to use online maps to see how close they live to registered sex offenders. ""The Internet is one of those domains where they can roam with complete anonymity. Tying an email address to a person is a very difficult thing to do."" Carroll campaign spokesman Drew Godinich said she was all for tracking sex offenders online, but she believed flaws in the bill would allow predators to evade detection.     ""There was no provision in the email portion of the bill that would guarantee that someone's email address actually belonged to that person. If someone had to register as a sex offender, they could -- under this bill -- create an email under a fake name and there was no enforcement,"" Godinich said. After the bill's enforceability was questioned by lawmakers and during public testimony at a committee hearing, Carroll voted with other Democrats to kill it. What the NRCC ad doesn't mention is that three weeks later, a new, more comprehensive bill for online tracking of sex offenders was introduced. The bill required that law enforcement agencies ""make a reasonable effort to verify all email addresses provided by the (sex offender)."" It also required that the registration form a sex offender must fill out contains a warning that providing false information for their email, instant-messaging and chat-room identities ""may constitute a misdemeanor or felony offense.""   Carroll joined a bipartisan group of 59 lawmakers in voting for final House passage of the stronger bill (HB07-1326). The ad leaves out that inconvenient fact. However, there was another twist. The Senate stripped out the House language requiring law enforcement to verify the email addresses a sex offender registers. So Carroll voted against the weakened conference committee bill that became law. Carroll's spokesman said she supported sex offender tracking but voted against the bill that weakened enforcement of tracking. NRCC spokesman Zach Hunter told us, ""While legislating may be a messy process, when Morgan Carroll was faced with the binary choice of supporting or opposing legislation that would require convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, Carroll opposed the bill. If all legislators had voted like Carroll, the bill would have failed and no further protections for our most vulnerable would have become law."" A word about the second claim While the ad's second claim — ""Morgan Carroll was the only one to vote against tougher penalties for child predators using the internet"" — is not on the Truth-O-Meter, it’s worth reviewing because it’s also misleading. It refers to a 2009 bill that sought to update the state law against internet luring of a child to include texting and instant-messaging. It also would have allowed a judge to consider a defendant's prior sex offense convictions in other states when weighing the severity of sentencing. The bill passed the House. When it came to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Carroll was serving, she joined the unanimous vote to advance the bill. Then the sausage-making of legislation got messy. Two Republican senators each successfully added an amendment to the bill, which passed in the initial Senate floor vote. One amendment would have increased the penalty for failing to register as a sex offender. The other amendment would have added prohibitions against providing sexually explicit material -- pornography -- to children.   Carroll objected to the amendments, saying they violated the Colorado Constitution’s requirement that each bill only contain a single subject, which must be clearly expressed in the bill title, her spokesman said. The purpose of the constitutional provision is in part to prevent ""log-rolling,"" where lawmakers bundle together unrelated measures to win votes for passage, according to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Legal Services. Carroll also argued that the bill needed a new fiscal note because the amendments would boost its cost, Godinich added. This is how Carroll became the lone vote against final Senate passage of the bill. But it didn't end there. The House rejected the Senate amendments. And a conference committee, where lawmakers iron out the two chambers' differences on a bill, stripped out the amendments. In the end, Carroll voted with unanimous Senate passage (HB09-1163) of the original bill to increase penalties for online child predators  -- which the TV ad, again, failed to mention. Our ruling The NRCC said, ""Morgan Carroll opposed requiring convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, making it harder to track online sex offenders and child predators."" The NRCC blows one of Carroll's committee votes out of proportion to make it sound like she was philosophically against this policy. Carroll did vote to kill the orginal sex offender bill in committee, because she -- along with other Democrats -- said the bill lacked language to prevent a sex offender from creating an email address with a fake name to evade tracking. But she voted for successful passage of another tracking bill with teeth when it was in the House. It required law enforcement to verify a sex offender's email addresses, and it carried criminal penalties for anyone who provides false information about their email or other online identities. When that bill came back from the Senate, the tougher enforcement measures had been stripped out, and Carroll voted against it. The NRCC ad ultimately distorts Carroll's position by saying she opposed making sex offenders register their online profiles when she actually fought for tougher enforcement. We rate this statement Mostly False. Editor's note: This fact-check originally posted with a rating of False. Shortly after publication, the NRCC pointed out Carroll's vote against the final measure when it came back from the Senate, which we did not consider. We updated the piece and revised the rating. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/967b2e0d-12c3-4508-9b55-838e2db70b9c

New ad claiming Catherine Cortez Masto indicted Harry Reid's political opponent needs context
","Catherine Cortez Masto’s record as Nevada’s attorney general is yet again under fire in the waning days of Nevada’s highly competitive U.S. Senate race. A new ad from Republican Rep. Joe Heck’s campaign features the 18-year-old daughter of former Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki claiming that Cortez Masto ""was willing to hurt me and my sisters and my family"" by trying to prosecute her father during her time as the state’s attorney general. ""Catherine Cortez Masto indicted my father, who was an innocent man, in order to save Harry Reid's political career,"" she says in the ad. Cortez Masto’s decision to pursue felony charges against Krolicki has long been used as a prime example of her close relationship with senior Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, as the charges came only a few weeks after Krolicki began exploring a run against Reid in 2010. The case against Krolicki was thrown out before it went to trial, so he’s technically innocent in the eyes of the law. But the decision to indict didn’t appear out of thin air, as the Republican had previously been the target of a probe into possible financial mismanagement of a state-run program. An audit and an indictment The charges stem from a 2007 audit of a state college savings program overseen by Krolicki during his time as the state treasurer (a partisan, elected position in Nevada) and alleging that he mismanaged the program’s finances. The audit found the $3.3 billion program, which gives parents options for tax-free investments toward future college costs, failed to follow standard state budgeting procedures and that more than $6 million in collected fees wasn’t being deposited into official accounts and were instead directly allocated toward other program costs. This so-called ""off-line budgeting"" was used for a variety of purposes, including nearly $1 million in legal fees and $1.5 million for an advertising campaign for the program featuring Krolicki as the program’s spokesman — meaning the office substantially overspent the budget approved by state lawmakers. The audit accounted for all of the money collected and spent by the program, and Krolicki was never accused of pocketing the money or otherwise enriching himself (though the indictment said he benefited politically from appearing in advertising). Krolicki, for his part, denied any wrongdoing (telling a reporter ""I sleep very well at night"") and characterized the audit as a struggle between the legislative and executive branches of state government, saying he relied on advice from public and private counsel and even clearing the disputed contracts with the attorney general’s office. ""In my view, he hadn’t done anything wrong,"" Scott Scherer, Krolicki’s attorney at the time, told PolitiFact. ""This was merely a dispute over process."" Former Democratic Assemblywoman Chris Giunchigliani, who testified as a witness during the grand jury hearing on Krolicki, told PolitiFact that Krolicki likely violated the state’s budget act by going around state lawmakers and having no legislative oversight on the program’s spending. ""I felt it was a maneuver to go around what the legislature budgeted,"" she said. ""Why would you even call a grand jury if it wasn’t something inappropriate?"" Cortez Masto’s office sought and obtained a grand jury indictment against Krolicki and his chief of staff Kathy Besser on felony charges related to the audit in December 2008. Krolicki actually broke the news himself, holding an hour-long press conference days before the indictment came out and decrying Cortez Masto as engaged in a ""partisan witch hunt."" The Republican pleaded not guilty to all charges, and the case quickly turned into a fight over whether or not the Attorney General’s office had a conflict of interest in prosecuting a fellow state official to whom her office and previously provided legal counsel, including on contracts related to the College Savings program. Cortez Masto was forced to seek an expensive special prosecutor for the case after a judge disqualified her office due to a ""conflict of interest"" and district attorneys in Reno and Las Vegas declined to take up the case. Ultimately, a judge dismissed the indictment ""without prejudice"" after finding it to be overly vague and lacking detail. Krolicki immediately declared himself vindicated while Cortez Masto later told reporters that he got off on a technicality, though declining to appeal the decision or present it to another grand jury. So is it fair to describe Krolicki as innocent? Because the case never went to trial and was dismissed for reasons other than the actual merits of the case, Krolicki is innocent in the eyes of the law. But other commentators have pointed out that although the Republican declared himself vindicated immediately following the court’s decision, no court or jury ever ruled on whether or not Krolicki actually violated state law. ""It left the AG’s office hanging and it left Brian (Krolicki) hanging because the ultimate question was never answered,"" Giunchigliani said. Do ""all roads"" lead to Reid? It’s much more difficult to blame Reid for the case being brought forward. From the beginning, Krolicki sought to cast the indictment as a ""witch hunt"" born of ""partisan malice"" and immediately brought up the longtime Nevada senator’s name as a possible instigator. ""All Democratic partisan roads lead to Harry Reid,"" he said at the time. ""Reid has a long reach across the country."" The indictment did come just a few weeks after Krolicki publicly began exploring a run to unseat Reid, but Cortez Masto fervently denied any communication or influence from Reid, as did the senior Nevada senator. And auditors actually started digging into the case in 2007, after Krolicki’s successor in the treasurer’s office asked for a third-party audit into ""irregularities"" in how the program’s money was being managed — long before Krolicki announced his desire to challenge Reid. Krolicki never presented any hard evidence that Reid was involved with the case. Nevada political commentator Jon Ralston opined at the time that even if Reid tried to influence Cortez Masto, the ""apolitical and by-the-book"" attorney general would have likely ignored him anyways. Krolicki elected not to get involved in the contested Republican Senate primary, and Reid ended up defeating Republican Sharron Angle in the 2010 election by a 50 to 44 percent margin. Richard Wright, Krolicki’s attorney at the time, said he didn’t hold Cortez Masto to blame because the prosecution was driven more by one of her deputies than by the attorney general herself. ""It’s like Catherine’s the CEO, the president of the big corporation, and I understand where responsibility goes, but it’s not like she was directing it or had anything to do it,"" he said. ""If there’s any criticism, it would be lack of supervision."" Wright said the same prosecutor brought a similar criminal case against former Las Vegas City Councilwoman Janet Moncrief, but that he didn’t hold it against the then-Attorney General and current Gover. Brian Sandoval. Cortez Masto both in 2009 and more recently maintained that she never spoke with Reid about bringing charges against Krolicki and told a PolitiFact Nevada reporter that ""we treated (it) just like any other case."" The ad also cites a Las Vegas Sun analysis of the case’s fallout on Cortez Masto’s political future, using a text overlay of ""Masto ... hyperpartisan"" and ""prosecutorial misconduct."" That’s slightly out of context — those quotes are related more to how the case could be perceived rather than any editorial judgement being passed by the Sun. The full quotes say, ""Cortez Masto opened herself to charges of politicizing her office and prosecutorial misconduct"" and ""appeared to be hyperpartisan."" Our ruling A new Heck campaign ad claims Cortez Masto indicted ""an innocent man, in order to save Harry Reid's political career."" Cortez Masto did pursue felony charges against Krolicki, and the case was thrown out by judge on separate, unrelated charges. The indictment itself was controversial, and it is technically accurate to say Krolicki is innocent. But the ad ignores important context and unresolved issues with his financial management of state’s college savings program under Krolicki. Although the timing of the indictment might have been politically fortuitous for Reid, there’s no public evidence that he was involved with this case. Because this ad leaves out important details but is still partially accurate, we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8e2207a8-da4b-4042-b846-57f9a2b6eca3",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AC8680>],/factchecks/2016/nov/01/joe-heck/new-ad-claiming-catherine-cortez-masto-indicted-ha/

Pro-Clinton Super PAC says Trump wants to deport millions, including 'Dreamers'
","An ad by a political action committee supporting Hillary Clinton spotlights Donald Trump’s comments on deporting undocumented immigrant families. The ad, launched by Priorities USA Action on Sept. 28, is narrated in Spanish and includes snippets of media interviews in which the Republican presidential candidate firmly said he would deport people in the country illegally. It starts with Trump’s voice saying ""this is a country where we speak English, not Spanish"" over an image of a woman and two children sitting at a dining table. ""Donald Trump wants to see us disappear,"" a female voice says in Spanish. It then cuts to a November 2015 MSNBC interview where Trump said ""you are going to have a deportation force."" ""Trump will capture and deport millions, even our Dreamers,"" the narrator says in Spanish as images of a family and what appears to be a student fade away. Trump has not been consistent on his deportation plans. But in his immigration speech in Arizona on Aug. 31, Trump emphasized deportation priorities and the removal of ""at least 2 million"" ""criminal aliens."" He also said those who are here illegally and want lawful status, ""will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry."" There’s an estimated 11 million people living illegally in the United States. For this fact-check, we focused on whether or not Trump wants to deport people in the country illegally who arrived in the United States as children, a subset of the undocumented population referred to as Dreamers. Who are Dreamers? ""Dreamers"" is a term used by advocates for potential beneficiaries of the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, or the DREAM Act, which has stalled in Congress. President Barack Obama’s administration in 2012 announced a program to help this group of undocumented immigrants, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It allowed those who met certain guidelines to apply for work permits and for deportation reprieve for two years, subject to renewal. Pew Research Center in 2012 estimated there were 4.4 million unauthorized immigrants ages 30 and under, and that up to 1.7 million were potentially eligible for DACA. Data through June 2016 shows 741,546 individuals nationwide have been approved for DACA. Obama in 2014 sought to offer deportation relief to more people through two more programs: an expanded version of DACA, and a new program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA. While the initial deferred-action program is still active, the expansions are on hold after a Supreme Court deadlock. About 5 million people might be eligible for the halted initiatives, or just less than half of the nation’s undocumented population. Trump’s position Trump would ""immediately terminate President Obama’s two illegal executive amnesties,"" according to his 10-point immigration plan. (Neither program granted citizenship, but deferred deportation and allowed immigrants to apply for permission to work.) Trump’s plan says his administration would enforce all immigration laws and set priorities — including the removal of criminals, gang members and visa overstays. ""Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation — that is what it means to have laws and to have a country,"" his plan says. It is not clear if Trump would cancel the existing deferred-action program or just not issue any new ones, said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter immigration policies. Toward the end of his immigration speech, Trump also said that after building a wall, ending illegal immigration, and accomplishing enforcement and deportation goals, ""then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain."" Priorities USA led us to a July 2015 CNN interview between Trump and Dana Bash, where she asked him specifically whether or not he would deport Dreamers. Trump responded with a mixed message. ""It's a tough situation,"" Trump said. ""We're going to do something. And one of the things we're going to do is expedite. When somebody is terrific, we want them back here. They have to be legally."" Bash asked if they have to leave. ""They're with their parents. It depends. But look, it sounds cold, and it sounds hard,"" Trump said. ""We have a country. Our country is going to hell. We have to have a system where people are legally in our country."" A Priorities spokesperson noted other media reports saying Trump would deport all immigrants in the country illegally, including Dreamers, that he would rescind Obama’s deferred action programs, and that undocumented immigrants seeking relief from Obama’s executive actions ""could expose themselves to Trump’s mass deportation plan."" Hypothetically, Trump could revoke the deferred action status of DACA recipients, which in turn would terminate their employment authorization and render them subject to removal, said Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, an immigration law expert and professor at Pennsylvania State University. ""However the biggest impediment to deporting this cohort of immigrants would be the resources it would take to apprehend, detain, charge, try and remove so-called Dreamers,"" Wadhia said. ""If he wanted to, he could target the vast majority of Dreamers for removal but it would not be easy or quick — it would likely take years to implement."" Our ruling A Priorities USA Action ad said, ""Trump wants to deport millions, even our Dreamers."" Trump has made clear he would deport millions. More recently in the campaign, Trump said he would set priorities, starting with at least 2 million ""criminal aliens."" He has given mixed messages on the timeline of deportations for people who don’t pose safety threats. Trump has also said he would terminate Obama administration programs that defer deportation for undocumented people who arrived in the United States as children. If that happens, Dreamers may be subject to deportation. In interviews, Trump has been slightly more sympathetic to this group, calling their situation ""tough."" At the same time, he has consistently said all immigrants here illegally will have to go, but ""terrific"" ones could have their return expedited.

Stefanik ad takes Derrick's comments out of context
","A television ad from U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Willsboro, charges her Democratic opponent doesn’t know enough about the North Country to represent the 21st Congressional District. The ad, which began airing in early October, portrays Mike Derrick as out of touch with the region. A narrator in the ad says, ""When asked about bills in Congress important to the North Country, Derrick responded, ‘I just don’t know enough about it.’ Elise Stefanik does."" The narrator then highlights Stefanik’s positions on a handful of issues important to the district. Derrick, a native of the Clinton County, attended schools in the town of Peru and Plattsburgh  before embarking on his Army career. The West Point graduate served for 28 years in both the active and reserve forces, retiring in 2013 and then moving back to the region.   He’s challenging Stefanik, a first-term member of Congress who previously worked in the White House under President George W. Bush and also led debate preparation for Paul Ryan when he ran for vice president in 2012. Is Stefanik’s ad right? Did Derrick say he didn’t know enough about legislation important to the North Country to take a position? When did he say that? We read the article Stefanik’s campaign quotes in the ad. It was published more than a year ago on the website of the Post-Star newspaper in Glens Falls. Derrick was participating in a discussion held by the Glens Falls chapter of Democracy for America, a progressive grassroots political organization led by Jim Dean and his brother, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean. Derrick was asked about his position on single-payer health care at the October 2015 event. In a single-payer system, one entity handles health care claims and costs for customers instead of multiple insurance companies. Proponents say it would guarantee health care for people who may now lack it, while opponents believe such a system would drive up taxes and limit access to adequate care. Derrick did not take a position on single-payer health care at the time. ""Whether or not we should move to a single-payer program in this country right now, I’m not ready to come out on that yet. I just don’t know enough about it,"" Derrick said, according to the article. Derrick’s views on health care A year after the event, Derrick’s position has evolved. Derrick, who supports the Affordable Care Act, believes Congress could build on the current health care system to create a single-payer system. ""When my wife, Kathy, and I served in the military, we had access to health care through the TRICARE system. For us and so many other men and women in uniform, it was incredibly successful and effective,"" Derrick said. ""I believe that we can use that as a model to build a single-payer health care system for all Americans. With a uniquely American single-payer health care system, we can finally ensure that everyone has access to the health care that they and their family need. This is what we should be working toward."" He also said in an article in North Country Now that moving in the direction of a single-payer health care system similar to what the military uses would eventually drive down costs for consumers. Our ruling Stefanik began airing an ad in October accusing Derrick of not knowing enough about the issues that affect the North Country. The narrator in the ad says, ""When asked about bills in Congress important to the North Country, Derrick responded, ‘I just don’t know enough about it.’ "" Derrick said that about a particular kind of health care coverage - not other issues in the North Country.  We rate this claim as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D17980>],/factchecks/2016/nov/01/elise-stefanik/stefanik-ad-takes-derricks-comments-out-context/

Austin Realtors group incorrect saying Gerald Daugherty endorsed by Austin American-Statesman
","Republican Gerald Daugherty, seeking re-election to the Travis County commissioners court, is ""endorsed by"" Austin’s daily newspaper, an advocacy group told select members. Hold that pony. The Austin American-Statesman, which is headquarters for PolitiFact Texas, announced in May 2016 its editorial board wouldn’t be endorsing candidates going forward. So we were curious when a reader asked us to check the Daugherty endorsement claim spotted in an Austin Board of Realtors PAC mailer. Separately, we fielded a copy of the mailer from Jonathan Panzer, campaign manager for David Holmes, a mediator and the Democratic nominee facing Daugherty, a businessman, to represent the county’s Precinct 3. To be sure, Daugherty was endorsed by the newspaper in early 2016. That February, the American-Statesman editorial board urged readers to favor Daugherty over Jason Nassour in the March 2016 Republican primary. ""Republicans should stick with the incumbent,"" that editorial said after calling Daugherty ""an important compass for the commissioners court on matters of fiscal responsibility"" who ""has shown an ability to prod his predictably blue colleagues to the right despite his minority status."" But in May 2016, American-Statesman editors announced the newspaper would no longer endorse candidates for office--and that announcement was followed by the paper making no candidate endorsements leading up to the November 2016 general election. In a May 21, 2016, article describing changes in the paper's opinion pages, editors said: ""Perhaps the most significant philosophical change as we adjust resources is that we will no longer endorse political candidates, although we will weigh in as necessary on ballot measures and other issues."" That article, by the paper’s editor, Debbie Hiott, and Viewpoints editor, Tara Trower Doolittle, went on: ""The sheer number of candidates in a metropolitan area this size and the number of editorial writers we have makes it challenging to add to the contours of the electoral debate. In the last"" Austin City Council ""cycle, our board met with more than 120 political candidates. In the most recent primary season, we held more than two dozen meetings and we declined to endorse in a number of statewide and county races in our readership area. We also have been increasingly forced to not endorse in races where candidates have chosen to skip the interview process altogether."" So, we wondered how the Realtors group concluded Daugherty had snagged the paper's general-election backing. By phone and email, an ABOR representative, Emily Chenevert, said the mailer--sent independently and not in coordination with Daugherty, she said--was incorrect and 3,000 recipients, among the group’s more than 11,000 members, would receive a corrective email. Chenevert further told us that ""we made the mistake of not clarifying that Commissioner Daugherty was endorsed by the Statesman in the primary. We recognize that no endorsement was made by the Statesman for the general election."" Earlier the same day, we confirmed that Daugherty’s campaign website said he was endorsed by the American-Statesman, an element brought to our attention by the reader: SOURCE: Gerald Daugherty’s campaign website (screen grab, Oct. 31, 2016) To our queries about that, Daugherty noted by phone that he had been endorsed by the newspaper before the primary. Since then, he said, he’s guilty of not changing the pre-primary endorsement mention on his site. ""I probably should have gone in there and said ‘in the primary,’"" Daugherty said. The same day, he called back to say his site had since been amended to say he was ""endorsed in the March Republican primary only,"" a change we confirmed. Generally too, we asked Hiott to weigh in on anyone touting pre-primary endorsements in the context of the 2016 general elections. She replied by email: ""Every candidate knows that an endorsement is made within the context of a particular race and particular opponents. To then present it as an endorsement in another race is disingenuous at best."" Our ruling ABOR’s mailer says Daugherty is endorsed by the American-Statesman. The newspaper did not endorse Daugherty or any candidate before the November 2016 general election after editors earlier announced the paper wouldn’t endorse candidates going forward.

Michelle Mosby on soft ground about Joe Morrissey's law-writing record
","Richmond City Council President Michelle Mosby pulled no punches in a recent radio ad that took aim at Joe Morrissey, one of her opponents in the city’s mayoral race. ""Joe has been a delegate in the General Assembly for eight years with no laws passed to help our black community with education or workforce,"" Mosby said in the 60-second clip that started running in early October. The ad began airing with polls showing Morrissey drawing substantial support from the black community. Mosby warns voters, ""Don’t trust him."" Mosby told us back-up information for her claim about Morrissey’s General Assembly record can be found on the state’s Legislative Information System, which tracks measures that lawmakers write and pass every year. So we took a look. Morrissey served in the House from 2008 to 2015. We found a dozen bills that were signed into law for which Morrissey was listed either as the patron or chief co-patron. But almost all fell outside of Mosby’s specification regarding laws ""to help our black community with education or workforce."" The lone exception we found was a 2009 law Morrissey wrote that required colleges, in the middle of a semester, to give full course credit to students who are deployed on active military duty. We asked Morrissey for his take on Mosby’s statement, and he sent us a letter pointing to 26 laws that he said ""had some connectivity to either education or workforce."" Only three of the laws Morrissey cited were measures where he was chief patron: • The 2009 military academic credit law mentioned above. • A 2008 law to allow people who had their driver's license suspended for failure to pay fines to get a restricted driving permit if they showed there was a good reason they didn't pay their parking tickets. Morrissey's legislation was rolled into a similar bill sponsored by then-Del. Rosalyn Dance, D-Petersburg, that was signed into law. • A 2009 law that established guidelines for state investigations of licensed health professionals.  Of the 26 laws Morrissey cited, the other 23 were measures he co-sponsored. Sometimes he was one of a few delegates backing a bill, but often he was among dozens of fellow lawmakers who supported a bill. Sometimes the connection between the statutes to which Morrissey points and the categories Mosby cites is tenuous. But we did find some that could fall into the broad categories of education and workforce issues: • Morrissey was one of 21 legislators who co-sponsored a 2010 law establishing virtual schools that allow public school students to take classes online. • In 2013, Morrissey was one of 26 co-sponsors of a law that established guidelines for school districts to tackle bullying. • In 2008, Morrissey was among 37 co-sponsors of a law authorizing $350 million in bonds for construction projects at colleges. In 2009, he was among nine sponsors of a law to establish guidelines for teaching financial literacy to K-12 students. Our ruling Mosby said ""Joe (Morrissey) has been a delegate in the General Assembly for eight years with no laws passed to help our black community with education or workforce."" A review of Morrissey’s record shows he was not a prolific writer of laws that helped the black community in those two categories. But we don’t come up empty. Morrissey introduced a bill - which became a law under another legislator’s name - that allows people who can’t afford to pay traffic fines to keep driving. That will help some people - black and white - get to work. Morrissey wrote a law that requires colleges to give credit to students who are deployed by the military during mid-semester. That will help some people - black and white - complete college. So Mosby’s statement has some basis but also overlooks some of Morrissey’s broad legislative accomplishments. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978ADBC0>],/factchecks/2016/nov/01/michelle-mosby/michelle-mosby-soft-ground-about-joe-morrisseys-la/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump's claim about weak economic growth under President Obama doesn't tell the full story
","Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump switched over the weekend from lambasting Hillary Clinton’s email policies to criticizing how President Barack Obama has handled the economy. ""Obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth,"" Trump said during an Oct. 28 campaign rally in Manchester, N.H. We decided to look back at the economic data and found that Trump was right, as long as you're looking at the economic statistics a specific way. ABCs of GDP The Trump campaign didn’t respond to our requests for more specifics, but we can make a couple of assumptions. When Trump talked of growth, he likely meant the percent change in gross domestic product, called GDP, which is the total value of goods and services in the country. The time frame he’s using is indistinct, but ""a single year"" probably relates to the annual change in GDP. Looking at the economic statistics under those guidelines, Trump would be correct. But the comparison he's making about Obama provides a narrow view of the economy. ""I suppose he’s using year-over-year data, with which the claim is true but misleading,"" Princeton economist Alan Blinder told PolitiFact Florida. Blinder and another Princeton economics professor, David Watson, examined GDP growth during presidential administrations in a July 2014 study. There are any number of historical vagaries that color what affects GDP during any administration, Obama included. Obama has overseen the country climbing out of a historical recession that left the housing market depressed, wages low, and businesses wary of investing. He’s also had a Congress that has largely pushed an austerity agenda against his wishes. And global crises like instability in the Middle East and slowed growth in China and Europe have lowered demand for U.S. products and pushed the dollar higher. ""The fact that the economy has steadily improved is actually fairly remarkable, considering what else has been happening,"" said Christian Weller, a University of Massachusetts Boston public policy professor and a fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Annual figures on GDP growth goes back to 1929, and often is used to back up the same talking point on conservative media outlets that Obama has not had a full calendar year of aggregate GDP growth of at least 3 percent. U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data shows Herbert Hoover, who was inaugurated in March 1929 and left office in March 1933, was the last president to have this distinction. Hoover presided over an economy mired in the Great Depression that shrank during his term. Every president since then has seen at least one calendar year with annual GDP growth of at least 3 percent or higher. The best average growth in a single calendar year under Obama is 2.6 percent in 2015, and never 3 percent or more. No president has experienced that since Hoover. But experts said Trump’s use of ""modern history"" is vague, and using the annual change in GDP is perhaps not the best measure. The best data goes back to 1947, when the federal government started tracking GDP by quarter. That would give a more nuanced picture of the data — the economy in the first quarter of a presidency is often attributed to the preceding administration, for example. It also would coincide with the historical boom in the nation’s economy after World War II. Going by quarters, growth within a year was higher than 3 percent during two periods during Obama’s presidency, Blinder said. Between the third quarters of 2009 and 2010, GDP growth was 3.4 percent. From the first quarters of 2014 and of 2015, it was 3.3 percent. Overall growth rates for several administrations have exceeded 3 percent, but Weller said context is important. Without complete data for 2016, the average growth rate during Obama’s two terms was 2 percent, Weller said. That was on par with George H.W. Bush’s term and faster than George W. Bush’s average. Our ruling Trump said, ""Obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth."" Although Trump’s light on specifics, that’s accurate if he is looking solely at year-over-year figures for GDP growth going back to the Hoover administration. Experts told us that presenting the stats the way Trump did doesn't tell the whole story. And if we examine the data annually by quarters, Obama has presided over periods of growth topping 3 percent. We rate the statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c46d6ec9-ea86-45ce-8245-091394df52e0

Claim that George Soros owns U.S. voting machines is Pants on Fire!
","How do you spread a rumor without taking responsibility for spreading it? By saying you don’t vouch for its accuracy — yet. That’s what Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., did on CNN on the topic of vote rigging. In an interview on the Situation Room, Duffy said he didn’t have evidence of ""widespread problems across the country,"" but he went out of his way to relay some troubling reports. ""Articles that I have read, I haven't verified them,"" Duffy told host Wolf Blitzer on Oct. 27, 2016. ""But we heard that one of George Soros' companies has provided some of the machines for some of these states. And, obviously, Mr. Soros leans left. I haven't personally verified that yet."" Duffy’s comment is notable because the claim had been debunked a week before he appeared on CNN by Snopes, and again three days before by the Washington Post. The claim about billionaire Soros emerged on several conservative websites. One Daily Caller report said, ""Smartmatic, a U.K.-based voting technology company with deep ties to George Soros, has provided voting technology in 16 states including battleground zones like Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia."" The article noted that Smartmatic stated on its website that it ""will not be deploying its technology in any U.S. county for the upcoming 2016 U.S. presidential elections."" That nuance was lost on many people. More than 125,000 signed a petition posted  Oct. 21, 2016, on the White House website that said, ""We the people ask Congress to meet in emergency session about removing George Soros-owned voting machines from 16 states."" To be clear, abundant evidence shows that Soros owns no voting machines in the United States. To go further, the link between Soros and Smartmatic is gossamer thin. Company CEO Antonio Mugica and chairman Lord Mark Malloch-Brown said in a statement, ""George Soros has zero ownership or involvement in our company. Smartmatic has no ties to political parties or groups in any country and it abides by a strict code of ethics that forbids the company from donating to any political campaigns of any kind."" The one connection between Soros and Malloch-Brown is that Malloch-Brown sits on the global board of Soros’ Open Society Foundations. Malloch-Brown is a former minister of State in the British cabinet and, as the Smartmatic website stated, he is a member of ""a number of non-profit boards addressing global issues from poverty reduction to conflict resolution."" On top of all this, no state is using Smartmatic machines in this election. The Verified Voting Foundation, a group founded by a Stanford computer scientist to promote accuracy in voting, tracks all companies that provide voting equipment in the United States. Smartmatic has no such equipment in any state. (Hat-tip to Snopes, the internet rumor-zapping website that first dug into this.) The Utah Republican Party used a Smartmatic system in the 2016 primary, and Los Angeles County tested one element for provisional and mail-in ballots. All of this information was available before Duffy’s interview. (In addition to Snopes and the Washington Post, investigative journalism website ProPublica also debunked the idea.) Duffy’s communications director Mark Bednar said, ""Congressman Duffy didn't claim anything in particular and merely spoke about what people have been recently discussing throughout the nation."" Our ruling Duffy said that there were unverified reports that a George Soros company was providing voting machines in certain states. In the week before Duffy said that, those reports had been fully discredited three times. Soros owns no company that offers voting machines, and the company named in the rumor has no voting machines in the United States. To call a baseless rumor ""unverified"" after it has been thoroughly debunked twists the meaning of the word. We rate this claim Pants On Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/74ea2227-cd2b-4e4b-9f20-8f2af7d27807",[<zip object at 0x000002809C22ADC0>],/factchecks/2016/oct/31/sean-duffy/wisconsin-congressman-fuels-soros-voting-machine-r/

Clinton exaggerates Trump's campaign strategy on curbing voter turnout
","With a little more than a week until Election Day, Hillary Clinton attacked what she called Donald Trump’s strategy to keep groups of people away from the polls come Nov. 8. ""Donald Trump's strategy is real simple,"" Clinton told a crowd Oct. 29 in Daytona Beach, Fla. ""They have even said in his campaign it's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home, too."" Has Trump’s campaign really said that? It turns out Clinton is referring to news articles that quote anonymous Trump advisers who say the campaign's strategy is to keep Clinton supporters home on Election Day by ratcheting up her negatives. Suppression? More like voter depression Clinton’s campaign pointed to news reports that quote anonymous Trump officials. The first example is a Bloomberg Businessweek article from Oct. 27 that takes readers behind the scenes of Trump’s marketing operations. The article quotes a senior Trump campaign official saying that the campaign has ""three major voter suppression operations under way."" The article doesn’t offer any more details about the source other than the fact the person was a ""senior official."" According to the Bloomberg story, the suppression operations are targeting white liberals, young women and African Americans through radio spots, social media and targeting specific neighborhoods. What specifically is Trump telling those groups? Clinton’s 1996 remark where she suggests some African-American males are ""super predators"" is being used in social media posts aimed at discouraging African-Americans from voting. The group of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and degraded by Hillary Clinton are meant to dismantle young women’s positive views of Clinton and so on. This isn’t the only article that quotes an unidentified Trump adviser making a similar claim. Trump’s ""advisers"" told the Wall Street Journal the campaign is trying to ""depress Democratic voter turnout."" After news broke of Trump’s 2005 lewd comments about sexual assault and women, the Trump campaign implemented a ""scorched earth strategy"" to keep voters home on Nov. 8, the Wall Street Journal reported. Just like what was reported in the Bloomberg article, Trump advisers told the Wall Street Journal that Trump was looking to use the attacks over Clinton’s email server and allegations about her husband to keep Clinton supporters home on election day. There’s also a Yahoo News article with a similar story from another unidentified source. Caveats There are caveats that come with Clinton’s claim. First, we can’t independently verify if Trump officials said these things. Trump, himself, has said not to trust articles that don’t name specific sources. Remember, don't believe ""sources said"" by the VERY dishonest media. If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist. Also, publicly, Trump has gone to great lengths to court women and African-American voters.  He has called for six weeks of mandatory paid maternity leave and tax credits for child care. And he has tried to attract African-Americans by touting his business plan, saying the Clinton and Democrats have failed. ""What the hell do you have to lose?"" said Trump, asking for black voters' support. Further, experts say what the media reports are describing are not all that shocking or atypical. In some ways, Clinton is describing modern-day politics warts and all. Tobe Berkovitz, an associate professor of advertising at Boston University, who has worked as a political media consultant for presidential campaigns, said it’s likely that Trump’s campaign is trying to curb Clinton voters with negative campaigning. He said this is not unusual because modern politics based in negativity is an inherent part of campaigns, adding that negative campaigning ""discourages the hell out of all voters."" If you look at Trump’s strategy as negative campaigning, then it seems that Trump is not trying to suppress voters, but depress them. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple. They have even said in his campaign it's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home, too."" That’s leaving a lot of details out. Trump never literally told women, young people, people of color and ""intelligent men,"" to stay home on Nov. 8. Clinton’s remark refers to news articles that quote anonymous sources from the campaign saying the strategy is to reduce turnout for Clinton by targeting specific groups of people, including young people, women and people of color. Yet Trump himself has tried to woo women and African-Americans on the campaign trail and said anonymous-sourced stories from his campaign should not be trusted. Lastly, experts say what Clinton is describing is a fairly typical type of negative campaigning. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate.

Trump mistakes exhibition hall for abandoned factory
","At a rally outside Cleveland, Donald Trump tried to tie his dire message about an outsourcing economy to the venue at which he appeared. ""I want to thank Patrick Park and Ray Park, they own this building,"" Trump said in his introduction on Oct. 22 at the I-X Center, an exhibition hall near Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in Brook Park, Ohio. ""They do such a great job, it’s incredible and it’s an honor."" He professed fondness for Cleveland, and said, ""In 17 days we are going to win the great state of Ohio, and we are going to win the White House. Together we’re going to deliver real change that once again puts America first."" Trump continued, ""As an example, this used to be a great plant. Thousands and thousands of people worked here, and they left. So many people are leaving, so many people are closing their businesses and moving to Mexico and other countries. Not going to happen anymore, we’re going to tell you why, but not going to happen anymore."" We wanted to know whether one of the prime convention sites for Northeast Ohio was formerly a hoppin’ manufacturing plant. Here’s what history told us. The I-X Center was originally built in 1942 for the U.S. Defense Department during World War II, according to Case Western Reserve University’s Encyclopedia of Cleveland History. It became known as the Cleveland Tank Plant or the Cleveland Bomber plant, and under General Motors it employed 15,000 people who built parts for the B-29 bomber. The plant closed when the war ended, and the city of Cleveland retained it as an exhibition hall and sales center before leasing it to National Terminals for the storage of soybeans. The facility resumed wartime service in 1950, when GM’s Cadillac Division chose it as the manufacturing site for Army tanks destined for battle in Korea. GM immediately employed 6,000 workers, but after two years of production, the Army rejected the Cadillac Tank Plant’s output due to a problem with the gun mechanism. After a redesign of the gun sight, the plant produced Walker Bulldog tanks used in the Korean war between 1953 and 1955. Production ceased on the Walker Bulldogs in 1959. Cadillac won a new military contract in 1960 to build the self-propelled T195 and T196 howitzer tanks and M114 armored personnel carriers.  In 1965, GM shifted the management of the Cleveland Tank Plant to its Allison Division. It made M551 16-ton Sheridan tanks up to 1972, when the contract was completed and Congress decided against its renewal. The U.S. Defense Department sold the plant to the Park Corporation of Charleston, W.Va., in 1977, which opened it in 1985 as the I-X Center, calling it the ""largest single-building exhibition facility in the world."" Now, it appears to be the United States’ ninth-largest. Nowhere in the building’s history does it appear that manufacturing was transferred overseas. Military contracts kept the site active for its first 30 years, interrupted by a period in which it stored soybeans. In 1985 it became an exhibition hall, the function it serves today. About an hour after this fact-check was published, the Trump campaign responded in disagreement with our findings. ""Mr. Trump used the history of the I-X center as a great manufacturing facility as an introduction to his hour long speech where he talked about issues impacting jobs in Northeast Ohio, and PolitiFact does its readers and its brand a disservice by running such misleading headlines and false ratings,"" said Seth Unger, the Trump campaign's Ohio spokesman.  Our ruling Trump said that Cleveland’s I-X center was an example of a once-great plant, but ""thousands and thousands of people worked here, and they left. So many people are leaving, so many people are closing their businesses and moving to Mexico and other countries."" Trump’s lamentation of outsourcing isn’t historically accurate. The I-X Center was alternately called the Cleveland Tank Plant, and GM’s Cadillac and Allison Divisions built military bombers, tanks and personnel carriers there between 1942 and 1972. Production stopped when a military contract expired and was not renewed. Once acquired by the Park Corporation, it opened as an exhibition space in 1985 and has operated as one ever since. We rate Trump’s statement False. Editor's note: This fact-check was updated shortly after publication to include the Trump campaign's response. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3b6973bb-4d55-4b41-9d84-92394ece37b9",[<zip object at 0x00000280974ABD40>],/factchecks/2016/oct/31/donald-trump/trump-mistakes-exhibition-hall-abandoned-factory/

Pants on Fire! Trump says Clinton would let 650 million people into the U.S., in one week
","One of Donald Trump’s signature lines at campaign rallies are his promise to secure the border in contrast with Hillary Clinton’s ""open borders."" ""She wants open borders. We could have 600 million people pour into our country. Think of it. Once you have open borders like that, you don’t have a country anymore,"" Trump said in Greeley, Colo., on Oct. 30, according to CBS News. By the time Trump spoke in Albuquerque, the number had jumped to 650 million people. And Trump said it would happen ""in one week."" ""She wants to let people just pour in. You could have 650 million people pour in, and we do nothing about it. Think of it. That’s what could happen. You triple the size of our country in one week,"" Trump said. Both claims are ridiculous and should be discarded immediately. Some numbers, for context The worldwide population is about 7.3 billion people, and the United States is home to about 324 million. The U.S. immigrant population in 2014 was more than 42.4 million, or 13.3 percent of the nation’s total population, according to Migration Policy Institute estimates using Census Bureau data. That represents millions of people who have migrated to the United States over decades. There are about 1 million daily legal crossings between the United States and Mexico -- that’s a count of people going back and forth into each country. Mexicans represent the single largest share of the U.S. total migrant population, about 27 percent in 2015, according to Migration Policy Institute. Yet, more Mexicans have left the United States than have come in since the end of the Great Recession, according to Pew Research Center. To get close to Trump's 650 million migration, every single person from South America, Central America and Canada would have to move to the United States (about 633 million people), the Washington Post noted. To do it, as Trump said, in one week, 3.87 million people would have to enter the country every hour for 168 straight hours. That's equivalent to the entire population of the city of Los Angeles entering the country every hour for a full week. Clinton’s immigration stance While Trump's claim is logistically impossible, it's also in no way what Clinton proposes. We asked Trump’s campaign where the candidate was drawing his information from and they circled back to their claim that Clinton is for open borders, something we've rated False or Mostly False depending on the particulars of what Trump said. The Clinton campaign said she did not support allowing 650 million people into the country. ""This is just demonstrably false,"" said Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Clinton’s campaign. So what is Clinton’s policy? At campaign events, presidential debates, press conferences and on the immigration reform page on Clinton’s campaign website, there has been no mention of Clinton wanting millions of people to pour into the United States, much less in a week. She has not called for open borders. In September 2015, Clinton said in a CBS’ Face the Nation interview the United States should accept 65,000 Syrian refugees afflicted by that country’s civil war. ""We're facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II and I think the United States has to do more,"" Clinton said. She has stressed a need for thorough refugee vetting. Based on Clinton’s September 2015 comment, Trump recently made the False assertion that Clinton would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term. Clinton has not said that, and Trump’s statement was based on assumptions. Clinton does support increasing immigration for high-skilled workers and entrepreneurs. But there's been no reference to millions of people migrating to the United States. Finally, the Democratic presidential nominee has widely spoken about offering a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally and to introduce comprehensive immigration reform within her first 100 days in office. Clinton has said she would focus on deporting those who pose a violent threat to public safety. In 2013, Clinton supported legislation (which never passed) that included a path to citizenship, billions for border security, fencing along the Mexican border and adding 20,000 border agents. Our ruling Trump said Clinton ""wants to let people just pour in. You could have 650 million people pour in, and we do nothing about it. Think of it. That’s what could happen. You triple the size of our country in one week."" Clinton has never said that, nor is this a realistic possibility. Clinton has spoken in favor of bring in 65,000 Syrian refugees, but that’s nowhere near hundreds of millions of people, and not in a week. Trump’s claim is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
