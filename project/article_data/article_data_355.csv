Does the U.S. have the highest percentage of people in prison?
","
A Georgia congressman recently penned a letter to an American legend that sparked some conversation among the PolitiFact Georgia staff.

U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, a Democrat who lives in DeKalb County, decried the large number of Americans incarcerated, among other things, in a message to Frederick Douglass, the famed 19th-century abolitionist, author and activist. The letter was written to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, written by President Abraham Lincoln to end slavery. 

""[W]e see America's prison population exploding, with America having a greater percentage of its people behind bars than any other nation in the world!"" wrote Johnson, a former magistrate court judge.

PolitiFact Georgia examined a similar claim by Johnson before. The congressman claimed last year that the United States imprisons more than any nation in the world. PolitiFact Georgia found Johnson was likely correct that the U.S. has more people behind bars than any other country, but America does have one of the largest populations in the world, so it’s not entirely an apples-to-apples comparison. Our research showed there are probably some nations with a higher percentage of people in prison, so we rated Johnson’s claim Half True.

We were slightly surprised by this claim floating around again. We wondered whether there was anything new to consider on this issue since we fact-checked it in May. This time, Johnson was talking about the percentage of people in jail, not the total prison population as he did last year. We decided to take a look.

Last year, the estimates we found all said there were about 2.3 million people in U.S. prisons. That’s about 730 people in prison for every 100,000 Americans. The estimate remained about the same.

The International Centre for Prison Studies, based at the University of Essex in Great Britain, keeps the most detailed information about prison populations worldwide. Its World Prison Population List is widely used in studies and by reporters.

In the report we reviewed last year, the U.S. had the highest percentage of its citizens in prison among nations where the ICPS could verify such information. Russia and Rwanda ranked second and third, respectively. Both countries were well behind the United States. Russia had 598 people in its prisons per 100,000 citizens.

As for China, the most recent ICPS report states that nation has at least 1.6 million people in its prisons. The number may be as much as 2.3 million if you include an estimated 650,000 held in detention centers. Using the larger estimate, that would be 170 people per 100,000 Chinese citizens, which is far lower than the U.S.

At the time, we found it was possible that there were two other countries that put a greater percentage of people in prison: Cuba and North Korea. Has that changed?

First, let’s look at Cuba. A 2003 study reported in The Miami Herald found an estimated 100,000 inmates in 200 prisons and labor camps spread across the Caribbean island. Several prominent human rights organizations did not dispute the figure. In 1995, the United Nations estimated there were ""between 100,000 and 200,000 prisoners in all categories,'' the Herald reported.
    
""If accurate, the figure of 100,000 inmates in an island of nearly 11.3 million people would give Cuba 888 inmates per 100,000 people, far ahead of the United States,"" the Herald article said.

Johnson’s office sent us information that suggests the number of prisoners on the island may be much lower. The most recent ICPS report shows the prison population was 510 people per 100,000 residents as of May.

In May 2011, Amnesty International compiled a report on North Korea and concluded there were an estimated 200,000 people being held in political prisoner camps. The estimate was based on satellite images and eyewitness accounts. That equates to 813 per 100,000, higher than the U.S. The ICPS has similar totals for North Korea, citing the South Korean National Human Rights Commission. North Korea’s total cannot be independently verified.

""Otherwise, without any firm, recent, quantified statistics involving North Korean figures, it is very difficult to evaluate whether the statement that they have higher incarceration rates is accurate,"" said Andy Phelan, a spokesman for Johnson. ""It is, however, entirely accurate to state that the United States has the highest reported incarceration rate, as well as the highest total prison population, based on the most recent studies."" 

The United States has the highest percentage of people in its prisons of any nation that can be verified. From the most recent numbers we’ve seen, the U.S. may have a higher percentage than one nation (Cuba) we thought had more of its people in prison. 

We’ll give Johnson a higher grade this time on the Truth-O-Meter but still leave room for another country (North Korea, perhaps) that may have a higher percentage of its people in prison. Our rating: Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/jan/14/hank-johnson/does-us-have-highest-percentage-people-prison/

Since '94 law, domestic violence down two-thirds in U.S., Democratic Rep. Gwen Moore says
","
Domestic violence is so common that one in four women and one in seven men ""have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner,"" according to a national survey done by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
So, could it also be true that incidents of domestic violence have fallen dramatically? 
On Dec. 11, 2012, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., and 119 other members of Congress signed a letter calling on House leaders to hold a vote on re-authorizing the Violence Against Women Act. 
Moore was among the lead writers of the letter, which declared that since the federal law was adopted in 1994, ""cases of domestic violence have fallen by 67 percent."" 
Nearly two decades have passed, but a two-thirds drop is sizable. 
Is Moore correct on the number? And, if so, to what extent is the law responsible for the decline? 
The law and the numbers 
The Violence Against Women Act gives money to state and local law enforcement entities to investigate and prosecute violent crimes against women. After the law’s adoption in 1994, Congress re-authorized it in 2000 and 2005, but failed to do so before its session ended in December 2012. Supporters of reauthorization hope to take up the matter again in 2013, possibly as early as January, said Moore spokeswoman Nicole Williams. 
Moore, of Milwaukee, is a longtime advocate for domestic violence victims. In December 2010, we rated as True her statement that in Wisconsin, ""deaths from domestic violence"" were ""at the highest in 10 years."" 
In the latest attempt to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, versions of the 67 percent decrease claim were also made by others: the White House, in a fact sheet; the left-leaning MoveOn.org political advocacy group, in a TV ad; and a U.S. Justice Department official, in testimony to Congress. 
When we asked Moore’s spokeswoman for evidence to back the figure, Williams cited a Justice Department report from September 2011. 
But we found a more recent report from the department, issued in November 2012, two weeks before Moore’s letter. Williams said ""we are now transitioning to using"" the figures in that report. 
The new report was based on ""nonfatal victimizations reported and not reported to the police"" against persons age 12 or older from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households. 
The first finding in the report: from 1994 to 2010, the rate of nonfatal intimate-partner violence in the U.S. declined by 64 percent. The rate dropped from 9.8 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older to 3.6 per 1,000. 
Intimate partner violence was defined to include rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend. 
The 64 percent figure is nearly as high as the 67 percent decrease Moore claimed. 
But Moore mentioned the Violence Against Women Act and the decrease in the same breath, not saying one caused the other, but suggesting there was a strong connection. So let’s see what role the law played in reducing domestic violence. 
Why are numbers declining? 
The Violence Against Women Act contains provisions that could lead to a reduction in domestic violence -- through raising awareness of the offense as a crime, locking up violators and deterring potential offenders.
According to a May 2012 report by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, the law provides grants to, among other things: 
The National Network to End Domestic Violence, which is pushing for reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, credits the law for declines in domestic violence. 
And a 2002 University of North Carolina study estimated that the law had saved billions of dollars in social costs by reducing incidents of domestic violence. 
But it’s also clear that other factors bear on the decline. 
Carnegie Mellon University researchers in 2003 concluded that three other factors were key in declines in domestic violence incidents between 1993 and 1998 -- an increase in legal services for victims; improvement in women’s economic status; and the aging of the population. 
Barbara Paradiso, director of the Center on Domestic Violence at the University of Colorado Denver, told us that the Violence Against Women Act is one reason for the decline in domestic violence. But experts debate over what factors are most responsible, she said. 
Our rating 
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore said that since the Violence Against Women Act was adopted in 1994, ""cases of domestic violence have fallen by 67 percent."" 
Her statement is generally on the money, though a bit dated. It also needs some clarification -- namely that there are factors in addition to the law that are linked to the decrease.

"['New Jersey', 'Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Bill Pascrell']","
Rep. Bill Pascrell says federal revenues, as a share of the economy, are lowest in 40-50 years
","
The day before voting in favor of raising taxes on higher-income Americans as part of a deal averting the so-called ""fiscal cliff,"" one North Jersey congressman argued that the amount of dollars reaching federal coffers has reached a historic low.

As the nation braced for a series of automatic spending cuts and tax increases, Rep. Bill Pascell (D-9th Dist.) claimed in a Dec. 31 radio interview that, as a share of the economy, federal revenues are at their lowest level in up to a half century.

""How much money the government is collecting from people...in terms of the gross domestic product"" is ""the lowest in 40, 50 years,"" Pascrell said on WOR-AM.

It’s actually been even longer than Pascrell claimed.

As a share of the gross domestic product, or GDP, federal revenues in recent years have been at their lowest level in roughly 60 years, according to data from U.S. Department of the Treasury and the White House’s Office of Management and Budget.

In fiscal year 2012, which ended in September, federal revenues were 15.7 percent of GDP, slightly higher than the 15.4 percent in fiscal year 2011 and the 15.1 percent in both fiscal years 2009 and 2010.

The last time when federal revenues were lower than those amounts occurred in fiscal year 1950, when revenues were 14.4 percent of GDP. Between fiscal years 1951 and 2008, the ratio of federal revenues to GDP ranged from 16.1 percent to 20.6 percent.

Alan Auerbach, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told us the lower ratio in recent years is due, in part, to the fact that incomes and thus tax collections dropped during the recession.

Another contributing factor is the tax cuts provided over the last decade, including the lower income tax rates first approved by President George W. Bush, according to Auerbach.

""Taxes as a share of GDP tend to be ‘procyclical,’ meaning that the tax/GDP ratio rises during expansions and falls during recessions,"" Auerbach said in an e-mail. ""That’s due to the progressivity of the income tax (increases in income are taxed at higher rates) and the volatility of corporate profits.""

""In addition to the Bush tax cuts, which also reduced revenues, we had measures adopted during the recession, notably the payroll tax cut that just expired,"" Auerbach added.

In response to our findings, Pascrell spokesman Thomas Pietrykoski said in an e-mail:

""What is clear as day is that the Bush Tax cuts took a hatchet to government revenue, significantly contributing to our current debt problems. Congressman Pascrell is supportive of a balanced approach in resolving the current fiscal situation that both cuts spending and asks the wealthiest among us to pay their fair share to reduce our deficit.""

Our ruling

In a radio interview, Pascrell said ""how much money the government is collecting from people...in terms of the gross domestic product"" is ""the lowest in 40, 50 years.""

The congressman’s point is solid, but his timing is slightly off.

As a share of the economy, federal revenues in recent years have been at their lowest level in roughly 60 years. Starting in fiscal year 2009, revenues have remained below 16 percent of GDP, the lowest point since they hit 14.4 percent in fiscal year 1950.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

Rhode Island Sen. Dawson Hodgson says the state spends nearly as much on its legislature as it does on University of Rhode Island
","
Supporters of the University of Rhode Island complain that it doesn't get enough state funding, particularly amid calls for a better educated, more competitive state work force. State financing per URI student has fallen by an inflation-adjusted 47 percent since 2002, one national report said last year.

State Sen. Dawson T. Hodgson, R-North Kingstown, raised the issue in a Jan. 3, 2012, radio interview on WPRO-AM.

Hodgson talked about the state budget as more than a financial document, but, rather, as a statement of values and priorities.

In that vein, he noted, ""the amount of money that we put into running our own state legislature is nearly as much as we put into the University of Rhode Island.""

We hit the books to see whether the legislature-URI comparison passes the test.

We called Hodgson, who said he would supply figu res the next day. In the meantime, we checked with Robert A. Weygand, URI's vice president of administration and finance, who walked us through university budget documents showing that the state contributed $58.1 million for URI operations this fiscal year.

Weygand said that if you factor in state contributions used to pay debt on voter-approved bonds for some university buildings -- money URI doesn’t see for yearly operations -- the total state contribution would be about $77.3 million.

State Budget Officer Thomas Mullaney told us the part-time legislature was budgeted to receive $37.2 million in state funding this year. Adding in federal funds brings that to $38.8 million. And money not spent last year brings this year’s total budget to about $40.4 million, he said.

The state funding pays for day-to-day operations of the House of Representatives and Senate, mostly for salaries for staff such as legislative pages and researchers.

When we heard from Hodgson by e-mail, he provided figures showing the same $58.1-million that Weygand cited for the state’s contribution to URI and $38.8 million for the legislature.

Any way you crunch the numbers, the state’s contribution to URI is still many millions of dollars more than what it is for the legislature, not nearly the same, as Hodgson said.

Hodgson said the context for his statement on the radio is important, noting that the state’s contribution to URI amounts to little more than 8 percent of the university’s $706-million budget.

""I believe that investing in public higher education must be a priority for sustained economic growth, and I am not satisfied with the value we are getting for our money from our part-time legislature,"" Hodgson said by e-mail.

Our ruling

Dawson Hodgson said, ""The amount of money that we put into running our own state legislature is nearly as much as we put into the University of Rhode Island.""

In fact, the state contributes $58 million to URI, roughly $20 million more than the legislature’s budget. That’s not ""nearly as much.""

Whether Hodgson’s point about budget priorities is valid or not, he got the numbers wrong.

"['Oregon', 'Transportation', 'BikePortland.org']","
Must cars stop if a cyclist dips a wheel into a crosswalk?
","
During the 2011 legislative session, lawmakers were hard at work passing a law they said would make Oregon streets safer -- by changing crosswalk rules.

Legislators decided to make it clear in Oregon law that a pedestrian was crossing the street -- and that cars should safely stop -- when any part of the pedestrian moved into a crosswalk with an intent to cross. That rule became law in summer 2011.

Jonathan Maus, who runs the blog BikePortland.org, announced recently on Twitter that the new law applied to cyclists as well. After some research he concluded that, ""If on your bike on sidewalk, all u have to do is dip wheel into road and cars must legally stop.""

Maus was specifically referring to crosswalks -- not just anywhere in the road. That becomes clear as you review his tweets and a blog post he wrote on the subject.

""I was super confused,"" he said about the law when we called to ask about the tweets. ""It's hard to tease out exactly ... especially on a bike. It's like a mutant vehicle.""

We wondered if that was an accurate reading of the relatively new law, so we called Sheila Lyons, the Oregon Department of Transportation’s Bicycle and Pedestrian Program manager.

She pointed us toward ORS 811.028, the section affected by the new law. Specifically: ""For the purposes of this section, a pedestrian is crossing the roadway in a crosswalk when any part or extension of the pedestrian, including but not limited to any part of the pedestrians [sic] body, wheelchair, cane, crutch or bicycle, moves onto the roadway in a crosswalk with the intent to proceed.""

Based on that, Maus seemed to be right, but we weren’t completely sold. We wondered whether it was legal for a bicyclist to ride a bike through a crosswalk. It seemed to us that they’d probably have to walk it.

We asked Lyons about that, too. The answer was, it turned out, that cyclists can bike on sidewalks and in crosswalks. But there are caveats. Some urban cores prohibit cyclists from riding on sidewalks, so it’s important to note local rules. Perhaps more importantly, ORS 814.410says mounted cyclists are operating a bicycle unsafely on a sidewalk if  they are moving ""at a speed greater than an ordinary walk when approaching or entering a crosswalk.""

Basically, cyclists can ride in a crosswalk so long as they’re not moving faster than an ordinary walker. And yes, dipping a wheel into the crosswalk is enough for a person riding a bike to signal intent to cross.

We called Ray Thomas, a Portland personal injury attorney who specializes in bike laws, to make sure we had this right. He said our reading of the laws was exactly as he understood them. He called the recent change ""the Oregon pedestrian revolution"" in that, legally speaking, pedestrians no longer need to enter the roadway completely to get a car to stop.  

Finally, we also talked to Oregon Sens. Jackie Dingfelder and Ginny Burdick, both of whom helped pass the crosswalk law. The Portland legislators confirmed that it was always their intent that the new law apply to slow-moving cyclists as well as pedestrians.

Maus tweeted that the new law meant a cyclist could dip a tire into a crosswalk and cars would legally have to stop to permit crossing. We checked the laws ourselves, spoke with a lawyer and the legislators involved and found that Maus is correct.

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said defense secretary nominee Chuck Hagel ""opposed sanctions against Iran""
","
The grilling Chuck Hagel, the nominee for Secretary of Defense, will receive from the U.S. Senate boils down to this : How much does he love Israel and hate Iran?

Politicians and foreign policy observers have been poring over Hagel’s votes and statements about the Middle East in reaction to President Barack Obama’s Jan. 7 nomination of Hagel, a Republican and former senator from Nebraska, to replace retiring Leon Panetta.

U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Miami, a member of the House foreign affairs committee who chairs a subcommittee on the Middle East, issued a statement Jan. 8 in which she said Hagel supported legislation that would have provided a lifeline to Fidel Castro, opposed sanctions on Iran and criticized Israel. We zeroed in on this part of her statement about Iran:

""He opposed sanctions against Iran, which has brazenly pursued the development of a nuclear weapon in open defiance of the international community as well as called for the destruction of one of our vital allies, Israel.""

Hagel’s stance on sanctions against Iran has sparked much discussion in recent weeks so we wanted to check Ros-Lehtinen’s statement that Hagel ""opposed sanctions against Iran.""

A conservative group, the Emergency Committee for Israel, made a similar claim about Hagel in an attack ad in December. (We already fact-checked a different claim in the ad on whether Hagel ruled out military action against Iran. We rated the statement Mostly False.)

Hagel voted both for and against sanctions

Hagel, a decorated Vietnam war veteran, won his first Senate seat in 1996 and retired in 2008 with an expertise in foreign affairs.

For some politicians, sanctioning an unpopular foe such as Iran is a no-brainer. But Hagel had a nuanced view of sanctions that can’t easily be summarized in a soundbite.

Spokespersons for Ros-Lehtinen sent us a list of Hagel’s votes and actions that they said showed he opposed sanctions. Hagel’s office at The Atlantic Council, a think tank that promotes transatlantic cooperation and international security, distributed a fact-sheet about his foreign policy views which shows the opposite, that he supported sanctions against Iran.

We found that both documents -- though they cherry-pick to support their viewpoints -- are partially accurate, because Hagel took votes both for and against sanctions against Iran.

Hagel consistently raised concern about Iran’s nuclear capabilities, but expressed doubt that sanctions would halt Iran, repeatedly calling for the United States to hold discussions with Iran. He also sometimes argued that sanctions cost the United States billions in lost revenue.

But he also left open the door for multilateral sanctions as a foreign policy tool.

To illustrate his views on sanctions, we will look at a few examples:

Hagel was one of two ""no"" votes in the Senate in 2001 to amend and extend for five years the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996. In a banking committee, his amendment for a two-year renewal, supported by the White House, was rejected.

The bill allowed the president to penalize companies that invested heavily in Iran’s energy sector. Some said the law was toothless since President Bill Clinton had waived it for some foreign firms in the past.

Hagel said in a speech that year that ""unilateral sanctions hardly ever work"" and that sanctions only work in the short term if they are multilateral and administered by the U.N.

In 2007, Hagel did not join the 72 Senate co-sponsors on The Iran Counter-Proliferation Act to amend the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, which subjects Iran to economic sanctions unless the country dismantled its nuclear enrichment-related program. That bill never got a vote.

That same year, the Senate voted 76-22 for an amendment to label the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp. a terrorist group, leading to sanctions. Hagel voted no.

In an interview with the Lincoln Journal Star, Hagel said he feared the administration could use that vote as cover for an attack.

""I voted against that resolution for that very reason,"" he said. ""It's a very dangerous resolution.""

In 2008, Hagel was one of two ""no"" votes on a banking committee to oppose the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act. 

Now, let’s look at examples when Hagel supported sanctions:

In 1998, Hagel voted along with the 90-4 majority in favor of the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act.

The New York Times wrote that President Clinton vetoed it because he said it would reduce his flexibility in dealing with foreign policy.

In 2000, Hagel was part of the Senate’s unanimous vote in favor of the Iran Nonproliferation Act. The bill directed the president to report to Congress on foreign persons who transferred goods or provided assistance related to Iran’s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons.

In 2006, the Senate passed by unanimous consent the Iran Freedom Support Act (sponsored by Ros-Lehtinen) to keep sanctions in effect. Under unanimous consent, all senators get a chance to object; none of the senators objected.

When Obama nominated him, Hagel defended his stance on Iran in an interview with a Nebraska newspaper:

""I have not supported unilateral sanctions because, when it is us alone, they don't work and they just isolate the United States,"" he said. ""United Nations sanctions are working. When we just decree something, that doesn't work.""

We asked Duke University political science professor Peter Feaver, who worked for the National Security Council in 1993-94 and 2005-07, if there would be reason to oppose some Iran sanctions and support others.

""Critics of unilateral sanctions say they let other countries free-ride on our tough policies -- better to get multilateral sanctions where everyone joins in,"" he told PolitiFact in an email. ""Proponents of unilateral sanctions say that they work to leverage multilateral sanctions, toughening them up beyond the lowest-common-denominator approach that typically characterize multilateral sanctions.  

""Also, some forms of unilateral sanctions -- particularly the financial levers that were used against Iran -- can overcome the free-rider problem because they forbid access to the U.S. financial system, which most countries desperately want access to. The record shows that the tough imposition of unilateral sanctions did help lead to tougher multilateral sanctions, so while Hagel's concerns were reasonable, the backers had a strong, indeed a stronger, case.""

A Congressional Research Service paper in December 2012 said that while sanctions on Iran have failed to halt its nuclear weapon program ""a broad international  coalition has imposed progressively strict sanctions on Iran’s oil export lifeline, adversely affecting Iran’s economy to the point where key Iran leaders are considering the need for a nuclear compromise.""

Our ruling

Ros-Lehtinen said that Hagel ""opposed sanctions against Iran, which has brazenly pursued the development of a nuclear weapon in open defiance of the international community as well as called for the destruction of one of our vital allies, Israel.""

Hagel did vote against a sanction bill in 2001, didn’t join 72 colleagues in co-sponsoring a sanction bill in 2007, voted against an amendment in 2007 that would have labeled an Iranian group terrorists and voted ""no"" in committee in 2008. But he voted in favor of sanction bills in 1998 and 2000, and another such bill passed by unanimous consent while he was in the Senate in 2006. Hagel often said unilateral sanctions don’t work, but he showed more support for multilateral sanctions.

When Ros-Lehtinen said Hagel ""opposed sanctions against Iran"" she oversimplified his lengthy history of votes and comments. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/jan/11/ileana-ros-lehtinen/ros-lehtinen-said-defense-secretary-nominee-hagel-/
"['Welfare', 'Texas', 'Chain email']","
Chain email says 11 states have more people on welfare than employed
","
""Death Spiral,"" proclaims a chain mail that an Austin reader brought to our attention Dec. 21, 2012.

That’s the headline on a U.S. map with 11 states highlighted and accompanying text that says, ""These 11 states now have more people on welfare than they do employed.""

We found the same message and map posted on blogs, discussion groups and Facebook. Even Texas’ attorney general tweeted about it Jan. 7. 
 
Is it true?

The ""death spiral"" phrase and the 11 highlighted states -- Alabama, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and South Carolina -- appear in a Nov. 25, 2012, Forbes column, and the map appears onscreen during a Nov. 29 Fox Business ""Varney and Co."" report on the commentary piece.

But the criteria used to identify Forbes’ ""death spiral"" states were not as simple as welfare and employment.

Forbes investment strategies editor Bill Baldwin wrote that those 11 states were ""at high risk of a fiscal tailspin"" because they had many people who received money from the government but maintained policies that ""chase out the private-sector jobs that support all that spending.""

Baldwin reached his conclusion by comparing ""makers"" and ""takers."" For this purpose, he wrote, ""a taker is someone who draws money from the government, as an employee, pensioner or welfare recipient. A maker is someone gainfully employed in the private sector."" Then he factored in an index that downgrades states for ""large debts, an uncompetitive business climate, weak home prices and bad trends in employment.""

The results, he said, showed states that were ""danger spots for investors.""

We’re not sold on designating government workers or pensioners as takers. Regardless, we wondered: Was there any way the email’s claim could be true?

Not so much, we learned.

First, it depends on what you call employment. Baldwin, as we saw, used private-sector jobs in his measure because he classed government employees as ""takers"" (a term he acknowledged was ""tendentious"" in a Dec. 3, 2012, followup interview on Fox Business).

But since the chain email discards that nuance, we decided to count up as many people as we could find with a job, government or private. That, we thought, would get to the heart of the viral message: welfare recipients outnumbering people who have jobs.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates many employment numbers, and Cheryl Abbot of the bureau’s Dallas office helped us locate its broadest head count of individuals who have a job. By phone, Abbot guided us to 2011 averages per state in the bureau’s household survey, which wraps in most private-sector workers, civilian government employees and self-employed people.

Then, it depends on what you call welfare. We spoke by phone with Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the liberal Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who said that when welfare comes up in public discourse -- talk of ""welfare reform"" or ""ending welfare as we know it"" -- people are often referring to Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, a cash assistance program created in 1996 to replace an older welfare system.

TANF goes only to families with children or to children directly, and other programs that provide cash aid to help with basic needs could reasonably be called welfare too, Schott said. An example she gave was the federal Supplemental Security Income program, which gives money to elderly and disabled people.

But in terms of trying to answer our question, she said, TANF data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services could serve as a ""good proxy"" for welfare. The department’s numbers are broken down by state -- and also by age, which Schott pointed out was relevant to our comparison because most TANF recipients are children.

Children don’t vote, of course, and most of them don’t hold jobs. So if you’re making a point about welfare recipients outvoting wage-earners — a common conservative theme that we thought was probably implied in the chain email — kids don’t factor in neatly.

According to April 4, 2012, data from Health and Human Services, children accounted for 74 percent of TANF recipients in 2011. Averages for the calendar year showed 4.6 million recipients, of whom 3.4 million were children.

With that in mind, we pulled 2011 state-by-state counts of adult TANF recipients and charted them alongside the employment data. Nowhere in any of the 50 states did the TANF adults equal more than 3 percent of the employed workers. The highest percentage was in Maine, where 13,821 adults on TANF equaled 2.1 percent of the 643,000 employed workers.

In most states, the group of TANF adults was equal to less than 1 percent of the number of people with jobs.

Separately, senior research fellow Robert Rector of the conservative Heritage Foundation gave us a broader definition of welfare -- 79 federal programs -- though even by that measure, he told us by phone, ""Welfare recipients do not outnumber workers.""

The programs Rector cited in May 3, 2012, testimony to the U.S. House Budget Committee were all means-tested (meaning beneficiaries qualified at least in part due to their income levels) and provided cash, food, housing, medical care, social services, training and certain education aid. Some programs that recipients had contributed to, such as Social Security and Medicare, were excluded.

On the list are major initiatives such as food stamps and the Supplemental Security Income program Schott mentioned, but also the Earned Income Tax Credit, which by definition goes to people with jobs, and smaller efforts such as helping to weatherize houses and educate migrants.

We sought to compare the data state by state, and counting adults only, as we did with the TANF numbers. But Rector said Heritage didn’t have the recipients broken down by states or by age.

Nationally in 2011, Rector said, the average number of recipients was approximately 100 million -- nearly a third of the U.S. population, he noted. According to the bureau’s employment data, 140 million people had a job that year.

Upshot: There were three employed people for every two ""welfare"" recipients, including children, as defined by the Heritage Foundation.

Because Schott had pointed out to us that the percentage of TANF recipients varied a lot from state to state, we asked Rector if he thought any of the states individually would have more welfare recipients (by Heritage’s standard) than employed residents.

""No, I don’t think that would be true,"" Rector said. ""That’s a pretty extreme statement. … That would be very, very large levels of dependency.""

Our ruling

Ripping off a map that was created for a different fiscal comparison, the chain email said 11 states had more residents on welfare than employed.

By either a broad definition of welfare or a narrow one, experts told us that’s a false and even ""extreme"" statement. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2013/jan/11/chain-email/chain-email-says-11-states-have-more-people-welfar/
"['Ohio', 'Congress', 'Retirement', 'Chain email']","
Can members of Congress retire with full pay after just one term?
","Political trends come and go, but the classics endure.

Such is the case with a chain email PolitiFact Ohio received to start the new year. When we received a nearly identical version a couple of years ago, we said it could be ""a new classic of the genre.""

The email claims that Congress gets special perks nobody else does; complains that a complacent media ignores the news, and requests that recipients of the email forward it on to 20 more people.

We examined one of the special perks mentioned in the email, that ""the staffers of Congress family members are exempt from having to pay back student loans."" The claim is confusingly worded, but we assumed that it referred to relatives of members of Congress and Congressional staffers.

We gave the statement a rating of Pants on Fire because it was (and is) ridiculously false. Relatives of members of Congress and Congressional staffers have to pay back their loans like everyone else.

But the still-circulating email contains another claim that several readers have asked about in recent days: that members of Congress can ""retire with the same pay after only one term.""

This claim is a classic in its own right. Our friends at the urban legend checker Snopes.com say it has been circulating in various chain emails since at least 2000.

The claim means that rank-and-file members of the House of Representatives would receive full pay of $174,000 per year, for the rest of their lives, after serving as little as two years.

Nice work if you can get it. But members of Congress can't.

A report on ""Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress,"" prepared in November by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, outlines how pension benefits are calculated.

The key provision: no member of Congress is eligible for any pension unless he or she has served in Congress for at least five years. (Senators serve six-year terms; House members must seek reelection every two years.)

To collect, a congressman or senator must be age 62, or be at least age 50 with 20 years of service, or be any age with 25 years of service.

Under the most recent pension program, adopted in 1984, the size of a pension is based on the highest three years of a member's salary, the number of years of service and a multiplier, which is 1.7 percent for the first 20 years of service and 1.0 percent for subsequent years.

Here’s an example, using a typical 25-year rank-and-file member who retired this year. The pension would be the sum of two calculations. First, multiply $172,443 [the average salary over the last three years] times 20 years times 0.017. Then, multiply $172,443 times 5 years times 0.01 and add that number to the first calculation. The total: about $67,250 per year.

A three-term congressman (or one-term senator) who has now reached retirement age would be eligible for an annual pension of $17,588 for six years of work. That's generous, but not close to full pay.

Federal law prevents members of Congress from getting full-pay retirement when they leave office. The report says, ""By law, the starting amount of a member's retirement annuity may not exceed 80 percent of his or her final salary.""

Under the formula, it would take 67 years of service to hit that limit.

So the email saying that members of Congress can ""receive full pay retirement after serving one term"" is blatantly bogus. It's never full pay and the only one-term members who would be eligible for any pension would be senators.

Snopes.com rated the pension claim as False. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org have also debunked the claim -- which, over the years, has been accompanied by assertions that members of Congress don't pay into their Social Security (they have since 1984) or that they don't contribute anything toward their retirement (they do).

For a bogus claim that’s been circulating at least 13 years, and for anyone who still spreads it, we’ll break out the matches. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2013/jan/11/chain-email/can-members-congress-retire-full-pay-after-just-on/

Fiscal cliff impact on taxes a matter of perspective
","
Even before the smoke cleared from the new year’s fiscal cliff battle, politicos were at it again.

They couldn’t agree whether the deal hiked taxes or cut them.

Erstwhile allies contradicted each other. Tax nemesis Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, tweeted that it was a tax cut. Members of Congress who signed his group’s pledge to never raise taxes kept their promises, he said.

U.S. Rep. Tom Price, a Roswell Republican and a fiscal hawk, came away with the opposite impression.

""My assessment was that it ultimately raised taxes and didn’t decrease any spending. In fact, it increased spending,"" Price said during a Jan. 2 interview on WMAL-FM, a Washington-area radio station.

So which one is it? A tax increase or a tax cut? We waded chin-deep into the swampy depths of federal budget making to find out.

We’ll tackle whether the deal is a spending cut or an increase in a separate story.

A spokesman for Price said that the congressman was referring to a variety of provisions that change taxes for individuals and businesses, such as the switch in marginal tax rates for those who make more than $400,00 a year and alterations to estate and investment tax rules.

But this is only part of the story.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issues independent analyses of legislation to help lawmakers gauge its impact on the federal government’s coffers.

It found that the fiscal cliff deal, otherwise known as the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, will actually cut the money the federal government raises through taxes by $3.6 trillion through 2022. This means that by its reckoning, the deal is a tax cut.

How can taxes rise and fall at the same time?

It’s a matter of perspective, experts told us.

The fiscal cliff was a legislative package of painful tax increases and spending cuts set to begin if Congress failed to take action on the budget by midnight Jan. 1. The lawmakers who designed it thought the measures would be so draconian that Congress would have to act before then.

It wasn’t, and the country fell off the cliff. But something about staring into the fiscal abyss stirred the House of Representatives into action. A deal passed hours into the new year.   

If it had failed to act, the old law would have placed projected tax revenue at $44 trillion through 2022, according to the CBO. But under the new deal, revenue would equal $40.4 trillion -- hence the $3.6 trillion tax cut

But there’s another way of assessing whether new tax legislation is a cut or increase: comparing the revenue to the taxes we used to pay in 2012.

From this perspective, they’re up. In August, the CBO released tax revenue projections based on an ""alternative fiscal scenario"" where taxes through 2022 would stay much the same as they were in 2012.

Its analysts found that receipts would have totaled $38.9 trillion. Under terms of the last-minute deal, they’re some $1.4 trillion higher.

Both of these perspectives, or ""baselines,"" have their strengths and weaknesses. Budget analysts use the first method because it keeps them from having to guess what future law will be. But the latter comparison can give more perspective on the law’s impact on consumer spending.

""When politicians talk about this, either analysis is legitimate,"" said Howard Gleckman, an Urban Institute expert.

The trick is to make sure you don’t mix up your baselines. If you’re comparing current taxes with the ones we paid in 2012, use it for spending as well to avoid an apples-to-oranges comparison. (Price runs into trouble on this front. We’ll address this in a future PolitiFact.)

This brings us to the unsatisfying conclusion that Price is right and wrong. The fiscal cliff deal raises taxes compared with prior policy, but it lowered them compared with prior law.

Or, in other words, if Congress kept the 2012 law, our taxes would be higher than they are now. But if our taxes stayed at 2012 levels, they’d be lower.  

This means Price’s statement that the fiscal cliff deal ""ultimately raised taxes"" is Half True. It is accurate but leaves out important details.

"['Transportation', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
McDonnell says his roads plan would make Virginia the only state to end its gas tax
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell opened the 2013 General Assembly session by proposing a dramatic change to the way Virginia raises money for building and maintaining roads.

""The proposal would make Virginia the first state in the nation to eliminate the state tax on gasoline,"" McDonnell said in a Jan. 9 news conference announcing the plan.

We wondered if his claim is correct, so we did some checking.

McDonnell’s plan would end the Virginia’s 17.5-cent excise tax on a gallon of gas. The revenue would be replaced by increasing the state’s 5 percent sales tax to 5.8 percent and dedicating the new proceeds to roads. Diesel would still carry a 17.5 cent per gallon excise tax.

Virginia’s gas tax rate has been unchanged since 1987. With cars getting better mileage and using alternative fuels, McDonnell says the levy no longer produces enough money to pay for Virginia’s road needs. Sales tax revenues, in contrast, are expected to steadily grow.

All states have some form of excise tax on gasoline, according to a report by the American Petroleum Institute and a joint study published by the National Council of State Legislatures and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Center for Excellence in Public Finance. Thirty-eight states impose a flat, per-gallon tax like Virginia. Other states set the tax to a percentage of the price of gas per gallon. A few states levy a combination of excise and sales taxes on gas.

All told, Virginia had the 11th lowest gas excise tax in the nation at the start year, according to the API. The federal government, we should note, also collects an 18.4 cents per gallon excise tax.

So it’s clear that all states tax gas. But before ruling on the governor’s claim, one question remains: If McDonnell’s plan passes, does that mean that motorists will pay zero state gas tax at Virginia pumps?

The answer is no.

Virginia would continue to collect an 0.6-cent-per-gallon petroleum storage tank fee that is charged in addition to the excise tax.

The levy isn’t limited to gasoline -- it’s collected on most fuel sales. Unlike the excise tax, it does not support transportation. Instead, the money goes to a program, run by the Department of Environmental Quality, that reimburses qualified landowners for some of the cost to remove underground fuel storage tanks. The fund collected $3 million in November and paid out $3.4 million that month, with just under $1 million in the bank. Over 2,000 claims were pending at the end of November.

Experts we consulted did not agree on whether the fee constitutes a ""gasoline tax."" The American Petroleum Institute counts it among ""other taxes"" on gasoline in its summary of state levies.  Joung Lee, associate director of finance at AASHTO, said the association would consider the storage tank fee a special-purpose user fee, not a gasoline tax.

He also said Virginia’s proposal would put the state in a unique position.

""Our understanding is that every state has a flat per gallon excise tax for fuels and some also have a supplemental sales tax,"" Lee said. ""Virginia’s proposal is more unique in that there have been some discussions to keep up with inflation by indexing the gas tax or converting to a sales tax on gasoline but Virginia is not just proposing a sales tax on fuel but making transportation part of the overall sales tax regime.""

Scott Drenkard, economist with the Tax Foundation, said it’s accurate to say that Virginia ""would be the first state without a gasoline excise tax.""

We should also note that fuel distributors in 12 Northern Virginia localities pay a 2.1 percent sales tax on gas and other fuels. Although the levy is sanctioned by state law, the $70 million in annual revenues it produces do not go into the state budget -- they are used to help pay for mass transit systems that shuttle workers to and from Washington. McDonnell’s plan would not affect this local tax.

Our ruling

McDonnell said his proposal to overhaul road funding would make Virginia the first state to eliminate its gasoline tax.

The governor wants replace Virginia’s 17.5-cent-a-gallon excise tax on gas with an increase in the state sales tax. His plan, if approved, would make Virginia the only state without an excise gasoline tax.

His proposal would leave intact an additional 0.6-cent-a-gallon levy at Virginia pumps that goes into a fund to help landowners remove old petroleum storage tanks. Virginians would continue to pay some state gasoline tax -- 6 cents on a 10 gallon fill up.

We won’t quibble about this small levy, which is not used to build roads. We rate McDonnell’s statement True.",/factchecks/2013/jan/10/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-his-roads-plan-would-make-virginia-/
"['New Jersey', 'Taxes', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says taxes, fees raised 115 times in the 8 years before he became governor
","

Chris Christie hasn’t completed his first term as governor yet but under his leadership, the state is in better shape than during previous administrations, he suggested Tuesday.

During his State of the State address, Christie listed a number of accomplishments achieved since taking office in January 2010. Among them: a 2 percent property tax cap, pension and health benefits reforms, balanced budgets (required by state law), no new taxes and job growth.

""A far different picture from the prior eight years, which saw 115 increases in taxes and fees,"" Christie said during his address in the Assembly chamber at the Statehouse in Trenton.

That’s a lot of increases, but Christie is right. And this isn’t the first time PolitiFact New Jersey has checked this claim.

Let’s revisit our original fact-check on a similar claim made by state Sen. Tom Kean Jr. in an Oct. 7, 2011 news release.

At that time Kean said, ""Over the past 10 years, Democrats have been in control of the Legislature and have done a disservice to New Jersey workers and their families by raising taxes over 115 times, making New Jersey increasingly unaffordable and chasing jobs to neighboring states.""

Republicans provided us with a list that included tax and fee hikes as well as tax policy changes that occurred between fiscal years 2003 and 2010. It’s worth noting that even though Kean specified increases over a 10-year time frame and Christie specified an eight-year time frame, both were using the same list of tax and fee increases. Kean’s claim was rated Half True.

Now let’s look back at the increases in question.

Democrats held legislative majorities in the eight years before Christie became governor. His predecessors during that time were Jim McGreevey, Richard Codey and Jon Corzine.

Although most of the bills in question during their tenures were sponsored by Democrats, a few had Republican support.

Among the many tax increases were raising the sales tax from 6 percent to 7 percent and applying the tax to things such as tanning and limousine services. Also, the state twice increased the gross income tax on New Jerseyans with six-figure incomes: in 2004 for those with income exceeding $500,000 and again in 2009 for those incomes above $400,000.

Also among the increases were hikes in dozens of fees, such as a new $1.50 fee on the sale of new vehicle tires. So while those types of measures cost some residents more money, they are not tax increases.

Overall, the list provided by Republicans showed that there were dozens of increases in taxes or fees or other tax policy changes that could result in individuals or businesses paying higher taxes.

The key difference between Kean’s claim in 2011 and Christie’s, though, is that Kean specified only tax increases and tied those increases to driving jobs out of state. The governor said taxes and fees were raised 115 times in the eight years before he took office.

""The Governor was correct,"" spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an e-mail Wednesday.

Our ruling

In sharing some of the state’s achievements during his State of the State address Tuesday, Christie talked about a variety of fiscal goals he has overseen since taking office in 2010:  balanced budgets (a state requirement),, tax relief, pension and health  reforms, and job growth. ""A far different picture from the prior eight years, which saw 115 increases in taxes and fees,"" he said.

We have checked that claim before, when Kean made a similar statement in a 2011 news release. Back then Kean mentioned only tax increases, but there were quite a few fee increases, too. While higher fees represent more cost for taxpayers, they are not tax hikes. Christie, however, got it right when he said taxes and fees.

We rate the governor’s statement True.

Wendy Davis says Texas ""dead last"" in mental health spending
","
A Democratic state senator unleashed Twitter posts on the first day of the 2013 legislative session saying what she thinks lawmakers should accomplish.

The Jan. 8, 2013, posts by Wendy Davis of Fort Worth included a familiar claim about the state’s low standing in mental health spending. ""It's time for the Texas Legislature to take responsibility and move up from dead last in support for mental health,"" Davis said.

Last in the land?

We explored similar territory in January 2010, rating as Mostly True candidate Marc Katz’s claim that Texas then ranked last in spending for mental health care. For that fact check, we relied on the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation’s roundup of per-person mental health care spending for the 50 states in fiscal 2006. According to its analysis, Texas ranked 49th among the states that year in per capita spending, not quite last. At expenditures of $34.57 per resident, Texas bested New Mexico, which spent $25.58. The national average was $103.53. In total dollars spent, Texas ranked 10th in 2006, spending about $805 million.

Davis spokesman Rick Svatora said the senator drew on a Dec. 18, 2012, news report by WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas, which quoted the liberal Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities as saying that Texas ranks last in the country in per-person mental health spending.

Anne Dunkelberg, the center’s associate director, told us by email that the center had passed information to WFAA about spending in fiscal 2009 as written up in an August 2012 report by the Texas-based Hogg Foundation for Mental Health.

We found the Kaiser foundation’s latest state-by-state breakdown with help from Gyl Switzer, public policy director of Mental Health America of Texas, which advocates for programs that prevent and treat mental illness. A footnote to the research says the figures come from the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute, Inc., which says it’s the only national association to represent state mental health commissioners/directors and their agencies.

Texas was last among the states in such per-capita spending in 2009, 2008 and 2007, according to the charts for those years, though the 2007 chart shows no available data for Hawaii. 
The latest comparison: In fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010, Texas spent nearly $980 million total on mental health services, placing ninth nationally, according to a foundation chart. Its per-person spending of $38.99 placed the state 49th--not last--among the states. Idaho, with per-capita spending of $36.64, was 50th, with Maine No. 1 at per-capita spending of $346.92. The national average was $120.56.

Dunkelberg noted that the 2010 breakdown, posted by the foundation on Nov. 20, 2012, suggests Idaho saw its per-capita spending drop by nearly $8, from $44 in 2009. In 2010, Texas spending was up 61 cents per person from its $38.38 in 2009, according to the state-by-state charts. Texas surpassed a state, Dunkelberg wrote, ""not because of a significant improvement in our per-capita investment in mental health, but because poor Idaho cut per-capita spending."" 
Finally, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, which folds in the state agency over mental health, replied to our inquiry about the Kaiser breakdown by pointing out the analyzed figures do not take into account all funding for mental health services and saying it ""doesn’t really give a clear picture of all of the money that goes into mental health spending in Texas."" Christine Mann said by email the unnoted funding includes aid funneled through government-supported insurance programs plus services via agencies such as the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the Texas Education Agency, the Texas Youth Commission, the Department of Family & Protective Services and the Department of Aging and Disability Services.

Mann said by phone that her agency does not have a figure for total Texas spending on mental health services nor has it compared spending on mental health services among the states.

A footnote to the 2010 Kaiser chart says its Texas figure includes money spent on mental health services for prisoners.

Dunkelberg, asked to comment on Mann’s critique, said the Kaiser breakdowns do not reflect all mental health funding--for any state. Regardless, Dunkelberg wrote, ""the state ranking is a good measure of direct public and community (mental health) spending by a state for the population that is NOT in prison, or"" served by the agency that bird-dogs child abuse ""or on Medicaid.""  In each state, too, she said, it’s ""likely that Medicaid is a very large payer for (mental health) services, and also likely that no one is tracking that expenditure.""

Our ruling

Davis said Texas is ""dead last"" in mental health spending.

The Kaiser-posted figures do not take into account all mental health spending--for any state. But unless more comprehensive research surfaces, the figures appear to be the best way to compare relative spending. 
And in 2010, the latest year analyzed, Texas spent more in raw dollars on mental health services than 41 states. But in per-resident spending--a better metric for comparing states--Texas ranked second-to-last to Idaho after ranking last to all other states for several years.

"['Ohio', 'Health Care', 'Regulation', 'Jim Renacci']","
Jim Renacci says every American will pay a $63 fee as part of the health reform law
","
 Rep. Jim Renacci has never been a fan of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. 
In fact, the Ohio Republican won a pair of congressional elections after lambasting the Democrats he defeated for backing it. 
Renacci, of Wadsworth, continued his crusade against the health care reform law in a Dec. 21 column published in The Daily Record of Wooster, Ohio, where he said that ""many of the fees and penalties in the President’s health care law will begin to take effect"" on Jan. 1, 2013.

""One of them is a $63 charge every American will begin paying as a way to cover some of the increased costs associated with providing health insurance to those with pre-existing conditions,"" his column said.

""For many, this new fee will be paid for by their employer. While that's good news for many American families, whose budgets are already stretched tightly, it is problematic for business of all sizes. For large businesses, this new fee could equal tens of millions of more dollars being shipped to Washington.""

In an email relayed by his press spokesman, Renacci elaborated on his criticism, noting that businesses won’t be able to use the money they pay for those fees to ""hire expand or make capital investments.""

""If you want a real world example of how unfriendly to business the President’s health care law will be, look no further,"" Renacci said in the email. ""Now is certainly not the time to make it more expensive to do business in America.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to look into his claim about the fee.

Details about the fee emerged last month when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released proposed regulations that would impose a three-year temporary assessment on employer sponsored health plans, starting in 2014. HHS estimated the fee would amount to $5.25 each month for every covered beneficiary, which works out to $63 per year.

The fee is designed to raise $25 billion over three years to cushion health insurance companies from unexpected costs they’ll begin to encounter in 2014 when the law bans them from refusing to cover people who are already ill.

According to the Associated Press, the fee would be assessed on all ""major medical"" insurance plans, including those provided by employers and those purchased individually by consumers.

Most of the money would go into a fund administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The U.S. Treasury would get $5 billion to offset the cost of shoring up employer-sponsored coverage for early retirees. The per-person amount of the fees would diminish each year before phasing out in 2017. The fees are designed to raise $12 billion in 2014, $8 billion in 2015 and $5 billion in 2016.

The law firm McDermott, Will & Emery analyzed the proposed regulations and said the yearly contributions that an employer pays would be based on the number of individuals covered under its plan, not the number of employees who participate. For example, a family of four covered under an employee’s insurance plan would be regarded as four ""covered lives"" and the employer would have to pay the fee for four people. The payments would be tax deductible to employers as an ordinary and necessary business expense.

HHS spokesman Fabien Levy described the fee as one component of a comprehensive legislative package that’s designed to save money for consumers and businesses. Other money-saving changes have already gone into effect, including prescription drug savings for senior citizens and allowing adults under age 26 to remain on their parents’ insurance plans.

""The health care law will help bring down costs and save money for American families,"" Levy said. ""This program will help ensure employers no longer have to shoulder the cost of caring for the uninsured, which has raised businesses’ health care costs for decades.""

But the fee Renacci targeted has not been finalized, Levy said. Comments on the proposed regulation were due at the Department of Health and Human Services on Dec. 31.

In an email, Renacci spokesman Shawn Ryan said Renacci’s date error was an ""honest mistake,"" that wasn’t an attempt to mislead anyone. Although the rule has not been finalized, Ryan said that the Obama administration, through HHS, ""has made it very clear - even by just proposing the rule - that they fully intend to implement it.""

In a news release, Columbus-area Republican Rep. Patrick Tiberi, the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures, called the fee a ""hidden tax""  that would be imposed on 190 million Americans who are enrolled in health care plans. He also provided feedback to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. His Dec. 21 letter to Sebelius said the fee would discourage employers from insuring their workers.

""While we understand the importance of ensuring those with pre-existing conditions have access to affordable care, this regulation could cause some people to lose their health care coverage altogether,"" said the letter that Tiberi sent with other Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee.

So where does this leave Renacci’s claim?

There is an element of truth in his statement. The Department of Health and Human Services has indeed proposed a new $63 fee on every insured person that would be used to cover some costs associated with extending health insurance coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions.

But his claim scrambles the details on some critical facts. 
On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/jan/10/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-says-every-american-will-pay-63-fee-pa/

Rubio's infamous boots were made in India, not Wisconsin
","Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is trying to stamp out criticism from other presidential candidates about his slick, zip-up boots by saying he’s giving American business a leg up. Rubio’s ankle boots became the subject of Internet scrutiny after he was photographed wearing them in New Hampshire on Jan. 3, 2016. Pundits and fashion columnists commented on them ad nauseam. Rubio drew fire from his GOP rivals for being perhaps a bit too chic for the campaign trail. Some speculated they were to make the 5-foot-10 senator appear taller. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul called the boots ""cute"" and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s Right to Rise super PAC made a commercial mocking them. While Rubio initially called the focus on his footwear ""craziness,"" he’s worked at thinking on his feet. At a Jan. 18 campaign event in Waverly, Iowa, a voter jokingly asked about the boots. Rubio declared his boots, appropriately outfitted with a Cuban heel, are a patriotic choice. ""They sold out of those boots online,"" Rubio said. ""They’re made in Wisconsin. Florsheim! You know what that means? That means I did more for American business in one week than Barack Obama did in seven years!"" He’s right that Florsheim’s website says some sizes of their $135 Duke boots are out of stock, but they should be available by Feb. 1. A Florsheim spokesman told us sales of that style have ""increased significantly"" since Rubio was shown wearing them. As for the part about being made in Wisconsin, well, Rubio probably should have watched his step. Like all of the Glendale, Wis., company’s shoes, Rubio’s boots aren’t made in the United States. The company did recently collaborate with designer George Esquivel to create a luxury shoe line that is made in California, but Florsheim said their products are made in Asia, mostly from China. That trend goes back to the 1970s, when Florsheim’s then-owner, St. Louis-based International Shoe Co., moved production to India, where Rubio’s Duke boots were manufactured. The company also makes some items in Italy. Founded in 1892 in Chicago, Florsheim once had five U.S. factories and 2,500 employees by the 1920s. While at one time holding 70 percent of the men’s shoe market, the company eventually suffered from lackluster sales and a stodgy image, declaring bankruptcy in 2002. It was resurrected by Florsheim family scions through Weyco Group, the same company that distributes shoe brands like Nunn Bush and Stacy Adams (also foreign-made). No shoes are made at Weyco’s headquarters in suburban Milwaukee. It’s not really surprising that the American company’s boots are imports, as shoe manufacturing in the United States is on shaky footing these days. The American Apparel and Footwear Association said that domestic production has started to increase in recent years, but U.S. boot and shoe sales are still around 98 percent imports. Rubio’s campaign didn’t respond when we pointed out the boots were not made in America. There are still bootmakers in Wisconsin, however. Weinbrenner Shoe Company, for example, makes work boots in two central Wisconsin factories, and Allen Edmonds makes most of its high-end shoes and boots in Port Washington, about 20 miles north of Glendale.

Paul Ryan says 'if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor' as 50 years ago
","The newly installed House speaker, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., recently took to Medium to set the stage for a forum in Columbia, S.C., on Republican efforts to fight poverty. The forum, hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation, drew six 2016 Republican presidential candidates – former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, retired physician Ben Carson, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. In his Medium column, Ryan wrote that a new direction was needed on government anti-poverty efforts. ""We’ve been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years now,"" he wrote. ""And I don’t think you can call it anything but a stalemate. The federal government has spent trillions of dollars. And yet today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago. I’m not saying we haven’t made progress. We have. But today we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. What we need is a safety net that lifts people out of poverty – that helps them earn a good paycheck so they can support themselves."" Here, we’ll check Ryan’s statement that ""today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago."" When we asked Ryan’s staff for their evidence, they pointed us to an academic paper by Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline, Emmanuel Saez and Nicholas Turner, ""Is the United States Still a Land of Opportunity? Recent Trends in Intergenerational Mobility"" from January 2014. Chetty and Hendren are at Harvard, Kline and Saez are at the University of California-Berkeley, and Turner was with the U.S. Treasury Department. The paper, based on extensive analysis of income and educational-attainment data, found that ""intergenerational mobility"" has ""remained extremely stable"" since the generation of Americans born in 1971. ""We find that children entering the labor market today have the same chances of moving up in the income distribution (relative to their parents) as children born in the 1970s,"" the authors wrote. When we asked one of the co-authors, Saez, whether Ryan’s summary left out anything important, he said no. ""Yes, this is broadly correct,"" Saez told PolitiFact. Saez said the paper shows the odds of staying in the bottom one-fifth of the income distribution when your parents were in the bottom one-fifth have stayed stable for the past four to five decades. The paper and Saez in the interview both noted one caveat – that the consequences of the pattern Ryan is citing have worse effects today because inequality has grown over the same period. ""Because inequality has risen,"" the paper notes, ""the consequences of the ‘birth lottery’ – the parents to whom a child is born – are larger today than in the past."" However, this caveat doesn’t undermine Ryan’s point. If anything, it accentuates it. (We're also not penalizing Ryan for rounding up the study's length to 50 years.) Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and chief economist at the jobs site Indeed, said the paper Ryan chose is a credible one within the profession. ""These are the authors I would turn to"" when looking at intergenerational mobility. Our ruling Ryan wrote that ""today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago."" His support for this claim – a respected academic paper published in 2014 – found exactly what Ryan described.

Virginia NARAL head errs on self-induced abortions in Texas
","On the opening day of the Virginia General Assembly, abortion rights advocates held a news conference to urge lawmakers to sign a ""statement of intent in support of women’s health and rights."" Tarina Keene, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, said it’s time to stop an avalanche of abortion restrictions that have been approved in Virginia and across the nation during the past five years and that she said are threatening women’s health. ""Recently, research out of Texas revealed that due to the rapidly declining number of women’s health centers in that state, over 100,000 women - 100,000 women - have attempted to self-induce abortion in the past year alone,"" Keene said. ""This is what happens when you shame and degrade women,"" she added. ""You encourage hateful, violent rhetoric and attack the fundamental rights of women."" We wondered whether her jaw-dropping figure - more than 100,000 Texas women in one year attempted self-abortion - is correct. Keene referred us to a November 2015 report by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas, a research group that focuses on the impact of the state’s reproductive laws. The organization conducted a survey of 779 Texas women ages 18 to 49 in December 2014 and January 2015. When the participants were asked whether they ""ever"" tried to end a pregnancy on their own, 1.7 percent said yes. The researchers were concerned that some of the women might not be willing to admit they’ve tried to self-abort. So they also asked each participant whether her best friend ""ever"" tried to end a pregnancy by herself. The response: 1.8 percent said they were ""sure"" their best friend had done so, and another 2.3 percent ""suspected"" that had happened. The researchers concluded that the proportion of Texas women who have tried to self-abort falls somewhere between the 1.7 percent who said they did so and the 4.1 percent who said they either were sure or suspected their best friend had tried. That converts to somewhere between 100,000 and 240,000 women ages 18 to 49 in the Lone Star State. Again, this is an estimate of the women who tried ""ever"" in their lives to self-abort. Keene makes a significant error in saying the research shows that more than 100,000 of the incidents occurred ""in the last year alone."" The timing is important, because a number of pro-abortion groups are linking the study’s figure to a series of abortion restrictions Texas enacted in 2013. The state banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy; required abortion clinics to meet the same standards as hospital-style surgical centers; and mandated that a doctor have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where he or she performs abortions. ""Definitely, the timing of most of the self-induced abortions is not connected to the legislation,"" said Daniel Grossman,who headed the research team. He told us he plans to continue surveying Texas women. ""To make any estimate whether self-abortion goes up because of these laws will take years to study,"" Grossman said.   Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a challenge from reproductive rights groups that the laws block constitutional rights to an abortion. More than half of the 41 abortion clinics in Texas have closed since 2012, just before the legislation was introduced. The researchers noted that self-abortion rates are likely to be higher in Texas than in the rest of the nation, in part because of its shared border with Mexico where Misoprostol, a drug that effectively can end pregnancies, ""is often available in pharmacies without a prescription."" Other methods reported by those who said they knew someone who attempted a self-induced abortion included herbs or homeopathic remedies; getting hit in the stomach; using alcohol or illegal drugs; and taking hormonal pills. Our ruling Keene said that ""due to the rapidly declining number of women’s health care centers"" in Texas, more than ""100,000 women have attempted to self-induce abortion in the past year alone."" She’s wrong. The study to which she refers estimates that between 100,000 and 240,000 Texas women ages 18 to 49 attempted to self-abort at some point in their lives. We don’t mean to diminish that finding; it suggests a lot of women have put their health in danger. But lumping the women’s efforts into the ""past year,"" Keene inaccurately places the blame for all self-abortion attempts on restrictions on abortion clinics that Texas passed in 2013. We rate her statement False.",/factchecks/2016/jan/19/tarina-keene/virginia-naral-head-errs-self-induced-abortions-te/
"['Abortion', 'Texas', 'Wendy Davis']","
A flawed Wendy Davis claim: 1 in 3 women has an abortion in her lifetime
","Former Fort Worth state Sen. Wendy Davis, the 2014 Democratic gubernatorial nominee, wants the Supreme Court to reverse the Texas law that critics say will make it harder for far-flung Texans to access abortions. Republicans who carried the changes into law said their goal was to improve women’s health by requiring abortion doctors to gain admitting privileges in a nearby hospital and requiring abortions to be performed in hospital-like settings. Abortion providers sued, arguing the regulations — impossible for many clinics to meet — were unnecessary because they offered no health benefits for a relatively low-risk procedure. Davis, joined by women with legislative experience who, like Davis, have revealed decisions to terminate pregnancies, said in the Jan. 4, 2016, brief that the law could affect women in need if it’s allowed to be enforced by leaving about 10 clinics operating in the state’s largest cities—down from more than 40 when House Bill 2 was signed into law in 2013. In the brief, the women say they’re ""grateful that they were able to exercise their rights in nearby doctor’s offices and abortion clinics without the burdens of travel, delay and additional expense that would be imposed on Texas women if HB 2 were to remain in force."" Generally, the brief says, false ""stereotypes persist in society and in state legislatures regarding women who exercise their right to choose. The reality is that approximately one out of every three women in this country has had an abortion in her lifetime."" The brief later says: ""One in every three women has an abortion during her lifetime."" A reader asked us to check that ""lifetime"" statement. Nationally in 2011, an estimated 1.1 million abortions were performed, down nearly 14 percent from 2008, according to a March 2014 article by the New York-based Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights. The 2011 estimate broke out to 16.9 abortions for every 1,000 women aged 15-44, the researchers wrote. To our inquiry, Davis told us by email that Linda Goldstein, among lawyers who drafted the brief, had advised that, as footnoted in the brief, a 1998 Guttmacher study was the basis of the one-in-three statement. In a follow-up email, Davis said the 1998 study was a precursor to a more recent estimate, in a 2011 Guttmacher study, that one in three women will have an abortion by age 45. Separately, Michael New, a visiting associate professor at Florida’s Ave Maria University who has questioned the prevalence of abortions, responded to our inquiry by pointing out a September 2015 story by the FactChecker at The Washington Post that found flaws in a claim that one in three women will have an abortion ""by the age of 45."" The Post story explains the purpose of the 2011 Guttmacher report was to update older estimates that 43 percent of women of reproductive age would have an abortion by age 45. The abortion rate had declined over intervening years, the story notes, and researchers hypothesized that the proportion of women who will have an abortion during their lifetime also probably declined. The study used abortion rates (the number of abortions per 1,000 women) for subgroups of women (including age, socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity) who responded to the institute’s 2008 Abortion Patient Survey of nearly 9,500 women, the Post summed up. Next, researchers used survey data to find the first abortion rate for age subgroups, multiplied the rate by the number of years in each age group and added up the number of first-time abortions that had taken place by the time women were 45. This was called the ""cumulative first abortion rate,"" through which they came up with the ""lifetime incidence"" of abortion, or the ""one in three"" figure, the Post reported. To grasp the basis of Davis’s claim, we turned first to the 1998 study footnoted in the brief and then the 2011 follow-up. 1998 study The December 1998 study, ""Unintended Pregnancy in the United States,"" by Stanley K. Henshaw, then the institute’s deputy director of research, offers estimates for the incidence of abortions in 1994--more than 20 years ago. A Guttmacher summary says Henshaw drew on national surveys of women taken in 1982, 1988 and 1995 plus other data to estimate 1994 rates and percentages of unintended birth and pregnancy and the proportion of women who had experienced an unintended birth, an abortion or both. The study itself describes the cited National Surveys of Family Growth as a ""periodic fertility survey"" that collects detailed reproductive and contraceptive histories and related information from women of reproductive age. ""Forty-eight percent of women aged 15-44 in 1994 had had at least one unplanned pregnancy sometime in their lives,"" Henshaw wrote, ""28% had had one or more unplanned births, 30% had had one or more abortions and 11% had had both."" Put another way, then, the study suggested that as of 1994, nearly one third of women of childbearing age had had an abortion. The likelihood of women having had an abortion varied by age. A chart indicates some 40 percent of women aged 30-34 in 1994 had had one or more abortions; at the low end, 7 percent of women aged 15-19 had had one or more abortions.  SOURCE: Study, ""Unintended Pregnancy in the United States,"" S.K. Henshaw, the Guttmacher Institute, December 1998 (accessed Jan. 12, 2016) The summary continues: ""At 1994 rates, women can expect to have 1.42 unintended pregnancies by the time they are 45, and at 1992 rates, 43% of women will have had an abortion."" The study says ""14% of women can expect to have had an abortion before age 20, 37% by age 30 and 43% by age 45."" 2011 study notes declining abortion rate Rebecca Wind, a Guttmacher spokeswoman, responded to our request for elaboration with an email stating: ""The stat Wendy Davis cited was correct a few years ago; as abortion rates have declined, so have lifetime incidence rates."" Wind guided us to the 2011 study, ""Changes in Abortion Rates Between 2000 and 2008 and Lifetime Incidence of Abortion,"" which notes the U.S. ""abortion rate has declined since 1992, and the proportion of women who will terminate a pregnancy in their lifetime has probably declined as well."" The authors analyzed abortion rates from 2000 through 2008 and estimated the proportion of women of reproductive age ""who will have an abortion by age 45."" Women ""aged 40 and older had"" an abortion ""rate of 300.9 per 1,000 women,"" the study says. ""Put differently, an estimated 30.1% of women aged 15–44 in 2008 will have an abortion by age 45 if exposed to prevailing abortion rates throughout their reproductive lives,"" it says. ""Similarly, an estimated 8.3% of U.S. women would have had an abortion by age 20 and 25.1% by age 30."" Broadly, the study notes, the ""proportion of women expected to have an abortion by age 45 declined substantially, from 43% in 1992 to 30% in 2008 and this pattern parallels the substantial decline in abortion rates during that time period. ""Still, that almost one-third of women are anticipated to have an abortion by age 45 suggests that it is not an uncommon procedure,"" the study says. The study closes by saying that if ""current"" abortion rates hold, ""almost one-third of American women will obtain an abortion in their lifetime."" To our inquiry, Guttmacher scientist Rachel Jones told us by email that Davis’s statement referring to all women was incorrect ""because it implied that a random sample of women in 2016 would find that 30% of them would have had an abortion. Our stat is the projected lifetime incidence of abortion among women in 2008 by the time they turn 45. (That is, lots of women currently aged 15-44 have not had abortions but many will before they exit their reproductive years.)"" Jones added: ""We know that the abortion rate has dropped substantially since 2008, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the lifetime incidence has. There also have to be concomitant changes in age-specific first-abortion rates."" She said that until 2014 data is analyzed, likely in 2017, it’s only appropriate to say that given 2008 abortion rates, ""an estimated 30% of women will have an abortion by age 45."" Other analyses We heard back from a couple of activists opposed to abortion including New, who emphasized Guttmacher’s 2011 analysis was retrospective, drawing on 2008 abortion data, while there may continue to be fewer U.S. abortions year by year. ""The abortion rate,"" New said by email, ""has been falling consistently since the early 1980s and continues to fall,"" especially among teens and young adults, he emailed, which might mean, if trends continue, that women in general will be less likely to have an abortion. Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of the Susan B. Anthony List, an organization dedicated to ending abortion, provided a statement by email noting that a physicist, William Johnston, has estimated that as of 2008, about 28 percent of U.S. women aged 15-64 had had abortions--up from 2.8 percent in 1973, the year the Supreme Court established a woman's constitutional right to end a pregnancy. Our ruling Davis said: ""One in every three women has an abortion during her lifetime."" That statement is a bit misleading in that it sounds like it is based on hard data showing one in three women have had abortions. Of late, the statistic is based on extrapolations of 2008 data analyzed by the Guttmacher Institute in an effort to estimate how many women will have an abortion during their reproductive years. Meantime, abortion rates have generally declined so it’s possible such estimates don’t reflect reality.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Military', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Less than 10 percent of defense budget is for fighting terrorism, Sanders says
","Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders criticized defense spending during the Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina, saying that the out-of-control budget isn’t focused enough on fighting modern threats. ""Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union,"" Sanders said. ""Very little of that budget — less than 10 percent — actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism."" That seems like very little from a budget that tops $600 billion for fiscal year 2016, so we decided to look into it. What we found is that while Sanders was talking primarily about money earmarked for fighting the group known as Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL), he’s not considering the true fungibility of the Defense Department’s budget. Deciphering defense Sanders’ campaign has used this talking point before, and shared the math with us. They cited more than $600 billion in defense spending, saying only $5.5 billion has gone to fighting ISIS and around $42 billion has gone to operations in Afghanistan, much of which is used to fight al-Qaida. In all, they said the government has spent about 7.9 percent of the defense budget on fighting terrorism. But experts told us that’s a very narrow view of how the defense budget works, which is the largest of any single country in the world by far. For fiscal year 2016, total defense spending clocked in at almost $607 billion overall in the spending bill Congress passed in December 2015. That includes all defense-related appropriations, including mandatory funding for retirement and pension payments and nuclear weapons spending at the Department of Energy. We’re concerned primarily with two parts of the Defense Department budget: Base discretionary spending and the Overseas Contingency Operations fund. Base discretionary funding is the biggest chunk of the budget. That’s all the money the U.S. military gets to buy planes and tanks, fund research, keep bases open and so forth. Laicie Heeley, a fellow with the Budgeting for Foreign Affairs and Defense program at the Washington-based Stimson Center, said the Defense Department’s base for 2016, minus other defense-related spending, is around $522.9 billion. That’s a $26.8 billion increase from last year, she said. But money for fighting wars comes from the so-called Overseas Contingency Operations fund, which was established after the Sept. 11 attacks. It currently includes funding for the air campaign against ISIS, but also maintaining a presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. Initiatives to assist with counterterrorism efforts in the Middle East and NATO allies in Europe concerned about Russian aggression also come out of the OCO. The fund is controversial, because Congress and the White House have squabbled over using the OCO to pay for things normally covered by base funding, in order to get around the effects of sequestration. For 2016, the fund received about $58.8 billion, but the budget deal put about $9.1 billion in the OCO for things normally covered under base funding. That leaves $49.7 billion earmarked for waging war abroad, but the details of how that money is used is a bit murky in the appropriations bill. A clear picture won’t be available until the Defense Department releases its 2017 budget request in February. In the meantime, Heeley said, we can use President Barack Obama’s 2016 defense budget request to get an idea of how the money is allotted. Obama asked Congress for $5.3 billion to fight ISIS (slated to grow in 2017) and $42.5 billion for Afghanistan, largely to help fight al-Qaida. Using these figures with the Sanders campaign’s rough math, ignoring the military presence in Iraq or other counterterrorism operations, that would be a bit more than 9 percent. But here’s the thing: Policy experts said it’s hard to draw a tidy line between how much of the defense budget is for current operations and how much is for general readiness. The military needs its base budget in order to conduct the fighting for which the OCO was created. ""Capital investments in ships and planes are not included in OCO, yet you need them to launch Tomahawks and all other sorts of munitions,"" said Janine Davidson, senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Personnel and training also are not easy to parse. A C-17 could fly a mission around the world and only part of the week would be in support of (an) Afghanistan or ISIS fight."" Sanders’ math also doesn’t take into account counterterrorism efforts through other sources that don’t involve bombs or fighter jets, like the Justice or State departments. For example, the FBI’s Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence Decision Unit spent about $3.3 billion in 2015, and asked for about the same amount in 2016. The CIA and the National Security Agency also work to thwart terrorism. While we don’t know to what degree those agencies are funded, documents leaked by NSA contractor Edward Snowden showed that in 2013, more than $16 billion was spent to combat terrorism. ""Bernie is taking an extremely limited view of the defense budget here,"" Heeley said. ""While it may be true that the counterterrorism budget as a whole deserves a closer look, and would benefit from more transparency, it is not true that we're spending significantly less than 10 percent overall to fight international terrorism."" Our ruling Sanders said, ""Very little of (the defense) budget — less than 10 percent — actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism."" He’s getting that number by using a very limited view of the overall defense budget, pointing only to specific allotments in the budget for addressing ISIS and other terrorist threats. Experts told us that no matter what amounts are designated for that purpose, those operations draw from resources paid for in the base budget. There’s no clear way to separate the two. Sanders’ figure does refer to some specific funding but paints a misleading picture of overall defense spending. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/jan/18/bernie-sanders/less-10-percent-defense-budget-fighting-terrorism-/

Bernie Sanders exaggerates with claim that he helped write Obamacare
","Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sparred over health care policy during a debate in Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 17. At one point, Sanders rejected assertions by Clinton that a Sanders presidency could imperil President Barack Obama’s signature legislative initiative, the Affordable Care Act. Clinton said, ""There are things we can do to improve (the Affordable Care Act), but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction."" Sanders countered, ""We’re not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act. I helped write it."" We decided to check whether Sanders has a solid claim to have ""helped write"" the Affordable Care Act. As our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker have noted, Sanders pushed hard for a more liberal version of health care reform -- the American Health Security Act of 2009, which would have implemented a national single-payer system. (Under a single-payer system, the government, rather than private health insurers, pays all medical bills, along the lines of Medicare.) Sanders backed down after Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., used a procedural move to force a full reading of Sanders’ bill, a move that would have taken hours of floor time and imperiled passage of a more moderate bill backed by Obama and his allies. However, as negotiations were in their final stage, Sanders successfully pushed for the inclusion of $11 billion in funding for community health centers, especially in rural areas. The insertion of this funding helped bring together both Democratic lawmakers on the left and Democrats representing more conservative, rural areas. ""There was no one who played a more important role than Sen. Sanders"" in securing that funding, Daniel Hawkins, vice president of the National Association of Community Health Centers, told the Intercept last year. (Sanders’ camp forwarded PolitiFact the Intercept article as evidence for his statement.) So there’s a good case to be made that Sanders made an important contribution to the final legislation. Still, when Sanders says he ""helped write"" the bill, it would be reasonable to imagine that Sanders was an integral player in the crafting of the bill over a long period of time -- an insider in the process. And that’s not the reality. Before the final bill was enacted, Sanders and his allies on the party’s left flank regularly expressed frustration at the concessions they had to make during the legislative process. ""Public-option proponents, including Sanders and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, say they already have given up enough,"" Politico reported in late November 2009. ""They agreed to forgo a single-payer system. They decided not to push a government plan tied to Medicare rates. And they accepted (Harry) Reid's proposal to include the opt-out provision. That's it, they say."" Politico went on to quote Sanders saying, ""I have made it clear to the administration and Democratic leadership that my vote for the final bill is by no means guaranteed."" A few weeks later, Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank reported that Sanders was still undecided on supporting the primary Democratic bill. ""I am talking to the Democratic leadership, trying my best to salvage some positive things in this bill, so I am not on board yet."" And on Dec. 18, the New York Times quoted Sanders saying, ''I don't sleep well. I am struggling with this issue very hard, trying to sort out what is positive in this bill, what is negative in the bill, what it means for our country if there is no health insurance legislation, when we will come back to it. … And I have to combine that with the fact that I absolutely know that the insurance companies and the drug companies will be laughing all the way to the bank the day after this is passed.'' Sanders eventually voted for the legislation. Our ruling Sanders said he ""helped write"" the Affordable Care Act. He deserves credit for one provision of it -- worth a not-insignificant $11 billion. But overall, he was hardly an inside crafter of the bill. Until his effort was blocked by a GOP procedural move, Sanders supported a more aggressive single-payer system, and multiple news articles quoted him as being undecided about supporting the main Democratic bill until late in the process. Sanders’ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That meets our definition of Mostly False. UPDATE, March 28, 2016: After we published our story, Sanders’ staff provided PolitiFact with several additional examples of provisions the senator helped insert into the Affordable Care Act, sometimes with the cooperation of other lawmakers. According to his staff, these include $1.5 billion in mandatory spending for the National Health Service Corps, a negotiated rule-making process to redefine the criteria for designating medically underserved areas, a waiver for states that want to experiment on health care policy, a provision to double penalties for health care fraud, a provision strengthening the False Claims Act, language to make volunteer ambulance personnel and firefighters who perform emergency medical services eligible for grants and loans, a provision to ease payments to alternative medicine practitioners, higher funding levels for the Public Health and Prevention Fund, and a formula increase in Medicaid funding that benefited his home state of Vermont.  While this list does provide a more detailed picture of Sanders’ role in the bill’s crafting, none of these provisions involve core elements of the law, such as the exchanges and subsidies, the individual and employer mandates, the Medicaid expansion, the tax changes, the essential benefits package, and the provisions on cost containment. We stand by our original conclusion that, despite making contributions to the final legislation, Sanders was, for most of the process, an outsider pushing for a more aggressive single-payer system rather than an insider negotiating and crafting the final design of the bill. While saying that he ""helped write"" the Affordable Care Act contains an element of truth, Sanders ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. So we still rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/jan/18/bernie-sanders/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-claim-he-helped-write/

Hillary Clinton: 'We now have driven costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years'
","During the Jan. 17 Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Clinton argued against, as she put it, doing away with Obamacare and trying to replace it with the type of single-payer system her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, wants to implement. Attempts to do that when Democrats controlled the government failed, she noted, arguing that Obamacare has accomplished a lot. ""We have the Affordable Care Act. Let's make it work,"" Clinton said. ""We now have driven costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years. Now we've got to get individual costs down. That's what I'm planning to do."" Health care costs are the lowest in 50 years? That's probably news to consumers who keep seeing their premiums and copays going up. We decided to check the vital signs of this claim. We found that Clinton was incorrect. The actual per-person cost of health care has increased steadily over the last half-century, according to a 2013 White House report. When we contacted the Clinton campaign, spokesman Nick Merrill said what Clinton was actually talking about was the rate at which health care costs have been going up. ""Health care price inflation is at its lowest rate in 50 years,"" he said in an email, adding that it is ""currently running at just 1 percent on a year-over-year basis, the lowest level since January 1962."" He cited the same White House report from November 2013 to support that assertion. PolitiFact has touched on this issue before. During a 2012 president debate, President Barack Obama said that because of Obamacare, ""over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years."" We found that Obama's point about premiums was wrong, and gave him a False. But we did find, more to the point that Clinton's campaign says Clinton was trying to make, that health care spending at the time had grown slower than at any time in the previous 50 years. Those data come from 2009 and 2010, and preliminary estimates from 2011 were showing a similar trend. However, that may not be true anymore. More recent data from the Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, published in July 2015, also showed a recent increase, although the office appears to calculate its statistics differently. It reports that the per-person annual growth of all national health expenditures went from 3.3 percent in 2012, bottomed out at 2.9 percent in 2013, and were projected to grow to 4.7 percent in 2014. Because of the increases, according to the report, ""the health spending share of the economy is projected to rise from 17.4 percent in 2013 to 19.6 percent in 2024."" Our ruling Clinton said during the debate, ""We now have driven costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years."" Although the rate of growth has been at historic lows, the actual per-person cost of health care has increased steadily over the last half century. Only the rate of decline has slowed, a very different measure. The Clinton campaign acknowledges that the candidate misspoke. We rate her claim as False.",/factchecks/2016/jan/18/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-we-now-have-driven-costs-down-tgo-/

Occupy Democrats grossly twists Virginia school bathroom bill
","A left-leaning advocacy group says Del. Mark Cole, R-Spotsylvania, has introduced a bill that would require students to show their privates before using a restroom in a public school in Virginia. ""Virginia Republican wants schools to check children’s genitals before using bathroom,"" read the headline of a Jan. 12 web post by Occupy Democrats, a group started in 2012 to - in its own words - ""counterbalance the Republican Tea Party."" The ensuing article elaborated that Cole’s bill ""would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their ‘anatomical sex.’"" Similar claims have been posted on the websites of at least two other liberal groups: The Raw Story and Peacock Panache, triggering some Internet debate that isn’t exactly flattering to Cole. We wondered whether the description of Cole’s bill is accurate. School bathrooms have been a scalding issue in Cole’s district, where some parents have objected to a transgender student’s use of a girls’ lavatory at a Stafford County elementary school. Officials at the school initially allowed the student to use the girls’ room. But amid an outcry from some parents, the school board reversed that policy and instead directed the student to use a single-stall lavatory at the school, a staff bathroom, or the boys’ restroom. Cole’s bill would direct school boards across the state to develop policies to ensure that any public school restroom and locker room ""designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation."" The legislation defines ""anatomical sex"" as the ""physical condition of being male or female, which is determined by a person’s anatomy."" That measure, introduced Jan. 11, does not spell out exactly how school officials would verify a student’s gender. Colin Taylor, the managing editor of Occupy Democrats, and Omar Rivero, the group’s founder, told us in an email that the group ""simply took Del. Mark Cole’s offensive proposal to its logical conclusion."" ""How else would an enforcing official determine whether or not the individual's anatomical sex matches Del. Cole's interpretation of binary gender designation?"" they wrote. ""Are they expecting children or adults to voluntarily turn themselves in? Will they have to submit to inspection by a doctor? Somebody will have to inspect to prove that an individual is or is not anatomically correct.’"" But as our colleagues at the fact-checking website Snopes.com recently noted, there’s nothing in the bill explicitly calling for a genital inspection before students use the bathroom. There are, of course, other possibilities for verification, such as obtaining a doctor’s note, Snopes said. To clarify the matter, Cole introduced a second restroom bill Jan. 12 that calls for schools to verify a student’s ""biological sex"" by examining their birth certificate. Both his bills would carry a $50 civil fine for each violation by a student. Cole issued a written statement Jan. 13 accusing critics of mischaracterizing his bill, which he said attempts to provide clear policies on who can and can’t use a particular bathroom to shield school divisions from lawsuits. He said he introduced the bill at the request of parents in his district. ""Contrary to what has been said about the legislation, it does NOT require genital checks,"" Cole wrote. He said the legislation would be enforced only when there was a complaint about a student’s choice of bathrooms. ""If needed, gender could be verified by looking up student registration information or a birth certificate,"" he wrote. Cole told us on Jan. 15 that he will propose an amendment for his bill that will make it crystal clear it does not allow genital inspections. ""It would be, I think, blatantly unconstitutional for someone to conduct such a search,"" Cole said. Our ruling Occupy Democrats said Cole ""wants schools to check children’s genitals before using bathroom."" There is nothing in Cole’s bill that says students will be forced to show their private parts to school officials before they can use the restroom. The group defends its statement by saying ""it’s the logical conclusion"" of legislation that’s silent on how it would be enforced. But there are other possibilities the group doesn’t consider. Cole suggests using birth certificates and student records to verify a student’s anatomical gender. The loose writing of the bill, which Cole is trying to tighten, leaves the legislator a little bit open to criticism. But it doesn’t entitle Occupy Democrats to make up a genital inspection claim and attach Cole’s name to it. We rate the group’s claim False.",/factchecks/2016/jan/18/occupy-democrats/occupy-democrats-grossly-twists-virginia-school-ba/

Fact-checking Hillary Clinton's claim that Bernie Sanders supported 'Charleston Loophole'
","Trying to highlight an area where she is to the left of her opponent, Hillary Clinton attacked Bernie Sanders for his position on guns during the NBC-YouTube Democratic debate in Charleston, S.C. Guns are a particularly emotional topic in South Carolina after Dylann Roof was accused of killing nine African-Americans in a Charleston church in June. Sanders, a senator from Vermont, defended his record on guns saying that he ""supported from day one an instant background check to make certain that people who should not have guns do not have guns."" Clinton fired back at Sanders with a list of his votes on gun bills, including this one: ""He voted for what we call the ‘Charleston loophole.’ "" We wanted to know what Clinton meant by the ""Charleston loophole"" and if Sanders voted for it. Brady bill Clinton and some advocates for tighter gun laws argued Roof was abetted by the three-day time limit for background checks for gun purchases, dubbing it the ""Charleston loophole."" Supporters of gun rights say blame actually goes to the FBI and its botched paperwork. Under current federal law, the FBI performs background checks on would-be gun buyers in South Carolina and 29 other states through its National Instant Criminal Background Check System. (The rest of the states do their own background checks.) If the check isn’t denied or completed in three days, the gun seller can proceed with the sale. Roof was able to get a gun as a result of clerical errors. Roof tried to buy a handgun in West Columbia, S.C., on April 11. An FBI examiner found that Roof had been arrested for a drug charge March 1. Because the records didn’t show a conviction, the examiner couldn’t deny the purchase but continued to look into Roof’s criminal history. Roof’s rap sheet mistakenly listed the neighboring county’s sheriff office as the agency that arrested him, leading the FBI examiner to request more information from the wrong offices. When the three days were up, the case was still listed as ""pending"" and Roof was able to purchase the gun. Two months later, Roof allegedly shot and killed nine worshippers and injured one in a historically black church in Charleston. He faces trial on murder charges later this year. Those three days were at the heart of the the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which passed in 1993. A word about waiting periods: The Brady Bill didn’t contain a waiting period that required purchasers to wait to receive their firearm. (Some advocates like this idea, because they believe it might prevent impulsive acts of gun violence.) Rather, the bill set a time limit -- sometimes called a default to proceed -- for the government to conduct its background checks. Sanders, then in the U.S. House of Representatives, voted against the Brady Bill five times -- including a version that reinstated a five-day time limit for background checks. In November 1993, Sanders voted for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead. The problem was technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time. As a result, according to the Washington Post Fact-Checker, supporters of the Brady bill were forced to negotiate a compromise. What first was proposed as 10 days for the government to conduct the check ultimately was whittled to three days. The final compromise version of the Brady bill was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. It prohibited the transfer of a gun to an unlicensed individual, unless three business days have lapsed and the system has not notified the transferor that it would violate the law. Sanders voted against the final bill. Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver told us in July that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents. (We did not get a response from the Sanders’ campaign on debate night about Clinton’s attack.) So to recap: Sanders supported shortening the time the government had to conduct background checks. Whether extra time would have kept Roof from purchasing a gun is unclear. Clinton said that Sanders ""voted for what we call the Charleston loophole."" In 2015, Roof was able to buy a gun after time ran out for the government to perform a background check  -- the result of a clerical error when the FBI sought records from the wrong local law enforcement agency about Roof. Whether more time would have made a difference remains unknown. But Roof was able to purchase the gun after a three-day waiting period expired. Sanders voted in 1993 to shorten the time window for the government to conduct its check. Roof was able to purchase a gun after waiting out a three-day time limit on background checks. We rate this claim Mostly True. Clarification: This fact-check was edited on Jan. 19 to clarify waiting periods and and time limits on background checks.   ",/factchecks/2016/jan/18/hillary-clinton/fact-checking-hillary-clintons-claim-bernie-sander/

Hillary Clinton correct that Bernie Sanders flip-flopped on liability for gun makers, sellers
","In the increasingly competitive Democratic primary for president, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has spent months hammering Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for his vote on a 2005 bill that provided gun makers, sellers and trade associations with significant protection against lawsuits. Now, after Sanders clarified his position on the issue, she’s calling him a flip-flopper. Sanders, who represents the small, rural state of Vermont where guns are widely accepted, has sometimes sided with advocates of gun rights on key legislation and sometimes sided with supporters of gun control. One of the primary examples where Sanders broke with Democrats is in supporting the gun liability bill, which was enacted in 2005. A similar bill also passed the U.S. House in 2003. Sanders, then serving in the House, voted for it both times. Clinton called on Sanders to ""stand up and say I got this one wrong"" in a Jan. 8 interview on MSNBC’s Hardball.   About a week later, Sanders released a statement on the gun-liability issue in the run-up to the Jan. 17 Democratic debate in Charleston, S.C. In a news release, Sanders said, ""I’m pleased that this legislation is being introduced,"" referring to proposals by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to rescind portions of the 2005 law. ""As I have said for many months now, we need to look at the underlying law and tighten it up,"" Sanders added. The Clinton camp portrayed this as a flip-flop during the Charleston debate. Clinton said, ""I am pleased to hear that Sen. Sanders has reversed his position on immunity, and I look forward to him joining with those members of Congress who have already introduced legislation."" The Sanders camp disagreed that this was a change of position. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver had told MSNBC, ""This is not a flip flop, this is consistent with the position he held earlier in the campaign."" So is Clinton’s portrayal accurate? We took a closer look. Sanders’ vote on the 2005 bill While the bill includes two relatively non-controversial provisions -- one on trigger locks and the other on armor-piercing bullets -- the most contentious elements of the 2005 bill, and the ones that drove overwhelming Democratic opposition at the time, deal with liability for gun makers and sellers. The official bill summary provides for broad-based immunity for gun sellers, but it also provides a few exceptions, such as: • Cases where a person transfers a firearm knowing that a violent crime or drug-trafficking crime will be committed with it; • Cases where a seller is negligent or a manufacturer or seller knowingly violated the law; • And cases involving an injury caused by a physical defect with the weapon when it was used as intended. What Sanders and his campaign said prior to Jan. 16 On numerous occasions, Sanders or his aides have expressed comfort with his past vote. In June 2015, Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager, told Politico, ""I believe he would make the same vote"" today. In October, at a Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Sanders said, ""If somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and that murderer kills somebody with the gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible? Not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer. That is not what a lawsuit should be about."" Sanders continued to make similar arguments into January 2016. Asked by CBS whether gun manufacturers should be held accountable for gun deaths, Sanders said, ""Of course not, that doesn't make any sense,"" he said, while adding that if guns fall into the hands of criminals, ""Of course you hold the gun manufacturers liable."" At the same time, Sanders has increasingly fine-tuned his stance, saying he’d be open to reconsidering his vote on the 2005 measure. In an October 2015 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Sanders said he was ""willing to see changes"" in the gun-liability provision: ""Can we take another look at that liability issue? Yes."" Then, in January, a few days before the campaign issued its news release on gun liability, Sanders told a crowd in Iowa, ""I think we should take another look at that legislation and get rid of those provisions which allow gun manufacturers to act irresponsibly."" The Jan. 16 news release In the news release, Sanders expressed support for the Blumenthal-Schiff initiative to rescind the liability portions of the 2005 law. The trigger-lock and armor-piercing-ammunition provisions would not be overturned. The sponsors said they will try to advance the Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act as an amendment to an appropriations bill, according to the New York Times. On the Jan. 17 edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Sanders explained that in 2005, ""there were things in (the bill) that I did not like and I was willing to rethink. We have rethought it. There's a bill apparently being introduced, I like that bill, it makes some good changes and we will be supportive of it."" Sanders did say in his news release that he will be proposing an amendment to the Blumenthal and Schiff bills to require the Commerce Department to monitor and report on the law’s impact in rural areas on the availability of hunting supplies, including firearms, sold by non-negligent local gun stores. This, he indicated, was consistent with his past concerns about the threat of lawsuits against small gun shops serving primarily rural areas of Vermont. Our ruling So is Clinton right that Sanders flip-flopped on immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers? Sanders voted for the 2005 measure that provided broad liability exclusions for gunmakers and sellers. After months of Sanders and his staff defending the vote, Sanders’ position started to evolve in October. Sanders’ position three months ago -- that he would ""take another look"" at the liability question -- is consistent with his Jan. 16 news release saying he supported a proposal to rescind the immunity provisions. But to look back only to October doesn’t tell the full story, ignoring not only the 2003 and 2005 votes but also several instances in which Sanders or his staff defended those votes in interviews between June 2015 and early January 2016. That sounds like a flip-flop to us, so we rate Clinton’s statement True.",/factchecks/2016/jan/18/hillary-clinton/fact-checking-gun-manufacturer-liability-bernie/

Rubio wrongly credits Reagan for 1981 release of hostages from Iran
","As news of Iran’s release of American prisoners spread, Republicans were quick to deny President Barack Obama much credit for the deal. Presidential candidate Marco Rubio said the United States should not have made any concessions to Iran. Part of the deal included Obama granting clemency to seven Iranians charged in U.S. courts with violating economic sanctions against Iran. ""Our enemies now know that if you can capture an American, you can get something meaningful in exchange for it,"" Rubio said on Meet the Press on Jan. 17, 2016. Host Chuck Todd pressed Rubio on that position: ""So under President Rubio, you would not have negotiated any sort of prisoner exchange for those four American hostages?"" Rubio replied: ""When I become president of the United States, our adversaries around the world will know that America is no longer under the command of someone weak like Barack Obama, and it will be like Ronald Reagan, where as soon as he took office the hostages were released from Iran."" We flagged Rubio’s comment as a misleading framing of history. Reagan’s inauguration in 1981 may have coincided with the release of the hostages, but historians say it did not cause it. Instead, the Iranians had tired of holding the hostages, and that the administration of Jimmy Carter did the legwork to get the hostages released. We asked the Rubio campaign for response but did not hear back. The hostage crisis of 1979 It’s a GOP talking point we’ve debunked before. In 2012, Republican candidate Mitt Romney said, ""I believe the right course is what Ronald Reagan called peace through strength ... There's a reason why the Iranians released the hostages on the same day and at the same hour that Reagan was sworn in."" We rated his claim Pants on Fire.  In 1979, Islamic revolutionaries overthrew the Shah of Iran, who had been installed and supported by successive U.S. administrations. Militants took over the American embassy and held 52 American hostages from Nov. 4, 1979, until Jan. 20, 1981 -- the day Carter passed the reins to Reagan, who had defeated him amid widespread public disapproval of Carter’s handling of the crisis. But negotiations for the hostages’ release started well before Election Day. In September 1980, the Iranians contacted the Carter administration with a proposal, according to Gary Sick, a Columbia University professor and the author of October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan. The agreement that led to the release involved $11 billion to $12 billion in Iranian assets that Carter had frozen 10 days after the seizure of the U.S. embassy. Sick told us that the Iranians feared having to start negotiations over with a new administration and believed that they had extracted most of the benefits from holding the hostages. Carter informed Reagan at 8:31 a.m. that the release of the hostages was imminent, according to a contemporary report in the New York Times. ""The hostages, whose 14 months of captivity had been a central focus of the presidential contest last year, took off from Tehran in two Boeing 727 airplanes at 12:25 p.m., Eastern standard time, the very moment that Mr. Reagan was concluding his solemn Inaugural Address at the United States Capitol,"" its report says. Reagan announced the news at 2:15 p.m. at a luncheon with congressional leaders in the Capitol’s Statuary Hall. So Reagan, not Carter, got to bask in the glow of the hostages’ safe return. Despite the showy announcement, scholars of the period say that Reagan did not play any significant role in freeing the hostages. ""Well before Reagan became president, the deal for releasing the hostages had already been worked out by the Carter administration's State Department and the Iranians, ably assisted by Algerian diplomats,"" said David Farber, author of Taken Hostage: The Iranian Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with Radical Islam. No Reagan administration officials participated in the negotiations, Farber said, and the Iranians waited to officially release the Americans as a final insult to Carter, whom they despised. ""They believed Carter had betrayed the Iranian revolution by allowing the self-exiled Shah to receive medical attention in the United States and then had threatened their new government by attempting, unsuccessfully, to use military force in April 1980 to free the hostages,"" Farber said. Dave Houghton, a political scientist and author of U.S. Foreign Policy and the Iran Hostage Crisis, told PolitiFact that Iran had a relatively unsophisticated grasp of U.S. politics, and that it was possible that the Iranians ""didn’t even know what Reagan had said on the campaign trail."" ""I don't think they were scared into the release,"" Houghton said. ""In all likelihood, they released the hostages because they needed the sanctions we'd placed on them lifted so they could finance their war with Iraq."" Rubio’s comments are a misreading of history, said Michael Gunter, professor of political science at Tennessee Technological University, who has authored several papers on the 1981 hostage release. ""It is clear that Sen. Marco Rubio is falling back on an exaggerated urban legend that the only way to deal with Iran is through implied threats of military retaliation, as President Reagan supposedly did,"" he said. ""Actually, successful U.S. diplomacy then and now played the most significant role."" Our ruling Rubio said that Iranian hostages were released in 1981 as Reagan took office because Iran perceived that America was ""no longer under the command of someone weak."" In reality, Reagan’s foreign policy approach wasn’t a factor in the hostages’ release, as scholars told us. The Carter administration negotiated the deal months before Reagan’s inauguration, without involvement by Reagan or his transition team. Rubio’s claim is an imaginative re-reading of history.

Sanders: Obama was right, Clinton was wrong on Iran
","Recent positive developments in the United States’ relationship with Iran proves that President Barack Obama was right, and Hillary Clinton was wrong, said Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders. On Jan. 17, 2016, Obama announced that Iran released several American prisoners, among other diplomactic achievements, including a legal settlement over a military equipment dispute. NBC’s Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Sanders Jan. 17 if he thinks Iran is still an enemy of the United States. ""It’s funny,"" Sanders replied. ""If you think back to 2007 during the campaign in which Secretary Clinton ran against Barack Obama, she was critical of him. A question was asked to Obama that said, ‘Would you sit down and talk to the Iranians?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, I would."" Point being, you talk to your adversaries. You don’t run away from that. Secretary Clinton, I think, called him naive. Turns out that Obama was right."" Clinton and Obama’s back-and-forth on Iran and other foreign policy issues was a main feature of the 2008 Democratic primary. At one point, Clinton did call Obama’s position on Iran diplomacy ""naive,"" but Sanders is leaving out important nuance that misrepresents her position at the time. Fighting words This all started at a July 2007 Democratic presidential debate, where CNN took questions from YouTube users. One user asked, ""Would you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?"" Obama was the first to respond, saying, ""I would. And the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them, which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of (the George W. Bush) administration, is ridiculous."" (Obama made similar comments throughout the campaign.) Clinton also answered the question, saying she agreed that she would approach adversaries differently than the Bush administration and ""get back to diplomacy."" But she distinguished herself from Obama by saying she, as president, would not necessarily meet with these leaders in her first year, without any preconditions, which is what the YouTube question asked specifically. Instead, she would first send envoys. Clinton’s ""naive"" comment came the next day in an interview with the Quad-City Times in Iowa. ""I think it is wrong for any president to say he or she will not talk to people because they’re bad or evil,"" she said. ""But the question was very specific, asking whether either of us would talk to a list of leaders of five countries with which the United States has serious difficulties within the first year of becoming president, and I thought that was irresponsible and frankly naive to say he would commit to meeting with Chavez and Castro and others within the first year. As I said last night, there has to be a lot of diplomatic effort."" Sanders’ made it sound like Clinton shut the door on diplomacy, when in reality she was supportive of diplomacy, though she advocated for a more cautious approach than Obama. Competing memos from both campaigns emphasized this distinction, and the two candidates argued about it at another primary debate. At the time, we gave Obama a Mostly False rating for claiming that Clinton ""agrees with (John McCain) in embracing the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like."" Clinton clearly said she would approach diplomacy differently than the Bush administration. It’s worth noting that Obama did not personally meet with Iranian leaders in his first year. It wasn’t until 2013 that he spoke over the phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani — the highest-level talks between the two countries in 30 years. Obama did announce in April 2009, four months into his first term, that the United States and five other countries would engage in talks with Iran — the P5+1 group that eventually negotiated the nuclear deal. For her part, Clinton as secretary of state was personally involved in diplomatic efforts to increase global sanctions on Iran that helped move the nuclear deal forward. Our ruling Sanders said that Clinton called Obama ""naive"" for saying he was would ""sit down and talk to the Iranians"" during the 2008 Democratic primary. This is a simplified description of the back-and-forth between Clinton and Obama. Both candidates said they supported more diplomacy between Iran and the United States than what the Bush administration had pursued. Clinton’s position differed from Obama’s in that she supported a slower approach, starting with lower-level talks. Obama, on the other hand, said he would be willing to meet with Iranian leaders in his first year as president, without preconditions. It was Obama’s approach to diplomacy with Iran that she called naive, not the idea of pursuing diplomatic relations in general. Ultimately, Obama did not meet himself with Iranian leaders in his first year.

Superman developer on why he needs subsidies
","After another year of vacancy for the iconic downtown high-rise known as the Superman building, Providence Journal columnist Edward Fitzpatrick had a question for the owners of the building at 111 Westminster St.: Why do they think they can’t redevelop the landmark without aid from taxpayers? The building’s principal owner, David C. Sweetser, fielded the question with help from Bill Fischer, a Rhode Island lobbyist who serves as a spokesman for the Massachusetts-based company that Sweetser founded, High Rock Development LLC. A major component of their answer involved a comparison of the development environment in Boston and Providence. In his column, Fitzpatrick wrote that Sweetser, of Wellesley, Massachusetts, told him that Boston is just 60 minutes away and it’s offering subsidies to developers who can charge higher rent than developers can get in Providence while construction costs are more or less equal. As a result, Sweetser told Fitzpatrick, the Boston skyline is ""completely dominated by cranes."" The statement from Sweetser, who wants tens of millions in public aid, seems to suggest that Providence would see more construction if it could provide sufficient help to offset lower rents. We set out to break down the claim. Our first stop was subsidies. Is Boston giving them to developers? Fischer referred us to the Boston Redevelopment Authority. The authority’s spokesman, Nicholas Martin, confirmed that yes, Boston gives subsidies, in the form of tax relief, to certain ""impactful"" projects. One prominent example is the $25 million in property tax relief offered to General Electric, which is moving its headquarters to Boston from Connecticut. There are other smaller-scale examples. However, lots of projects in Boston, including many with derricks swiping the skyline, are not getting subsidies, said Martin. ""I would not hesitate to say that the majority of construction that’s going on in the city of Boston is not subsidized,"" Martin said. (It should be noted that Sweetser never said that all, or most, Boston projects get subsidies.) The disparity between rents in Providence and Boston was next on our list. Can Boston developers, the same ones getting subsidies, charge more than developers can charge in Providence? Yes. This is well-known. Two sources that Fischer provided highlight the disparity. Researchers at Transwestern recently calculated average rent per square foot for Boston’s ""Class A"" office space at $52.  Transwestern is a global real estate services company that provides research on office space for Boston and New York, but not Providence. A 2015 analysis by MG Commercial, which sells and leases commercial real estate in Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts, says Class-A office space in Providence ranges from $25 to $32 per square foot. CBRE is another worldwide firm that provides real estate services, including market research for both Boston and Providence. CBRE’s market outlook for 2015 showed Class-A office space in Boston ranging from $53 per square foot to almost $63 while asking rents for Class-A properties in Providence were about $31 per square foot. Now we needed to check on construction costs. We reached out to Gilbane Building Co. an international construction company based in Providence. At our request, the construction firm’s Rhode Island team leader, John Sinnott, analyzed construction cost data from the MS Means City Cost Index, a standard industry tool. ""While there is a slight overall difference in costs between Boston and Providence — when it comes to larger more complex projects costs are roughly the same,"" said Sinnott. A rehab of the Superman building would be in the larger, more complex category. We were finally near the end, the part about cranes ""dominating the skyline."" There are so many that the Boston Business Journal has a ""Crane Watch"" graphic on its web site. The current graphic lists more than 85. Our ruling When he was asked why he needs public aid to do something with the Superman building, Sweetser pointed to the boom in Boston and cited a number of factors for it: Boston’s higher rents, comparable construction costs and subsidies. As a result, the Boston skyline is ""completely dominated by cranes,"" Sweetser said. Because Sweetser wants subsidies and says he can’t begin work on the old Industrial National Bank Building without them, it’s hard not to focus on subsidies when thinking about the two cities, even though many projects in Boston aren’t getting them. He could have said more simply: Boston’s skyline is filled with cranes because its economy is booming. As a result, Boston rents, a reliable economic indicator, are appreciably higher than those in Providence. The Boston real estate market is responding to that demand with lots of new construction. We rate his claim as True. ",/factchecks/2016/jan/17/david-sweetser/superman-developer-why-he-needs-subsidies/

Jeb. Bush says there are no homeless veterans in Houston
","At a campaign stop in West Palm Beach on Dec. 28, 2015, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush answered questions about immigration, gun control and his candidacy for president. After his speech to an audience of Florida Republicans at the Forum Club of Palm Beaches, Bush was asked, ""If elected president, what would you and your administration do to improve veterans’ medical benefits?"" Bush said he would institute career civil service reform at the Veterans Administration, lead the VA to focus on ""being world class for a few selected unique challenges veterans face"" rather than providing all services, and give veterans more choices on where to go for their health care. Then, Bush brought up his childhood home, Houston. ""Can I make another point? I want to tout something,"" he told the crowd. ""Three months ago I was in Houston, Texas, and a guy who I met woke up one day and he said, ‘I do not want to see a homeless veteran on the streets of Houston.’ He’s a successful guy – he had the resources to draw people towards this cause. ""And in Houston, Texas, today, there are no homeless veterans,"" Bush said. This program, Bush said, was an example of the effectiveness of ""bottom-up government."" ""They didn’t wait for a federal government to create a program,"" he said of Houston. ""They didn’t wait for Washington to do anything.

In 2009, as part of a broader initiative on homelessness, President Barack Obama announced a plan to end veteran homelessness nationwide by 2015 -- a goal that wasn’t entirely fulfilled, according to a June 2015 Houston Chronicle news story. So, did Houston wipe out homelessness among veterans, even if the country didn’t? Bush made us wonder. Effectively ending veteran homelessness Although the federal government began its initiative on veteran homelessness in 2009, Houston didn’t begin its push in earnest until June 2012 with ""Housing Houston’s Heroes,"" a program with the initial goal to house 100 homeless veterans in 100 days, according to staff in the Mayor’s Office for Homeless Initiatives. Communities around the country tally their homeless populations with a ""point-in-time count"" each January. In January 2012, five months before it began targeting veteran homelessness, Houston counted 7,187 homeless residents, including 1,162 veterans. In January 2015, the city counted 4,609 homeless residents, including 563 veterans. The city has housed many of those veterans in the months since, but does not have a more recent count, according to the Mayor’s Office for Homeless Initiatives. In January 2015, according to the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, an estimated 47,725 veterans nationwide were homeless, down 36 percent since 2010, shortly after Obama declared the federal initiative. ""Veterans experience homelessness for many of the same reasons that non-veterans do,"" the council says, but exposure to combat and repeated deployments as well as high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, brain injury and sexual trauma among veterans can make homelessness more likely. Generally, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness defines ending homelessness as having ""a systematic response in place that ensures homelessness is prevented whenever possible, or if it can’t be prevented, it is a rare, brief and non-recurring experience."" A Bush campaign spokeswoman, Allie Brandenburger, when asked the basis of Bush’s Houston claim, pointed us to news and advocacy articles including a list posted Dec. 7, 2015 by U.S. Uncut, a liberal advocacy group, naming Houston as one of seven cities and states that as of December 2015 were housing their chronically homeless veterans. The list was based on news reports and press releases from cities around the country on their work on homeless initiatives. Bush’s camp didn’t answer our questions about Bush’s broader anecdote--particularly who he was singling out as the hero in his description of a ""successful guy"" who used his influence to stamp out homelessness for Houston’s veterans. When we inquired, Carl Salazar, director of Houston’s Office of Veterans Affairs, by phone said Bush’s story sounded ""fictional."" Salazar said Houston’s work on veteran homelessness brought together nonprofit groups as well as city, county, state and federal officials. Brandenburger’s reply also noted December 2015 articles from the Christian Science Monitor, the Huffington Post and the Philadelphia Citizen that mentioned Houston as one of a handful of cities, including New Orleans, Salt Lake City, Philadelphia and Phoenix, that effectively had ended veterans’ homelessness. Houston actions For Houston, at least, reports of an end to veterans’ homelessness appear to have been based on then-Houston Mayor Annise Parker announcing in a June 2015 press release: ""The Houston region has come together as a team to transform our homeless response system to effectively end veteran homelessness."" The city celebrated the achievement at the time at a press conference where Parker was joined by three Cabinet secretaries who praised Houston’s work. We wondered about the details. According to staff at the Mayor’s Office for Homeless Initiatives, the mayor’s mention of effectively ending veteran homelessness means the city had corralled the resources to house and prevent homelessness for veterans in need.  The program is focused on ""permanent supportive housing,"" which uses grant funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide rental assistance for apartment units, according to Sean Quitzau, an assistant in the Mayor’s Office for Homeless Initiatives. The initiative works with the landlords who oversee these rental units, and allocates its resources to apartments, rather than shelters. As of November 2015, the Houston program, renamed ""The Way Home,"" had housed 4,114 veterans since 2012, Quitzau said. (Quitzau first checked with Mandy Chapman Semple, the special assistant to the mayor for homeless initiatives, who leads that office.) Houston, the fourth-largest city in the country, has the second-largest veteran population, with 300,000 veterans living there, the city said in its release. The initiative on veteran homelessness was a partnership between 35 local agencies. ‘No homeless veterans’  Houston officials agreed that ""effectively"" ending veteran homelessness by having the resources to house any veteran who needs assistance doesn’t mean that there are no homeless veterans in Houston. Salazar, in the city’s Office of Veterans Affairs, confirmed that when we asked about Bush’s comments. ""It’s true there are not that many homeless veterans on the streets of Houston,"" Salazar said by phone. ""While it’s nice Jeb Bush touted all the work we’re still doing in Houston, it’s not true there are no homeless veterans here. There are definitely homeless veterans. It’s a moving target."" The Mayor’s Office for Homeless Initiatives, which tracks such statistics, couldn’t offer an exact number for how many veterans remain homeless. The office did say that 900 Houston veterans experience housing instability every year and 50 veterans at any given time are moving through the city’s system on their way to being housed. Veterans who remain on the street, Salazar said, generally are there for up to three reasons: -- Some choose to stay on their own, usually because they have lived in shelters before and do not like the structure of those environments, or object to assisted living they are required to have there. -- Some don’t qualify for services because of prior offenses or records as sex offenders, usually for offenses that occurred after they completed military service. For the homeless with histories as sex offenders, even if they do qualify for services, it can be hard to get a landlord’s approval to be placed in an apartment complex. And veterans who were discharged from the military with bad conduct may not qualify for some of the VA services available, though a bad conduct discharge generally will not disqualify a veteran from all services for the homeless. -- And some who fall into homelessness for the first time, rather than being chronically homeless, aren’t aware of the resources available and fall through the cracks. Our ruling  Bush said that ""In Houston, Texas today, there are no homeless veterans."" Houston is one of a handful of cities nationwide that have ""effectively"" ended veteran homelessness by revamping their resources and systems to handle all veterans who seek support. The city’s success in that regard has been measured by benchmarks set by national and local initiatives on homelessness.   Being equipped to provide housing for all homeless veterans doesn’t mean that every veteran is housed. Some remain homeless in Houston, whether by choice, a lack of awareness of housing resources or eligibility. We rate Bush's statement Mostly False. Mostly False: The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",/factchecks/2016/jan/15/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-there-are-no-homeless-veterans-houst/

While blaming Scott Walker, Democrats err in saying Wisconsin's ACT rank dropped from 2nd to 41st
","For years, Wisconsin leaders have expressed pride in how the state’s high school students perform on the ACT exam, which assesses students’ academic readiness for college. From 2008 through 2014, with Minnesota ranking first, Wisconsin has battled, usually with Iowa, for second or third. That is, among states where more than half of the students take the ACT. So, it was a surprise on Jan. 14, 2016 when the Wisconsin Democratic Party issued a news release declaring that Wisconsin’s ACT rank had plunged to near the bottom. ""Newly released information from the (Wisconsin) Department of Instruction shows a dramatic decline in student ACT results in the past year,"" the news release stated, blaming Republican Gov. Scott Walker. ""Test scores dropped Wisconsin from second in the country to 41st in the nation among states where more than half the students took the exam."" Such a free-fall should have produced blaring headlines. But there was not even a mention of a 41st ranking in stories by Wisconsin’s leading news organizations about the scores, which had been announced a day earlier by the Department of Public Instruction. It turns out the Democratic Party came up with 41st on its own -- by mixing apples and oranges. Scores announced What made headlines from the announcement by the Department of Public Instruction were scores by younger students on a different test, the Badger Exam. More than half of Wisconsin's public school students in grades three through eight -- 51.2 percent -- were proficient or advanced in English language arts in 2014-’15, and 43.7 percent did as well in math. Meanwhile, the department’s release of the ACT scores got lesser billing in the news reports. That release stressed that the 2014-’15 school year marked the first time in Wisconsin that all juniors (11th grade) in public high schools had the opportunity to take the test. That’s because testing fees were paid by the state. In other words, the more than 64,000 juniors comprised a unique group in terms of Wisconsin students who have taken the ACT over the years. Traditionally, when state rankings on the ACT are done, the scores are for graduating seniors -- and include students from private as well as public high schools. Now to the scores. The ACT -- which tests in English, reading, writing, math and science -- is scored on a scale of 1 to 36. Wisconsin’s composite score for the public school 11th-graders for 2014-’15 was 20, according to the department’s news release. But the way to think about that score is a baseline. There won’t be a score to compare it to until the next set of public school 11th-graders takes the test. Meanwhile, the composite for the more than 46,000 graduating seniors -- the group whose scores are traditionally used to rank the states -- was higher: 22.2. The department made a point to state that comparisons between the two scores -- given that they are for two different groups of students -- are ""invalid and flawed."" But that’s what the Democratic Party did in its news release. The party took the 20 score for Wisconsin’s juniors and plugged it into the ACT database that compares state scores for graduating seniors. That database clearly shows that Wisconsin’s score for the traditional group, the graduating seniors in 2014-’15, was 22.2 (the same score as the previous year). The new score put Wisconsin, once again, second among states where more than half of the graduating seniors took the ACT -- behind Minnesota, which had a score of 22.7. Among all states, Wisconsin’s 22.2 ranked 18th. But the Democratic Party, using the 20 score for the group of juniors, said that score meant Wisconsin tied with Kentucky for 41st place. A spokesman for the ACT told us the party’s claim ""cannot be supported"" because it is ""not an apples to apples comparison."" And when we shared that with Brandon Weathersby, spokesman for the Democratic Party, he acknowledged the party had ""flubbed"" the data.   Our rating The state Democratic Party said Wisconsin dropped ""from second in the country to 41st"" among states where more than half the students took the ACT college preparation exam. The party admits it erred, by comparing scores of two different groups of students. In fact, Wisconsin ranked second in the 2014-’15 ACT testing among states where more than half the students took the exam, not 41st. For a statement that is false and ridiculous, our rating is Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2016/jan/15/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/blaming-scott-walker-democrats-say-wisconsins-rank/

Ted Cruz misfires on Feinstein gun claim
","LISTEN TO THIS STORY:  Texas Senator Ted Cruz repeated a false claim about California Senator Dianne Feinstein and guns during Thursday night’s GOP presidential candidates debate in South Carolina. Cruz said at the debate: ""California Senator, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, 'Give me your guns, I'm rounding 'em up,' she would.""  Cruz's claim is at the 9:30 minute mark in the video above. The Texas Republican made a nearly identical claim Jan. 7 in a CNN interview. We ruled it false. In that interview, Cruz told CNN: ""I’ll tell you who I do take at her word is Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who said: ‘If I could go to Mr. America, Mrs. America, and say, hand over your guns, I want all of your guns, I would do it.’"" We focused on Cruz's provocative comments that Feinstein said she wanted Americans to ""hand over your guns, I want all your guns."" We learned Cruz took a statement Feinstein made in 1995 about the assault weapons ban she authored far, far out of context. No love lost Cruz and Feinstein are about as far apart on gun rights as any politicians in Washington D.C. The senators famously sparred in 2013, during Feinstein’s unsuccessful attempt to pass a revamped assault weapons ban. At a Senate hearing, the longtime California senator accused Cruz of giving her a ""lecture"" on constitutional rights. ""I’m not a sixth grader,"" Feinstein told Cruz, during a terse exchange. ""I come from a different place than you. I respect your views. I ask you to respect my views."" Cruz had suggested Feinstein was trying to pick apart the Second Amendment, in a way she would never try with the First or Fourth Amendments. Cruz is among the biggest gun rights backers in the GOP presidential candidate field. As Texas solicitor general, he led a successful fight before the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a Washington D.C. gun ban in 2008. His defense of the Second Amendment has continued this winter in stump speeches from New Hampshire to Nevada.  Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) meets with attendees Tuesday, Jan. 12, 2016, during a campaign stop at Granite State Indoor Range in Hudson, N.H. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Feinstein on guns Feinstein, by contrast, is considered a leader on gun control. In 1994, she authored the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which was signed by President Bill Clinton. It prohibited the manufacture of 19 specific kinds of military-style, semi-automatic firearms, often called assault weapons. It also banned the manufacture and sale of gun magazines that hold more than 10 bullets. The bill expired in 2004 after efforts to extend it failed in Congress. Its restrictions did not apply to any semi-automatic weapons or magazines made before the ban’s effective date: Sept. 13, 1994. Video of Feinstein’s comment In an interview with 60 Minutes that aired in February 1995, correspondent Lesley Stahl asked Feinstein about this loophole, which made it legal to buy and sell hundreds of thousands of the assault weapons the senator had sought to restrict. Feinstein responded: ""If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, ‘Mr. and Mrs. America turn ‘em all in,’ I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren’t here.’"" Cruz’s campaign spokesman pointed to this statement when we asked him to back up the presidential hopeful’s claim. It’s available on YouTube as a short excerpt of the longer 60 Minutes piece.   The YouTube video makes it clear that the interview is about the assault weapons ban. The term ""assault weapon"" is uttered in the first sentence, just as the video clip shows Feinstein hoisting up a semiautomatic weapon at a press conference. Nowhere in the short piece or the full interview does Feinstein discuss banning ""all guns"" as Cruz claimed. Feinstein does say in the TV interview that she wanted to ban all assault weapons, regardless of when they were made. She again made that point in a speech on the U.S. Senate floor several months after the 60 Minutes interview, in December 1995: ""If I had my way, I would ban the possession of assault weapons anywhere in the United States of America, but there were not going to be the votes for that,"" she said, according to a transcript in the Congressional Record. Feinstein has outlined her support for legal gun ownership in many ways, including during the effort to renew the assault weapons ban. ""Let me be clear: If an individual wants to purchase a weapon for hunting or self-defense, I support that right,"" Feinstein wrote in an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle in July 2012. Our ruling Cruz has claimed multiple times that Feinstein stated her desire to tell Americans ""I want all of your guns,"" or ""I'm rounding 'em up."" When asked to show evidence of the claim, Cruz’s spokesman pointed to a short segment of a 60 Minutes piece that centered on Feinstein’s assault weapons ban from two decades ago. While Feinstein calls for an ""outright ban"" in the excerpt, a reasonable look at that sound bite, and a transcript of the full 60 Minutes interview, shows Feinstein is not referring to banning ""all guns."" Instead, she’s relaying that she failed to achieve her desired full ban on assault weapons. The full TV segment details a large loophole in the law that allows the sale and purchase of assault weapons made before the ban went into effect. Feinstein’s statement is clearly in response to concerns over that loophole. We rate Cruz’s claim False.",/factchecks/2016/jan/15/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-misfires-feinstein-gun-claim/

Rubio mischaracterizes Cruz's statement on birthright citizenship
","Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz picked up their immigration battle at another presidential debate, with Rubio accusing his rival of flip-flopping on a laundry list of positions, including birthright citizenship. ""You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship. Now you say that you are against it,"" Rubio said as Cruz vigorously shook his head. The question takes on special significance in this case, since Cruz, born in Canada to an American mother and Cuban father, has had his own American citizenship questioned by frontrunner Donald Trump. We decided to check if Cruz has changed his political position on whether the children of immigrants should be American citizens if they are born in the United States. We found Cruz has shifted his talk about birthright citizenship, but it’s not in the way Rubio described on national television. Campaign comments When we asked Rubio’s campaign about the accusation, they sent us a list of attacks about Cruz allegedly switching positions on a host of issues. But the claim boils down to a 2011 radio interview on The Duke Machado Show during Cruz’s Senate campaign. The show’s host asked Cruz whether the issue of birthright citizenship in the 14th Amendment should be changed. The amendment states, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside."" Now, Cruz didn’t offer outright support for birthright citizenship. Cruz, a former prosecutor, said it would be difficult to revisit the provision. ""The 14th Amendment provides for birthright citizenship. I’ve looked at the legal arguments against it, and I will tell you as a Supreme Court litigator, those arguments are not very good,"" he said. ""As much as someone may dislike the policy of birthright citizenship, it’s in the U.S. Constitution. And I don’t like it when federal judges set aside the Constitution because their policy preferences are different. ""And so in my view I think it is a mistake for conservatives to be focusing on trying to fight what the Constitution says on birthright citizenship. I think we are far better off focusing on securing the border, because birthright citizenship wouldn’t be an issue if we didn’t have people coming in illegally."" The full interview isn’t available, so we can’t say what else Cruz may have said on the subject during the 2011 broadcast. Pressed to clarify his view during the current presidential campaign, Cruz gave a series of interviews in August 2015 to show he opposed the practice. ""We should end granting automatic birthright citizenship to the children of those who are here illegally,"" Cruz said in an Aug. 19 radio interview on ""The Michael Medved Show."" Medved asked if Cruz would change the Constitution if he could: ""I think that it is possible, but any constitutional amendment, by its nature, is difficult to achieve. Look, I would note, that has been my position from the very first day of my running for the Senate."" Cruz repeated his position Aug. 23 on Face the Nation, saying while he is against giving the kids of undocumented immigrants citizenship, the real problem is a matter of preventing illegal immigration with better border security. ""I think birthright citizenship as a policy matter doesn't make sense,"" Cruz said. ""We have right now upwards of 12 million people living here illegally. It doesn't make any sense that our law automatically grants citizenship to their children because what it does is it incentivizes additional illegal immigration."" Two days later, he told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly that birthright citizenship is an incentive for undocumented immigrants to come to America and that ""we ought to change that policy"" but that ""there is a legal dispute about the best means to do it."" ""There are serious scholars who argue that Congress could do it through statute defining what it means to be subject to the jurisdiction, the language of the 14th Amendment,"" he said. ""There are other serious constitutional scholars who argue the only way to change it is through a constitutional amendment. My view is, we should pursue either or both, whichever is effective; What matters is that we should change the policy so we are not rewarding and incentivizing and encouraging more illegal immigration."" Is it a flip-flop? Some conservative media outlets, and Rubio, have said this amounts to a ""flip-flop"" for Cruz. But it’s not that straight-forward. At most, Cruz said in 2011 he didn’t think changing the 14th Amendment was feasible from a legal standpoint, and conservatives would be better off focusing on securing the borders. We couldn’t find any statements by Cruz that showed anything resembling support for birthright citizenship, and we don’t read his resistance to fighting a constitutional amendment as support for the concept in the way his critics do. That said, there has been a shift on one thing: Cruz now says he supports pursuing a change, either with an amendment or legislation. Cruz’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment by deadline. Our ruling Rubio said Cruz used to be ""in favor of birthright citizenship"" but is now against it. He was referring to a 2011 radio interview in which Cruz said birthright citizenship was guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, and it was better for conservatives to focus on border security instead of trying to change the Constitution. He has since insisted he opposed birthright citizenship then and opposes it now. We can’t find evidence that contradicts him. Cruz apparently changed his mind on at least one thing: He has said he now supports Congress pursuing a way to change the policy. While that raises questions on some details about Cruz’s position, it’s different than what Rubio claimed. We rate Rubio’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/jan/15/marco-rubio/rubio-mischaracterizes-cruzs-statement-birthright-/
