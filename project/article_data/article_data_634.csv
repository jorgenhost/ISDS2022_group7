Dan Patrick says almost 500 of 8,000 Texas public schools have been rated unacceptable
","
State Sen. Dan Patrick says so many Texas schools lag that lawmakers should widen school choices, feeding speculation that he will champion changes helping students transfer to private schools.

The Houston Republican, chairman of the Senate Education Committee, has not spelled out a proposal. But he asked a Democratic colleague, Sen. Kirk Watson of Austin,  to join his cause during a Nov. 8, 2012, joint public interview with the Texas Tribune.

Patrick said: ""I am willing to join you and do whatever it takes to give people an opportunity to succeed. But I need the Democrats also to join me and not draw a line in the sand, that money is the only thing that’s going to turn a school around.

""If a student is in a failing school through no fault of their own — we have 8,000 campuses in Texas, almost 500 campuses are rated unacceptable — it should be unacceptable to every Republican, every Democrat in the state, every voter in the state, to say to a child you’re going to succeed even though we’re forcing you to go to a failing school,"" Patrick said.

Watson replied that he would read Patrick’s plan when it is finalized.

And are nearly 500 of 8,000 Texas public schools rated unacceptable?

Seems so.

In 2011, according to information posted online by the Texas Education Agency, 496 of 8,526 Texas campuses (5.8 percent) were rated academically unacceptable by the state education agency. No campus or district accountability ratings were issued in 2012; the agency says a revised system is intended to tie ratings to indicators including results on the student exams being phased in, the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness.

So, Patrick nailed the number of campuses rated unacceptable while slightly understating the total number of campuses.

According to an agency chart showing the 2011 figures, the nearly 6 percent of campuses marked as unacceptable in 2011 greatly exceeded comparable counts for previous years. From 2004 through 2010, the previous highest number of ""unacceptable"" campuses was 267 of 7,956 campuses, or 3.4 percent, in 2006, the chart indicates  In 2010, it says, 84 of 8,435 campuses (1 percent) drew the dismal rating.

According to news accounts including a July 30, 2011, article in the Austin American-Statesman, the five-fold increase in academically unacceptable campuses from 2010 to 2011 swept in several Austin middle schools and LBJ High School.

And why the statewide surge? School administrators attributed it to changes in passing standards for the then-prevalent state test, the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills, the Statesman reported. The state also required a larger share of students to pass the TAKS than before and took into account more scores from special-education students, the story says.

State education officials also had decided to drop a performance measure that kept some schools from being low-rated.

A Houston Chronicle news story published the same day quoted an education agency spokeswoman, Debbie Ratcliffe, as saying the plunge in ratings was largely due to the state no longer using a statistical measure that gave credit for failing test scores if the students were on track to pass in coming years. ""It's very important for parents to remember that the standards substantially increased this year,"" Ratcliffe said.

In the Houston school district, the Chronicle reported, state-determined ""unacceptable"" campuses more than tripled to 25 — or 9 percent of its rated schools. The Dallas district experienced more than a doubling in campuses rated as unacceptable, going from 14 to 33, according to a Dallas Morning News article posted online July 29, 2011.

By email, Graves told us the Texas Performance Measure not used for the 2011 ratings had given schools and districts credit for making progress, even if insufficient students reached required passing levels on the TAKS.

The Morning News story quotes Robert Scott, then the state’s education commissioner, as saying his April 2011 decision to discontinue the performance factor meant there ""will no longer be any allegations that we are pumping up the numbers. The numbers are real this year.""

Next, we wondered how each school drew its low rating.

Of the campuses rated academically unacceptable, the agency says in a 2011 highlights summary, 479 experienced poor performance on the TAKS alone with remaining campuses getting the rating mostly due to a combination of factors.

Ratcliffe emailed us an agency chart indicating that 159 campuses were rated unacceptable for student performance on the math TAKS alone. The next-most frequent reason, for 81 campuses getting the rating, was too many students failing the state’s math and science tests. The chart lists 29 other reasons for one campus or more being rated unacceptable.

By phone, Ratcliffe told us that a large, diverse high school can be rated academically unacceptable if enough students fail to meet state expectations across any of more than 30 sub-categories ranging from different subject-matter tests to completion, graduation or dropout rates across sub-groups of students broken out by race or whether they come from low-income families.

For instance: Austin’s LBJ High drew its unacceptable rating because not enough African American students passed the math TAKS, according to a state posting. Some 144 of 260 African American students, or 55 percent, met the math standard, according to the post. By our calculation, if 15 additional African American students had passed that test, the school would have been rated academically acceptable.

Finally, there is at least one other way of gauging progress in individual schools. In August 2012, the state announced that about half of all Texas campuses statewide failed to meet federal standards based on the No Child Left Behind Act, as the Statesman said in an Aug. 9, 2012, news article. More Austin-area schools than ever also missed the mark because of tougher passing standards, the Statesman said.

Our ruling

Patrick’s claim, that almost 500 of the state’s 8,000 campuses are rated unacceptable, reflects the 2011 Texas ratings--and fresh ratings aren’t expected until 2013. We rate the statement as True.",/factchecks/2012/nov/14/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-almost-500-8000-texas-public-scho/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Robin Vos']","
Vos says on income taxes, Wisconsin is one of easiest for the poor and hardest for the middle class
","
It’s one of Madison’s worst-kept secrets: Republicans at the Capitol want to cut state income taxes, and hope to take up the issue in the 2013 legislative session, which begins in January.

The question is: Cut them for who?

On that, it’s a good idea to listen to Rep. Robin Vos, the Republican from Rochester who was elected Nov. 13, 2012 as speaker of the state Assembly.

Vos made clear in a recent WisPolitics interview that his top priority is a middle-class income tax cut.

""If you’re poor in Wisconsin, it is one of the best places in the country to be poor. We’re in the bottom 10 states as far as paying taxes if you’re poor,"" Vos said in the interview. ""If you’re successful, we are in the middle. I think we’re number 15 or 16 ...""

""But if you’re a person in the middle class, somebody who makes $20,000 to $200,000, you’re in the top 4 or 5 worst places in the country to be a middle-class income taxpayer.""

Vos went on to tell WisPolitics that Republicans want an across-the-board income-tax cut, though the ""primary benefits"" would go to the middle class. When we asked him to clarify what he meant, he told us fiscal constraints might preclude -- for now -- reducing income tax rates on upper-income earners for whom legislative Democrats and Gov. Jim Doyle raised the top rate in 2010.

So, is Vos right about how the income tax burden affects low and middle-income earners?

When asked for backup, Vos pointed us to research presented to the bipartisan Steering Committee on Income Tax, a study group chaired by Vos that was set up through the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council.

Lower-income workers: Vos said their income tax burden is in the bottom 10, and it’s clear from the complete interview he meant among the 41 states that levy a personal income tax.

In a November 2009 study, the nonpartisan, liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) ranked the burden on the lowest one-fifth of Wisconsin’s earners as the 29th-lowest among those 41 states.

That’s not quite bottom 10, but the group’s executive Matthew Gardner told us the difference between Wisconsin and the lowest rung of the bottom 10 was so ""trivially small"" as to be meaningless.

Another 50-state study, by the Minnesota Taxpayers Association in 2011, ranked the low-income burden in Wisconsin as either 32nd- or 34th-lowest for married couples at $10,000 or $20,000. Both are bottom 10.

In Wisconsin, as in several other states, the working poor often have a ""negative"" income tax bill -- they get tax credits that wipe out their tax liability and in some cases result in a payment to them from the state.

Wisconsin would be lower in these rankings, but some states pay even larger credits.

Middle-income earners: Vos said this group faces a top-five burden.

Income taxes paid by Wisconsin married couples and single heads of household in the $75,000 to $100,000 income range are fifth-highest in the country, based on the Minnesota study. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue indirectly cited the Minnesota study in testimony before the Vos-chaired study group.

A sub-group of all married couples -- senior couples making $100,000 -- have the fourth-highest.

The Minnesota group’s research director, Aaron Twait, said he considers the $100,000 mark for two earners a classic middle-class household, based on average incomes in Wisconsin and Minnesota.

In addition, the ITEP study shows only four states collecting a higher average tax rate than Wisconsin in the $57,000-$88,000 range.

So Vos has evidence to back up this part of his claim.

But when you look at other levels within Vos’s middle-class range of $20,000 to $200,000, the burden is not quite as heavy as Vos said.

For example, at the $150,000 level in the Minnesota study, the rankings are No. 10 for singles, No. 8 for married couples filing jointly and No. 9 for single heads of household. Again, that’s among the 41 states with an income tax.

At $50,000, we found a mix of rankings between No. 3 and No. 7.

Finally, Vos mentioned one other income group, the ""successful,"" by which he meant upper-income. It’s not part of the claim we’re testing, but Vos said that group’s income-tax burden was in the middle of the 41 states.

That’s basically on target. We found tax-burden rankings from No. 11 to No. 17 for top earners in categories such as $250,000, $500,000 and $1 million annual income. These rankings were from the Minnesota study. The ITEP study also shows the rankings falling as income rises.

Our rating

Vos said that when it comes to income taxes, Wisconsin is ""one of the best places in the country to be poor"" but ""top 4 or 5 worst"" for middle-income earners.

He’s mostly on target here, based on credible tax studies showing a very low burden on the working poor, compared to a very high burden on many middle-income earners.

Not all the middle-income earners face a top-5 tax burden, though: It’s top-10 for some in the middle-class as he defined it.

We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/nov/14/robin-vos/vos-says-income-taxes-wisconsin-one-easiest-poor-a/
"['New Jersey', 'Medicaid', 'Steve Lonegan']","
Conservative activist Steve Lonegan says 60% of New Jersey doctors don’t accept Medicaid patients
","
Faced with low payment rates, most New Jersey doctors are apparently shutting their doors on Medicaid patients. 
And under a plan from President Barack Obama, the same fate will befall the Medicare program, according to conservative activist Steve Lonegan. 
In an Oct. 24 op-ed on the Asbury Park Press' website, Lonegan argued that changes to Medicare would lead that program down the path of Medicaid, which he claimed 60 percent of physicians in New Jersey do not accept.

""Medicaid vastly underpays doctors,"" wrote Lonegan, director of the New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group. ""Sixty percent of New Jersey doctors do not accept Medicaid patients. This is not a model to replicate for our seniors.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Lonegan’s 60 percent figure is on the mark. A recent study estimated that only about 40 percent of office-based physicians in the Garden State were accepting new Medicaid patients last year.

First, let’s explain how the Medicaid system works in New Jersey.

Most Medicaid services provided in New Jersey are done through a managed care system. Under that system, the state contracts with private insurers, who manage the patients’ health care and pay the doctors directly.

Some services in New Jersey are still covered on a fee-for-service basis, in which doctors are paid by the state.

To back up his claim, Lonegan directed us to a study by Sandra Decker, an economist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. That study was outlined in an article published in the August 2012 edition of a journal called Health Affairs.

The study was based on the responses of 4,326 physicians to a nationwide survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics from February 2011 to June 2011.

In that study, Decker estimated that about 40 percent of New Jersey doctors were accepting new Medicaid patients in 2011. To be more precise, the percent of such physicians in the Garden State is likely between 28 percent and 53 percent, according to the study.

That roughly 40 percent estimate represents the lowest percentage for any state and much less than the national average of 69.4 percent, the study shows.

Why don’t more physicians accept Medicaid patients? One reason appears to be about money: the less they’ll get paid, the less likely physicians will take on those patients.

The fee-for-service rates paid by states have been measured by how they compare with Medicare fees. Decker’s study shows that states with greater Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratios tended to have a higher percentage of physicians accepting new Medicaid patients.

New Jersey has ranked at the bottom for fee-for-service Medicaid payments in recent years, according to different studies.

It remains unclear how those fee-for-service rates compare to what some New Jersey doctors are getting paid to treat Medicaid patients on a managed care basis. Those managed care fees are negotiated between the physicians and the insurance companies.

State officials are not involved in those negotiations, and thus don’t know how much the doctors receive, according to Nicole Brossoie, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services.

But Stephen Zuckerman, a health policy expert at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, told us the two sets of rates are often similar, but doctors may get paid more in managed care systems.

However, under the health care reform enacted in 2010, certain doctors providing primary care services to Medicaid patients in both fee-for-service and managed care are supposed to receive 100 percent of Medicare rates for 2013 and 2014, according to federal regulations. 
Brian Cook, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in an e-mail that the fee increase applies to every state, and federal officials expect it to attract more physicians to accept Medicaid patients.

Our ruling

In an op-ed last month, Lonegan claimed: ""Sixty percent of New Jersey doctors do not accept Medicaid patients.""

That statement is backed up by a recent study estimating that roughly 40 percent of New Jersey doctors were accepting new Medicaid patients in 2011. The study also suggests that fewer physicians accept such patients in states with lower Medicaid payment rates.

We rate the statement True.

"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Chris Redfern']","
Chris Redfern says poll shows support for a nameless Democrat within 1 point of John Kasich
","
One election season ends, another begins.

Riding high the day after President Barack Obama’s re-election last week, Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern sharpened his rhetorical knives for 2014. Yes, 2014.

That’s when Republican Gov. John Kasich will be up for a second term. For months the state’s political observers have buzzed with speculation about which Democrats might challenge him.

With the presidential race in the books, expect to hear even more chatter in the coming weeks. Former Gov. Ted Strickland, whom Kasich ousted in 2010, soon will make his intentions known. Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald also hopes to announce a decision by year’s end.

Others in the mix include former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray, U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan of the Youngstown area and recently defeated U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton of Copley Township.

So it was little surprise to hear Redfern, in a post-election victory lap, slam Kasich’s leadership as ""corrosive."" He also said his party is in strong position for 2014, regardless of its nominee.

""Without a name attached, Democrats are just one point behind,"" Redfern said.

Redfern based the statement on numbers provided by Public Policy Polling, or PPP, a firm affiliated with Democrats. Eager for some insight on the nascent gubernatorial race, PolitiFact Ohio decided to explore the party chairman’s claim by looking at those numbers and others.

To better understand where Kasich stands today, consider where he was a year ago this month.

Voters had overwhelmingly rejected Senate Bill 5, a package of collective bargaining restrictions championed by Republican leaders in Columbus. A PPP poll had measured Kasich’s job approval rating at 33 percent. The polling firm also had found that, if given a mulligan on the 2010 election, Ohio voters would have backed Strickland over Kasich, 55 percent to 37 percent.

Bottom line: Kasich spent his first year in office as one of the nation’s most unpopular governors. But after the calendar flipped to 2012, Kasich’s popularity slowly began to climb. Pundits generally tie his rising political fortunes to voter confidence in Ohio’s rising economic fortunes.

In June, PPP pegged Kasich’s approval rating at 40 percent. The pollsters also asked voters about hypothetical matchupsbetween Kasich and several Democrats. The results showed the incumbent in statistical dead heats with Strickland and Cordray and with more comfortable leads over Ryan, Columbus Mayor Michael Coleman and U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich.

Considering Kasich’s results against Strickland and Cordray, PPP declared him ""already in trouble."" As for Coleman and Kucinich, there have been no rumblings about either, though Coleman briefly ran six years ago and the redistricted Kucinich will be out of Congress next year.

More recently, other organizations have shown Kasich’s approval rating near or above 50 percent. Late last month Kasich scored a 56 percent in The Plain Dealer/Ohio Newspaper Poll and a 49 percent in a survey by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute in Hamden, Conn.

PPP last checked in on Kasich for a pre-Election Day survey -- the poll that Redfern referenced. Of the 1,000 likely Ohio voters questioned, 45 percent approved of Kasich’s job performance. Forty percent disapproved while another 15 percent responded that they were not sure.

Unlike the June survey, in which voters were asked about potential Democratic rivals by name, this latest PPP poll generically framed the question regarding Kasich’s prospects.

Respondents were asked: ""Generally speaking, if there was an election for governor today, would you vote for Republican John Kasich or his Democratic opponent?"" Forty-four percent picked Kasich, 43 percent chose the Democrat. The remaining 13 percent were not sure.

The poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. Incidentally, the same poll had Obama leading in Ohio by 5 points; according to unofficial election results, he beat Mitt Romney by 2.

It is undeniable that Kasich’s popularity has risen since his rocky first year. It also is worth noting that while a PPP poll one year ago showed Strickland thrashing Kasich in a rematch, the governor has rebounded to the point where he’s essentially tied with a nameless challenger.

In other words, when it comes to this race, Democrats are not trending upward. Redfern never asserted otherwise. Rather, the state party chairman accurately explained where things stood: A polling firm, which he clearly cited, showed a generic Democrat trailing Kasich by 1 point.

A lot can change between now and November 2014. But polls, especially one this far out, should be looked at as a snapshot in time.

So on the Truth-O-Meter, Redfern’s statement rates True.",/factchecks/2012/nov/14/chris-redfern/chris-redfern-says-poll-shows-support-nameless-dem/
"['Georgia', 'Taxes', 'Clayton County Government']","
Officials correct outdated claim
","
PolitiFact Georgia was surfing some websites in the Atlanta area recently when it spotted an interesting claim listed under Clayton County ""facts"" on its government website.

""Clayton County offers the lowest operating millage rate in Metro Atlanta,"" it said.

Local governments are constantly boasting about various advantages to encourage people to move their business, or their families, into that city or county. The statement on Clayton’s website, which suggests homeowners could pay lower property taxes than any other part of metro Atlanta, intrigued us.

PolitiFact Georgia called Wade Starr, a former state representative from Clayton who now manages the county’s government operations. He said the statement was probably posted on the website a long time ago, based on some outdated information.

""It needs to be updated, probably,"" Starr said. ""Right now, I think there would be some other counties that would be lower than we are.""

We decided to take a look.

For those unfamiliar with the term millage rate, it is a formula governments use to determine how much property owners in a city or county should pay in taxes for police, firefighters and other government services. One ""mill"" equals $1 of property taxes for every $1,000 of assessed value. In Clayton County, the net 2012 tax year millage rate was 14.918.

PolitiFact Georgia reviewed the most recent government millage rates we found in some counties that either border Clayton or have a population of similar size.

In Cherokee County, which has a population slightly smaller than Clayton’s, the millage rate for operations, fire and a parks bond was lower, at 9.99 mills. Henry County, which abuts Clayton and  has about the same population, raised its millage rate this year to 14.5 mills. In Cobb County, the millage rate was 11.11. DeKalb County’s millage rate was higher than Clayton’s, at 21.21. These millage rates do not include school operations, which are typically higher than the government operations.

Starr said the recession, which officially began in 2008, hit the Clayton housing market worse than other counties. In 2008, Clayton had the region's largest price drop, with homes falling 43 percent in value, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Home Sales Report. The county's typical appraised value for 2010 was $90,589, according to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution analysis, a decline of 25 percent from the prior year. The typical sale price, meanwhile, was $80,656.

Starr talked about the decline in home values with us, saying he paid about $2,400 in property taxes in 2009. In 2011, Starr said he again paid about $2,400 in property taxes.

In 2008, Clayton’s net millage rate was 8.962 mills, according to county records. That’s about 6 mills less than it is now. Around that time, the millage rate was the second-lowest among the five highest-populated counties in the region, according to a comparison done by Fulton County. Cobb had the lowest rate, the comparison showed.

Starr said the information on that part of Clayton’s website was probably posted around that time. He said there was other information on that part of the website, such as the county’s population, that could be traced to that time.

Starr said Friday that the claim about the millage rate would be removed from the county’s website. We checked on Monday and it was gone.

In closing, the county’s website claimed it had the lowest operating millage rate in metro Atlanta. That information, the county now says, was based on outdated information and was going to be removed. Kudos to Clayton for correcting the information. The claim was False.",/factchecks/2012/nov/14/clayton-county-government/officials-correct-outdated-claim/
"['Georgia', 'Lottery', 'Brian Robinson']","
It's a good bet that your lottery director doesn't have lot of experience
","
Georgia’s $3.8 billion lottery is big business for the state, responsible for funding almost $1 billion for college scholarships and pre-kindergarten programs each year. With so much at stake, such a large enterprise is closely watched by the state’s top politicos.

The spotlight fell last month on the Georgia Lottery Board when one of its members resigned because she thought the panel was feeling pressured to hire Gov. Nathan Deal’s budget director as the next lottery chief.

The new chief, Debbie Dlugolenski Alford, a former director of the state’s Office of Planning and Budget and a member of the lottery board, had never worked for a lottery. Some officials, including a state Senate leader, questioned the selection and Alford’s qualifications.

Deal spokesman Brian Robinson dismissed the criticism, telling an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter that half the lottery directors across the country had not run a lottery before they were hired. Ultimately, the state lottery board unanimously confirmed Alford for the job Oct. 25.

We wondered whether Robinson’s claim was accurate. How many of the jurisdictions operating lotteries had directors without previous lottery experience? Was this an acceptable practice in the industry to roll the dice on an untested leader? And did a background in other professional fields qualify as related experience?

The Georgia Lottery Corp. has been in operation for 19 years and has sales exceeding $45 billion, according to information on the lottery’s website. Of that amount, more than $13.8 billion has been transferred to the state’s Lottery for Education Account. At any given time, Georgia’s lottery operates nine online or computerized games and about 40 instant ticket games.

We asked Robinson for any documentation to support his claim. The governor’s office provided a chart of lottery directors in 43 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The data, compiled by the governor’s office with a July 24 date, included a list of lottery CEOs and their former or concurrent occupation. The chart also included a background column on whether the CEO had lottery experience.

When asked, an office spokeswoman did not explain how the office qualified lottery experience, and whether it was based on any specific requirement such as length of time in office, training or related professional work.

Not content to take the governor’s office chart at face value, we did our own research on the 46 lottery chiefs listed on the chart. PolitiFact Georgia’s research found that 22 directors on the list appeared to have no previous lottery experience, including the directors for the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands lotteries. The limited background information found on those two directors did not appear to include any previous lottery experience.

For the most part, the governor’s office was accurate in its assessments, if previous lottery experience included sitting on a lottery board or commission, or serving in some other job for the same state lottery, such as legal counsel.


In a few cases, the chart information was incorrect based on our research of online biographies, related media articles or announcements and the lotteries’ websites. For example, the chart lists former Georgia Lottery chief Margaret deFrancisco as having no previous lottery experience. In fact, DeFrancisco had been director of the New York Lottery before coming to Atlanta. And the governor’s office listed Arizona’s lottery executive director, Jeff Hatch-Miller, as having previous experience, but his biography included no mention of previous lottery work. Hatch-Miller’s experience included time served on the state commission in charge of regulating utilities and time spent in the Arizona Legislature.

Overall, the operation of lotteries is done at the state level. There is no overarching organization or federal department with regulatory authority. Within the industry, the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, based in Geneva, Ohio, acts as the trade group for lotteries and provides support to lottery administrators. Membership consists of jurisdictions operating lotteries, including 43 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, five Canadian provinces and Mexico.

Qualifications for lottery directors or CEOs are determined by the states, said David Gale, the NASPL’s executive director. The NASPL does not keep statistics on lottery directors’ backgrounds.

""With past experience you’ll find a mix. There are some directors without previous lottery experience, but they have some business, budgeting and security experience that is significant in operating a lottery,"" Gale said. Also notable, he said, some of the top lottery positions are appointed positions that can be political appointments.

Direct experience in operating a lottery is not irrelevant, but it is only one of many qualities to consider in a CEO’s role, said Paul Jason, director of the Public Research Gaming Institute. A director with ties to the governor’s office or state legislature could be important in navigating between those offices and personalities and the lottery corporation, he said.

Georgia’s lottery has a ""deep bench"" of talented top management that can deal with the management of the lottery and can help the incoming director, making direct experience unnecessary [for the director], Jason said.

So let’s review. Robinson, the governor’s spokesman, shunned criticism about the state’s new lottery director having no previous lottery experience when selected for the job last month. Robinson told a newspaper reporter that half the country’s lottery directors had not run lotteries before taking the top job.

Robinson’s claim is correct -- in most cases. There is some room for interpretation.

Still, we rate Robinson’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/nov/13/brian-robinson/its-good-bet-your-lottery-director-doesnt-have-lot/
"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Robert Menendez']","
U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez says United States has created 5 million jobs during Barack Obama’s presidency
","
Before the two Democratic incumbents were re-elected Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez sought to put a number on President Barack Obama’s record on the economy: 5 million new jobs.

At an Oct. 27 campaign rally in Monmouth County, the senator claimed, ""this president has taken us from the abyss and from losing millions of jobs under Bush to having made 5 million jobs.""

Two days before voters headed to the polls, Menendez repeated the line at a Nov. 4 rally in Burlington County. Under Obama, the United States ""went from losing millions of jobs to creating 5 million jobs,"" Menendez told the crowd.

Five million new jobs? Well, it depends when you start counting and what types of jobs you’re talking about.

Our PolitiFact colleagues issued a Half True ruling in October on a similar claim by Obama, who said his administration has created 5 million jobs ""over the last 30 months in the private sector alone.""

Like Obama’s statement, Menendez’s claim is accurate only when you consider the net increase of nearly 5 million private-sector jobs since February 2010, the low point in the private-sector job market.

When you pull the yardstick back to different points during the first year of Obama's presidency, private-sector job growth has been less than what Menendez claimed. Also, in terms of total jobs, those private-sector gains have been offset by losses in the public-sector.

A spokeswoman for Menendez declined to comment.

Let’s break down the numbers.

As the end point for our analyses, we’re using the preliminary figures for October 2012, the latest jobs data available at the time of Menendez’s most recent statement.

Between February 2010 and October 2012, Obama presided over the net creation of just under 5 million private-sector jobs, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But the story changes slightly when you factor in the loss of public-sector jobs. Then, the net increase in total jobs has been about 4.5 million.

Still, starting at February 2010 represents cherry-picking a time frame that provides the best possible outlook on job growth. 
Let’s see what happens when we measure job growth from three separate starting points during Obama's first year in office: January 2009, when Obama was sworn in; February 2009, his first full month in office; and June 2009, the official beginning of the recovery, as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

In short, those starting points show there’s been less job growth than Menendez claimed.

Since January 2009, there’s been a net increase of 759,000 private-sector jobs. But given public-sector job losses, the net increase in total jobs has been 194,000.

Since February 2009, the nation has gained 1,484,000 private-sector jobs and lost 566,000 public-sector jobs, leaving it with a net increase of 918,000 total jobs.

Start at June 2009, and the net increase in private-sector jobs has been roughly 3.8 million. The net gain in total jobs lands at about 3.2 million, however, when factoring in the loss of 559,000 public-sector jobs.

One last note: experts have said that presidents have a limited impact on employment changes. So, it’s not appropriate to give Obama too much credit for job growth or too much blame for job losses.

Our ruling

At two campaign rallies leading up to the election, Menendez claimed that under Obama, the United States has created ""five million jobs.""

That’s only true if you’re talking about private-sector job growth since February 2010. When you factor in public-sector job losses and start counting at different points during Obama’s first year in office, the employment picture is far from what Menendez claimed.

We rate the statement Half True.

Ohio Democratic Party attacks Mike Dovilla over privatizing the Ohio Turnpike
","
Gov. John Kasich has talked of leasing the Ohio Turnpike to the highest bidder to bring in a new stream of cash to pay for some of the state’s infrastructure needs. 

But as the Republican governor has since found out, his idea has not fared well across Northern Ohio where the 241-mile toll road stretches from Youngstown, through Cleveland and beyond Toledo to the Indiana border. 

Even some of the governor’s fellow Republicans have stepped away from the idea, in part, because of a concern of their constituents. They assert that the turnpike is privately maintained with tolls from Northern Ohio residents who see no equity in privatizing the road to subsidize infrastructure problems in other parts of the state. 

Republican incumbent Ohio House Rep. Mike Dovilla lists himself among those conservatives not standing with the governor on this issue. But the Ohio Democratic Party isn’t buying it. 

The Democratic party and Dovilla’s opponent, former State Rep. Matt Patten, sent out campaign mailers that blasted Dovilla. The party said he supported unloading the turnpike to a private operator rather than keeping it in control of the Ohio Turnpike Commission, on whose board Dovilla serves as a non-voting member. 

""Now Dovilla has signed on to a dangerous plan that could allow a foreign corporation to take over the Ohio Turnpike,"" said a mailer paid for by the Ohio Democratic Party. A separate ad from Democrats states that because of Dovilla, ""you could pay a foreign corporation every time you drive the turnpike."" 

Dovilla called The Plain Dealer to cry foul, claiming he has been a frequent critic of the plan to lease the turnpike. The foreign corporation reference in the ads is in reference to the fact that Indiana within the past decade leased its toll road to a foreign company for a whopping payday. Ohio has cited Indiana as an example of what could occur here. 

While the mailers were sent to sway voters for Nov. 6’s election, Dovilla’s position on the Ohio Turnpike remains relevant. He holds a lead of just 305 votes in the unofficial tally from election night and the race likely will be decided by provisional ballots. 

And regardless of whether he holds onto that slim lead, the Kasich administration is expected to address the issue before the end of the year and the end of Dovilla’s current term.

So Politifact Ohio decided to check who’s right.

The Ohio Democratic Party notes that Dovilla on May 5, 2011 voted for the House version of House Bill 153, the state’s current two-year operating budget. The massive bill, whose comparison document alone was nearly 1,000 pages, contained a provision allowing Kasich to seek a deal to privatize a number of state-owned entities, including the Ohio Turnpike. 

""The fact is, Mike Dovilla voted for the House passed version of HB 153, which authorized the Kasich Administration to both study and sell the Ohio Turnpike,"" said Keary McCarthy, spokesman for the House Democrats. 

Dovilla argues that despite his vote, he never supported this specific provision. 

""I have been on the record in strong opposition to sale or lease of the Ohio Turnpike for more than a year,"" Dovilla told Politifact. ""In telephone conversations and emails exchanged with constituents, communications with the governor’s office, and a statement on our campaign’s website, my position on this matter is crystal clear."" 

Dovilla notes that the final bill budget bill approved by the legislature in June 2011 actually requires any turnpike lease deal Kasich might reach to be sent back to the full General Assembly for an approval. 

But McCarthy said that it was the Senate that put that language in the bill after the House had approved its version which Dovilla voted for. Once the bill was amended by the Senate and adjusted further by a conference committee, both the House and Senate then voted again on the bill — this time with the language requiring legislative approval of a turnpike lease deal. Dovilla again voted for the budget bill. 

He insists, ""my vote in favor of the state operating budget, HB 153, was not a vote for privatization."" McCarthy begs to differ and says Dovilla’s first vote signals his true intentions. So, who’s right? 

Politifact figured the best way to get at the root of this issue was to retrace what Dovilla claims has been his ""long-standing opposition"" to any form of privatization, even prior to last year’s budget vote. 

Dovilla sent Politifact several emails to constituents that purport to show him expressing his opposition: 
 
The Kasich administration is expected to reveal a report before the end of the year that lays out the state’s options for privatizing the turnpike. There is a small chance Kasich may opt to leave the turnpike as is but it is more likely the administration will propose some sort of deal to lease the toll road. 

So, where does that leave us in this spat between Dovilla and the Democratic party? 

The strength of the Democratic argument is that Dovilla’s initial vote was for a bill that — among hundreds, if not thousands, of other provisions — gave the governor sole authority to lease the turnpike without legislative input or authorization. The ad lists Dovilla’s House budget vote as a source for the claim. 

So there is an element of truth in the claim. 

Hard to ignore that Dovilla did vote for the House version of the bill which, if not later amended, would have allowed the governor alone to strike a turnpike privatization deal. That means that despite Dovilla’s stated opposition, he did vote to give Kasich the power to do exactly what the state representative says he vehemently opposes -- although the final version of the legislation did not confer that power to Kasich. 

But the strength of Dovilla’s argument is that while he supported the majority of the budget bill he did not agree with everything in it. And he provided documentation that indicates he has in fact opposed leasing the turnpike. 

Rarely these days is any Statehouse bill of a single intent or purpose. Such is the case especially with budget bills, which are typically thousands of pages, containing budget provisions for dozens of state agencies, departments, boards and commissions. 

It is unreasonable to conclude that a vote in favor of such a massive document indicates 100-percent support of everything within it. 

Those are critical facts that would give a listener a different impression of the claim.

On the Truth-O-Meter this statement rates Mostly False.

"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Jason Isaac']","
Jason Isaac says in past 20 years, Texas school spending rose 142% and per-pupil spending more than tripled when adjusted for inflation
","
Texas doesn’t have a school funding problem, state Rep. Jason Isaac said in a voters guide to the Nov. 6, 2012, election. ""We have a spending problem.""

The Dripping Springs Republican, who went on to win his second term, said: ""Over the past 20 years, expenditures for education have increased 142% and Texas’ per-pupil costs have increased from $3,659 to $11,024 after adjusting for inflation.""

He was responding to this question in the guide produced by the Austin and Texas chapters of the League of Women Voters: ""Since 2006, state educational funding has been reduced and student enrollment has increased. What measures would you propose to restore adequate funding to Texas schools?""

Since the 2011 Legislature modified school finance formulas -- sending schools $4 billion less than if the formulas had stayed the same -- PolitiFact Texas has fielded a range of related claims. Recently, lawmakers have said Texas did not cut education spending (Pants on Fire), raised education spending (Pants on Fire) and raised education’s share of the budget (Mostly True).

But none of those claims stretched back to the days of Guns ’N Roses.

We asked Isaac’s campaign for the backup on his statement. Spokeswoman Ellen Troxclair replied with a June 2010 report from the right-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation citing 1988-2008 total expenditures from the Texas Education Agency.

Some perspective: Texas enrollment has grown substantially in recent decades. Agency data showed an increase of 47 percent in Isaac’s chosen time span, from 3.2 million pupils to 4.7 million.

Looking at the foundation report’s data on expenditures, we first realized that Isaac’s per-pupil statement had not been adjusted for inflation, in contrast to what he said in the guide. He gave a starting point of $3,659, which is the unadjusted amount for 1987-88. In 2008 dollars, it comes out to $6,659, confirmed by the foundation report and our math using the federal Consumer Price Index online calculator.

Working from 2008 dollars at both ends of the 20-year period yields a 66 percent increase, rather than the 201 percent increase Isaac’s numbers indicated. That is, per-pupil spending increased at about one third the rate he suggested.
 
The first part of Isaac’s claim came straight from the report, Troxclair said. And it checks out, according to our math and the education agency’s data. From 1987-88 through 2007-08, using 2008 dollars to adjust for inflation, Texas’ total expenditures on education rose 142 percent.

Experts suggested other flaws in Isaac’s statement.

First, operating expenditures would be a better measure than total expenditures, we heard in interviews with Texas Association of School Boards spokesman Dominic Giarratani and school funding expert Lori Taylor, an associate professor at Texas A&M University’s Bush School of Government and Public Service.

That’s because total expenditures fluctuate due to big-ticket construction projects that school districts mostly pay for on their own by issuing bonds. Operating expenditures more accurately reflect state budget dollars, they said.

We found that over the 20 years singled out by Isaac, inflation-adjusted operating expenditures more than doubled, rising 112 percent, or 42 percent per pupil.

Troxclair acknowledged what she called the ""wording error"" on the per-pupil inflation adjustment, but disagreed with the idea that Isaac should have relied solely on operating expenditures. ""Money spent on construction projects is still money being spent,"" she said.

Second, Taylor noted that although Isaac said ""the past 20 years,"" his data set ends in 2008, overlooking the three most recent school years including the two affected by the cuts lawmakers approved in 2011.

That’s understandable in the case of the foundation’s report, which was written in 2010. However, Isaac made his statement more than a year after lawmakers completed the 2012-13 budget. Even so, Isaac would not have been able to compare actual spending numbers for 2011-12, because they won’t be published until spring 2013. The 2010-11 data was out, but also would not have included the 2011 legislative cuts.

Troxclair told us Isaac relied on the 2010 report because it was the most comprehensive analysis available from the foundation.

The state’s budgeted amounts, rather than dollars actually spent, came out March 8, 2012, so we ran those over a 20-year period to see how the cuts might change the picture. Budgeted amounts for 1992-2012 showed mostly smaller increases than actual spending in 1988-2008, particularly in operating costs: Total budgeted spending was up 72 percent compared to 1992, or 20 percent per pupil. Operating budgeted spending was up 69 percent, or 17 percent per pupil.

Pencils down!

Our ruling

Isaac said, ""Over the past 20 years, expenditures for education have increased 142% and Texas’ per-pupil costs have increased from $3,659 to $11,024 after adjusting for inflation.""

He’s correct that, adjusted for inflation, total spending went up 142 percent from 1988 through 2008. But that leaves out recent years, including those affected by 2011’s legislative changes. And focusing on the increase alone without taking into account growth factors, especially enrollment, can be misleading.

A different measure, budgeted total spending, rose 72 percent from 1992 through 2012.

Isaac indicated that per-pupil spending had tripled after adjusting for inflation. The correct amounts show it didn’t even double.

So while Isaac’s comment has an element of truth -- spending did increase -- his first declared fact lacks vital context and the second is a substantial overstatement. We rate the overall statement as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/nov/12/jason-isaac/jason-isaac-says-past-20-years-texas-school-spendi/
"['Georgia', 'Federal Budget', 'Saxby Chambliss']","
Senator says urges plan to avoid fiscal cliff
","
Now that we know President Barack Obama will serve a second term in the White House, elected officials and others have focused their attention on an issue that could hurt the wallets of most Americans.

Unless Obama and congressional leaders strike a deal on the budget by the end of the year, a series of automatic tax hikes and budget cuts would occur. ""Sequestration"" is the official term, but it’s commonly known as the ""fiscal cliff.""

U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., has been talking about the issue for months to anyone willing to listen. For about two years, he’s been part of a small bipartisan team of senators working on a long-term solution to put the federal budget on solid financial footing. A recent interview in The Washington Post raised our eyebrows for several reasons. One thing he said prompted us to pull out the Truth-O-Meter.

""There is no silver bullet to this problem. You’ve got to have reductions in spending, you’ve got to have entitlement reform, you’ve got to have tax reform. Revenues are 15 percent of GDP — it’s still in the range of the lowest it’s ever been,"" Chambliss said. GDP stands for gross domestic product.

We wondered whether the senator was correct about federal revenue and whether it is close to the lowest it has ever been.

The federal government collects about 80 percent of its revenue from income taxes. Corporate income taxes account for about 10 percent. The rest comes from estate and gift taxes and other sources. The federal government currently collects about $2 trillion a year and spends about $3 trillion. As you can see, there’s a problem.

If Congress cannot find a solution that prevents the ""fiscal cliff,"" a payroll tax cut pushed through by the Obama administration would end, meaning most Americans would see their paychecks decline by 2 percent. The Alternative Minimum Tax would be applied to an estimated 26 million U.S. households, raising taxes by an average of $3,700. There would be a 9 percent cut in Defense Department spending and a 2 percent cut to Medicare providers.

Although some experts believe Washington lawmakers will find a last-minute solution to avoid stepping off the cliff, Chambliss is worried. He warned that if Congress and the White House don’t reach a solution to start reducing the nation’s budget deficit, the U.S. could become like Greece, which is desperately trying to avoid bankruptcy, and ""[y]ou could see riots in the streets.""

Chambliss spokeswoman Lauren Claffey pointed to federal budget data to back up the senator’s claim.

The White House Office of Management and Budget keeps annual figures dating to 1930 on revenue as a percentage of GDP. The federal government currently manages its finances on a 12-month fiscal year schedule that begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30.

The most recent completed data was for fiscal year 2011, which began Oct. 1, 2010, and ended Sept. 30, 2011. During that period, federal revenue was 15.4 percent of GDP. For the fiscal year that just ended, it’s estimated to be 15.8 percent.

For fiscal year 2013, the White House estimates it will rise to 17.8 percent. The expected increase is a result of the end of tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003, projections for a stronger economy, tax increases resulting from the 2010 health care law and other factors, said Curtis Dubay, a senior tax policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank based in Washington.

Since fiscal year 2009, which began in the final months of George W. Bush’s presidency, revenue has been in the 15 percent range. The last time it was that low was 1949 and 1950. Before 1943, federal revenue was no higher than 13 percent.

""[R]evenue is within the lowest range it has been for the past 70 years,"" Claffey said via email.

Dubay said federal revenue, and spending, grew exponentially during World War II and as pre-war New Deal programs became implemented. Thus, he said, you can’t make the comparison of revenue collected before the war.

""The role of the federal government changed so much,"" he said. ""You can’t compare the federal government prior to World War II. It did different things.""

Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, agreed that ""World War II was a watershed moment"" for the federal budget, particularly in defense spending. He noted that the federal government didn’t collect taxes on Social Security benefits until that time, which was 1937. Williams also pointed out some of the other major changes in government spending and revenue requirements, such as Great Society initiatives like Medicare, enacted in the 1960s.

To summarize, Chambliss said federal revenue is in the range of the lowest it’s ever been. Since that type of data has been recorded by the federal government, the only time it’s been lower for a period longer than now was before World War II. We still believe that bit of context is necessary to fully examine the senator’s claim. Our rating: Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/nov/12/saxby-chambliss/senator-says-urges-plan-avoid-fiscal-cliff/
"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Rebecca Kleefisch']","
Rebecca Kleefisch says Wisconsin ranks first among states in manufacturing jobs per capita
 ","
Wisconsin’s is unmatched nationally on a key jobs measure, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch asserted while promoting a fall summit of small-business owners and officials of Gov. Scott Walker’s administration.

""You probably already know we lead the nation in making cheese, and you definitely know the Packers will always be at the top,"" Kleefisch said while delivering the governor’s statewide radio address Nov. 1, 2012. ""But did you know that Wisconsin still ranks first among the 50 states in manufacturing jobs per capita? That’s right!""

Kleefisch’s radio statement also ran as an opinion piece that was published by various new outlets.

It’s well documented that Walker promised in the 2010 governor’s race that Wisconsin would add 250,000 private-sector jobs by the end of his first term, in January 2015. Through nearly two years of his four-year term, job gains total 31,911.

It’s also pretty well known that Wisconsin has lost a big chunk of its manufacturing sector going back a decade or more.

So is it possible the state is still the king of making things?

There’s more than one way to skin this statistical cat, but Wisconsin scores high on several manufacturing-job measures.

Manufacturing dependency: The factory sector here employs a bigger share of the state's workers than any other state except Indiana, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on Oct. 7, 2012.

Idaho-based Economic Modeling Specialists Intl. reported in March 2012 that ""Indiana is 86% more concentrated in manufacturing than average and just nudges Wisconsin for the top spot in our analysis."" Indiana is home to Subaru and Honda auto plants, which give the state a boost.

Manufacturing vs. government jobs: Calculations by the Wisconsin Budget Project have shown that Wisconsin and Indiana are neck-and-neck for the highest ratio of manufacturing jobs to government jobs in the nation -- a ratio viewed by some as a good measure of a state’s economic health.

But Kleefisch referred to a third measure: Manufacturing jobs per capita.

We located U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports and crunched the numbers behind her claim. We separately enlisted Jon Peacock, research director of the Wisconsin Budget Project, an arm of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families.

Wisconsin -- as Kleefisch claimed -- tops Indiana and every other state when you compare factory jobs to the overall state population.

Peacock took a slightly different tack, comparing those jobs to the overall pool of potential workers -- the non-institutional population age 16 and older.

""Wisconsin is #1, and by a much larger margin than I anticipated,"" Peacock said. ""What I found is that 10 percent of Wisconsin’s population age 16 and older works in manufacturing. Indiana is #2 at 9.6 percent, followed by Iowa at 9.1 percent, and Kansas at 7.5 percent.  The national average is 4.9 percent.""

That’s good news and bad news, Peacock said.

It’s a point of pride -- and manufacturing jobs are extremely important for Wisconsin. But the state economy might be stronger if it diversified and became less dependent upon a sector that will probably continue to decline as a percentage of the national workforce, Peacock said.

Kleefisch, though, is on target with the numbers.

Part of the explanation is that Wisconsin dropped a smaller share of its manufacturing jobs than many other big factory-reliant states in the 2000s. Those job losses in the sector began to reverse in about January 2010, both nationally and in Wisconsin. Walker took office in January 2011.

Still, though, Wisconsin is 150,000 manufacturing jobs short of its January 2000 total, according to September 2012 federal figures.

Our rating

Kleefisch claimed that Wisconsin ""still ranks first among the 50 states in manufacturing jobs per capita.""

Economists debate the wisdom of heavy reliance on that sector, but Kleefisch accurately describes the state’s ranking.

"['New Jersey', 'Candidate Biography', 'Elections', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims again that he was first governor to endorse Mitt Romney for president
","
When it comes to presidential campaigns, it seems almost no one was as supportive of Mitt Romney for president than Gov. Chris Christie.

The Republican governor spent the past year crisscrossing the country to stump for Romney, a Republican. President Barack Obama defeated Romney in Tuesday’s election, and many have mentioned Christie as a possible presidential contender for 2016.

One might think Christie was the first politician to stand up for Romney, given a claim that Christie repeated Wednesday during a press conference in Harvey Cedars. While there to discuss preparations for a nor’easter about to hit the state, Christie answered a question about praising Obama’s response in helping New Jersey in the wake Hurricane Sandy. Christie also dismissed questions about his loyalty to Romney after the widely publicized image of his extended handshake with Obama during the president’s Oct. 31 visit to tour hurricane damage along the Jersey Shore.

""I’m a guy who tells the truth, all the time. And if the president of the United States did something good, I was going to say he did something good and give him credit for it,"" Christie said, according to a Nov. 7 story on the New York Post’s website.

""But it doesn’t take away for a minute the fact that I was the first governor in America to endorse Mitt Romney, that I traveled literally tens of thousands of miles for him, raised tens of millions of dollars for him and worked harder, I think, than any other surrogate in America other than Paul Ryan,"" he continued.

Christie’s ""a guy who tells the truth, all the time""? Not quite.

For this fact check we’re focusing on the claim that Christie was the first governor in the country to endorse Romney because he’s made the claim several times and received a False on the Truth-O-Meter for it. And this isn’t the first time, either, that Christie has repeated claims proven false.

Let’s go back to Aug. 28, when Christie said on ""CBS this Morning"" about Romney that ""I’ve spent since October of last year -- first governor in America to endorse him -- (running) around the country to 15 different states campaigning for him and raising money.""

We determined in a September fact-check that Christie was one of the first Republican governors to endorse Romney, but he wasn’t the first.

After announcing he wouldn’t make a presidential run himself, Christie traveled to New Hampshire and endorsed Romney on Oct. 11, 2011. But a couple of other governors threw their support behind Romney first.

The Romney campaign announced Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman’s endorsement in a June 10, 2011 news release posted on its website.

On July 2, an article on the Washington Post’s website said, ""Romney has been endorsed by two governors, Dave Heineman of Nebraska and Butch Otter of Idaho, as well as one former governor, Colorado’s Bill Owens.""

A Politico article on July 16, 2011 pointed out how only a few governors -- including Heineman and Otter -- had given endorsements in the GOP presidential primary race.

A Dec. 1 article in the New York Times stated that Heineman was identified as ""the first governor to endorse Mr. Romney.""

So while Christie’s support for Romney is clear, it’s also clear that he was not the first governor to endorse him for president.

Christie spokesmen Michael Drewniak and Kevin Roberts did not respond to a request for comment.

Our ruling

Christie was one of the most ardent supporters of Romney for president and stated several times in recent months that ""I was the first governor in America to endorse Mitt Romney.""

The Truth-O-Meter gave the governor a False on this claim in September, noting that Heineman was the first, followed by Otter, to endorse Romney.

Consistently supporting a candidate for president is one thing. But consistently repeating a false claim about being the first governor in the country to endorse that candidate is ridiculous. Pants on Fire, governor!

"['Tennessee', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'Bill Haslam']","
Tennessee’s outcomes-based college funding model already “changing the way our postsecondary institutions do business,” says Haslam
","
When we saw the Oct. 18 edition of Time magazine – its higher education issue – we found Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam listed as one of eight people the magazine consulted for ""8 Ideas to Improve Higher Education."" Haslam’s article: ""Tie Funding to Graduation Rates.""

The governor described the big changes in the focus and funding of Tennessee’s public higher education system brought about by the Complete College Tennessee Act, which was approved by the Tennessee legislature in 2010 at the behest of then-governor Phil Bredesen.

CCTA did several things, all with a goal of improving the rate at which Tennesseans attain college degrees or post-high school certificates to help prepare them for the modern workforce. Toward that end, the law revised how the state allocates taxpayer funding among its public universities, community colleges and technical institutes, away from the old model based mostly on enrollment and to an ""outcomes-based"" formula to reward institutions that perform well in helping students advance through their programs and graduate.

Haslam wrote: ""States have traditionally funded their public institutions of higher education based on enrollments. This means the more students attending an institution, the more money that institution receives from the state. While this may incentivize colleges to expand access, it does nothing to incentivize efficiency and productivity. Institutions are rewarded for admitting more students and keeping them enrolled as long as possible, not for ensuring that every student is making progress toward a degree and ultimately leaving with a credential that has value in the labor market.

""Instead of funding … based on enrollments, states should use a formula that pays institutions for success in key areas like progress toward and completion of degrees and credentials. … Tennessee remains the only state to have a 100 percent outcomes-based model … (and) we are already seeing this model changing the way our postsecondary institutions do business.""

We decided to look at Haslam’s claims.

It’s a given that the 2010 legislation changed the funding formula to a performance and outcomes based model. A Tennessee Higher Education Commission summary says, ""The outcomes-based funding formula bases the entire institutional allocation of state appropriations on the basis of outcomes including degree production, research funding and graduation rates at universities, and student remediation, job placements, student transfer and associates degrees at community colleges.""

Higher education officials agree that 100 percent of the variable funding component of the formula is based on outcomes. That variable funding is about 80 to 85 percent of the total state appropriation for public higher education. There is also funding allocated for fixed costs like routine building operating expenses and utility costs that are based on square footage and type of space. But the bulk of the funding is allocated totally on performance. Dr. Richard Rhoda, executive director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission says it’s also true that ""Tennessee is the only state in which the funding formula for higher education is totally outcomes-based.""

Perhaps the most important part of the discussion for students is whether and how the institutions they attend are, in the governor’s words, changing how they do business.

On that point, officials agree: a lot, particularly by committing more resources to help students succeed. Most universities, including the University of Tennessee and the University of Memphis, have established student success programs and centers and academic support centers where students can get individual and group tutoring, advising centers where advisers review students’ majors and recommend what courses they need to take, and career centers that help students figure out what they want to do and what majors they need to get there. Those centers and advisers constantly remind students and their parents during orientation and enrollment that the advising services are available. UT has consolidated its student success center in new offices in Greve Hall, and has established a ""one-stop shop"" for success counseling and tutoring in the newly renovated Commons at the main library. It has also created UT LEAD, a program to promote undergraduate success, academic excellence and persistence to graduation for selected students awarded the Tennessee Pledge or Tennessee Promise scholarships.

""This has indeed changed the way we do business. It is fair to say that each of our institutions is looking at how they allocate financial resources and assessing how those allocations will contribute to outcomes,"" said Chancellor John Morgan of the Tennessee Board of Regents, which governs U of M, Southwest Tennessee and Pellissippi State community colleges, and all other institutions outside the University of Tennessee System. ""Since the outcomes under the formula are heavily weighted toward student progression and program completion, there is an intense focus on spending money in a way that will promote student success.""

Rhoda at THEC agreed: ""The changes we are seeing are in the forms of more intentional and direct assistance to students in selecting courses and majors; getting students to focus on completing programs and earning credentials; new programs that lead to credentials and skills that employers are seeking; and targeting adults with some college experience but no degree.""

On that last group, adults with no degree, Rhoda says THEC is advocating Prior Learning Assessment on all state campuses – which helps adults earn college credit for skills they have acquired in the workplace. Rhoda said the University of Memphis appears further along in that than other institutions, offering experiential learning credit.

Our ruling

So, funding is outcomes based and the institutions are changing the way they operate, by focusing more resources on students. We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2012/nov/11/bill-haslam/tennessees-outcomes-based-college-funding-model-al/

Progressive Democratic group's attack on Joe Biden's voting record needs some context
","As soon as former Vice President Joe Biden announced his run for the presidency, he drew fire from the more progressive side of the Democratic Party. Justice Democrats, a group that backs Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and other new faces in Congress, issued a tweet thread laying out why Biden is not their candidate. ""Joe Biden stands in near complete opposition to where the center of energy is in the Democratic Party today,"" the group wrote April 25. ""We don’t need someone who voted for the Iraq War, for mass incarceration, and for the Bankruptcy Reform Act, while voting against gay marriage, reproductive rights, and school desegregation."" The six issues in that tweet have long been seen as Biden’s Achilles’ heel in this Democratic primary. Biden’s votes are a matter of record, but on some points, such as gay marriage, Biden switched his position. This is accurate. A little after midnight on Oct. 11, 2002, Biden joined 28 Democrats and 48 Republicans in the U.S. Senate to authorize the use of military force against Iraq. While the resolution encouraged working through the U.N. Security Council to disarm Iraq, it gave President George W. Bush a free hand to use American armed forces ""as he determines to be necessary and appropriate."" The night of the vote, Biden said his concerns were eased by Bush who had said ""war is neither imminent nor inevitable."" Formally, the authorization was not a vote for war, but there was little doubt at the time that war would come. He voted for bills that had that effect. Biden voted for two large bills in 1988 and 1994 that experts agree added millions of people to America’s prisons. But both were sprawling pieces of legislation that included programs to reduce incarceration, too. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 funded alcohol and drug treatment programs and efforts to reach high-risk youth. On the other hand, it doubled down on imposing stiffer penalties for possession of crack cocaine, more common in African American communities, than for possession of powdered cocaine, more common among whites. And it extended mandatory minimum sentences to people under 21 who sold less than 5 grams of marijuana. Biden was one of 87 senators to approve the bill. He also voted for the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, along with 53 other Democrats. Among other features, the bill included the Violence Against Women Act and banned 19 types of semi-automatic assault weapons. It funded 100,000 new police officers to expand community policing. But it also imposed life sentences on many more people through a federal ""three strikes and you’re out"" provision, and it provided over $12 billion to help states build prisons. To get the money, states had to pass laws to keep people behind bars for at least 85% of their sentences. With more people serving longer sentences, the prison population skyrocketed, doubling between 2004 and 2009. He did. In the early 2000s, Biden co-sponsored legislation that would make it harder for people to qualify for bankruptcy protection. The financial industry, a major donor to Biden’s campaigns, was eager to tighten the rules on Chapter 7, the most common path for households to wipe out their debts. In 2005, Biden backed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, and on a vote of 74 to 25, it passed the Senate and became law. Under it, if a person made more than the median income in their state, and could afford to pay $100 a month on their debts, then they could not file for Chapter 7 protection. He did, but he later changed his position. Justice Democrats told us this charge against Biden tracks back to his 1996 vote on the Defense of Marriage Act. The measure defined marriage as between a man and a woman and allowed states not to recognize same-sex marriages. Same-sex couples could not claim federal benefits. Biden was one of 85 senators to vote in favor. By 2012, then-Vice President Biden had changed his views. In an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Biden said, ""I am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women and heterosexual men and women marrying one other are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties."" At the time, that went beyond where the Obama administration stood, which triggered some quick press work by the White House communications team. Most of his votes favored abortion rights, with limits. As a Catholic, Biden has always navigated between the doctrines of his church and the policies of his party on abortion. The tension came to a head in March 1982 when Biden voted in committee to approve a constitutional amendment that allowed states to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court case that affirmed abortion rights. The amendment never came to a full Senate vote. And the next year, on a second try, Biden voted against it. Biden settled on a position in which he separated his personal beliefs from government policy. In the 2012 vice presidential debate, he said he believes that life begins at conception, as the Catholic church says. But he rejected the idea that government could impose that belief on everyone. ""I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people that women can't control their body,"" Biden said. ""It's a decision between them and their doctor."" Biden added that the government should not help pay for women to have an abortion. He voted against busing, but he supported desegregation. Biden won his Senate seat in 1972 on a platform of integration, but once in office, he came under strong pressure from white constituents who hated the idea of busing to desegregate schools. Historian Jason Sokol at the University of New Hampshire tracked Biden’s response to local opposition. In the Senate, Biden began voting for anti-busing amendments. In 1974, he said ""I have become convinced that busing is a bankrupt concept."" ""Biden always claimed that he favored school desegregation but opposed busing as the means to achieve it,"" Sokol told us. ""The amendments that he proposed, or supported, in the mid and late 1970s, paint a somewhat muddled picture. He did indeed propose some amendments that would have effectively hamstrung all efforts for desegregation. When he was made aware of those practical effects, he sometimes backed off — and he sometimes pressed on nonetheless."" We reached out to Biden’s campaign and did not hear back. Biden’s spokesman Bill Russo told CNN recently that Biden continues to believe that busing could not deliver a true solution to unequal education opportunity. ""Joe Biden is today — and has been for more than 40 years in public life — one of the strongest and most powerful voices for civil rights in America,"" Russo told CNN. Justice Democrats accused Biden on six points: Voting for the Iraq War, for mass incarceration, and the Bankruptcy Reform Act, ""while voting against gay marriage, reproductive rights, and school desegregation."" On each, there is a measure of accuracy. Biden’s support for the bankruptcy law has the clearest proof, and the Iraq resolution is a close second. For the others, there are varying degrees of nuance. The crime bills greatly expanded the prison population, but they included other measures that aimed to protect women and offered alternatives to incarceration. Biden’s views on gay marriage changed. He once supported giving states the option to overturn Roe vs. Wade, but then opposed such a move, and his views on abortion affirm a basic right, while allowing for limits. He opposed busing, but favored integration by other means. The Biden record is more mixed than this claim would suggest.

No, George Soros never said he made it his life’s mission to ‘destroy the United States’

The full quote reads: ""'I’ve made my life’s mission to destroy the United States. I hate this country and I hate all of the people in it!' George Soros, Newsweek 1979"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

We found a lot of full-page cigarette ads, a feature about roller skating and a cover story documenting images of ""man’s closest look at Saturn."" What we did not find was any evidence that Soros ever said such a thing. Further, we searched news clips more broadly and found no legitimate record that he said this in any other publication or interview either. In the 40 years since the quote was supposedly published in the news magazine, not one credible source has ever mentioned it – something that would have certainly happened given Soros’ prominence and the inflammatory nature of the comment. ""George Soros has never made any such statement,"" Laura Silber, chief communications officer for the Soros-funded Open Society Foundations, told PolitiFact. ""Mr. Soros cares deeply about the United States and is dedicated to strengthening this country’s promise for all its people."" We found that part of the quote was used, in bold-face type, and attributed to Soros in a 2011 Breitbart article that discusses the ""looming breakdown in society,"" placing the blame on the ""veterans"" and ""descendants of the Radical Left from the 1960s: ""There are those who wish to do nothing more than to fan these flames. ‘Destroying America will be the culmination of my life’s work.’~ George Soros.’"" But the article provides no details on where or when Soros allegedly said this and simply continues on. We also found a variation of a portion of the quote in a 2011 reddit thread in which users were trying to find the context of Soros allegedly saying: ""Destroying America will be the culmination of my life’s work."" The thread referenced a right-wing blog that posted the quote in 2010 with the source as The Australian newspaper. Though the blog doesn’t give specifics on when Soros supposedly said this, in a 2009 interview between Soros and the newspaper, Soros talked about the culmination of his life’s work, but it is nothing close to the quote. Here is the exact excerpt from The Australian: ""Peter Wilson: So people bring things to your attention if they think a situation is developing in a region or a market? ""George Soros: I read the newspaper, I have some financial services that I also look at. I’m not on top of the financial markets. I just don’t have adequate information on detail so I can only use blunt instruments that are sort of macroeconomic instruments. On the other hand, I am tremendously involved in policy issues and that is where I am focusing. ""Wilson: What sort of policy? ""Soros: The financial crisis, and how to solve it. It was not something that I was particularly concerned with prior to the rise of the crisis and I am also involved in the activities of the (Soros) Foundation. ""Wilson: But for the past 18 months you have been keeping an eye on the markets? ""Soros: Yeah but I have also been writing a lot more than I was writing before because the crisis really stimulated me.

""Wilson: So do you have a sense that things are coming together for you now? ""Soros: It is in a way a culminating point of my life’s work, so to speak."" At no point in the exchange does Soros say his life’s mission is to destroy the United States, or that ""destroying America"" would be the culmination of his life’s work. Here, he is referring to solving the financial crisis, the books he is writing, and his work with the Soros Foundation as a culmination of his life’s work. A quote attributed to Soros is spreading on social media, claiming he told Newsweek in 1979 that he’s made it his ""life’s mission to destroy the United States,"" and that he hates the country and all the people in it.

Wisconsin state senator hits pothole with claim on costs of bad roads
","Now that the snow has cleared, it’s time to switch our thoughts from winter to the next season: Orange barrel season. In his 2019-’21 budget, Gov. Tony Evers’ transportation plan calls for bringing in an additional $520 million over two years from an increased gas tax and higher transportation fees. In supporting Evers’ spending plan, some Democrats have noted the rough conditions of local roads. ""Our road conditions cost WI families,"" state Sen. LaTonya Johnson, D-Milwaukee, said April 3, 2019 on Twitter. ""In Milwaukee, the average cost per driver is $2,300. Our families simply cannot afford for us to continue to kick the can down the road. We need a sustainable transportation funding solution."" Is Johnson right about how much bad roads are costing drivers in Milwaukee? Not exactly. Several studies we reviewed all rated the road conditions in the city -- and the state -- poorly. But Johnson far overstates the amount of the cost that is due to those bad conditions. The background In February 2019, we rated Mostly True a claim from Evers’ pick as transportation secretary that among neighboring states, the condition of Wisconsin highways was rated ""not only the worst, but it was worse by a gaping margin."" Evers’ budget would bump the state’s gas tax from 32.9 cents per gallon to 40.9 cents. Starting in April 2020, the gas tax would automatically go up by an inflationary amount every year — reinstating a policy known as indexing that lawmakers eliminated in 2005. The money is not all aimed at state highways. Part of Evers’ transportation plan calls for giving local governments a 10 percent increase in aid to help them fill potholes and fix roads in their communities.That represents an increase of $66 million. ""We’ll see a significant increase for counties and municipalities and to fix roads and bridges that frankly aren’t part of the interstate system,"" Evers said in a Feb. 21, 2019 Wisconsin State Journal article. The evidence When asked for backup, Johnson chief of staff Lacy Fox directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a September  2018 report compiled by the national transportation research group TRIP. The group is a nonprofit, but notes on its website it is sponsored by ""insurance companies, equipment manufacturers, distributors and suppliers; businesses involved in highway and transit engineering and construction; labor unions; and organizations concerned with efficient and safe surface transportation."" So, it’s interest is increased road spending. That said, the group’s reports are cited by many media outlets, including the Washington Post and NBC News. TRIP calculated the cost to the average motorist per year in the state’s largest urban areas in the form of additional vehicle operating costs as a result of driving on rough roads, the cost of lost time and wasted fuel due to congestion, and the financial cost of traffic crashes. Here is that breakdown: Eau Claire: $1,219 Green Bay-Appleton-Oshkosh: $1,456 Madison: $2,139 Milwaukee: $2,321 Wausau: $1,517 Those totals, though, include much more than costs tied directly to road conditions -- which was the focus of Johnson’s tweet. If you focus more strictly on the condition of local roads -- which is what the Evers’ proposal is aimed at improving -- you get a much smaller amount: Eau Claire: $665 Green Bay-Appleton-Oshkosh: $816 Madison: $910 Milwaukee: $944 Wausau: $885 Additional reports What’s more, other entities that have examined the cost to drivers of road conditions found a similar amount. Teletrac Navman, a software company that specializes in fleet and asset management, ranked Milwaukee the fifth worst major urban area in the nation when it comes to road conditions. The Illinois-based firm put Milwaukee’s annual vehicle maintenance costs at $861. That ranked the city seventh among major urban areas. Here is the top 10: Oklahoma City, Okla: $1,025 Tulsa, Okla.: $998 San Francisco-Oakland: $978 Los Angeles-Long Beach: $892 Detroit: $865 San Jose, Calif:  $863 Milwaukee: $861 Omaha, Neb.: $852 Bridgeport-Stamford, Conn.: $797 San Antonio: $791 Other studies involving Wisconsin and the nation found comparable costs. A 2019 report from the American Society of Civil Engineers shows poor condition public roads in Wisconsin are costing state drivers $736 each year. Based on data from a 2017 Infrastructure Report Card, conducted for all 50 states, the report noted that some of the high cost of driving on broken roads comes from wear and tear on car parts. A 2016 AAA (American Automobile Association) report narrows the cost of poor roads down even further, focusing only on pothole damage, noting that potholes on local roads costs American drivers $3 billion a year. It gives the annual average pothole-related cost to drivers as $300 in repairs. Those are further evidence that the claim made by Johnson is off the mark. Milwaukee spending In addition to the state spending, of course, the city picks up a large chunk of the cost of street repairs. Indeed, most of the city’s streets are not eligible for outside funding. Here is a look at the breakdown and where the money is going in the 2019 budget: Major streets: These 286 miles of major and minor arterials are eligible for county, state, and federal funding. The 2019 budget includes $32.5 million for the major street program, of which $5.5 million is city funding. Local streets: Approximately 987 miles of city streets are typically not eligible for state and federal funding. In 2019, $6.2 million was included in the proposed budget for the resurfacing and reconstruction of local streets. In addition, $2.5 million was set aside for pothole patching and street maintenance. Another $5.6 million is earmarked for the ""high-impact"" program, which focused on quick curb-to-curb resurfacing of major streets, typically in commercial areas. Our rating In backing Evers’ transportation plan, Johnson claimed road conditions in Milwaukee cost the average driver $2,300. TRIP, a frequently cited national nonprofit that researches and evaluates data on transportation issues, has generated a $2,321 per year figure for Milwaukee drivers. But that figure applies to a broader set of issues than strictly road conditions, which is what Johnson focused on. When the focus is on road conditions, TRIP’s figure for Milwaukee is $944 per year -- one that is more in line with other studies on the cost of bad roads to drivers. Our definition for Mostly False is ""The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.",/factchecks/2019/apr/26/latonya-johnson/wisconsin-state-senator-hits-pothole-claim-costs-b/

Klobuchar wants to stop pay-for-delay deals that keep drug prices high
","Washington’s recent fixation with lowering drug costs has introduced Americans to once-insider terms like pharmacy benefit managers and list prices. During an April 22 CNN town hall event for Democratic candidates, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., described a drugmaker practice that sounds a lot like bribery — drawing attention to yet another secretive process that lawmakers and experts say prevents patients from obtaining affordable prescription drugs. America, meet ""pay-for-delay."" ""We can stop this horrible practice where big pharmaceuticals pay off — they literally pay off — generics to keep the prices and the competition off the market,"" Klobuchar said. ""That’s bad, and we can fix it."" Klobuchar’s comment was one of the fundamental changes she said she would make to the health care system if elected president. She said ending the practice of pay-for-delay, as well as allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and importing less expensive drugs from countries like Canada, could help bring down pharmaceutical costs. Nearly 8 in 10 Americans believe drug prices are unreasonable, according to a recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) So it is little surprise that not only Klobuchar but also many presidential candidates are talking about drug costs. This practice of pay-for-delay sounds almost too shady to be real, so we decided to see if her claim checks out: Are pharmaceutical companies paying generic drugmakers to delay marketing their drugs, keeping prices high? Is that legal?  The back story on 'pay-for-delay' deals Yes, it is true that pharmaceutical companies compensate generic competitors to hold off on marketing their versions of brand-name drugs. It is also true that this practice results in delays before cheaper, generic drugs become available, leaving patients no choice but to pay for the pricier, brand-name drugs they have been prescribed. Take Humira, a blockbuster anti-inflammatory medication that treats diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. AbbVie has been accused of engaging in pay-for-delay deals to protect its claim on Humira, though the details of such settlements are secret. The drugmaker has stated on the record that it has not used pay-for-delay tactics with Humira. To understand this issue, it may help to know pay-for-delay deals by their wonkier name: ""reverse payment agreements."" Like many products, drugs are protected by patents. Before companies can sell a generic drug, they must certify they will not market it until any related patents have expired, or they can challenge the existing patents. Faced with a challenge to its patent, a brand-name manufacturer may, in turn, choose to sue the generic for patent infringement. Often the companies decide to settle, with the generic manufacturer agreeing to hold off on marketing its drug until a certain date in exchange for some form of compensation from the brand-name company — a ""reverse payment agreement"" — because rather than seeking damages, they agree to compensate the company they sued. The terms of these agreements, including the amount of money changing hands, are secret. Only the Federal Trade Commission knows how much they are worth — and the FTC says these deals result in Americans paying $3.5 billion in higher drug costs every year. While drugmakers could argue that the settlements help save on costly litigation, they effectively function as a payment to stay out of the marketplace, protecting the exclusivity and the bottom line of the brand-name drug and its manufacturer. In the past, that compensation usually came in the form of cash, said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who researches the effects of intellectual property laws on drug development. But cash payments are no longer as common. In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the FTC could scrutinize pay-for-delay agreements under antitrust laws as part of its mission to promote a competitive marketplace. Since then, the FTC has made opposing what it calls these ""anti-competitive deals"" one of its top priorities, taking dozens of companies to court. Thus, many drugmakers have changed strategies. Kesselheim said these deals have ""evolved"" since the Supreme Court’s decision, with fewer involving the transfer of cash. With the FTC considering cash payments a red flag for anti-competitive behavior, drugmakers may offer compensation in other forms — say, by sharing knowledge or agreeing to market one another’s drugs to doctors. That doesn’t help patients, Kesselheim said, as these agreements still delay lower-cost drugs from making their way to the pharmacy counter. ""From a patient’s point of view, they’re both kind of not good,"" he said. Both brand-name and generic drug manufacturers have long opposed a ban on pay-for-delay deals. But it looks as if their days are numbered, said Rodney Whitlock, a consultant and former Republican congressional staffer who was deeply involved in health policy. A handful of bills have been introduced in Congress to halt the practice, including one co-sponsored by Klobuchar and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. While it looks likely that Congress will pass a law to stop pay-for-delay, that does not necessarily mean the problem will go away. Passing legislation seems more likely than not, Whitlock said. But ""after that, it will be implementation, and will manufacturers find new ways of attaining the same end that we haven’t contemplated yet?"" Our ruling Klobuchar said, ""We can stop this horrible practice where big pharmaceuticals pay off – they literally pay off – generics to keep the prices and the competition off the market."" ""Pay-for-delay"" is a pharmaceutical industry practice that involves brand-name drugmakers compensating their generic counterparts for holding off on marketing their versions of brand-name drugs, causing longer delays in getting cheaper, generic drugs to the pharmacy counter. There are currently no federal laws explicitly barring these sorts of deals. Brand-name manufacturers do not in all cases ""literally pay off"" generic drugmakers. Since the Supreme Court ruled the FTC could challenge these agreements in court in 2013, cash payments have become less common, sometimes replaced by other forms of compensation. Klobuchar is clearly aware of this distinction. The legislation she introduced with Grassley notes that an agreement is in violation of their proposed ban if a drugmaker ""receives anything of value,"" not just cash. We rate this statement True. Update April 26, 2019: After this fact check's publication, AbbVie contacted us regarding the inclusion of its drug, Humira, in the text and provided a statement that it has not used pay-for-delay tactics. We clarified the story on these points. The broader point of the fact check about reverse payment agreements and Klobuchar's statement continue to rate as true.

"['Health Care', 'Health Check', 'Gavin Newsom']","
Newsom: California Leads On Prescription Drugs
","California regularly portrays itself as a national trendsetter on political issues, and Gov. Gavin Newsom is claiming that title on prescription drugs. Newsom has a plan to take on the drug industry, and at an April 17 news conference in Southern California, he declared that two other governors already want to join his effort. ""California is leading the nation in holding drug companies accountable and fighting prescription drug prices,"" Newsom said via a press release that day, marking his 100th full day in office. There’s no question the Democratic governor is aggressively taking on the pharmaceutical industry — vowing to leverage his state’s purchasing power to extract lower prices, and bluntly telling drugmakers that taxpayers are tired of being ""screwed."" But Newsom’s claim that California leads the nation on this issue prompted us to ask: Is that really the case? What is Newsom doing about prescription drugs? Newsom marked his first day in office, Jan. 7, with a direct message to the pharmaceutical industry: The nation’s most populous state is fed up with the meteoric rise in prescription drug prices. He signed an executive order directing the state to negotiate drug prices for the roughly 13 million enrollees of Medi-Cal, the country’s largest Medicaid program that serves low-income residents, by 2021. And he ordered his administration to study how state agencies could band together and buy prescription drugs in bulk. With the state buying drugs for all Medi-Cal enrollees and state entities, Newsom argues that California will leverage its purchasing power as the third-largest buyer in the country to demand lower prices from drugmakers. Eventually, Newsom envisions private purchasers — including small businesses, health plans and self-insured Californians — taking part. Newsom has said several times he hopes this collaboration can be a model for the rest of the country. Newsom traveled to Downey, Calif., last week to announce that Los Angeles County would join California’s bulk purchasing pool, a move intended to show that others are eager to join his initiative. How do California’s efforts on prescription drugs compare with those of other states? We interviewed five health care experts who commended Newsom for his focus on prescription drugs, but each noted that he is not the only lawmaker tackling the issue. ""Is California a leader? Yes. Is it the leader?"" asked Edwin Park, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. ""That’s not doing an assessment of what all the other states are doing."" A number of states in recent years have enacted laws to regulate pharmacy benefit managers, the so-called middlemen who negotiate with drugmakers; impose drug price transparency rules; outlaw ""gag clauses"" that prevent pharmacists from telling consumers about cheaper drug alternatives; and authorize the importation of drugs from Canada. At least 28 states and the District of Columbia already participate in multistate purchasing pools — joining forces to get bigger discounts for their Medicaid programs or state employees. The Northwest Prescription Drug Consortium, formed by Oregon and Washington in 2006, invites state and local government agencies, businesses, labor unions and uninsured consumers to voluntarily pool their purchasing power. Roughly 1.1 million people are represented by the consortium, either as individuals or through public and private entities such as the Washington State Department of Corrections, Washington’s Medicaid program and SAIF Corp. ""Other states are actively looking at us as a partner,"" said Trevor Douglass, director of the Oregon Prescription Drug Program. Earlier this month, Maryland lawmakers passed legislation that would create the nation’s first prescription drug affordability board, which, if signed by Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, would let the state cap certain drug prices. ""There’s extraordinary activity"" on prescription drug prices, said Trish Riley, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy, which tracks bills in state legislatures around the country. ""Hundreds of bills were introduced this year."" What makes California’s effort novel, Newsom spokesman Nathan Click said, is the mandatory inclusion of all state agencies and the Medi-Cal program — which he said would make it the largest purchaser of drugs after Medicare and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Programs in other states are more limited, and some are voluntary. Health care experts agreed that California’s size by default makes it a national leader on the health care front, not the national leader. But if California is successful, they say, it could lower the price of drugs nationally. Our ruling Newsom said ""California is leading the nation in holding drug companies accountable and fighting prescription drug prices."" States across the county are addressing the rising cost of prescription drugs in a variety of ways. California is not the only, or the first, one. The scope of what Newsom is attempting could bring down drug prices for California residents, and possibly residents in other states that join the effort. But Newsom’s sweeping plan is still in its infancy with many details pending, so it’s too soon to gauge success. We rate the claim HALF TRUE.

Rushing is right: half of NC9 Republicans don't live in the district
","In a field of 10 candidates, Stony Rushing has gone to creative lengths to stand out. Rushing, a Union County commissioner, must beat out nine other Republicans to be the party’s candidate in a special election for North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District. (The NC elections board nullified the November election results after finding they were tainted by an operative working for Republican candidate Mark Harris.) Rushing, a Wingate resident who once dressed as the corrupt Boss Hogg character from ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" show, initially gained attention by earning Harris’ endorsement in the wake of the probe. Rushing has since appeared in a campaign ad with a snake wrapped around his neck, and challenged the sincerity of his opponents. Some candidates, Rushing said recently, are far apart from voters not only in philosophy — but geography. ""In a crowded field of candidates where 5 out of 10 (candidates) do not live or vote in the 9th District, only Stony Rushing is still fighting for your vote to matter,"" the Rushing campaign said in an April 9 Facebook post. The race includes 13 total candidates: 10 Republicans, a Democrat, a Libertarian and a Green Party candidate. Rushing’s Facebook post linked to a story about a debate between the Republican candidates, so it’s clear Rushing was referring to GOP candidates. To run for U.S. House, the law doesn’t require candidates to live in a specific district, as PolitiFact has previously reported. (The Constitution says House members must live in the state they represent, however.) Rushing, for his part, raised the issue because he thinks candidates who live in the district have a better understanding of its needs than those who don’t. The 9th district covers more ground than some of North Carolina’s 12 other congressional districts, stretching across eight counties from Charlotte to Fayetteville and encompassing about 770,000 people. Conrad Pogorzelski, Rushing’s spokesman, said the district includes a large swath of NC’s banking industry in Charlotte, military personnel near Fayetteville and agriculture in between. So we wondered about Rushing’s claim. As it turns out, he’s right. WHERE THEY LIVE When reached by PolitiFact, Rushing spokesman Pogorzelski cited the addresses candidates filedwith the NC elections board. To find out which congressional district each candidate lives in, we plugged each address into the elections board’s ""voter lookup"" tool. Matthew Ridenhour and Dan Bishop of Charlotte, as well as Gary Dunn of Matthews and Fern Shubert of Marshville, all live in the district with Rushing. (So do Democrat Dan McCready, Green Party candidate Allen Smith and Libertarian candidate Jeff Scott.) The following candidates live outside the district: Brown, Day and Hull live near the district, while Anglin and Wiley are the farthest away. Wiley lives in the 3rd district, which sprawls down North Carolina’s coast, where there’s a separate special election. NOT UNCOMMON In the 3rd district, longtime Rep. Walter Jones died earlier this year and 26 candidates filed to run for his seat, including 17 Republicans. Three of those Republicans — Graham Boyd of Wake Forest, Jeff Moore of Raleigh and Francis De Luca of Cary — live outside the district. So do Democrat Ernest Reeves and Libertarian Shannon Bray. In District 3, the election schedule calls for the primary on April 30, the general election or primary runoff on July 9, and, if a runoff is needed, a Sept. 10 general election. Back to Rushing’s race in District 9, the primary is set for May 14 and the general election is scheduled for Sept. 10. If no candidate wins more than 30 percent of the vote in the primary, a runoff election will be held Sept. 10 and the general election will follow on Nov. 5. OUR RULING Rushing said five of the 10 Republican candidates in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District live outside the district boundaries. North Carolinians by law aren’t prohibited from running in a congressional district that’s not their own. And some of the candidates who reside outside the district live nearby. But, Rushing is right. We rate this claim True. Staff reporter Carli Brosseau contributed.

TV ad misleads on Florida plan to import drugs from Canada
","As the Florida Legislature moves toward creating a program to import prescription drugs from Canada, an opponent’s TV ad says the legislation could have deadly consequences. ""State senators are pushing a new government program that allows prescription drugs from China without FDA inspection,"" says the narrator in the April ad. ""An FDA commissioner warned these drugs come from ‘unreliable parties and counterfeiters.’ The Wall Street Journal calls it ‘impractical, unsafe and unlikely to reduce prices.’ Too many have already died from counterfeit drugs -- are you willing to take that risk?"" The ad directs viewers to tell their senators to vote against Senate Bill 1528. The message is from The Partnership for Safe Medicines, comprised of dozens of groups including Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, the lobbying group that includes major drug companies. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis is a key advocate for the bill. He disputes the ad’s message. ""You think I’m just going to, like, bring in a bunch of drugs from Pakistan and off the street?"" he said in an April 23 speech to the AARP. ""The safety is going to be there, and if it’s not there, then we wouldn’t want to do it."" PolitiFact found no evidence to support the idea that Florida legislators want to import drugs from China with no oversight from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The ad says that the program would allow imported drugs from China, but the legislation calls for importing drugs from Canada. ""The FDA has the power to regulate any drugs sold in this country, regardless of where the drugs originated,"" said Robin Feldman, University of California Hastings law professor. ""Safety is key to the FDA’s mission, and that mission encompasses drugs imported from other countries, as well as drugs sold directly here."" The legislation has moved forward in Senate committees, and a similar bill in the House passed 93-22 on April 11. Supporters say that it will lead to lower prices for consumers who struggle to pay for medicines. Opponents cast doubt about whether it will truly save money, and a conservative group, Americans for Tax Reform, called the bill ""socialist price controls."" (The ad correctly quoted the Wall Street Journal editorial board criticizing the plan.) SB 1528 would require the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration to establish a program to allow a vendor to import wholesale drugs into Florida pharmacies. In theory, the federal government has a path to create such a program. A provision in a 2003 federal law empowers the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to approve state programs for wholesalers or pharmacies to import medications from Canada. Importers must comply with federal safeguards, including that the drugs be tested, and HHS would have to certify to Congress that the program poses no additional safety risk. No HHS secretary has ever issued such an approval. Vermont, which passed drug importation legislation in 2018, plans to submit a proposal to HHS this year. The ad omits that SB 1528 does have safety provisions, including that the drugs must meet the FDA’s standards and entities involved would be subject to state rules, according to Senate staff analysis of the bill. There are safeguards on the Canadian side, too. Under Canadian law, exporters must attest that the item is legal and complies with inspections of the destination country. Foreign drugs are already in the U.S. The FDA estimates that 80% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients and 40% of the actual finished drugs in the U.S. market are manufactured in FDA-registered facilities in other countries, primarily India and China. Importing drugs from Canada or other countries has been a common practice in the United States for many years. Surveys indicate that up to 8% of Americans have bought medicines outside the country, even though the practice is technically illegal. Americans buy the drugs for personal use either by driving across the border to Canada or Mexico or by purchasing them on the internet. Local governments or schools, including in Florida, have helped their employees buy cheaper drugs from Canada or overseas. The Partnership for Safe Medicines points to cases showing that foreign counterfeit medicines are already in the United States. For example, three Texans were prosecuted for importing 100,000 pills from China, and a Chinese drug importer distributed counterfeit drugs in the U.S. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and four past FDA commissioners have raised concerns that entities claim to sell Canadian drugs actually obtained the drugs from elsewhere. For example, in the 2005 FDA sting operation ""Bait and Switch"" the FDA found that drugs being promoted as Canadian, the vast majority came from other countries and many were counterfeit. More recently, the online pharmacy Canada Drugs was fined $34 million in 2018 for importing counterfeit cancer drugs and other unapproved pharmaceuticals to health care providers. These illegal operations are cause for concern, but those happened before Florida proposed a more structured, regulated importation program. Juliette Cubanski, an expert on Medicare policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that the question is whether it’s possible to create a 100% foolproof system. If drugs are imported from facilities in Canada that are certified by FDA-equivalent authorities in Canada, that would be safer than ordering drugs online from a website that purports to be a Canadian pharmacy. ""It seems that what Florida and other states who are interested in drug importation are intending is to create safe, legitimate pathways for their residents to import prescription drugs from abroad,"" she said. An ad by Partnership for Safe Medicines said, ""State senators are pushing a new government program that allows prescription drugs from China without FDA inspection."" Senators are actually pushing for an importation program from Canada, not China. In its ad, the organization points to evidence of unscrupulous entities that purported to provide prescriptions from Canada but were actually obtaining drugs from elsewhere or counterfeit operations. Those cases are real, but it doesn’t mean that a proposed Florida program will allow prescription drugs from China without federal oversight. The Florida program would require the federal government’s approval, including state and federal safeguards, including those that involve the FDA. We rate this claim False.  ",/factchecks/2019/apr/25/partnership-safe-medicines/tv-ad-misleads-florida-plan-import-drugs-canada/

Is most home care paid by government programs?
","For the aging and those with long-term care needs, receiving care at home is more affordable than institutionalized facilities like hospitals or nursing homes. But presidential candidate John Delaney argued on Twitter that even with jobs growing in the home care industry, workers are struggling with low wages because ""most of home care is paid by government programs, which don’t pay enough."" Is home care really funded mostly by government programs? We decided to check. Delaney, a former Maryland congressman, got his numbers from a factsheet from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, his campaign spokesperson Will McDonald told PolitiFact. The factsheet stated that ""Medicare and Medicaid together made up 76 percent of home health spending in 2017."" Medicare paid a total of $38.7 billion, followed by Medicaid, which paid for over $35 billion, according to the 2017 data. Government programs, including Medicaid, Medicare, Department of Veteran Affairs programs, state and local programs, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program spent $75.2 billion on home health care. Together, they add up to 78% of total home health care spending. Most of the money spent on home health care went to skilled medical care. However, those numbers don’t capture another big part of the spending on care at home: long-term, non-medical unskilled care. This unskilled care includes things like assistance with bathing, cooking, eating, using the toilet, dressing, shopping, and chores. These services are usually for seniors and people with illness and disabilities. Medicare, for instance, only covers short-term, intermittent unskilled care concurrently with the medical care people receive from therapists and nurses, for less than 8 hours a day up to a period of 60 days, according to the government. That’s part of Medicare’s home health spending of $38.7 billion in 2017. But for long-term unskilled care, Medicare doesn’t pay at all. And Medicaid pays for long-term unskilled care only in some cases. Excluding medical care, Medicaid spent $76.9 billion on home and community-based long-term care in fiscal 2017, a survey of Medicaid programs by the Kaiser Family Foundation suggested. ""Medicaid is the only program that covers some of this non-medical long-term care under certain circumstances for people who have spent down their assets"", said Ani Turner, co-director of Sustainable Health Spending Strategies at Altarum, a nonprofit research organization. Long-term unskilled care at home is paid for by out-of-pocket private payers, long-term care insurance, or by Medicaid, for those who qualify based on states’ eligibility standards for low income, said Regina Shih, Ph.D., Senior Policy Researcher at the non-profit RAND Corporation, who studies Long-Term Services and Supports. How much is spent on long-term unskilled care at home by all payers? We don’t know. Despite a booming private home care industry, ""the full size and range of private pay just hasn't really been captured,"" Spillman said. For the elderly who are not institutionalized, government programs pay less than 30% of their home and community care bills. A Department of Health and Human Services policy brief estimated that people turning 65 between 2015 and 2019 will pay 68.6% of their home or residential care costs out-of-pocket. Still, Delaney made a valid point about wages, experts said. ""Since the government is paying for a large share of home health care services,"" Turner said, ""the reimbursement rates paid under these government programs strongly influence what home health agencies can afford to pay their workers."" There's one final point to consider when we tabulate the dollars spent on in-home care. Formally reported spending on long-term services and support underestimates total expenditures, noted the report by the Congressional Research Service. A lot of non-medical in-home care was shouldered by family caregivers, who are often uncompensated, said Shih. ""This reliance on unpaid caregivers while governments are trying to curb (Long-Term Services and Supports) costs is why caring for older adults and those with disability in our nation is a crisis,"" Shih said. Delaney said that ""Most of home care is paid by government programs."" Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP are the largest payers of total medical care at home. However, the current data doesn’t capture the mix of spending that includes long-term non-medical home care, for things like shopping, bathing and other everyday chores. Based on the available data, we rate this statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/apr/25/john-delaney/most-home-care-government-funded/

Nick Schroer wrong that more women have died from legal abortions since Roe v. Wade
","On an episode of Politically Speaking, a podcast from St. Louis Public Radio, O’Fallon Rep. Nick Schroer spoke about legislation he sponsored known as the ""Missouri Stands for the Unborn Act"". The bill, which would ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat or brain activity is detected, is considered one of the ""strongest pro-life"" bills in the nation. Interviewer Jason Rosenbaum asked Schroer how he responds to opponents of his bill who say this will prompt women past the 6 to 8 week mark in their pregnancy when a heartbeat or brain activity could be detected to obtain a dangerous abortion. Schroer responded by saying statistics that measured the number of women who died from illegal abortions prior to the nationwide legalization of abortion in Roe v. Wade in 1973 were fabricated and overestimated. Schroer said, ""There are statistics out there that show the number of women who died from illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade, that number has skyrocketed since with women dying more with legal abortions.""After further investigation, we found that Schroer’s claim was misleading. We reached out to Schroer to find out where he got the information about the number of women dying from legal abortions. In his reply, Schroer said, ""This quote was meant to pull in the numbers of female babies as well."" ""Since Roe v. Wade, the number of babies killed, male and female, has skyrocketed per this information. Whether mother or female baby, the amount of life lost as a result of abortion since Roe has skyrocketed,"" he said. None of that is clear from Schroer’s answer on the podcast, and it has nothing to do with the question he was asked -- which was about pregnant women. So what do we know about outcomes of pregnant women seeking an abortion pre-Roe v. Wade? And have deaths of pregnant women seeking an abortion been increasing or decreasing? Karissa Haugeberg, assistant professor of history at Tulane University, said, ""It can be difficult to get at precise deaths due to illegal abortions because many physicians and pathologists obscured the cause of death on death certificates to protect providers and women’s families."" Many of these deaths would be reported as a miscarriage or other complication in the pregnancy. The Guttmacher Institute outlines the number of abortion deaths prior to Roe v. Wade, with abortion being the official cause of death for almost 2,700 women in 1930, 1,700 women in 1940 and over 300 women in 1950. The institute also says the actual number was likely much higher. In her book ""When Abortion Was a Crime,"" Leslie J. Reagan said, ""The same developments that finally reduced the mortality associated with childbirth reduced the mortality due to abortion."" Medical developments such as the use of blood transfusions and antibiotics made every medical procedure, including abortion, more safe. Antibiotics were widely introduced in After Roe v. Wade, the number of deaths caused by abortions continued to drop. The Center for Disease Control’s 1992 Abortion Surveillance report outlined the number of deaths from legal and illegal abortions from 1972, one year before Roe v. Wade, to 1990. Over this time period, the number of deaths from both legal and illegal abortions dropped. In 1972, the case-fatality rate was 4.1 percent; by 1976, it had dropped to 1.1 percent.  According to the CDC, ""in 2014, the most recent year for which data were available, six women were identified to have died as a result of complications from legal induced abortion."" Schroer said the number of women dying from legal abortions has ""skyrocketed"" compared to illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade. Schroer said he was talking about pregnant women and female fetuses, though that wasn’t the question he was asked and is extremely misleading to listeners. The number of women who have died from abortions has steadily decreased, even prior to the decision in Roe v. Wade.

Does Texas Have a Veterans Treatment Court In Each County?
","Missouri Rep. Dave Griffith, R-Jefferson City, proposed a bill that would require the establishment of more veterans treatment courts in Missouri. ""Every county in the state of Texas has a veterans court,"" he said in a Feb. 12 judiciary committee hearing on veterans treatment courts. According to previous Missourian reporting, Griffith, vice chairman of the Veterans Committee and former Green Beret of the U.S. Army 8th Special Forces Group, said that more veteran treatment courts would make it easier for veterans to reach a court, because some have to drive ""a great deal of a distance"" to follow their program every day. According to Justice for Vets, veterans treatment courts are special courts that provide an alternative to incarceration, offering programs to help veterans in the criminal justice system because of substance abuse or mental health disorders get the help and treatment they need. We decided to take a closer look at Griffith’s statement, to check if each county in the state of Texas has a veterans treatment court. When we asked Griffith about his claim, he said he was referring to what he learned from talking with the administrative assistant of the Gonzales County judge in Texas. Griffith said he was deployed to assist following Hurricane Harvey in the fall of 2017. He worked worked in three counties including Gonzales County. ""I talked with the judge and his administrative assistant,"" Griffith said. ""His assistant informed me that every county in the state of Texas has a veterans court."" We reached out to Gonzales County to find out more. County Judge C. Patrick Davis took over from Judge David Bird at the beginning of the year. Davis referred us to Chapter 124 of the Texas Government Code, untitled Veterans Treatment Court Program. But neither this passage of the Texas law nor the judge provided any comment on the number of veterans treatment courts in Texas. According to Texvet, treatment courts are available to veterans across 39 counties in Texas. There are 254 counties in Texas, far more than any other state. Texvet is an initiative of Texas A&M University, which connects veterans and their families to resources and services. When we informed Griffith about our research, he said he didn't have any reason not to believe what the assistant told him. He told us he didn’t check if every county in Texas has a veterans court but still thinks it’s true. He clarified: ""Perhaps she was just talking about the counties that were surrounding San Antonio and the counties around there. But I took it as every county in the state had a veterans court."" According to Veterans Treatment Courts: 2015 Survey Results, a new report by the Justice Programs Office at American University’s School of Public Affairs, Texas had 17 veterans treatment courts programs as of July 2016. According to the same survey, Michigan had the most at 22. According to the National Center for State Courts, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs counted 461 veteran-focused court programs in the U.S. as of June 30, 2016. Holly Shive, communications coordinator for TexVet, and David B. Tucy, Gonzales Veterans County service officer, did not respond to requests for comment. Griffith said, ""Every county in the state of Texas has a veterans court."" Based on data for veterans courts, Texas does not have anywhere near 254 veterans courts, the number of counties in the state.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Pete Buttigieg']","
Is Pete Buttigieg's time as mayor more executive experience than Mike Pence's time as governor, VP?
","At a CNN town hall, the first question posed to Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., gave him a chance to answer criticism about his qualifications to serve in the Oval Office. The audience member began with a reference to the host of Comedy Central’s ""The Daily Show"" and to President Donald Trump. Then there was this exchange: Question: ""So, in a recent comedy piece, Trevor Noah said that you were the exact opposite of Trump in many regards, going so far as to say that you were the anti-Trump. However, similar to Trump, you lack experience in state and federal governance. If elected, how would you use this lack of experience as an advantage?"" Buttigieg: ""Well, first of all, in many ways, experience is my answer to the question of age. I get that my experience is not the most conventional for somebody running for president, but unlike this president, I have experience in government. As I often point out, I’ve got not only more experience in government than the president, but more executive experience than the vice president, more military experience than anybody who's come into that office since George H.W. Bush."" It’s well known that prior to serving in the White House, Trump had no prior government experience. And we’ve rated Buttigieg’s military claim as True. Now let’s look at whether Buttigieg has more executive experience than his fellow Hoosier, Vice President Mike Pence. It’s a claim he has made repeatedly for months. To back Buttigieg’s statement, his campaign simply pointed out to Buttigieg’s tenure as mayor of his native South Bend, home of University of Notre Dame and the National Studebaker Museum, and to Pence’s tenure as Indiana’s governor. Buttigieg, who is 37, is serving his second term as mayor. He has held the post since January 2012, except for a six-month leave-of-absence in 2014 when he was deployed to Afghanistan as a member of the U.S. Navy Reserve. (Buttigieg announced in December 2018 he would not seek a third term.) Pence, 59, was inaugurated as governor in January 2013 and served until his term ended in January 2017, even though he had become Trump’s running mate in July 2016. All of that was after Pence had served 12 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, where for two years (2009 to 2011) he was chairman of the House Republican Conference. Buttigieg’s campaign argues that Buttigieg’s nearly 7½ years as mayor gives him more executive experience than Pence’s four years as governor. South Bend has a ""strong mayor"" form of government, which means the mayor is the elected chief executive running the city, as opposed to cities where the mayor has a lesser role and the day-to-day administration is handled by a hired city manager. But, obviously, serving as mayor of a city of about 100,000 people with a 2019 budget of $368 million isn’t the same as serving as governor of a state with 6.7 million people. The last two-year state budget signed by Pence, in 2015, was for $31 billion. Moreover, Pence has now served for more than two years in a rather major  executive branch office — vice president. The response from the Buttigieg campaign to us indicates Buttigieg was referring to executive experience in elected office. But we’ll note that Buttigieg was an officer from 2009 to 2017 in the U.S. Navy Reserve. And Pence served as president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, a conservative think tank, from 1991 to 1993. ""Pence’s two jobs have been heavier hitters,"" said Margaret O'Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington whose specialties include the modern presidency, referring to Pence’s time as governor and vice president. ""The bottom line, however, is that no job truly prepares a person to become U.S. president — it is a job unlike any other, and one that every occupant has had to learn to master while already in office."" Using a baseball analogy, Jerald Podair, professor of history and American studies at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis., was more blunt. ""When all is said and done, Mayor Pete is no different than thousands of mayors of mid-size cities,"" Podair said. ""His experience is Triple-A at best. Pence’s is major league."" Buttigieg says he has ""more executive experience than the vice president."" In terms of No. 1-in-charge jobs, Buttigieg’s seven-plus years as the mayor of South Bend, Ind., exceeds the four years Pence served as governor of Indiana. But the scope of Pence’s duties was wider as governor. Moreover, even though it’s a No. 2 position, Pence’s two-plus years as vice president obviously count as high-level executive-branch experience as well. The statement has element of truth but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate Buttigieg’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/apr/24/pete-buttigieg/pete-buttigiegs-8-years-mayor-more-executive-exper/
"['Elections', 'Vermont', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Bernie Sanders set off a firestorm over prisoners voting, but his facts are straight
","In comments that flooded national headlines, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said Monday night that he believes all prisoners — including ""terrible people"" like the Boston Marathon bomber — should be allowed to vote. He said people serving time, no matter how serious their offense, deserve enfranchisement. ""I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy,"" Sanders said. ""Yes, even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away and you say that person committed a terrible crime, not gonna let him vote, or that person did that, not gonna let that person vote — you’re running down a slippery slope."" The debate over whether released felons should vote was at the center of recent election in Florida. ""When they get out of jail, they certainly should have the right to vote,"" Sanders said this week. ""I do believe that even if they are in jail, they’re paying their price to society, but that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy."" Sanders said this ideal has been the reality in Vermont since the state’s founding. ""In my own state of Vermont, from the very first days of our state’s history, what our Constitution says is that everybody can vote,"" he said. ""That is true. So people in jail can vote."" It’s certainly true that all of Vermont’s prisoners currently enjoy the right to vote, but has that been true since day 1 of the state’s founding? The Sanders camp said it could not immediately reply to questions about the candidate’s claim. Vermont is one of just two states, the other being Maine, where prisoners currently have the right to vote. The Burlington Free Press described Vermont’s prison voting system in an article following on Sanders’ remarks. Even prisoners being held out-of-state in Mississippi are given the opportunity to cast ballots in their most recent ""voluntary"" address back home.  Dylan Lynch, a policy associate from the National Conference on State Legislatures, noted that four other states introduced legislation this year that would allow people to vote while incarcerated for a felony. In Connecticut, the measure failed, but in Louisiana, Massachusetts and New Jersey, bills are still pending. It’s also true that Vermont has allowed incarcerated people to vote since its founding. Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos confirmed that incarcerated Vermonters have ""never had their right to vote taken away during incarceration."" In the 1790s, the Vermont Legislature tried to outlaw inmate voting, but it was overruled in a 1799 decision by the Council of Censors, a ""now-defunct fourth branch of government that met every seven years to decide constitutional questions,"" according to a 2008 Associated Press story. Vermont’s 1793 Constitution was interpreted to mean that the loss of voting rights could only occur in response to voter fraud. That case was cited as precedent as recently as the 1980s, in the most recent attempt to outlaw inmate voting in Vermont. Vermont’s current Constitution states that every person who is 18 years old and a citizen of the United States, ""having resided in this State for the period established by the General Assembly and who is of a quiet and peaceable behavior … shall be entitled to all the privileges of a voter of this state."" Sean Morales-Doyle, a lawyer with the Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan public policy institute, said there are certain phrases about voting that are common in state Constitutions, but that being of ""quiet and peaceable behavior"" is not one of them, making it difficult to know exactly what it means. But he said specific laws around inmate voting, as opposed to the language in state constitutions, often decided whether prisoners can cast ballots. Morales-Doyle said the timing of when disenfranchisement for prisoners was codified in states’ laws is far from random. Before the passage of the 15th Amendment guaranteeing men the right to vote regardless of race, Morales-Doyle said very few states bothered to disenfranchise prisoners. But after the amendment passed, he said there was a wave of states that passed laws or amendments to take away prisoners’ right to vote. He said the fact that 48 states still don’t allow incarcerated people to vote is unquestionably a relic of Jim Crow-era laws. But, Morales-Doyle said, after Florida’s 2018 vote to enfranchise felons who have completed their sentences, there has been an increased interest in efforts to return voting rights to people across the criminal justice system. In Vermont, though, even having total enfranchisement for prisoners still leaves a narrower field of voters than there once was. Peter Teachout, a professor at Vermont Law School, said from 1777 to 1824, the state was ""so hungry for voters"" that even non-U.S. citizens had the right to vote in Vermont. (Vermont’s capital city voted last year to allow non-citizens to vote once again, a charter change now being debated in the state Legislature.) The question that cannot be answered is whether Vermont’s prisoners actually employed their Constitutional rights throughout history. Condos said the state doesn’t track how many incarcerated Vermonters vote. Rather, they appear on the voter checklist in the same manner as all other voters. Condos said there’s very little evidence to suggest inmates in Vermont institutions were historically able to exercise that right. ""That doesn’t mean it’s not the case, only that we have yet to find any evidence of it,"" Condos said. ""Voting is the bedrock of our democracy, and we have worked hard to ensure that we’re breaking down barriers for eligible voters to register and cast their ballots."" Sanders said: ""In my own state of Vermont, from the very first days of our state’s history, what our Constitution says is that everybody can vote. That is true. So people in jail can vote."" It’s true that Vermont felons can vote from prison today, and we can’t find anything to suggest that hasn’t always been the case in the state. Though it seems quite possible that the efforts being made today to allow them to cast ballots hasn’t always been made. The Vermont Constitution requires people to be of ""quiet and peaceable behavior,"" but otherwise places no restrictions on who can vote.

"['West Virginia', 'Joe Manchin']","
Is Joe Manchin the only senator to consistently vote against the nuclear option?
","For decades, majority leaders in the U.S. Senate have threatened to use the ""nuclear option"" to change senators’ ability to filibuster, a maneuver that blocks bills from coming to a vote unless a supermajority of the chamber votes to proceed. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is one member of the body who has fought to protect the status quo. In a recent tweet, Manchin said, ""I was the only member of the Senate – Republican or Democrat – who has consistently voted against efforts to use the so called ‘nuclear option’ to change the rules of the Senate. This move is a betrayal of the people we represent."" #ICYMI: I was the only member of the Senate – Republican or Democrat – who has consistently voted against efforts to use the so called “nuclear option” to change the rules of the Senate. This move is a betrayal of the people we represent. MORE: https://t.co/qLLf42TaFG We wondered whether Manchin was right that he had a uniquely consistent record on such votes. So we reached out to two experts in Senate procedure to see whether Manchin’s statement was accurate. (Manchin’s office did not respond to an inquiry.) First, some background on the nuclear option. As we’ve previously noted, there is a legend of uncertain veracity that says George Washington and Thomas Jefferson came to agree that the Senate should serve as a ""saucer"" to the House’s ""tea cup"" — a vessel for cooling the passions emanating from the House. Whether the specifics of the tale hold up, the idea that the Senate is the slower, more cautious half of Congress has been the chamber’s reputation throughout its history. The Constitution delegates internal rule-setting to the Senate itself, and for much of its history, the chamber — unlike the House — did not implement any mechanism to maneuver around a member who was determined enough to block action through a filibuster. In 1917, the Senate voted to empower a supermajority of two-thirds to cut off a filibuster and move on to other business by invoking a motion known as ""cloture."" (Since the Senate had 96 members then, that meant 64 were needed to invoke cloture if all members were voting.) Then, in 1975, the Senate voted to lower the supermajority to its current number, 60 out of 100 members. Still, 60 votes is a significant hurdle for a chamber that has not often had one party win that many seats. In recent years, the two parties have become more polarized, and more willing to filibuster, even on matters that had previously been treated as routine. That has put pressure on Senate leaders to get rid of the longstanding supermajority hurdle or else face gridlock -- especially for such high-stakes topics as nominations. Detractors have warned that such important matters were better dealt with using the higher degree of consensus conveyed through a 60-vote supermajority. But there is one tool available to a Senate leader willing to buck the chamber’s long standing tradition: the nuclear option. The mechanics of the nuclear option (which has nothing to do with anything literally nuclear) are complex even by the standards of parliamentary maneuvers, requiring a precise series of carefully choreographed steps. Readers brave enough to tackle the details can refer to multi-page explanations in these two reports by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The gist, though, is that the majority party would move to change the supermajority rule through a series of votes that require only a simple majority. Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist, cited four key votes for the nuclear option. One came in 2013, when the Democrats were in control, one came in 2017, when Republicans were in control, and the final one came in 2019, when the Republicans were still in control. In 2013, the Democratic leadership used the nuclear option to get rid of the filibuster for all nominations except Supreme Court appointments. Manchin voted against his own party, to keep the status quo. In 2017, Republicans leaders called a vote to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations. Here, Manchin cast a vote to maintain the status quo, siding with Democrats against the Republican majority seeking to go nuclear. Then, in 2019, Republican leaders offered two relevant votes. While they weren’t specifically about filibusters, they addressed delaying tactics that can advantage the minority. One vote would shorten the debate time after cloture from 30 hours to 2 hours for district judges. The second would do the same for non-Cabinet executive appointments. In both cases, Manchin voted to maintain the status quo. In 2013, two fellow Democratic senators voted with Manchin and against their party’s leadership -- then-Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan and Mark Pryor of Arkansas. Neither remains in the chamber. And two Republicans who voted with Democrats in the 2019 votes had stuck with their own party in the 2017 vote, meaning that their voting record wasn’t ""consistent"" with the status quo in all cases. Manchin said, ""I was the only member of the Senate – Republican or Democrat – who has consistently voted against efforts to use the so called ‘nuclear option’ to change the rules of the Senate."" Experts in Senate procedure tell PolitiFact that Manchin is correct, having voted in favor of the status quo -- and against ""nuclear option"" efforts -- in each of the four relevant votes between 2013 and 2019.

Have exports from West Virginia risen faster than the U.S. as a whole?
","Have West Virginia exports been on fire recently? A tweet by the West Virginia Republican Party suggests so. In an April 2 tweet, the state party said, ""West Virginia’s exports increased for the second year in a row in 2018, reaching $8.1 billion. Additionally, West Virginia’s export growth rate was 14.2%, nearly double the national average of 7.6%."" West Virginia’s exports increased for the second year in a row in 2018, reaching $8.1 billion. Additionally, West Virginia’s export growth rate was 14.2%, nearly double the national average of 7.6%. https://t.co/PW0hpM1e8z Did West Virginia really outpace the national average of export growth rates? The tweet linked to a March 17 article in WVNews. In turn, the article cites a March 15 news release by the West Virginia Department of Commerce that reported data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Caitlin Ashley-Lizarraga, an international trade specialist at the West Virginia Department of Commerce, pointed us to detailed Census Bureau data collected by a private-sector subscription database, the Global Trade Atlas. The table shows that West Virginia did indeed export $8.1 billion to the rest of the world in 2018, and that represented a 14.2% increase over the export total for 2017. The increase for the nation as a whole was a little over half that -- 7.6%. We were able to replicate this data using the Census Bureau’s own USA Trade Online data portal. While the export growth in West Virginia was strong between 2017 and 2018, it’s worth noting that this expansion came from a small base. In fact, West Virginia ranks thirteenth from the bottom in total exports for 2018. The states ranking below West Virginia are Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, ""West Virginia’s exports increased for the second year in a row in 2018, reaching $8.1 billion.

Does West Virginia trail its neighbors in STEM graduates?
","Is West Virginia trailing its neighbors in science, technology, engineering and math in higher education? West Virginia University President E. Gordon Gee said so during his State of the University address on March 19. ""Our state has fewer science, technology, engineering and math graduates than any neighboring state,"" Gee said. We decided to see if Gee was correct. We defined a ""neighboring state"" as one that shares a border with West Virginia: Maryland, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. To support his assertion, Gee’s office referred us to a website run by a corporate-location consulting firm called the Site Selection Group. The site provides statistics for STEM degrees conferred in 2016. Using raw numbers of graduates, Gee is correct: West Virginia conferred 4,912 STEM degrees, which is smaller than the neighboring five states. The second-smallest was Kentucky, with 8,252 degrees. However, looking just at raw numbers of graduates is misleading because West Virginia has a smaller population than any of the other states. To cancel out the effect of population, we also looked at the percentage of all degrees conferred in the state that were for STEM fields. On this measure, West Virginia ranks last among nearby states, too, though the comparison is closer. (We used data from the federal Department of Education that combines associate, bachelor’s, master’s and doctorates conferred in each state for 2015-2016.) We found that 16 percent of West Virginia’s degrees came in STEM fields, close to -- but behind -- Virginia at 17 percent and Kentucky, Ohio, and Pennsylvania at 18 percent. Maryland was the clear leader with 23 percent.  Gee said, ""Our state has fewer science, technology, engineering, and math graduates than any neighboring state."" He’s right both on the raw numbers and as a percentage of all degrees granted, though measuring by percentage, it’s a pretty close competition.
