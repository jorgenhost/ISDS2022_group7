Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton plan would tax small businesses at nearly 50 percent
","Donald Trump focused on the economy during an Aug. 8 speech in Detroit, saying he would soon be releasing details of a new economic plan. In the meantime, he launched an attack on his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, saying her economic plan was going to pose serious problems for small businesses. ""Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost 50 percent,"" he said, adding later in his speech, ""Under my plan, no American company will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes. In other words we're reducing your taxes from 35 percent to 15 percent. Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. Hillary Clinton's plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I'm proposing."" We wondered whether a Clinton presidency meant that small businesses would be paying nearly half their income to the federal government. But first, a word about small businesses. Most of us think of small businesses as businesses with a handful of employees, such as the corner grocery store, the local gasoline station or a nearby restaurant. Yet according to the government's definition, about 97 percent of all United States companies are classified as small by the Small Business Administration. In some sectors, you can have 1,500 employees or gross income of up to $38.5 million and still be considered a small business. (The IRS has its own set of rules.) When we asked the Trump campaign about the ""almost 50 percent"" claim, spokesman Dan Kowalski sent us a breakdown. Currently the top tax rate is 39.6 percent. Add 3.8 percent that a business owner could potentially be paying in Medicare taxes and you get 43.4 percent. That's under the current system. Clinton is proposing a 4 percent surcharge on high earners. That would bring the total tax rate to 47.4 percent, which is where the Trump campaign gets its ""almost 50 percent"" claim. ""This rate would apply to virtually any small business with substantial income, regardless of industry,"" Kowalski said, and he referred us to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. We contacted the center, where senior fellow Roberton Williams said Trump's percentages were correct, but there's more to the story. That 4 percent tax only applies to taxpayers who have an adjusted gross income of over $5 million. That could be individuals or small business owners who report their business income on their individual tax returns. In addition, it would not apply to that first $5 million. Only income in excess of $5 million would be taxed at an extra 4 percent. The surcharge ""is not targeted to small business. It's a wealthy person's tax,"" Williams told us. ""To the extent that those people are small business people, you can argue it's hitting small businessmen. But the bulk of small businesses are not at those income levels."" Robert McIntyre, director of the progressive group Citizens for Tax Justice, said only 34,251 of the 150 million tax returns filed in 2013 reported income of more than $5 million. That's about 0.02 percent. And because, in some industries, you are no longer considered a small business when you have more than 100 employees or more than $750,000 in revenue, it's not known how many of the people in that 0.02 percent would meet the definition of a small business. Finally, in August 2011 the Office of Tax Analysis at the U.S. Treasury Department estimated that only 0.5 percent of small businesses report a profit in excess of $1 million, another indication that the surcharge would only affect a tiny fraction of small businesses. The surcharge would not affect corporate tax returns. Our ruling Trump said Clinton's plan ""would tax many small businesses by almost 50 percent."" Clinton's proposal isn't directed at small businesses. Her surtax is intended to apply to rich individuals. The top tax rate (plus Medicare taxes) would go from the current 43.4 percent to 47.4 percent, but it would only be applied to amounts over $5 million. A mere 0.02 percent of tax returns fall into that category and some of those payers will not be small business owners. The statement has an element of truth but leaves out important details that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C218C0>],/factchecks/2016/aug/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-plan-would-tax-s/

Madigan targets Rauner's support for Trump campaign
","Governor Bruce Rauner has stayed decidedly quiet about the 2016 presidential campaign. Despite Rauner’s reluctance to comment, Democrats are pouncing on the opportunity to try to link the first-term governor to the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump. Illinois House Speaker and Democratic Party Chairman Michael Madigan is one of those Democrats. Madigan has compared Rauner to Trump several times and said he feels fully justified grouping the two together. In an interview with WSIU and WBBM radio stations published Aug. 1, Madigan said: ""Bruce Rauner is of record that he will fully support the Trump candidacy. It's documented. It’s available.""  We wondered if Madigan was right. Does Rauner fully support Trump? What’s Rauner’s take on the Republican presidential nominee? We looked into Madigan’s claim to find out. Supporting the presidential nominee  When we asked where Madigan found the information backing his claim, Madigan spokesman Steve Brown simply said, ""It’s everywhere online. Google it, and it will come up in 9 seconds.""
Brown didn’t point to any specific articles, so we took his recommendation and Googled our question. For the record, it only took Google .45 seconds to find articles relating to Rauner and Trump. In March, Rauner told reporters he would support the Republican presidential nominee, even if it turned out to be Trump. When asked why, Rauner explained, ""I’m the leader of the Republican party in Illinois."" He added, ""I will do everything I can to support that nominee."" That same month, he told students in Wilmette he was ""horrified"" by the presidential campaign rhetoric. ""Democracy is hard, you know, and this presidential election, oh my goodness, I'm appalled by the rhetoric, it's appalling,"" Rauner said. ""And it's ugly and it's nasty and it's weird, and just some of the statements that get made, I'm just, I'm horrified."" Since those public comments, Rauner’s been asked repeatedly about his actions related to the presidential election. Rauner hasn’t said much and doesn’t answer questions about Trump. On July 12, Rauner did not join Trump during a campaign fundraiser even though the two were both in Chicago that day. A week later, Rauner skipped the Republican National Convention in Cleveland when Trump formally became the party’s presidential nominee.    Rauner’s aides told the Chicago Tribune the governor wouldn’t formally endorse Trump, and did not explain why not. The Tribune reported, ""Rauner repeatedly had sought to stay out of the presidential race, though he did say that as leader of the GOP in Illinois, he would back the eventual nominee. But Rauner aides stressed there are various levels of ""support,"" and that the governor would not be giving Trump a formal endorsement."" Brian Gaines, a political science professor at the University of Illinois, said because Rauner isn’t up for election this year, there’s really no reason for him make any more comments about his relationship with Trump. ""There’s no law saying that a politician needs to endorse their party’s candidate,"" Gaines said. ""(Sen.) Mark Kirk is the more interesting example. Since he would have more interaction with the president and he’s up for election, he really needs to comment. Rauner’s interaction is somewhat fabricated."" In June, Kirk said publicly he would no longer support Trump. Gaines said Rauner’s language regarding Trump is much more nuanced and purposefully vague. ""(Rauner) could say voting for Trump is a form of support and he wouldn’t have to say another word,"" Gaines explained. ""And as the Trump campaign looks weaker and weaker, Rauner can point back and say ‘I never said I would endorse Trump.’""   Rauner continues to refuse to answer questions from reporters about the presidential election, and his office did not return multiple requests for comment from PolitiFact Illinois for this story.   Our ruling ""Bruce Rauner is of record that he will fully support the Trump candidacy. It's documented. It’s available.""  Madigan is correct. In March, Rauner said he would fully support the Republican presidential nominee. When asked by a reporter if he would still support the nominee if it’s Trump, Rauner reiterated his earlier statement, saying: ""I will support the Republican Party’s nominee."" But Madigan does not reference any of Rauner’s subsequent comments, including Rauner’s refusal to formally endorse Trump. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C082C0>],/factchecks/2016/aug/10/michael-madigan/Madigan-highlights-Rauners-support-Trump-camp/

Bill Clinton: Hillary tripled AIDS treatment without spending more
","When Bill Clinton wasn’t retelling how he courted his wife, he filled his Democratic convention speech, later published on Medium, with a long list of Hillary Clinton’s achievements in public life. When he got to her time as secretary of state, he applauded her work on HIV/AIDS. ""She tripled the number of people with AIDS in four countries whose lives are being saved with your tax dollars,"" Clinton said. ""Most of them in Africa, going from 1.7 million lives to 5.1 million lives, and it did not cost you any more money. She just bought available FDA-approved generic drugs."" We decided to take a closer look at those treatment gains and the price tag that came with them. Clinton’s statement is a bit unclear, first referencing a tripling in four countries, then giving the top-line treatment numbers that span many nations. We reached out to Clinton’s office for clarification. His staff told us that Clinton was talking about the overall HIV/AIDS treatment activities of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. We took his essential claim to be that thanks to his wife, treatment tripled and costs held steady. That’s not perfectly accurate, but it's close. PEPFAR started under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama kept it going. Hillary Clinton can take some credit for PEPFAR’s achievements because it is a State Department program. One of PEPFAR’s major goals is to get as many people as possible into treatment, primarily in Africa but on other continents, too. There is no cure for AIDS, still, antiretroviral drugs can slow down the HIV virus in the body, sometimes for many years. In 2013, the Government Accountability Office, the auditing arm of Congress, looked at how efficiently PEPFAR was getting those antiretrovirals to people in need. That report backed up Clinton’s statement, but it only covered the years between 2005 and 2011. Here’s why that’s important. Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state from 2009 through January 2013. For a full view of what PEPFAR did on her watch, we got the numbers through 2012. Drawing on the GAO report, PEPFAR’s own reports, and numbers we got from PEPFAR staff, we found these trends: The charts tell us that the number of people in treatment rose from 2.1 million at the end of 2008 to 5.1 million by the end of 2012 (fiscal years). That number more than doubled, but it didn’t quite triple as Clinton said. However, that increase did come without additional tax dollars. Using constant 2009 dollars, treatment spending fell dramatically for two years, and then returned to the 2009 level. When you put the two trends together, the big picture is that the United States used the same amount of money to deliver about 250 percent more treatment. Eric Goosby, the head of PEPFAR during those years and now professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, said the George W. Bush administration laid the groundwork for those gains. ""It takes a lot time to find the places to set up treatment, and get all the pieces in place to deliver it,"" Goosby told us. ""We benefited from all of that."" But Goosby also points to the rapid shift to generic drugs after 2009. ""We went from buying 90 percent brand name antiretroviral drugs to less than 3 percent,"" Goosby said. The generic drugs were much cheaper. The program also cut costs by cutting out air delivery and moving goods by land and sea. ""This saved millions of dollars and allowed for an uninterrupted expansion of the number of patients on treatment,"" he said. The chart above shows that on Hillary Clinton’s watch, the costs per patient were driven down by more than half — from $673 when she took control to $338 when she left. The question is, does she deserve the credit? Mead Over, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a Washington policy center, urges a bit of caution. Over told us that while a lot of the work is done by State Department agencies, not all of it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health and other agencies also play a role. But at the end of the day, Over told us the secretary of state sets the priorities and in this case, the priority was to expand treatment at a lower cost per person. There's evidence that Clinton wasn't just phoning it in. AIDS activists counted her as an ally. Mark Harrington, executive director of the Treatment Action Group, a New York-based advocacy organization, said he would give Clinton a lot of credit for what happened. Harrington said she built stronger reporting ties with PEPFAR than her predecesor and had a clear picture of what was needed. Harrington gave one example of how that led to her direct involvement. ""She helped clear the way for the switch from using expensive international NGOs to deliver services, to working with in-country partners and ministries of health,"" Harrington said. ""There was a concern about corruption, and she made it very clear to foreign leaders that that could not happen. And it’s really surprising for a program this big that it hasn’t."" Harrington also noted that Clinton was engaged with HIV/AIDS before she became secretary. When she was in the Senate, she met with activists and advocated for the programs and funds they sought. Our ruling Bill Clinton said when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, she tripled the number of people with AIDS whose ""lives are being saved,"" and it didn’t cost taxpayers any more money. Clinton took some liberties with the numbers. Treatment rose rapidly by about 250 percent. That’s not quite triple. But Clinton was right that those gains came without additional spending in inflation-adjusted dollars. And while Hillary Clinton can’t take full credit, outsiders said she did set the overall direction for how the program should move forward and intervened in specific ways to help it do more at a lower cost.

Clinton says undocumented immigrants pay $12 billion a year into Social Security
","Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton reiterated her support for immigration reform at a joint convention of black and Hispanic journalists Aug. 5. One of the event’s moderators, Telemundo national correspondent Lori Montenegro, asked Clinton how she would do it, since it has not been achieved during President Barack Obama’s time in office. Clinton said she would introduce legislation for comprehensive immigration reform in her first 100 days in office and would take a ""very hard look"" at deportation priorities. ""My priority are violent criminals, people suspected of any kind of connection to terrorism,"" she said, ""not hard-working mothers and fathers and people who go to work, help support this economy, pay $12 billion a year into Social Security."" We decided to take a look at her statement that undocumented immigrants pay $12 billion a year into Social Security. Clinton’s campaign referred us to a note issued by the Social Security Administration in April 2013 outlining the effects of unauthorized immigration on the Social Security Trust Funds. The report cited the $12 billion figure, but it also said the calculation is based on contributions from immigrants and their employers — that makes a difference for considering Clinton's statement. The two trust funds are the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), which pays retirement and survivors benefits, and the Disability Insurance (DI), used to pay disability benefits. The note from the Office of the Chief Actuary said its estimates are based on the best available information, but that it is difficult to determine with certainty what portion of total taxes paid and benefits received come from earnings of unauthorized immigrants. Still, the office estimated that in 2010, ""the excess of tax revenue paid to the Trust Funds over benefits paid from these funds based on earnings of unauthorized workers is about $12 billion."" Here’s how the administration came up with that number. Using Census estimates, SSA said about 12.6 million people were not permanent residents or citizens by January 2009. Nearly 11 million of them were undocumented, the rest had temporary status, such as student visas or temporary work visas. SSA adjusted that pool to exclude kids and other undocumented immigrants who would not be working. That left about 8.3 million ""other immigrants"" in 2010 who worked in the United States, including people who did not have legal permanent residency, who were not U.S. citizens and who had temporary legal visas. Of that 8.3 million people, SSA deducted the number of visa holders authorized to work (1.3 million) and an estimated number of those in the underground economy (3.9 million) who would not pay taxes. That leaves about 3.1 million unauthorized immigrants who worked and paid Social Security taxes in 2010 — about 600,000 of them at some point had work permits and overstayed terms of their visas, about 700,000 used fraudulent birth certificates to get a Social Security number, and about 1.8 million used a Social Security number that did not match their name. SSA estimated this group of unauthorized immigrants and their employers generated $13 billion in payroll taxes in 2010. (SSA estimates workers earned about $34,000, with a 6.2 percent tax rate for workers and employers.) Workers and employers contribute roughly the same amount into Social Security. The administration then subtracted about $1 billion in benefits that could’ve been received in 2010 from earnings in years when workers were unauthorized. SSA analysts said ""a relatively small portion"" of those who could draw benefits do so. Laws enacted in 1996 and 2004 block Social Security benefits paid to unauthorized immigrants or to any noncitizen without a work-authorized Social Security number at some point in time, the administration said. Unauthorized immigrants themselves cannot get Social Security benefits, but if they obtain legal status, there are limited ways through which they can collect benefits, said Tom Jawtez, vice president for immigration policy at the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund. We looked around and SSA’s 2013 note appears to be its latest available on the effects of unauthorized immigration on Social Security funds. In a 2014 Vice News piece, SSA’s chief actuary Stephen C. Goss affirms the $12 billion contribution. There are other estimates out there. Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pegs the annual amount of tax contributions by unauthorized immigrants at $7 billion. The Heritage calculation is based on a withholding rate of 6.2 percent of earnings, estimated earnings of $31,200, and 3.6 million unauthorized workers. The foundation appears to exclude employers’ payments on behalf of workers. Our ruling Clinton said that if elected president her administration would focus on deporting violent criminals, not ""hard-working mothers and fathers and people who go to work, help support this economy, pay $12 billion a year into Social Security."" The Social Security Administration estimates about $12 billion was paid into the administration’s trust funds from earnings of unauthorized workers in 2010 (after deducting about $1 billion from possible benefits paid out). This number includes contributions on behalf of employees as well as their employers. Workers and employers pony up about the same amount into the system. A calculation by another group excluded employer contributions and came up with a total of $7 billion paid into the system by undocumented immigrants. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate her statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f35b6a7f-9188-454b-a0f0-82e989f45642",[<zip object at 0x000002809C154A40>],/factchecks/2016/aug/10/hillary-clinton/undocumented-immigrants-social-security-contributi/

Ad blaming Cortez Masto for crime upticks as AG too narrow, misleads on blame
","Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto is taking fire from a new ad claiming crime increased in Nevada under her watch as attorney general. A new National Republican Senatorial Committee television ad (in both English and Spanish) blames the former state attorney general for increases in crime during her time in office. ""In Catherine Cortez Masto's last term as attorney general, Nevada murder went up 11 percent, robbery went up 28 percent, rape 51 percent,"" the ad says. ""When Cortez Masto left office, Nevada ranked as America's third most dangerous state."" The ad seeks to undercut part of Cortez Masto’s résumé that her Senate campaign relies on, invoking her tough-on-crime record in tv ads and referring to herself as the state’s former ""top law enforcement officer."" The numbers are technically accurate, but the ad fails to prove what Cortez Masto had to do with them. Crunching crime stats The claims about increased mayhem trace back to a 2014 report of state crime numbers over the last decade, which overlaps with Cortez Masto’s eight years in the Attorney General’s office. The ad correctly reflects the statewide percentage increases over Cortez Masto’s last term (2011 to 2014): Reported murders increased from 151 to 168 (11.2 percent) Reported robberies increased from 4635 to 5,951 (28.4 percent) Reported rapes increased from 895 to 1,351 (50.94 percent) Cortez Masto’s campaign said focusing on the back half of her tenure as attorney general was misleading, and that crime actually went down during her time in office. Total crime decreased from Cortez Masto’s first year in office (116,814) to her last (92,376), and most major reported crimes with the exception of rape decreased over that eight-year period. (A spreadsheet of the cited crime figure is here) Bill Sousa, director of UNLV’s Center for Crime and Justice Policy, cautioned that criminologists should take heed of any crime upticks. However, he said, year-to-year crime statistics can be unreliably ""volatile."" ""In terms of a couple of decades, a few years looking up isn’t evidence of a general trend,"" he said. The increase in reported rape is concerning, but there may be another explanation — the FBI broadened its definition of rape in 2012 (read more about the revision here). The bureau’s Uniform Crime Report saw subsequent increases in reported rape both nationally and in Nevada. Reported accounts of rape in Nevada have increased since the change in definitions, which was previously defined as ""carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will."" Plus, these figures only count the total crimes committed and aren’t adjusted for the roughly 300,000 population increase during Cortez Masto’s term. UNLV sociology professor Dr. Andrew Spivak said rates  of murder, robbery and the previous ""legacy"" definition of rape per 100,000 people decreased under Cortez Masto’s tenure in office. Generally, experts say, Nevada’s crime numbers likely trend higher because of the state’s heavy reliance on the tourism industry bringing large numbers of people, which isn’t reflected in the state’s population. ""If you could somehow control for tourism population, I’d expect that Nevada would drop on that list,"" Sousa said. NRSC spokesman Greg Blair said in an email that the ad focused on Cortez Masto’s second term to highlight her apparent political ambition outweighing other duties. That’s a serious charge, and there’s no concrete proof she had anything to do with the decline in crime in her first term or the subsequent increase in her second. Crime was at an historical low in 2011, and it’s hard to say why. The crime report itself cautions police agencies against drawing any conclusions about a specific department given the variety of factors that can affect crime trends. ""Because of other assigned duties, the peculiar cycle of crime and clearances, and different community factors that normally affect crime statistics, no conclusions regarding individual departments should be made without consulting directly with the agency being analyzed,"" the report states. Spivak was more blunt. ""I cannot even begin to imagine how states' attorneys general have much influence over crime rates,"" he said in an email. ""I suppose some might think that an AG who establishes a culture of harsh prosecution and various law enforcement initiatives will theoretically deter future crime ... but the kind of data to establish such a link is just impossible to generate."" Sousa said state-level crime policy is important, but changes in the raw numbers are more reliant on policing in individual neighborhoods and precincts. ""A lot of what we know about crime occurs at a local level,"" Sousa said. ""It points to the idea that what state-level policies do can have influence, can have an impact, but the impact is minimal."" Danger, danger (High voltage!) Similarly, there is some truth that Nevada took the third spot in a ranking of the 10 most dangerous states. Again, however, it’s not proven what Cortez Masto had to do with it, and the source is not as credible as the FBI. The NRSC cites a list published in January 2015 from 24/7 Wall Street, a website that covers financial news. The list indeed ranks Nevada third, but the data relies on both crime data and socioeconomic factors, such as the poverty rate and the percentage of adults with a high school diploma. No attorneys general, in Nevada or elsewhere, play much of a role in setting educational policy or promoting programs to get people out of poverty. Other rankings of dangerous states are somewhat of a mixed bag, mainly due to differing methodology. Another list by Law Street called Nevada the second most dangerous state, but that blog based the ranking on violent crimes per 100,000 people. Another ranking from WalletHub puts Nevada as ninth most dangerous of 51 states (including Washington, D.C.) but with a more involved methodology than other surveys. Spivak said reading into the rankings to determine which states were dangerous is ""utterly absurd,"" given variances in methodology and no standardization or weighted use of crime or socioeconomic indicators. Our ruling The NRSC ad says Nevada was ranked as the third most dangerous state by the time Cortez Masto left office, and that ""murder went up 11 percent, robbery went up 28 percent, rape 51 percent"" during her second term. The NRSC cherry-picks a handful of short-term crime statistics to portray Cortez Masto as weak on crime enforcement. But the argument is flawed. Experts agree that crime statistics are a crude way to measure safety, and Nevada has several quirks that inflate the numbers. The ad claims that Cortez Masto ""couldn’t keep us safe,"" but crime statistics have more to do with local law enforcement agencies than the state's attorney general. The NRSC offers no proven link connecting her actions as attorney general to a swing in murder, robbery and rape. The statement contains an element of truth but leaves out important details. We rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/20da9352-14b7-46e8-a972-54a48b43a59c",[<zip object at 0x000002809674B400>],/factchecks/2016/aug/10/national-republican-senatorial-committee/ad-blaming-cortez-masto-crime-upticks-ag-too-narro/

Libertarian Buckley on target about GOP's Isakson and federal debt
","Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Allen Buckley knows he faces an uphill battle in his campaign to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson. Libertarians usually pull only low single-digits of the overall Georgia voter turnout. And Isakson is a veteran lawmaker and a founding member of the state Republican establishment, which today holds sway over all statewide offices. Buckley ran unsuccessful campaigns for U.S. Senate in 2004 and 2008. But in 2008, he won  enough votes in the general election to force a runoff between Republican Saxby Chambliss and Democrat Jim Martin. An  Atlanta tax attorney, Buckley thinks he has an issue that will resonate with voters if he can only get them to  pay attention and understand the gravitas of the soaring federal debt. ""U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt!"" Buckley states on his website as part of a graphic about Isakson votes to raise the federal debt limit. Is that possible? Has Isakson, who has pushed for a balanced budget amendment and who also blasts the federal debt on his campaign website,  actually assisted the spending spree? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. Buckley and Democrat Jim Barksdale will face Isakson in the November election. We first contacted Buckley, who said the graphic refers to Isakson’s repeated votes to raise the federal debt limit, which essentially means raising the cap on what the government is permitted to spend to pay the bills. ""I believe Mr. Isakson has, irresponsibly and immorally, voted to grow the federal government through debt spending to the detriment of young people and our country."" Buckley said in an email. He later added: ""He largely created the mess and then voted to fund what he created."" Buckley said Isakson voted for debt-bloating items like the war in Iraq and the Medicare prescription drug benefit and subsequently voted for debt-ceiling increases to cover the cost of the increased spending. Isakson’s campaign manager, Trey Kilpatrick, dismissed Buckley assertions, but did not dispute Isakson’s vote to raise the debt limit. ""Mr. Buckley is trying to mislead voters by citing debt ceiling votes (required for solvency) without citing Johnny's votes against trillions of dollars in unnecessary spending, including voting against a minimum of $5 trillion in debt ceiling votes alone, or his vote for the Budget Control Act, which cut spending by over $2 trillion and, according to the Heritage Foundation, 'has shrunk the size of government more effectively than any budget tool in a generation,"" Kilpatrick wrote in an email. The debate over the federal debt comes at an interesting time. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office earlier this month  released a report that warned of vastly increased federal debt when compared to the Gross Domestic Product over the next three decades.  Federal debt held by the public was 39 percent of GDP in 2008, but is now about 75 percent, the budget office said. That could rise to 86 percent by 2026 and a whopping 141 percent by 2046. ""The prospect of such large debt poses substantial risks for the nation and presents policymakers with significant challenges,"" the budget office warned. The CBO said the government’s spending growth is outpacing revenues as spending soars for popular programs like Social Security and  Medicare and interest on the government’s existing debt. The most popular programs cost a lot to maintain,  and neither Democrats nor Republicans want to be blamed for cuts, experts told PolitiFact. PolitiFact consulted political and budget experts across the county. Their verdict: Buckley has a point about Isakson’s spending votes, but there is a lot of context missing. University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said many of the most popular federal programs are also the most expensive. That puts politicians of all stripes in a difficult spot. ""Some, like Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, Defense spending, interest on the debt etc. are bigger than others,"" Sabato said.  ""Given that many of these categories are mandatory, it’s hard to imagine that any member of Congress hasn’t cast votes that effectively increase the amount of debt the country incurs."" Chris Edwards, an economist with the Cato Institute, said that by voting for debt-limit increases members of Congress have ""kicked the can down the road"" on the government’s debt problem. ""Voting for annual deficit-financed budgets causes the accumulated debt to rise, but voting to increase the legal debt limit—as Isakson and others do regularly—ratifies the unsound practice of endlessly spending more than is taken in,"" Edwards wrote in an email. 
Kennesaw State University political scientist Kerwin Swint said voting  to raise the debt ceiling is not quite the same thing as voting to create new programs or authorize new spending items ""The alternative to not raising the debt ceiling is shutting down the government,"" Swint said. Buckley’s claim is ""technically accurate of course but totally misleading,"" saidAlan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. Abramowitz said the U.S. should  take advantage of extremely low interest rates to borrow more money to invest in much needed infrastructure improvements and other projects. ""It cannot be emphasized enough that the debt obsession of some conservative politicians and pundits is totally misplaced at a time when the investing community is practically begging to purchase U.S. treasury notes at extremely low interest rates,"" Abramowitz said.   Our ruling:    Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Allen Buckley proclaimed on his campaign website: ""U.S. Sen.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Wisconsin', 'David Canon']","
Professor: House Speaker Paul Ryan has only proposed three bills that became law in his career.
","Even after endorsing Donald Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan continues to wrestle with the divide between him and his party’s presidential nominee. ""We’re different people,"" Ryan, who is from Janesville, told reporters at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. ""There are different kinds of conservatives."" While Trump appeals to emotions, Ryan tends to be cast as the GOP’s policy wonk. But in a July 9, 2016 New York Times article, the chairman of the University of Wisconsin’s political science department suggested Ryan’s reputation may be overblown. Why? Few of his plans ever become law. ""(Ryan) has actually proposed three — total, three — bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999,"" David Canon was quoted as saying. ""Paul Ryan is not a detail kind of legislator in terms of putting bills together to pass, and he never has been. ""He is an ideas guy."" When Ryan announced his endorsement of Trump, he wrote that the first step in setting policy agenda is ""putting it on paper and having a real debate."" In making his claim, Canon suggested Ryan doesn’t follow his own advice — or hasn’t had much success with it. Let’s take a look. Bills, bills, bills The article listed three bills proposed by Ryan that became law: ""One named a post office in Wisconsin, a second changed taxes on arrows used by deer hunters, and the third, this year, established a $3 million presidential commission on ‘evidence-based policy making.’ "" A visit to Ryan’s profile at Congress.gov shows — when filtered by ""Sponsored Legislation"" and ""Became Law"" — the same three bills referenced in the article. While Canon was quoted as saying Ryan proposed only three bills, he told us he was referring to bills ""sponsored"" by Ryan. ""Sponsoring a bill is very different than co-sponsoring a bill,"" Canon wrote in an email. ""Many bills that become law have a hundred or more cosponsors, so bill sponsorship is the meaningful indicator of the member of Congress who had primary influence on determining the content of a bill."" According to Congress.gov, Ryan has sponsored 109 pieces of legislation and co-sponsored 1,067. Of those, 83 became law. New York Times reporter Jackie Calmes said it was clear from their conversation that Canon was referencing sponsored bills, and the statement’s context in the article reflects that. But Ryan’s camp challenged how Canon assessed Ryan’s tenure. ""Any realistic look at (Ryan’s) record will clearly show the claim that Paul has only passed three bills is objectively wrong,"" said spokesman Ian Martorana. He references three particular items not included in the count, all of which Ryan helped write: Murray-Ryan Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 Trade Promotion Authority legislation in 2015 Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, in which Ryan authored disability insurance reforms For four years, Ryan also chaired the House Budget Committee, which wrote and passed a nonbinding resolution each year, Martorana said. Jennifer Victor, a professor of political science at George Mason University and an expert on Congress, said while Ryan has only personally sponsored three bills that became law, bill passage is not necessarily a good indicator of effectiveness as a legislator. ""Some legislators may be very active in a policy area, but rarely see enactment,"" she wrote in an email. ""Think of someone who introduces many bills, perhaps symbolically, and they all die in committee or get voted down on the floor."" While this legislator hasn’t changed the law, he or she might have generated attention for a topic. Measuring impact based only on the bills a lawmaker solely sponsors also introduces issues, Victor said. Early cosponsors can be heavily involved in the bill’s content and committee chairs, while they don’t necessarily write more bills, often serve as facilitators. A better indicator of effectiveness, Victor said, is a tool developed by two professors that measures a lawmaker relative to his or her peers. It takes into account the content of a lawmaker’s bills and how far the bills moved. Policy bills, for example, increase a lawmaker’s score more than commemorative bills. But it only looks at solely sponsored bills, which does not necessarily give the full picture of a lawmaker’s impact. By this tool, Ryan comes off as more effective, though his effectiveness is below the benchmark expectation for all but one two-year period since 1999. The expectation is calculated based on his party, tenure and specific committee and subcommittee positions he has held. Our rating Canon told the New York Times that Ryan ""has actually proposed three — total, three — bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999."" Canon was referring to bills Ryan solely sponsored and is on target by that measure. But the claim suggests Ryan has been an unproductive lawmaker. Another tool out there provides a better view, but — like Canon — ignores legislation Ryan helped author but didn’t solely sponsor. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970AE740>],/factchecks/2016/aug/10/david-canon/professor-house-speaker-paul-ryan-has-only-propose/

Common Cause video says half of all NC legislative races are uncontested due to gerrymandering
","Gerrymandering: It’s something most people learned about in grade school but didn’t think much about until recently, when a deluge of court cases challenged the extent to which politicians can pick their constituents instead of the other way around. And now Common Cause, an advocacy group that opposes gerrymandering, says the process is robbing voters of power by creating districts so inclined toward one party or the other that politicians will never face a real challenge. ""What if an election was decided before a single vote is cast?"" an online Common Cause ad asks, over ominous music. ""It’s happening in North Carolina right now. Half of all NC legislative candidates are unopposed because of gerrymandering. Gerrymandering deprives voters of a voice and a choice in our elections. Help us end gerrymandering now."" That seemed pretty stunning to us. North Carolina is a swing state in presidential elections, with Barack Obama barely winning here in 2008 and then barely losing in 2012. So are we really supposed to believe that half of all the candidates for the North Carolina General Assembly are running unopposed? We wanted to check not only if that was true, but also if gerrymandering is to blame – or if there’s some other culprit. What is gerrymandering?  The practice is named after Elbridge Gerry, a 19th century Massachusetts governor who signed a law redrawing political districts for political gain. A local newspaper said one district looked like a twisting salamander, and ever since then ‘gerrymander’ has stuck. North Carolina has long been literally a textbook example of gerrymandering. The Washington Post analyzed all 435 U.S. House of Representatives districts in 2014 and said North Carolina tied Maryland for the title of most gerrymandered state in the country. ""Overall, the North Carolina GOP's efforts paid off handsomely,"" the Washington Post analysis said. ""Based on their statewide vote share you'd expect North Carolina Democrats to hold about seven seats. But they won only four."" A federal court recently forced North Carolina to redraw its U.S. House districts since two were too reliant on race. But it’s not just at the federal level in North Carolina that election districts have been overturned. Even local county and school boards have had their redrawn district lines thrown out. Gerrymandering is a bipartisan issue. The districts overturned recently were drawn by Republicans, but North Carolina Democrats also used gerrymandering when they held power. Uncontested races But while courts have ruled on districts at the local and federal levels, the district lines for the N.C. House and N.C. Senate are intact so far. And it’s those districts that the Common Cause video is focused on. Since the districts are all roughly the same size in terms of population, the group is basically saying that half of North Carolinians don’t have a choice whether a Republican or Democrat will represent them in the state legislature. So we crunched the numbers. In the N.C. House, 55 of the 120 seats will be uncontested in November. That’s not half, but it’s very close. In the N.C. Senate, though, the number is lower. Of the 50 Senate races, only 15 have just one candidate. That’s about 30 percent. In total, of the 170 state legislative seats, 70 of them (or 41 percent) were decided in the primaries or even before: Of the Senate’s 15 uncontested candidates, 13 also had no primary opponent. Of the 55 uncontested House candidates, 40 had no primary opponent. Bob Phillips, the executive director of Common Cause’s North Carolina chapter, acknowledged the number was slightly under half. He said there are also a number of races that are contested by candidates who lose by double digits. But we’ll recognize those quixotic efforts and give the candidates credit – they did, after all, at least run a campaign. So while Common Cause missed the mark on the number of uncontested races, it wasn’t too far off. But what about the second part of the claim, that gerrymandering is to blame? A mix of issues There’s no way we could interview the people who decided not to run against these 70 uncontested candidates because, well, we don’t know who they are. But from talking to some political experts and reading academic and legal papers, we found agreement that gerrymandering is to blame for some uncompetitive races. It’s not the only reason. Name recognition or a strong fundraising operation could be why some people aren’t challenged, said UNC-Charlotte political science professor Martha Kropf, a past president of the North Carolina Political Science Association. She said that’s especially true ""if you’re looking at someone who’s been in office for a while."" That’s arguably the case for people like N.C. House Speaker Tim Moore and N.C. Senate leader Phil Berger – the two most powerful legislators in the state – who both faced no opponent in either the primary or general elections, despite the sometimes controversial nature of legislation they’ve backed. And even someone with ties to Common Cause, Ted Arrington, said it’s not accurate to blame every single vacancy on gerrymandering – although it can certainly have an effect. Arrington is an expert witness on voting rights who has testified in several dozen court cases in the U.S. and Canada. ""If all the districts were 50-50 chance of winning by party (registration), there would still be cases where the party failed to find a candidate or the incumbent is just so well-liked no one is going to run against him,"" said Arrington, a retired political science professor. Arrington is also a former vice chairman of the Mecklenburg County GOP, in which role he helped Republicans win power in the Charlotte area. He said both parties sometimes don’t run candidates for races they think they’ll lose no matter what, since doing so could encourage the other side to turn out in greater numbers – which could affect more competitive races elsewhere in the county or the state. But that strategy alone can’t explain why half the General Assembly races have only one candidate. Arrington said in a ""perfect"" system he wouldn’t be surprised if one in every five races was uncontested, ""but it shouldn’t be half. Not in a presidential election year."" Our ruling Common Cause claimed that half of all races for the state legislature will be uncontested this year because of gerrymandering. It’s actually a bit less than half, but not too far off. And experts agree that while gerrymandering isn’t wholly to blame, it does contribute significantly to the high number of uncontested races. We rate this claim Mostly True. The premise is accurate, although it’s slightly exaggerated.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280971CAD80>],/factchecks/2016/aug/09/common-cause/common-cause-video-says-half-all-nc-legislative-ra/

Debbie Wasserman Schultz misleads in attack on Rick Scott about mosquito funding
","U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz pointed blame at Republicans -- namely Gov. Rick Scott -- for not doing more to dish out dollars to prevent the spread of the Zika virus. ""While he seems to be saying out loud that he wants Congress and the president to provide more funding, he conveniently leaves out that he cut nearly $1 million dollars from mosquito control and closed down the state’s mosquito research lab a few years ago,"" Wasserman Schultz said at a town hall in Broward County on Aug. 8. Wasserman Schultz is running for re-election in the Aug. 30 Democratic primary against first-time candidate Tim Canova. Did Scott cut funding and close the state’s mosquito research lab? There’s a lot more nuance to this story than Wasserman Schultz lets on. Mosquito control budget The current Zika pandemic took off in May 2015, when Brazil reported cases in connection with more babies being born with abnormally small heads, a condition called microcephaly. When Wasserman Schultz spoke, there had been a total of 422 Zika cases in South Florida, the majority acquired while traveling and 16 locally acquired. Wasserman Schultz told reporters that she was referring to Scott’s budget decisions in 2011. Her spokesman pointed to an article in Politico that explained cuts to state aid to local mosquito control programs. That was Scott’s first budget year after he ran on a platform to slash spending amid the recession. State budget records show that while Florida under Scott cut money to mosquito control his first two years, the state later raised it substantially: 2010-11: $2.2 million (Gov. Charlie Crist's last budget) 2011-12: $1.3 million (Scott’s first budget) 2012-13: $1 million 2013-14: $2.7 million 2014-15: $2.8 million 2015-16: $2.7 million 2016-17: $2.8 million Jackie Schutz, a spokeswoman for Scott, said that he has invested more than $13.2 million in funding for mosquito prevention and control. Separately, ""Gov. Scott has allocated more than $26 million to combat Zika and will continue to allocate more if necessary,"" she said. Mosquito lab Wasserman Schultz’s claim about the closed lab relates to the Florida A&M University Public Health Entomology Research and Education Center in Panama City Beach. In 2011, Scott vetoed a one-time $500,000 appropriation for the center intended to keep it open after it had faced threats of closure. The center, first opened in 1964, was referred to as the ""mosquito lab"" or PHEREC, and came up with ways to combat mosquitoes. It was once a part of a state department, but in the 1990s it became part of Florida A&M while still receiving state health department dollars and other grants. In 2010 as Florida A&M was cutting millions of dollars from the university amid state cuts, it announced that PHEREC was on the chopping block. Provost Cynthia Hughes Harris said at the time that the university decided to eliminate non-teaching units such as the mosquito lab. In a last-ditch attempt to save the lab, researchers sought a one-time appropriation from the 2011 Legislature for $500,000 late in the budget process. Florida TaxWatch labeled it a ""turkey,"" and Scott vetoed it as part of his $615 million in vetoes as the state was climbing out of the recession. The lab still had $1.4 million -- enough to keep it open -- but the university chose to shutter it anyway, wrote Dr. John Smith, the center’s former director, in a Florida Mosquito Control Association newsletter. ""In fact, there were sufficient reserve funds to continue PHEREC for as much as two or three years without the legislative appropriation,"" Smith wrote. ""Why FAMU did not allow this remains unclear."" Walter J. Tabachnick, at the time director of the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory at the University of Florida’s site near Vero Beach, warned about the loss of dollars in a blog after the cuts. ""How can one quantify the loss of future opportunities to make progress and improvements in Florida mosquito control?"" he wrote. ""There will be future problems for which we will not have solutions, there will be lost opportunities to make mosquito control more effective, efficient, and environmentally proper."" However, Tabachnick who remains a professor at UF, told PolitiFact Florida that the decision to close the lab wasn’t by Scott. ""The decision to close PHEREC, to withdraw all funding, was made by Florida A&M, not the governor,"" he said. Meanwhile, the state has funded research at a different university center. The Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory at UF has received $500,000 annually from the state since 2013-14. That money is for research to develop and test formulations, application techniques, and procedures of pesticides and biological control agents to control mosquitoes that can cause public health or a nuisance. Speaking to reporters after her town hall, Wasserman Schultz pointed the finger at Scott for the spread of Zika. ""He bears some responsibility in this problem that we are facing now since we are not as fully prepared as we could be if those cuts had not come down,"" she said. But Tabachnick says it’s not so simple. ""There are no promises in investment in research,"" he said. ""I don’t know what information we may have had or not. It’s like saying if we had more money in cancer, we would find a cure. I can’t say that."" Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that Scott ""cut nearly $1 million dollars from mosquito control and closed down the state’s mosquito research lab a few years ago."" In 2011, the Legislature under Scott did cut about $1 million for mosquito control dropping the total to about $1.3 million and cut it again by about $300,000 the following year. But the state then increased the budget to about $2.7 million the next year and it has remained in that ballpark for four years. Scott also vetoed a one-time appropriation of $500,000 in 2011 for a mosquito lab at FAMU, and the university then shut it down. But the center was already on the university’s chopping block, and the state has since funded another university’s lab.

Mike Pence claims national debt has nearly doubled under President Obama
","Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, reiterated many of his campaign partner’s promises at a recent town hall in Phoenix. From building a wall along the Southern border to fixing the economy, Pence also attacked Democrats, saying Hillary Clinton in the White House would equal a third term for President Barack Obama. And that wouldn’t be a good thing, he said. ""Under this administration, the debt has nearly doubled,"" Pence said Aug. 2. Obama took office in January 2009 while America continued to reel from the recession. We fact-checked a similar statement in April 2015. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., claimed the debt doubled under George W. Bush and is tripling under President Obama. We rated it Half True -- the debt under Obama has tripled since Bush took office, but other factors affect debt.  But, we wondered, as Obama’s presidency comes to a close, where are we now in terms of debt? Important context Pence spokesman Marc Lotter pointed us to the Treasury Department’s Debt to the Penny clock, a real-time look at the nation’s debt that goes back almost two decades. On Jan. 20, 2009, when Obama took office, the gross federal debt (which includes both public and intragovernmental debt) was $10.63 trillion. As of Aug. 3, 2016, it is $19.4 trillion. So the numbers check out. But experts we spoke with still note that the debt cannot be pinned on just Obama. For one thing, Congress signs off on spending and taxation. And, reining in government spending during the recession would have been a bad idea, economists told us. George Washington University law professor Neil Buchanan noted that the economy was in ""free-fall"" when Obama took office. In Arizona, the housing market crashed and key sector jobs, such as construction, dried up. ""Tax revenues were plummeting, because incomes were falling, while spending had to go up (for unemployment benefits, Medicaid, and so on),"" Buchanan said. ""Had we tried to balance the budget during that time, it would have accelerated the downturn, and there could have been a depression.""  Moreover, according to Bucknell University economics professor Gregory Krohn, the Congressional Budget Office projected in January that debt held by the public would increase to 75.6 percent - up from 39.3 percent in 2008. ""Debt held by the public, a more meaningful measure, more than doubled from $6.4 trillion to $13.9 trillion over the same period,"" Krohn said. Our ruling Pence said that under the Obama administration, ""the debt has nearly doubled."" His numbers are on the mark. But it is important to note that the debt cannot all be blamed on Obama. Congress has a role in approving spending. And, experts told us that money needed to be spent in a free-falling economy. We rate Pence’s claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/74377f97-8d5a-4dd0-b0c1-12c13563759c",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B179C0>],/factchecks/2016/aug/09/mike-pence/mike-pence-claims-national-debt-has-nearly-doubled/

Donald Trump exaggerates Michigan job losses from coal regulations
","During an economic address at the Detroit Economic Club, Donald Trump tailored some of his statistics to the local audience. ""As a result of recent Obama EPA actions, coal-fired plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions, making them non-competitive in many cases,"" Trump said. ""The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs."" Trump has often criticized efforts by the Obama administration -- and those who find climate change to be a serious concern -- to wean the United States from fossil fuels by tightening federal environmental regulation of coal-fired power plants. Here, we’ll take a look at the second part of Trump’s statement: ""The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs."" This assertion initially caught our eye because we’d never thought of Michigan as one of the premier coal-producing states. Our suspicion was correct: According to the National Mining Association, Michigan is not on the list of 26 states that currently produce any amount of coal. Meanwhile, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of workers engaged in any type of mining in Michigan over the last decade has varied between 5,000 and 7,000, making it essentially impossible to have lost 50,000 existing jobs in that sector. And as the Washington Examiner has noted, Michigan has fewer than 20,000 people working in the electricity generation sector today. So the scale of the job losses Trump cites seem, at least at first blush, to be unlikely. So what was Trump trying to say? The prepared version of his speech includes a footnote that points to a news release from the National Mining Association published almost five years ago, on Sept. 7, 2011. Here are some excerpts from that news release, which criticized ""Beyond Coal,"" a campaign against coal-fired power plants coordinated by the environmental group the Sierra Club and cited a study the group released: ""The destructive impact of the ‘Beyond Coal’ campaign is most clearly evident in the following 10 states where power plants blocked by the club represent the highest number of potential jobs (construction and permanent) foregone: Illinois (126,612), Texas (122,065), Montana (114,102), Nevada (75,194), Florida (75,055), Ohio (70,371), Colorado (55,620), Michigan (53,587), Oklahoma (42,581) and Kentucky (38,824)."" In response to an inquiry from PolitiFact, Andrew Wheeler, an energy adviser to the Trump campaign, also pointed to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce analysis that found that 10 delayed or canceled projects in Michigan -- most of them coal-fired plants -- would have created 56,000 jobs up front had they been built. Between the 53,000 jobs cited by the National Mining Association and the 56,000 jobs cited by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Wheeler said, ""it is obvious that the ‘over 50,000 jobs’ cited by Mr. Trump is accurate."" But just because a campaign is able to footnote a specific number doesn’t mean that the number is meaningful, or as fully contextualized as it ought to be. Here are a few important things to know about this number. • The number refers to ""potential"" jobs lost, not actual jobs lost. This is an important point that would not be obvious from the way Trump phrased his statement. By leaving the impression that these were actual jobs lost, Trump’s statistic invites a degree of outrage that isn’t warranted. And there are good reasons to be cautious about future job projections, especially when they have been framed so broadly as to include vendors to the industry, rail transport, ports and machinery manufacturers. Any job projections of this sort are subject to rosy estimates -- especially if a group has a vested interest in the issue. In making an argument to the public, all groups will put forward their most favorable case. Trey Pollard, the national press secretary for the Sierra Club -- which has its own dog in the fight -- said the number of plants being counted by the mining association are essentially ""the coal industry’s wildest dreams"" -- a reflection of circumstances in which they can build coal plants ""in any community they want to."" • The number doesn’t reflect that coal is increasingly being replaced by natural gas. Trump’s decision to use this number tells only part of the story of how the electricity sector has been developing. In recent years, according to federal statistics, coal has been losing ground to natural gas and, to a lesser extent, renewable energy when it comes to electricity generation. A July 2016 analysis by Sam Evans of the School of Business and Economics at King University in Bristol, Tenn., found that environmental regulation has been a factor in this switch, but a ""secondary"" one. ""The recent decline in the generation share of coal, and the concurrent rise in the share of natural gas, was mainly a market-driven response to lower natural gas prices that have made natural gas generation more economically attractive,"" Evans wrote. • This isn’t just about Obama or Clinton. Trump ignores that much of the impetus in Michigan for switching away from coal has come from the state’s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, and from utilities themselves. Snyder has generally continued his support for steps to shift away from coal that began under his Democratic predecessor as governor, Jennifer Granholm. In 2015, Snyder said at an energy conference that ""now is the time to look at a long-term transition away from coal,"" adding that because of the state’s natural gas infrastructure, ""we're well positioned to actually have a fair amount of that coal demand go to natural gas."" And Gerry Anderson, the chairman and CEO of DTE Energy, an electric utility that serves more than 2 million customers in the state, has written that ""we plan to retire older, less efficient coal plants and build new, cleaner natural gas power plants over the next decade."" Our ruling Trump said that ""the Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs."" However, this claim is problematic on several levels. While the number matches one projection of how many potential jobs could be lost from the blockage of coal-fired plants, there’s a difference between actual jobs lost and potential future jobs lost. And the number cited -- an impossible-to-confirm projection based on broadly construed calculations released by a pro-coal group -- should be taken with a big grain of salt. Trump also ignores that market forces, not just environmental regulations, have driven many of the job losses in the coal sector, and he also ignores that Michigan Republican officials and utilities themselves -- not just the Obama administration -- have pushed the switch away from coal. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809782F2C0>],/factchecks/2016/aug/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-exaggerates-michigan-job-losses-coal-/
"['Colorado', 'Negative Campaigning', 'Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee']","
DCCC ad says Mike Coffman said he would ""support' Trump, but he's condemned GOP nominee
","Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman made international headlines with an ad sharply criticizing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump — a first for a House GOP lawmaker. ""People ask me, 'What do you think about Trump?’ Honestly, I don't care for him much,"" Coffman said in the online ad released Aug. 4, 2016. ""So, if Donald Trump is president, I'll stand up to him, plain and simple. And if Hillary wins, I'll hold her accountable every step of the way."" Coffman, who is fighting for re-election in a suburban Denver district that is one of the state’s most competitive and ethnically diverse, spoke Spanish in one version of his anti-Trump ad. Democratic groups, and some political reporters, were skeptical about whether Coffman’s stand was courageous or politically calculated. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee quickly issued a counter ad. It shows Coffman vowing, ""So if Donald Trump is the president, I’ll stand up to him."" Then a narrator says, ""Wait, you’re the one who said you’d support him. Don’t let Mike Coffman get away with this gimmick."" It ends with side-by-side photos of Coffman and Trump and the text: ""SAY NO to Mike Coffman AND Donald Trump."" It’s been a constant battle this election season as Democrats seek to shackle Republican candidates to their party’s controversial presidential candidate. The DCCC ad cites a six-month-old statement that Coffman’s spokeswoman gave to the Colorado Statesman as evidence Coffman would ""support"" Trump. But the statement, from Kristin Strohm, also clearly said Coffman supported former GOP presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, whom Coffman endorsed in late 2015. ""Will Mike Coffman support the Republican nominee over Bernie or Hillary?"" Strohm said in the Feb. 2 story. ""The answer is obviously yes. And he believes strongly it is going to be Marco Rubio."" At the time, Trump was one of 11 Republicans still in the race. The DCCC attack echoes a May claim by an immigration reform group that cited the Colorado Statesman quote along with criticism of Coffman’s record on immigration as evidence that the congressman was ""with Trump."" PolitiFact rated that claim Mostly False. At the time, Coffman political director JD Key suggested to PolitiFact that Coffman might be having second thoughts about automatically supporting the GOP nominee. ""Rep. Coffman has not endorsed or voiced support for Donald Trump,"" Key said. In fact, Coffman has said for three months — before and after the billionaire became the GOP nominee — that Trump hasn’t earned his support. ""Both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have tapped into a legitimate anger about the failures of Washington, but instead of running a campaign built on a positive vision for overcoming these failures, Donald Trump has conducted a polarizing and divisive campaign,"" Coffman said in a May 4 statement. ""Hillary Clinton is a non-starter and lacks the integrity to lead this nation but Trump has a long way to go to earn the support of many — me included."" Coffman’s problem with Trump flared when Trump falsely blasted the Colorado GOP’s caucus system as ""rigged,"" after Ted Cruz won all 34 delegates on April 9. Coffman, a Marine Corps combat veteran, fired back with this April 18 Facebook post: ""If there is anyone who knows what a rigged system looks like it’s Donald Trump who was able to evade the draft during the height of the Vietnam War when the U.S. was losing, on average, 1,000 troops every month. That system was clearly rigged in favor of young men from politically influential families but Donald Trump never complained about that."" Coffman also went after Trump in June when Trump aggressively defended his claims that a judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University is biased because of his Mexican heritage in an interview on CNN. Coffman tweeted June 3: ""Donald Trump has said plenty of outrageous, ridiculous things this year. And still, I literally can’t believe the words that came out of his mouth here. Donald Trump should call Jake Tapper, sit in front of a camera that’s recording, and retract this completely and totally unAmerican slur."" Coffman didn’t attend the Republican National Convention in Ohio. Following Trump’s acceptance speech, Coffman told the Denver Post it hadn’t changed his view of the GOP nominee, saying ""I don’t like him much."" Then came Trump’s hostile response to the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq. The soldier’s father had criticized Trump’s proposal to ban Muslim immigration, saying the Republican nominee had ""sacrificed nothing and no one,"" during a speech at the Democratic National Convention. Coffman told the New York Times that Trump had disrespected American troops. ""Having served in Iraq, I’m deeply offended when Donald Trump fails to honor the sacrifices of all of our brave soldiers who were lost in that war,""  Coffman said. Soon afterward, Coffman released his anti-Trump ad. Again, Coffman told PolitiFact’s partner Denver7, ""Donald Trump has not earned my support,"" on the day the ad aired. ""What does it take for Donald Trump to get your vote?"" Denver7 reporter Marshall Zelinger asked. ""He has not earned my vote,"" Coffman said. ""I'm going to wait and watch, but the window's closing. (Trump's) wrong on policy, wrong on rhetoric. I think Hillary Clinton is wrong on everything. I think she's so incredibly dishonest and corrupt, but again, Donald Trump has not earned my vote."" Coffman said he would not rule out voting for the Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and vice presidential nominee Bill Weld. Yet, when KUSA asked Coffman, ""Would you rule out supporting Donald Trump for president?"" he said, ""No."" The fence-straddling reply drew a website headline: ""Coffman (kind of) comes out against Trump."" The DCCC defends the accuracy of its ad claim — ""you’re the one who said you’d support (Trump) — based on the February statement by Coffman’s spokeswoman that he would ""obviously"" support the eventual GOP nominee. It doesn’t matter how many times Coffman says ""Trump has not earned my support,"" DCCC says, arguing that his position hasn’t changed if he leaves the door open to backing him. ""He's trying to have it both ways,"" the DCCC said. Our ruling The DCCC said of Coffman, ""You’re the one who said you’d support (Trump),"" in response to Coffman’s ad saying he would stand up to Trump. The DCCC’s evidence is based on a six-month-old statement during the primary by his campaign spokeswoman. The spokeswoman said Coffman would ""support the Republican nominee,"" stressing Coffman wanted Rubio out of the remaining 11 candidates. Since then, Coffman has become the only Republican House lawmaker to issue an ad criticizing his party’s presidential nominee. He has condemned Trump’s treatment of a Gold Star family and demanded that he retract his ""totally unAmerican slur"" of a Mexican-American judge. Most importantly, Coffman himself has repeatedly said the billionaire has a long way to go to earn his support. The DCCC ad skirts key facts. Coffman has never embraced Trump’s candidacy —  even saying ""I don’t like him much"" — and he’s gone farther than most Republicans in rebuking his ""polarizing and divisive campaign.""

Viral image about Florida voter fraud baseless
","As Donald Trump muses about a ""rigged"" system that could cost him the presidential election, a debunked post detailing rampant voter fraud in 2012 is making a comeback. The image, which provides a list of seven examples of voter fraud in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, has been posted on several news outlets and forums (including Right Wing News, USA Carry and Conservative Stronghold) and has been shared thousands of times. The image was also shared in January 2013 on email, according to Snopes and FactCheck.org.  For this fact-check we’ll look at the claims about St. Lucie and Palm Beach counties in Florida. Spoiler: Both are wrong. One statistic represents a misunderstanding of how votes are cast in Florida, and another is completely made up. St. Lucie County The post says, ""In St. Lucie County, FL, there were 175,574 registered voters but 247,713 votes were cast."" This allegation confuses votes with cards. St. Lucie County had a ballot with two pages, meaning voters who completed both pages cast two cards. According to St. Lucie County’s 2012 general election results, the number of cards cast in the 2012 general election was 247,383. Gertrude Walker, the county’s supervisor of elections, told us whoever made the image overlooked a disclaimer on the website at the time that explained how a two-page ballot differs from a vote. (It isn’t there anymore, but we can confirm it using the Wayback Machine.) The disclaimer said: ""Turnout percentages will show over 100% due to a two-page ballot. The tabulation system (GEMS) provides voter turnout as equal to the total cards cast in the election divided by the number of registered voters. Also note that some voters chose not to return by mail the second card containing the amendments."" The same page where the person took the number of cards cast also contains the number of votes cast. It shows that 123,301 votes were cast in the presidential election out of 175,554 registered voters. So the voter turnout for the presidential election was about 70 percent. Palm Beach County The post moves farther down the state to Palm Beach County, where there was a ""141% voter turnout"" in 2012. This claim is baseless, and there is no support for the 141 percent. County data for the 2012 general election shows there were 605,268 votes cast out of 870,182 registered voters. So, Palm Beach County had almost 70 percent voter turnout. Our ruling The post makes two claims about voting in Florida counties during the 2012 presidential election. Both are wrong. The figures cited about St. Lucie County mix up the number of votes cast with the number of cards cast. The Palm Beach County claim uses an erroneous percentage, with no real source. The post’s digs at Florida rate Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8d8e1cc4-149a-4c31-956c-c0d2654ef1d7",[<zip object at 0x0000028096728C00>],/factchecks/2016/aug/09/viral-image/viral-image-about-voter-fraud-completely-baseless/

Building a Better Ohio says public workers make 43 percent more in wages and benefits than private sector workers
","
Ohio's debate over Issue 2, the referendum on Senate Bill 5, has drawn particular attention to the compensation of public employees.

Voters will decide the fate of the issue Nov. 8. Voting ""yes"" on Issue 2 is voting in favor of SB 5, which restricts the collective bargaining rights of all public workers in the state. A ""no"" vote on Issue 2 is a vote to repeal SB 5.

Issue 2 supporters say that SB 5 would help control costs for public employers at the state and local levels. The argument is distilled in ""Had Enough,"" a 30-second TV spot from the political action group Building a Better Ohio.

""Without Issue 2,"" the voice-over narration says, ""hard-working Ohio families will face higher taxes to pay for the excessive wages and benefits of government employees, who already make 43 percent more than the rest of us.""

Reinforcing the point, words on the screen say, ""Government employees make 43 percent more in wages and benefits.""

The assertion that Ohioans will face higher taxes is speculative. PolitiFact Ohio can't rate it because it involves predicting the future.

But PolitiFact Ohio was interested in the assertion that the compensation of public employees is 43 percent higher -- almost half again as much -- than the compensation of workers in the private sector.

We asked Building a Better Ohio for the basis of its claim. Press secretary Connie Wehrkamp referred us to a recent study that the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy group,prepared for the Ohio Business Roundtable.

The study found that public workers, based on wages alone, earn about 2.5 percent less than comparable private employees. But it concluded that public workers make 43 percent more when the value of benefits, including pensions and ""job security,"" are factored in.

AEI authors Andrew Biggs and Jason Richwine said that wages were ""comparable,"" that pensions and health insurance helped give public workers a 31.2 percent edge in non-wage benefits. The most significant factor came in the way they calculated pension funding for public and private sector workers, putting a premium on the ""guaranteed"" element of public pensions. We will return to that.

Job security, they said, adds an economic value of about 10 percent -- meaning that job security makes a $40,000-a-year job, for example, worth $44,000 to the employee. But that’s not the same as the public employer giving the employee $4,000 more in a paycheck.

But that wasn't the last or first word.

The study came in response to a paper by Rutgers University professor Jeffrey Keefe that was published by the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Keefe's study said that Ohio public employees annually earn 6 percent less on average than comparable private-sector employees in total compensation (wages and non-wage benefits).

Keefe followed it in October with another paper rebutting the study from AEI.

In our reading of the studies, the biggest disagreements came in the areas of health benefits for retirees (which not all public employees receive), pension costs and job security.

We sought guidance on those matters -- or a referee -- from the authoritative and nonpartisan Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Because of its interest in pension plans, the center published a research paper in September that examined other papers and compared public and private compensation.

The center found no real disagreement among researchers that state and local workers as a group ""are paid less than their private sector counterparts.

""The question,"" it continued, ""is the extent to which the value of the benefits provided to state-local workers offsets the wage penalty.""

It determined the answer was not as great as what the AEI paper asserts.

Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research, told us that the largest points of contention with the AEI study came over pension funding and job security.

The primary issue with pension funding was disagreement about the ""discount rate,"" which is the interest rate used in figuring how much money must be set aside today to make future payments.

The estimates of those costs in the AEI study  push up the figure for public employers far higher than what the Center for Retirement Research found. Conversely, AEI’s study projected smaller Social Security costs for private employers.

Several economists told us that the discount rate is a hotly contentious issue in the field, largely because the ""correct"" rate can't be proven empirically.

Munnell noted that the center put no added value on job security, because the historical advantage in the public sector has diminished or disappeared. When it has existed, she said, job security was taken into account as the trade off for lower wages in public employment. Making it a separate factor would be double counting.

""We concluded,"" Munnell said, ""that public sector compensation in Ohio is 9 percent higher than private sector compensation.""

What does PolitiFact Ohio conclude?

The claim does contain an element of truth. The non-partisan Center for Retirement Research would agree with the notion that benefit packages on average can increase the value of a public employee’s compensation package above that of the average private sector worker.

But there are critical facts that give a different impression of Building a Better Ohio’s claim.

There is general agreement that public employee wages, on average, are less. The AEI study Building a Better Ohio relies on estimates they are about 2.5 less than comparable private employees.

The ad from Building a Better Ohio flatly states that public employees ""make 43 percent more"" than private sector workers. We think the average listener would interpret that as meaning the average public employee is paid - in wages and benefits - 43 percent more. But some components of the AEI study aren’t based on money changing hands, but rather on the value to the employee of certain benefits.

Even leaving out the considerable disagreements over the calculation of pension costs, the inclusion of job security as a monetized figure in compensation is questionable. The AEI study says that security has a value of 10 percent of the pay. But that doesn’t translate to more money paid to the employee.

Whether it exists or not, job security is an intangible factor, like job satisfaction, that can't be spent, saved or taxed. It doesn’t put more dollars and cents into employee compensation.
We think it is misleading to include it in an accounting of what workers ""make.""

Also, the AEI study arrived at its 43 percent figure through rounding that we could not follow, and which the Center for Retirement Research questioned, after adding the 10 percent for job security to the 31.2 percent advantage in non-wage benefits it says that public workers have a 43 percent edge over their private sector counterparts.

And that 31.2 percent advantage -- whose calculation is the subject of considerable disagreement in the pension and financial worlds -- is more than three times the finding of the Center for Retirement Research.

Obama says health law will kick in for millions next year
","
In a television interview with the Tampa Fox affiliate, President Barack Obama discussed last year’s sweeping health care legislation, a centerpiece of his re-election campaign and a favorite point of attack by his challengers.

The law is designed to provide health insurance to nearly every American by creating insurance exchanges for people to purchase plans and expanding Medicaid for the poor. It includes an individual mandate requiring people to buy coverage in order to spread risk and costs across the population. That provision in particular is the subject of numerous court challenges and is the least popular aspect of the law.

Interviewer Mark Wilson pointed to that fact in the Nov. 1, 2011, interview, noting ""54 percent of Americans favor repealing some version some part of that law. As you know, Florida leads the way in repealing it. What would you do differently now with regards to health care reform, knowing what we know now?""

Obama responded by touting some of the law’s benefits.

""Well, look, keep in mind a million young people around the country have health care that didn't have it before because they can stay on their parents’ health care plan. Millions of families all across the country benefited from additional drug benefits as a consequence of that health care plan,"" the president said. ""Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get health care next year because of that law.""

The ""next year"" part of that struck us as suspect, so we decided to check it out.

The law and its many provisions are designed to take effect in steps over a period of years. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a timeline posted on its website explaining the phase-in.

The changes set to take effect in 2012 mainly involve payments to Medicare.

The individual mandate, along with Medicaid expansion and establishment of the insurance exchanges, doesn't kick in until 2014. Those are the provisions of the law expected to give millions of Americans access to health insurance, and thus health care.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that next year only about 1 million more Americans will gain health insurance. The figure balloons to 19 million in 2014, and 30 million in 2016 when those concrete changes are fully implemented.

Parts of the law already up and running -- which have chipped away at the number of uninsured Americans -- include policies for people with pre-existing conditions and an allowance for young adults to remain on their parents’ health plans up to age 26.

We asked the White House what Obama’s ""next year"" claim was based on but did not hear back.

In addition, as we’ve noted before, the individual mandate faces a significant battle in the courts and is likely to end up being decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. If it is ruled unconstitutional, the CBO projects that 16 million fewer people will become insured. Other studies put that reduction at between 8 million and 24 million.

Our ruling

Obama said ""Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get healthcare next year because of that law.""

The CBO, a nonpartisan source, predicts only 1 million people will benefit in 2012, with the significant increases coming in 2014 and 2016. Plus, the law’s future is uncertain.

The president is understandably enthusiastic about seeing his signature legislation take effect. But he misstated the timing of how many people will gain health insurance and when. It’s not happening next year. We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972084C0>],/factchecks/2011/nov/03/barack-obama/obama-says-health-law-will-kick-millions-next-year/
"['National', 'Military', 'New Hampshire 2012', 'Joe Biden']","
Biden calls Libya a job well done
","
Speaking Oct. 21, 2011 in Plymouth, New Hampshire, Vice President Joe Biden did not confirm the death of former Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi, even as rumors of his death were flying. But the vice president was happy to credit the Obama administration with a job well done.

""In this case, America spent $2 billion total and didn’t lose a single life,"" Biden told an audience at Plymouth State University. 
""This is more the prescription for how we deal with the world going forward than we have in the past,"" he said, arguing that the cost of the operation in Libya was low, both in lives and dollars, compared to other military operations. 
Biden is right about the fatalities. Few American soldiers set foot in Libya during the seven-month campaign, led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and certainly no fatalities were reported, according to Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Elizabeth Robbins.

But is he correct about the $2 billion figure? We decided to take a look.

Reached for comment, Biden’s office conceded that the vice president’s numbers were on the high side, saying that he wanted to leave room for spending that might not be accounted for.

Instead, the VP’s office deferred to the Department of Defense, which reports that total spending for the Libya intervention reached $1.1 billion through September 30, 2011.

The Pentagon’s estimate covers the costs of daily military operations, munitions used, humanitarian assistance and the draw-down of supplies, according to Robbins, the department spokeswoman. But that figure likely doesn't include diplomatic and intelligence operations, among other costs absorbed by the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and other federal agencies, according to military analysts and academics.

In most military engagements, the U.S. State Department absorbs some costs, including jet fuel for travel to meetings, among other diplomatic efforts, according to John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, an online security information database. ""Any place that you are aware of that has uniformed military personnel, there were State Department personnel involved in getting them into it,"" Pike said.

Further, the CIA. regularly conducts classified intelligence missions that are often not included in Pentagon estimates, Pike said.

These costs, among others associated with military efforts, are nearly impossible to track. Neither the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Accountability Office nor the White House Office of Management and Budget monitor these numbers, according agency media relations representatives. And the North Atlantic Treaty Organization does not differentiate costs by country, according to a NATO spokesman.

Even if there are many peripheral costs, however, they pale in comparison to the Defense Department totals, according to analysts.

The operational costs of war are typically so high -- $330 billion so far in Afghanistan and $708 billion in Iraq, according to Pentagon estimates -- that diplomatic, intelligence and other supplementary costs barely make a drop in the budget, according to Todd Harrison, senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a public policy research institute in Washington, D.C.

""There could be additional costs to the operation outside the DoD budget. … However, these costs are likely to be small relative to the military costs of the operation,"" Harrison wrote in an email. ""I suspect they would only add a few percent to the total cost.""

Our ruling:

Biden’s numbers were high to leave room for unaccounted costs, as his office acknowledges. The vice president’s $2 billion figure is nearly double the $1.1 billion reported by the Pentagon and largely supported by military analysts. But, those same analysts note that there are other costs related to military actions that often are not reported.

Nevertheless, even the higher number supports Biden’s deeper point. The military intervention in Libya -- in addition to not resulting in a single American military fatality -- cost the country less than 1 percent what the Pentagon has spent in Iraq and Afghanistan. We rate Biden’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809721B100>],/factchecks/2011/nov/03/joe-biden/biden-calls-libya-job-well-done/

Ag chief Adam Putnam says Florida's giant snail 'carries human meningitis'
","
Florida is now home to a slime-oozing plant-chowing snail the size of a teacup Chihuahua, and Adam Putnam wants to make sure that's temporary.

The giant African land snail can grow up to 8 inches, live nearly a decade, devour indiscriminately, lay 500 eggs at a time and snack on stucco for the calcium to build its shiny brown shell striped with cream.

It's a backyard horror and an agricultural nightmare. 
Putnam, the state's agriculture commissioner, also says it carries disease.

The 1,000-snail invasion of a South Florida neighborhood became news in mid September. It's the biggest outbreak reported since the 1960s, when the state spent $1 million over the course of a decade battling three smuggled-in snails of a Miami boy that became 18,000.

Last weekend, CBS News Sunday Morning featured the snails along with other invasive species, from Illinois' Asian carp (fish) to Georgia's kudzu (plant). Southwest Miami homeowners described the ""disgusting,"" ""slithery,"" ""juicy"" pests. Putnam explained the public threat.

""With something like the snails we've got the trifecta,"" Putnam said. ""It carries human meningitis, so people are concerned. It eats 500 different plants, so agriculture's concerned. And it eats houses, so homeowners are very concerned.""

Leaf- and stucco-chomping? Check. Just ask the snails' Miami neighbors. But disease-carrying? PolitiFact Florida decided to check it out.

About that disease: Your brain and spinal column are protected by membranes called meninges. When they get inflamed, that's meningitis. Often there's a bacteria or virus that causes the swelling, but you might also hit your head, get cancer or take certain drugs and end up with the illness. Or get a fungus. Or a parasite.

Around the world, giant African land snails are known for carrying a parasite, one that spends part of its life in rats, that can cause a rare form of meningitis. (Most people fully recover without treatment.) It's known as the rat lungworm, or Angiostrongylus cantonensis. Snails — and prawns and crabs and frogs — pick up baby rat lungworms from rat droppings. Other animals who chow down on tasty raw crab or frog legs or snail guts pick up the larvae and can end up with the brain infection. Animals can also get it from eating unwashed snail-slimed greens, or from rubbing snail mucus into their eyes or noses or mouths.

That group includes humans.

Who eats giant snails? Plenty of folks, if not so many in the United States. Just consider escargot, the tasty French preparation of smaller, corn-fed snails doused in butter, garlic and herbs. Their meatier big brothers are an important protein source in coastal Nigeria. You can order them in a New York restaurant for $10. But it's not cooked snails that are the problem — for the same reason most folks don't eat raw shrimp or raw meat in general, for that matter. You heat them first, to kill uninvited disease-causing guests. It's the undercooked or raw ones that can be a problem. And also other exposure to slime.

Take two cases of meningitis in Louisiana: In one, an 11-year-old boy had eaten a small raw snail on a dare. In another, a 22-year-old had eaten two raw legs from a green tree frog — also on a dare.

(Note to America's youth: Don't do dares!)

Then there is Florida's infamous case of giant snail slime exposure last year, where an African holy man poured the stuff into mouths of followers hoping for healing. Instead, they got violently ill — though not of meningitis.

In England, giant African land snails are novelty pets that live in terrariums and sometimes crawl on their owners.

Where's the meningitis worry? 
Snails that don't have a chance to pick up baby rat lungworms can't give them to you. Pet snails that haven't lived in the wild don't carry the parasite, which require rats to complete their life cycle. No parasite-incubating rats, no rat lungworms. No snail-caused meningitis.

The parasite is found in snails in the South Pacific, Asia, Australia and the Caribbean. It shows up in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, with sightings in Louisiana and Mississippi.

Florida had its rat lungworm scare in 2003, when a gibbon at Miami Metrozoo suddenly fell ill. It could have been a sign the rat lungworm had made it into the state's rats, snails, frogs and shrimp. Or it could have simply been infected monkey food from overseas. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services dispatched a biologist, John Teem, to test snails around the zoo, said spokesman Sterling Ivey. He never found rat lungworm. 
He's tested some of the state's apple snails — an invasive species   — and hasn't found rat lungworm. 
This year, when the Southwest Miami neighbors started to notice their garden snails seemed larger and more prolific than normal, Teem tested those, too. Even in the giant African land snails, he didn't find rat lungworm.

The state health department doesn't track meningitis caused by the parasite. Neither do the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's exceedingly rare in the United States. Even in Hawaii, where the parasite's common, just five such cases in one year prompted academic study.

On Sunday, TV-watchers saw Putnam, the state's agricultural authority, warn them on national television about the snail's triple threat: house-eating, plant-devouring and disease-carrying. He didn't mention the disease hasn't been found in the state — and where it's been found in America, it's exceedingly rare. Or that to get it, you've got to eat a raw snail or get its mucus in your eyes or nose or eat unwashed snail-slimed produce.

Frequently, information sources point out that the giant African land snail can carry a meningitis-causing parasite. Putnam said, ""We've got the trifecta,"" and said the snail ""carries human meningitis."" He leaves out some crucial details — most importantly, that the parasite that causes the disease hasn't yet been found in the state. And for that, we rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C4D580>],/factchecks/2011/nov/03/adam-putnam/florida-ag-chief-adam-putnam-says-floridas-giant-s/
"['National', 'Iraq', 'Barack Obama']","
Ad says Obama is reason for Iraq pullout
","
It’s not exactly like George W. Bush’s ""mission accomplished"" moment, but President Barack Obama is declaring victory of sorts.

A campaign ad touting four of Obama’s accomplishments as president includes this assertion: ""Because of Barack Obama the mission in Iraq ended.""

Given the boldness of the statement, we decided to look further.

Ending the mission

The day Obama took office in January 2009, he summoned Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and top military leaders to the White House, held a closed-door meeting and then issued this statement:

""During the discussion, I asked the military leadership to engage in additional planning necessary to execute a responsible military drawdown from Iraq.""

It marked the fulfillment of a campaign promise Obama made to end the war, directing military leaders to begin withdrawal.

About 18 months later, he declared that the American combat mission in Iraq was ending. When we asked the Obama campaign to provide the basis for the ad, they cited this announcement.

""Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country,"" Obama said in a televised Oval Office address on Aug. 31, 2010. ""This was my pledge to the American people as a candidate for this office.""

PolitiFact gave Obama another Promise Kept for that milestone.

Obama said 50,000 troops would remain in Iraq, focusing on ""supporting and training Iraqi forces, partnering with Iraqis in counterterrorism missions, and protecting our civilian and military efforts."" He said those remaining forces would leave by the end of 2011.

Which brings us to his announcement in October 2011 that all U.S. troops would depart Iraq before Christmas.

""Today, I can report that, as promised, the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year,"" Obama said at the White House. ""Our troops will definitely be home for the holidays.""

A small force of a few hundred Marines will remain to help train Iraqi forces, as well as a large diplomatic contingent.

The war pre-Obama

Despite the goals Obama met, most of the timetable for leaving Iraq was in place before he took office.

The prevailing document, the 2008 Status of Forces Agreement, was negotiated between the Bush administration and the Iraqi prime minister Nuri al-Maliki. That’s what set the deadline of Dec. 31, 2011, for all U.S. troops to leave Iraq.

""He essentially implemented the plan that he inherited,"" said Chris Preble of the libertarian Cato Institute.

James Carafano, of the conservative Heritage Foundation, compared Obama taking credit to saying ""because of Truman we were victorious in World War II, without mentioning Roosevelt.""

Even when the deadline was set, news reports say, it was considered somewhat soft -- more a political symbol establishing Iraq’s sovereignty than a concrete date. The Obama administration held to that line and planned to keep several thousand troops in Iraq beyond 2011 as a ""residual force.""

Administration officials negotiated with Iraqis all year to amend the withdrawal plan. The breakdown: immunity for American troops in Iraqi courts. The Iraqi parliament refused to approve it, and American officials wouldn’t leave U.S. forces in place without it.

""When the Americans asked for immunity, the Iraqi side answered that it was not possible,"" al-Maliki said in an October news conference. ""The discussions over the number of trainers and the place of training stopped. Now that the issue of immunity was decided and that no immunity to be given, the withdrawal has started.""

But Obama didn’t spin the withdrawal that way. He portrayed it as another fulfillment of a campaign promise.

Michael O’Hanlon, with the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, has written favorably about Obama’s policies in Iraq. But he said the planned troop pullout is no victory.

""He did a good job of making the transition to where we are now gradual and careful. He took credit for that in his August 31, 2010, speech and he deserved to,"" O’Hanlon said. ""But what’s happened these last couple weeks has been regrettable. Not primarily Obama’s fault. But not a success and not something to take credit for at this moment.""

Said Carafano: ""It’s absolutely a face-saving thing.""

Politically though, Obama may be making a wise calculation.

""My speculation would be that they’ve concluded that the public will support the pullout,"" said Preble. ""The polling on this is just overwhelming. There are very, very few Americans who want U.S. forces to remain in Iraq.""

""It’s not a great campaign speech to say, ‘negotiations failed so we’re taking credit for pulling out,’"" he added. ""It appears that they’re trying to put a positive spin on what others have attempted to cast as a setback or a failure. It’s only a failure if you think we should keep troops in Iraq.""

A real withdrawal?

What remains in Iraq are thousands of federal contractors, diplomats and a huge American embassy in Baghdad.

And don’t forget the tens of thousands of American military stationed just over the border of Iraq in places like Turkey and Kuwait.

Said Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Oct. 26, 2011: ""We will maintain a long-term relationship with Iraq. And we will have, as you know, a long-term presence in that area. We've got over 40,000 troops in that region, just 23,000 alone in Kuwait. So we are going to be there.""

""I suppose you could make an argument that we’re just going back to the status quo,"" said Carafano, referring to the time before the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

We should note that the Obama campaign said the ad we were checking had a word missing -- that ""the mission in Iraq"" should say ""the combat mission in Iraq."" They revised the ad and sent it to us: 


Our ruling

The Obama campaign ad (the original one) said ""Because of Barack Obama the mission in Iraq ended.""

It’s true that the president held steadfast to his promises of ordering military leaders to end the war, halting combat operations and finally bringing the remaining troops home.

But those benchmarks were put in place by a previous president. Obama, when he took office, could have steered the operation in a different direction, amping up the military force in Iraq or pledging a long-term presence there. But he adhered to the blueprint, including trying to extend the withdrawal deadline. Only when that failed because of the immunity question did Obama announce -- and take credit for -- the full withdrawal. It was a savvy political move maybe, but not a totally forthright statement. Also, the U.S. mission in Iraq will be continued to a large extent by contractors and diplomats. Therefore, we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C4D380>],/factchecks/2011/nov/03/barack-obama/ad-says-obama-reason-iraq-pullout/
"['Virginia', 'Corey Stewart']","
Corey Stewart endorsement of George Allen is Full Flop
","
Some of the sharpest criticism of George Allen’s bid to regain his old seat in the U.S. Senate has come from Corey Stewart, a fellow Republican who is chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors.

""George Allen would be a terrible candidate for the Republican party in 2012,"" Stewart said in a TV interview on Jan. 24, 2011, the day Allen announced his candidacy. ""He's got the baggage, he ran a poor campaign in 2006, and he never acted as a conservative when he was in the U.S. Senate.""

At the time, Stewart was considering running against Allen for Virginia’s 2012 Republican senate nomination. He lauded Allen as a ""great governor"" from 1994 to 1998. But Stewart said Allen’s term in the Senate, from 2001 to 2007, was ""mediocre.""

""He did nothing to control the expansion and the growth of the federal government during his tenure in the Senate,""Stewart said. He faulted Allen -- who lost his reelection bid in 2006 to Democrat Jim Webb --  for supporting budgets that increased debt and backing the expansion of Medicare.

""George Allen is part of the problem, not the solution,"" Stewart said in an article that ran in The Washington Times on Dec. 28, 2010.

In several interviews, Stewart even expressed revulsion Allen’s often-stated reverence for Thomas Jefferson’s views on limited government. ""Frankly, it makes by stomach turn a bit because Thomas Jefferson would not have voted to expand the scope of the federal government,"" he said in the Jan. 24 TV interview.

""Jefferson would be rolling over in his grave if he heard Allen quote him,"" Stewart said in a Jan. 25 article in The Washington Post.

Let’s fast forward to Nov. 1, 2011, when Stewart, appeared at a news conference with Allen. ""I hereby endorse and give my full support to George Allen for the United States Senate in 2012,"" he said.

Stewart was asked about his characterization of Allen as a ""mediocre"" senator. ""All in all, I’ve got to say that I retract that statement and I have to say he had a very good senate record,"" he said.

What explains the change? Stewart, in a phone interview, said his negative comments about Allen earlier this year were fueled by his own interest in running for the Senate in 2012 -- an ambition he has since dropped.

""Obviously, that colored my view,"" he said. ""I’m an ambitious fellow, I’ll be frank about that, and at that point I was only seeing the bad (in Allen).""

Although Stewart said he still does not agree with some of the votes Allen cast during his first term, he is convinced that Allen would compile a more conservative record if he is elected to the Senate again.

""The country has changed,"" he said. ""There’s been a huge wake-up signal sent by the Tea Party that they no longer want a wishy-washy Republican Party. They want a party that pares back the role of government and spending. George gets that.""

Stewart also said Allen offers the best hope in next year’s Senate race for defeating former Gov. Tim Kaine, the presumptive Democratic nominee.

Stewart’s endorsement of Allen is not a difficult case for on our Flip-O-Meter. Anytime a politician totally recants an earlier position, as Stewart has done, we rate it a Full Flop.

Potential recall candidate says Walker gave companies two years of no taxes
","
A trailblazing African-American union leader has captured the imagination of liberals as a potential challenger to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, should the Republican governor be forced into a recall election in 2012.

Mahlon Mitchell, a Madison Fire Department lieutenant who has never run for political office, has emerged as a possible Democratic candidate. In late October 2011, a movement to draft him surfaced on the Internet and Mitchell said he would consider running against Walker.

In January 2011, Mitchell, then 33, became the youngest person and the first African-American elected president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin union. Mitchell was soon sought out by the national media as a critic of Walker’s collective bargaining changes, which prompted weeks of demonstrations in Madison but exempted Mitchell's members. He has been giving speeches at union rallies and other events around the country.

On Oct. 4, 2011, Mitchell repeated his criticisms of Walker at a Washington, D.C., conference called Take Back the American Dream, which was described in one news report as an attempt to ""re-energize disenchanted liberals.""

""Let me tell you what the governor did in January"" before introducing the bill that stripped collective bargaining rights from most public employees, Mitchell said. 
""Any business that comes into the state of Wisconsin from Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota -- two years you don't have to pay any taxes on your income.""  

Much has happened since Walker made his first legislative moves shortly after taking office in January -- the demonstrations, recall elections of state senators and preparations for the expected launch on Nov. 15, 2011, of the effort to recall Walker.

So, did the governor really grant companies that move to Wisconsin two years of tax freedom?

Mitchell cited Assembly Bill 3, one of the measures introduced in a special legislative session called by Walker in January. It allows a business that moves to Wisconsin to claim a tax deduction for two consecutive years, according to a memo from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council, which provides legal and other research services to the Legislature.

A memo from Walker’s budget office makes it clear the deduction is equal to the amount of income taxes owed. It is not known, of course, how many companies will take advantage of the deduction, but the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimated that without such a law, the state would collect $500,000 more per year in taxes.

Walker promoted the measure as one way to create more jobs in Wisconsin.

The bill was approved 82-12 by the Assembly and 24-9 by the Senate, with a total of 29 Democrats voting yes. It was signed into law by Walker on Jan. 31, 2011.

Our conclusion

Mitchell said that because of actions taken by Walker, businesses moving to Wisconsin ""don't have to pay any (income) taxes"" for two years. Walker backed and signed a law that offers such a tax deduction. We rate Mitchell’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097675440>],/factchecks/2011/nov/03/mahlon-mitchell/potential-recall-candidate-says-walker-gave-compan/

Robert Menendez says New Jersey budget shortfall means education funding cuts
","
After more than 20 years of public service on the local, state and federal levels, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez should know you can’t adopt a state budget that doesn’t pay for itself.

But that’s what Menendez, a Democrat, suggested during an Oct. 18 press conference about the Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act, which he recently introduced. The legislation is aimed at creating or protecting jobs for teachers, police officers and firefighters.

""New Jersey alone, my home state, is facing a ten-and-a-half billion dollar shortfall in its 2012 fiscal budget,"" Menendez said. ""This means more cuts in state and local spending for education, which means our kids are hurt.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that although New Jersey is not meeting all of its statutory obligations, the fiscal year 2012 budget adopted in June is, as required by state law, a balanced spending plan with no shortfall.

As for education spending, the budget actually increases state aid for public schools over the previous fiscal year.

Tricia Enright, a spokeswoman for Menendez, acknowledged the senator was wrong to suggest there is a current budget shortfall.

""So, yes, he used the wrong tense in expressing the need to invest in educators for our kids,"" Enright wrote in an email. ""But, the need is there and the facts – as our Senator, and most Americans see them -- are clear.""

But let’s explain the history behind the $10.5 billion cited by Menendez.

In July 2010, the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services estimated a ""structural deficit"" of nearly $10.5 billion for fiscal year 2012. That figure represented the difference between projected revenues from existing sources and the amount needed to pay for all spending required by state law and maintain current program levels.

However, there’s a difference between what the state is legally obligated to spend and what is budgeted.

The fiscal year 2012 budget does not entirely cover the spending level used to calculate the projected structural deficit, but the budget itself is balanced between its anticipated revenues and expenditures.

In other words, there is no shortfall.

It would be ""unconstitutional"" to adopt a budget with a built-in shortfall, and OLS is not projecting a shortfall to occur during fiscal year 2012, according to David Rosen, the budget and finance officer for the OLS.

""A budget shortfall during a fiscal year is a different animal than a structural deficit looking forward to a budget,"" Rosen told us. ""Those are two different concepts, really.""

Elizabeth McNichol, a senior fellow at the Washington, DC-based, Democratic-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said a state can have a structural deficit as well as a balanced budget. Once a budget is balanced, that year’s budget shortfall has been addressed, she said.

McNichol added, ""Every year, a state will end up balancing its budget, one way or another.""

It’s worth pointing out that Gov. Chris Christie has since rejected the use of the structural deficit, calling for a zero-based budgeting approach. In a Sept. 30 email, Andrew Pratt, a state Treasury Department spokesman, told us: ""Except in theoretical terms, that means there are no longer any deficits to discuss.""

Now, let’s talk about education spending under the fiscal year 2012 budget.

Menendez suggested that the budget means ""more cuts in state and local spending for education."" But as we’ve noted in previous rulings, the budget increases state aid for public schools by about $863 million over fiscal year 2011.

The state is not funding public schools at the total level required by law, but funding is still up year-over-year, Rosen said.

Our ruling

Menendez claimed New Jersey ""is facing a ten-and-a-half billion dollar shortfall in its 2012 fiscal budget,"" meaning more cuts in state spending on education.

Although a nearly $10.5 billion structural deficit had been projected, the fiscal year 2012 budget is balanced, as required by state law. Also, the budget increases state aid for education over the previous fiscal year.

Since Menendez is wrong about there being a budget shortfall and education funding cuts, we rate this statement False.

Group says proposed constitutional amendment costs state taxpayers nothing
","
An email blast advocating for a proposed constitutional amendment on the Nov. 8, 2011, Texas ballot says Proposition 2 will help ""build critical local water supply projects that create jobs and protect us from drought and wildfire.""

The email from Texans 4 Prop 2, funded by the H2O4TEXAS political action committee, goes on: ""This does not cost state taxpayers any money. Yes, that’s right, Prop 2 advances critical, job-creating local water projects at no cost to state taxpayers.""

Residents of communities benefiting from the requested $6 billion boost in bonding authority would pay such debt costs.

We wondered if state taxpayers would be scot-free.

The proposition, among 10 changes to the constitution placed before voters by state lawmakers, would authorize the Texas Water Development Board to issue additional general obligation bonds on a continuing basis for one or more accounts of the Texas Water Development Fund II, according to an explanatory statement from the state.

According to a July 2011 House Research Organization background paper on the proposition, the bonds are ""self-supporting.They require no draw on (state) general revenue,"" meaning revenue ponied up from state taxpayers, ""but use the state’s superior credit rating to finance water and wastewater projects for public entities — including cities, districts, and nonprofit water supply corporations — at a lower interest rate than the entities could receive with other financing."" To date, non-self-supporting bonds approved by lawmakers have required state revenue to cover a portion of the interest on the bonds.

After asking the pro-proposition group for backup information, we interviewed Melanie Callahan, the board’s interim executive administrator, who said the reason there’s no state cost for such self-supporting bonds is that debt on the bonds is repaid by the benefiting entities. To date, she said, no jurisdictions have defaulted on such payments.

Case closed?

Not quite, we realized.

Two analyses of the proposal -- a fiscal note written by the Legislative Budget Board when lawmakers were acting last spring and a description of the ballot proposal by the Texas Legislative Council, which helps legislators draft proposals -- state that Proposition 2 allows legislators to appropriate money to pay debt service on the bonds. If so, we surmised, any such appropriation would pose a cost to state taxpayers.

Generally, the fiscal note says, the proposed amendment has no ""significant fiscal implication to the state... other than the cost of publication"" on the ballot, $105,495.

However, the note says, the proposal ""includes bond authority that would comprise a mixture of self-supporting debt and non-self-supporting debt,"" meaning debt not covered by the benefiting jurisdictions repaying the state. ""Any non-self-supporting debt that receives a General Revenue appropriation for debt service,"" the note says, ""would impact the state's constitutional debt limit,"" meaning it would be a cost to the state and its taxpayers.

The note continues by saying the water-development board can only issue such non-self-supporting debt with legislative authorization.

The council’s analysis includes similar language.

In interviews, a board staff spokesman, John Barton, and the council’s chief legislative counsel, Jeff Archer, each said the reference to legislators subsidizing debt payments reflects the established constitutional authority of Texas legislatures to appropriate money.

Archer said the ballot proposition might pose ""little to no risk to the state revenue. That doesn’t mean there’s no risk,"" meaning a future Legislature could supplement related debt payments by tapping state revenue.

We checked back with the water development board. General Counsel Ken Petersen said that under the constitution, lawmakers have full power to manage the board’s financing activities by changing state law and appropriating state revenue for any purpose, including debt payments.

Proposition 2 alone ""does not cost state taxpayer money at all,"" Petersen said. ""What could cost (taxpayer) money is what the people who get elected to the Legislature (in the future) choose to do... That is a choice the Legislature makes.""

Callahan told us lawmakers have done so before in situations when debt payments by benefiting communities would not flow quickly enough to the state to satisfy terms.

More than $1.7 billion in board-overseen general-obligation bonds outstanding as of Aug. 31, 2011 consisted of $1.2 billion in self-supporting bonds, with debt not paid by state taxpayers, and nearly $528 million in non-self-supporting bonds for which legislators voted to pick up a portion of debt service, at a cost to state taxpayers, she said by email. 
Most recently, Callahan said, the water board got legislative permission this spring to convert $24.5 million in self-supporting bonds for the San Antonio Water System to build a brackish water desalination project into non-self-supporting bonds, with a portion of interest on the bonds consequently being paid from state revenue. 
""The Legislature's direction to issue non-self-supporting debt has been more prevalent in the last few years in order to help fund state water plan projects, in the absence of a dedicated funding source"" for such projects, Callahan said.

Of about $512 million in debt service paid by the water development board from 2008 through August 2011, about $101 million, or 20 percent, came from legislative appropriations, Callahan said, with benefiting jurisdictions covering the rest.

The treasurer of the H2O4TEXAS PAC, Heather Harward, agreed that future Legislatures could spend general revenue to cover the debt service on the non-self-supporting bonds envisioned in the ballot proposal. ""But as of today, based on the will of the (2011) Legislature and the direction provided to lawmakers by Texans, the bonds are completely self-supporting,"" Harward said by email. She added that the proposal ""does not encumber any state funds.""

We’re ready to cash out: The group's claim sidesteps the fact that taxpayers of jurisdictions benefiting from the bonds will face bond-related costs. And while the additional bond authority sought in the proposition would not cost state taxpayers--up front--state lawmakers could still exploit their standing authority, as before, to spend state revenue on related debt. This possibility is unacknowledged in the group’s claim, which we rate Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968747C0>],/factchecks/2011/nov/03/H204TEXAS-PAC/Group-says-proposed-constitutional-amendment-costs/

Rachel Maddow says Rick Perry's tax plan promises the rich huge tax cuts while everyone else would get big tax hikes
","Saying Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s presidential candidacy is foundering, liberal MSNBC commentator Rachel Maddow said on her Oct. 25, 2011, show that Perry’s flat-tax plan has dire implications.

Mentioning Republican hopeful Herman Cain’s tax plan, Maddow added: ""So, tanking Rick Perry has now come up with his own version of a flat tax that accomplishes the same goal of huge tax cuts for rich people and big tax hikes for everyone else.""

Big cuts for the rich, hikes for everyone else?

Earlier, PolitiFact rated False a Cain claim that his plan, replacing the progressive income tax with three flat taxes including a 9 percent personal income tax, would not raise taxes on those who make the least. To the contrary, the independent Tax Policy Center concluded that Cain’s plan would cut taxes for many of the wealthiest taxpayers while increasing taxes for the poorest.
   
At a glance, Perry’s proposal, which has a flat 20 percent personal income tax, would seem similarly likely to sock low-income Americans. Yet Perry would permits taxpayers to stick with the current tax system — enabling him to argue that a tax increase would not be forced on anyone. Current personal income tax rates range from 10 percent to 35 percent, with those who earn the most expected to pay the most.

Perry’s plan calls for a standard deduction of $12,500 per individual and dependent in a household and preserves deductions for mortgage interest, state and local taxes and charitable donations. He also proposes to eliminate taxes on estates, certain dividends and capital gains, as well as Social Security benefits. He also wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent.

""You can continue to pay your taxes, as well as the accountants and the lawyers, under the current tax system,"" Perry said at a South Carolina stop before he held up a postcard. ""Or you can file your taxes on this postcard.""

His speech included this claim: ""Taxes will be cut across all income groups in America.""

When we sought backup from MSNBC for Maddow’s claim, spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski pointed out news accounts calling Perry’s plan more regressive than the current income tax for reasons including the end to progressive tax rates. Also, she noted, Perry’s plan would eliminate the child care tax credit and the earned income tax credit, which enables low-to-moderate income tax filers to receive tax refunds. She passed along a comment to Yahoo News by Bruce Bartlett, a U.S. Treasury official in President George H.W. Bush’s administration, saying the removal of the refundable credits means ""you’re massively raising taxes"" for people who now pay nothing.

Bartlett said in a Nov. 1, 2011, opinion article, posted online by the New York Times, the refundable ""credits give many people a negative tax rate. That is, they pay no income taxes but still get a Treasury refund. Going from a negative rate to zero would mean a tax increase for such people.""

Skowronski pointed out an Oct. 25, 2011, Times’ blog post mentioning the loss of the earned-income tax credit. Citing a preliminary look at Perry’s plan by an expert for the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, the post said that generally, the ""highest-income households (at the 99th percentile in income) in every structure of family analyzed always benefit from opting into the Perry plan.The poorest households, on the other hand, do not.""

We wondered, though, about the crux of Maddow’s claim. Which taxpayers would get huge cuts and who, if anyone, would see big increases?

In a telephone interview, the policy center’s analyst, Roberton Williams, said the wealthy would enjoy big tax cuts under the plan because the 20 percent income-tax rate would require less from them than the current maximum rate. Also, he noted, exempting capital gains and dividends from the income tax would help wealthier taxpayers. Capital gains and dividend income are currently subject to rates of up to 15 percent.

""These are substantial cuts,"" he said.

However, he told us, the notion that everyone but the wealthy would face a big hike is incorrect since the plan allows taxpayers to continue under the current tax system.

The center later posted a detailed analysis of Perry’s plan. We realize that Maddow could not have had this analysis when she aired her claim. However, mindful that her provided backup information didn’t fully support her statement and MSNBC had referred to the center’s preliminary analysis, we figured it was OK to delve into the detailed look.

That analysis, posted Oct. 31, 2011, says that compared to current tax law, Perry’s plan would deliver a tax cut in 2015 of an average $267 to about 25 percent of the nation’s poorest 20 percent of households, with annual earnings up to $19,342. About 45 percent of the next-poorest quintile of households, earning up to $39,862, would get a cut averaging $695.

Williams said the center’s definition of current law presumes that tax cuts put in place since 2001 under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama will expire after next year, which will happen unless lawmakers intervene.

Compared to current law, Williams said, Americans earning more would fare better under Perry’s plan. At least three in four households earning $69,074 or more would experience a tax cut, averaging $1,722, with 94 percent or more earning $119,546 or more seeing cuts averaging $3,872 to $34,928, according to the center’s analysis.

The very wealthiest 0.1 percent of households, earning more than $2.87 million a year, would get average tax cuts of more than $1.9 million, the analysis says.

We asked MSNBC and Perry’s campaign for their responses.

In reply, Skowronski pointed out another part of the center’s analysis showing that compared to current policy -- that is, assuming most tax reductions put into place under Bush and Obama would not expire at the end of 2012 -- Perry’s plan would result in tax increases, on average, across the nation’s lowest 40 percent of earners. Then again, the chart indicates that 19 percent of the poorest taxpayers and 27 percent of the next-poorest quintile of earners would get a tax cut under Perry’s plan.

Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier replied by email that Perry’s plan was devised assuming current tax law, not current policy. ""We are operating under reality, not making assumptions of what may or may not happen in the future,"" Frazier said. And, she said, when ""compared to current law, Americans of all income groups are better off under the governor's tax plan.""

The center’s analysis shows ways that such a conclusion holds up, including increases after-tax income and reductions in tax rates--on average--for households at each quintile of income. On average, the poorest taxpayers would see a $66 cut in taxes while wealthier households would see greater decreases topping out at $34,004 for the wealthiest 20 percent of households, the analysis says.

The center’s Williams summed up this who-wins/who-loses aspect by telling us that not everybody would be better off under Perry’s plan, but ""every (income) group  is better off"" mainly because those who do not gain from paying the proposed 20 percent flat tax can continue paying the existing income tax.

All in all, too, the rich would make out very well. He’d be happy to be rich anyway, Williams said, but under Perry’s plan, ""I really want to be rich.""

Our ruling

Nearly all of the nation’s wealthiest residents would see tax cuts if Perry’s plan became law, in keeping with Maddow’s claim. Will they be huge? That’s an eye-of-the-beholder question, but some could be sizable by any definition.

Some other Americans--including 45 percent of residents earning $19,343 to $39,862--also would see tax cuts, a projection that does not support the claim that the plan means big tax increases for everyone but the wealthy. Perry’s plan allows every taxpayer to continue under the current system. No one would pay more unless he or she chooses the flat tax against their financial self-interest.

Maddow’s statement, leaving the incorrect impression that Perry’s tax plan hugely benefits the rich while everyone else pays more, rates Mostly False. UPDATE, 1:20 p.m., Nov. 4, 2011: We’ve amended this article to correct our initial recap of some of the Tax Policy Center’s average tax-cut forecasts for some taxpayers  under Rick Perry’s tax plan. These changes do not affect the rating.",[<zip object at 0x000002809706D100>],/factchecks/2011/nov/02/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-rick-perry-tax-plan/

Jon Huntsman accuses Mitt Romney of flip-flopping on gun control
","
Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman uses a wind-up monkey to make fun of Mitt Romney for flip-flopping in a new  Web ad.

In another item we checked whether the ad's claim that Romney had flip-flopped on abortion was accurate. In this one we're checking the claim that he has switched his position on gun control. 
In one side-by-side video comparison, the ad shows video of Romney first saying, ""We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts. I support them,"" and then saying, ""And I would protect our Second Amendment rights to bear arms.""

Clearly, the ad is charging Romney with flip-flopping on gun control. So we decided to see whether the charge is accurate.

First, let’s look at some of the things Romney has said about gun control.

• In 1994, when he was challenging Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney supported two gun control measures -- the Brady Bill, which required background checks for gun purchases, and a ban on certain types of assault weapons. Both were strongly opposed by most gun-rights advocates.

In a July 1994 question-and-answer session with voters arranged by the Boston Herald, Romney ""reaffirmed"" his support for both measures, the newspaper said. ""I don't think (the waiting period) will have a massive effect on crime, but I think it will have a positive effect,"" Romney said.

In a subsequent interview published on Sept. 23, 1994, Romney said, ""I don't want special-interest groups making this their campaign. I don't want their money. I don't want their help. This is my race."" In the interview, Romney specifically mentioned gun-rights advocates, acknowledging that his stands on the two gun-control measures would put him at odds with such groups.

""That's not going to make me the hero of the NRA,"" he said, referring to the National Rifle Association. ""I don't line up with a lot of special interest groups.""

• Then, in his 2002 race for governor, Romney said during a debate against against Democrat Shannon O'Brien, ""We have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them.""

Fast-forwarding to the present, we couldn’t find much on Romney’s 2011 positions on gun control. The issues section of his website has nothing about it, and the one time the topic came up in a debate -- an attack by Texas Gov. Rick Perry on Sept. 22, 2011, in Orlando, Fla. -- Romney didn’t take the bait. Perry said, ""I think Americans just don't know sometimes which Mitt Romney they're dealing with. Is it the Mitt Romney that was on the side of against the Second Amendment before he was for the Second Amendment?"" But Romney instead chose to respond to Perry’s subsequent charge about his position on health care.

So we turned to statements Romney made during the 2008 presidential campaign, when he ran unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination.

• Addressing a group of National Rifle Association members by video on Sept. 10, 2007, Romney said, ""Let me speak very directly and candidly about where I stand. I support the Second Amendment as one of the most basic and fundamental rights of every American. It's essential to our functioning as a free society, as are all the liberties enumerated in the Bill of Rights."" He repeated that message later that month at a meeting of the National Shooting Sports Foundation.

• In a candidate questionnaire published by the Washington Post during the 2008 primary campaign, Romney said this:

""Q: Do you think gun control has an impact on crime rates in the United States?""

""Romney: The Second Amendment protects the individual right of lawful citizens to keep and bear arms. I strongly support this essential freedom, and I applaud the recent federal appeals court decision in Washington, D.C., which concluded that the Second Amendment protects an individualized right to keep and bear arms. As president, I will support that interpretation and protect the right of every law-abiding American to keep and use firearms. With respect to gun control laws, I believe we need to distinguish between law-abiding gun owners and criminals who use guns. Those who use a firearm during the commission of a crime must be punished severely. The key is to provide law enforcement with the resources they need and punish criminals, not burden lawful gun owners.""

""Q: Do you think tighter restrictions should be in place for those buying a firearm?""

""Romney: No. I believe we need to focus on enforcing our current laws rather than creating new laws that burden lawful gun owners. I believe in safe and responsible gun ownership, and that anyone who exercises the right to keep and bear arms must do so lawfully and properly. I do not believe in a one-size-fits-all federal approach to gun ownership because people keep and use firearms for different reasons. Law-abiding citizens have a right to protect their homes and their families and as president, I will vigorously defend that right.""

• According to the Boston Globe, Romney appeared on an Internet podcast, ""The Glenn and Helen Show,"" and said that he hoped states would ease regulations on gun owners. He also expressed enthusiasm for guns and hunting. ""I have a gun of my own,"" he was quoted as saying. ""I go hunting myself. I'm a member of the NRA and believe firmly in the right to bear arms.""

• On the Oct. 21, 2007, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, host Bob Schieffer challenged Romney on the evolution of his gun-control position.

Schieffer said, ""You once said, ‘We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts, I support them, I won't chip away at them. I believe they protect us.’ Now you say you are a gun owner. You have joined the National Rifle Association, after saying at one point, ‘I don't line up with the National Rifle Association.’ Why would you join that group?""

Romney began by stating that he had the endorsement of the National Rifle Association during his run for governor, a claim he later had to back away from. He continued, ""I support the NRA. I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. They take some positions that are different than mine. But my positions are the same as my positions have been with regards to guns for a long, long time, and that is that I respect the right of people to bear arms, and whether that's for hunting or personal protection. ...""

It’s worth noting that between his 1994 and 2002 campaigns and the 2008 presidential campaign, Romney served a four-year term as governor of Massachusetts, during which he signed a major firearms-related bill.

A bill he signed in 2004 enacted a permanent ban on assault weapons -- reportedly the first such state law in the country. ""These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense,"" the Globe quoted Romney as saying. ""They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people.""

Despite that provision -- usually a deal-breaker for gun-rights groups -- the measure received support from pro-gun groups because other provisions lengthened the terms of firearm ID cards and licenses to carry firearms. The Globe reported that during the 2008 campaign, Romney described the bill as a ""consensus measure"" and a ""positive step.""

Our ruling

The evidence largely supports the contention that Romney has flip-flopped on gun rights, particularly in his tone. Romney’s message during the 1994 and 2002 campaigns was that he was a strong supporter of gun control measures, while in the 2008 president campaign, he played up his pro-Second Amendment credentials and actively sought support from the National Rifle Association and other gun-owner groups.

Substantively, the gap -- at least as of the 2008 campaign -- was somewhat narrower. He’s been vague about specific legislation he’d support, and in the interview with Schieffer, Romney acknowledged that ""I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. They take some positions that are different than mine."" Still, between his early campaigns and his 2008 presidential run, Romney does appear to have shifted his views. On balance, we rate Huntsman’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FA5680>],/factchecks/2011/nov/02/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-accuses-mitt-romney-flip-flopping-gun/

Obama ad claims credit for millions gaining health care
","
A banner ad featuring the president's smiling face proclaims ""Because of Barack Obama"" followed by four statements about his accomplishments as president. 

One of the claims: that 32 million new people will have health care. We decided to check how accurate it was. (You can see a full copy of the ad at the bottom of this report.) 
The numbers

The Obama campaign directed us to the Congressional Budget Office, which early on estimated that 32 million Americans would be covered by health insurance by 2019 under the sweeping health care reform passed by Congress and signed by Obama in 2010. CBO director Doug Elmendorf, in testimony before Congress in March 2011, moved up that timetable to 2016.

That would leave about 23 million residents uninsured, the CBO said, and about one-third of those would be undocumented immigrants. Under the legislation, the percentage of legal non-elderly residents with insurance coverage would rise from about 83 percent currently to about 94 percent.

Many of those newly insured will be people who are added to Medicaid, perhaps 16 million, according to the CBO.

This isn’t to say that the CBO’s estimates are unquestioned. Critics of the law say the way it is structured is ultimately not workable.

Rea Hederman, a budget expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, pointed out that state governments share some costs of Medicaid patients -- a burden they are trying to reduce. Hederman also predicted that ""premium increases are likely to increase the uninsured rate over time.""

In other words, as the costs of insurance rise there could be more people without insurance.

The cause

Is all this ""because of Barack Obama?""

We asked Timothy Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law in Lexington, Va. His answer: not entirely.

Going back to the 2008 presidential race, Jost said, Obama made health care reform a central issue of his campaign, but he ran against an individual mandate that would require people to purchase health insurance or face a fine. Then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton backed it, but candidate Obama said it should only cover children.

The landscape changed after Obama was elected and so did his position on the individual mandate. The fight to pass health care reform grew bitterly divided. In the fall of 2009, Jost noted, and particularly in the winter of 2010 after Republican Scott Brown won a Massachusetts Senate seat that cost Democrats their filibuster-proof majority, ""it was only the leadership of President Obama that got the job done.""

""The (health care law) would never have passed without his leadership and his pressure on the House and Senate to cross the finish line,"" Jost said.

Still, the law was not his creation. Democratic senators Max Baucus, Harry Reid, John Rockefeller and Tom Harkin were the main authors, and Jost added that a number of Republicans got provisions into the act.

And even now that the bill has become law, its future is uncertain. Most importantly, it is being challenged in the courts in multiple states on the grounds that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. In separate rulings, the 11th U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta struck down the mandate but upheld the rest of the law, while the 6th Circuit in Cincinnati concluded that the law’s insurance requirement is constitutional. The matter is widely expected to end up in front of the United States Supreme Court, and if the individual mandate is struck down, it’s reasonable that millions fewer Americans will gain health coverage.

Why? Because ""when coverage is optional, older and sicker people who expect to have substantial health expenditures are the most likely to be insured, while younger and healthier people with little expected health spending have a greater tendency to be uninsured,"" a recent story in Health Affairs, a health policy journal, said. The law is designed to avoid this effect by mandating that everyone has coverage so that costs are spread across the population.

A number of studies have examined the effect of the law without the mandate. Health Affairs concluded that about 8 million fewer people would be insured without the mandate. A study by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, estimates 24 million fewer insured, and the CBO came down in the middle, predicting that 16 million fewer people would be insured without the mandate.

Of course, if you’re Obama, you’re going to campaign on the assumption that the health care law, including the individual mandate, will be upheld.

Our ruling

The Obama campaign ad said ""Because of Barack Obama 32 million new people will have healthcare.""

As things now stand, the predicted number holds up. Though an estimate, it comes from a nonpartisan source, the Congressional Budget Office.

But the health reform law, and the individual mandate in particular, faces serious challenges. If it is ultimately struck down by the Supreme Court, millions fewer will gain insurance coverage.

Finally, the president isn’t solely responsible for health reform becoming law. It was the result of an epic fight in Congress that pitted the two parties against each other. Obama, however, was a major force for that fight ending in passage of the law. We rate the claim Mostly True.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Jon Huntsman']","
Jon Huntsman accuses Mitt Romney of flip-flopping on abortion
","
To make fun of Mitt Romney for flip-flopping, a new web ad from former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman uses a wind-up monkey.

In one side-by-side video comparison, the ad shows video of Romney first saying, ""I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country,"" then saying, ""I have consistently been pro-life.""

Clearly, the ad is charging Romney with flip-flopping on abortion. So we decided to see whether the charge is accurate.

First, let’s look at some of the things Romney said earlier in his career about abortion, when he was waging a losing bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts and winning the governorship a few years later. Here are two of the clearest statements of his position.

•  In a debate during his 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, ""I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country."" Referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that lmade abortion legal in every state, Romney added, ""I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice.""

•  In his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, ""I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.""

We believe that these two comments -- made in highly public forums and eight years apart -- represent pretty solid evidence that Romney was an abortion-rights supporter during that phase of his political career.

What about his views today? The ""issues"" portion of his website doesn’t list abortion, but Romney wrote a June 18, 2011, op-ed in the conservative National Review that lays out his abortion views pretty clearly. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group.

""I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services.

""I will reinstate the Mexico City Policy to ensure that nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from America refrain from performing or promoting abortion services as a method of family planning, in other countries.  This includes ending American funding for any United Nations or other foreign assistance program that promotes or performs abortions on women around the world.

""I will advocate for and support a Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion. And perhaps most importantly, I will only appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written.""

Our ruling

Abortion opponents may disagree on exactly where on the anti-abortion spectrum Romney falls, and questions have been raised about how fully and quickly Romney made his ideological transition after the event he cites as the spark -- a meeting with a Harvard stem-cell researcher in 2004.

Still, we believe these issues are outside the scope of the claim in Huntsman’s ad. Simply put, Romney’s views on abortion are vastly different today than what he expressed in the 1994 and 2002 debates. Huntsman’s claim that Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion rates a True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ABD200>],/factchecks/2011/nov/02/jon-huntsman/Says-Mitt-Romney-flip-flopped-on-abortion/

Herman Cain said China is trying to develop nuclear weapons
","
People are talking about Herman Cain and allegations of sexual harassment from the time he was head of the National Restaurant Association.

But what about his China policy?

Cain, the former head of Godfather’s Pizza, is seeking the Republican nomination and has been leading the polls in recent weeks. He sat down for an interview with the PBS Newshour that began with questions about two female employees who left the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. Cain said the charges against him were false.

The interview then turned to questions about policy, leading to this exchange:

Judy Woodruff: ""Do you view China as a potential military threat to the United States?""

Cain: ""I do view China as a potential military threat to the United States.""

Woodruff: ""And what could you do as president to head that off?""

Cain: ""My China strategy is quite simply outgrow China. It gets back to economics. China has a $6 trillion economy and they're growing at approximately 10 percent. We have a $14 trillion economy -- much bigger -- but we're growing at an anemic 1.5, 1.6 percent. When we get our economy growing back at the rate of 5 or 6 percent that it has the ability to do, we will outgrow China.

""And secondly, we already have superiority in terms of our military capability, and I plan to get away from making cutting our defense a priority and make investing in our military capability a priority, going back to my statement: peace through strength and clarity. So yes, they're a military threat. They've indicated that they're trying to develop nuclear capability, and they want to develop more aircraft carriers like we have. So yes, we have to consider them a military threat.""

Cain got our attention by saying that China is ""trying to develop nuclear capability."" We were under the impression that China has been a nuclear power for some time now. So we decided to check his statement.

Our first stop was the U.S. State Department website. Its background note on China has the following summary of China’s nuclear capability:

""In 1955, Mao Zedong's Chinese Communist Party decided to proceed with a nuclear weapons program; it was developed with Soviet assistance until the Sino-Soviet split ended that assistance. After its first nuclear test in October 1964, Beijing deployed a modest but potent ballistic missile force, including land- and sea-based intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles.""

Then there’s this, from the U.S. Defense Department 2010 Nuclear Posture Review Report:

""While facing the increasingly urgent threats of nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation, the United States must continue to address the more familiar challenge of ensuring strategic stability with existing nuclear powers – most notably Russia and China. … The United States and China are increasingly interdependent and their shared responsibilities for addressing global security threats, such as weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferation and terrorism, are growing. At the same time, the United States and China’s Asian neighbors remain concerned about China’s current military modernization efforts, including its qualitative and quantitative modernization of its nuclear arsenal. China’s nuclear arsenal remains much smaller than the arsenals of Russia and the United States. But the lack of transparency surrounding its nuclear programs – their pace and scope, as well as the strategy and doctrine that guides them – raises questions about China’s future strategic intentions.""

In recent years, the United States has been concerned that China is sharing nuclear technology and weapons with other countries, particularly Pakistan and Iran. In January 2011, the United States and China signed an agreement to create a Center of Excellence in China to promote nuclear security and safeguards.

We contacted the Cain campaign for comment on this, but we didn’t hear back.

Cain said that China ""indicated that they're trying to develop nuclear capability."" According to the U.S. State Department, China conducted its first test of a nuclear weapon in 1964. So Cain’s approximately 40 years behind the times. China is a long-standing nuclear power. We rate his statement Pants on Fire. 
Editor's note: After we published this item, Cain addressed his statement in an interview with the Daily Caller website. ""Maybe I mispoke,"" Cain said. ""What I meant was, China does not have the size of nuclear capability that we have. They do have a nuclear capability.""",[<zip object at 0x0000028097473180>],/factchecks/2011/nov/02/herman-cain/herman-cain-said-china-trying-develop-nuclear-weap/
"['Labor', 'Wisconsin', 'MacIver Institute']","
Conservative group says Wisconsin state employees paid to bring lunch to work
","
When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker proposed freezing state employee pay for two years, a conservative think tank pointed out that his plan also eliminates what it called abuse of overtime and ""odd"" types of other employee compensation.

The Madison-based MacIver Institute weighed in with an online video posted Oct. 25, 2011, the same day the proposal was released. The institute noted, for example, that Department of Corrections employees would no longer be allowed to call in sick for one shift, then work the shift immediately following on overtime.

That practice had been revealed more than three years earlier by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

But the institute also made a claim in the video we hadn’t heard:

""Other odd provisions in the old contracts gave some employees $4 for bringing in their own lunch.""

A $4 reimbursement might not seem like much -- but state employees being paid to bring their lunch to work? Who? And how many?

We decided to take a look.

The MacIver Institute, on the day it released its video, also posted an article about Walker’s pay-freeze plan. The article elaborated on the $4 lunch claim, saying the plan would eliminate a provision in one contract that allows police communications operators to be reimbursed $4 if they work through their lunch period.

We asked MacIver Institute spokesman Brian Fraley if he had any evidence to back up the claim. He cited the state’s 2008-2009 contract with the Wisconsin Law Enforcement Association union.

The contract says police communications operators who work shifts of eight hours or longer ""without relief for a meal break are eligible for a $4 bag meal.""  

Let’s flesh this out a bit.

The Wisconsin Law Enforcement Association represents several hundred employees of the State Patrol, the Capitol Police and the police departments that serve University of Wisconsin System campuses, said the union’s president, Tracy Fuller. Police communications operators are dispatchers who work for the State Patrol, he said.

The ""bag lunch"" reference in the contract simply indicates that when dispatchers have to bring a lunch to eat while remaining on the job through their lunch period, they are reimbursed $4, Fuller said. The provision enables managers to ensure that dispatch staffing has no gaps, especially if a dispatcher has to work longer than expected due to an incident, he said.

The reimbursement applies to about 50 or 60 dispatchers and the $4 rate hasn’t been changed since the provision was added to their contract about eight years ago, Fuller said.

We asked state Department of Administration spokesman Tim Lundquist how much the state spends per year on the $4  lunch reimbursement, but he said figures weren’t available. He said that even though the contract that covers the dispatchers has expired, provisions such as the lunch reimbursement have remained in place and will remain until a new pay plan is adopted.

If adopted by the Legislature’s GOP-controlled Joint Committee on Employment Relations, likely in early to mid-November, Walker’s pay plan would take effect Jan. 1, 2012.

Our conclusion

The MacIver Institute said Walker’s pay proposal would eliminate various state employee contract provisions, including one that ""gave some employees $4 for bringing in their own lunch.""

State dispatchers don’t get $4 just for bringing a lunch to work; the reimbursement applies only when they are required to eat while continuing to work through their lunch period.

The statement was accurate but needed some clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809706D040>],/factchecks/2011/nov/02/maciver-institute/conservative-group-says-wisconsin-state-employees-/
"['New Jersey', 'Taxes', 'Joseph Chiusolo']","
Essex County’s property taxes among highest in the nation
","
Essex County residents have a second-place finish to marvel at -- only it’s not one they may be too happy about.

In his bid to unseat county Freeholder Leonard Luciano, Republican candidate Joseph Chiusolo pointed to the county’s high property taxes in an Oct. 25 press release. 
In fact, according to Chiusolo, ""Essex County residents suffer the second highest property taxes in the nation.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Chiusolo’s statistic was accurate to some degree. In terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of the median household income, Essex County ranks second in the nation.

But when two other types of measurements are considered, Essex County is up there, but not second.

""The bottom line is, if you’re sixth or two, the taxes are high,"" Chiusolo told us. ""People out there are hurting.""

Let’s explain where Chiusolo received his numbers.

Chiusolo, the deputy mayor of Cedar Grove, referred us to data compiled by the Washington, DC-based Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy. The data represents five-year averages for the period between 2005 and 2009.

For that time period, the Tax Foundation ranked property taxes in owner-occupied homes in counties according to three measurements: median property taxes paid; taxes as a percentage of the median home value; and taxes as a percentage of the median household income. Each statistic comes with a margin of error.

On that last measurement, Essex County ranked second among 2,922 counties with property taxes representing about 8.04 percent of the median household income. The only county above Essex was neighboring Passaic County, where property taxes were about 8.44 percent.

So, Chiusolo is right on that point, but according to those two other measurements, Essex County didn't score as high.

Essex County’s median property tax bill was about $7,489, ranking it sixth in the nation. At about 1.9 percent of the median home value, Essex County ranked 92nd.

Thomas Ammirato, a consultant working on Chiusolo‘s campaign, pointed out how an earlier press release specified that the ranking refers to the percentage of income. But we told Ammirato that this fact-check is based on the Oct. 25 press release.

Still, Chiusolo’s overall point is accurate that Essex County has some of the highest property taxes in the nation -- and as far as other New Jersey counties, it’s not alone.

Among the top 10 counties for the five-year average of median property taxes paid, seven of them are in New Jersey: Hunterdon, Bergen, Essex, Somerset, Morris, Union and Passaic.

One of the major factors behind the rankings is the high property values in New Jersey, according to Mark Robyn, an economist with the Tax Foundation.

Kim Rueben, who directs the state and local program of the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, added that part of the reason for high property taxes in the Garden State is that a lot of money to pay for local schools comes from property taxes.

New Jersey also has more generous government services than other states, Rueben said.

""It’s a high government-service state,"" Rueben said. ""New Jersey has relatively high taxes and relatively generous public spending.""

Our ruling

In a press release, Chiusolo claimed ""Essex County residents suffer the second highest property taxes in the nation.""

That’s true if you’re looking at property taxes as a percentage of the median household income. But Essex County’s property taxes rank sixth and 92nd according to two other measurements. We rate the statement Half True.
