No, that Olympics hot mic video isn’t real — it’s a joke
","A spoof video shared on a comedian’s Twitter page has journeyed from joke to scandal as some people sharing and seeing it online appear to believe it’s authentic.  It’s not.  But here’s the premise: an NBC producer is caught on a hot mic saying: ""We just spoke to a chief medical examiner. They said 60% of people in this stadium will be dead within 10 days. They’re thinking of using the swimming pool as a mass grave. Did you know that? Yeah they’re just going to start burning bodies.""   A post sharing the video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

NBC is broadcasting the Olympics in the United States.  Comedian Tim Dillon shared the video on his Twitter account on July 23, writing, ""Man this is crazy. NBC employee fired after hot mic incident at Olympics.""  Some users are clearly in on the joke, like those commenting on a post in a forum that describes the video as the ""greatest hot mic moment ever.""

It’s not true that the women’s U.S. soccer team kneeled during the national anthem at the Olympics
","A photo and caption circulating on Facebook would have social media users believe that several members of the U.S. women’s soccer team kneeled during the American national anthem before their defeat in the delayed 2020 Olympic opener.  A Facebook user on July 21 shared a photo that shows eight of 11 members of the team kneeling. In the photo, the other three team members are shown standing with their left hand behind their back and their right over their heart, which suggests the national anthem is playing. The caption accompanying the photo reads, ""Our U.S. Women's Soccer Team LOST to Sweden."" Similar posts popped up on Twitter, with one tweet sharing the same photo alongside the caption: ""They just lost 3-0 to Sweden. That’s what you get for kneeling to George Floyd.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The captions paired with the photo suggest that the image depicts a scene from the Tokyo Olympics, but that is not the case. A Google Image search shows this image is from the 2021 SheBelieves Cup, which was held Feb. 18-24 in Orlando, Fla. Other fact-checking outlets have also debunked the claim that this photo was taken at the Tokyo Olympics — and disproven as false the claim that any teams took a knee during their country’s national anthem. They didn’t. In its 2020 Olympic debut on July 21, the U.S. women’s national team lost 3-0 to Sweden. The loss ended a 44-game winning streak for the U.S. team, which had been knocked out of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics by Sweden and had hoped to have a better showing against its rival in 2020. The U.S. team — along with four other Olympic teams, including Sweden — participated in a protest against discrimination and racial inequality by taking a knee before its first match.  The Associated Press reported that the soccer players who dropped to their knees ahead of their matches on July 21 ""were the first athletes to use the Olympic platform for a display of activism"" since the International Olympic Committee changed the rules to allow protests within limited parameters. The IOC’s rules state that athletes ""have the opportunity to express their views"" during the games ""on the field of play prior to the start of the competition (i.e. after leaving the ‘call room’ (or similar area) or during the introduction of the individual athlete or team)."" The IOC also specified that the protests must not directly target countries or individuals and cannot be ""disruptive.""  The guidelines still prohibit acts of protest during competition on the field of play, during official ceremonies including victory ceremonies and in the Olympic Village.  Neither the U.S. women’s national team nor the other four teams that protested racism by kneeling before their matches appear to have been in violation of the new Olympic rules.  Members of the teams kneeled when the referee’s whistle blew, as pregame music continued to play. When the U.S. and Swedish women’s teams took a knee, NPR reported that ""a referee joined the players at midfield in dropping to the turf on one knee"" as did an assistant referee.  Yahoo! Sports explicitly said, ""All 18 USWNT players stood for the anthem on Wednesday. It's unclear if a protest during the anthem would be acceptable under the new IOC rules.""  One photo on Getty Images also depicts members of the U.S. women’s soccer team standing during the U.S. national anthem on July 21.  Posts on social media suggest that a photograph shows some members of the U.S. women’s soccer team kneeling during the national anthem at the Tokyo Olympics.  In reality, the photo was taken in February 2021 at the SheBelieves Cup in Florida — not at the 2020 Olympics.  Members of the U.S. women’s national team took a knee on July 21 ahead of their first Olympic match in Japan. They were standing during the U.S. national anthem.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/26/facebook-posts/its-not-true-womens-us-soccer-team-kneeled-during-/

Large-scale testing, not individual testing, tells when delta variant causes COVID-19
","Public health experts say the delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus appears to be twice as contagious as the original coronavirus, and has become the dominant strain in the United States. So, we must have a test that diagnoses this new mutation, right? With a rhetorical question, a meme that shows a pensive Albert Einstein doubts the existence of the variant by claiming there is no test for it, saying:   ""SINCE THERE IS NO ‘DELTA VARIANT’ TEST EXACTLY HOW ARE PEOPLE BEING DIAGNOSED WITH DELTA VARIANT."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No one is being diagnosed with the delta variant, or any other variant. Routine tests that individuals receive to determine whether they have COVID-19 do not reveal whether the disease was caused by the delta variant.  But through what is known as genomic sequencing, public health officials examine samples of cases to estimate what percentage were caused by delta. Genomic sequencing from a positive test sample, said Stephen Morse, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Medical Center, ""would tell you unequivocally what variant infected that person."" A variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one that has mutated in a way that bolsters its spread or severity compared with the original strain that emerged in Wuhan, China. Public health officials have noted four ""variants of concern"" circulating in the United States, including delta, formally called B.1.617.2. Discovered in India in December 2020 and in the U.S. in March 2021, it is the most transmissible of the four variants. While it is not yet known if the delta produces more serious illness, it threatens to accelerate the spread of the pandemic. If individual testing doesn’t reveal delta, how do we know it is in play? The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains how it tracks variants by analyzing some 750 samples per week from state health departments and other public health agencies and making estimates: ""The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes instructions organized into sections, called genes, to build the virus. Scientists use a process called genomic sequencing to decode the genes and learn more about the virus. Genomic sequencing allows scientists to identify SARS-CoV-2 and monitor how it changes over time into new variants, understand how these changes affect the characteristics of the virus, and use this information to better understand how it might impact health."" In the U.S., delta is the cause of more than 80% of new COVID-19 cases, according to the CDC. Individuals are not being diagnosed with the delta variant. Routine individual tests don’t reveal whether COVID-19 was caused by the delta variant. Scientists use genomic sequencing to determine what percentage of cases were caused by the variant.  This post contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.  We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/26/facebook-posts/large-scale-not-individual-testing-tells-when-delt/

Spotify’s Joe Rogan repeats inaccurate claim that ‘they are monitoring SMS texts’
","In a recent episode of his popular podcast, Spotify host Joe Rogan implied that the government is ""monitoring SMS texts for dangerous misinformation about COVID vaccines."" That’s not true. The effort Rogan was referring to is not about intercepting or screening private text messages, and there’s no evidence the government is involved with it, as PolitiFact has reported. The misleading claim came about an hour and a half into the podcast as Rogan, whose show was the most popular podcast on Spotify in 2020, discussed issues of surveillance and privacy with journalist Abby Martin, his guest for the July 20 episode.  ""Look, we’re living in a panopticon here,"" Martin said. ""We’re in a surveillance state that is undoubtedly so."" Martin then asked Rogan if he thought his emails were being watched.  ""I assume all my emails are monitored,"" Rogan said in response. ""But have you seen the new thing about SMS text messages to stop COVID vaccine misinformation? ""They are monitoring SMS texts for dangerous misinformation about COVID vaccines,"" Rogan continued. ""Now look, misinformation is not good, right, with anything. But who’s deciding?""  Rogan’s claim was vague about who ""they"" are and what messages were being monitored, but in context of discussion of a ""surveillance state,"" it gave the false impression that the government is screening private texts between family and friends — a claim that several conservative politicians and pundits, such as Sen. Josh Hawley and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, made more explicitly. That allegation grew out of a Politico report about the Biden White House’s efforts to fight back against what it perceives as misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines. The July 12 report included this nugget about SMS text messages: ""Biden allied groups, including the Democratic National Committee, are also planning to engage fact-checkers more aggressively and work with SMS carriers to dispel misinformation about vaccines that is sent over social media and text messages. The goal is to ensure that people who may have difficulty getting a vaccination because of issues like transportation see those barriers lessened or removed entirely."" DNC spokesman Lucas Acosta told PolitiFact that the party is merely notifying companies that facilitate bulk texting about broadcast SMSs that spread misinformation. Broadcast SMSs are messages that organizers blast out to large lists of subscribers, often through an application such as Twilio or Bandwidth. ""When the DNC's counter-disinformation program receives complaints or reports of fraudulent broadcast SMSs that we believe violate the text aggregators’ terms of service, we notify the broadcast text platform to help combat this troubling trend,"" Acosta said.  ""Of course the DNC has no ability to access or read people’s private text messages, and we are not working with any government agency, including the White House, to try to see personal text messages,"" Acosta said. ""The only texts reviewed are those distributed en masse to American citizens through broadcast text platforms and reported to the DNC."" Speaking about the effort on his podcast, Rogan did not distinguish between the government and the DNC, or between the personal texts exchanged between individuals and the type of mass texts blasted to mailing lists that the DNC is concerned about, leaving room for confusion.  Politico reporter Natasha Korecki, who co-authored the report that spawned the false claims of government spying, said in a pair of tweets that the White House is not involved, and that ""there is no ability for groups to read individual texts aside from the ones they receive themselves."" And CTIA, a trade group representing the wireless communications industry, said in a statement: ""Wireless carriers do not read or moderate the content of text messages that their customers send to each other, nor are carriers working with third parties to do so."" A Spotify representative declined to comment on behalf of the company and Rogan. In a conversation about privacy and living in ""a surveillance state,"" Rogan said, ""They are monitoring SMS texts for dangerous misinformation about COVID vaccines."" Rogan’s vague references to ""they"" and ""SMS texts"" could have left some listeners with the misleading impression that the government is snooping on all text messages that Americans send and receive, including private messages.  That’s not the case. The effort he alluded to comes from the Democratic National Committee, which is alerting companies that facilitate bulk text messaging to reports about mass text messages that spread misinformation in violation of their terms of service. The government is not involved, and no messages are being screened. The statement leaves out context that could give a different impression.

Are high lumber prices 'tied' to the Trump administration?
","A North Carolina congresswoman says former President Donald Trump is partly to blame for an increase in lumber prices. U.S. Rep. Alma Adams, a Charlotte area Democrat, raised the issue when questioning Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about inflation during a committee meeting on July 14.  Adams wanted to know why Powell believes the recent inflation trends are temporary. And while winding up for her question, she said a rise in lumber prices ""can be tied to the previous administration’s actions."" ""My local housing partnership had to pause construction of an affordable housing site because of a funding gap caused by the spike in lumber prices. And while lumber prices can be tied to the previous administration’s actions, I know that many are still concerned about the rise in core prices.""  ""So I’m hoping you can help us put some of these concerns to bed. So would you tell us why you believe the recent inflation trends are temporary as the economy reopens and what other factors are playing into the upward pressure on prices?"" Later that day, a Twitter user challenged Adams’ explanation. She responded by elaborating on her comments in a tweet.  ""The Trump Administration's high tariffs on Canadian lumber drove prices higher. Supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic compounded the problem and drove prices even higher,"" she tweeted on July 14. Is she right about that? Trump did place a tariff on Canadian lumber and it’s fair for Adams to point out that it caused lumber prices to rise, experts told us. However, experts say lumber prices are more complicated than her statement suggests. There are a number of reasons why the recent rise in lumber prices isn’t entirely — or even primarily a result of — Trump’s tariffs. By the time Trump imposed tariffs on lumber in 2017, prices were already on the rise because of uncertainty surrounding an expired trade agreement. The U.S. and Canada had a 10-year trade pact that expired at the end of 2016. David Logan, director of tax and trade analysis for the National Association of Home Builders, wrote in March 2017 that ""failure to reach a new (trade) agreement is the primary catalyst of market-wide price increases."" A month later, the Trump administration announced tariffs of 20% on Canadian lumber and up to 24% on specific lumber companies. Lumber prices have a history of being volatile, experts told PolitiFact. They can range from $300 to $600 per thousand board feet when in stable economic times. The price hovered just below $400 per thousand board feet in early 2017, and then rose to $600 by summer 2018.  It’s fair to say Trump’s tariffs contributed to that rise, experts told PolitiFact. Other factors played a role too. Lumber market expert Paul F. Jannke, a principal at Forest Economic Advisors, told the New York Times that a reduction in the supply of Canadian lumber also contributed to the rise in prices. Fast forward to 2020. When the pandemic takes hold, some saw mills shut down or cut production as they anticipate decreased demand. But their predictions were wrong. More Americans started to work from home and decided to undertake home renovation projects. Demand for lumber rises and prices reach $950 per thousand board feet in September, according to the NAHB. In the meantime, the World Trade Organization ruled in August that the Trump administration’s justification for the 2017 lumber tariff was off-base. And late last year, the U.S. Commerce Department slashed the softwood lumber tariff to 9%. Last year’s rise in prices was just the start. Lumber prices hit an all-time high of $1,670 per thousand board feet this May as demand rose for a limited supply, CNBC reported. The lumber industry’s struggle to keep up with demand has been well-documented in American media, from Vox and CNN to Fortune and Bloomberg. Experts told PolitiFact there are many factors that determine the price of lumber. Trump’s tariff is one of those factors but isn’t the leading cause of the spike. The price increases ""can be traced back to mill closures and a massive reduction of output upon reopening based on the incorrect assumption that the housing market would indefinitely tank,"" Logan, the NAHB expert, told PolitiFact in April. Sam Spencer, a spokesperson for Adams, said the Congresswoman’s tweet accurately summarized the effect of tariffs. ""The price of lumber can be tied to the tariffs: if there is a supply crunch, the fact that we’re artificially elevating the price of that specific commodity’s importation by default contributes to the rise in prices,"" Spencer said in an email. While the tariffs certainly helped cause lumber prices to jump in 2018, ""that second round increase isn’t related to the Trump tariff,"" said Vincent Smith, an expert in agricultural policy at the American Enterprise Institute. ""That was a demand side driven surge."" Adams is ""not wrong about the impact of the Trump tariffs in 2017,"" Smith said, adding: ""that doesn’t explain the surge in prices subsequently."" The softwood lumber tariff ""doesn't help,"" said Thomas A. Firey, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and managing editor of its Regulation Magazine. ""However, the tariff is set and adjusted by statute, and it's unfair for the congresswoman to blame Trump for initiating it (or Biden, whose administration is obligated to raise it),"" Firey told PolitiFact in an email. Fact-checkers at USA Today reached a similar conclusion.  Scott Lincicome, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Cato Institute, says the fluctuating cost of lumber in the U.S. is a result of a trade system that’s overdue for reform. The regulations affecting how much lumber is made available, who’s allowed to produce it, and how it’s taxed -- are designed to benefit the American lumber industry, sometimes at the expense of the consumer. The system’s drawbacks are exacerbated during seasons of high demand. ""It's factually true that the Trump administration’s Commerce Department applied the tariffs, but beyond that casting the blame is pretty nonsensical,"" Lincicome said.  Experts pointed out too that Biden was in office as lumber prices peaked, and hasn’t acted to reduce the tariffs. The Commerce Department is now proposing to double the lumber tariff to 18%. CNN and Fortune Magazine report that Biden, for his part, has yet to take a stance on the proposal. Adams, referencing Trump’s time as president, said ""lumber prices can be tied to the previous administration’s actions."" She later tweeted an assertion that Trump’s tariffs were a cause. Trump increased the tariff on Canadian lumber in 2017 and prices rose in the following year. However, prices skyrocketed even higher in the last year as a result of pandemic-era market changes. Economists say that’s largely the result of unforeseen issues of supply and demand. While Trump’s tariffs contributed to the record-high lumber prices, economists say it’s misleading to blame them entirely. Adams’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

No, California Does Not Have A Personal Belief Exemption For COVID-19 Vaccines For Kids
","A prominent California anti-vaccination group recently posted an image on Instagram falsely claiming that the state has a personal belief exemption for any new vaccine mandated for children attending school. ""Share everywhere because you will not be told by doctors or schools,"" the image reads. ""California has a personal belief exemption to any new vaccine added to the schedule after June 2015 for public and private daycare, preschool and K-12.""  The image was posted on June 21 by members of Freedom Angels, an anti-vaccination organization founded by a trio of women in 2019. It falsely cites California Senate Bill 277, which was passed in 2015. ""Use it to fight for your children,"" the image reads. A post from Denise Aguilar, one of the founders of the group, racked up more than 6,500 likes and hundreds of comments. Aguilar also shared the image in a private Telegram channel, where it was viewed by almost 2,000 people. Tara Thornton, another founder, shared the image on her page, garnering more than 250 likes.  Both women shared the image in both Spanish and English. Additionally, the image was shared via a secondary account for Freedom Angels, which appears to have multiple accounts on Instagram. Facebook flagged the image as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.) We decided to find out whether the image’s claims are accurate. A history of California vaccination laws Senate Bill 277 was introduced in the aftermath of an outbreak of measles at Disneyland in 2014. It’s primary author was state Sen. Richard Pan, a Democrat representing Sacramento and Yolo counties and a pediatrician. The bill removed personal belief exemptions for mandated vaccinations against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, hepatitis B, influenza type B, polio, whooping cough, tetanus and chickenpox. Until then, California had technically required these vaccinations for school-aged children but had allowed parents to opt out for any reason with personal belief exemptions, making it one of the more lenient states in the country for vaccination mandates. When the law was passed in June 2015, it became one of the toughest vaccination mandates in the nation. Without a medical exemption, the only way parents could opt out of vaccinating their children was to home-school them or enroll them in an independent study program without classroom instruction.  The measure was contentious and drew large crowds of parents against vaccinations to Sacramento to voice their displeasure. Pan and co-author state Sen. Ben Allen (D–Santa Monica) both reported receiving death threats while the bill was being debated. Pan argued that the law would help boost immunization rates and help prevent outbreaks similar to the one at Disneyland, which ultimately infected more than 150 people from eight different states, Mexico and Canada. Four years later, Pan introduced another bill in response to rising medical exemption rates statewide. The bill, which ultimately passed, cracked down on medical exemptions by creating a review process that gave public health officials the final say on waivers. It was accompanied by weeks of protest, some of which were so large and vocal that they shut down activity in the state Capitol building. Critics claimed the law would shut down access to waivers for kids who needed them and that doctors would fear the law’s investigative process. What does SB 277 mean for flu, HPV and COVID-19 vaccinations? The image claimed that SB 277 includes a clause that establishes personal belief exemptions for any new vaccine mandated for children attending school. Currently, flu, HPV and COVID-19 vaccinations are not required for California students under Senate Bill 277. In fact, COVID-19 vaccinations have yet to be approved for children under the age of 12. Drugmakers are currently testing their vaccines in young children and are expected to have results for children aged 5 through 11 by early fall.  Once the vaccines are fully approved for young children, it’s unclear whether lawmakers will consider adding the COVID-19 vaccine to the schedule of mandated shots. That means there are currently no personal belief exemptions for these vaccinations, because they are not mandated in the first place. At the moment, parents can choose whether to vaccinate their children against these diseases. But if those vaccinations were to be added to the state’s list of mandatory shots, experts say a personal belief exemption may not apply — depending on how the new vaccines are added to the list. Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at UC Hastings and a member of the Vaccine Working Group on Ethics and Policy, said the law included a clause that allows the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) to mandate new vaccinations. If vaccinations are added to the schedule in this way, the law stipulates that personal belief exemptions must be offered to parents and students. ""New vaccines required — like COVID, flu, HPV — will have a [personal belief exemption] if, and only if, the department of health adds them without going through the legislature,"" Reiss said. ""If the Legislature adds them, the Legislature will set the terms."" That means that the state Legislature could choose to pass legislation that adds a vaccination to the current list without offering a personal belief exemption. ""The Legislature may at any time amend or pass a new statute to add a required immunization,"" said Brandon Stracener, a senior research fellow at UC Berkeley Law School’s California Constitution Center. ""This additional restriction on the department, an executive regulatory agency, reflects a balance between the greater speed with which agencies can react and the more direct voter accountability legislators face."" SB 277 also included a clause that grandfathered in some children who had personal belief exemptions on file with their schools prior to the passage of the legislation. Stracener said those students are permitted to maintain their exemptions until they enter a new ""grade span"" when moving from preschool to elementary school or from elementary school to middle and high school. ""This temporary, transitional safeguard will apply to fewer and fewer, and eventually, no students as the years progress,"" Stacener said. Adding vaccines It’s unclear whether COVID-19 vaccinations will be required for students in the future, but experts say they expect the legislature would take charge if state officials sought to mandate it. Reiss said the CDPH has yet to add a vaccination of its own to the list since SB 277 passed in 2015. ""I expect that if it's added, it would be added by the legislature,"" she said. ""That's how all currently mandated vaccines were added. I think the CDPH would be very cautious of the political implications if it went at this without legislative mandate."" That means there likely would not be a personal belief exemption. ""The [CDPH] could attempt to deem coronavirus an appropriate disease under these statutes to require immunization,"" Stracener said. ""But the legislature might have to respond itself if a large enough number of asserted personal belief exemptions made it clear that the legislature would have to act to ensure public safety."" Our Rating Posts on Instagram spread by anti-vaccination advocates claimed that California has a personal belief exemption for any new vaccine mandated after the passage of Senate Bill 277. But experts say this is not the whole story. The law includes a clause that gives the California Department of Public Health the ability to add mandated vaccinations to the current schedule. For vaccinations added this way, the law stipulates that personal belief exemptions must be offered. The state Legislature can also add vaccinations to the mandated list of shots. If a vaccination is added this way, lawmakers can choose whether they should include personal belief exemptions to the vaccine. The posts further claimed that these exemptions would apply to flu, HPV and COVID-19 vaccinations, even though those shots have not been added to the state’s list of mandated vaccinations. It’s unclear whether the COVID-19 vaccination will be mandated for students in California. If it is, experts said they expect the Legislature would take the lead on mandating the shots and it’s likely personal belief exemptions would not apply. In short, personal belief exemptions do not currently exist for any mandated vaccination in California and there is only one process that would require personal belief exemptions to be offered for any new shots.

Joe Biden is wrong when he says car prices are back to pre-pandemic levels
","During a recent CNN town hall, a questioner pressed President Joe Biden about price increases during the economic recovery, including higher prices for cars. ""First of all, the good news is the economy is picking up significantly,"" Biden said during the July 21 town hall in Cincinnati. ""It's rational, when you think about it. The cost of an automobile is kind of back to what it was before the pandemic."" That’s not correct, by any metric we could find.  A shortage in microchips has slowed new-car production, and a decreased supply of new cars has pushed more potential purchasers into the used car market. That, in turn, has prompted prices of used cars to skyrocket. Meanwhile, there’s no immediate end in sight for the microchip shortage, so the higher prices could be with us for a while.  The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Federal data shows the comparison clearly. Every month, the federal government computes the increase in prices for a wide variety of consumer goods, including new and used cars. For new and used cars, prices were stable for years but began to increase in the summer of 2020. By June 2021, prices were up almost 21% over their level right before the pandemic hit.   Most of this increase was driven by prices for used cars. New cars rose by 5.3% over that period, but used cars rose by 43.3%. This trend is echoed by data compiled by private-sector companies that track auto sales. Kelley Blue Book found that the average transaction price for a new light vehicle hit a record in June 2021, at $42,258. ""In June, for the first time in a decade, vehicle buyers were essentially paying sticker price – the manufacturer's suggested retail price – for new vehicles,"" said Kayla Reynolds, an industry intelligence analyst at Cox Automotive, which owns Kelley Blue Book. Edmunds, which tracks automobile prices, found that even well-worn vehicles are flying off sales lots with big premiums. The average transaction price for vehicles with mileage between 100,000 and 110,000 climbed 31% to a record $16,489 in June 2021, compared with $12,626 a year earlier.  And J.D. Power found that wholesale auction prices for used cars, which help determine the prices that consumers face downstream, are 39% above their level in December 2020. We should note that the chip shortage is not the only factor in the price rise. Consumer preferences — mainly for bigger, more tricked-out vehicles — have driven price increases for several years.  Americans have been ""opting to purchase more expensive and larger vehicles, even during the pandemic,"" said Talia James-Armand, an associate director for communications with Edmunds. She shared Edmunds data showing that passenger cars are relatively affordable, whereas SUVs and trucks are doing the most to push up average vehicle prices.   In any case, none of the data shows that prices are headed down to where they were before the pandemic, as Biden said. Biden said that ""the cost of an automobile, it's kind of back to what it was before the pandemic."" It’s not back to where it was, or even close. Federal and private-sector data agrees: New and used car prices are on an upward trajectory, smashing records along the way.

Queen Elizabeth did not kidnap 10 children from a Canadian school
","A Facebook post falsely claims that Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip have been found guilty for kidnapping native children. The July 20 post is a rehash of a long-debunked claim: ""After nearly a year of litigation, Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip, were found guilty in the disappearance of 10 native children from the Catholic-run Kamloops residential school in British Columbia. An arrest warrant was issued by six judges of the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels.""  This is not true. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This claim stems from news in May that the remains of over 215 children were discovered near the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia. The Kamloops school was one of many in the Canadian residential school system, and it operated from 1890 to 1978, becoming the largest residential school in Canada with enrollment peaking at 500 in the 1950s.  But there is no evidence that Queen Elizabeth or Prince Philip had anything to do with the discovery — or the school. The earliest claim of abduction that we found was a letter republished by an anonymous community member on the Daily Kos in 2010. In it, a supposed former student named William Arnold Combes alleged that the Queen and Prince Philip both visited the Kamloops Indian Residential School in 1964. According to Combes, the royal couple had a picnic with some of the children there and he ""saw the Queen leave that picnic with ten children from the school, and those children never returned."" But the story has not been substantiated.  There is no evidence that Queen Elizabeth or Prince Philip ever visited the Kamloops Indian Residential School. Queen Elizabeth is the Canadian head of state, so the royal family’s visits to Canada are well documented. British Columbia’s website indicates that the royal couple has only visited the city of Kamloops together once in 1959, and Prince Philip visited the city alone in 1983.  The entity called the ""International Common Law Court of Justice"" is not a legally recognized court. It was created by Kevin Annett, a former Presbyterian minister who in 2018 was denounced by his former church as a conspiracy theorist in a press statement.  In the statement, the United Church of Canada wrote, ""Annett is able to attract attention because he hides behind a single truth: that the Canadian Indian residential school system was abusive, unjust and destructive of indigenous culture."" Furthermore, there is no evidence of the arrest warrant allegedly issued by the six judges in Annett’s ""court."" If the Queen of England were found guilty in court of any crime, it would be international news.  Annett has propagated other conspiracies on his blog site for years, including one that suggested Canada criminalized measures that would prevent the spread of COVID-19 — a claim PolitiFact rated False.  Annett’s site also alleges that a whistleblower alerted the media of the remains of the children at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, even though the Tk’emlups te Secwépemc First Nation revealed the findings in a press release. Residential schools in Canada were established by the Canadian government in the 1880s to forcefully assimilate Indigenous children into Canadian culture. They are now understood to have been places where children were subjected to abuse premised on what was termed ""cultural genocide"" in a 2015 report by Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission.   ​​""Not every school had violence, but every school had the purpose of exterminating the culture of [Indigenous] children, and in some cases the life of those children,"" said Dr. Niigaan Sinclair, a professor in Native Studies at the University of Manitoba. ""The entire system itself is an assimilatory system based on violence.""  A Facebook post claimed that Queen Elizabeth and her husband Prince Philip were found guilty in the disappearance of ten native children from the Kamloops Indian Residential School. There is no evidence that Queen Elizabeth or Prince Philip had ever visited the residential school. There is no trace of the alleged arrest warrant. And the court that allegedly issued this warrant is not a legally recognized court, but the creation of a conspiracy theorist.

No, it doesn’t take divine intervention for a brick wall to collapse
","A mural of George Floyd — painted on the exterior brick wall of a building in Toledo, Ohio— crumbled on July 13, likely after the building was hit by a bolt of lightning.  The mural was designed last summer amid the Black Lives Matter protests following George Floyd’s death. The outer layer of brick wall came down, but the rest of the building remains intact.  In response, Donald Trump Jr. took to social media to speculate that the hand of God was involved in the mural’s ruin, saying in a widely circulated reaction video that ""brick walls are not good conductors of electricity"" and would not ""blow out usually."" In his career as a building developer, he said, he had ""never heard of a brick wall getting blown out by lightning."" The three and a half minute video shows Trump suggesting that, by reducing the mural to rubble, a ""higher power"" may have been conveying a message to ""not worship false prophets"" and heroize George Floyd. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We’re not in a position to weigh in on the intentions of the divine. But the notion that bricks cannot be naturally damaged by lightning is wrong. Toledo’s Fire and Rescue Department is attributing the cause of the collapse to a lightning strike, based on witness reports and evidence gathered from the scene. There was a severe storm in the area around the time of the collapse, and a local station’s Doppler radar also indicated that lightning struck the block that afternoon. Lightning is an electrical discharge that causes the air around it to heat and expand very quickly. Even though bricks are not electrically conductive — as Trump explained in his video — they can still be vulnerable to damage from lightning.  Martin Uman, an expert in lightning phenomena at the University of Florida, speculated that ""any number of things"" could make the brick wall collapse, including the vibration caused by thunder.  He explained that lightning does more damage to insulators — like brick — than to conductors, if lightning current is able to vaporize some of the insulating material, causing high pressure. The shock waves generated by a lightning bolt could cause mortar to break apart, dislodging or disintegrating bricks and causing a structure to collapse.  Other factors may also have contributed to or caused the mural’s destruction, officials said. A city building inspector said that the wall had already been deteriorating prior to the collapse due to the building’s age. Other inspectors had found that the middle section of the wall had been bowing even before the section’s collapse. The mural’s artist has suggested that vandals may have intentionally destroyed the George Floyd memorial, though this account is unconfirmed.  Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz told reporters that the cause of the mural’s destruction is uncertain. ""It could have been an act of nature, or it could have been an act of vandalism,"" Kapszukiewicz said. Trump claimed that  ""brick walls are not good conductors of electricity"" and would not ""blow out usually."" However, we don’t know for certain whether lightning caused the mural to collapse. It’s possible the outer wall of the building was already unstable, or that vandals tore the Floyd memorial down.  If lightning did strike, it’s within reason to suppose that the shock caused the brick wall to crumble.  In either case, a supernatural or divine phenomenon did not have to bring the mural down.  We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/jul/23/donald-trump-jr/no-it-doesnt-take-divine-intervention-brick-wall-c/

Coca-Cola’s stock didn’t tank from a race-related boycott
","After Coca-Cola’s market value dropped $4 billion in mid-June, one Facebook post claimed that the loss was due to a boycott against the company in response to news that its employee diversity training included a message telling people to  ""try to be less white.""  ""Coca-Cola has lost $4 bil in market value as people are boycotting Coke for their ‘try to be less White’ statement,"" the post reads.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In late February, a whistleblower shared images of a diversity and inclusion training course for Coca-Cola’s employees, accessible via LinkedIn, which included a module encouraging people to ""try to be less white."" The company has since removed links to that content, but not before doctored images of the phrase emblazoned on Coke cans were widely shared online.  As a result of the ""try to be less white"" training module, calls to boycott the company circulated on social media under hashtags like #boycottcoke and #boycottcocacola.  But there’s no clear evidence that calls to boycott Coke in February triggered market pressure months later.  Stephen Foerster, a professor of finance at the University of Western Ontario, explained that it’s generally difficult to prove causation related to stock price movements.  ""Stock prices are driven by all kinds of information, some which may impact the overall market, like economic news, and some that is specific to a particular firm,"" Foerster said.  Foerster suggested that it’s possible that the ""try to be less white"" training module may have had a short-term impact on Coke’s stock price relative to the overall market around the time the news circulated in February, but not a long-term impact. Still, some news outlets, from Fortune Magazine to the Washington Post,  have reported that the real cause of the $4 billion market value drop was a viral clip of soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo reaching for water instead of Coke at a press conference for the European Football Championship. In the June 14 clip, the Portuguese soccer star moves two bottles of Coke to the side and says the Portuguese word for water while raising a bottle to the press.  While the S&P 500 rose 0.4% that day, Coca-Cola's shares dropped 1.6%, from $56.17 at the beginning of the conference to $55.22 by the end of the conference, resulting in an overall loss of $4 billion.  Despite the apparent simultaneity between Coca-Cola’s tumble and Ronaldo’s press conference, Coca-Cola’s Chief Financial Officer John Murphy told Reuters in July that the beverage company has not seen any direct sales impact following Ronaldo’s snub.  ""Coca-Cola has lost $4 bil in market value as people are boycotting Coke for their ‘try to be less White’ statement,"" the Facebook post reads.  While Coca-Cola stoked controversy in February for a diversity and equity employee training module which included the phrase, ""try to be less white,"" there’s no evidence that the statement led to product boycotts that affected the company’s market value in mid-June.  We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/jul/23/facebook-posts/coca-colas-stock-didnt-tank-race-related-boycott/

No proof military is moving equipment into cities due to Maricopa audit
","A partisan review of ballots in Maricopa County, Ariz., has fueled repeated speculation on social media that the military is on hand for the release of results, but there’s no evidence of this.

The 12-minute video makes a string of unsubstantiated claims about martial law being in force, Donald Trump being reinstated as president and former government officials being arrested or executed, but the part we looked at was a claim at the beginning of the video about the military being readied in connection with Maricopa County’s audit results.  It’s similar to a post we fact-checked in June that said ""Military ready to act on audit results!"" We rated that one False. The segment in the video about Maricopa included two images of military personnel, both of which were unrelated to the review of ballots in Arizona.

With encouragement from President Donald Trump and his allies, Arizona Senate Republicans launched a review of the ballots cast during the presidential election in Maricopa County. The review started in April and is continuing. Election experts, including Republicans, have criticized the ballot review as partisan and amateurish and said it doesn’t follow typical auditing standards. We have debunked multiple falsehoods stemming from the ballot review including Trump’s claim that  ""74,243 mail-in ballots were counted with 'no clear record of them being sent.'""

Sanders spins the facts when he says campaign did not 'go out and take' Clinton data
","It might feel like pure inside baseball, but the data breach that gave the Bernie Sanders campaign staff access to some of the Hillary Clinton campaign’s voter information goes to the heart of modern elections. At stake are the details that tell a campaign who is persuadable to the cause, and who’s likely to actually come out and vote. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., apologized to the Democratic primary leader Hillary Clinton at a weekend debate in New Hampshire. Clinton accepted his apology and said it was time to move on.   But in an interview the next day on NBC’s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd pressed Sanders on exactly what happened when a software glitch allowed his people to see some of the Clinton data. The system is run by the Democratic National Committee, and the DNC had temporarily blocked the Sanders campaign from using its valuable voter information. ""As a result of a breach caused by the DNC vendor, not by us, information came into our campaign about the Clinton campaign,"" Sanders said Dec. 20, 2015. ""Magically,"" asked Todd? ""We didn't go out and take it,"" Sanders replied. Really? In this fact-check, we’ll explore whether the Sanders campaign staff didn’t ""go out and take"" information from the Clinton campaign. A quick recap On Wednesday, Dec. 16, 2015, NGP VAN, the vendor that operates the system, released a software modification that had a bug. According to a lawsuit filed by the Sanders campaign, ""several staff members of the campaign accessed and viewed confidential Information"" that belonged to the Clinton campaign. The breach was reported within the Sanders campaign the same day. The staffer who had dug into the Clinton files, Josh Uretsky, told CNN that he had poked around in the system to document the extent of the software bug. By Wednesday, the DNC knew of the problem and contacted the Sanders campaign. Senior staff fired Uretsky at some point on Thursday. The DNC blocked the campaign from using the voter system pending an investigation. The Sanders campaign sued on Friday, and by Friday evening, access was restored. On Saturday, the Sanders campaign suspended two other staff members. Steps and missteps No one questions that a software error created the opportunity for the Sanders staffers to see what they shouldn’t. The press release from NGP VAN plainly says that. So then the question is, what did the Sanders campaign staff do? Thanks to a leak of the activity logs on the NGP VAN system, we have some idea. The Twitter user Iowa Starting Line posted them and you can see those logs here. No one has questioned their authenticity. Here’s one example:  These logs show Sanders people spent a bit under two hours in the data. During that time, they called up information from about a dozen states. They queried the database for the number of voters who met certain criteria. The ""Turnout"" variable shows on a scale of 1 to 100 how likely a person is to vote. A voter with a high ""Priority"" score would be someone the campaign will make every effort to contact. The NGP VAN statement said the Sanders campaign could not see actual lists of voters. All that would be visible would be tallies of people. The sole exception was ""a one page-style report containing summary data on a list was saved out of VoteBuilder by one Sanders user."" That would correspond to the final item on the log above where at 11:41 a.m. there is a notation for ""Hits counts and cross tabs 4 times."" It is unclear if that page was printed out or copied. But it was created because a Sanders staff member took specific actions. Two people who know the NGP VAN system told PolitiFact that even the most minimal data gleaned from the Clinton campaign would have been valuable. David Atkins, a campaign consultant and county official in the California Democratic Party, told us that the information would give the Sanders campaign some idea of how the Clinton campaign was targeting voters. And it would offer ""a sort of polling snapshot to see how well or poorly she was doing in certain states."" Daniel Kreiss teaches at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and is the author of Taking our Country Back, which looks at Democratic online campaigning. ""At the very least, topline numbers would provide a ballpark overview of the numbers the opposing campaign was working with in these states,"" Kreiss said. Not only could that open a window into the state of the race, it could help the Sanders campaign measure the accuracy of its own information. Atkins cautioned that to this day, only a handful of people actually know what took place. But the activity logs don’t help the Sanders campaign’s position. ""What appears damning is that hours passed where they didn't contact the vendor immediately, which is what I -- and most campaign operatives -- would have done,"" Atkins said. We reached out to the Sanders campaign for comment and did not hear back. Our ruling Sanders said that his campaign did not go out and take information from the Clinton campaign. From all accounts, it is true that the Sanders campaign did not attempt to break into the voter data of a rival campaign. The Sanders people stumbled upon a glitch. But rather than reporting the glitch immediately, they probed the database for a bit under two hours. At some point, the staff produced a page of information that at the very least would show the count of certain voters. Experts familiar with the Democratic voter data base say that the Sanders campaign would have gleaned valuable information. At the end of the day, they knew some things about the Clinton campaign that they hadn’t known before, even if they didn’t seek to crack into the Clinton data. We rate Sanders’ claim that the campaign didn’t ""go out and take"" information as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/dec/22/bernie-sanders/Sanders-take-Clinton-voter-data/

Ted Cruz overstates effect of proposed constitutional amendment
","During a speech to a conservative crowd in Iowa this month, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz leveled a heavy charge against his colleagues across the aisle in the U.S. Senate. Democrats, he said, attempted to eliminate Americans’ right to free speech with a proposed constitutional amendment last fall. ""The Democrats in the Senate last year introduced a constitutional amendment to repeal the free speech protections of the First Amendment,"" Cruz told the audience at the Rising Tide Summit in Cedar Rapids. Striking one of America’s most cherished and fundamental rights would certainly represent a controversial and historic change to the U.S. Constitution. But is that what Senate Democrats actually attempted to do? Cruz was referring to Senate Joint Resolution 19, a proposed amendment regarding campaign finance that Democrats pursued in the months leading up to the 2014 midterm elections. The measure failed to clear a procedural hurdle in September 2014 and faced a long road to ratification even if it had advanced. As a constitutional amendment, it would’ve had to pass with two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate and then win approval from three-fourths of state legislatures across the country. The amendment The text of the proposed amendment itself is pretty short and relatively straightforward. Here it is: SECTION 1.To advance democratic self-government and political equality, and to protect the integrity of government and the electoral process, Congress and the States may regulate and set reasonable limits on the raising and spending of money by candidates and others to influence elections. SECTION 2.Congress and the States shall have power to implement and enforce this article by appropriate legislation, and may distinguish between natural persons and corporations or other artificial entities created by law, including by prohibiting such entities from spending money to influence elections. SECTION 3. Nothing in this article shall be construed to grant Congress or the States the power to abridge the freedom of the press. Supporters say the measure is meant to overturn Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, a pair of Supreme Court decisions that have sharply weakened existing federal campaign finance laws. It would do this by explicitly allowing Congress and the states to regulate and limit campaign fundraising and spending and to distinguish between ""natural persons"" and legal entities like corporations when regulating campaign spending. The text of the amendment makes no reference to freedom of speech or the First Amendment. So how does it represent an attack on free speech? The Cruz campaign referred us to a July 2014 op-ed Cruz wrote in the Washington Times. In it, the senator argues that political speech published or distributed by a corporation -- like an editorial from the New York Times or a skit on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" -- could be limited or banned by an act of Congress if the amendment were ratified. In a previous fact check, we found a similar Cruz statement about jailing Lorne Michaels to be half-true. U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, offered a similar critique as the measure was being debated last September. ""The proposed amendment would restrict the most important speech the First Amendment protects, core political speech,"" Politico quoted Grassley saying in a Sept. 11, 2014, story. ""It’s hard to imagine what would be more radical than the Congress passing a constitutional amendment to overturn a dozen Supreme Court decisions that have protected individual rights. Free speech would be dramatically curtailed."" But what do the experts say? We checked in with a range of constitutional law scholars — including Cruz’s old con-law prof at Harvard — who offered a range of views and interpretations. But while there is some scholarly disagreement on whether the proposed amendment threatens free speech, none of those surveyed shared Cruz’s assertion that it would amount to outright repeal of free speech rights. Several said Cruz has a point, but that he oversells it when he uses the term ""repeal"" with no caveats or qualifiers. ""There is no question it would be a partial repeal of the First Amendment as it has been interpreted by the Supreme Court since at least 1976,"" said Stanford Constitutional Law Center Director Michael W. McConnell. ""Of course, some justices and academics disagree with many of the holdings of the court with respect to campaign finance, but this proposal would cut more deeply into First Amendment protections even than those dissenting justices have voted to permit."" University of Pennsylvania Law School Professor Kermit Roosevelt also described the proposed amendment as a ""partial repeal"" of constitutional speech protections. ""What Cruz says is mostly accurate, with a couple of caveats,"" Roosevelt said. ""Cruz could have been more clear if he’d specified that the proposed repeal was aimed at undoing the Supreme Court’s decisions thwarting campaign finance reform, not at speech more generally. And I think he failed to do so deliberately, because those decisions are not very popular, while free speech in general is."" In his Washington Times op-ed, Cruz noted criticism of the proposed amendment from famed constitutional lawyer and First Amendment litigator Floyd Abrams. In remarks during a Senate hearing on the measure, Abrams argued that it ""would limit speech that is at the heart of the First Amendment"" and do so ""in a sweepingly broad manner."" Several prominent scholars, meanwhile, say Cruz is flat-out wrong. ""I have read the amendment carefully. It’s about raising and spending money in political campaigns — nothing more,"" Harvard Law School constitutional law Professor Laurence H. Tribe told us in an email. ""It has no effect at all on freedom of the press, freedom of assembly or peaceful protest. It does not allow the government to punish people for speaking their minds."" Tribe also noted that he had Cruz, a Harvard Law graduate, in class. ""Ted Cruz earned an A in my constitutional law course at Harvard, and I am a tough grader!"" Tribe said. ""I’m confident Ted knows his statement is false. No lawyer or student who can read English believes what Ted Cruz claimed to believe."" The main sticking point for scholars is whether spending money is a constitutionally protected expression of free speech. That notion undergirds the recent Supreme Court decisions throwing out campaign finance regulations, experts said, but is far from a consensus view in legal circles or even on the court itself. ""Citizens United recently overturned many decades of First Amendment jurisprudence that allowed law to distinguish corporate from individual speech when it comes to campaign finance regulations,"" Yale Law School Dean Robert C. Post told us in an email. ""For the most part, the Court has only recently imposed strict constitutional limits on campaign finance regulations. Ted Cruz is referring in his comment to very recent and controversial interpretations of the First Amendment."" Richard L. Hasen, a law professor and expert on elections law at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law, offered a similar assessment. ""This is a controversial theory of the First Amendment, and some dissenting justices do not agree that these limits on elections violate the free speech or other First Amendment protections,"" Hasen said. ""If the amendment passed,"" he added, ""it does not seem likely it would have a direct effect on the Supreme Court's free speech decisions in areas other than those related to campaign financing."" Andrew Koppelman, a professor of law and political science at Northwestern University, called Cruz’s statement ""misleading."" ""The Court was deeply split in Citizens United,"" Koppelman said. ""The bill proposes to amend the Constitution so that the four dissenters prevail. If, as the dissenters thought, Citizens United misinterprets the First Amendment, then the proposal restores the Amendment rather than repealing it. Cruz seems to think that Citizens United is an obviously correct interpretation of the Amendment, but if that were true, why was the Court divided 5-4?"" Pepperdine School of Law constitutional law professor Douglas W. Kmiec dismissed Cruz’s assertion even more succinctly. ""There is nothing in our history to suggest that the founders equated speech and money,"" Kmiec said. ""That being so, there is no constitutional violation of freedom of speech to propose the amendment."" Our Ruling Cruz told his audience that Senate Democrats proposed a constitutional amendment that would ""repeal"" constitutionally guaranteed free speech rights. The proposal actually allows state and federal legislators to regulate fundraising and spending in elections. Campaign finance has been linked to free speech in recent jurisprudence, but a wide range of constitutional law scholars say the amendment would have a limited or nonexistent effect on speech rights. Several scholars said Cruz has a point, but he oversells it by using ""repeal"" with no caveats or qualifiers. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/dec/22/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-overstates-effect-proposed-constitutional/

Hillary Clinton says Bernie Sanders voted for regime change in Libya
","Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton got into a tussle over their differing foreign policy visions at the Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire. Sanders criticized Clinton for being too hawkish in the Middle East. ""I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be,"" he said Dec. 19. ""Yes, we could get rid of (former Iraqi leader) Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region. Yes, we could get rid of (former Libyan dictator Muammar) Gaddafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS. Yes, we could get rid of (Syrian dictator Bashar) Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS. So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy. But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after."" Clinton shot back, ""With all due respect, senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya. You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gaddafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution."" We wondered if Clinton was right -- that Sanders previously wanted the Libyan leader gone, even though he now views Gaddafi’s ousting as a cautionary tale. The vote The U.S. military spent about $2 billion and several months backing the Libyan uprising against Gaddafi, who had held power for decades. The uprising -- part of the Arab Spring -- toppled Gaddafi in August 2011, and rebel forces killed him the following October. Congress never voted to authorize U.S. military action in Libya, so what is Clinton talking about? On March 1, 2011, the Senate approved a resolution ""strongly condemning the gross and systematic violations of human rights in Libya."" The Senate approved the resolution by unanimous consent, so senators never actually voted on it. But Sanders showed his support by joining in as one of 10 cosponsors. The resolution called for peaceful regime change, saying Gaddafi should ""desist from further violence, recognize the Libyan people’s demand for democratic change, resign his position and permit a peaceful transition to democracy."" A Senate resolution carries very little weight. It has no legal teeth and is more like a statement expressing the general ""sense of Congress,"" said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. ""In effect, all this resolution does is say, ‘Gaddafi is a bad person and should stop,’ "" Huder said, noting that this document cannot be interpreted as expression of congressional intent to take specific action to oust Gaddafi. Sanders’ campaign said Clinton was misrepresenting his record because the Senate resolution was nonbinding and not a show of support for U.S. military action. In a March 28, 2011, interview, Sanders described his position toward regime change in Libya. He wanted Gaddafi gone, but not at all costs. ""Look, everybody understands Gaddafi is a thug and murderer,"" Sanders said to Fox News. ""We want to see him go, but I think in the midst of two wars (in Iraq and Afghanistan), I'm not quite sure we need a third war, and I hope the president tells us that our troops will be leaving there, that our military action in Libya will be ending very, very shortly."" Clinton also said Sanders’ vote signaled support for United Nations action to get rid of Gaddafi. The Senate resolution asked ""the United Nations Security Council to take such further action as may be necessary to protect civilians in Libya from attack, including the possible imposition of a no-fly zone over Libyan territory."" The two related U.N. resolutions -- 1970 and 1973 -- called for drastic measures to pressure Gaddafi to stop his alleged human rights abuses, including establishing a no-fly zone and imposing an asset freeze on members of the regime. Neither resolution explicitly call for regime change, though. But Clinton as secretary of state and leaders from other countries did use the two U.N. resolutions as a platform to take actions that they hoped would pressure Gaddafi to step down and allow a transition to democracy. ""While our military mission is focused on saving lives, we must continue to pursue the broader goal of a Libya that belongs not to a dictator, but to the Libyan people,"" Clinton said at the International Conference on Libya March 29, 2011. Our ruling Clinton said Sanders ""voted for regime change with respect to Libya.""  The reality is a bit more complicated than the sound bite. Sanders supported a non-binding Senate resolution that called on Gaddafi to resign his post in a peaceful, democratic transition of power. While the Senate passed the resolution by unanimous consent -- meaning no one actually voted on it -- Sanders was one of 10 cosponsors. At the time, Sanders told the media he wanted Gaddafi out of power, but it might not be worth it if it required sustained U.S. military involvement.

Marco Rubio says Ted Cruz voted for defense cuts in Rand Paul's budget proposal
","Marco Rubio portrayed fellow GOP senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as all talk and no action on defense in an interview on Meet the Press. ""He talks tough on some of these issues,"" Rubio said Dec. 13. ""For example, he was going to ‘carpet bomb’ ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it."" Rubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians, who typically favor less defense spending. We decided to fact-check Rubio’s claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president. Cruz’s vote on Rand Paul’s budget proposal Rubio’s campaign pointed to Cruz’s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul’s amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed. Paul’s 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade. Rubio’s campaign pointed to Paul’s statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending: ""This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,"" Paul wrote. ""It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment."" Under Paul’s proposal, defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels. Was Paul’s proposal a ‘cut’ for defense? So why did Rubio refer to Paul’s budget as a ""cut"" if defense spending would rise? ""We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,"" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said. But experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul’s proposal a ""cut."" ""Paul’s defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president’s budget was an even larger increase),"" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But Paul’s defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut."" Paul’s 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama’s request both at the time and now, Harrison said. Christopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul’s budget a ""cut."" ""As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,"" he said. ""This is misleading."" Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument. ""So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a ‘cut’ when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,"" Phillips said. ""The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase."" Benjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruz’s vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul’s amendment which would have boosted it with offsets. ""This was a budget, so it doesn’t make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,"" Friedman said. Our ruling Rubio said that the only budget Cruz ""ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it."" Rubio was referring to Cruz’s vote in favor of Paul’s budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul’s plan when he called it a ""cut."" That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth. However, there is a kernel of truth here in that Paul’s proposal for defense was below Obama’s request.

Rob Wittman mostly right about the few nations 'truly' fighting ISIS
","Although dozens of nations have pledged to fight the Islamic State, few actually have joined the U.S. in taking military steps against the group, says U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-1st. During a recent interview on C-SPAN, Wittman said the U.S. could use some help in the air campaign against the Islamic State. ""Of the 65 coalition partners, only nine are truly actively involved in these efforts,"" he said. ""This will not be successful if we don’t have those coalition partners involved."" We wondered if Wittman is correct that only nine nations have joined the U.S. in taking military action against the Islamic State. Farahn Morgan, Wittman’s spokeswoman, said the congressman got the figure from a Nov. 30 article in The Washington Times. Morgan pointed to a comment in the article from Anthony Cordesman, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who criticized the White House approach to the air campaign and said, ""This is a ‘65-country coalition’ of which only about nine are doing something."" The U.S. State Department does indeed count 65 countries as members of a broad coalition aimed at eliminating the Islamic State threat. The department says those nations are participating in different ways: providing military support, stopping the Islamic State’s financing, impeding the flow of foreign fighters into the area, dealing with humanitarian crises, and exposing the ""true nature"" of the militant group. A Nov. 18 report from the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan fact-finding arm of Congress, offers examples of non-military contributions. They include Switzerland’s $9 million of aid to Iraq -- where the Islamic State is present -- and Japan’s $6 million of aid to help refugees in northern Iraq. The military component of the coalition is Operation Inherent Resolve, and 22 nations have pledged to take part in it, according to CRS. About two-thirds of those countries have provided military personnel to help train local forces to battle the Islamic State.  A smaller group of a dozen countries have provided aircraft to take part in airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq since the military campaign started in August 2014, according to the Department of Defense. Those countries are Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. As of Dec. 9, the U.S.-led coalition had conducted 8,783 airstrikes, according to the Pentagon. The U.S. conducted 6,846 of those attacks, or about four-fifths of them. It’s difficult to get an exact read on the current number of allies still active in the campaign for a couple of reasons. Participation in the military campaign ebbs and flows depending on each nation’s interests, the Congressional Research Service noted in its report. For example, Belgium stopped its airstrikes at the end of June due to budget constraints. Incoming Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in October that his government would withdraw its combat aircraft, but it’s unclear if that has happened yet, the research service said. Airwars.org, a non-profit that tracks the air war in Iraq and Syria, reported in October that Denmark recalled the seven F-16s it used against the Islamic State, although they may return. The New York Times reported on Nov. 7 that some Arab countries in the coalition, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have shifted most of their aircraft away battling the Islamic State and instead focused them on the fight against a rebel uprising in Yemen. Allied officials told the newspaper that the United Arab Emirates hadn’t carried out strikes in Syria since March and Jordan hadn’t done so since August. Qatar flies patrols over Syria, but ""its role has been modest,"" The Times said. Wittman hardly is the first to complain the U.S. isn’t getting enough coalition support in battling the Islamic State. Our colleagues at PolitiFact National recently examined a similar claim by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and rated it Mostly True.   David Weinberg, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, told PolitiFact that of the dozen allies the Pentagon says actually have conducted airstrikes, ""some of those are only symbolic or largely out of date."" Weinberg said the countries with the best case for taking a ""serious"" role in the air campaign, outside of the U.S., are France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Australia. Chris Woods, the director of Airwars.org, said some coalition members are providing auxiliary assistance to the campaign even if they are not taking part in airstrikes. Italy, for example, provides aircraft for in-air refueling, and Germany has said it will provide six Tornado fighter jets for aerial reconnaissance. Michael O’Hanlon, co-director of the Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence at the Brookings Institution, told us that the figure Wittman uses to tally the number of allies taking part in military action against the Islamic State sounds correct. ""I don’t have concrete data, but I’d say that the number nine is roughly correct if one is talking about military action,"" O’Hanlon wrote in an email. Our ruling Wittman, in arguing the U.S. isn’t getting enough help in the heavy lifting against the Islamic State, said just nine of our international coalition partners are ""truly actively involved"" in military efforts against the militant group. The figure is credible based on government data and media reports. Thirteen nations have taken part in airstrikes against the group during the past year, according to the Pentagon. There are indications that perhaps half of the countries have suspended their roles against the Islamic State, although they may resume in the future. The lack of transparency from some coalition governments makes it impossible define a precise number at any given time. Also, we should note that some countries are contributing to the military campaign in ways other than airstrikes - such as providing aircraft for refueling, reconnaissance and military personnel to train local forces. With those clarifications, we rate Wittman’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/dec/22/rob-wittman/rob-wittman-mostly-right-about-few-nations-fightin/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Military', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie mostly wrong that Barack Obama invited Russia into military role in Syria
","The multi-sided conflict in Syria had already been bedeviling policymakers and diplomats for years by the time Russia began launching airstrikes there on Sept. 30, 2015. But did the United States ""invite"" Russia to pursue this sudden escalation? That’s what New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said during the Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas. ""I'll tell you what reckless is,"" Christie said during the debate on Dec. 15, 2015. ""What’s reckless is is calling Assad a reformer. What reckless is allowing Russia to come into Crimea and Ukraine. What reckless is is inviting Russia into Syria to team with Iran. That is reckless. And the reckless people are the folks in the White House right now. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are the reckless people."" This statement includes a lot of charges by Christie. But for this fact-check, we’ll zero in on Christie’s claim that the Obama administration invited Russia into Syria. Russia’s airstrikes The situation in Syria is complex, but we’ll start by trying to offer a concise summary. Syrian rebels -- some considered moderates, some considered extremists -- have been trying for several years to topple Bashar Assad whose family has run the country in authoritarian fashion for decades. The chaos has contributed to the rise of ISIS, which has effectively seized control of portions of Syria, including Raqqa, the city ISIS is using as its ""capital."" Most of the world has no love for the Assad government, but Syria has long relied on two countries for support -- Iran and Russia. Russia’s ties to Syria include a leased naval base, which is Russia’s only Mediterranean port and thus a crucial geopolitical asset. Russia has generally supported Assad, but until recently, Russia’s military role in Syria had been fairly low-profile. By contrast, since the ISIS threat became clear, the United States -- along with a coalition of more than 60 countries -- has been taking an active military role in Syria. For the United States and a few other allies, that has meant launching airstrikes against ISIS targets. The longstanding U.S. position regarding Russia and Syria has been to convince Russia to forgo its support for Assad. For instance, in a Sept. 11, 2015, town hall at Ft. Meade in Maryland -- about two and a half weeks before Russian airstrikes began -- Obama took note of Russia’s efforts to send military advisers and equipment to Syria. ""That won't change our core strategy, which is to continue to put pressure on ISIL in Iraq and Syria, but we are going to be engaging Russia to let them know that you can't continue to double-down on a strategy that’s doomed to failure,"" Obama said. ""And if they are willing to work with us and the 60-nation coalition that we've put together, then there’s the possibility of a political settlement in which Assad would be transitioned out and a new coalition of moderate, secular and inclusive forces could come together and restore order in the country."" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest echoed that in a press briefing on Sept. 24, less than a week before Russia began its airstrikes. Earnest was asked by a reporter, ""Where do we stand in terms of possible U.S.-Russian military cooperation on Syria?"" Earnest responded, ""President Obama will make clear once again that Russia doubling down on their support for the Assad regime is a losing bet. The likely consequence of them doing so is only to deepen and expand the ongoing crisis in that country that doesn’t serve the interests of either the Russian people or the American people. President Obama will encourage President Putin to consider constructive contributions to the ongoing counter-(ISIS) effort. There are more than 60 nations that are involved in implementing a strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, and we’d like to see the Russians make a constructive contribution to that ongoing effort."" If you squint, it’s possible to see an ""invitation"" for Russian military intervention in Earnest’s comment. However, the administration has couched this ""invitation"" in diplomatic terms, focusing on a broad effort to promote a peaceful end to the crisis rather than a desire for Russia to start bombing away. Moreover, the immediate aftermath of the first airstrikes suggests that the administration was not happy -- at all -- to learn about the escalation to airstrikes ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Shortly after the airstrikes became public, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter called Russia’s move tantamount ""to pouring gasoline on the fire."" The same day, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work told members of the House Armed Services Committee that the United States was ""alarmed"" by the beginning of Russian airstrikes. He called it ""an aggressive action by Russia."" Immediately after the Russian airstrikes began, Earnest said the United States was continuing to encourage ""constructive"" moves by Russia but expressed skepticism about its recent military actions. ""If Russia is willing, we would welcome their constructive contribution to this effort,"" Earnest said in his Sept. 30 briefing. ""The fact that they have not decided to make a constructive contribution to our counter-(ISIS) effort means that Russia is not doing exactly what we would like them to do in Syria, and that’s not unusual in the relationship between our two countries. … Obviously, we would like to see Russia do something different. I’m not trying to suggest to you that this is what we would like to see Russia do."" What the experts say When we checked with diplomatic and regional experts, they generally agreed with the White House that Christie’s words -- if taken literally -- were inaccurate. ""Russia decided to intervene in Syria on its own. There was no U.S. invitation,"" said Barnett R. Rubin, director and senior fellow at New York University’s Center on International Cooperation. ""No, Obama did not invite Russia into Syria. Just wrong,"" said Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, agreed. ""It isn't true,"" Landis said. ""The United states tried to oppose Russia moving aircraft and weaponry into Syria. The U.S. government convinced Greece and other countries to close its airspace to Russian planes. Russia flew over Iran and Iraq, which allowed the Russian resupply planes to overfly them. The U.S. could have attacked the Russian planes and ships and did not. I presume Chris Christie is confusing that with an invitation."" The Christie campaign doesn’t contest the idea that Christie’s claim isn’t literally true. Instead, the campaign argues that the administration’s fault was one of omission rather than commission. ""The governor was suggesting that the president's actions or lack thereof invited Putin to fill the vacuum left by a lack of leadership, not that he sent a written invitation,"" said Mike DuHaime, a senior strategist with the Christie campaign. At least one expert said DuHaime’s argument has some validity. ""I don’t think Christie meant it to be taken literally,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""Obviously we did not invite Russia in. But what I think he’s very clearly referring to is a weakness that led to Russia coming in. The fact that the administration has had an awful Syria policy has moved beyond a matter of opinion."" The Christie campaign also pointed us to a comment Christie made to CNN’s Jake Tapper on Oct. 8 in which he explains that by the ""invitation"" he means the cooperation between the United States and Russia on removing chemical weapons from Syria in 2013. Obama ""invited Putin in to broker an agreement with Assad to give up his chemical weapons, which Assad has not done,"" Christie told Tapper. ""Once you invite Putin in for that part of it, you can't then pick and choose given the Obama approach what you do. So he did invite him in, Jake. And it was wrong."" Our ruling Christie said the Obama administration ""invit(ed) Russia into Syria."" We found wide agreement that the statement, if taken literally, is inaccurate. However, another interpretation -- that the Obama administration’s policy failures created a vacuum that Putin filled militarily -- has some validity, experts say.

"['State Budget', 'Virginia', 'Terry McAuliffe']","
McAuliffe's 'misspoken' claim about facing record deficit
","It’s a set part of Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s spiel to talk about how he ""inherited a $2.4 billion deficit"" when he took office in January 2014 and managed, with the bipartisan help of legislators, to balance the state budget. In a recent PolitiFact, we checked McAuliffe’s claim that the shortfall was left behind by his predecessor, Republican Bob McDonnell. We noted that McDonnell proposed a balanced budget before leaving office and records show that the brunt of the economic slowdown that caused the shortfall, although not McAuliffe’s fault, occurred during his watch. We rated that claim Mostly False. The governor added a new element to the claim on Dec. 10 during his monthly radio show on WRVA in Richmond. ""I came in with a record deficit I inherited,"" said McAuliffe, a Democrat. Without rehashing details of the ""inherited"" part of his statement, we decided to examine McAuliffe’s claim that the $2.4 billion shortfall he confronted was ""a record deficit"" for Virginia. Records show the state faced a far greater crisis at the start of 2010, when McDonnell was succeeding Democrat Tim Kaine as governor and Virginia began suffering the full effects of the Great Recession. Two reports by the General Assembly’s budget committees at that time identified a shortfall of almost $4.5 billion for the two-year budget that would begin July 1, 2010. Brian Coy, McAuliffe’s director of communications, told us the governor ""misspoke"" in claiming he faced a deficit record. The reason for the mistake requires a little explanation. McAuliffe, as we noted in a Nov. 16 fact check, typically follows his claim about inheriting a $2.4 billion deficit with the kicker that he and lawmakers adroitly turned the problem ""into a record surplus."" He offered the same kicker on WRVA, noting that the so-called ""record deficit"" is ""now a record surplus."" Coy said McAuliffe inadvertently used the adjective ""record"" to describe both budget developments instead of just the surplus. ""When you talk to the public all day, sometimes you have a slip of the tongue,"" Coy said. We know of no other instance where the governor made a similar claim about the shortfall. The record surplus stems from McAuliffe’s announcement in July 2015 that Virginia ended the first year of its biennial budget $550 million in the black. That slightly outstrips the previous surplus high of $545 million for the budget year ending in mid-2005, according to records going back to 1990. But it should be added that when adjusted for inflation, the 2005 surplus still is the highest. Some people seeing all these figures might conclude that Virginia’s budget has made an almost $3 billion rebound during the past year -- from a $2.4 billion shortfall in 2014 to a $550 million surplus this year. As we’ve noted before, that’s not the case. McAuliffe and the legislature overestimated the state’s economic problems in August 2014, when they adjusted the two-year budget to a ""pessimistic"" forecast of a $2.4 billion shortfall. That assumption turned out to be $550 million too high and produced the record surplus McAuliffe now cites. Our ruling McAuliffe said the $2.4 billion budget shortfall he and lawmakers resolved last year was ""a record deficit"" for Virginia. When we questioned about the assertion, a spokesman said the governor misspoke. Indeed, the reddest ink in Virginia was seen in 2010, when the state, in the teeth of recession, faced a $4.5 billion shortfall for the coming two-year budget. We don’t suggest the crisis McAuliffe faced was peanuts or question the explanation that he made a simple ""slip of the tongue.""

Numbers cited by Katrina Shankland on layoffs don't tell the story
","Days after Heinz Kraft announced plans to close the Oscar Mayer plant in Madison, an expected  loss of about 1,000 jobs, state Assembly Democrats held a news conference to argue lawmakers should focus on job creation. The news conference came before a session of the state Assembly called by majority Republicans to consider election and campaign finance issues. Democrats said the focus, given the bad news from Oscar Mayer and several other major employers, should be on the economy and jobs. ""We are on pace to double layoffs since 2014,"" declared Assistant Minority Leader Katrina Shankland (D-Stevens Point.) ""This is the governor's worst year of his administration in terms of layoffs,"" she continued. ""We're well over 10,000 layoffs and the people of Wisconsin are crying out for action."" When we asked Shankland’s office for backup, an aide said Shankland was using state Department of Workforce Development data on notices of plant closings and mass layoffs. Shankland aide Annika Petty noted the ""list does not yet include the layoffs announced in early November by Oscar Mayer."" Unpacking the numbers For 2014, the state received layoff warning notices that covered 7,239 jobs. As of Nov. 2, 2015, the tally for this year was 11,057. So if you add in the Oscar Mayer layoff,that would bring it to about 12,050. That’s not quite double, but two months of data remained at the time Shankland made her claim and the numbers from earlier months suggest her claim is generally on target. But the layoff number are nowhere near as solid as Shankland suggests. Here is how the system works: In Wisconsin, businesses are required to file warning notices with the state when they anticipate ending employment for more than 50 workers. Wisconsin’s law is more strict than federal law, which sets the threshold at more than 100 workers. But some layoffs never trigger a notice, because they don’t reach the 50 person threshold. And the notices don’t always mean lost jobs. When a company changes hands, the old firm is required to file a notice, even if all the workers will retain their jobs with the new firm. In some cases, layoffs take place immediately. In other cases -- such as with Oscar Mayer -- the plant closing is expected months later. In still others, they never take place. So the numbers don’t represent actual layoffs. As such, experts say they are a lousy tool for assessing the state’s economy. That’s what we found when we rated a July 2015 claim from the liberal group American Bridge 21st Century, which said Wisconsin’s economy had ""tanked"" under Walker and ""so far in 2015 over 6,685 people have been laid off, already more than in all of 2014."" We rated the claim False. Shankland’s claim is somewhat different, in that she does not directly cite the number as evidence of the state’s economy tanking. But she did make it at a news conference that asserted more action is needed on jobs due to poor economic performance. Experts such as Brian Jacobsen, an economist at Wells Fargo and a professor at Wisconsin Lutheran College, say a far better indicator of the employment picture -- but one that’s not without it’s own flaws -- is the monthly jobs report. Those numbers show that as of October 2015, the state added an estimated 30,300 jobs in 2015. That includes a preliminary estimate of 15,100 private sector jobs added in October alone. The number is preliminary and subject to change. But the important point is this: Those figures are the net result of all changes, including layoffs and jobs added, not just one side of the coin. Our rating Shankland said Wisconsin ""is on pace to double the number of layoffs this year."" She cited layoff notices received by the state. But those aren’t actual layoffs. And while she’s about right on the number of notices received, she’s wrong to suggest that the employment numbers are headed downward this year. In the time frame she cited the state’s added about 30,300 jobs. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2015/dec/21/katrina-shankland/numbers-cited-katrina-shankland-layoffs-dont-tell-/
"['National', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump is right about Putin's popularity in Russia
","Russian President Vladimir Putin recently called Donald Trump ""brilliant"" and ""talented,"" and Trump wears those compliments as a badge of honor. On NBC’s Meet the Press on Dec. 20, host Chuck Todd asked the real estate mogul and Republican presidential front runner why he is so comfortable praising Putin, noting that Trump has called Putin a ""strong leader."" ""He is a strong leader. What am I going to say, he’s a weak leader?"" Trump responded. ""He’s making mincemeat out of our president."" Then Trump turned to his reliable measure of a person’s success: the polls. ""He’s got an 80 percent approval rating done by pollsters from, I understand, this country. Okay?"" Trump said.  ""So it’s not even done by his pollsters. He’s very popular within Russia; that may change."" An 80 percent approval rating is pretty darn high. For comparison, President Barack Obama’s job approval rating is currently about 46 percent and peaked at 64 percent in February 2009, his second month in office, according to Pew Research Center. So we wondered if Trump is correct that American polling shows Putin has such a high rating among the Russian people. In a first for Trump on the Truth-O-Meter thus far, he is. By the numbers A November study written by four American researchers backs up Trump’s point, finding about 80 percent of Russians really support Putin. ""What Trump said is consistent with what we found,"" said Scott Gehlbach, a co-author of the study and a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Given that Putin achieved strikingly high public approval ratings, the study asked whether Putin’s popularity is real or if respondents have been lying to pollsters. A primary concern for the researchers was the possibility of ""social desirability bias,"" the idea that a person who does not support Putin might tell a pollster that they do support him out of fear of retaliation or going against social norms. To correct for this, the researchers used a list experiment, a technique used to broach sensitive issues because it does not require respondents to say explicitly that they do or do not support Putin. Pollsters gave Russian respondents a list of several Russian leaders and asked how many they support, but not which ones. By comparing the difference between a control group, which was presented with a list that did not include Putin, with a group that received a list that did include Putin, the researchers were able to estimate overall support for the Russian president. After conducting four list experiments in January and March of this year, Gehlbach and his co-authors concluded that the high level of support for Putin is real. If anything, their finding of 80 percent support might be an underestimate. Gehlbach noted, though, that the study did not account for how many of the 80 percent are devout supporters versus those whose support is fleeting. Further, it’s likely that the Kremlin manipulates public opinion of Putin through tight control of the media. ""It’s reasonable that some people support Putin because of what they see on the evening news,"" Gehlbach said. This study is evidence that Putin is genuinely popular in Russia, wrote Joshua Tucker, a political science professor at New York University, in a Nov. 24 post on the Washington Post’s Monkey Cage blog. In sum, ""the findings suggest both that the West will likely be dealing with a popular leader when it interacts with Putin in the days to come,"" Tucker wrote. One potential wrinkle in Trump’s claim is that while the American researchers designed the study, a Russian polling company, the Levada Center, actually conducted the survey. But Gehlbach said that doesn’t dilute Trump’s claim because the Levada Center is well-regarded as independent from the Russian government. Karlyn Bowman, a public opinion expert and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, also said the Levada Center is held in high regard and its findings are consistent with related research by the U.S.-based Pew Research Center. This past summer, Pew found 88 percent of Russians ""have confidence in (Putin), to do the right thing regarding world affairs."" Putin’s standing is substantially lower among Americans, with just 21 percent saying they have confidence in him. Gehlbach’s article, which will be published in the journal Post-Soviet Affairs, also mentions how Putin’s high approval ratings are often confirmed by Western researchers’ polls. The study cites an Associated Press-NORC at the University of Chicago poll that found Putin’s approval rating to be about 81 percent in 2014.

Paul Ryan's shaky claim that Obamacare is 'making families pay double-digit premium increases'
","House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., called out President Barack Obama as ""one of the most polarizing presidents we’ve ever had,"" telling NBC’s Chuck Todd that relations between the parties would have been better under 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who made Ryan his running mate ""But you guys are going to try to defund his signature health care law,"" Todd said on the Dec. 20 edition of Meet the Press. ""For many progressives, that's a polarizing move."" ""It's a law that is not working. It's a law that's depriving people's choices,"" Ryan said. ""It's a law that's making families pay double-digit premium increases.""  This sounded similar to a claim we examined in October, when GOP presidential candidate and businessman Donald Trump said the law is causing premiums to go up ""35, 45, 55 percent."" We rated that claim Half True, noting that some may see price hikes at those levels, but the rates suggested by Trump are the high end of premium changes. Ryan is suggesting less dramatic increases in the ""double digits."" We decided to rate that claim on the Truth-O-Meter. We found that Ryan, like Trump, is cherry-picking plans in the marketplace and ignoring the tax credits that are also part of the law. How prices have changed Most people get their insurance through their employer or other government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, not the federal exchange at healthcare.gov. (Single and family premiums for employer-sponsored plans increased an average of 4 percent this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading nonpartisan health policy research center.) In this fact-check, we’ll specifically look at health insurance plans sponsored by Obamacare. Ryan’s office sent us a few links describing how some Obamacare enrollees in some states will see increases of 10 percent or more from this year to next. But hikes in the double digits are not as universal as Ryan suggests, and not entirely attributable to the health care law itself. The Department of Health and Human Services looked at average rate hikes for the benchmark plan in the marketplace, the second-lowest priced silver plan. According to HHS data, 19 out of the 37 states in the federal exchange saw an average rate increase in the double digits. At the low end, rates in Missouri increased by 10.4 percent while Oklahoma saw the biggest hike at 35.7 percent. Conversely, four states actually saw reduced rates, with Indiana’s decrease in the double digits at 12.6 percent. The other 11 states with rate hikes saw smaller increases, from 1.2 to 6.1 percent. Across all silver plans, the average increase is about 11 percent, estimated McKinsey & Company, a management consulting firm. But according to McKinsey, people who will see their lowest cost plans increase at rates above 10 percent are in the minority (28 percent). The national average increase for the benchmark plan, according to HHS, is not in the double digits. It’s 7.5 percent for the 37 states using healthcare.gov. In the 30 largest markets, representing about 60 percent of enrollees, the rate increase is 6.3 percent. ""For most consumers, premium increases for 2016 are in the single digits and they will be able to find plans for less than $100 a month,"" said Kevin Counihan, CEO of healthcare.gov in a news release.   Year-over-year average changes in premiums alone, however, don’t fully capture how changes hit an enrollee’s wallet. To get a sense of the typical rate increase, we have to also consider enrollment figures for each state, as well as tax credits for premiums, which are available to consumers earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty line (less than $97,000 for a family of four). Factoring in these two components, the average rates are significantly reduced and nowhere near double-digit increases. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the weighted average rate for major cities in 49 states and Washington, D.C., grew by 3.6 percent.   After accounting for tax credits, the weighted average actually decreased 0.7 percent. No such thing as typical Ryan missteps by saying the law alone is ""making"" the premiums increase. Rather, experts say, hikes are more likely the result of insurers underestimating how sick enrollees would be. ""Risk pools remain quite volatile, at least in part because of all the special enrollment periods the administration has introduced in their attempts to get as many people as possible to sign up,"" said Gail Wilensky, a health economist and the head of Medicare and Medicaid under George H.W. Bush. ""Stopping that is the first step to bringing stability to the market.""  But both Wilensky and Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Foundation stressed that 2016 is the first year that insurers are looking at actual claims data. Before, they were ""essentially guessing at what their costs were,"" Levitt told PolitiFact in October. ""Some insurers guessed better than others, which leads to variations in premium changes."" Experts also stress that premiums vary too much to be captured by averages. Enrollment figures also differ from state to state, which influences each state’s risk pool and premium changes. Premium rate increases can also be unique to an individual’s circumstances. ""A number of factors can result in a consumer’s premium differing from the average rate change, including changes in: age, tobacco status, geography, benefit design, family status, and subsidy eligibility,"" according to a brief by the American Academy of Actuaries. In other words, individual consumers may find national averages not all that telling when it comes to understanding their own rates. Our ruling Ryan said the health care law is ""making families pay double-digit premium increases."" Ryan has a point that some plans have seen increases of 10 percent or more with insurance purchased on healthcare.gov. However, Ryan is cherry-picking the high end of rate changes. On average, the benchmark plan has increased 7.5 percent, which decreases once premium tax credits and enrollment figures are factored in.

Fact-checking Sanders' claim that U.S. spends 3 times per capita what the U.K. spends on health care
","Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., says the best solution to address problems in the United States’ health care system is to guarantee every American access to health care as a right. Speaking at the New Hampshire Democratic presidential debate, Sanders continued to express support for a single-payer health care system that is popular throughout much of the rest of the world. To make his point, Sanders compared health care costs between the United States and two other Western nations -- the United Kingdom and France. ""Why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K. --  50 percent more than what they pay in France?"" Sanders asked. ""The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress. We need to pass a Medicare-for-all single-payer system."" Sanders’ numbers are arresting and largely correct.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has the data for all three nations. The following table has breakdown. United States United Kingdom France Total (per capita) $8,713 $3,234 $4,123 Public health care (per capita) $4,197 $2802 $3,247 Private health care (per capita) $4,515 $561 $876 Source: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Do the math, and total U.S. spending is about 2.7 times what they spend in the United Kingdom per person, and a bit over twice what they spend per person in France. Everything is measured in dollars, and the data are from 2013. It’s interesting to note the role that public spending makes in each country. In the United States, public and private spending are nearly the same. In the United Kingdom and France, private spending is a much smaller slice of the total. Sanders’ claim in this case is more accurate than more sweeping versions he has made in the past. In 2009 and again in 2015, he claimed that the United States spends twice as much per capita on health care as any other country. Those claims are overly broad. Our ruling Sanders said that the United States spends almost three times on health care per capita what is spent in the United Kingdom and about double what they spend in France.

Fact-checking O'Malley's claim that Hillary Clinton flips on gun issues 'every election'
","Hillary Clinton goes wherever the wind blows on gun control, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said at a Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire. ""Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President (Barack) Obama and saying we don't need federal standards,"" O’Malley said at the Dec. 19, 2015, debate hosted by ABC News. In the wake of several mass shootings this year, Clinton has pushed for stronger federal gun control, so we decided to look back and see if O’Malley is correct that she had a different position on the issue in the past. O’Malley’s campaign sent us several news articles detailing Clinton’s stance on guns. Pre-2008 From the time she was first lady through her 2000 Senate run in New York, Clinton supported strict federal gun control measures. In 1993, then-President Bill Clinton signed into law the Brady bill, which mandated federal background checks and a waiting period for gun purchases, as well as an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. As first lady, Hillary Clinton supported these measures. ""The first step is to take weapons off the streets and to put more police on them,"" she wrote in her 1996 book It Takes a Village. ""Since (the Brady bill) was enacted, more than 40,000 people with criminal records have been prevented from buying guns."" Following the Columbine, Colo., school shooting in April 1999, Clinton pushed for more gun control, including a proposal to raise the legal age to own a handgun from 18 to 21. And during her 2000 Senate run, Clinton endorsed gun registration, photo licenses for gun owners and ballistic fingerprinting. Clinton continued to push for more gun control while serving as the senator from New York, but in her 2008 presidential run, she seemed to back off a bit. 2008 Positioning herself to the right of then-Sen. Barack Obama, Clinton spoke throughout the campaign about the importance of guns to American culture while still defending Bill Clinton’s record on gun control. ""You know, my dad took me out behind the cottage that my grandfather built on a little lake called Lake Winola outside of Scranton and taught me how to shoot when I was a little girl,"" she said at a town hall in 2008. At a 2008 Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Clinton gave an affirmative ""yes"" that she was backing off her 2000 call for a national licensing and registration plan because it would ""preempt"" cities and states’ initiatives. But she also called for reinstating the assault weapons ban and better background checks for potential gun purchasers. Clinton responded to another question about her position on a gun registry at a debate in Philadelphia. ""What might work in New York City is certainly not going to work in Montana,"" she said, explaining her reason to abandon the proposal. ""So, for the federal government to be having any kind of, you know, blanket rules that they're going to try to impose, I think doesn't make sense."" ""I respect the Second Amendment. I respect the rights of lawful gun owners to own guns, to use their guns,"" she went on to say later in the debate. ""But I also believe that most lawful gun owners whom I have spoken with for many years across our country also want to be sure that we keep those guns out of the wrong hands."" While Clinton clearly was no longer in favor of a gun registry out of professed concern for individual states’ needs, she did not wholly reject all federal gun laws. 2016 More so than in her 2008 campaign, Clinton has been forceful and impassioned about gun control this cycle, pushing for universal background checks, closing the so-called gun show loophole, and a bill that aims to stop people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns, among several other measures. ""This epidemic of gun violence knows no boundaries,"" she said in a recent campaign ad. ""We’re better than this. We need to close the loopholes and support universal background checks. How many people have to die before we actually act? Before we come together as a nation?"" Clinton’s list of the gun control measures she would support does not, though, include the gun licensing and registration program she advocated for in 2000 but backed off of in 2008. In sum, O’Malley does have a point that Clinton’s rhetoric and her position on a few specific gun control measures shifted from 2000 to 2008, and then from 2008 to 2015. But in her 2008 campaign, she was not really against all ""federal standards"" because she still called for some federal gun control measures, such as reinstating the assault weapons ban. Our ruling O’Malley ""Secretary Clinton changes her position on (gun issues) every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards."" In 2000, in the wake of the Columbine school shooting, Clinton was emphatic about her support for gun control. In 2008, she dropped her support for a gun license and registration proposal and positioned herself to the right of her major opponent, Obama. While Clinton also advocated for leaving some gun control to the states, she still advocated for federal gun control efforts, and she never said ""we don’t need federal standards."" In 2015, Clinton has been more forceful with her support for gun control than she was in 2008 -- closer to her rhetoric in 2000. O’Malley has a point that Clinton’s positioning on gun control has shifted between election cycles, but it wasn’t nearly as dramatic as he made it out to be.

No evidence for Hillary Clinton's claim that ISIS is using videos of Donald Trump as recruiting tool
","During a Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton took a shot at Republican primary frontrunner Donald Trump, saying that his rhetoric is a gift to ISIS. ""We also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears,"" Clinton said during the debate. ""He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter. They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists."" Not having heard that before, our eyebrows went up when we heard Clinton’s comment, and we weren’t alone. The Twittersphere, on both the right and the left, picked up on Clinton’s statement and questioned whether she had any evidence for it. Extensive Google searches did not turn up any evidence. And the response from the Clinton campaign did not point to any specific videos. The campaign pointed to an NBC News article that quoted Rita Katz of the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors the social media activities of Islamic terrorist groups. ""They love him from the sense that he is supporting their rhetoric,"" she said. ""They follow everything Donald Trump says. When he says, 'No Muslims should be allowed in America,' they tell people, 'We told you America hates Muslims and here is proof.' "" The article also quoted David Phillips, director of the Program on Peace-Building and Rights at Columbia University's Institute for the Study of Human Rights, saying that ""Trump's incendiary anti-Muslim comments will surely be used by ISIS social media to demonize the United States and attract recruits to fight in Iraq and Syria."" But while such quotes support the notion that ISIS could be making recruiting videos, or will do so, they do not support Clinton’s contention -- offered in the present tense -- that they are currently doing so. Vox.com tweeted at J.M. Berger, author of the book ISIS: The State of Terror, and Berger tweeted back, ""I would be surprised if they had and we didn't hear about it in a big way."" For now, it seems that Clinton has turned speculative left-of-center rhetoric into fact. Others have wondered if ISIS will use Trump’s statements against the United States. On Dec. 14, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, told Alisyn Camerota on CNN’s New Day that ""Donald Trump could be a recruitment poster for ISIS because he is fanning the flames of hate."" A few days earlier, Robert Kuttner of the American Prospect, a liberal magazine, wrote a column titled, ""How ISIS and Trump Enable Each Other."" In it, he wrote, ""Trump’s collected speeches are like an ISIS recruiting video."" At PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the person making the claim. We’ll update our fact-check in the event solid evidence emerges. But for now, that evidence does not exist. Our ruling Clinton said that ISIS is ""going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists."" We were unable to find any evidence to support this. The Clinton campaign did not provide any evidence that this is already happening -- only that it could be happening, or that it may in the future. If ISIS was using Trump for recruitment videos, we would expect a frenzy of media coverage over it. We rate this claim False.   UPDATE, Jan. 5, 2016: About two weeks after Clinton’s comment, various news outlets reported that the terrorist group Al Shabaab had released a recruitment video that featured clips of Trump speaking shortly after the Dec. 2 terrorist shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., about his proposal for a temporary but ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S."" As we noted in greater depth here, we aren’t changing our rating, because we rate statements based on evidence that was public at the time the statement was made. Before she made her comment, Clinton had no way of knowing about the Al Shabaab video. SITE Intelligence Group, which found the video, said it was distributed on Twitter on Dec. 31.

Kuster says Republican-backed bill she voted for wouldn't pause resettlement of Syrian refugees
","U.S. Rep Annie Kuster raised eyebrows earlier this month when she claimed on NHPR’s Morning Edition that a bill putting extra restrictions on Syrian refugees wouldn't actually slow down the program. ""The bill would not prohibit Syrian refugees from entering the nation. I think there's been a lot of misinformation frankly about the bill,"" she said. ""It doesn't pause the program. It doesn't apply a religious test. It's a certification that the person does not pose a threat to the security of the United States."" The bit that caught our attention was Kuster’s statement that the the bill ""doesn’t pause the program."" Could that be true? Or did the Democrat go overboard in defending her support of a GOP-backed proposal? We decided to check it out. The bill in question is called the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015. It passed the U.S. House with nearly unanimous Republican support and with the backing of 47 Democrats, including Kuster. According to behind-the-scenes reporting from the Huffington Post, the White House lobbied Democrats to oppose the measure, but ultimately couldn't persuade them all to oppose the bill. So, what's in the SAFE Act? What does it do, and would it actually slow down Syrian refugees coming into the country? It's useful in this case to go to the bill itself. And luckily for us, the SAFE Act is a relatively simple read. Unfortunately, its implications are murkier. Here are the two most pertinent sections of the bill. They’re worth quoting in full, as we’ll see soon enough. ""In addition to the screening conducted by the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall take all actions necessary to ensure that each covered alien receives a thorough background investigation prior to admission as a refugee. A covered alien may not be admitted as a refugee until the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation certifies to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence that each covered alien has received a background investigation that is sufficient to determine whether the covered alien is a threat to the security of the United States. ... ""A covered alien may only be admitted to the United States after the Secretary of Homeland Security, with the unanimous concurrence of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence, certifies to the appropriate Congressional Committees that the covered alien is not a threat to the security of the United States."" The rest of the bill adds reporting requirements and defines the refugees in question as those coming from Iraq or Syria. It does not institute any penalties or consequences for failure to comply with its requirements. A simple distillation of that text comes from the govtrack.us website, which describes it thusly: ""H.R. 4038 would expand the screening process for those refugees attempting to enter the United States by requiring the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to conduct its own background checks in addition to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS). Any refugee would be prohibited from entry until the FBI certifies that they pose no security threat. Refugees would only be admitted with the unanimous agreement of the FBI, DHS, and Director of National Intelligence."" In other words, it adds layers of certification beyond what’s already on the books requiring that refugees are safe before entering the United states. But as Kuster said, the bill does not bar Syrian refugees from the United States, nor does it impose a religious test. What would the legislation mean in practice? The White House certainly had its interpretation, which was the extra requirements would cause big delays. According to an official statement from the executive branch, the bill would ""create significant delays and obstacles in the fulfillment of a vital program that satisfies both humanitarian and national security objectives."" U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI Director James Comey made the same arguments during  a news conference after the bill passed. ""To ask that we have my FBI director make personal guarantees would effectively grind the program to a halt,"" Lynch told reporters last month. And that seemed to be the goal of House Republicans who supported it, at least in part. According to National Public Radio’s reporting, ""Supporters of the bill say it would require a ‘pause’ in admitting Syrian and Iraqi refugees, as current applications would be halted while a new vetting process was established."" But the House Democrats who broke ranks with their party to support the bill disagreed with both the president and Republicans. According to the Huffington Post report mentioned earlier, a Democrat told lawmakers that the bill ""doesn't hurt the refugee process, so put a certification stamp at the bottom and move on."" A top House Democrat cited in the article also said that the defectors had ""a sense that the underlying reforms weren't severe."" In other words, Kuster and 46 other House Democrats decided that if all that was needed was extra certifications, surely they could be put into place without many problems. And while the bill seems to suggest that the FBI would need to conduct an extra background check -- and the bill summary says as much -- the actual text is less clear about what that would entail. It instead reads that ""the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall take all actions necessary to ensure that each covered alien receives a thorough background investigation."" That’s not specifically calling for another check. We contacted Kuster’s office, which said the congresswoman’s intention was to protect the American people. Our ruling U.S. Rep Annie Kuster said the Republican-backed bill she voted for wouldn't pause the resettlement of Syrian refugees. While a number of House Democrats agree with her, the White House and Republicans believe the contrary, saying the bill would either slow down or stop the flow of refugees. Although there’s nothing in the bill that says it will specifically cause a pause, a reasonable reading of the legislation could lead to such an interpretation. Kuster’s claim ignores critical evidence that could lead to an opposite conclusion.

Cruz muddles accusation against Rubio's 2013 immigration bill
","Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio largely battled each other during the Republican debate in Las Vegas, including when Cruz accused Rubio of supporting a bill to let refugees into the country without first being vetted. Cruz singled out what he saw as a major flaw of a 2013 bipartisan immigration bill by the so-called Gang of Eight, which included Rubio and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. ""Border security is national security, and you know, one of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees, without mandating any background checks whatsoever,"" Cruz said. Did Rubio really back an immigration bill that would have allowed refugees from countries in turmoil to come in sans screening? It appears Cruz should work on his own vetting process. Presidential power The Cruz campaign did not get back to us when we asked how S. 744 — which passed the Senate (with Cruz voting no) in 2013 but wasn’t taken up in the House — would have granted the president this power. But when our friends at FactCheck.org looked at a similar claim earlier in December, Cruz’s office directed them to a column by Daniel Horowitz on ConservativeReview.com, a site that named Cruz ""America’s Top Pick"" among GOP candidates. Horowitz highlighted three sections of the bill to justify how the legislation would have opened up the country to substantial refugee risk. ""Had the bill passed in 2013, it would have given the Obama administration power to define who is considered stateless,"" he wrote. ""Most of those likely to be designated as stateless are from Islamic hell holes and would include the Syrians, Somalis, Palestinians, and the Muslim Rohingya in Burma."" Horowitz told us the bill would have granted Obama sweeping power to bestow refugee status on groups as he saw fit. He also said it did nothing to establish standards for background checks on so-called ""stateless"" refugees, who already can’t be checked because there are no databases or information to consult, an argument Rubio has used to argue for prohibiting entry for Syrian refugees. PolitiFact has found that while there may be data gaps, there is a process to vet Syrian refugees. We spoke to several experts, including two resettlement agency officials interviewed by FactCheck.org. We found that their analyses of the bill don’t support Cruz’s claim about new ""blanket authority"" for Obama to admit refugees without any checks. We’ll start with the big picture. Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration, told us the bill did propose sweeping changes, including allowing the government to identify persecuted groups. That could be almost any group in the Middle East, he said. ""The bottom line is that the bill gave the president huge new power that could have changed the refugee system,"" he said. But in the way Cruz alleged? Other experts said no. For one, the president has long had broad authority over refugee admission limits. ""S. 744 didn’t give the president ‘blanket authority to admit refugees,’ "" David Bier, the director of immigration policy at the libertarian Niskanen Center, said in an email. ""The president has had the power since the Refugee Act of 1980 to establish limits on refugees in consultation with Congress. S. 744 didn’t affect this authority."" From 1980-2008, the United States has accepted around 83,000 refugees a year. The Obama administration has said it will accept around 70,000 refugees from around the world in fiscal year 2015. Partly in response to the Syrian refugee crisis, that total will increase to 85,000 refugees in fiscal year 2016 and 100,000 in fiscal year 2017. In 2016, the administration plans to increase the number of admitted Syrian refugees almost six-fold to at least 10,000. What’s more, the Gang of Eight proposal specifically stated that all refugees would still be subject to background checks, Bier added. The average screening time for refugees from across the globe is between a year to a year and a half, involving background checks, interviews and confirmation from several federal agencies. For Syrian refugees, it takes two years on average. Cruz’s claim already misses these important points, but there are some specifics that experts say show his statement is inaccurate. ‘Stateless’ status One point is whether the bill would have allowed Obama to let in any group of refugees, Syrian or otherwise, and give them legal status. Section 3405 would have allowed the attorney general or the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to provide lawful status to a refugee considered ""stateless"" — meaning, they had no country to which the United States could otherwise send them. ""A classic case is a person who entered the United States and applied for asylum whose country dissolved while they were awaiting their hearing and decision in the case,"" said Joanne Kelsey, the assistant director for advocacy at the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, which helps resettle refugees. ""If they were denied asylum and ordered deported, there is no country left to accept them as their national."" Kelsey cited as an example people who were in the United States when the Soviet Union collapsed and new countries were formed from their home regions. But the ""stateless"" classification wouldn’t have been for refugees aiming to get into the United States, only people who are already in the country or would face this situation in the future. Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, another refugee resettlement group, said this would not have changed the number of immigrants allowed into the country. The provision only applied to domestic law, he said, and people would have to prove this status, not just declare it. Persecution problem Another part of the bill about specially designating certain groups of refugees, Section 3403, is an attempt to codify something called the Lautenberg Amendment, an immigration provision that has been in effect since 1989 and must be renewed each year. The amendment has traditionally been aimed at certain religious minorities. By law, refugees seeking asylum in the United States must prove they have a ""well founded fear of persecution."" Our expert sources said section 3403 would have allowed the president to designate a group of interest to the United States as being persecuted as a whole. Think Christians in Syria or Yazidis in Iraq targeted by the Islamic State. Basically, it allows potential refugees to get in line faster. But instead of making the individual prove they are in danger, the threat would already be associated with their group, moving the rest of the screening process along. Its aim was to streamline the vetting process for refugees, not get rid of it. ""It doesn’t create refugees or allow more refugees to come to the United States,"" Bier said. ""They would still be subject to the normal refugee limit. It would create no additional numbers, but would increase, perhaps, the eligible pool of applicants."" Deadline dilemma One final piece concerns the current one-year deadline in place for refugees to file for asylum once they arrive in the United States. Section 3401 would have repealed the deadline, and given people who had applications rejected for missing the window another two years to apply again. There are any number of reasons people miss the deadline — they don’t know they can apply, they’re afraid of government officials or even that they were hoping things in their home countries would get better so they could leave the United States and return. But again, it would only apply to refugees already in the United States, not people seeking to come in the future. Our experts said any worries that this would increase fraudulent immigration are unfounded. ""This provision does not alter any standards or safeguards in the asylum system. All asylum seekers would continue to undergo rigorous security background checks and show that they are admissible to the United States,"" Kelsey said. Our ruling Cruz said, ""One of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees, without mandating any background checks whatsoever."" The failed 2013 bill did not change the number of refugees, the overall framework of the screening process or give the president authority to admit any group at will. It would have allowed the president to designate certain groups outside the United States as particularly at risk, and other officials to label certain refugees in the United States as having nowhere to go. It further would have repealed the deadline for refugees already here to apply for asylum. Experts said none of the provisions Cruz has previously cited work the way he is warning they would.

""The rhetoric that we're seeing, it concerns me,"" Carson said. ""I think most of our largest domestic threat comes from racial supremacist groups. I’ve worked in counterterrorism; I know this to be a fact."" But Carson's statement about ""racial supremacist groups"" posing a larger threat than jihadists isn't cleanly supported by the data that he cites. Carson spokeswoman Jessica Gail said Carson based his assessment on a range of information.  ""The congressman believes that when looking at relative membership numbers, hateful rhetoric, racially based hate crimes, and fatalities by right-wing organizations, it paints a picture of a larger threat to the safety of Americans and society as a whole,"" Gail said. Gail noted the FBI reported that in 2014, 47 percent of hate crimes were racially motivated. But hate crimes include a range of offenses. Violations such as vandalism and intimidation -- a racial slur for example -- represent over half of all hate crimes based on race. While both are bad, the average person wouldn't put them in the same category as an attack by an Islamic extremist. Gail also cited work by the New America Foundation, which keeps a running count of fatal attacks on U.S. soil by ""homegrown extremists"" (it does not count people who were injured in attacks but did not die). The foundation breaks the attacks down into two categories for comparison, ""violent jihadist attacks"" and ""far right-wing attacks."" As for what the latter category includes, the foundation's summaries of each fatal incident describe assailants motivated by anti-government or anti-abortion beliefs. (We've previously noted how conservatives have said the analysis wrongly attributed some of the killings to right-wing zealots when the ideological connection was weak.) Jihadists had killed 45 people as of mid December. Non-jihadist extremists, in the foundation’s view, claimed the lives of 48. The totals go back to just after the 9/11 attacks and include the recent deaths in San Bernadino, Calif., as well as those slain at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado. David Sterman, who oversees the New American project, downplays the slight numerical edge attributed to far non-jihadist violence. ""Future attacks could certainly change which category has killed more people,"" Sterman told us. ""However, the crucial point is not which group has killed more in any particular moment, but that the threat from both streams of extremist thought is very similar in death toll despite a narrative that views jihadist terrorism as having been vastly more deadly inside the U.S."" That might suggest that Carson was technically correct but perhaps overstated his case. However, Carson runs into trouble because he specified ""racial supremacist groups."" In the New American database, only about half of the murders committed by the non-jihadist extremists' side of the ledger were tied to anger directed against any race or ethnic group. Just as often, the killers had expressed anti-government or anti-abortion views. For example, according to the database, the slaying of two police officers in Louisiana in 2012 was committed by members of the Sovereign Citizens movement. Adherents believe that they are not bound by any law passed by the government. The Southern Policy Law Center reports that followers include many blacks. Sterman confirmed that race-based attacks are a subset of the total. Once we factor this in, the foundation’s data set does not provide support for Carson’s statement. Another measure of threat Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University took a different approach to gauging which groups present the biggest risk to the public. Charles Kurzman, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and David Schanzer, a public policy professor at Duke University, went to the law enforcement community. In early 2014, they surveyed nearly 400 law enforcement officers across the country. They asked them to compare the threats from al-Qaida-inspired extremism and an umbrella category for extremism that includes anti-government, racist, anti-capitalist and other motivations. By a 2-1 margin, the officers put the threat of other extremists over that of jihadists. About 74 percent ranked anti-government driven violence among their top three concerns, while a bit under 40 percent put al-Qaida related extremists in their top three. Kurzman told us these results would not support Carson’s statement because ""we did not distinguish white supremacists from other forms of non-Islamic violent extremism in our June 2015 report."" And he noted that further analysis, set to be released in 2016, shows that more law enforcement agencies rank al-Qaida-inspired violence as a higher risk than racist extremism by a margin of 39 percent to 24 percent. Our ruling Carson said that the nation’s largest domestic threat comes from racial supremacist groups, adding that he knew this to be a fact. His spokeswoman said that is based on his compilation of various trends and reports. However, we could find no data to support the view that attacks driven by overtly racist beliefs cause more deaths or are seen by law enforcement as a greater risk than jihadist extremism.

Greg Abbott incorrectly says Obama 'himself' admitted refugees who helped terrorists
","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott warned at a Washington, D.C. press conference that without fresh restrictions on who enters the U.S., the Islamic State could slip in attackers. Compounding ""these dangers,"" Abbott went on, ""the president himself has granted waivers allowing into the United States refugees who provided material support to terrorists."" Barack Obama did that? Abbott didn’t respond to requests for backup. Meantime, we learned waivers have been granted to admit terrorist-connected refugees for about a decade though the waivers weren’t any president’s call nor is ""material support"" always as threatening as it might sound. A web search initially led us to a September 2015 post by Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption, stating that according to a federal report, 1,519 ""inadmissible"" foreigners had been approved to enter the U.S. in 2014 by Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary--and more than half the candidates had provided material support to terrorists. ""After a case-by-case review,"" Judicial Watch said, Johnson ""determined that the recently admitted terrorists only participated in these activities ‘while under duress.’"" Federal report to Congress The cited September 2015 report to Congress came from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency that’s part of Homeland Security. It states that Johnson, in consultation with the U.S. secretary of state and attorney general, had determined at his ""sole unreviewable discretion"" that restrictions in the Immigration and Nationality Act, the main federal law regulating U.S. immigration procedures, ""shall not apply."" The act’s section 212 (a)(3)(B) bars from entry anyone who ""has engaged in"" or incited ""a terrorist activity"" or is considered likely to do so and anyone who’s a representative or member of a terrorist group or received military training from one. It further blocks a member of a group that endorses or espouses terrorist activity unless the person can demonstrate ""by clear and convincing evidence"" he or she didn’t know, and shouldn’t reasonably have known, that the group was terrorist. The law also invokes material support, which ""includes actions such as providing a safe house, transportation, counterfeit documents or funds to a terrorist organization or its members. It also includes any action that can assist a terrorist organization or one of its members in any way, such as providing food, helping to set up tents, distributing literature or making a small monetary contribution,"" USCIS sums up. The report states the 1,519 exemptions processed in the 12 months through September 2014 included 627 for an applicant’s provision of material support, ""while under duress,"" to a terrorist organization that has never targeted U.S. interests or persons as well as 189 for giving material support, while under duress, to one of more than 50 foreign terrorist organizations designated by the Secretary of State (including Boko Haram, the Palestinian Liberation Front, Al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) or one of another 50-plus groups placed by the secretary, in accord with the USA Patriot Act of 2001, on the government’s terrorist exclusion list. See all the reasons refugees were approved for waivers here. Each waiver is handled on a case-by-case basis, the report says, ""after careful review of all factors and all security checks have cleared."" A Homeland Security spokeswoman, Marsha Catron, responded to our query about Abbott’s statement by stressing the government's general background checks of refugees. Waivers rooted in law Obama has no statutory role in granting the waivers, legal experts told us, while Congress has gradually widened the discretion of the secretaries of State and Homeland Security to do so. The Patriot Act, enacted shortly after the 9/11 attacks, and the REAL ID Act in 2005 included important provisions, according to a September 2015 article in the Brigham Young University Law Review, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 expanded the waiver authority of executive officials, permitting the Secretary of State in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the attorney general to waive nearly all terrorism-related exclusions built into law. Judicial Watch’s post noted a February 2014 ""notice of determination"" issued by the departments of State and Homeland Security stating the terrorist exclusion law ""shall not apply with respect to an alien who provided limited material support"" to such a group such as ""certain routine commercial transactions or certain routine social transactions (i.e., in the satisfaction of certain well-established or verifiable family, social, or cultural obligations), (2) certain humanitarian assistance, or (3) substantial pressure that does not rise to the level of duress, provided, however, that the"" individual is otherwise qualified for admission, has cleared background and security checks and poses no danger to the U.S., among conditions. Jennifer Daskal, an American University law professor, said the notice looks in step with existing law. Broadly, Daskal elaborated by email, Congress authorized such waivers to protect groups that could otherwise be barred from entry, such as Montagnards and Hmong, who fought alongside the U.S. during the Vietnam war from being denied visas as ""material supporters of terrorism"" and, Daskal said, to protect rape victims who were forced into servitude by groups like the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda from being denied visas on terrorism grounds, among problematic situations. By phone, David A. Martin, former principal deputy general counsel for Homeland Security in the Obama administration, said the waiver power was initially applied by Bush’s secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice.   The lawyers said Abbott’s mention of ""material support"" could leave the misimpression that refugees admitted by waiver pose dangers. Under the law, Martin said, even someone who provides a bowl of rice at gunpoint to a terrorist could be excluded from entering as a refugee-- absent a waiver. Wadie E. Said, professor of law at the University of South Carolina, called the ""material support"" part of the law ""exceedingly broad,"" leaving no room for nuance. Our ruling Abbott said ""the president himself has granted waivers allowing into the United States refugees who provided material support to terrorists."" The Homeland Security secretary--not the president--grants case-by-case waivers in accord with federal law enabling people with tenuous connections to terrorist groups to be admitted as refugees. This claim ignores the fact that material support under the law doesn’t always mean someone has committed or supported violent acts. Unsaid too: The law permitting the waivers predates Obama’s presidency. We rate this statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
