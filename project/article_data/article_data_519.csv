"['National', 'Education', 'Arne Duncan']","
Barack Obama is not the first president to address schoolchildren.
","
Education Secretary Arne Duncan urged the nation's principals to allow their students to watch a Sept. 8 address on the importance of education from President Barack Obama.
 
""The president will challenge students to work hard, set educational goals, and take responsibility for their learning,"" Duncan wrote, adding, ""This is the first time an American president has spoken directly to the nation's schoolchildren about persisting and succeeding in school. We encourage you to use this historic moment to help your students get focused and begin the school year strong.""
 
The speech drew fire from some Republicans who said schoolchildren should not be required to listen to the Democratic president's address. The Republican Party of Florida went further, saying Obama would ""indoctrinate"" schoolchildren with ""socialist ideology,"" forcing them ""to watch the president justify his plans for government-run health care, banks, and automobile companies, increasing taxes on those who create jobs, and racking up more debt than any other president."" We rated that claim

Pants on Fire!

 
But Duncan was wrong when he wrote that Obama's speech would be ""the first time an American president has spoken directly to the nation's schoolchildren about persisting and succeeding in school.""
 
President George H.W. Bush gave an address to schools nationwide in 1991, from a junior high school in Washington, D.C. News reports from the time said the White House hoped that the address would be shown at schools nationwide, and Bush began his remarks by saying he was talking to ""millions"" of students ""in classrooms all across the country.""
 
You can read Bush's

complete remarks

via the Web site of his presidential library. Here's an excerpt:
 
""When it comes to your own education, what I'm saying is take control. Don't say school is boring and blame it on your teachers. Make your teachers work hard. Tell them you want a first-class education. Tell them that you're here to learn. Block out the kids who think it's not cool to be smart. I can't understand for the life of me what's so great about being stupid. ...
 
""If you don't work hard, who gets hurt? If you cheat, who pays the price? If you cut corners, if you hunt for the easy A, who comes up short? Easy answer to that one: You do. You're in control, but you are not alone. People want you to succeed. They want to help you succeed.""
 
The presidential library noted that the president spoke at 12:15 p.m. and that his remarks were ""broadcast live by the Cable News Network, the Public Broadcasting System, the Mutual Broadcasting System, and the NBC radio network.""
 
You may have guessed this already, but news reports from the time indicate that Democrats criticized Bush for giving the speech.
 
""The Department of Education should not be producing paid political advertising for the president, it should be helping us to produce smarter students,"" said Rep. Richard Gephardt, then the Democratic majority leader in the House of Representatives.""And the president should be doing more about education than saying, 'Lights, camera, action.'""
 
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of Congress from Colorado, said the speech showed ""the arrogance of power,"" and that the White House should not be ""using precious dollars for campaigns"" when ""we are struggling for every silly dime we can get"" for education.
 
Republicans, though, defended the right of the president to address students. ""Why is it political for the president of the United States to discuss education?"" asked Newt Gingrich, who was then the House Republican whip. ""It was done at a nonpolitical site and was beamed to a nonpolitical audience. . . . They wanted to reach the maximum audience with the maximum effect to improve education.""
 
We also found that Ronald Reagan took questions from high school students at the White House in 1986, and the question-and-answer session was broadcast nationally.
 
Reagan urged the students to stay in school and say no to drugs, but he also discussed overtly political matters, such as national defense funding, nuclear disarmament and — in suprising policy detail — taxes. (Read Reagan's

complete remarks

.)
 
""When we came into office, the top personal tax rate that the federal government could put on your income was 70 percent,"" Reagan said in his opening remarks. ""Now, you can understand, I think, that if you were getting up in those brackets — there were 14 different tax brackets, depending on the amount of money in each bracket you earned. And when you could look and say, 'If I earn another dollar, I only get to keep 30 cents out of it,' you can imagine the lack of incentive there. Well, we lowered it to 50 percent, and the economy really took off.""
 
Later in the session, a student asked Reagan what he considered his greatest achievement as president. Reagan said it was that the House and Senate had separately passed legislation cutting taxes, and he was looking forward to seeing the legislation finalized and become law.
 
""So, I think the fact that we have finally gotten the Congress of the United States to deal with this problem of tax reform is the greatest achievement,"" Reagan said. ""And I'm going to be riding herd all the way to see that we finally get it through.""
 
We looked for news reports of Democrats protesting Reagan's broadcast, but were unable to find any in electronic research databases. We should emphasize that this may be due to the fact that many news reports from 1986 are unavailable online.
 
We feel that President George H.W. Bush's speech to students is enough evidence to show that Obama was not the first president to speak ""directly to the nation's schoolchildren about persisting and succeeding in school."" Bush's speech was quite explicitly ""about persisting and succeeding in school."" Duncan's statement is not accurate, so we rate it False.

"['Environment', 'National', 'Cap and Trade', 'Climate Change', 'Energy', ""Investor's Business Daily""]","
IBD editorial board claims that cap-and-trade is unpopular in America
","The editorial board of  Investor's Business Daily  says the supporters of a cap-and-trade bill face an uphill battle. 
 
In a Sept. 2, 2009, op-ed about the European stake in a climate change bill passed by the House of Representatives, the editors wrote, ""Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans. No matter how many suave European continentals you send here, it won't change voters' minds.""
 
To support their claim, the board included a June 28-29 Rasmussen poll that shows that 56 percent of Americans said they wouldn't pay more taxes to cut greenhouse gases. The question — and the op-ed — leave out the important fact that the bill doesn't impose new taxes (though it's likely people would see higher utility bills as the result of cap-and-trade, which would raise the cost of energy at least slightly).
 
But the claim piqued our interest nevertheless, so we decided to check other polls to see how the plan is playing among voters.
 
The background: Cap-and-trade is a way to slow climate change by reducing carbon emissions. The idea is to cap emissions and require firms to either buy polluting permits or upgrade to cleaner technologies. House lawmakers included such a plan in a bill passed on June 26 that will lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050.
 
So let's look at how much support it has. A  Washington Post  /ABC News survey published on June 25, a day before the bill was passed, showed that 75 percent of Americans think the government should regulate greenhouse gas emissions to reduce global warming. About 52 percent support a cap-and-trade program to accomplish that. Opposition has grown to 42 percent, up from 34 percent in the summer of 2008.
 
The same pollsters did a follow-up survey Aug. 13-17 and found that support for cap-and-trade was unchanged. This time, however, the poll provided more detail. About 58 percent said they would support the idea if it raised monthly electric bills by 10 dollars. But when that cost went up to 25 dollars, support dropped to 39 percent.
 
(We've already explored different opinions on how much the legislation might cost, and you can read about them  here  .)
 
Meanwhile, a Zogby poll published on Aug. 11 found that 71 percent of Americans support the legislation that was passed in the House.
 
It's worth noting that all those numbers are up from polls that were taken earlier in the year, before the bill was debated and passed in the House. For example, in April, a Zogby poll found that 30 percent of respondents supported cap-and-trade. And a CNN poll done one month later found that 44 percent favor a cap-and-trade plan. 
 
So, given the most recent polling, it would be fair to say that a slight majority of Americans support cap-and-trade but that those numbers may decrease depending on how much it would cost in higher utility bills. Even so, at its lowest, nearly 40 percent of Americans would still support cap-and-trade even if it meant heftier energy bills. In no case do polling numbers show that cap-and-trade is ""wildly unpopular,"" as the editors of  IBD  claim, so we give this one a False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC0092C0>],/factchecks/2009/sep/03/ibdeditorialscom/ibd-editorial-board-claims-cap-and-trade-unpopular/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Haley Barbour']","
Barbour claims Obama took longer to choose a dog than he's giving nation to overhaul health care system
","
Republicans have been complaining for weeks that President Barack Obama is trying to rush his health care reform bill through Congress. To make their point now, they've gone to the dogs.


In an Aug. 13 op-ed in the

Washington Examiner

, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour invoked Bo, the White House dog, to illustrate how quickly Obama has tried to pass the 1,000-page bill. Barbour, who chairs the Republican Governors Association and has been mentioned as a possible 2012 presidential contender, wrote, ""It took Obama six months to pick out a family dog. Cramming health care reform down the country's throat in a fraction of that time scares people who have been told, accurately, the various bills contain a billion-dollar combination of tax increases and Medicare spending cuts.""


To judge whether Obama tried to pass the bill ""in a fraction"" of the time it took him to choose the Portuguese water dog requires examining the

timeline

for both the health care bill and the selection of Bo. And that's not as easy it might sound.


We could choose various dates for the beginning of the dog selection. We could go as far back as Obama's mention of his dog promise in an interview with

Men's Health

magazine in August 2008, or as recently as his inauguration on Jan. 20, when he and his family moved into the White House. But we believe it's fair to say the process started with the Obama election night celebration on Nov. 4, 2008, when Obama declared that his daughters Sasha and Malia ""have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House."" It was at that point that speculation began in earnest about what kind of dog they might get.


The end date for the puppy hunt is a little imprecise as well. According to the definitive

Washington Post

account of the dog search, Bo had a ""clandestine White House visit in which he won over the Obama girls and their parents"" some time in March or early April. Not knowing exactly when it took place, we'll date the end of the search on April 12, when word of the new pooch became breaking news.


Total elapsed time: 160 days. That's a bit less than the six months Barbour cited, but we think it's a reasonable estimate and won't knock Barbour for being a bit off.


Now, on to more serious matters: health care reform.


Here too we face some choices about the start and end dates. We could go all the way back to May 29, 2007, when candidate Obama first unveiled a comprehensive health care proposal in Iowa. Or we could use March 5, 2009, when Obama invited lawmakers and industry leaders to the White House for a forum that included ""breakout sessions"" and a question-and-answer period to discuss the possible elements of health care legislation. Or we could use July 14, 2009, when House Democratic leaders formally introduced H.R. 3200, the massive bill that's still under discussion.


After much internal discussion, we settled on March 5, the date of the forum. That was the point when the Obama administration signaled that health care reform was a key priority. Obama told participants that the forum was ""the first discussion in this effort, but it was not the last.""


As for the end date, Democratic leaders and the White House tried to have the bills passed by the House and the Senate by the start of the August recess — July 31, 2009, for the House and Aug. 7, 2009, for the Senate. It didn't happen, but that seems to be what Barbour was referring to when he said Obama had tried to ""cram"" the legislation through. (Barbour's office did not respond to our request for more details.)


If you start the clock on March 5 and stop it at Aug. 7, it works out to 156 days. That is just a smidgen less than the 160 days it took to find Bo, but it's very close, so it is a stretch to say, as Barbour did, that the health care effort took ""a fraction"" of the time it took to find a dog.


A more favorable comparison from Barbour's perspective would be to start the clock with the introduction of the House bill on July 14. That would make the total duration of the debate a mere 25 days. Using those dates, Barbour would be right to call it a fraction of the 160-day-long dog search. However, choosing such a late start date strikes us as cherry-picking. The health care discussion among lawmakers, the media and the public was well under way by July 14, and the details of the bill had been swirling for weeks, even if they were not in legislative language yet.


Ultimately, determining whether Barbour is right depends on which dates you choose. Let us propose an additional caveat, however. No one ever promised that a bill would be ready for the president to sign by the start of August recess. Even if the original goal was to have a bill through both chambers by then, it would still require a House-Senate conference committee to iron out what were sure to be significant differences. Once lawmakers managed to hammer out a consensus bill, both chambers would need time to debate the new measure, pass the bill individually, and send it on to the president. That would likely take several weeks.


Given this reality, another conceivable ending date would actually be Oct. 30, 2009 — the target date for the House to adjourn. Using that as the end date, the duration of the health care debate would be 240 days (when starting with March 5, which would be much longer than picking the dog) or 109 days (when starting with July 14, or shorter than the dog selection but not really ""a fraction."").


So this is one where reasonable people can reach different conclusions. We examined three scenarios and found his claim is only right under the most extreme one — when you start the clock at the July introduction of the bill and stop it at the August recess. But under what we consider the most realistic scenario, starting with the March forum and ending with the October adjournment, Barbour is wrong. So we find his claim Barely True.

"['Environment', 'National', 'Climate Change', 'John Kerry']","
Kerry claims the Arctic will be ice-free by summer 2013
","Sen. John Kerry says climate change is happening faster than we think.
 
In an Aug. 31, 2009, op-ed in the Huffington Post, the Massachusetts Democrat wrote that the threat of climate change ""is not an abstract concern for the future.""
 
""It is already upon us and its effects are being felt worldwide, right now,"" he wrote. ""Scientists project that the Arctic will be ice-free in the summer of 2013. Not in 2050, but four years from now. Make no mistake: catastrophic climate change represents a threat to human security, global stability, and — yes — even to American national security.""
 
We don't debate that the effects of climate change are already being felt. However, Kerry's claim that the Arctic will be ice-free in as little as five years is ominous and worth putting to the Truth-O-Meter.

Arctic ice has long been considered a canary in a coal mine for climate scientists; they watch it closely because significant melts indicate an acceleration of climate change effects. In fact, temperatures actually rise faster in icy regions because of something known as ice albedo feedback loop. Ice is more reflective than land or water. When ice melts, the reflectivity of the Earth's surface decreases as well, and more solar radiation is absorbed by the land and the oceans. So, as ice melts, more and more heat from the sun is absorbed, accelerating the warming process.

Melting has recently become a more serious problem, and 2007 was a particularly bad year for the Arctic. Then, about 552 billion tons of ice melted from Greenland's ice sheet during the summer — about 15 percent more than the summer average.

The summer of 2009 didn't look much better. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the average rate of melt in July of this year is nearly identical to that of July 2007, in part due to unusual weather patterns and an underlying trend toward higher temperatures.

But does this mean ice will be completely gone in the next few years? We talked to Julienne Stroeve, a researcher for the NSIDC, for some perspective.

Climate scientists ""agree that we'll lose summer ice cover,"" she said. ""As to the exact date, it varies between groups."" The summer ice cover is what's left of the sea ice after the annual seasonal melting. It refreezes when temperatures drop. Indeed, predictions are all over the map. Kerry got his data from Wieslaw Maslowski, a researcher from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., who as early as 2007 predicted the Arctic would be ice-free by the summer of 2013. Similar projections have been trumpeted by a handful of other scientists, including Warwick Vincent, director of the Center for Northern Studies at Laval University in Quebec and NASA climate scientist Jay Zwally. (A Kerry spokeswoman directed us to this 2007  article  about Maslowski's work.)

Meanwhile, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations group relying on the consensus of hundreds of climate scientists, estimated in 2007 that summer ice would largely be gone in the latter part of the 21st century; and Stroeve said NSIDC supports a prediction of 2030.

NASA climate researcher Gavin Schmidt wrote in an e-mail to us that Maslowski's prediction isn't necessarily a communitywide opinion.

""A fair statement would be that some scientists have predicted summer ice free Arctic Ocean as soon as 2013, but others expect it to happen a little slower — say 2040-2060,"" Schmidt wrote.

Differences occur when research focuses on the area of the Arctic — based on aerial satellite photographs — or on thickness and volume of the ice as well as area, according to Maslowski. In both cases, scientists have seen melting, Maslowski said. However, when estimates are based on the latter method, as Maslowski and his team of researchers have done, melting seems to be happening much faster.

""There is no crystal ball, there is no final prediction, just estimates,"" Maslowski said. ""All we are trying to show is that we better start thinking [ice-free summers] could start earlier than 2100 or 2030. We should be prepared for the worst-case scenario.""

Kerry's claim also leaves out an important nuance; as Stroeve said, most climate scientists agree that  summer  ice is likely to disappear at some point, but that the oceans will still freeze in the winter for a very long time. However, Kerry's op-ed could make it sound as if the Arctic will devoid of ice all year long.

As always with the climate change debate, we've found that there's a wide range of informed opinion on the issue of Arctic melting. In a general sense, Kerry is correct that Arctic ice is melting at a quickening rate. However, he has based his prediction on the earliest and most extreme estimate, when a much wider range of estimates are available and most project the turning point will occur decades from now. And he makes it seem as if the Arctic will be totally ice-free within a few short years when in fact that would only be true for the summer. As a result, we rate Kerry's statement Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD7FE80>],/factchecks/2009/sep/02/john-kerry/kerry-claims-arctic-will-be-ice-free-2013/

Organizing for America says media won't check facts, but we find many debunking reports.

Normally, modesty would forbid us factchecking an item about media factchecking.
 
But we couldn't ignore statements in a recent e-mail from Organizing for America, the Democratic advocacy group that emerged from Barack Obama's campaign organization.
 
""Friend,"" begins a

fundraising e-mail

from the group signed by director Mitch Stewart. ""Over the past few months, two things have become clear about the fight for health insurance reform.
 
""1. Our opponents will create and spread outrageous lies to try to stop President Obama from creating real change. 2. We just can't count on the media to debunk them.""
 
The e-mail asks for cash contributions to help Organizing for America fight back.

Lest we be accused of

tooting


our

here, we'll confine ourselves to a review of some of the

other

media coverage of the health reform battle.
 
Factcheck.org has debunked many false claims, including an e-mail analysis of

what's in a bill

being considered in the House of Representatives, as well as a list of ""

seven big myths

"" about health reform.
 
CNN's ""Truth Squad"" has  looked at whether you have to go blind

in one eye

before getting eye care (wrong!) and many other false claims about health care. The Truth Squad cataloged all their fact-checks on their

.
 
There's also the Associated Press. They reported several fact-checking pieces, including looking at claims

, as well as claims about

euthanasia

and

illegal immigrants

.
 
CQ Politics

reported a story

on whether health care would be rationed, whether employees could be automatically enrolled in a public plan, and whether the government would have real-time access to bank accounts, among other things. Nope, nope and nope.
 
We could go on (and on), but you get the picture. There is no shortage of reporting on false claims about health care.
 
We know, based on our own reader e-mail, that there is still a lot of confusion about health care reform and what it entails, including among those who are truly undecided. And we've also heard from readers who have negative, factually incorrect ideas about health care reform and don't want to be argued out of their beliefs.
 
Mitch Stewart of Organizing for America might not like the fact that some Americans remain unconvinced. They also probably don't like it that town halls during August have been packed with people making erroneous claims, or that some pundits think Obama is losing the debate over health care.
 
But for Organizing for America to say that the media isn't debunking false claims about health care is wrong -- demonstrably wrong. In fact, it's laughably delusional. We rate their statement Pants on Fire!

"['National', 'Education', 'Republican Party of Florida']","
Republican Party of Florida says Obama will ""indoctrinate"" schoolchildren with ""socialist ideology""
","
President Barack Obama plans to speak to the nation's schoolchildren on Sept. 8. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the speech will be about ""the importance of persisting and succeeding in school,"" and the department is offering classroom materials to ""engage students and stimulate discussion on the importance of education in their lives.""
 
You might think that would be a harmless topic, and that people across the political spectrum could agree on the importance of education.
 
Not so for the Republican Party of Florida, which released a statement ""condemning President Obama's use of taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate America’s children to his socialist agenda.""
 
""As the father of four children, I am absolutely appalled that taxpayer dollars are being used to spread President Obama's socialist ideology,"" said Jim Greer, party chairman, in a news release.
 
""The idea that schoolchildren across our nation will be forced to watch the president justify his plans for government-run health care, banks, and automobile companies, increasing taxes on those who create jobs, and racking up more debt than any other president, is not only infuriating, but goes against beliefs of the majority of Americans, while bypassing American parents through an invasive abuse of power,"" he added. 
 
""The Democrats have clearly lost the battle to maintain control of the message this summer, so now that school is back in session, President Obama has turned to American’s children to spread his liberal lies, indoctrinating American’s youngest children before they have a chance to decide for themselves,"" he concluded.
 
The release, which we received via e-mail, told us to

click a link

to learn more about Obama's speech.
 
That took us to the U.S. Department of Education Web site, where Secretary Arne Duncan wrote that the speech was about ""the importance of education.""
 
""The president will challenge students to work hard, set educational goals, and take responsibility for their learning,"" Duncan wrote. ""He will also call for a shared responsibility and commitment on the part of students, parents and educators to ensure that every child in every school receives the best education possible so they can compete in the global economy for good jobs and live rewarding and productive lives as American citizens.""
 
We asked the Republican Party of Florida for evidence that Obama intended to discuss health care, banks, automobile companies or taxes with the nation's schoolchildren. They couldn't point us to anything.
 
A spokesman said the party was particularly concerned about the study questions the department had provided. ""The goal of these materials is to tell students why they should support President Obama in his overall agenda,"" said Katie Gordon.
 
""If the former administration had done something like this, the media would be handling this a lot differently,"" she added.
 
We reviewed the study materials but didn't see any mention of controversial issues, let alone any attempt to indoctrinate students in socialism. The

pre-K through 6th grade

materials said the main ideas of the speech would be ""citizenship, personal responsibility, civic duty."" The materials for

high schoolers

mention ""personal responsibility, goals, persistence.""
 
We searched previous media reports to see if former President George W. Bush ever gave a nationwide address to schoolchildren, but based on our search, it appears he did not. He did, however, regularly visit individual schools and discuss the importance of education with students.
 
We did learn, however, that President George H.W. Bush addressed the nation's students in a televised speech during school hours in 1991. ''I can't understand for the life of me what's so great about being stupid,'' Bush said, according to news reports from the time. He told students to ''block out the kids who think it's not cool to be smart'' and ''work harder, learn more.''
 
Democrats at the time criticized the speech. ""The Department of Education should not be producing paid political advertising for the president, it should be helping us to produce smarter students,"" said Richard Gephardt, then the Democratic majority leader in the House of Representatives.
 
Republican Newt Gingrich defended Bush's speech, though. ""Why is it political for the president of the United States to discuss education?"" Gingrich said at the time. ""It was done at a nonpolitical site and was beamed to a nonpolitical audience. . . . They wanted to reach the maximum audience with the maximum effect to improve education.""
 
But we digress.
 
In ruling on Greer's statement, we wondered whether we should give him latitude for legitimate commentary on Obama's speech. But he crossed a line when he said that Obama intended to discuss ""plans for government-run health care, banks, and automobile companies"" and other policy matters not germane to education. That is factually incorrect, and the party could not offer any support for the statement. For raising the specter of socialist ideology and indoctrination, the party takes its claim to an additional, absurd level. We rate the Republican Party of Florida's statement Pants on Fire!
 

Update, Sept. 3

: Since we published this item, the Department of Education has modified a line in its classroom materials about the president's speech. A bullet point for activities after the speech used to say, ""Write letters to themselves about what they can do to help the president. These would be collected and redistributed at an appropriate later date by the teacher to make students accountable to their goals."" Now it states, ""Write letters to themselves about how they can achieve their short–term and long–term education goals. These would be collected and redistributed at an appropriate later date by the teacher to make students accountable to their goals.""
 
That change, however, does not alter our ruling. Based on the press release that the Republican Party of Florida used as a basis for this claim, there remains no evidence that Obama intends to discuss the controversial policy issues of health care, banking, the automotive industry, taxes or the national debt during his address to students. And so we still find the party's claim to be Pants on Fire.

Private insurance plans say public has 'strong satisfaction' with their coverage
","
Opponents of President Barack Obama's health care reform plan say if ain't broke, don't fix it. They're referring to the current health care system in which most Americans get coverage from private insurers. They say most people are happy with private insurance and that it would be a mistake to mess with that.


On CNN's

Lou Dobbs Show

on Aug. 27, 2009, Michael Tuffin, a spokesman for the insurance trade group America's Health Insurance Plans, cited public opinion in arguing that Congress should not approve a government-run insurance option.


""What we need to do is to fix the insurance market so we get everybody covered,"" Tuffin said. ""Make pre-existing conditions a thing of the past. Build on the system that works well for about 85 percent of Americans. Every survey shows strong satisfaction with private coverage. We need to build on that system rather than put it at risk with a government-run plan.""


We wondered if Tuffin was right that ""every survey shows strong satisfaction."" So we checked the poll results and called experts.


We looked at a selection of recent polls in the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation's searchable database of health care survey data. At least two types of questions shed some light on Tuffin's assertion.


The question that's most directly on point asks whether the respondent is satisfied with his or her current health plan. The exact wording varies from poll to poll and we'll leave out questions that ask broadly about health care (rather than health plans) because it includes many factors beyond just insurance.


A second, related question asks people if they are satisfied with the cost of their health care.


We'll start with some examples of the first question.


A June 2009 poll by ABC News and the

Washington Post

found that 42 percent of respondents were ""very satisfied"" with their health plan and 39 percent were ""somewhat satisfied."" Just 11 percent were ""somewhat dissatisfied"" and 8 percent were ""very dissatisfied."" Meanwhile, a July 2009 poll by Abt SRBI for

Time

magazine found 53 percent very satisfied, 33 percent somewhat satisfied, 9 percent somewhat dissatisfied and 4 percent very dissatisfied. A Quinnipiac University poll found 49 percent very satisfied, 36 percent somewhat satisfied, 10 percent somewhat dissatisfied and 4 percent very dissatisfied.


Even a survey by a Democratic polling firm — Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research for Democracy Corps — found the same general contours. In that June 2009 poll, 44 percent said they were very satisfied, 27 percent said they were somewhat satisfied, 11 percent said they were somewhat dissatisfied and 14 percent said they were very dissatisfied.


Gallup asks the question somewhat differently in a survey conducted every November. Between 2001 and 2008, 20 to 28 percent of respondents rated their health care coverage ""excellent"" while between 39 and 51 percent rated their coverage ""good.""


So, recent surveys generally indicate that Americans are satisfied with their current coverage, although it's not always the ""strong satisfaction"" that Tuffin claimed, especially in the Gallup data, in which ""good"" outpaces ""excellent"" by roughly 2-to-1.


And the results for the other question undercut the notion of ""strong satisfaction.""


When the June 2009 CBS-

New York Times

poll asked respondents what they felt about the cost of their premiums and the items not covered by their insurance, 23 percent said they were very satisfied, 27 percent said somewhat satisfied, 15 percent said not too satisfied and 33 percent — a plurality — said they were not at all satisfied.


And when an ABC-

Post

poll from the same month asked the same question, the results were 23 percent very satisfied, 31 percent somewhat satisfied, 19 percent somewhat dissatisfied and 25 percent very dissatisfied.


We asked three experts on health care polling — Robert Blendon of the Harvard School of Public Health, Eric Nielsen, the senior director for media strategies at Gallup and Karlyn Bowman of the conservative American Enterprise Institue — for their view on the data. All agreed that people have consistently said they were satisfied with their health coverage. But Blendon and Nielsen emphasized that these polls have a major complicating factor. Pollsters almost always ask the questions to people who actually have insurance. That means the millions of Americans who are uninsured — and presumably aren't very happy — aren't included in the results.


Another significant complication is that most polls do not differentiate between respondents who have private insurance and those who have Medicare, Medicaid or other government-run plans. (Nor, for that matter, do they differentiate between satisfaction levels for, say, HMOs and fee-for-service plans.) Gallup typically finds that between 26 and 33 percent of its respondents to the health care poll — not a trivial fraction — are covered through Medicare or Medicaid. For this reason, it's harder to say whether private insurance is more popular with consumers than government-run programs are.


An AHIP spokesman told PolitiFact that the combination of ""very"" and ""somewhat"" satisfied — which together account for a big majority in every poll — justifies Tuffin's use of the phrase ""strong satisfaction.""
 
But we think that to be ""somewhat satisfied,"" as a big chunk of Americans are in every poll, falls short of ""strong satisfaction."" At the same time, many poll respondents expressed concerns about costs of the health care system. And since most independent polling data doesn't separate Americans' feelings about Medicare and Medicaid from private plans, it's an overreach to attribute Americans' warm feelings about their coverage simply to private insurance. On balance, then, we give Tuffin a Half True.

Barack Obama poll after seven months shows him behind other presidents
","
The pundits and prognosticators are saying President Barack Obama is losing his mojo.
 
And they have facts to back up their claim.
 
""Since World War II, only Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton have had worse ratings after seven months than President Obama,"" said Republican Newt Gingrich, offering advice to Obama on the op-ed page of the

Washington Post.

 
Gingrich's comment was part of a roundup of advice solicited by the

Post

for the supposedly faltering president; Gingrich advised Obama to reject his left-leaning supporters and move to the center.
 
Being but humble fact-checkers, we can't speak to the wisdom or folly of Gingrich's advice. But we certainly can check his factual statement about Obama's poll numbers, a claim we've seen repeated in other media.
 
The Gallup poll actually has been tracking presidential approval ratings since World War II. We consulted Gallup's tracking polls and found that Gingrich is correct. At the seven-month mark, Obama's approval rating was 51 percent. The only two presidents doing worse than Obama were Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton.
 
Interestingly, Ford and Clinton finished their presidencies with decidely different outcomes.
 
Ford's public approval ratings dropped below 50 percent about three months into his presidency. Those numbers improved slightly and plateaued over the next few years. But Ford, who took office upon Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974, lost the 1976 election to Jimmy Carter.
 
Clinton's approval ratings dropped below 50 percent four months into his presidency, falling even further during his first year in office to the high 30s. There were a few more ups and downs during his first term, but he won re-election in 1996 and finished his term in 2001 with approval ratings above 60 percent, despite being impeached by the House of Representatives after a sex scandal.
 
Make of all this what you will. We've looked into Gingrich's statement and found that he is correct. We rate his statement True.

Dean claims Social Security and Medicare were passed without Republican support
","With virtually no Republican support for the health care reform bill, some Democrats believe they will have to go it alone.     But Howard Dean, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, isn't worried about the political repercussions.   When asked about the risks of abandoning efforts for a bipartisan bill, Dean had this to say:   ""All the really great programs in American history, Social Security, was done without Republicans. Medicare was done without Republican support until the last vote where they realized they had to get on board,"" Dean said on the Aug. 25, 2009, episode of  The Rachel Maddow Show  . ""So a lot of the things that have been done that have helped seniors in particular have been done without Republican support at all and there's not going to be any political penalty. The only political penalty will be suffered is if we don't pass a bill and the Republicans know that.  And that's why they're not interested in helping pass the bill.""   Our recollection about the votes on Social Security and Medicare was a little rusty, and we wondered whether Dean was right that both bills passed with no Republican support.   To find out, we had to turn back the clock to 1935 — the height of the Great Depression — when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, an insurance program funded through taxpayer dollars meant to support retirees. The legislation was controversial for a number of reasons, including its perceived effects on the labor market and whether its benefits favored working white men.     Nevertheless, on Aug. 8, 1935, the conference report — the final version of the bill that melds together changes made in the House and in the Senate — passed in the House 372-33, with 81 Republicans voting in support. The next day, the bill was passed in the Senate 77-6, with 16 Republicans supporting the legislation. So Social Security did pass with Republican support.   Thirty years later, a significant number of Republicans voted in favor of the Medicare bill. The House adopted the conference report on July 27, 1965, 307-116, with 70 Republicans supporting it. And on July 28, the Senate adopted the final version of the bill by a vote of 70-24, with 13 Republicans in favor of the bill. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Medicare bill into law on July 30, 1965.   But is Dean correct that the Republicans didn't support Medicare until the end?   Donald Ritchie, the associate historian in the U.S. Senate, told us that the Republican support wasn't just a last-minute phenomenon. During the discussion of both bills, ""There were always progressive Republicans and liberal Republicans, some of whom supported Roosevelt and Johnson,"" Ritchie said.   Johnson had the political muscle to pass Medicare because the 1964 elections ushered in 42 new Democrats to the House of Representatives, giving the party a two-thirds majority overall and a larger majority on the Ways and Means Committee, where the legislation would originate. Up until then, many members of the committee, including its Democratic chairman, Wilbur D. Mills, opposed the idea of government-funded health care. In fact, Mills proved a tough sell in 1965 until some of his own pet proposals were added to the legislation. One of those — the addition of a voluntary, supplemental health care plan — had its roots in a Republican alternative bill.   In the House, no Republicans voted for the bill until it reached the floor. It passed the Ways and Means Committee by a party-line vote of 17-8, although the panel's GOP members endorsed some of the bill's non-health care related provisions, according to the 1965  Congressional Quarterly Almanac  .   Likewise, all four Republicans on the House Rules Committee — the panel that sets the boundaries of debate on all bills that come to the House floor — voted against the bill.   In the Senate, however, there was Republican support in the Finance Committee. When the panel cast its final vote, the bill passed 12-5, with four of the committee's eight Republicans supporting it. (President Barack Obama would probably love to get even that much GOP backing.)   So we find Dean is glossing over the details and exaggerating the partisan split. Both Social Security and Medicare were indeed championed by Democrats, but passed with the help of Republican votes. And while some GOP members waited until the last minute to support Medicare, it was backed by half the Republicans on the Senate committee. So we find Dean's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB5E480>],/factchecks/2009/aug/28/howard-dean/dean-claims-social-security-and-medicare-were-pass/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Anthony Weiner']","
Weiner mangles details of health care reform
","
Rep. Anthony Weiner went on the Fox News Channel to offer a spirited defense of House Democrats' plans for health reform, taking questions on the show

Fox & Friends

.
 
Brian Kilmeade, one of the

Fox & Friends

hosts, asked him, ""What if your company who gives you health care insurance, which you know happens more often than not, says: 'You know what? I'm looking at my budget. I'm going to go the public option, because it's cheaper. The quality might not be as good, but when I come to balance my books, I'm still offering my people insurance. The quality is dropped and I save some money.'""
 
""Prohibited under the plan,"" said Weiner, a Democrat from Brooklyn, N.Y. ""Under the plan, for the first five years your employer not only has to keep the coverage, but you can't migrate to the public plan. The concern was we didn't want a giant movement.""
 
Weiner's point that employers can't immediately shift workers to the public option is right. But almost all the other details are wrong.
 
We've read the 1,000-page House bill and there is no rule that employers have to keep coverage for five years, for example. We asked Weiner's office for an explanation and didn't hear back.
 
To examine the rest of his comments, let's recap the basics of the House bill: Employer-provided insurance stays in place. Individuals and small businesses go to a new national health care exchange, where they can comparison shop for health insurance. Private insurers compete on the exchange, but one of the plans is a public option, a low-cost, basic insurance plan offered by the government.
 
During year 1, small businesses with 10 or fewer employees can use the exchange. During the year 2, it's 20 or fewer employees. During year 3, a health choices commissioner has the authority to phase in businesses with more employees. The legislation doesn't say if or when every employer would be allowed on the exchange.
 
The health bill would also set new standards for coverage, requiring insurers to cover basic procedures and adhere to new consumer protection rules.
 
Employer-sponsored insurance will have to meet those same consumer protection rules, but they have a five-year grace period before they have to comply. (See Section 102 on page 17 of the House bill.) So employers can keep their current plans for up to five years before the plans have to conform to the new rules. But there's nothing in the bill that forces them to keep their current coverage. They can change insurance providers just as they do now. Only if they choose to drop coverage would they have to pay an additional tax.
 
Weiner also says, ""you can't migrate to the public plan."" That's true only if you're talking about large employers having access to the exchange. Individuals are allowed to shop on the exchange right away, if they're willing to drop their employer-sponsored coverage. ""You"" might not want to, though: In most cases, employers pay part of their workers' insurance premiums. A worker with a large employer who drops coverage from their job to go to the exchange would lose that contribution.
 
In fact, this point also undermines the premise of Kilmeade's question. He said that if he's an employer, he can ""go the public option, because it's cheaper. The quality might not be as good, but when I come to balance my books, I'm still offering my people insurance."" This is not an accurate description of how employers are allowed to use the exchange.
 
The bill clearly states that employers cannot select a particular insurance plan for their employees on the exchange. (See Section 202, page 81.) The employers can contribute a set amount to help cover their employees, but they can't force their workers to pick the public option if the workers are willing to pay more to get private insurance. So the idea that employers can sign their workers up for the public option to save money is wrong.
 
Getting back to Weiner's statement, he said that an employer has to keep coverage for the first five years. But there's nothing in the legislation that forces companies to keep coverage, although large employers would face a tax penalty if they dropped it altogether.
 
He also says you can't migrate to the public plan. It's true that employers can't force their workers onto the public plan, but individuals can select it if they choose to. The only thing Weiner gets right is that employers can't dump their workers into the public option. Almost all the details are wrong. We rate his statement Barely True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Barbara  Boxer']","
Boxer claims that it costs $1,100 per person to cover the uninsured
","In an effort to sell their health insurance overhaul, Democrats are focusing their pitch on how reform will help the average person. Their latest claim: Health care will actually be cheaper if everyone is insured.
 
To illustrate their point, Democrats are contending that insurance policies are more expensive than they should be because they include a ""hidden health tax"" — an extra charge used to cover the millions of uninsured patients who are treated in the costly emergency room.
 
Barbara Boxer, a Democratic senator from California, talked about that cost on the  Rachel Maddow Show  on Aug. 10, 2009.
 
""They say we have the greatest health care in the world,"" Boxer said. ""Well, the fact is, we pay twice as much and our outcomes aren't as good. We have 48 million people with no health care. As a result, they walk into emergency rooms. It's costing every American who is insured $1,100 to pick up the cost of uncompensated care that goes on at the emergency room."" This is not a new claim. Back on the campaign trail, former candidate Hillary Clinton said each ""family policy has a $900 hidden tax"" because of the cost of the uninsured. We found that her estimate was right, but that was over a year ago. So we thought the claim was worth revisiting.
 
And note the wording difference. Clinton said each ""family policy"" had the hidden cost. But Boxer said ""every American who's insured"" is paying it. We'll explain the significance of that in a minute. When we  checked  Clinton's claim, we relied on a report from consumer health care advocate Families USA that was published in June 2005. The group revisited the issue in May 2009 in a report called ""Hidden Health Tax: Americans Pay a Premium.""
 
The group found that about 86.7 million people were uninsured for some period of time between 2007 and 2008, with about a fourth of those people uninsured for the entire year. The report notes that these estimates were before the recession caused many people to lose their jobs and their health coverage, so the actual numbers are likely to be higher.
 
The report says doctors and hospitals still provide treatment to the uninsured and have to compensate by charging more to insurers. ""In turn, the costs that are shifted to insurers are passed on in the form of higher premiums to consumers and businesses that purchase health coverage.""
 
The practice is otherwise known as cost-shifting. For the insured, that translates to an extra $1,017 for family health care coverage and about $368 per individual policy, according to Families USA.
 
In 2006, the New America Foundation, a left-leaning think tank, looked at the cost of covering the uninsured in California and came up with similar estimates:
 
""We conservatively estimate that about 10 percent of California health care premiums can be attributed to cost-shifting due to the uninsured,"" the report said. ""This means that cost shifting inflates the average annual premium for a California family by $1,186. Individuals purchasing policies pay an additional $455 annual in higher premiums.
 
But a 2008 Kaiser Family Foundation report puts the number much lower than the 10 percent in the California study. It predicted if all private funding for uncompensated care were paid with private insurance payments, it would only amount to 1.7 percent of private insurance premiums. The Kaiser report did not provide a comparable estimate to the $1,186.
 
Kaiser singles out the Families USA study from 2005 and says it is flawed because it doesn't consider a full picture of how doctors and hospitals absorb the costs of the uninsured. And the Kaiser report questions whether cost-shifting is so strongly related to an increase in the number of uninsured. For example, the paper argues that hospitals and insurers would negotiate the same prices for care regardless of the number of uninsured patients. If uncompensated care was affecting these negotiations, its share of hospital costs would go up with the share of the population that is uninsured. But it has not, the report concludes. That brings us back to Boxer's claim. We find it is flawed in two ways. First, she says the cost for ""every American who is insured"" is $1,100. If she had said that was per family as Clinton did, she would be in the ballpark according to the Families USA and New America Foundation studies. But those studies say the cost per  individual  policy was $368 and $468. So she is way off on that count. Secondly, the Kaiser report has raised significant questions about the Families USA study and made a plausible case that much of the cost of the uninsured is absorbed by doctors and hospitals. So in our view that discounts the accuracy of the groups' studies. So we find Boxer's claim Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC862F40>],/factchecks/2009/aug/28/barbara-boxer/boxer-claims-it-costs-1100-person-cover-uninsured/

Limbaugh wrong that Obama is mandating circumcision
","PARENTAL ADVISORY: We don't imagine there are a lot of kids reading PolitiFact, but this item contains explicit language you don't normally see here. Parental discretion is advised.  

A new rap song by the hip-hop artist Jay-Z takes a shot at Rush Limbaugh. But the radio talk show host — referring to the rapper as ""Mr. Z"" — said he was honored to be mentioned.

""Does this, Snerdley, mark a new development in my career to be singled out in a rap song by the famous rapper Jay-Z?"" he said to his call screener on his Aug. 25, 2009, show. ""I guess it is. As far as I know I have never been mentioned in a rap song by anybody. I guess it means I've made it. I'm now in a rap tune by the famous rapper Jay-Z. (The song says) '[T]ell Bill O'Reilly to fall back. Tell Rush Limbaugh to get off my balls.' I would remind the rapper Jay-Z: Mr. Z, it is President Obama who wants to mandate circumcision. We had that story yesterday; and that means if we need to save our penises from anybody, it's Obama. I did not know I was on anybody's balls, either. I'm happy to know that they think I am, though! But I didn't actually know that I was.""
 
It's an issue Limbaugh explored on his Aug. 24 show as well, saying, ""Not that I'm against circumcision, but it's a family's decision. Leave our penises alone, too, Obama!""
 
He cited a Fox News  story  about an upcoming report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that may recommend circumcision for newborn boys as a way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, because studies show that the procedure can reduce transmission of the disease from women to men. The CDC will be discussing what to include in the recommendations at the National HIV Prevention Conference, which is being held in Atlanta this week.

The CDC is still mulling its decision, CDC spokesman Scott Bryan said in an e-mail.
 
""It is important to note that the recommendations are still in development and the CDC has made no determination at this time about the final content,"" he wrote. ""There is a deliberative process for our circumcision recommendations that allows for both external and internal CDC experts to weigh in, followed by a period of public comment after the draft recommendations are published. With respect to infant circumcision, it is important to recognize that many options are still being considered in this process, including simply educating parents about the potential benefits and risks in order to ensure they can make an informed decision.""
 
CDC is also considering whether to recommend circumcision for adult men who are at high risk for HIV infection, Bryan wrote.
 
He emphasized that the recommendations ""will be completely voluntary.""
 
We wondered whether Obama had been involved in the issue and specifically in the CDC's decision to write the guidance, as Limbaugh's claim indicates.
 
We scoured his voting record on  Congressional Quarterly  , his position papers and speeches on  Project Vote Smart  , and even typed ""circumcision"" into the  White House Web site  , and came up with nothing. From what we found, Obama has not used the word ""circumcision"" in any public statement as a candidate or as president. We also found no evidence that he has recommended circumcusion to the CDC.

The only link — and it's an indirect one — that we could find between Obama and the CDC's efforts was a press release on the White House Web site announcing a series of HIV/AIDS community discussions, the first one being held in conjunction with the National HIV Prevention Conference we mentioned earlier. But the release did not mention circumcision.

It turns out that circumcision recommendations have been under discussion since 2007, when George W. Bush was president. Given the fact the CDC was pondering the idea back then, it is no more accurate to say Obama wants to mandate circumcision than to say Bush did.
 
So, back to Limbaugh's claim. He says Obama ""wants to mandate circumcision."" But the CDC's eventual recommendations — if they even include circumcision — will be voluntary, not mandatory. In addition, we could we find no connection between Obama and the new guidance, and no evidence that Obama had even used the word in a public forum. In fact, the recommendations were under discussion long before Obama took office.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Tom Coburn']","
Coburn says 20 percent of every Medicare dollar goes to fraud
","On the Aug. 24 edition of Fox News Channel's  On the Record With Greta Van Susteren  , Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. — an ob-gyn who has taken a leading position against Democratic health care reform efforts — took aim at Medicare fraud.   The senator said, ""If you look at Medicare and Medicaid, both vital programs today, they're highly inefficient. People claim that they're efficient. Medicare has at least $80 billion worth of fraud a year. That's a full 20 percent of every dollar that's spent on Medicare goes to fraud. And Medicaid is not much better. We don't actually have the numbers because half the states aren't reporting their Medicaid fraud. So when you have programs that are designed to be defrauded, even though they're well-intended and they are helping people, we ought to think about how do we get better value for that money and less money going out the door. ""   In this item, we'll focus on Coburn's estimate that there is $80 billion in Medicare fraud annually.   After speaking to health care experts and searching on the Internet, we found that while Medicare fraud is a notable concern, statistics offered to document the scale of the problem are slippery at best. On May 6, 2009, Daniel Levinson, the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, testified before the Senate Special Committee on Aging that ""it is not possible to measure precisely the extent of fraud in Medicare and Medicaid.""   As a result, estimates of fraud in the system vary — widely.   The number Levinson offered lawmakers is one from the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association. Levinson said that the NHCAA — whose members include private insurance companies and government agencies — estimated that ""at least 3 percent — or more than $60 billion each year — is lost to fraud."" But as Levinson was careful to note, the $60 billion figure covers fraud in all U.S. health care expenditures — not just in Medicare, which would mean that Coburn is way off in his estimate.   But before drawing any conclusions, we turned to the NHCAA for more background on that figure, which is, to be exact, $68 billion.   Louis Saccoccio, the NHCAA's executive director, told PolitiFact that the 3 percent estimate is calculated from the experiences of the private insurers who belong to his group. But he emphasized that it is indeed an estimate, and a conservative one at that. ""No one has a hard number,"" he said, ""because you can't go out with a survey and ask, 'How much are you robbing from Medicare?'""   Another prominent figure in the field, Malcolm Sparrow, argues that estimates in the range of 3 percent are low — ""ridiculously low,"" he put it in an interview. Sparrow, a onetime fraud investigator and detective chief inspector with the British police service, is now a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.   Sparrow agrees with Saccoccio that no one has put together an accurate accounting of Medicare fraud. But he argues that the kind of errors detected by current control systems are primarily technical glitches — not the products of criminal minds setting out to defraud the system. And given that Medicare offers a large pot of money, a high degree of automation in its claims-paying process and limited auditing capabilities, he argues, the program is a godsend for dedicated con artists.   ""Criminals, who are intent on stealing as much as they can and as fast as possible, and who are prepared to fabricate diagnoses, treatments, even entire medical episodes, have a relatively easy time breaking through all the industry's defenses,"" Sparrow testified before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs on May 20, 2009. ""The criminals' advantage is that they are willing to lie. And provided they learn to submit their bills correctly, they remain free to lie. The rule for criminals is simple: If you want to steal from Medicare, or Medicaid, or any other health care insurance program, learn to bill your lies correctly. Then, for the most part, your claims will be paid in full and on time, without a hiccup, by a computer, and with no human involvement at all.""   His evidence is anecdotal but suggestive. In a recent academic paper, Sparrow noted that then-FBI Director Louis Freeh testified in 1995 that cocaine traffickers in Florida and California were switching from drug dealing to health care fraud because they discovered that health care fraud was safer, easier and more lucrative than the drug trade, and that it carried a smaller risk of detection. In 1997, Sparrow added, the  New York Times  reported that organized crime families in New York City and New Jersey were abandoning extortion and bid-rigging in favor of new criminal enterprises such as health insurance fraud. Usually, he writes, major frauds are uncovered by whistleblowers rather than audit systems. One example is the case of Columbia HCA, a major hospital chain that in 2003 agreed to a $1.7 billion settlement with the Justice Department after 10 years of investigations initiated by whistleblower allegations.   Sparrow also points to suits under the federal False Claims Act as evidence of a major fraud problem in the health care sector. The False Claims Act allows citizens to allege the existence of defrauding the government and then reap a share of the government's savings once the improprieties are rooted out. False Claims Act suits against HHS now account for a large majority of all such suits filed annually. ""There is apparently no other area of federal spending so vulnerable to fraud, and so deeply infected,"" Sparrow writes.   Sparrow testified that because HHS audit procedures do not dig very deep, ""we now have no reliable indications of the overall fraud loss rates for the Medicare program."" (A spokeswoman for the HHS Inspector General's Office declined to comment on Sparrow's analysis.)   Now, back to Coburn's assertion. When we called his office, his staff told us that his source for the comment was an article in the  National Review  , a conservative magazine. The July 15, 2009, article said of Sparrow, ""He thinks that as much as 20 percent of the federal health care budget is consumed by fraud, which would be $85 billion a year for Medicare."" That's pretty close to what Coburn said on Van Susteren's show.   But is the senator right? It depends on whether you trust NHCAA or Sparrow.   Total Medicare outlays were $431 billion in 2007, or 19 percent of total national health care expenditures. If one assumes that fraud is equally prevalent in Medicare and other types of health care, that would make the Medicare share of the NHCAA's $68 billion fraud estimate $13 billion. And $13 billion in fraud divided by $431 billion in total Medicare outlays would be 3 percent of total Medicare expenditures — a far cry from Coburn's 20 percent. (A rate of 20 percent is ""possible, but I don't think it's very plausible,"" Saccoccio said.)   Skeptical that Medicare is only being defrauded at rates equal to the private sector? Let's triple that number to $39 billion in fraud. If you do that, it still comes out to 9 percent — less than half of what Coburn asserted it was.   In the meantime, Coburn's dollar figure — $80 billion in fraud — would be no more accurate if the NHCAA is right. The group says there's $68 billion in fraud in all health care expenditures — but Coburn's figure for Medicare alone is bigger than that.   However, by Sparrow's analysis, Coburn could indeed be in the ballpark. In an interview, Sparrow himself said the Coburn estimate is ""perfectly plausible."" He added that Coburn ""doesn't know any more than you or I do.""   Because of the uncertainty about how much Medicare fraud actually exists, we think Coburn oversteps when he states definitively that ""Medicare has at least $80 billion worth of fraud a year."" Not only is there a statistical disagreement over how big the problem currently is, but all the key players also agree that there are simply no good data to rely on. Still, because Coburn's estimate is considered plausible by a leading academic in the field, we can't dismiss it as undeniably false. We rate Coburn's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC003A00>],/factchecks/2009/aug/27/tom-coburn/coburn-says-20-percent-every-medicare-dollar-goes-/

Earlier, he said in a Jan. 7, 2013, PBS ""Newshour"" interview: ""If you look at the jurisdictions with the strictest gun control laws, almost without exception, they have the highest crime rates and the highest murder rates.""

Is that so?

PolitiFact checked a similar statement in February 2011, when National Rifle Association leader Wayne LaPierre said that ""violent crime in jurisdictions that recognize the right to carry (firearms for personal protection) is lower than in areas that prevent it.""

LaPierre’s claim was rated False. After looking at information from interest groups, a federal research center and the FBI, PolitiFact concluded, ""We don't see any evidence that state gun laws correlate with violent crime rates one way or the other."" 
We asked Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton for backup on the senator’s statement. He emailed us links to news stories, commentary pieces and research.

The material most directly related to the Cruz claim -- that stricter laws coincide with higher murder/crime rates -- boiled down to: 
By phone, Rushton singled out research by Lott, an economist and author of ""More Guns, Less Crime,"" which concluded that crime rates dropped in U.S. states and counties after ""right to carry"" laws were passed. PolitiFact mentioned Lott’s work in its LaPierre fact-check, but also noted it had been contradicted by other research, such as a 2004 review in which the National Research Council of the National Academies of science, engineering and medicine concluded data available at the time did not show any ""link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime.""

Cruz’s materials covered a range of ""jurisdictions"" from local to international, but gave limited or case-by-case evidence rather than comprehensive or across-the-board comparisons.

They also illustrated a significant issue regarding such claims: Plenty of gun/crime research is out there, but with so many variables that comparisons are difficult.

One example: A Dec. 14, 2012, Washington Post blog entry said economist Richard Florida found that ""states with tighter gun-control laws appear to have fewer gun-related deaths."" Sounds like it disproves Cruz’s claim, right?

Well, but: Cruz specified crime and murder rates; Florida’s basis was the rate of firearm deaths (not limited to crime, thus including suicides and accidents). Cruz and the Post both talked about tight gun laws, but Cruz’s claim was not specific (Rushton later said he meant gun bans) while Florida identified states as ""stricter"" if they had any one of three specific gun laws (assault weapon ban, trigger lock law or safe storage requirement).

In other words, gun/crime data can be used to construct statements that appear to prove diametrically opposed points.  

Another big caveat: Just because two conditions crop up together (i.e., they correlate) doesn’t mean one caused the other. Many firearms studies and news stories we reviewed included a statement to that effect -- and then went ahead and plunked down the stats together anyway.

And all that’s before you get to the issue of whether political bias has affected the research.
  
Cruz’s claim is bold: Strict laws ""almost without exception"" correlate with the ""highest"" crime and murder rates, he said.

Seeking a common-sense way to test that, we compared state-by-state FBI crime statistics, as PolitiFact did in 2011. State laws cover a lot of territory, because local gun laws can’t be stricter than state laws in most of the U.S., according to the NRA-ILA and Florida State University criminology professor Gary Kleck, who spoke with us via email.

To determine states which had the tightest gun laws, we looked at three tallies: one each from the NRA and two gun-control advocacy groups, the Washington-based Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

Kleck pointed us to the NRA’s ""Compendium of State Firearms Laws,"" which showed 11 states with four or more restrictions as of July 9, 2010. Nine of those made the Top Ten on Brady’s 2011 gun-law scorecard and the Law Center’s list of ""10 states with the strongest gun laws.""

The nine: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island.

We charted crime and murder rates per 100,000 residents for those states using the FBI’s most recent complete Uniform Crime Reports: 2011. 

The FBI discourages using its crime report data to create rankings, and in any case our method here is flawed. Kleck and Lott described for us how a ""cross-sectional"" study like this -- checking many places at one point in time -- misses history that might be relevant; for example, information on whether local crime was already high or low before a gun law passed. 
Looking at states also excludes two Cruz-proferred examples: Washington, D.C., and Chicago. National Public Radio reporter Carrie Johnson summarized those situations in a Jan. 18, 2013, broadcast: 
""There were two places in the country ... that still had sweeping bans on handguns. They were Chicago and Washington, D.C. But the Supreme Court in a pair of cases in 2008 and 2010 threw out those sweeping bans, so no more outright bans on handgun ownership in these places, but still some pretty tight restrictions. It's worth noting … homicide rates for D.C. are at record or near-record lows as of 2012, but Chicago had a sharp spike in murders last year."" 

We took the U.S. Census’ 25 largest cities as of July 1, 2011, and looked at their 2011 FBI statistics. Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Memphis, Tenn., each had higher murder rates than D.C. and Chicago. Crime rates did not compare as neatly, because Chicago’s data for rape (and thus for total violent crime) are excluded for reporting differences. Though property crime rate isn’t a perfect substitute in a discussion about guns and the law, we checked anyway and found that D.C. had the 12th and Chicago the 14th highest property crime rates among the 25 biggest cities.

Going from the micro level to the macro: International comparisons are tricky because many factors vary, from data collection methods to countries’ cultural backgrounds. Laws aren’t uniform either, said Sarah Parker, a co-author of the annual Small Arms Study compiled by the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland.

By email, Parker named a few countries with some of the strictest gun controls: Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom.

We checked United Nations homicide rates for 2008 in 187 countries, which ranged from 61.3 murders per 100,000 citizens in Honduras down to zero murders in Palau, Iceland and Monaco. Among the ""strict"" nations that Parker suggested, four were low (UK, 1.3 murders per 100,000; Australia, 1.2; Japan, 0.5; Singapore, 0.4) and one was high -- 10th overall, in fact (South Africa, 36.8).

Our ruling

Cruz said that ""almost without exception,"" locales with the tightest gun laws have the highest crime and murder rates.

This point might hold for some places. However, we found multiple exceptions -- among cities, states and nations -- making this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC690200>],/factchecks/2013/feb/01/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-jurisdictions-strictest-gun-laws-hav/

When it comes to lottery tickets, not losing is winning
","
Today could be the day! -- or so says the Georgia Lottery.

Since June 1993, when the Georgia Lottery began selling tickets, bettors have waited with bated breath as chipper TV  announcers called out winning Powerball numbers. Players schedule their waking lives around the twice-daily drawings for Cash 3 winnings.

And ticket buyers have left mounds of scratch-off shavings on convenience store counters across the state in hopes of scoring a win. 

But the prize for those scratch-off games may not be the cash haul that most gamers hope for. Instead, today could be the day you win ... another ticket!.

One of PolitiFact Georgia’s readers, Bob Lynn, sent us a message, questioning the lottery’s claims about the scratch-off games. 

Lynn’s concern was this: The lottery counts awarding another ticket as a ""win."" He said the face value of a ticket (""winning"" $2 on a ticket you bought that cost $2, for example) is not a win. That exchange, he said, is just breaking even. It’s a draw.

And more importantly, he said, by including another ticket or the face value of a ticket as ""wins,"" the Georgia Lottery is overstating its odds of winning for each game.

We decided to double-down on our lottery sources and take a serious look at the numbers game. Are these types of prizes considered ""wins"" by the lottery? And are the odds of winning skewed by claiming these types of prizes as ""wins""?

The lottery is big business for the state, with optimistic players taking chances in games with creative titles such as ""Red, Hot and Wild 7’s,"" ""Classy Loot,"" ""Refund Check"" and ""Solid Gold.""

Since the first ticket was sold almost 20 years ago, the lottery has rung up  $45 billion (yes, billion) in sales. About $14 billion has gone to Georgia’s pre-kindergarten program and HOPE scholarships for college students.

On average, the Georgia Lottery offers 40 to 45 scratch-off games at any given time and has nine online, or computerized, games, according to the lottery’s website. 

Detailed odds for every prize level in every Georgia Lottery game are available on the lottery website, a lottery spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. The prize levels include a free ticket. The odds for each game that involves a drawing are also printed on the back of each game’s play slip. The overall odds of winning a prize in instant games are printed on every game ticket. The odds include every prize level available in each game. 

So transparency is not a problem.

Lynn, our lottery-playing reader, has spent thousands of dollars on lottery tickets over the past two decades. He’s well aware of the odds listed on the back. 

One of the scratch-off games he plays, Monopoly Millionaire, for example, lists the overall odds of winning  as 1 in 3.27. There are 20 different ways to win on the $10 Monopoly Millionaire ticket, according to the printed advertisement. 

As all gamers know, playing carries risk, he said. But ""any respectable gambler knows that winning another ticket is not getting ahead. And in my opinion it’s deceitful to include these as wins.""

The Georgia Lottery explains it this way: There are multiple top-prize-winning tickets, as well as multiple prize levels (from free tickets to top cash prizes) available in all Georgia Lottery instant games. Players can win prizes, including cash or ticket prizes, in accordance with the rules of each instant game, said Tandi Reddick, the lottery’s communications director.

David Gale, executive director of the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, a lottery trade group, says claiming a ticket or the face value of a ticket as a ""win"" is common practice among state lotteries. And so is including them in stated odds, he said.

What’s the reasoning behind this?

""Gambling is defined as taking a chance with something of value, and that something can be money or a car or a lottery ticket because it is an item that has some concrete value,"" said Adam Goodie, the director of the Center for Gambling Research and the Georgia Decision Lab at the University of Georgia. The Center for Gambling Research, started in August 2012, is an independent facility not associated with the Georgia Lottery or any other state lottery. The CGR brings together researchers from diverse disciplines for research and continuing education and training on the diverse effects of gambling activity, according to its website.

And because those tickets and face value prizes are included in the odds numbers, excluding them would indeed change the numbers, Goodie said. 

For example, take a scratch-off game with odds of winning listed at 1 in 3.98, he said. In other words, for every 398 tickets sold, 100 are winners.
Let’s say 40 of those 100 tickets ""win"" their owners a free ticket. If you exclude them from the odds, a player’s chances drop to about 1 in 6 or 7, Goodie said.

PolitiFact Georgia also talked to several hard-core Georgia Lottery scratch-off players. They all agreed that getting a free ticket should be considered a win. Their reasoning was a bit cynical and went something like this: You generally expect to get hosed when you play the lottery. If you don’t, due to a free ticket, you are ahead of the game. A winner. Sort of. 

So how do we rule on this one, and what are the odds? 

A Politifact Georgia reader, Bob Lynn, says the Georgia Lottery is being ""deceitful"" by claiming prizes of another ticket or the face value of a ticket as ""wins."" Claiming these prizes as ""wins"" overstates the published odds of winning for each game, he says.

These prizes may not count for Lynn, but they sure do for lottery experts, other lottery players and the Georgia Lottery. A free ticket is considered an item of material value, and it is therefore inherently considered a prize, just like cash, a car or any other prize offered by the gaming operator. 

The Georgia Lottery’s stated odds printed on the Monopoly Millionaire instant game are accurate.

We give the lottery a True on this one. And we wish Lynn better luck next time.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC62B780>],/factchecks/2013/feb/01/georgia-lottery/when-it-comes-lottery-tickets-not-losing-winning/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Pundits', 'Rush Limbaugh']","
Rush Limbaugh says immigrants come to U.S. seeking prosperity from government
","Florida Sen. Marco Rubio talked immigration recently with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, steering into an interesting side issue: why people come to the U.S.

""You look at people that come from Latin America. They come to get away from stale, stagnant economies where the rich keep winning and everybody else keeps working for them because big government dominates those economies,"" Rubio said.

To which Limbaugh responded: ""Well, is that the reason that a majority of immigrants come to this country today? I know it used to be. They wanted to be Americans. They wanted to escape oppression. They wanted to become citizens of the greatest country on earth. I've seen a number of research, scholarly research data which says that a vast majority of arriving immigrants today come here because they believe that government is the source of prosperity, and that's what they support.""

Here, we’ll look into Limbaugh’s assertion that belief in an expansive central government is what draws people to our shores.

Polling Hispanics

We did not hear back from Limbaugh’s show, but we suspect that the research he referred to is a 2012 Pew Research Hispanic Center poll, asking Hispanics about their political ideology. The poll broke down the results by generation, so it’s possible to distinguish first-generation Hispanics (i.e., immigrants) from U.S.-born Hispanics.

The poll, which queried 1,220 Latino respondents ages 18 and older, asked, ""Would you rather have a smaller government providing fewer services, or a bigger government providing more services?"" In the results, 75 percent of Hispanics said they preferred bigger government (compared with 41 percent of the general population.)

A breakdown by generation showed an even greater skew: Among first-generation Hispanics (i.e., immigrants), 81 percent favored bigger government. In the second generation, 72 percent favored bigger government, and the figure fell to 58 percent in the third generation and higher.

Steven Camarota, with the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter immigration laws, pointed us to another Pew poll asking people’s opinions of socialism, capitalism and libertarianism. Among blacks, whites and Hispanics, Hispanics had the most unfavorable view of capitalism: 55 percent. Overall, 50 percent had a favorable view of capitalism, while 40 percent had an unfavorable view.)

In Camarota’s view, ""the general sentiment (of Limbaugh’s statement) seems to be right that a very large fraction -- of Hispanics anyway -- show a very strong sentiment toward what could be called progressive or liberal views of government.""

But that’s just Hispanics, and Limbaugh simply referred to ""a vast majority of arriving immigrants.""

Camarota cited similar figures about Asian immigrants, also from Pew polling. In a 2012 survey, 57 percent of foreign-born Asians in the U.S. said they prefer a bigger government that provides more services, while 33 percent want a smaller government providing fewer services.

So there is evidence that recent immigrants, at least among Hispanics and Asians, favor more government, which could reasonably be construed as a belief that ""government is the source of prosperity,"" as Limbaugh said.

But is that belief the reason people immigrate?

Jobs & family

Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute, dismissed Limbaugh’s claim as off-base.

""If Rush Limbaugh was right, we would not have people leaving during a recession like we did,"" Nowrasteh said in an interview. ""About a million unauthorized immigrants have gone home to their home countries because there are no jobs for them here.""

A separate study by the Cato Institute says ""immigrants come to America today to build a better life through work, not welfare, just as they have throughout American history."" It backs up this point with U.S. Department of Labor data on labor force participation. Among foreign-born people, the work rate was 67.9 percent in 2010, compared to the native-born rate of 64.1 percent.

It’s worth noting that welfare benefits are generally not available to immigrants. Illegal immigrants, of course, cannot receive public services such as cash assistance or Medicaid at all, and legal immigrants aren’t eligible for five years. Other programs are totally inaccessible until they become citizens.

""Undoubtedly, there are undocumented immigrants getting some of those things. But they are  for the most part not eligible,"" said Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center.

Immigration patterns indicate that that ""source of prosperity"" isn’t what immigrants seek anyway.

""Immigrants go to states that have smaller benefits for welfare recipients,"" Nowrasteh said. ""They go to the states that have the fastest-growing economies. If they were coming for welfare, they’d go to the places with the biggest welfare states.""

A wide-ranging international survey by Gallup of people all over the globe found that 150 million adults worldwide would like to migrate to the U.S., making it by far the top desired destination. ""Opportunity"" was the most common reason given, meaning ""the chance to join family members who are already in other countries, to start a new business, to express one's views without fear, or to live where children are treated with respect.""

Gallup also found that the human development index of the country of origin was a significant factor too. That index measures citizens’ health, life expectancy, schooling options and wealth. The poll found that the desire to migrate ""tends to be higher in countries with medium to low human development.""

Our ruling

Limbaugh said research shows that ""a vast majority of arriving immigrants today come here because they believe that government is the source of prosperity, and that's what they support.""

Surveys of Hispanic and Asian immigrants show that majorities of immigrants favor bigger government, which could be the ""source of prosperity"" Limbaugh meant. But we could find no research to say that those views are what drive people to immigrate. Family connections and job opportunities in the U.S. are the most common reasons cited in studies.

Limbaugh’s claim contains a grain of truth but makes a misleading causal connection. That fits our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAC1440>],/factchecks/2013/jan/31/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-says-immigrants-come-us-seeking-prosperit/

Stephen King says since Australia cracked down on guns, homicides by gun dropped 60 percent
","
Author Stephen King once asked his publisher to pull one of his novels off the shelves.

Six people had died  — in real life.

Four boys in 10 years brought guns to school. One killed a teacher and two students. Another shot five members of a prayer group, killing three. All four teenagers had read Rage, a book King wrote when he was a teen himself and published under another name.

King, in a blunt, impassioned essay, wrote that when he learned of the copycat crimes, he wanted the book off the market. He argues the United States should do the same for assault weapons.

""You don’t leave a can of gasoline where a boy with firebug tendencies can lay hands on it,"" he said in the 25-page piece, published Jan. 25, 2013, for Amazon Kindle readers.

King, a Democrat who says he owns three handguns and supports the Second Amendment, argues stricter gun control ""would save thousands of lives."" (His earnings from the sale of the essay will go the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.) He says Australia shows it’s possible.

In 1996, 28-year-old Martin Bryant shot and killed 35 people near the Port Arthur historic site, a popular tourist destination. After the shootings, the country banned and bought up automatic and semi-automatic long guns, destroying at least 600,000 in 12 months — ultimately about a third of its privately owned guns.

It worked, King argues.

""Since the (Martin) Bryant killings and the resulting tough gun laws, homicides by firearm have declined almost 60 percent in Australia. The guns-for-everyone advocates hate that statistic, and dispute it, but as Bill Clinton likes to say, it's not opinion. It's arithmetic, honey.""

He likes talking to ""honey."" He also drops a few F-bombs.

We wanted to know: Have homicides by firearm in Australia dropped almost 60 percent? And did those ""tough gun laws"" do it?

 ‘It’s arithmetic, honey’

We asked King and Australian and American experts in gun violence for evidence.

By a few different measures, the arithmetic works. Homicides by firearm did decline after 1996 — in fact, had already been in decline.

One path to ""almost 60 percent"" comes from statistics compiled in part by Philip Alpers, a public health professor at the University of Sydney. The number of gun homicides fell from 69 in 1996 (excluding the 35 victims of the mass shooting prompting the laws) to 30 in 2012.  

That’s a decrease of 56.5 percent.

(And, yes, you read those numbers right — we didn’t miss any zeros. The United States has about the same number of gun homicides every day as happened in Australia last year.)

Then there’s King’s source, an item from Slate.com, he told us. It was a blog post citing a blog post citing a study —  a reputable peer-reviewed piece in the American Law and Economics Review.

The researchers, Andrew Leigh of Australian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University, found that in the decade after the gun laws, firearm homicides dropped 59 percent.

So, on the numbers, King has strong support.

But did the 1996 laws drive the numbers? That’s more vexing.

""He could be right. Or he could be wrong,"" said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center who wrote a helpful 2011 summary of the evidence. "" … The true answer is, we really don't know.""

Leigh and Neill designed their study to test for the law’s effect. They asked whether death rates dropped more in states that destroyed relatively more banned weapons through gun buybacks.

They found the buyback program drove down firearm suicides by almost 80 percent, with no significant change in suicides that didn’t use guns. But the effect on homicides, while of ""similar magnitude,"" was less precise, they wrote — perhaps between 35 and 50 percent.

Two other studies, which Hemenway described as flawed, found the laws made little difference.  But their design made it nearly impossible to find an effect, he argues.

The first, authored by members of the Australian gun lobby, highlighted the fact that before the law passed, the firearm homicide rate was already dropping. If it had continued on that track, they found, that would explain the entire change — showing the law made no difference. The authors cherry-picked a high year for homicides to start their analysis, then assumed deaths would drop at the same linear rate forever — with negative deaths by 2015.

The second study was more sophisticated. Authors searched for a shift in deaths in a single year that might be attributed to the law, and found their tests suggested the law didn’t ""have any large effects on reducing firearm homicide or suicide rates."" Hemenway answers that the buyback occurred over two calendar years, in 1996 and 1997 — and the two-year drop was substantial. Gun homicides fell 46 percent.

Australian experts told us the science leans King’s way. But it’s not yet definitive.

""The truth is that gun homicide did decline substantially after the toughening of Australia's gun laws and the massive gun buyback,"" said Don Weatherburn, director of the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research. ""The complication is that gun homicide was coming down before any of this. The academic debate is about whether the downward trend accelerated.""

His own view? That there’s some evidence that tougher gun laws reduced the homicide rate, but it is ""far from conclusive.""

Paul Mazerolle, director of the Violence Research and Prevention Program at Griffith University in Brisbane, echoed that ""more definitive work is required.""

Some feel more certain the laws did their job.

Simon Chapman, a professor of public health at the University of Sydney, co-authored a 2006 study showing faster falls in firearm deaths after the laws.

""Six years on, there still has not been a massacre,"" he told PolitiFact.

But an even messier question is whether similar laws would work in the United States. Australia doesn’t have domestic gun manufacturers —  and has the benefit of being, you know, an island. Guns destroyed aren’t so easily replaced.

 Our ruling

King, urging his readers to support an American assault weapons ban, said that since Australia passed tough gun laws, ""homicides by firearm have declined almost 60 percent."" The raw numbers back him up — but cause and effect are much peskier questions. Scholars we spoke with say the evidence leans King’s way, but is less than conclusive. That’s an important clarification. We rate King’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE45600>],/factchecks/2013/jan/31/stephen-king/stephen-king-says-australia-cracked-down-guns-homi/

Calling on citizens to get gun training, Milwaukee County sheriff says response to crime calls slowed by layoffs
","
When Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. called on citizens to learn to use guns to defend themselves, he said fewer cops on the street meant that ""simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option."" 
The same day, Jan. 25, 2013, he elaborated on the radio spot. He told conservative talk show host Vicki McKenna on WISN-AM (1130) in Milwaukee: 
""We need a new model. We're still operating -- when I say we, in law enforcement -- are operating under an old model that was actually developed in the 1980s. It was called rapid response. Law enforcement officials convinced city leaders to spend a lot of money hiring new officers and they promised that they could get to calls quickly; that's why it was called the rapid response model. 
""And the elected officials, they went along with it and there was this big hiring of police officers that went on in the ’80s. And there were, at that time, there were enough people to get to calls in a reasonable period of time. 
""Well since then, obviously, budgets, budget considerations -- cops have been laid off, fewer dollars going into public safety; my own agency, I had to lay off 48 people last year."" 
So, are there 48 fewer sheriff’s deputies responding to urgent crime calls? 
Most laid off were rehired 
Clarke’s 30-second public service announcement made national news. He did TV interviews on CNN, Fox and again on CNN, as well as a radio interview with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity. He repeated his claim about layoffs, though he used a smaller figure than the 48 he cited in the McKenna interview. 
Clarke refused our request to back up for his claim about 48 layoffs. 
We went to the files. 
Because of a budget cut imposed by Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, Clarke was forced to do 48 layoffs in February 2012, according to a news article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. At the time, Clarke’s spokeswoman said no decisions had been made on whether any tasks of the sheriff's office would be curtailed. 
Seven months later, Clarke said he was rehiring 29 of the deputies because staffing at the county jail was dangerously low. 
There was no mention of lacking deputies to respond to urgent calls about crime. 
The number actually rehired as of October 2012 was 25, according to a list provided by Abele’s office. 
It’s important to note that while the 48 layoffs number was correct, Clarke presented it as if that number was what was currently having a detriment on response times. That is, as if it was the situation as it exists today. It does not, given that more than half of the layoffs have been restored. 
What’s more, the indication is that the layoffs were in jail positions, not among deputies who may be called on to respond to serious crimes. 
Role of sheriff 
Even if the layoffs affected deputies who respond to serious crimes, the fact is the Sheriff’s Office handles only a small percentage of such calls in Milwaukee County. 
The Sheriff’s Office runs two jails, patrols freeways and provides security for the airport, the courthouse and other facilities. But in terms of crime fighting, its territory is generally limited to properties owned by the county, such as parks. Milwaukee County is heavily urbanized and municipalities have their own police departments that respond to crime calls. 
In 2010, according to the state Office of Justice Assistance, the Sheriff’s Office responded to just 10 violent crimes. That jumped to 163 in 2011. But the 163 represented just 2 percent of the 7,380 violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault) reported throughout the county in 2011. 
Similarly, the Sheriff’s Office handled 224 property crimes (burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, arson) in 2011. That was up from 28 in 2010, but comprised less than 1 percent of the 43,615 property crimes in the county. 
Suffice it to say: If a person in Milwaukee County calls 911 about a serious crime in progress, in the vast majority of cases, a police officer and not a sheriff’s deputy would respond. So, again, the linkage Clarke makes between the layoffs and response times falls flat. 
Our rating 
Clarke said: ""I had to lay off 48 people last year,"" which has exacerbated the lack of law enforcement officers in the county that respond quickly to crime calls. 
The Sheriff’s Office did lay off 48 people in 2012, but most have been rehired. Moreover, the office handles only a fraction of serious crimes in Milwaukee. 
We rate Clarke’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE47140>],/factchecks/2013/jan/31/david-clarke-jr/calling-citizens-get-gun-training-milwaukee-county/

Hurricane Sandy damaged an area representing about 10 percent of the nation’s economy, congressman says
","
Calling on House members this month to approve federal aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen offered his colleagues a national lens to view the destruction: the damaged area accounts for about 10 percent of the nation’s economy.

The Republican congressman made that point during a Jan. 15 debate that ended with the GOP-controlled House signing off on roughly $50 billion in emergency aid for Sandy victims.

The bulk of that funding was based on an amendment sponsored by Frelinghuysen to provide about $33 billion in additional aid. In his speech on the House floor, the congressman argued that providing the disaster relief made economic sense.

""Mister Chairman, the area damaged by Hurricane Sandy represents roughly 10 percent of our nation's economy,"" said Frelinghuysen (R-11th Dist.). ""It makes good sense, economic and fiscal, to get our region back on its feet as soon as it can.""

Steve Wilson, a senior policy adviser to Frelinghuysen, told us the statement was in reference to the combined gross domestic product, or GDP, in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

We found that the combined GDP in those three states was about $1.875 trillion in 2011, marking about 12.5 percent of the national GDP, according to figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The 2011 figures represent the most recent data available.

But that roughly 12.5 percent figure doesn’t fully support Frelinghuysen’s statement.

The congressman referred to ""the area damaged by Hurricane Sandy,"" but the combined GDP applies to the entirety of those three states. In other words, Frelinghuysen’s figure includes parts of those states that were not damaged in the storm, including most of New York.

The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis does not release GDP estimates at the county level, so we can’t measure the combined GDP for the specific counties damaged in the storm. The bureau releases GDP’s by metropolitan statistical area, but they can’t be viewed as a percentage of the national GDP.

In response to our findings, Wilson argued in an e-mail that ""areas of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut far beyond Sandy’s ‘bullseye’ were deeply affected by the storm.""

""Two and a half million people in New Jersey alone lost power, many for two weeks, as did large and small businesses, municipal and county governments. A crippling fuel shortage forced the imposition of odd-even gasoline rationing,"" Wilson said. ""New Jersey Transit, which serves tens of tens of thousands of commuters, ground to a halt. As a result, residents of undamaged areas were unable to get to their place of employment.""

""To ignore these facts is to underestimate Sandy’s devastating effects on residents up and down New Jersey, New York and Connecticut,"" Wilson added.

About three months since Hurricane Sandy made landfall near Atlantic City, the Democrat-led Senate on Monday approved the roughly $50 billion in emergency aid, and President Barack Obama signed the bill on Tuesday.

Earlier in January, Obama signed a bill passed by Congress to provide $9.7 billion for the National Flood Insurance Program to assist Sandy victims.

Our ruling

During a Jan. 15 debate over approving federal aid for Hurricane Sandy victims, Frelinghuysen said on the House floor that ""the area damaged by Hurricane Sandy represents roughly 10 percent of our nation's economy.""

But the congressman’s figure applies to a territory much larger than what was damaged in the storm. The statistic represents the combined gross domestic product in all of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and thus includes areas that were untouched by Sandy.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

"['Education', 'Texas', 'Thomas Lindsay']","
Thomas Lindsay says 43 percent of college grades are A's, up 28 percentage points from 1960
","
More than 4 in 10 college grades are A’s and that’s way up from 50 years ago, Thomas K. Lindsay of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation recently wrote.

In a Jan. 12, 2013, opinion column in the Austin American-Statesman, Lindsay prefaced his claim by saying students study less than they once did.

""Worse, grades during this period have, paradoxically, increased. Approximately 43 percent of all college grades today are A’s, an increase of 28 percentage points since 1960,"" Lindsay said.

We're not delving into how much students study. 
But a reader urged us to check on A’s over the decades.

Lindsay, director of the foundation’s Center for Higher Education, soon pointed us to a July 14, 2011, New York Times blog post summarizing a study of grades awarded at colleges and universities over the past several decades.

""Most recently, about 43 percent of all letter grades given were A’s, an increase of 28 percentage points since 1960 and 12 percentage points since 1988,"" the blog post says. ""The distribution of B’s has stayed relatively constant; the growing share of A’s instead comes at the expense of a shrinking share of C’s, D’s and F’s. In fact, only about 10 percent of grades awarded are D’s and F’s.""

According to the post, ""private colleges and universities are by far the biggest offenders on grade inflation,"" with A’s and B’s representing 73 percent of all grades awarded at public schools by the end of last decade, and 86 percent of all grades awarded at private schools.

The cited study was conducted by Stuart Rojstaczer, a former Duke University geophysics professor, and Christopher Healy, an associate professor of computer science at Furman University in South Carolina.

To our inquiry, Rojstaczer guided us to an online copy of the study, which said that grades in recent years were compiled from web searches, other studies and information from 135 colleges and universities, including ""mostly continuous data"" from 14 schools covering the 1960s or earlier to the 2000s.

For the early 1960s, 11 to 13 schools were ""represented by our national averages,"" the study says.

In 1960, the study says, C was the most common grade nationwide and D’s and F’s accounted for more grades, combined, than A’s. By 1965, though, ""B had supplanted C as the most common grade, and D’s and F’s were becoming increasingly less common.""

""From the early 1960s to the mid-1970s, grades rose rapidly across the nation, and A became the second most common grade awarded,"" the study says. After a dip in A’s in the 1970s into the early 1980s, the study says, from 1984 to the mid-2000s, the proportion of A’s increased by a factor of 1.5. ""By 2008, A’s were nearly three times more common than they were in 1960,"" the study says.

""For the 135 schools in our database with contemporary data, A’s are handed out 43% of the time on average,"" the study says.

We sought more information on the A’s from 1960.

By email, Healy told us the data referring to 1960 may have included information from the years 1959 and 1961 since for a given college, the researchers could have had data for one year but not the next. As of late January 2013, he said, he had grade information for that period from 16 institutions, up from 14 or so when the study was published. He emailed us a list indicating the institutions providing grades from around 1960 include Penn State University; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Minnesota; the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; the University of Wisconsin; and Rice University.

Both researchers said it’s reasonable to compare course grades at 14 schools or so in 1960 to course grades gleaned from 135 institutions in recent years.

Healy said the mix of circa-1960 schools, which included private institutions such as Pomona College and Furman, represents more selective institutions compared with the bigger present-day sample, which includes more less-selective colleges. ""So, if anything, if there had been no grade inflation, one would expect the sample of today's colleges to show slightly lower grades than in our 1960 sample,"" Healy said.

He elaborated by phone: ""A less-selective school would award fewer As, hence there would be less of gap."" For a long time, he said, more-selective schools have tended to award more generous grades. ""They also tend to have the best students,"" he said.

In Texas, Texas A&M University and Texas State University have provided grades to the researches. At A&M in 1985, the researchers say, 26 percent of grades given in undergraduate courses were A’s compared with 39 percent in 2011. At Texas State in 1960, 14 percent of grades were A’s; the tally in 2007 was 34 percent, the researchers say. Healy said that at both institutions, the prevalence of A’s slightly trailed national averages.

For outside perspective, we asked Shouping Hu, a Florida State University professor of higher education, to evaluate the 2011 study.

Hu, who edited a 2005 book on changes in student grades, said by email that there has been an upward trend in college grades, though it may not be accurate to attribute that to ""grade inflation.""

We weren’t sure how to interpret that; Hu did not elaborate.

By phone, Rojstaczer commented by saying that at some schools, the quality of students has increased. ""You can attribute up to 30 percent of the rise in grades at some institutions to students being demonstrably better than they once were,"" he said. Still, he said, it’s not plausible that 43 percent of students, on average, are doing excellent class work, which means there has been grade inflation.

Next, we asked Arthur Levine, president of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation and former president of Teachers College at Columbia University, for thoughts on the 2011 study. Levine said by phone that while grades from 14 colleges represent a small sample, that’s not problematic if researchers also check course grades at the institutions in subsequent years--which Rojstaczer and Healy did. If so, Levine said, ""they’re comparing apples to apples.""

Levine has incorporated surveys of students about their GPAs into his own work. In 1969, he said, 7 percent of surveyed students at two- and four-year colleges said their GPA was A-minus or higher. In 2009, he said, 41 percent of students reported as much.

Broadly, Levine said, grade inflation started when professors took it easier on male students to spare them from being sent to Vietnam.

The 2011 study says that after the Vietnam era, a decline in A’s lasted roughly a decade, but the share of A’s began to rise again in the mid-1980s. Healy told us that he believes factors behind the renewed upward sweep include professors being more mindful of student evaluations and feeling pressure to award high grades so that students can advance to law or medical school.

Our ruling

Lindsay wrote that about 43 percent of all college grades today are A's, an increase of 28 percentage points from 1960.

That’s supported by a 2011 study covering grades from 1960 into the 2000s, making this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB994FC0>],/factchecks/2013/jan/31/thomas-lindsay/thomas-lindsay-says-43-percent-college-grades-are-/
"['Ohio', 'Congress', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Sherrod Brown']","
Sen. Sherrod Brown says the deal to avert the 'fiscal cliff' reduces the deficit
","
Remember how Congress made its fiscal-cliff deal with votes on New Year’s Day?

Democrats wanted to raise income taxes on high-earners but not cut future Medicare or Social Security benefits. Republicans didn’t want to raise income tax rates, but wanted to cut federal spending and tackle looming entitlement shortfalls.

So on New Year’s Day, Congress voted on a compromise, raising taxes on people with incomes above $400,000, or $450,000 for couples. It also delayed more than $100 billion in scheduled spending cuts for two months. 

Logically, you’d think that without cutting spending or raising a whole lot more money through taxes, the nettlesome federal deficit would have only one direction to go: Up. That’s why Sen. Sherrod Brown’s statement on the day of the vote intrigued PolitiFact Ohio. Brown said:

""While this deal isn’t perfect, it represents an important down payment in reducing the deficit and getting America’s fiscal house in order. It also prevents dangerous cuts to Social Security and reduces the deficit by asking millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share.""

How could it cut the deficit? 

To understand, we turned to federal budgeting documents and outside group analyses. What we found could serve as a lesson in Washington’s unique logic, though it has its reasons. It’s like a riddle:

Did the fiscal-cliff deal really reduce the deficit?

That depends.

This answer, maddeningly equivocal though it may be, is the one the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office gives in its analysis of the deal, officially called the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The CBO director’s blog said this on Jan. 4: 

""Does the Legislation Increase or Decrease Federal Budget Deficits? That depends on what you compare the legislation with."" 

Explaining this requires on-the-one-hand and on-the-other, so let’s start with the first hand. 

Under laws sought and signed by President George W. Bush, Americans across a range of incomes saw their income taxes reduced, starting in 2001 and with more cuts in 2003. President Barack Obama extended the cuts in 2009. Those tax cuts had expiration dates written into law, however, namely, Dec, 31, 2012. 

If you believed the expiration date was inflexible, you’d think that everyone’s tax rates were going up on New Year’s Day. 

Yet if you paid attention to the talk in Washington, you knew better. You knew that Congress would probably pass bills so that middle-class families could keep their Bush-era tax rates, as Obama wanted, too. You knew that the alternative-minimum tax, using a formula that was about to sock many more families, would be fixed, either temporarily or permanently. Congress on Jan. 1, 2013, chose the latter.

And you knew that neither Democrats nor Republicans wanted big cuts at the Pentagon, even though they previously passed the law that said such cuts would kick in. Sure, lawmakers in 2011 agreed to these eventual cuts when they couldn’t find a better compromise on that year’s budget crisis du jour. But they always vowed to try to find an alternative.

Thus, the one hand -- and the other. 

Budgeters deal in numbers and must have a baseline from which to start. The law is a good place, providing a firm benchmark.

So to return to Brown’s claim: If the law had remained in effect and most Americans experienced income tax hikes, the government would be due to collect a lot more tax revenue. And if the scheduled spending cuts, or sequestration, had begun as scheduled, slicing federal outlays by about $110 billion in 2013, the government would be saving a lot more money.

But neither of these things happened because Congress on New Year’s Day changed the law with its American Taxpayer Relief Act. And what happens when you cut the amount of projected government revenue (by keeping many of the lower tax rates) and you spend more, not less? Based on current-law projections, your deficit is bound to rise. 

The CBO on Jan. 1 projected, in fact, a rise in the deficit by nearly $4 trillion over the next 10 years, a figure that many in the news media highlighted. The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, whose members include former Ohio U.S. Sen. George Voinovich, put the deficit rise at $4.6 trillion when adding some of the non-tax items such as the cost of extending unemployment benefits. 

So Brown was wrong, right?

Not necessarily. 

Here is where reality kicks in, and the CBO recognizes reality. Besides projecting what would happen based on then-current law, the CBO also ran projections based on ""current policy.""  Then-current policy was always to extend many of the tax cuts beyond their scheduled expiration. The only question was which tax cuts would be preserved. 

Democrats pushed for months to raise rates for families earning more than $250,000 a year, for example. For purposes of projections, the CBO assumed under an ""alternative fiscal scenario"" last August that all the Bush-era tax cuts would be extended. 

The fiscal-cliff deal turned out to be less generous than that, at least for families earning more than $450,000. Furthermore, the estate tax rate will rise from 35 to 40 percent (but will keep the $5.25 million exemption) under the New Year’s deal. Taxes on capital gains and dividends for families earning more than $450,000 will rise from 15 percent to 20 percent. 

There are additional changes, but you get the idea. All told, this group of tax hikes should bring in enough money -- if you compare it with what was expected to happen politically -- to actually cut deficit projections by $650 billion, says the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The CBO, in the director’s blog, said the deficit will be $700 billion to $800 billion less than projected under a continuation of anticipated policies. 

This is not the end of the budget debate, because the sequestration is now scheduled to start on March 1, although it is still deeply unpopular and Congress could change its date or size. 

How then, how does Brown’s claim rate for accuracy? 

Based on the CBO’s analysis, he was wrong -- if you use the baseline built on the old law and an assumption that every single tax cut would end and the sequester would kick in as scheduled. 

But Brown was right if you use the CBO’s alternative analysis. If you were gambling, you’d probably bet somewhere in the middle, which in a way is what Congress did.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Brown’s claim rates Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7D3F40>],/factchecks/2013/jan/31/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-deal-avert-fiscal-cliff-red/
"['Crime', 'Texas', 'Guns', 'Greg Abbott']","
Greg Abbott says that according to FBI, more people are killed each year with clubs, hammers than with rifles
","
Not long before President Barack Obama’s Jan. 16, 2013, speech calling for more gun control measures, Texas’ attorney general tweeted about a different class of assault weapons.

Greg Abbott wrote, ""FBI: More people killed with hammers & clubs each year than rifles,"" and supplied a link to a Jan. 3, 2013, Fox News commentary piece that originated on Breitbart.com and referred to FBI murder statistics from 2005 through 2011.

PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., recently tackled a similar claim culled from Facebook: 



Obama was on the record supporting bans on certain semi-automatic rifles before his Jan. 16 speech, in which he again called for renewing the 1994-2004 federal ""assault weapons"" ban while urging education, mental health and other measures to reduce gun violence.

Like Abbott’s tweet, the Facebook post cited the FBI. PolitiFact looked at the bureau’s annual report on ""Crime in the United States,"" a collection of data from local agencies on several categories of crimes.

The Facebook post earned a ""True"" rating because it reflected the FBI’s statistics from 2011, the most recent year available, for murders with knives (1,694), personal weapons (728, typed on Facebook as 726), blunt objects (496) and rifles (323).

The Facebook post did not include homicides the FBI attributed to handguns (6,220), firearms whose type was not stated (1,587) and ""other guns"" (97). Those numbers mean handguns were used in 72 percent of all firearm murders in 2011 and slightly under half of all murders using any kind of weapon that year.

Abbott’s tweet, similarly, did not include some FBI-tracked categories by referring solely to rifles and blunt objects and leaving out other significant firearm categories. Still, according to the FBI’s data covering 2005 through 2011, blunt objects such as clubs and hammers were consistently used to murder more people than rifles alone.

FBI homicide data 2005-2011, ranked in order of weapons used most often in 2011: 


 Our ruling

Like an older Facebook item, Abbott’s tweet uses data selectively, ignoring the significant role of handguns in gun violence. That said, it is correct that FBI data indicates that in 2011, more people were killed with ""clubs and hammers"" than with any type of rifle.

We rate his statement as True.

"['National', 'Criminal Justice', 'Guns', 'Kirsten Gillibrand']","
Kirsten Gillibrand says 40 percent of guns sold today escape background check
","
Gun control advocates are lining up behind President Barack Obama’s call for a law requiring universal background checks on gun purchases.

""The background checks bill is vitally important,"" New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said in an interview on MSNBC Jan. 24, 2013. It’s ""going to basically say you can’t buy guns without getting a background check. Today, about 40 percent of guns are purchased without a background check.""

If the figure sounds familiar, it’s because gun control advocates are citing it with abandon. Obama mentioned it in the White House ceremony outlining his slate of new gun restrictions. A white paper by researchers at Johns Hopkins University asserts it without qualification. Indeed, it’s a powerful claim: that 40 percent of guns are bought and sold in America with no paper trail, no fingerprint of the hands they fall into. Gillibrand is right that federal law does not require background checks on all gun purchases, contrary to what polls show most Americans support.

It’s the 40-percent figure that’s the sticking point.

We have examined this claim before at PolitiFact, when New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in July 2012, ""There's a loophole where you can sell guns without a background check … 40 percent of guns are sold that way"" at gun shows and over the Internet. At the time we rated the claim Mostly True.   But since the Newtown, Conn., school shooting, we’ve heard the statistic repeated again and again, plus seen criticism of its use. So we’ve decided to take another look. We have since re-rated the Bloomberg fact-check to Half True.

The 1997 study

The original source of the 40 percent figure is a 1997 National Institute of Justice study by researchers Philip Cook of Duke University and Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, who examined data from a 1994 telephone survey about gun ownership. The survey, which sampled 2,568 homes, asked owners an array of questions, including how many guns were in the house, what they were used for, how they were stored and how they were obtained.

But it’s important to note that of the 2,568 households surveyed, only 251 people answered the question about the origin of their gun.

But in those answers, Cook and Ludwig found that 35.7 percent of respondents reported obtaining their gun from somewhere other than a licensed dealer. (That has been rounded up to 40 percent.) Some people answered ""probably"" and ""probably not"" if they weren’t entirely sure whether the seller was a licensed dealer. In some cases, where the respondent skipped the question about whether the gun came from a licensed dealer, the researchers made a judgment call. Ludwig said in an email that they mined answers to other questions (such as whether the gun was a gift) to guide them.

""Our approach ... was to be conservative in estimating what fraction of sales are in the primary market,"" Ludwig wrote. ""Primary market"" refers to guns sold by dealers in retail stores or pawn shops. The ""secondary market"" includes gun shows and other transactions where a background check is not required.

Some critics find fault with the 40 percent figure because it includes guns that are inherited or won -- in other words, transactions that could reasonably be assumed not to involve a background check.

The NRA, arguably the loudest voice of opposition to tighter gun controls, referenced the study in a recent blog post. The group does not dispute the method or findings of the study but says the 40 percent claim is a misinterpretation by gun control advocates.

We’re confident that the study, conducted by respected researchers using the best available evidence, was reliable in its time. What’s less clear: how reliable it remains today.

‘I have no idea’

We asked Cook, the other study author, what he thought about the 40 percent figure being referenced so frequently since gun control lurched back to the forefront of the national debate.

""I’ve been amazed at how much interest there’s been in it. It’s been lying there dormant for 20 years,"" he said.

So is it still a current, reliable estimate of secondary market gun sales?

""The answer is I have no idea,"" Cook said. ""This survey was done almost 20 years ago. … It’s clear there are a lot of transactions that are not through dealers. How many, we’re not really clear on it. … We would say it’s a very old number.""

Other scholars had similar views.

""I don’t see how anyone could know that number,"" said James Jacobs, Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University School of Law.

Paul Blackman is a retired criminologist and former research coordinator for the NRA Institute for Legislative Action. ""Personally, I think your safest bet is to say that no one knows, but that the vast majority of crime guns come from some other source than gun shows,"" he told us.

One expert, David Kopel at the University of Denver law school, said he doesn’t think the figure was ever accurate because of what the survey actually asked.

""The study did not say whether there was a background check on the sale. It asked the buyer, do you think there was? So some buyers may have known, some may not have known,"" Kopel said. ""All it measured was buyer perception, not whether a check actually occurred.""

A stable market

We looked but couldn’t find any more recent studies like Cook’s and Ludwig’s. Some gun control advocates blame a federal freeze on funding gun research for the lack of new data. But even absent that, some experts argue that little has changed about the gun market in the decades since the study was conducted.

""It’s a fairly stable market. That is to say, gun stores have had their part, police supply stores have had their part, and then there are the gun shows and private dealings about which we know very little,"" said Robert McCrie, of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""To be sure, there has been this bump up in gun purchases, which we know from reports from gun stores and the companies like Smith & Wesson. There’s the knowledge that the market has been more vigorous and probably that higher vigor has been reflected in gun shows and private sales in tandem.""

His take: ""The 40 percent seems about right.""

Jay Corzine has attended and studies gun shows in Florida. The University of Central Florida professor says that based on his observation, no more than 15 to 20 percent of sales at gun shows happen without a background check. But when you add in other private sales -- neighbors selling to neighbors, ads in the paper, etc. -- the 40 percent figure is ""probably accurate"" and ""a very good figure to use.""

Gary Kleck, whose research has provided the foundation for less restrictive concealed carry laws, agrees that conditions in the gun market haven’t changed much.

""I know of no affirmative reason to think that the methods of acquiring guns has significantly changed in recent decades, or that conditions have changed such that private (non-dealer) transfers have become more (or less) important. The laws regulating gun sales have not gotten significantly more (or less) strict since the 1994 Brady Act, so there's no strong basis for expecting fewer dealer sales or more non-dealer sales as a result of legal changes,"" Kleck, a professor at Florida State University, wrote in an email.

Kleck says the 40 percent estimate is ""probably still reasonably valid today."" But he further argues that this fact shouldn’t guide new policy, because the problem is not how legal, background-checked purchasers are obtaining guns, but how criminals are.

Our ruling

Gillibrand claimed that ""today, about 40 percent of guns are purchased without a background check.""

She, and other gun control advocates who have cited that figure, correctly repeated the findings of a well-respected study about gun ownership. There’s no question that many guns are bought and sold in America without the oversight of a background check.

But is 40 percent true ""today,"" as Gillibrand said? Even the author of the original study says nobody knows. By mentioning the statistic as if it is current and accurate, Gillibrand revealed nothing of the fact that the figure is almost 20 years old. That’s an essential detail that people engaged in the gun debate should know.

All this leads us to rate her statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE374C0>],/factchecks/2013/jan/30/kirsten-gillibrand/gillibrand-says-40-percent-guns-sold-today-escape-/

Chuck Hagel has called for 'an end to our nuclear program,' says Americans for a Strong Defense
","
The United States faces terrifying threats from foreign countries, but Chuck Hagel, the nominee for defense secretary, wants to close up our nuclear shop, says Americans for a Strong Defense, a group formed to oppose Hagel’s nomination.

""We live in a dangerous world,"" says the narrator in an ad that ran shortly before the Jan. 31 hearings were set to begin. ""Iran. North Korea. Even Russia."" Ominous news coverage mentions ""brand new threats from Iran aimed squarely at the United States,"" North Korea launching a ""long-range missile"" and Russia ""test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile.""

The narrator continues: ""But Barack Obama’s nominee for Secretary of Defense wants America to back down. An end to our nuclear program. Devastating defense cuts. A weaker country.""

We wanted to explore whether Hagel, a former two-term Republican senator from Nebraska, supports ""an end to our nuclear program.""

Americans for a Strong Defense launched the ad to run in five states: Arkansas, Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana and North Carolina, where Democratic senators are up for re-election in 2014. The group has Republican ties; board members include Romney advisors Brian Hook and Danny Diaz. Maurico Claver-Carone, author of the Capitol Hill Cubans blog, is also a board member.

The group is one of a handful of conservative groups attacking Hagel. We have previously fact-checked other claims about Hagel’s positions on Iran and sanctions, including one by the Emergency Committee for Israel and by U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Miami.

 Global Zero

Many of the attacks on Hagel’s positions about nuclear weapons relate to a May 2012 report he co-wrote for Global Zero, which describes itself as an ""international movement for the elimination of all nuclear weapons."" It has drawn support from hundreds of world leaders, including President Barack Obama. (Hagel doesn’t have a paid job with Global Zero.)

This is not a peacenik report from the tie-dye set advocating getting rid of the defense department or all weapons. The co-authors included high-level security and international experts: General James Cartwright, a former commander of the U.S. nuclear forces under President George W. Bush; Richard Burt, a former U.S. chief nuclear arms negotiator; Thomas R. Pickering, a former ambassador to Russia; and Gen. John J. Sheehan, who held senior NATO positions.

The report called for nuclear weapon reductions in the United States and Russia and negotiating with other countries to reduce their arsenals. It outlines a goal of having no more than 900 nuclear weapons within 10 years in the United States. That would be an 80 percent reduction, said Bruce Blair, co-founder of Global Zero and study director, in an interview with PolitiFact.

The authors argued that the United States’ large nuclear stockpiles aren’t a reliable way to deter or defeat terrorists. An example: 9/11. Our stockpile ""proved utterly powerless"" to deter or respond to the attack.

""In fact, strong conventional forces and missile defenses may offer a far superior
option for deterring and defeating a regional aggressor,"" they wrote.

The report does mention the long-term goal of ""total elimination"" of nuclear weapons -- a 2010 Global Zero plan identified that goal for the year 2030.

The 2012 report mentions the option of pursuing elimination of nuclear weapons unilaterally but calls that ""the less good approach.""

The report focuses more on working together with Russia and pursuing a multilateral approach: ""Nuclear arms regulation must become comprehensive and universal.""

The report also criticizes the current ""launch-ready"" postures, which give the president potentially mere minutes to decide about launching an attack, and calls for waiting 24 to 72 hours to strike.

Blair told PolitiFact in an interview that the goal is to ""ensure that no other country has nuclear weapons to threaten us or any of our allies. ... The goal is really to set the bar at zero for everyone.""

Global Zero sent us a statement by Hagel’s co-authors emphasizing that they called for bilateral reductions with Russia and multilateral negotiations.

""The suggestion that we naively believe that the elimination of nuclear weapons can be achieved easily or in short order is likewise false. We, again, have clearly stated in our many reports and statements that this cannot be achieved quickly nor easily. It will take decades of painstaking work, including the establishment of a verification regime with universal, intrusive inspections,"" the statement said.

Americans for a Strong Defense also cited additional, similar comments of Hagel’s, urging the United States to move toward world elimination of nuclear weapons.

Other experts

The experts we interviewed about reducing nuclear weapons said that Hagel’s views represent the bipartisan mainstream among nuclear and security experts, and that the United States can safely reduce its nuclear arsenal.

The Global Zero report’s recommendations would lower nuclear risks to the United States, said nuclear proliferation expert and Harvard professor Matthew Bunn in an email to PolitiFact. ""Why that isn't something to be celebrated in a Secretary of Defense is beyond me. It mentions the possibility of elimination of nuclear weapons only briefly, as a long-term objective; every President since Eisenhower (except George W. Bush) has embraced the goal of prohibition of nuclear weapons in a similar way — ironically, Ronald Reagan was perhaps even more of an enthusiast for nuclear disarmament than Barack Obama.""

Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that the ad creates a misleading impression about the threat the U.S. faces.

""What the ad is not explaining is that North Koreans have no more than 10 nuclear bombs and don’t have the capability of delivering those bombs across the Pacific U.S.,"" he said. ""The Iranians at this point thankfully don’t have any nuclear weapons. It implies those counties have something they could hit us with -- something nuclear -- and they don’t.""

Our ruling

The ad paints a picture of a ""dangerous world"" in which countries including Iran and North Korea are ready to attack the United States, while Hagel wants to back down and put ""an end to our nuclear program."" The ad leaves viewers with the false impression that Hagel wants to quickly shutter our nuclear program -- regardless of the nuclear ambitions of other countries, including our foes.

Hagel has called for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons, but with some major caveats the ad ignores. He is a supporter of Global Zero, which has called for worldwide elimination by 2030. The report he co-authored calls for reducing the U.S. stockpile to 900 nuclear warheads by 2022, but it says that the best way to achieve that reduction is together with Russia and other countries.

"['Georgia', 'State Budget', 'Steve Henson']","
Democrat leader says GOP policies not doing enough to boost Georgia economy
","
The top Democrat in the Georgia Senate recently made his case that his party has the better plan to revitalize the state’s economy.

The proposal by Senate Minority Leader Steve Henson included an interesting claim about Georgia’s finances that we wanted to fact-check.

""State revenue projections have missed the mark month after month,"" Henson, a veteran lawmaker from DeKalb County, said in a news release.

Liz Flowers, who wrote the news release, explained to us what Henson meant. State budget officials projected revenue collected by Georgia’s government would increase by almost 5 percent during the 12-month fiscal year that will end June 30, said Flowers, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Senate Democratic Caucus. 

Henson’s point is there have been several months in which the state fell below the 5 percent mark. While Georgia lawmakers did not make monthly revenue estimates, Henson believes it is fair to examine revenue on a monthly basis by the 5 percent benchmark, noting that the state’s finances are tracked on a monthly basis.

""It wouldn’t make sense to check our state budget only annually,"" Henson said.

Georgia lawmakers passed a budget this year that they expected to collect about $19.2 billion in total revenue for this fiscal year. The overwhelming bulk of state revenue comes from property, sales and income taxes. About $1 billion of that money comes from lottery sales and other sources, which are directed to specific state programs. The $18.2 billion in projected general revenue is a 4.9 percent increase from the prior fiscal year, which began July 1, 2011, and ended June 30, 2012.

Georgia’s estimated increase for the current fiscal year was higher than most states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Economists say Georgia’s economy is growing, which they attribute to an increase in information technology, business services, manufacturing and transportation jobs.

Each month, Gov. Nathan Deal’s office releases a breakdown of total taxes and revenue the state collected the prior month. Here’s the breakdown:

July 2012: up 7.4 percent.
August 2012: up 1.9 percent.
September 2012: up 3.9 percent.
October 2012: up 6.4 percent.
November 2012: down 0.7 percent.
December 2012: up 9.8 percent.

Georgia’s revenue increased less than 5 percent in three of those six months, according to those estimates. The monthly breakdowns do not explain why state revenue was lower during some months. Through those six months, state officials estimate they have collected about $8.5 billion in total taxes and other revenue, a 4.9 percent increase over the same period in the prior fiscal year. 

The state’s fiscal economist, Ken Heaghney, told a joint committee of Georgia lawmakers on Jan. 22 that tax collections are projected to increase by 3.9 percent for the rest of this fiscal year. 

Henson said the state’s latest estimate of a 3.9 percent increase for the remainder of the fiscal year also validates his argument.

""In 2012, Georgia's revenue projections remained low for nearly half the year. A spike to 9 percent in December made up ground in the governor's revenue projections,"" Henson said.

To sum up, the senator claimed ""state revenue projections have missed the mark month after month."" Revenue increased less than 5 percent in three of the six months so far this fiscal year. The state, though, doesn’t do monthly revenue projections, and Georgia is on pace to increase its revenue by almost 5 percent from the prior fiscal year. 

Technically, there’s accuracy in Henson’s statement, but there’s also some important context missing. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7CDA80>],/factchecks/2013/jan/30/steve-henson/democrat-leader-says-gop-policies-not-doing-enough/

Rep. Marcia Fudge says 30 million people were in poverty when George W. Bush left office
","
As a member of Congress who represents an urban area with many low-income residents, Warrensville Heights Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge has made fighting poverty one of her legislative priorities in Congress, as well as a priority of the Congressional Black Caucus she recently began to chair.

On Jan. 17. Fudge joined a George Washington University panel discussion on poverty that was hosted by PBS’ Tavis Smiley. Other panelists included outspoken Union Theological Seminary professor Cornel West and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a recent Republican candidate for president. 

During the discussion, Fudge decried efforts to balance the federal budget by cutting aid to the poor. She argued that many of the nation’s fiscal problems were caused by two wars in the Middle East, the creation of the Medicare Part D program, and tax cuts implemented by President George W. Bush. In an effort to point out that increased needs for social service programs did not begin under President Barack Obama, Fudge said that  ""When George Bush became president of the United States, 17 million people were in poverty. When he left, 30 million people were in poverty."" When Smiley pointed out that poverty continued to worsen during Obama’s presidency, Fudge agreed. She said neither party has done enough to fight poverty, but health care reform legislation Obama passed ""significantly"" helped poor people, as did money in the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for programs like Head Start, Pell Grants, food stamps, and unemployment insurance. She argued problems would be worse if Obama hadn’t taken those steps.

PolitiFact has periodically examined claims about poverty in the United States. The poverty numbers that Fudge cited for the Bush presidency actually sounded low to us, so we asked her office where she got them.

Fudge spokeswoman Belinda Prinz replied that Fudge - the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Subcommittee that oversees the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (also known as food stamps) used statistics on the number of people using SNAP benefits during Bush’s presidency instead of numbers that described those living in poverty.  She said poverty and SNAP numbers both rose during Bush’s presidency, though they didn’t increase at identical rates. SNAP benefits, with some exceptions, are available to people with incomes up to 130% of the poverty line and thus can be used to aid the near poor, including the working poor, as well as anyone classified below the poverty line, said Prinz. 

""It was unintentional to describe SNAP data as poverty data,"" Prinz’s email said.

Prinz forwarded material from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that indicated 17.3 million people used food stamps when Bush took office in 2001 and that 28.2 million used them during 2008, his last year in office. By 2012, USDA figures show the number of people using the SNAP program rose to 46.6 million people. Prinz also sent a report from the Food Research and Action Center that said food stamp participation topped 31.7 million people during Bush’s last month in office, December 2008. A Congressional Budget Office report on the food stamp program attributes the dramatic rise in the program’s use to ""the deep recession from December 2007 to June 2009 and the subsequent slow recovery.""

As Fudge’s office said, poverty rates and food stamp usage both rose during the terms of Presidents Bush and Obama. Census data shows that in 2001, the year President Bush took office, 32.9 million people - or 11.7 percent of the U.S. population - lived below the poverty level. During Bush’s last year in office, 2008, 39.8 million people or 13.2 percent of the population lived below the poverty line. By 2011 - well into Obama’s term - there were 46.2 million impoverished people, a 15 percent rate of poverty.  

The point that Fudge was trying to make - that poverty rose under the presidency of George Bush - is correct. But singling out Bush is misleading because poverty also has gone up under Obama. And her numbers were incorrect. Her substitution of SNAP numbers for poverty data led her to significantly understate the number of people living in poverty. We rule her statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC4E200>],/factchecks/2013/jan/30/marcia-fudge/rep-marcia-fudge-says-30-million-people-were-pover/

Is Oak Grove one of the largest cities in Oregon, in Clackamas County?
","
In an exit interview with The Oregonian, outgoing Clackamas County board chairwoman Charlotte Lehan was asked what she would have done differently while in office.

""I've been asked that question before, so I've thought about it quite a bit. The only thing I can think of is the work we did on Oak Grove on the tree ordinance,"" she said. Some people from that part of unincorporated Clackamas County wanted a tree ordinance, but Lehan says the county should not have helped. Why? Because that’s work cities do, and if anything, the county should have helped launch ""Oak Grove into its own city-hood"" so it could pass its own tree ordinance.

""They are way too big, they are one of the largest cities in Oregon. They should be a powerhouse in Oregon. They should have a faction at the county level, the state level and the city level,"" she said. Later, in the interview, she said, ""It's the biggest city in Clackamas County and it's not a city.""

That we had a potential city this large in Clackamas County was news to us. We wanted to know: If incorporated, would Oak Grove be the largest city in Clackamas County? Would it be one of the largest cities in Oregon?

Oak Grove has a cinema and a market center. Its population in 2010 was 16,629, according to the U.S. Census. That didn’t sound very large to us, so we consulted our colleagues who cover the county. And it turns out that county insiders all know that Oak Grove is more than just Oak Grove when talking about the controversial topic of incorporation.

A group called Friends of Local Control has wanted to incorporate the areas of Oak Grove, Jennings Lodge and Oatfield, although they’ve never gotten so far as to draw boundaries. However, the area in question is roughly the area served by the Oak Lodge Water District and last we heard, residents surveyed wanted little to do with incorporation and any new city fees that would bring.

Let’s flesh out the estimated population of this city-in-waiting. According to the Census, Jennings Lodge had a population of 7,315 in 2010 and Oatfield had a population of 13,415. Add them all up, and a proposed city would have 37,359 residents. (This is the most recent year available for unincorporated census areas.)

The largest city in Clackamas County is Lake Oswego, with 36,619 people in 2010 and an estimated 37,046in 2011, according to the U.S. Census. Oregon City, the county seat, had an estimated 32,500 people in 2012, compared with 36,770 for Lake Oswego. (The 2012 estimates are by Portland State University.)

So the bottom line is that a new city of Oak Grove, Jennings Lodge and Oatfield would rival Lake Oswego as the most populous city in Clackamas County. Lehan is on the right track with that claim, if you keep in mind that Oak Grove is a sort of shorthand for a larger area.

Now, what about the claim that the area in question is ""one of the largest cities in Oregon?"" Let’s look at the large-ish cities we do have, according to Portland State’s 2012 calculations and 2011 Census estimates.  
  

Lake Oswego ranks No. 13 in both columns.

Lehan said in an email to PolitiFact Oregon that she was referring to the ""unincorporated, generally contiguous area that includes Clackamas, Jennings Lodge, Oak Grove, Oak Lodge, Oatfield and other neighboring neighborhoods."" She estimates the total population at ""nearly 40,000, putting it slightly ahead of Lake Oswego."" (Oak Lodge Water commissioner Jim Knapp, who disapproves of incorporation, does not contest her number.)

She also said that there are 242 incorporated cities in Oregon. A mythical new city of Oak Grove would be 13th or 14th.  ""If it were anywhere in the top 15, or even the top 20, out of 242 cities I would not consider it to be inaccurate to say it is among Oregon's largest cities,"" she wrote.  

We can see her point of view. On the other hand, Oregon is a state of small towns and cities, so it’s not that hard to crack the top 20. According to Portland State, 214 of 242 cities are under 20,000 people.

Lehan said in her exit interview that Oak Grove ""should be up there with Gresham and Beaverton and Hillsboro and they aren't."" Maybe Oak Grove should be a bigger power player in the tri-county region, but population-wise, it’s simply not on par with the Washington County cities of Hillsboro or Beaverton, or Gresham in east Multnomah County. And really, Oak Grove pales next to the 49,425 residents in the unincorporated ""census designated place"" of Aloha in Washington County.

Where does that leave us ruling-wise? Well, we understand that Lehan was speaking with a county readership in mind, using geographic shorthand to describe an issue familiar to some people in Clackamas County. But it’s our job to rate statements for a general readership.

First, estimates show that a new Oak Grove city would rival Lake Oswego for the honor of largest city in Clackamas County, but we don’t have an apples to apples count. The most recent numbers for the pretend city is from 2010, and a population count would depend on the precision of new boundaries.

Second, if incorporated, the city would land in the top 15 most populous cities in Oregon -- but the statement is missing information on just how small it would be compared with other large cities. The cities she names -- Beaverton, Gresham and Hillsboro -- are twice the size.

Third, Oak Grove itself has fewer than 20,000 people. Words matter to PolitiFact Oregon and here, she didn’t spell out the larger geographical area.

We rate Lehan’s statement Half True. It is partially accurate but leaves out a cumulation of important details.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7F9FC0>],/factchecks/2013/jan/30/charlotte-lehan/oak-grove-one-largest-cities-oregon-clackamas-coun/

Rhode Island Rep. Peter Palumbo says a dog in a driver’s lap poses flying projectile risk
","
Note to pet owners: that license you got for Fido is not a license for the dog to drive.

That seems to be what some drivers are thinking when they let their pet sit behind the steering wheel.

State Rep. Peter Palumbo, concerned that lapdogs and their owners might end up playing dead for real, issued a news release on Jan. 22 announcing that he had introduced 2013-H 5101, legislation that would prohibit drivers from allowing dogs to sit on their laps. Fines would range from $85 for a first offense to as high as $125.

""A driver preoccupied by a pet on his lap is not a safe driver,"" he said.

Palumbo, a Cranston Democrat, reported that a 2010 survey done by AAA found that 21 percent of drivers let a dog ride in their lap during the previous year. But it was the next sentence of his news release that appealed to our fact-checking instincts.

""The auto club called it dangerous because an unrestrained 10-pound dog traveling at 50 miles per hour flies forward with 500 pounds of pressure in a crash and an 80-pound dog at only 30 mph packs a 2,400-pound punch,"" his news release said.

Three questions immediately came to mind: (1.) Who puts an 80-pound dog on his lap? (2.) Could an 80-pound dog even FIT between a driver and the steering wheel? and (3.) If you get into an accident with Marmaduke on your lap, wouldn't the big dog actually cushion you from the impact?

While we waited for Palumbo to get back to us, we found a July 19, 2011, news release from AAA that contained key elements of his argument. It reports on the results of a 2011 survey of 1,000 owners who have driven with their dogs in the previous year.

The survey found that 17 percent admitted to holding their dog while driving or allowing it to sit on their lap. (It turns out that the 21 percent figure Palumbo cited is from a similar 2010 survey.)

Both news releases say more common distractions for drivers are taking a hand off the wheel to pet their dogs or restrain them when putting on the brakes.

And both news releases urge drivers to use restraint systems for their dogs. (The surveys were sponsored by Kurgo, a company that just happens to sell products for safely restraining animals when they travel).

So what does this have to do with dogs in your lap?

Not much.

The numbers in the news releases that Palumbo cites are mostly relevant to dogs elsewhere in the car, not on the driver's lap. The dog might even help cushion the impact for the driver, a scenario that wouldn't be good for the dog.  

""It is very likely the crash will be fatal to your pet,"" Heather Hunter of AAA told us. ""In this situation your pet will be hit with tremendous force from both the driver and air bag. The driver is also at greater risk for internal injury or death."" The airbag ""will throw your pet into you as you are being thrown into the airbag.""

The biggest problem with lapdogs is that they are a distraction that can cause an accident, she stressed.

Hunter was also able to answer another question for us. It turns out she has an 80-pound dog, which she said wouldn’t fit on her lap ""unless I had the seat all the way back, and in that case I'm not reaching the pedals.""

When Palumbo got back to us, he acknowledged that a lap dog might actually cushion the impact. ""I didn't think of that,"" he said.

He said he has not proposed any law requiring pets to be restrained in vehicles.

Our ruling

In arguing for a proposed law that would ban dogs from the laps of drivers, Rep. Peter Palumbo says that AAA says the practice is ""dangerous because an unrestrained 10-pound dog traveling at 50 miles per hour flies forward with 500 pounds of pressure in a crash and an 80-pound dog at only 30 mph packs a 2,400-pound punch.""

Driving with a dog in your lap is dangerous, but not for the reason he cites.

Because his statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate Half True.

 (After publication of this item, several readers informed us that the characterization of the force of a flying dog -- as made by AAA and repeated by Palumbo -- was incorrect.

(""One cannot simply multiply speed by weight to get an impact force,"" said Daniel Schmidt of Blacksburg, Va., a mathematics graduate student at Virginia Tech. ""Think about this: running into something at high speed would hurt just as much in deep space, where all weights are zero.""

(""For that matter, there is no way to calculate the impact force from the given data,"" he said, citing one problem in Palumbo's -- and AAA's -- statement. ""One would also need to know how long it takes for the dog (and the car) to stop moving. Stopping relatively slowly would mean that the force would be small, and stopping very suddenly would produce a huge force, even with the same mass and initial velocity."")

Dianne Feinstein says one of five law enforcement officers killed are killed by assault weapons
","Almost six weeks after the gun rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., took the lead in proposing a new assault weapons ban. She later argued for its passage on the Jan. 28, 2013, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation.

Host Bob Schieffer asked Feinstein, ""What about the idea -- which some gun rights supporters cite -- they say, ‘Look, all of this is just to make people feel good. It's just, kind of, feel-good legislation’ -- that, in the end, it's not going to stop these kinds of incidents?""

Feinstein responded in part, ""Well, that's absolutely not true. What we are trying to do is overall see that weapons ... are in the hands of responsible citizens, that they are used legally, not illegally, that they do not fall into the hands of gangs. Do you realize we have 150,000-plus gang members in this nation? When they go up against the police, it's generally an AK-47. You realize that police have had to break into gun stores to get weapons that would be stronger than the adversary they had? Do you realize that one out of every five law enforcement officers that's killed is killed with an assault weapon?""

A reader asked us whether it was true that ""one out of every five law enforcement officers that's killed is killed with an assault weapon."" So we looked into it. Because Feinstein was talking about gun policy, we will only look at the police officers killed by guns, which in any case accounted for 92 percent of law-enforcement deaths as a result of criminal action between 2002 and 2011, according to FBI data.

When we checked with Feinstein’s office, a spokesman pointed us to a data from the Violence Policy Center, a ""national educational organization working to stop gun death and injury"" and a group that generally favors tighter gun regulations.

This data, obtained from FBI records, showed that eight of the 45 gun-related killings of law-enforcement officers in 2009 were committed with assault weapons. That works out to be almost 18 percent -- quite close to the one in five Feinstein cited.

And this wasn’t a fluke. Calculations published in 2003 by the center showed that during the years 1998 through 2001, at least 41 of the 211 law enforcement officers killed by guns were killed by assault weapons -- 19.4 percent.

We should make an important point, however: There is significant disagreement over what is, or should be, considered ""an assault weapon."" Not all rifles are assault weapons, and not all assault weapons are rifles. For instance, in California -- Feinstein’s home state -- the law includes some types of handguns and shotguns in its definition of ""assault weapon."" But different state laws have different definitions.

For the data it analyzed, the Violence Policy Center went beyond the basic statistics collected by the FBI, which is published in an annual report called ""Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted."" The FBI breaks the felonious killings of officers into those committed by handguns, rifles and shotguns (as well as by weapons other than guns). The FBI does not include a specific category for ""assault weapons.""

For the two periods studied, the Violence Policy Center obtained additional information from the FBI about every incident in which an officer was killed, including the gun’s make and model. The Violence Policy Center has filed Freedom of Information Act requests for more recent data, but has not yet received the information yet, the Feinstein spokesman said.

We showed the data to Mark E. Safarik, executive director of Forensic Behavioral Services Inc. and a former member of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit, to get an independent perspective on whether the Violence Policy Center’s classifications of weapons was reasonable. Safarik told PolitiFact that it’s reasonable to call at least seven of the weapons in the 2009 data ""assault weapons."" In the case of the eighth weapon -- a semiautomatic, .223 caliber rifle of unknown make and model -- he said it’s unclear whether it would qualify as an assault weapon.

Dropping the number of assault weapons from eight to seven would make the percentage about 16 percent -- still not too far off from one in five.

Still, Safarik and others urged caution, emphasizing that ""assault weapon"" can be molded to the purposes of whoever is using the term.

""Whatever any politician wants to define as an assault weapon, that is the way it goes,"" said Vance McLaughlin, a criminal justice professor at Jacksonville State University in Alabama. ""If I define an assault weapon as any semi-auto that has 11 or more cartridges in its magazine, I can then poach some numbers from the handgun category. And on and on and on.""

Our ruling

Because the definition of ""assault weapon"" is subject to debate, the categorization of any given weapon is open to some interpretation. Still, while the numbers were analyzed by a group with a stake in the fight, we find the data reasonable. The data has been consistent in the five years studied, and at worst, Feinstein's figure for the most recent year, 2009, is only a few percentage points high. On balance, we rate her claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB2FF40>],/factchecks/2013/jan/29/dianne-feinstein/dianne-feinstein-says-one-five-law-enforcement-off/
"['State Budget', 'Florida', 'Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda']","
Florida workers have gone six years without raises, says Tallahassee rep
","
Unlike recent years, Florida leaders aren’t talking about budget cuts and layoffs and pay cuts. This year, they’re talking raises.

Gov. Rick Scott, facing a tough reelection bid in 2014, wants the state’s projected budget surplus to go toward $2,500 raises for every public school teacher.

The Legislature’s Republican leaders reacted with reserve. Senate President Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, said teachers are deserving of a raise but so are other state workers, such as correctional officers. House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, said teacher performance should be part of raises, in line with the merit pay plan Scott signed into law in 2011.

Then there’s Rep. Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda, D-Tallahassee, who filed a bill that would award 7 percent raises to all state employees, many of whom live in Tallahassee. She calls it the ""State Employee Fairness Act"" and says it would cost the state $487 million.

""I think the guy or the woman who sweeps the floor and the folks who test the water for (The Department of Environmental Protection) deserve raises across the board,"" Rehwinkel Vasilinda told the Tallahassee Democrat. ""Those people haven't seen raises in six years.""

A reader recently emailed PolitiFact Florida wondering if state employees have really gone that long without a raise. We looked at the issue two years ago, when then-newly inaugurated Scott toured state agencies and gave employees a chance to ask him questions. A Department of Corrections employee told Scott, who had campaigned on shrinking the state workforce and requiring workers to contribute to their pensions, that public employees have already made sacrifices to help the state’s bottom line.

We rated the worker's claim that ""state employees haven't received a raise in five or six years"" Mostly True. At the time, it had been almost four years and five months since the last general pay adjustment for state workers in 2006. And in 2006, state employees got a lump-sum $1,000 bonus in 2007.

With that precedent in mind, we checked in again with the Department of Management Services. The last across-the-board raise the Legislature approved for all state employees was a 3-percent raise on Oct. 1, 2006, a little more than six years ago.

""Across the board"" is an important distinction. A few state agencies have given pay raises within their departments since 2006, said DMS spokesman Ben Wolf. The Florida Highway Patrol implemented a 5 percent pay increase in 2008, and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission issued a 3 percent raise for its law enforcement officers on Jan. 1, 2011, he said.

""Other individual employees have received pay increases since 2006 for exemplary performance,"" Wolf said.

Rehwinkel Vasilinda, who represents thousands of state employees who work in the capital city, wants all workers to have a 1 percent raise for every year they did not get a raise, plus 1 percent going forward.

""A one-time bonus is not a raise,"" she said.

Florida leaders anticipate a budget surplus this year, but they’re not sure how much will be on hand until estimates are completed in March. That has not stopped interest groups from already clamoring for funds after a years-long dry spell.

Sen. Bill Montford, D-Tallahassee, told the Tallahassee Democrat he will introduce a 4 percent salary hike for state workers.  Rep. Dwayne Taylor, D-Daytona Beach, introduced a bill that would give state employees a 2 percent raise, and Sen. Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, is co-sponsoring the measure in the Florida Senate.

Two percent may be what’s feasible, Rehwinkel Vasilinda said, but it does not go far enough.

""(Taylor) was doing what he thought was probable and that it would not be a radical departure than what’s gone on the past six years,"" she said in an interview with PolitiFact Florida.

Scott has said he will again ask the Legislature to provide money for agency heads to dole out performance-based raises to high-performing employees, but we won’t know the details until he releases his 2013-14 budget recommendations, which will be released by Feb. 3. The Senate’s budget chief, Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, has said he would rather address pay inequities at certain agencies than give across-the-board raises.

Rehwinkel Vasilinda’s bill uses statistics to bolster the case for Florida workers getting a salary bump. Florida may be on track to be the third-most populous state, but in 2011 its state worker-to-resident ratio was the lowest in the nation. At 112 workers to 10,000 residents, Florida’s ratio was 47.4 percent lower than the national average.

Florida also spends less money on its state government workforce than any other state. According to DMS, Florida’s 2011 payroll expenditure per state resident was $37, which is 50 percent less than the national average of state government payroll expenditures of $74.

Our ruling

Rehwinkel Vasilinda claimed state workers have not had a raise in six years. She’s correct that they have not had an across-the-board raise since Oct. 1, 2006.

The context of her quote makes it clear she was referring to raises for all state workers, so we rate her claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBD3500>],/factchecks/2013/jan/29/michelle-rehwinkel-vasilinda/state-workers-have-gone-six-years-without-raises-s/
