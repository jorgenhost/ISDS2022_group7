No evidence that Maine Senate candidate Sara Gideon used her power for ‘coverup’
","The serenity of the Pine Tree State is being broken by personal attacks that aren’t faring too well on our Truth-O-Meter. In a Maine race that could help decide whether the GOP keeps control of the U.S. Senate, Republican incumbent Sen. Susan Collins and her Democratic challenger Sara Gideon have made a number of factually problematic claims against one another. Now, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is targeting Gideon.  A TV ad sponsored by the group claims that when Gideon ""knew the truth about"" sexual allegations against a state lawmaker, ""she could have called for an immediate (ethics) investigation, but didn’t…Gideon knew for months, using her power to cover up."" Collins has been a U.S. senator since 1997. Gideon has served in Maine’s state House since 2013 and as its speaker since 2016.  The Cook Political Report rates the race a tossup that could help decide whether Republicans, who have 53 seats in the Senate, maintain their majority. It is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. The ad’s narrator refers to the case of Democratic Rep. Dillon Bates, a teacher and coach who it says ""used his power (and) sexually preyed on his teenage students."" Here’s a timeline of the case: Aug. 3, 2018 — Bates accused: The Bollard, then a monthly magazine published in Portland, Maine, posted an article claiming that Bates had ""engaged in at least three romantic and/or sexual relationships with high school girls over the past half decade."" One of the three was quoted anonymously in the article. Aug. 4, 2018 — Gideon calls for Bates’ resignation: Gideon, citing the article, called for Bates’ resignation. Her spokeswoman Mary-Erin Casale acknowledged that Gideon had known about the misconduct accusations for several months prior and said: ""At that point, we told Rep. Bates that if any evidence or new information was presented that indicated there could be truth to what was then a rumor, that we would ask him to resign immediately."" Aug. 6, 2018 — Bates quits coaching job; Gideon says there was no evidence previously: Bates, who denied the allegations, resigned from a high school coaching job. He had resigned abruptly from a separate teaching job in November 2017, saying at the time of the resignation he did so for family reasons, according to a Aug. 6, 2018 story in the Portland Press Herald. The newspaper also  quoted Casale as saying that when Gideon first heard about the rumors: ""We confronted Rep. Bates immediately, who denied the rumor, and we were unable to otherwise find any substantiation, actual proof or evidence of any victims of the allegations."" Aug. 20, 2018 — Bates resigns House seat: Bates called the allegations baseless, but resigned less than two weeks after a Republican state representative called for a House Ethics Committee session regarding the allegations. He was never charged with a crime. On Oct. 8, 2020, Gideon said in a radio interview that no individuals alleging acts by Bates had come forward until The Bollard article. ""Before that, there was nothing but a rumor,"" she said. The National Republican Senatorial Committee said that when Gideon ""knew the truth about"" sexual allegations against a state lawmaker, ""she could have called for an immediate investigation, but didn’t…Gideon knew for months, using her power to cover up."" There is no evidence that Gideon knew ""the truth."" She said that in early 2018 she heard rumors about the allegations, but did not know of any proof. There is also no evidence she took any action to cover up the matter. When a news article made the allegations public, Gideon called on the lawmaker to resign. We rate the statement Mostly False.

"['City Budget', 'Crime', 'Texas', 'Greg Abbott']","
Examining Austin's property crime trends
","As part of a sustained campaign to criticize the Austin City Council’s August decision to cut police funding, Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted on Oct. 1: ""Property crime rising in Austin This is the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police. Residents are left to fend for themselves."" The tweet cited a KVUE article that highlighted an advisory from the Austin Police Department warning residents to secure their homes before going on a trip. The article noted 2,983 burglaries had occurred through the first eight months of this year — an 11% increase over the first eight months of last year, according to the Austin Police Department’s August crime report. But burglary is not the only form of property crime, and Abbott’s assertion that property crime is rising in Austin fails to take that into account. Property crime generally has been falling in Austin, with the notable recent exceptions of 2018 and 2019. So far this year, property crime has dropped slightly. And Abbott’s attempt to link crime to the City Council’s budget decision misses the mark. It’s not the first time Abbott has sounded off on Austin crime. In August, Abbott claimed that crime is on the rise in Austin, citing data that showed a jump in homicides over the first six months of the year. We rated that claim Half True. Austin’s property crime Each month, the Austin Police Department posts to its website the Chief’s Monthly Report, which tallies the number and category of crimes officers respond to each month. The 2,983 burglaries cited in the KVUE article comprise 9% of all property crimes recorded through August. Other crimes that fall into this category include shoplifting, credit card fraud, embezzlement and vandalism. Austin police responded to nearly 34,000 total property crimes through August, which is a 2% drop compared with 2019. According to FBI data, property crime in Austin increased in 2018 by 8.5% and in 2019 by 8.7%. But taking a longer view, the property crime rate has generally been falling over the last decade. In addition to 2018 and 2019, the only other year since 2010 when the rate did not drop compared to the previous year was in 2012. In 2010 Austin police responded to nearly 46,000 reports of property crime, or about 5.8 incidents per 100 residents, according to federal data. In 2019, officers responded to 36,588 reports, or about 3.7 incidents per 100 residents. Burglaries specifically also have been dropping, from about 1.1 incidents per 100 residents in 2010 to about 0.4 in 2019. Abbott is not the only Texas elected official who’s rebuked Austin leaders for cutting the Austin police budget. Several other Republicans have seized on Austin’s police spending as an issue in their reelection campaigns. The perception of high crime in Austin reflects a popular misconception that crime is always on the rise despite a general downward trend, said Texas State University criminologist Sean Roche. On average, crime in the U.S. has declined since the mid-1990s to historically low and stable levels. That’s generally true for Austin’s property crime rates as well. Federal data going back to 1985 show a peak of property crime incidents in 1990 followed by a decade of low property crime until a smaller peak in 2009. ""Even though crime went up in the 60s, 70s and 80s and then started declining in the 90s, most of the public did not ever catch wise of this,"" Roche said. ""There’s a significant chunk of people in the U.S. that always think crime is getting worse."" Some researchers have suggested that a false perception of high crime may be attributable to a person’s level of media exposure, especially local TV news. A study published in 2018 by Roche and colleagues note that this misperception may have significant implications for criminal justice policies, which are ""particularly sensitive to public opinion"" compared to other policy domains. ""Over-concern about crime is likely to mobilize the public to be more punitive, thereby fueling support for increased law enforcement spending and harsh sentencing policies,"" Roche and his coauthors wrote. ""Public punitiveness is one of the strongest predictors of both federal and state incarceration rates."" Crime and police budgets After asserting that the property crime rate in Austin is rising, Abbott’s tweet goes on to claim that rising crime is ""the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police."" It’s unclear what the governor means when he says ""deemphasize police"" — his office did not respond to multiple requests for comment — but we can be sure what city he’s referring to when talking about defunding. The Austin City Council recently decided to cut $21.5 million from the police budget and shifted another $128 million from the Police Department to other city departments to continue civilian-run functions, such as the 911 call center and forensics. The cuts came after protests against police brutality in Austin and across the nation demanded police reforms in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody in May. But how the council’s budgetary decisions will affect the department’s daily operations, especially in regard to property crime, is not yet known. ""In terms of staffing changes, that’s something we’re still working on,"" said Austin police spokeswoman Tara Long. ""We’re still working on those specifics."" Austin Police Chief Brian Manley indicated in August that the department may reduce or eliminate about a dozen police units while reassigning those officers to patrol duties. The cuts also will cancel three upcoming cadet classes and reduce overtime spending. But does a smaller police force automatically heighten crime? Research would suggest that there is a weak or nonexistent connection between the two. One systematic review by criminologists at the University of Cincinnati concludes that the overall effect of police force size on crime is ""statistically not significant,"" although it is possible that force size might influence some crimes more than others. ""Policy makers who want police to have an impact on crime would be better suited investing resources in new evidence-based strategies than funding surges in police hiring,"" the 2016 review says. Rather, crime trends are more influenced by macro-level drivers, like the prevalence of firearms in a community, alcohol consumption, drug use, unemployment and a population’s age structure, Roche said. ""Austin, on average, has historically been a very safe city,"" he said. ""It’s premature to say definitively that a budget decision that was made a couple months ago has already had these very dramatic impacts on crime rates. We just don’t know."" Our ruling Abbott’s tweet made two factual claims: that property crime in Austin is on the rise and that this increase is causally linked to the city’s police budget cuts. He based the first on figures presented in a KVUE article that cited an 11% increase in burglaries so far this year. However, property crime on the whole is not rising this year. In fact, it has dropped by 2% compared to last year. Although property crime increased slightly in 2018 and 2019, property crime has dropped significantly over the past decade. The article Abbott referenced also cited data that showed crime rates as of August, which is before cuts to APD’s budget took effect on Oct. 1. The second part of his claim, that increased property crime is ""the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police,"" appears to be based on assumption. Researchers have demonstrated how numerous intervening factors confound the relationship between police force size and crime. Rather, strategic crime deterrent strategies are seen as having a more direct impact on crime rates. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097093F80>],/factchecks/2020/oct/09/greg-abbott/examining-austins-property-crime-trends/
"['History', 'Facebook Fact-checks', 'Nikki Haley']","
No, Khrushchev didn’t say this about Americans 60 years ago
","In a recent social media post, Nikki Haley — former governor of South Carolina and U.S. ambassador to the U.N. — attributed a nefarious-sounding quote about socialism to Soviet Union leader Nikita Khrushchev. ""Khrushchev 60 years ago…"" she wrote in the Oct. 5 Facebook post, before continuing on to provide the supposed Khrushchev quote:  ""Your children's children will live under communism. You Americans are so gullible. No, you won't accept communism outright; but, we will keep feeding you small doses of socialism until you will finally wake up and find you already have Communism."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  There is no evidence Khrushchev, who led the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964, ever said this about Americans, though this quote and similar ones have been attributed to Khrushchev by people including President Ronald Reagan and staunch anti-communist Ezra Taft Benson, former secretary of agriculture. PolitiFact attempted to reach out to Haley on social media and through the organization she founded, Stand For America, to see if she had evidence to back up her claim. She did not respond to our request for comment. In the Nikita Khrushchev section of a book titled ""They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, and Misleading Attributions,"" a version of this quote is listed: ""You Americans are so gullible. No, you won’t accept Communism outright, but we’ll keep feeding you small doses of Socialism until you’ll finally wake up and find you already have Communism. We won’t have to fight you. We’ll so weaken your economy until you’ll fall like an overripe fruit into our hands."" According to the book, the quote emerged and began circulating in the 1960s.  In 1961, Reagan — who was an actor and TV host at the time — attributed a version of the quote to Khrushchev in a speech, without providing evidence of its origin:  ""Three months before his last visit to this country, Nikita Khrushchev said, ‘We can't expect the American people to jump from capitalism to communism, but we can assist their elected leaders in giving them small doses of socialism, until they awaken one day to find they have communism.’"" In the late 1960s, anti-communist Ezra Taft Benson claimed Khrushchev said these things during his 1959 visit to the United States. Benson recounted his exchange with Khrushchev in a speech he delivered in 1966:  ""I have talked face-to-face with the godless Communist leaders. It may surprise you to learn that I was host to Mr. Khrushchev for a half day, when he visited the United States. ... ""As we talked face-to-face, he indicated that my grandchildren would live under Communism. After assuring him that I expected to do all in my power to assure that his, and all other grandchildren, would live under freedom, he arrogantly declared, in substance: ""‘You Americans are so gullible. No you won’t accept communism outright, but we’ll keep feeding you small doses of socialism until you’ll finally wake up and you find you already have communism. We won’t have to fight you. We’ll so weaken your economy until you fall like over-ripe fruit into our hands.’"" But Benson’s account has been questioned because he also attributed those words to Khrushchev in a book he wrote in 1962. In that instance, Benson wrote that the Soviet leader made the statement months before his trip to the U.S., and Benson did not claim Khrushchev said them to him one-on-one.  In terms of what Khrushchev said publicly, the Soviet leader’s 1959 speeches in the U.S. were documented by news outlets and others. The book ""Khrushchev in America"" compiled Khrushchev’s speeches during the 1959 trip, and the full text is searchable online. But when PolitiFact reviewed the speeches and searched for key phrases — including ""doses of socialism"" and ""Americans are so gullible"" — we did not find any indication that Khrushchev said the things attributed to him in the Facebook post. On Facebook, Haley quoted Khrushchev as saying, ""Your children's children will live under communism. You Americans are so gullible. No, you won't accept communism outright; but, we will keep feeding you small doses of socialism until you will finally wake up and find you already have Communism."" Apart from one anecdotal claim from an individual whose story was inconsistent, there is no evidence Khrushchev said any variation of this quote.

Kamala Harris didn’t frame and prosecute a man for murder
","Years before she became a senator and the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Kamala Harris was the district attorney of San Francisco. Recent Facebook posts have drawn attention to the case of a man who was arrested and convicted during that time.  ""An appellate court found Kamela Harris and San Francisco police took part in framing and prosecuting a man named Jamal Trulove for a murder he didn’t commit?"" the post says, misspelling Harris’ first name. ""Harris even paid the key witness over $60,000 in housing and relocation benefits for testifying against Jamal so she could get the conviction before election. After years behind bars and even being stabbed while in prison, Jamal was exonerated and paid a $13.1 million dollar settlement by the city of SF. Kamela Harris ruined this man’s life so she could get the vote.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Here’s what we know.  In October 2008, Jamal Trulove was arrested in the fatal shooting of Seu Kuka near a public housing project in San Francisco, according to an account of Trulove’s case on the National Registry of Exonerations website. A witness named Priscilla Lualemaga had said Trulove looked ""like the guy who could have shot"" Kuka after police presented her with a photo lineup and said they had identified the gunman. She later told police that her identification of Trulove was reinforced when she saw him in an episode of a reality TV show. He was charged with first-degree murder committed with a firearm.  The case went to trial in January 2010, when Lualemaga said she was sure that Trulove was the killer. She said that she hadn’t originally expressed that confidence to police because she was afraid Trulove’s family or friends would seek revenge if she testified. She said the prosecution had placed her in witness protection. Harris wasn’t the prosecutor. That job fell to one of her deputies, Linda Allen, who said jurors should believe Lualemaga because she had risked her life to testify. They convicted Trulove, and he was sentenced to 50 years to life in prison. The San Francisco Chronicle reported after Trulove’s conviction that Harris credited the ""brave eyewitness who stepped forward from the crowd."" A lawyer for Trulove appealed the conviction, and the appeals court agreed with him that the prosecution had wrongly said without providing evidence that Lualemaga had faced threats that made her afraid for her life.The court also found that Trulove’s original lawyer had provided ineffective counsel. The case was remanded for a new trial.  Experts who testified for the defense said in the second trial that based on ballistics evidence, Kuka was shot by someone else, and Lualemaga wouldn’t have been able to see far enough down the street to witness the killing. The jury acquitted Trulove. In January 2016, Trulove filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city and county of San Francisco and 12 police officers and inspectors for malicious prosecution. Harris wasn’t named, and neither she nor Allen was named in the court’s opinion in the case, though ""the prosecution"" is mentioned throughout.   Trulove alleged that police had fabricated evidence, coerced a key witness and withheld exonerating evidence. About two years later, the court sided with Trulove, concluding that police framed him for murder. A federal jury decided that two detectives had violated his civil rights — deliberately fabricating evidence and failing to disclose exculpatory evidence — and awarded $14.5 million to Trulove and his lawyers. The case was settled for $13.1 million in exchange for the city dropping its appeal of the verdict.  Trulove’s complaint in the civil case said that Lualemaga ""had been paid over $60,000 in living expenses in exchange for her testimony."" According to the court opinion in Trulove’s appeal, she was placed in witness protection by the district attorney’s office. Lualemaga ""said she discussed her fears with a prosecutor, Fleming, before the preliminary hearing. She discussed the hardships she endured in the program, including that she, her husband, and their one year old child moved into one hotel, then another, and then another location.""   Lualemaga received $875 per month for meals and between $1,350 and $2,500 per month for lodging and storage fees.  Before he was acquitted, Trulove spent years in maximum security prisons, where he was stabbed, a lawyer for Trulove said. In October 2019, when Harris was a presidential candidate, Vice published a story with the headline: ""Kamala Harris’ prosecutors sent this innocent man to prison for murder. Now he’s talking."" Trulove said Harris was in the courtroom for his original guilty verdict and for his sentencing, according to the story. ""She even locked eyes with him at one of the proceedings, offering what seemed like a ‘smirk,’ he said."" Vice quotes Trulove as saying Harris ""wanted to be present for a celebration of a conviction."" The publication also cites a 2019 New York Times op-ed by law professor Lara Bazelon, who criticizes Harris’ record as a prosecutor. As attorney general of California, Bazelon wrote, ""Harris fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony and the suppression of crucial information by prosecutors.""  The piece does not mention Trulove’s case. Let’s revisit the claim.  The post says: An appellate court found Kamela Harris and San Francisco police took part in framing and prosecuting a man named Jamal Trulove for a murder he didn’t commit. This conflates two cases. The first case was a criminal case against Trulove, in which he successfully appealed his murder conviction and was acquitted on retrial.The second case is the civil suit Trulove filed against the city and county of San Francisco and several police officers and inspectors. The jury in that case found that police framed Trulove.  Harris, who was district attorney when the criminal charges against Trulove went to trial, did not prosecute the case — one of her deputies did. But she did echo that prosecutor’s support for the witness who identified Trulove as the shooter.  Harris is not named in the civil suit.  The post says: Harris even paid the key witness over $60,000 in housing and relocation benefits for testifying against Jamal so she could get the conviction before election.  A complaint filed by Trulove said that Lualemaga ""had been paid over $60,000 in living expenses in exchange for her testimony."" Other court filings reported that Lualemaga was placed in witness protection by the district attorney’s office and received $875 per month for meals and between $1,350 and $2,500 per month for lodging and storage fees.  The Dispatch Fact-Check, which also looked into this claim, concluded that it’s ""unclear how long these benefits lasted based on available public documents.""  We reached out to the district attorney’s office to ask about the total sum paid to Lualemaga but did not immediately receive a reply.  The post says: After years behind bars and even being stabbed while in prison, Jamal was exonerated and paid a $13.1 million settlement by the city of SF.  Jama did spend years in prison, and his lawyer said he was stabbed while incarcerated. After appealing his conviction, he was acquitted by the jury in a retrial.  The city of San Francisco did pay him a $13.1 million settlement.   Our ruling An appellate court did not find that Harris and San Francisco police framed and prosecuted Trulove for a murder he didn’t commit. But after Trulove was acquitted in a second criminal trial, he prevailed in a civil suit filed against the city and county of San Francisco and city police for framing him for murder, according to court filings.  Harris didn’t prosecute the criminal case against Trulove, but she was district attorney at the time, and an appellate court concluded that he deserved a new trial because his lawyer didn’t take ""any action in the face of highly prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct."" According to court filings, the district attorney’s office also placed Lualemaga in witness protection but we don’t know exactly how much she received from the office to pay for her room and board.  The Facebook post accurately describes some elements of Trulove’s saga, but it gets other parts wrong and exaggerates Harris’ role in the case.  We rate this post Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BA6300>],/factchecks/2020/oct/09/viral-image/harris-didnt-frame-and-prosecute-man-murder/

U.S. Rep. Grothman off base with claim that COVID bill strips states' right to administer elections
","Congress is fighting once again over the best way to provide relief to Americans as the coronavirus continues to infect people across the country and clobber the economy.  
House Democrats passed a $2.2 trillion relief package on Oct. 1, 2020, that would provide another round of enhanced unemployment benefits and stimulus checks, as well as support for schools and businesses.  The vote came amid frayed talks with the White House and just hours before President Donald Trump announced he had tested positive for COVID-19. (Trump has since called the talks off, then suggested he wanted to continue negotiations) Republican U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, who voted against the House stimulus package, characterized the legislation in an Oct. 4, 2020, newsletter as a ""partisan spending bill"" and pointed to several provisions he deemed ""egregious."" One of them: The bill, he said, ""strips states of their right to administer elections.""  Is Grothman right?  When asked for evidence to support Grothman’s claim, a spokesman referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to several provisions in the bill related to elections. Among them: States would be required to create contingency plans for federal elections in the event of an emergency or natural disaster and update that plan at least every five years. States that don’t meet those requirements could face civil action from the attorney general. States must provide early voting at least 15 days before an election and allow voting to occur at least 10 hours each day. They would not be permitted to require identification to obtain an absentee ballot or require a witness signature for an absentee ballot to be counted. Election officials would be required to accept ballots mailed on or before Election Day and received within 10 days after the election. States that require voter identification at the polls would have to give voters the opportunity to provide a signed statement attesting to their identity.  Democrats first introduced these requirements, dubbed the American Coronavirus/COVID-19 Election Safety and Security Act, as part of the HEROES Act they unsuccessfully pushed earlier this year. ""I’d also like to add that states may already have some of these same procedures in place,"" Grothman spokesman Timothy Svoboda said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""However, that does not change the fact that the authority would now be at the federal level."" Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said he thinks under the measure states could tailor the rules to their own needs, but noted the bill is a ""pretty substantial involvement of the federal government."" ""In some other states, it would require a significant change of their laws,"" he said That said, the measure doesn’t tackle some key aspects of the voting system, such as residency requirements or who can work at the polls. And the measure would only apply to federal elections, which occur in November every two years. States could still create their own rules for local elections. Who’s really in charge of elections, anyway? The U.S. Constitution says state legislatures can prescribe the ""times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,"" but goes on to give Congress the ability to make or alter such rules. According to an analysis of the clause, Congress’ primary duty is to uphold the integrity of the election process and right to vote.  ""States, territories, and the District of Columbia have primary responsibility for administering elections in the United States, but Congress retains authority over the time, place, and manner of federal elections,"" states a July 16, 2020 memo from the Congressional Research Service. The memo goes on to say that Congress could consider expanded mail voting requirements in response to the coronavirus pandemic, but noted that ""states, territories, and the District of Columbia … might reject new federal requirements as an infringement on their authority to conduct elections or new funding that comes attached to such requirements."" Burden said Congress has taken a larger role in federal elections over time, often to provide a more uniform voting experience and protect vulnerable groups.  The Help America Vote Act, for example, created mandates for voting equipment and required states to implement a computerized voter registration list, among other provisions. Still, Burden said, ""states will always run their elections."" Let’s return to Grothman’s claim, that the measure ""strips states of their right to administer elections.""  Merriam-Webster defines ""administer"" as ""to manage or supervise the execution, use, or conduct of."" Nothing about the House-passed legislation takes away the ability of states to administer elections. Grothman may oppose the proposed requirements, but suggesting states will lose that right and responsibility is simply not accurate.  In a newsletter, Grothman said a newly approved coronavirus relief package ""strips states of their right to administer elections."" The legislation would create a new baseline for how states conduct federal elections, including rules for absentee and early voting, and outlines several requirements that some states don’t currently have in place. But states would still be responsible for administering elections. What’s more, this is far from the first time Congress has considered measures to make the voting process more uniform.  We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C134240>],/factchecks/2020/oct/09/glenn-grothman/us-rep-grothman-base-claim-covid-bill-strips-state/

Trump whiffs describing Wisconsin ballot case
","In the runup to the November election, President Donald Trump has relentlessly attacked the integrity of mail-in ballots, even though he has voted by mail himself and claims of widespread fraud in this vein have been regularly proven wrong. So it’s not surprising this topic surfaced again in the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, 2020. What caught our attention was that, it turned out, one of his claims had a Wisconsin twist. ""As far as the ballots are concerned, it's a disaster,"" Trump said in the debate. ""They're sending millions of ballots all over the country. There's fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket."" Several minutes later he circled back to the waterway claim amid another rundown of supposed fraud. ""Did you see what's going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots,"" Trump claimed. ""They're being sold. They're being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country. … This is not going to end well."" News reports have noted the West Virginia mail sale claim is wrong  — a worker was charged for altering five ballot requests (not ballots themselves), but no money was involved – and the wastebasket incident in Pennsylvania was a new employee’s mistake rather than fraud. But we’ll focus on the creek and river claim. During a contentious exchange with a reporter two days later, Kayleigh McEnany, President Trump's press secretary, said Trump was actually referring to trays of mail found in ""a ditch in Wisconsin."" Let’s see how Trump’s description lines up with reality. Mail-in voting is a critical topic given the unprecedented volume of pandemic-fueled mail-in voting already occurring in the Nov. 3 election. It’s also a touchy subject in Wisconsin, where several ballot issues cropped up during the April election. Some 2,693 Milwaukee voters didn’t receive the absentee ballots they requested, and 1,600 ballots in the Appleton and Oshkosh areas were found at a mail processing center the day after the election, and went uncounted. Meanwhile, the U.S. Postal Service has come under fire for making operational changes that critics say were slowing mail delivery ahead of the election — changes a federal judge temporarily blocked in September. But experts have repeatedly said there is no evidence of widespread fraud through mail-in voting, now or in the past. ""What (Trump) said (at the debate) was full of misstatements and inaccuracies,"" Lawrence Norden, director of the Election Reform Program for the Brennan Center for Justice, told USA Today the day after the debate. ""Mail-in ballots are safe and secure. We’ve been voting in some form by mail since the Civil War. FBI Director Christopher Wray, who Trump appointed, told Congress in September the agency has not seen evidence of a ""coordinated national voter fraud effort,"" the New York Times reported. Three trays of mail were found ""on the side of the road and in the ditch line"" in the Outagamie County town of Greenville the morning of Sept. 21, according to the county sheriff’s office. Public details on the incident remain limited. The sheriff said the trays had been on their way to the post office and contained an assortment of mail, including ""several"" absentee ballots. McEnany pointed to this incident in her Sept. 24 press briefing at the White House while asserting mass mail-out voting is a ""system that’s subject to fraud.""  Wisconsin, however, does not use that system, where ballots are sent to everyone in the state without being specifically requested.  But the narrative shifted a bit two days after the debate. Meagan Wolfe, director of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, announced that no Wisconsin absentee ballots were actually found in Greenville. She said she didn’t know if there were ballots from other states. No clarification was given on this potentially conflicting information. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service, which is investigating the matter, declined to provide additional information to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Officials have not said who had possession of the ballots or how they came to be in the ditch.  While claiming there is widespread mail voting fraud, President Trump said ballots in Wisconsin ""are being dumped in rivers"" or creeks. In context, viewers were left with the impression that ballots were disposed of en masse in some sort of waterway. There’s no evidence of that. We base our ratings on what is known at the time of the claim. And on Sept. 29, as is the case now, Trump’s statement was wrong in both the literal claim (a ""river"") and the implication (that this is evidence of fraud). A small number of ballots were found with hundreds of pieces of other mail, and authorities have said nothing to indicate election manipulation motivated the incident.  The information released after the debate — that no Wisconsin ballots were found — muddles the situation given the apparent conflict with earlier information. But it doesn’t change this rating. We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809783D380>],/factchecks/2020/oct/09/donald-trump/trump-whiffs-describing-wisconsin-ballot-case/

Fact-checking Pence’s claim on Democrats and abortion ‘up to the moment of birth’
","In his debate appearance Oct. 7, Vice President Mike Pence sought to spotlight the difference between the Republican and Democratic candidates over abortion rights. ""I’m pro-life, I don’t apologize for it. This is another one of those cases where there’s such a dramatic contrast,"" Pence said in Salt Lake City. ""Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth, late term abortion."" During the debate, Harris shook her head as Pence made his claim, but she did not directly address his statement. Before his claim, Harris had said she would ""always fight for a woman's right to make a decision about her own body."" On taxpayer funding, both Biden and Harris say they want to get rid of the Hyde Amendment, a provision routinely added to health budget bills that bars federal funding for abortions. Biden came out against it in 2019. Readers asked PolitiFact to fact-check the other part of the claim, whether the Democratic nominees support abortion ""up to the moment of birth."" Biden and Harris have not said they support abortion ""up to the moment of birth."" They say they support Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that legalized abortion while giving states the authority to regulate it after a certain point. They also say they would work to codify the ruling into law and try to stop state laws that violate provisions of the case. Biden’s campaign specified to PolitiFact that he supports Roe — as amended by another 1992 U.S. Supreme Court case, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania vs. Casey. Some experts say that case actually broadened states’ rights to regulate abortions, and that support for either of those cases does not amount to support for abortion ""up to the moment of birth."" Pence's spokesperson said that his claim is backed by Biden’s overall support for Roe and his plan to defend and codify it. A law professor and director of a center that opposes abortions said that Doe vs. Bolton, a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court companion case to Roe, should also be considered. She said that case has a broad health exception for abortions that makes Pence’s claim fair. Experts agreed on this: Many people, including politicians, don’t have a complete understanding of the provisions of court cases on abortion. ""Part of why this is such a mess is because different people mean different things"" when they talk about abortion-related U.S. Supreme Court cases, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University. ""There's not an established popular understanding of the court cases."" The rulings are complex, Ziegler said, and Pence and Biden may be focusing on different aspects of them. While an abortion opponent may interpret the cases as allowing abortions ""up to the moment of birth,"" supporters of abortion rights may not see it that way, she said. Still, when talking colloquially about support for Roe, most people mean recognizing the existence of a right to have an abortion, or not criminalizing it, Zeigler said. Supporting the rulings in Roe, Doe or Casey is not the same as supporting abortion ""up to the moment of birth,"" she said. Roe vs. Wade recognized a woman’s constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy, but it also allowed states to restrict abortions — including banning them altogether — after the point of fetal viability, except when the life or health of the woman is at stake, said Darren Hutchinson, a law professor at the University of Florida. He said that case did not specify a precise time for viability, but 24 weeks’ gestation has widely been used in medicine and law. In 2016, there were 623,471 legal induced abortions reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 1.2% happened at 21 weeks’ gestation or later, the CDC said. Roe allows states to restrict or ban abortions once a fetus is viable, Hutchinson said, so when opponents of abortion rights invoke the term ""up to the moment of birth,"" they are generally referring to how court cases treat exceptions to those restrictions during that period. Doe vs. Bolton allows doctors to consider a wide range of factors when determining whether an abortion is for health reasons, said Teresa Stanton Collett, a law professor and director of the Prolife Center at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis. A doctor may make a decision ""in the light of all factors physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age relevant to the well-being of the patient,"" that case said. ""Because it was a companion case and directly referenced in Roe vs. Wade, I believe it is fair to say that it supports abortion up to the moment of birth, given the breadth of the health exception,"" Collett said. Collette said that Biden's support for Roe should also be read in the context of the Democratic Party's platform. That platform says a Biden administration would seek to ""overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to women’s reproductive health and rights, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment and protecting and codifying the right to reproductive freedom."" She also argued that Democratic bills propose standards that would ""virtually eliminate abortion restrictions"" sought by states. Other experts said it’s important to not overlook the 1992 U.S. Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania vs. Casey. There’s a tendency to use Roe as shorthand when talking about keeping abortion legal, but the Casey ruling recognized a state's interest in pregnancy at all stages, said Mindy Jane Roseman, director of the Gruber Program for Global Justice and Women's Rights at Yale Law School. Before fetal viability, the state has an interest in making sure a woman is informed of her options and that any abortion procedures are safe, Roseman said. ""After viability, the state can prohibit abortions except where a woman's life is endangered, and possibly where her health is at grave risk,"" she said. Casey allowed states to regulate abortion throughout the pregnancy, so long as the state laws do not impose an ""undue burden"" on a woman's right to an abortion. The ruling also said that states may not prohibit pre-viability abortions. Pence’s spokesperson also flagged a February Senate procedural vote on a bill to ban abortion after about 20 weeks’ gestation — earlier than traditional measures of fetal viability, an expert said. Harris was among Democrats who voted against ending debate on the proposal, a move that effectively stopped the bill’s progress. ""The only exceptions in the bill were for life-saving abortions or when a pregnancy resulted from rape or incest,"" Hutchinson said, and the Supreme Court ""has consistently held that laws categorically banning abortions after viability must have life and health exceptions."" Harris has sought to have that standard written into law. She is a co-sponsor of a bill seeking to establish a statutory right for health care providers to provide ""abortion care free from medically unnecessary restrictions and bans."" The Center for Reproductive Rights said the bill would prohibit states from imposing post-viability bans that do not make exceptions for a woman’s health or life. There hasn’t been a vote on that bill. Biden’s campaign sent PolitiFact links to votes Biden cast as a senator in the 1990s and 2000s in support of banning ""partial-birth abortions."" That term refers generally to an abortion procedure where the fetus is removed intact from a woman’s body. Pence said Biden and Harris support abortion ""up to the moment of birth."" Biden and Harris have not said they support abortion ""up to the moment of birth."" They say they support the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized abortion and allowed states to regulate it after fetal viability. They also say they are against state laws that conflict with the case, and would work to codify the ruling into law. One expert said that Democrats’ intent to codify Roe could preempt state laws restricting abortion, and that a related case has a health exception broad enough to allow abortions ""up to the moment of birth."" But several other experts said that supporting Roe or related cases is not the same as supporting abortion ""up to the moment of birth."" They said that generally, people who support Roe mean they support the existence of a right to have an abortion or to not criminalize it. Pence’s claim creates a wrong impression of Biden’s and Harris’ statements and of the common interpretation of cases that affirmed abortion rights. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097226300>],/factchecks/2020/oct/09/mike-pence/fact-checking-pences-claim-democrats-and-abortion-/

Ad Watch: Kamala Harris doesn’t want to ‘defund, dismantle and dissolve’ the police
","Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris is the former attorney general of California. She has called herself the state’s ""top cop."" But Vice President Mike Pence said she would defund the police if Joe Biden is elected president. ""As vice president, Kamala Harris would: defund, dismantle, and dissolve police departments,"" says a Facebook ad published by Pence’s Facebook page Oct. 8, the day after the vice presidential debate in Salt Lake City. ""Americans can’t afford the radical left’s agenda,"" reads a message at the bottom, which links to a fundraising page for President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign.  The ad stands in contrast to some of the Trump campaign’s other messaging on Harris, which has criticized her as an overzealous prosecutor. We reached out to Pence’s press office, as well as the Trump campaign, for evidence or a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Setting aside whether Harris could, as vice president, single-handedly dismantle police departments, is it true that she supports defunding the police? We took a closer look. (Screenshot from the Facebook Ad Library) Pence’s ad is wrong. The Biden campaign says his administration would not work to defund the police, and Harris has not explicitly said she supports those calls. The official Biden campaign platform does not support defunding or dismantling police departments. Harris’ former presidential campaign platform doesn’t mention it. Following the death of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis police custody in May, activists protesting against police brutality started to call for defunding the police. While some activists said they wanted to eliminate police departments entirely, others said lawmakers should reroute some of their funding toward other community services. Biden says in his platform that, if he were elected, he ""will not defund the police."" We’ve previously rated several claims False for saying the opposite. Biden says he would invest more money in local law enforcement. ""He will condition federal funding on departments undertaking reforms,"" the platform says. ""And, he will invest an additional $300 million in community-oriented policing, so officers can get out of their cruisers and get to know the communities they serve."" Harris, who co-sponsored a Senate bill that calls for criminal justice reform, also hasn’t said she wants to dismantle or dissolve police departments. When Harris was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, her criminal justice platform did not mention defunding or dismantling police departments. Her plan called for increasing funding for things like body cameras, mental health professionals, and ""officer safety and wellness."" ""Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not support defunding the police, and it is a lie to suggest otherwise,"" said Sabrina Singh, Harris’ press secretary. ""Throughout her career, Sen. Harris has supported increasing funding to police departments and boosting funding for community policing."" While Harris has called for ""reimagining"" public safety in the United States, she has not said she supports defunding police departments. In an early June episode of ""The View,"" host Meghan McCain asked Harris:""Are you for defunding the police?""  After some back-and-forth about the definition, Harris demurred. ""We need to reimagine how we are achieving public safety in America,"" she said. ""To have cities where one-thrid of their entire budget is going to policing, but yet there is a dire need in those same cities for mental health resources, for resources going into public schools, for resources going into job training and job creation — come on. We have to be honest about this."" Harris has reiterated those talking points in several media appearances: On June 8, she said: ""We don’t want police officers to be dealing with the homeless issue. We don’t want police officers to be dealing with substance abuse and mental health. No — we should be putting those resources into our public health systems, we should be looking at our budgets and asking, ‘Are we getting the best return on our investment as taxpayers?’"" On June 25, she said: ""For far too long, the status quo thinking has been to believe that by putting more police on the street, you’re going to have more safety — and that’s just wrong."" On Sept. 6, she said: ""I want to make sure that if a woman is raped, a child is molested, one human being murders another human being, that there will be a police officer that responds to that case and that there will be accountability and consequence for the offender."" RELATED: ‘Defund the police’ movement: What do activists mean by that? While Harris has alluded to some key points of the ""defund the police"" movement, she hasn’t offered her support. The Hill reported in June that, before she joined the Biden campaign, Harris was trying to ""straddle the divide on the left over police reform."" Pence said in a Facebook ad that, as vice president, Harris would ""defund, dismantle, and dissolve police departments."" That’s wrong. Biden’s official campaign platform says his administration would not defund police departments. Harris’ press secretary said she does not support defunding the police. Her former presidential campaign platform did not mention it. In media appearances, Harris has called for ""reimagining"" public safety across the country. But she hasn’t explicitly said she supports defunding police departments, and Harris has said she doesn’t want to get rid of law enforcement. Pence’s ad is inaccurate.

Social posters spread election misinformation about “shredded” ballot applications for Donald Trump
","Clips of a video inside the back of a tractor-trailer are being falsely used on social media to stoke a fear that people are trying to rig the election against President Donald Trump. We’ve seen multiple versions of the same basic video online. A person is walking around the back of a tractor-trailer that has some trash at the bottom of it. He picks up some of the paper and sees an image of Trump pointing next to the phrase ""President Trump wants you to return this form."" The person flips the paper over and shows what looks like an application for a mail-in ballot in Pennsylvania. ""They do have people’s addresses on them that were never mailed out,"" the person says. ""Somebody sabotaged all (of) these,"" the person says in another clip. That was enough information for some people to say the video is evidence of voter fraud. One post on Twitter has nearly 22,000 retweets and the video has been viewed more than 400,000 times. ""Shredded Pennsylvania Mail in ballot Applications were discovered in a trailer. The applications were for @realDonaldTrump,"" says the caption. But that’s not what the video shows. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Let’s start with the mailers in the video. Here’s an image: (Screenshot via YouTube) The mailers include a return address of the Federal Republican Committee of Pennsylvania. That’s the official name for the Pennsylvania state Republican Party. The mailers are part of a nationwide effort by Republicans — despite the words of Trump — to encourage mail-in voting in 2020. A North Carolina voter posted on Twitter a version of the same mailer, but mailed by the North Carolina GOP. That poster, a Republican who says he’s a ""Never Trumper,"" did not request the mailer. Similar mailers were sent in Texas and Ohio. The mailers include forms that can be used by someone to request a mail-in ballot from a local election authority, and other groups are doing the same thing. It’s legal, so long as the groups sending the mailer comply with state and local laws. In Pennsylvania, you can also request a ballot through the state. But it’s also confusing. In September, NPR zeroed in on Lehigh County in Northeast Pennsylvania, where elections officials said some people had mailed in two or three ballot requests forms because they were confused. The mailers are not being requested by voters and are part of a bulk mail campaign to encourage mail-in voting. ""Part of the challenge here is that not only more people are sending out applications to voters, in order to make sure voters have an opportunity to vote by mail, but when voters do fill out multiple ones, because maybe they fill it out one day and then a week later because ... they haven't gotten the ballot,"" Tammy Patrick, the senior adviser of elections at Democracy Fund, told ABC News. (Democracy Fund provides some financial support to PolitiFact.) The video doesn’t show any completed applications, so there’s no evidence the applications are for Trump. In the case of the North Carolina voter who got a similar application request, he said he’s not voting for Trump. And regardless, you can’t apply to vote for someone. You can only apply for a ballot. The most important clue to debunk the video comes in a frame near the end that shows a sign for a business, ""R.R. Donnelley."" R.R. Donnelley is a company that, among other things, does direct mail services. (Screenshot via YouTube) We reached out R.R. Donnelley about the video. A spokeswoman for the company said the video shows printing waste. ""What you see in the Twitter video is residual print production waste in a trailer that was returned from a recycling facility,"" the company told us. ""The full extent of the client’s mailing request, applications for mail-in ballots, was produced and processed in accordance with our print and mail verification procedures. Recycling of print production waste is a normal practice associated with a direct mail project of this extent."" Posters took some cell phone video to claim that ""Shredded Pennsylvania Mail in ballot Applications were discovered in a trailer. The applications were for @realDonaldTrump."" A person in the video claimed this was part of sabotage. In reality, you’re looking at printing waste. We rate this claim False.

Biden’s tax proposal isn’t largest increase in U.S. history
","Preserve America PAC, a super PAC that supports President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, is running a 15-second Facebook ad bashing Biden for his tax plan.  ""Joe Biden is proposing a $4 trillion tax increase, the largest in American history,"" the narrator says. In public appearances, Trump has made similar claims, telling Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo that Biden ""want(s) to tax $4 trillion, it's going to be the biggest tax increase in history by far.""  Biden’s tax plan would seek to grow federal revenue by $3.6 trillion over the next decade, primarily by raising business taxes and taxes on households with incomes over $400,000 a year. But tax experts say his plan would not constitute the largest U.S. tax increase ever. Neither Trump nor the ad cited any evidence or sources for the claim. However, the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax policy organization, conducted a detailed analysis of the Biden tax plan and compared it with other historical tax increases.  The group evaluated the plans by comparing the federal revenue they generated with the total gross domestic product of the U.S. at the time, an ""apples to apples"" comparison, Garrett Watson, a policy analyst and co-author of the report, said in an interview.  They found that measured as a share of the economy, Biden’s plan would be the fifth largest of the 21 major tax bills passed since 1940. The Revenue Acts of 1941, 1942 and 1951, and the Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968 were all larger than the would-be Biden plan. This is the same type of analysis we applied to Trump’s claim that the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was the largest tax cut in American history, which we rated False.  According to Watson and his co-author Erica York, measuring tax increases in nominal dollars unadjusted for inflation and economic growth — the only measure by which Biden’s proposed tax increase would be the largest ever — would be misleading. As an example, York cited the Revenue Act of 1942, the largest tax increase dating back to 1940.  ""According to the Treasury Department, measured in nominal dollars, (the Act) raised $10 billion in its first year. But in today’s dollars, that would be approximately $160 billion, so looking at nominal dollars would be highly misleading,"" she explained in an email.  In its first year, the 1942 law increased federal revenue by 5.04% of GDP. If enacted in 2021, the Biden tax plan would increase revenue by an estimated 1.44% of GDP in its first year.  A PAC ad said Biden is proposing a tax increase that’s ""the largest in American history."" According to a detailed analysis by the Tax Foundation, Biden’s proposed tax increase would be the fifth largest since 1940, when measured as a share of the economy.

"['Vermont', 'David Zuckerman']","
Did Scott really propose to ‘cut schools,’ as Zuckerman claims?
","As the 2018 legislative session drew to a close, Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, and Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman, a Progressive-Democrat, found themselves on opposite sides of a dispute over school budgets that briefly absorbed the attention of many in Montpelier.  During a debate last week, the two major party candidates for governor had competing recollections of what exactly went down.  Zuckerman said that part of the job for him and his Democratic colleagues in the Statehouse has been serving as a ""backstop"" to guard against proposals from the governor, if lawmakers have reason to believe they might hurt Vermonters.  ""They’ve pushed back against a number of your budgets, including when you were going to cut schools, when you were going to cut teachers and educators in our schools,"" Zuckerman said of Democratic lawmakers, who control both the House and Senate.  The governor quickly retorted, talking over Zuckerman. ""Never a cut, never a cut, never a cut in the schools,"" Scott said.  ""Well, student-teacher ratios was going to be a cut, but they did not go along,"" Zuckerman said, before Scott cut in again.  ""We spend more money every single year for education,"" Scott said.  ""Well yes,"" Zuckerman said, ""just because funding goes up doesn’t mean there weren’t also cuts to teachers."" So who is right? Did the governor propose cuts at Vermont schools?  Asked about the claim, Zuckerman’s campaign pointed to a proposal the Scott administration dropped on lawmakers in the home stretch of the 2018 legislative session.  Scott’s finance commissioner, Adam Greshin, pitched the proposal in legislative committees in late April 2018. The statewide average student-to-staff ratio was just above 4-to-1 at the time. The Scott administration proposed reaching a ratio of 5.75-to-1 by 2025, entirely through attrition (not replacing some educators who retire or move on for other reasons).  ""We are trying to come up with ways to do this, but we haven’t fully vetted this,"" Greshin told lawmakers at the time. Under the administration’s proposal, districts that fall below targets set by the state would face fines as high as $20,000 to $40,000. The plan would have gone into effect in 2020, eliminating 1,000 school staff positions statewide over a five-year period and saving about $45 million.  There were about 18,000 school employees statewide at the time of the proposal. Under Scott’s plan, teachers would be targeted, while about 6,000 school workers would be exempted, including bus drivers, cafeteria workers, operations staff, special educators and pre-K teachers. Jason Maulucci, Scott’s campaign director, defended the governor’s statement in an email to VTDigger.  ""The governor said ‘never a cut’ because his proposal fully funded FY19 school budgets. The governor does not believe fully funding budgets should be considered a cut,"" Maulucci said.  ""The governor's proposal also would have pegged education spending in subsequent years to the rate of grand list growth, which was projected to increase by an average of 3.25 percent per year over the next five years. Growing education spending by 3.25 percent per year while keeping tax rates level — at least to the governor — does not constitute a cut,"" he said.  Maulucci added that the ""proposal to increase the student-to-staff ratio … relied exclusively on attrition and natural departures"" and that only one in every five positions that opened up would be eliminated. Although the proposal included a financial penalty, he added it ""did not require districts to lay off teachers and staff and it was not even a mandated ratio increase."" Zuckerman said earlier this month the method or timeline of the staffing reduction was irrelevant. ""I mean, from what it would be with the number of teachers teaching now, versus the number of teachers teaching in the future, that would be a cut,"" he said. ""Doing it through attrition is still a cut. It might be cutting more slowly.""  Asked for further evidence of Zuckerman’s claim, Colleen Jackson, his deputy campaign manager, sent an email with links to news stories and policy handouts from the Vermont-NEA featuring criticism of the Scott administration's staff-student ratio proposal and other belt-tightening proposals.  ""As you look at the statement from David in the debate, you are going to have a decision to make about how you define ‘cuts’ and whether you are going to include attempts to incur job losses, loss of revenue as compared to inflation, and how far schools’ resources are going to be able to go,"" Jackson wrote. ""Each of these is a cut to schools."" Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman told Gov. Phil Scott: ""They’ve pushed back against a number of your budgets, including when you were going to cut schools, when you were going to cut teachers and educators in our schools."" In 2018, Scott specifically proposed reducing the staffing in Vermont schools by 200 people a year for five years, which was consistent with his view that Vermont spends too much on public K-12 schools. The proposal was slammed by the Vermont-NEA and went nowhere in the Democratically controlled Legislature. But had Scott’s plan been enacted, some schools could have been penalized — as soon as this year — for failing to eliminate teaching positions.  Scott’s proposal also had the explicit intent of curbing school spending, though not through direct demands to cut local school budgets. But Zuckerman did not say budget cuts, or even spending cuts; he specifically said cuts to ""teachers and educators."" And that’s the explicit purpose of Scott’s proposal.  We rate this claim mostly true. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097201700>],/factchecks/2020/oct/08/david-zuckerman/did-scott-really-propose-cut-schools-zuckerman-cla/

Says Joe Biden’s website shows that he supports the Green New Deal, despite denials in debate
","Former Vice President Joe Biden is being challenged on social media over his muddled messaging on the Green New Deal during the first presidential debate.  A TikTok post plays a clip of the presidential debate in which Biden said he doesn’t support the Green New Deal. The video then shows a screenshot of Biden’s climate action plan, which calls the deal a ""crucial framework"" for acting on climate challenges. The TikTok user holds up a sign calling Biden a ""liar.""  Interrupted repeatedly by President Donald Trump, Biden struggled during the debate to explain where he stood on the Green New Deal.  ""The Green New Deal is not my plan,"" he said. Shortly after that, he said the Green New Deal would ""pay for itself as we move forward.""  When pressed by moderator Chris Wallace, Biden responded, ""No, I don’t support the Green New Deal."" Biden went on to say that he supports ""the Biden plan that I put forward … which is different."" In the Oct. 7 vice presidential debate, Biden’s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, was also pressed on the issue, with Vice President Mike Pence calling the Biden plan a ""$2 trillion version of the Green New Deal"" and noting that Harris cosponsored a Green New Deal resolution in the Senate. Harris advocated for the Green New Deal in 2019, when she was a presidential candidate. When moderator Susan Page asked specifically for the Biden-Harris campaign’s view on the Green New Deal, Harris didn’t give a direct answer, and she pivoted to discussing investments in clean-energy jobs.  Biden’s campaign didn’t return requests for comment. But essentially, Biden has claimed that he doesn’t ""support"" the Green New Deal as is. Rather, he has said, he used it as a framework to build his own plan.  So what makes Biden’s plan different? Let’s start by looking at the Green New Deal.  The Green New Deal was a 2019 House resolution sponsored by Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. On its own, it would not have changed any laws. Rather, it listed a variety of climate change and environmental justice goals — such as universal access to clean water, resiliencies against extreme weather, and pollution and carbon emission reductions ""as much as technologically feasible.""  It called on federal lawmakers to enact a 10-year ""national mobilization"" plan to achieve those goals, and said the world needs net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 to prevent severe impacts of climate change.  Biden’s climate plan echoes some of that language, but differs significantly in scope. For example, it also calls for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But it’s missing some of the environmental justice goals the Green New Deal included. While Biden may share these goals, his climate plan doesn’t specifically include calls for universal access to high-quality health care and affordable housing.  Biden’s climate action plan gives a nod to the Green New Deal as ""a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face."" According to his website, the plan borrows ""two basic truths"" from the Green New Deal: that the U.S. needs to be more ambitious, and that the environment and economy are connected.  The TikTok post claimed that text on Joe Biden’s campaign website proves that he supports the Green New Deal, despite his denials in the first presidential debate.  Biden’s plan shares some of the Green New Deal’s goals, and he has acknowledged that his plan was inspired by it. But his plan differs in scope. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1ACAC0>],/factchecks/2020/oct/08/tiktok-posts/says-joe-bidens-website-shows-he-supports-green-ne/

HUD secretary says a homeless person costs taxpayers $40,000 a year
","
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development upped its cool quotient when Secretary Shaun Donovan appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.

Donovan and Stewart exchanged small talk about growing up in New York City before turning to the topic of homelessness.

""The thing we finally figured out is that it’s actually, not only better for people, but cheaper to solve homelessness than it is to put a band-aid on it,"" Donovan said in the March 5, 2012, appearance. ""Because, at the end of the day, it costs, between shelters and emergency rooms and jails, it costs about $40,000 a year for a homeless person to be on the streets.""

Stewart then mentioned the costs of mental health services for homeless, who suffer a high rate of mental illness.

Here, we’re looking at whether Donovan presented an accurate dollar figure.

A word on ‘housing first’

By emphasizing the high cost of leaving homeless people on the street, Donovan is reflecting a movement among homeless advocates and governments toward a model called ""housing first.""

Pioneered in the 1990s in New York City, it puts street dwellers in publicly subsidized rooms of their own and connects them with drug treatment, job placement and psychiatric services with the goal of stabilizing their lives. Unlike many treatment programs, housing-first initiatives don’t require participants to get sober first.

""Housing first is a kind of ‘come as you are’ approach. We encourage folks to accept services, and as a result people change their behaviors,"" said Brenda Rosen, executive director of Common Ground, a housing-first homelessness program in New York City.

The approach succeeds and saves money, advocates say, because it targets the chronically homeless -- those who have been homeless for a year or more and commonly suffer from addiction or mental illness. That segment of the homeless population uses expensive public services at very high rates -- emergency rooms, police and fire, and courts.

2002 study

Donovan’s office pointed to a study by University of Pennsylvania researcher Dennis Culhane titled ""Public Service Reductions Associated with Placement of Homeless Persons with Severe Mental Illness in Supportive Housing.""

Culhane analyzed the costs of 4,679 mentally ill homeless people in New York City who were placed in supportive housing that also provided social services. Those costs were compared to data on people who relied on public shelters, public and private hospitals and correctional facilities.

Culhane found that ""persons placed in supportive housing experience marked reductions in shelter use, hospitalizations, length of stay per hospitalization and time incarcerated. Before placement, homeless people with severe mental illness used about $40,451 per person per year in services (1999 dollars). Placement was associated with a reduction in services use of $16,281 per housing unit per year.""

This study is a decade old (the dollar figures are 13 years old), and it examined a subgroup of homeless people -- those with severe mental disabilities -- who need more services and thus have a higher cost of care. Donovan’s statement didn’t make that distinction; he just said ‘a homeless person.’

What else?

Plenty of other studies have attempted to determine the cost of homelessness, although with different variables such as city, age, addiction history, employment history and childhood background.

For example, the Economic Roundtable in Los Angeles looked at the costs of homelessness there and reached similar conclusions.

The 2009 study ""Where We Sleep: The Costs of Housing and Homelessness in Los Angeles,"" which followed 10,193 homeless individuals, found that the typical public cost for services for residents in supportive housing was $605 a month. For the homeless the cost was $2,897.

The rate of $2,897 per month totals about $35,000 a year.

""This remarkable finding demonstrates that practical, tangible public benefits result from providing supportive housing for vulnerable homeless individuals,"" the researchers wrote.

For guidance on this story, we talked to Philip Mangano, the former homelessness policy czar under President George W. Bush. Mangano helped expand housing-first programs -- with federal dollars behind them -- into cities around the country.

As the programs became established, Mangano said he was able to compile data from 65 cities looking at all services affected by homelessness.

Hospitals, police and courts top the list. Chronically homeless people are regular visitors to emergency rooms, and each visit results in a hefty bill. They also frequently use mental health and addiction treatment services. They tend to rack up lots of arrests, leading to costly jail stays and use of court time.

""They randomly ricochet through very expensive services, Mangano said.

Mangano even looked at the impact on libraries, finding that many of them had to hire extra security to handle homeless loiterers.

Using data from the 65 cities -- of all different sizes and demographics -- the cost of keeping people on the street added up to between $35,000 and $150,000 per person per year, Mangano said.

Conversely, after the housing-first programs had been established, Mangano said, he looked at the cost of keeping formerly homeless people housed. That range: $13,000 to $25,000 per person per year.

""We learned that you could either sustain people in homelessness for $35,000 to $150,000 a year, or you could literally end their homelessness for $13,000 to $25,000 a year,"" he said.

Why does it work? Rosen said housing people eliminates risk factors related to sleeping on the street, such as exposure to harsh temperatures and unhealthy drug habits that go untreated.

Supportive housing, by contrast, provides a healthy environment.

""Not only do you have support services on site, we build beautiful buildings and beautiful apartments,"" she said. ""You bring somebody inside, and you help restore their dignity. The support services that we offer help folks decrease their reliance on drugs. If they have mental health issues, they see a psychiatrist. And oftentimes their behavior is changed.""

Our ruling

Donovan said it costs the public $40,000 for a homeless person to be on the streets because of the expenses of emergency room visits, jail time and hospital stays.

He drew that figure from a 10-year-old study that wasn’t looking at the general homeless population but at people with severe mental illness -- a group that uses more services. The study also focused on New York City, an expensive place to live. Though Stewart and Donovan had been talking about growing up in New York shortly before, it wasn't clear that Donovan was referring only to New York when he noted the costs of homelessness.

But based on what we learned about the housing-first approach to ending homelessness, Donovan’s underlying point, as well as the dollar figure he cited, hold up. Mangano told us it costs between $35,000 to $150,000 in public services for one year of someone living on the street. That puts Donovan’s figure at the low end of the range, and it’s an outdated figure that would surely be higher now. All that leads us to a ruling of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976B4DC0>],/factchecks/2012/mar/12/shaun-donovan/hud-secretary-says-homeless-person-costs-taxpayers/

Wisconsin GOP bill would repeal law ensuring pay equity for women, Dem lawmaker says
","
A bill awaiting action by Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker would take away the right of discriminated workers to sue employers in state court for compensatory and punitive damages.

The GOP-sponsored bill would reverse a right to sue granted in a 2009 law approved when Democrats controlled state government. It covers many types of discrimination, including age and race.

But in criticizing his Republican colleagues for approving the new bill, state Rep. Cory Mason, D-Racine, issued a news release on Feb. 23, 2012 that focused on women.

He said the bill would repeal a law that ensures ""that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job.""

There’s no debate that the bill would repeal the right to sue contained in the 2009 law.

But would it also affect working women the way Mason says?

To explore how employment discrimination cases work, we spoke with two employment law experts, Milwaukee lawyers Jeff Hynes, who represents workers, and Scott Beightol, who defends employers.

There are two routes to filing an employment discrimination complaint: the state Equal Rights Division and the federal Equal Opportunity Employment Commission.

If workers prove discrimination using the state system, an administrative law judge can ""make them whole"" by ordering the employer to pay back pay with interest, legal fees and job reinstatement, if there was a termination. If the discrimination is proved in the federal system, often a ""make whole"" settlement is reached through mediation.

In either system, discriminated workers can collect larger sums of money from an employer -- compensatory and punitive damages -- only by suing.

A federal lawsuit has long been an option, but suing employers in state court for compensatory and punitive damages only became possible with the 2009 law adopted by the Democrats. That law is new enough, and discrimination cases take long enough to process, that no such state lawsuits have yet been filed. Under the current law, if such lawsuits are brought in state court, workers could collect as much as $300,000 in damages, depending on the employer’s size. (The employer must have at least 15 employees.)

Supporters of the 2009 law said at the time it was needed to enforce laws that require men and women to be paid equally and to deter employers from committing discrimination. Opponents said the law creates an unnecessary burden on businesses when workers already had legal avenues to collect damages for suffering discrimination.

Fast-forward to the GOP bill, promoted as a pro-business measure, that Walker’s spokesman said the governor is reviewing.

Would it, as Mason claims, repeal a law that ensures ""that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job""?

Mason argues the law ensures equal pay for women because filing lawsuits is the major way of enforcing civil rights laws. The threat of being sued in state court makes employers less likely to discriminate against workers, which also helps ensure pay equity, he added.

But ensuring the right to sue in state court, as the law does, is not the same as ensuring pay equity.

Mason also said there is an indication the ""pay gap"" between men and women in Wisconsin has decreased since the 2009 law took effect. He cited a 2009 study and a 2010 study by the American Association of University Women, which advocates for equity for women and girls. Using median annual earnings for full-time workers, the studies found that Wisconsin women earned 75 percent of what men did in 2009, ranking the state 37th; and 78 percent in 2010, ranking the state 25th.

Mason acknowledged, however, that the studies aren’t proof that the law caused the decrease in the pay gap. More importantly, the studies were an overview of pay -- they didn’t examine pay for women and men who do the same job, which is what Mason’s claim addressed.

What about the experts?

Hynes said the 2009 law deters discrimination because it is easier and less expensive to bring a workplace discrimination suit in state court than in federal court. If the GOP bill becomes law, he said, it would be harder for discriminated workers to collect damages and therefore harder to enforce laws prohibiting unequal pay.

Beightol disagreed that the federal system is more onerous and argued that discriminated workers have the same remedies available through federal court that they do in state court. He also made the point that no lawsuits have been filed in state court since the 2009 law took effect.

Our rating

Mason said Wisconsin Assembly Republicans approved a bill to repeal a law that ensures ""that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job.""

The law does not ensure pay equity, but rather gives discriminated workers the right to sue in state court for compensatory and punitive damages. So, if the GOP-backed bill is signed into law, that right to sue would be lost.

But discriminated workers would still be able to seek back pay and other ""make whole"" payments through government agencies, and they could still sue for compensatory and punitive damages in federal court.

Mason’s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would leave a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280968734C0>],/factchecks/2012/mar/12/cory-mason/wisconsin-gop-bill-would-repeal-law-ensuring-pay-e/

Rush Holt claims a clear majority of Americans support plan to provide free prescription contraceptive coverage
","
U.S. Rep. Rush Holt says the federal mandate requiring most health care plans to offer free contraceptive coverage makes sense.

And he claims a majority of Americans agree with him.

Fierce debate on the issue erupted when guidelines issued by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department that required insurance plans to cover birth control as preventive services, without co-pays or deductibles, were made final without exemptions for some employers with religious affiliations. On Feb. 10, President Barack Obama announced a compromise: if a religious-affiliated employer objected to providing contraceptive coverage, the responsibility would fall on the insurance company.

In a Feb. 24 e-mail newsletter explaining his support for Obama’s decision, Holt (D- 12th Dist.) said: ""Nearly all American women, including women of faith, have used contraception sometimes, and a clear majority of Americans support removing the cost-sharing requirement for prescription contraceptive coverage.""

Our colleagues at PolitiFact national recently ruled on a claim that addressed the first half of Holt’s statement. A White House official said: ""Most women, including 98 percent of Catholic women, have used contraception."" That claim earned a Mostly True.

With the birth control plan still under fierce scrutiny, we questioned Holt’s other claim. Despite all the rancor, do Americans favor the plan?

Holt’s spokesman, Thomas Seay, pointed to a February health tracking poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation that found that 63 percent of respondents support the ""new federal requirement that private health insurance plans cover the cost of birth control"" and 33 percent oppose it. The margin of error was 3 percentage points.

But that’s just one poll of 1,519 adults. We found seven other surveys that asked respondents about their views on requiring health care plans to cover birth control. Five support Holt’s claim.

A CBS News/New York Times poll found an even larger majority of Americans -- 66 percent -- support the plan requiring private health insurance plans to cover the full cost of birth control. About a quarter of respondents opposed the plan, with a margin of error of 3 percentage points. When asked specifically about the same requirement for employers with religious affiliations, support decreased slightly, with 61 percent in favor and 31 percent opposed.

A recent Fox News poll found 61 percent of respondents supported ""requiring employer health plans to cover birth control for women"" and 34 percent opposed. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.

A survey by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling conducted on behalf of Planned Parenthood and a poll by the Public Religion Research Institute both found majorities in support of employers providing health care plans that would cover the cost of birth control.

Another poll conducted for NBC News and the Wall Street Journal found 53 percent of respondents favored the requirement and 33 percent opposed it, with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. That’s a majority, but one that could possibly be affected by the margin of error.

Two of the polls we reviewed found opposition to providing free birth control coverage.

A Quinnipiac University poll with a margin of error of 1.9 percentage points found a split of 47 percent in support of requiring private employers to offer free birth control coverage and 48 percent opposed.

A poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports -- widely considered Republican-leaning -- found 46 percent opposed the plan and 43 percent supported it. The survey had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.

Our ruling

Holt  said ""a clear majority of Americans support removing the cost-sharing requirement for prescription contraceptive coverage.""

We found eight polls that recently asked respondents whether they supported or opposed requiring health care plans to cover the cost of birth control.

In six of those surveys there was majority support, only one of which could be impacted by a margin of error. Two others polls showed more opposition than support. Still, Holt’s claim is backed by most of the polls we reviewed.

Overall, this claim is Mostly True.

McDonnell says 7 of 10 states with lowest unemployment rates have Republican governors
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell says nobody creates a better environment for jobs than Republican governors.

""Seven out of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates (have) Republican governors,"" McDonnell said at Politico’s Feb. 24 State Solutions Conference. ""So I’d just like to say, on an empirical basis, that approach that Republicans are using is working. And I’d certainly compare that to what Democratic governors are doing.""

McDonnell, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, made the claim during a debate with Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association.  He defined the Republican approach as keeping a lid on taxes, spending, regulations and unionization.

We wanted to see if GOP governors really do lead most states with the nation’s lowest  unemployment rates and, if they do, whether that means Republican chief executives are better at creating and protecting jobs than their Democratic colleagues.

Let’s start with some basic math: Twenty-nine governors are Republicans, 20 are Democrats and one is an Independent. So under the law of averages, about six of the top 10 states should be run by GOP governors.

Now, let’s turn to the unemployment rates. Tucker Martin, McDonnell’s director of communications, said his boss’s figures came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics listing of state unemployment rates in December 2011, the latest month for which statistics were available.

Of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates, North Dakota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Wyoming, Utah and Virginia have Republican governors. New Hampshire, Vermont and Minnesota have Democratic governors.  

We found that the Top 10 list includes three states where the GOP tenure has been fairly short. In Iowa, a Republican governor took office in January 2011 after 12 years of Democratic governorships. In Wyoming, a GOP governor took office in January 2011 after eight years of a Democratic governorship. Both states were  also on the list of 10 lowest unemployment rates in December 2010, when a Democrat was governor.

And in Virginia, McDonnell came to office in January 2010 after eight years of Democratic governors. Virginia had the nation’s 10th lowest unemployment rate in December 2009, its last full month under Gov. Tim Kaine. Virginia still ranks 10th today.

Conversely, we looked at the 10 states that had the worst unemployment rates in December 2011. Under McDonnell’s logic, there should be few Republicans and many Democrats in this tier.

Six states in the Bottom 10 have Republican governors: Michigan, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, and Nevada. Three have Democratic governors: Illinois, North Carolina and California. One state, Rhode Island, has an an independent governor.

Economists have told us time and again that governors have marginal effects on economies of their states.

Anne Alexander, an economist at the University of Wyoming, largely credited her state’s 5.6 percent unemployment rate to oil and natural gas exploration and tourists visiting Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Tetons. And because more than half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the federal or state government, she said there are many public jobs managing the land and wildlife.

""Generally speaking, as an economist, I tend to think that any particular executive has less influence over the state of the economy than we might like to give them credit for -- either for good or for bad,"" Alexander said.

North Dakota has the nation’s lowest unemployment rate, at 3.3 percent. Stan Herren, a economist at North Dakota State University, attributed the prosperity to a solid state economy based on energy exploration and agriculture. Politicians, he said, have provided some help by adopting supportive business policies.

""If you want to put a number on it, it (the economy) is probably 90 percent of it and 10 percent is the policies,"" he said.

Our ruling

McDonnell said Republican governors head seven out of 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates, providing proof that the GOP has a better record on jobs than Democrats.

He’s right on the numbers, but on shaky ground when he insists Republican stewardship has brought those results.

The fact that seven of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates are led by Republicans is hardly evidence that GOP governors trump Democrats in creating jobs. Three of those seven states, including Virginia, were also in the Top 10 when they were were headed by Democrats a year or two ago.

We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978891C0>],/factchecks/2012/mar/12/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-7-10-states-lowest-unemployment-rat/
"['Georgia', 'Jobs', 'Ted Jackson']","
Data mostly backs up job loss claim
","
With an overcrowded jail, a courthouse to protect and criminals to help catch, Fulton County Sheriff Ted Jackson says his deputies have enough to do and don’t need additional duties proposed by a state lawmaker.

The Democratic sheriff of Georgia’s highest-populated county recently fired off a letter to Sen. Don Balfour, a Gwinnett County Republican, objecting to Senate Bill 469, which would fine people and groups who conduct mass protests at someone’s home and cause a ruckus. Sheriff’s deputies would occasionally be involved in stopping these protests.

Here’s part of Jackson’s objection to the bill: ""The role of law enforcement shouldn’t be to police free speech but the intent of this bill seems to be just that. By targeting only protests dealing with labor disputes, you are putting police officers in the difficult position of silencing the voices of Georgians and, in the process, setting us up to face potential lawsuits that would ultimately be paid for by taxpayers.""

But this part of the letter, published in the Feb. 29 edition of Creative Loafing, made us interested.

""Finally, I believe this bill serves no useful purpose in fighting crime. Working daily throughout the communities of Fulton County gives me the opportunity to interact with varied segments of the population and see firsthand how citizens are suffering under the sluggish economy. Our state has an unemployment rate close to 10%, which is higher than the national average, while ranking last in job growth.""

We’ve fact-checked claims about Georgia’s high unemployment rate before. But PolitiFact Georgia wondered about the final passage of that paragraph: is Georgia last in job growth?  

Most economist measure job growth in a state by using U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from one period and comparing it against another period. PolitiFact Georgia decided to measure the most recent 12-month period.

In December 2011, the most recent month available when Jackson wrote his letter, an estimated 3,809,800 Georgians were employed. In December 2010, approximately 3,823,700 Georgians had jobs. That’s a decline of nearly 14,000 jobs during that time period.

Only four states had a decline during that time period: Alaska, Delaware, Georgia and Missouri. Georgia had the largest decline.

So far, so good for the accuracy of Sheriff Jackson’s claim.

The five states with the greatest increase were, in order, California, Texas, Florida, New York and Ohio.

Wait! Those states are also some of the highest-populated in the country. Is the number of job losses the only way we should be measuring this? Georgia has a higher population than the three other states with job losses. Maybe that’s why the Peach State had more job losses than any other state.

We decided to do some more math to look at the percentage of job growth or decline in each state. In Georgia, the decrease was 0.36 percent. Delaware, at 0.68 percent, and Alaska, at 0.52 percent had a greater decline.

The Atlanta-based Georgia Budget & Policy Institute recently put together a fact-sheet on how Georgia fares nationally in job growth. Like us, they measured the percentage change in job growth.

""That way, you are counting for the difference in sizes (of each state),"" said Alan Essig, the institute’s director.

Since the official end of the Great Recession (June 2009), Georgia ranked 49th out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. in job growth, the institute found. Only Missouri and Nevada had a larger percentage decline in job growth, they found. The institute also looked at the same time period we did and came up with the same numbers, concluding that Alaska and Delaware ranked lower in job growth.

Essig also told us that since December 2007, the only states with a greater percentage decline in job growth were Arizona, Florida and Nevada.

Jackson’s office presented us an Atlanta Business Chronicle article that found Georgia was second to last in job creation between July 2010 and July 2011, saved from being dead last by Indiana. The article focused on the decline in jobs, not the percentage change. The sheriff’s spokeswoman, Tracy Flanagan, also sent us a November 2011 report that showed Georgia had the largest percentage decline in employed workers in any state between June 2009 and September 2011, which was just over 2 percent.

Georgia does not look good here, any way you examine these numbers.

Georgia did have a larger decline in jobs than any other state over the most recent 12 months available. However, the percentage of that decline was not as great as two other states. Other research shows Georgia was close to last since 2007 and 2009. 

The sheriff’s claim that Georgia was ""last"" in job growth is on target, but needs a little clarification. We rate the claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971DC700>],/factchecks/2012/mar/12/ted-jackson/data-mostly-backs-job-loss-claim/

Gov. Scott Walker says 94 percent of Wisconsin employers think the state is heading in the right direction
","
Democrats behind a recall of Gov. Scott Walker consistently mock the lack of progress on his promise to spur 250,000 new jobs in four years.

In response, Walker emphasizes the falling unemployment rate and what he says is new optimism among business owners -- ""job creators"" in the current GOP parlance.

As part of his case that things are trending well, Walker almost invariably says private businesses are nearly unanimous in their good feelings about the Walker era.

""Looking ahead, we went from two years ago when 10 percent of our employers in the state thought we were heading in the right direction, to now, this year, 94 percent think we’re heading in the right direction – and a majority of them are going to grow their companies in 2012,"" Walker said in a Feb, 25, 2012 interview with Politico .

He made that claim, almost word for word, in his Jan. 25, 2012 ""state of the state"" speech, saying ""94 percent of our job creators believe Wisconsin is headed in the right direction.""

That 94 percent is a big number, especially when you consider there are some 160,000 business establishments in the state.

Is Walker right about such overwhelming support among state employers? And are more than half planning growth in 2012?

Asked for backup for the two-part claim, Walker pointed to a December 2011 online member survey by Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce of 281 chief executives. The powerful statewide trade organization backed Walker in 2010.

In the WMC survey, 94 percent of the respondents said they ""think things are going in the right direction"" in Wisconsin. (Even more gave Walker positive marks as governor, which WMC officials said made sense given the success Walker had in enacting business tax cuts, regulatory reform and limits on liability lawsuits over the fierce objections of Democrats.

By contrast, in a June 2010 WMC survey when Democrat Jim Doyle was governor, just 10 percent of respondents to the WMC survey said the state was on the right track.

On the second part of the claim, a slim majority of CEOs -- 52 percent -- said their companies will see growth in the first half of 2012.

That was down from a June 2011 WMC survey that found that 60 percent of CEO respondents predicted growth. When you reach back to the survey in Doyle’s last year, 55 percent saw growth ahead.

So, Walker is right on the numbers.

But what do they represent and how accurate are they?

The survey was made available online to 1,167 CEOs, and WMC got responses from 24 percent -- 281 executives.

That’s an acceptable response rate for such a survey, said David Wegge, a survey expert and political scientist at St. Norbert College.

But Wegge said it’s not valid, from this kind of survey, to make a generalization about what businesses statewide think, because we don’t know the view of those who didn’t choose to join the group.

It’s OK, he said, to draw conclusions about the WMC members’ views -- if the survey respondents are representative of WMC’s membership.

The other critical question: Is WMC’s membership representative of the state’s employers as a whole?

Let’s take a look.

We compared the survey pool to a breakdown of Wisconsin’s business establishments by sector, based on data from the state Department of Workforce Development.

The survey was heavy on manufacturers, followed by service providers -- pretty closely mirroring WMC’s membership, we found. But the survey respondents over-represented larger employers when compared with the group’s membership.

Meanwhile, the survey respondents don’t match up well with Wisconsin’s statewide business profile. While a majority of survey respondents were manufacturing executives, manufacturing establishments are just 6 percent of Wisconsin’s businesses.

WMC represents some small businesses, but half its 3,500 members have more than 50 employees.

A much larger trade group, the National Federation of Independent Business, has 12,000 members, most of whom have fewer than 20 workers, including many mom-and-pop shops.

NFIB has not surveyed its members. State director Bill Smith said the would expect his members would be as enthusiastic as WMC’s about the state’s direction, but there is no concrete evidence of that.

The Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, another trade group, conducts similar membership surveys. Bret Mayborne, research director for the association, said such polls are not scientifically rigorous but provide insight into trends over time.

Our rating

Walker says 94 percent of Wisconsin employers believe the state’s headed the right direction – and a majority of them say they are going to grow their companies in 2012.

The numbers are correct, but they come from a small survey by one trade group and amount to a sample that is not reflective of the overall makeup of businesses in the state. Walker, however, presents it without noting the critical limitations.

Congressman Steve Rothman claims the wealthiest Americans pay a lower tax rate “than they have in the last 80 years”
","
As U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman recently told workers at a small business in Bergen County, the middle-class must pick up the tab for wealthy Americans paying their lowest income tax rate in 80 years.

The congressman pointed to that reduced tax rate during a campaign video posted Feb. 13 on YouTube, where he is seen talking to employees of Lanzo Plumbing in Hackensack.

""If these guys and gals making over a million dollars a year...won’t pay their fair share because the Republicans are protecting them, that means working people and the middle-class and seniors have to pick up the tab for them. It’s crazy,"" Rothman (D-9th Dist.) said. ""They're paying a less rate of tax -- these richest people in America -- than they have in the last 80 years.""

As PolitiFact New Jersey found, Rothman’s claim is off, but not by much.

The federal income tax rate for the top income bracket stood at 35 percent in 2011, marking a lower statutory rate than during most of the last eight decades. But for five tax years -- 1988 to 1992 -- the top rates were lower than they are today, according to data from the Internal Revenue Service.

Now, let’s trace the evolution of the top income tax rate.

In 1931, the top rate was 25 percent on taxable income greater than $100,000. The following year, the top rate increased to 63 percent on income above $1 million, and then grew in 1936 to 79 percent on income greater than $5 million.

The top rate remained at 70 percent or greater through 1980 -- and exceeded 90 percent during World War II and from the early 1950s to the early 1960s.

By 1988, the top rate fell to 28 percent and stayed there through 1990. For 1991 and 1992, the top rate rose to 31 percent, and then increased to 39.6 percent for tax years 1993 to 2000. In 2003, the top rate reached its current level of 35 percent.

So, for most of the last 80 years, the top statutory rate has been higher than it is today, with the exception of tax years 1988 to 1992.

Since various tax deductions can reduce an overall tax bill, we also looked at actual taxes paid as a percentage of one’s income.

According to a June 2010 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the top 1 percent of households, on average, paid 19 percent of their income in federal income taxes in 2007. That figure was lower than amounts paid in 25 of the 28 years between 1979 and 2006, according to the budget office.

It’s worth noting that as a group, the top 1 percent were covering a larger share of federal income taxes in 2007 than they did in 1979.

Still, based on taxes paid as a percentage of income, Rothman’s claim is mostly on target.

Paul Swibinski, a consultant to Rothman’s campaign, told us the congressman’s statement was ""‘close enough.’"" But he argued that Rothman was ""speaking off the cuff"" and said scoring him as ""‘partially truthful’"" would send the wrong message.

""Steve was being completely genuine and completely honest,"" Swibinski said in an e-mail. ""Do we want our politicians to parse every single word they say -- just go around repeating the same words over and over because it's ‘safe’ ??? That would seem to me to contradict the purpose of Politifact.""

Our ruling

In a YouTube video, Rothman claimed the wealthiest Americans are paying a lower tax rate ""than they have in the last 80 years.""

We looked at two measures -- the top statutory income tax rates and taxes paid as a percentage of one’s income. In both cases, Rothman’s statement is slightly off, but his overall point about current income tax rates is solid.

The top statutory rate is lower now than during most of the last eight decades, and the top 1 percent of households were paying a smaller percentage of their income in federal income taxes as of 2007 than in nearly all of the previous 28 years.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says Texas has regained all the jobs it lost during recession while the nation has regained 36 percent
","
Looking forward, Dallas Morning News reporter Gromer Jeffers Jr. asked Perry in a February 2012 interview what his priority is for the 2013 Texas legislative session. 
Perry, appearing on WFAA-TV in Dallas, opened his reply by touching on one of his favorite topics: jobs. Noting that Texas is a growing state, Perry said: ""We’ve got a lot going on. We’re creating a huge amount of jobs. A hundred percent of all the jobs lost during the recession have been reclaimed in Texas, have been re-created if you will, while the nation is at about 36 percent."" 
People are moving to Texas for those jobs, Perry said, which creates challenges for energy, for water and for education — issues that Perry said would top his legislative priorities. 
During Perry’s two most recent campaigns — his 2010 re-election effort and his bid to be the 2012 Republican presidential nominee — he repeatedly touted job gains in Texas, often saying that the state’s performance, compared to the rest of the nation, showed that Texas economic policies should serve as a model for the country. 
We fact-checked a lot of Perry’s job-related claims, in many cases finding them Half True because even when his cited statistics were accurate, his explicit or implied claim of credit was not supported. Job gains or losses in individual states are driven by many factors, with neither gains or losses fairly attributable to an individual officeholder. 
In the WFAA-TV interview, though, Perry did not lay claim to credit for all the jobs regained in Texas. So we’re focusing this fact-check on whether he accurately compared developments in Texas and the nation. That is, did Texas regain all jobs lost during the recession while the country recaptured just 36 percent? 
Perry’s calculation holds, as we’ll detail later in this look. 
But we paused first at whether Texas’ return to pre-downturn employment levels means everyone who lost a job has landed back on a payroll. 
No, said Cheryl Abbot, an economist with the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas. That’s because even though Texas has about the same number of jobs as it did before the downturn, it also has more people and a larger labor force. ""Yes, we have regained all the job slots … that we had prior to the recession,"" Abbot said. ""But as to who is filling those slots, we have no information. It could be new residents or Texans who got a job who had been unemployed."" 
John Heleman, the state’s chief revenue estimator, touched on this issue during a Feb. 21, 2012, hearing of the Texas House Appropriations Committee after noting that Texas ""had regained all the jobs it lost during the recessionary period"" while the United States had regained 36 percent. 
Still, Heleman said, the Texas unemployment rate was not falling ""as fast as one would hope"" and later noted that Texas is a growing state. ""Our labor force has grown,"" Heleman said. ""And in the years of the recession, we added people to our labor force that are currently not yet finding jobs. So, actually regaining all those jobs is a very good thing and a very positive thing, but we still have some ways to go."" 
Richard Fisher, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, made a similar point about the unemployment rate in a Feb. 15, 2012, speech praising the Texas economy and its jobs recovery. 
According to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state labor force was about 11.7 million in the summer of 2008, when the state’s total number of jobs started to drop. By January 2012, the labor force, meaning the number of people employed or looking for work, had surpassed 12.5 million. 
When Heleman spoke to the committee, he noted that the national unemployment rate had dropped to 8.5 percent in December 2011 from its recent recession high of 10 percent while the Texas rate had fallen to 7.8 percent from a high of 8.5 percent. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics has since revised the monthly Texas unemployment rates, putting the more recent high at 8.2 percent in December 2010 and the December 2011 figure at 7.4 percent.) 
Before the number of Texas jobs began to drop, the state’s unemployment rate was below 5 percent. 
So, population growth, perhaps helped along by the attractiveness of the Texas economy, helps explain that it’s unlikely that every Texan who lost a job in the recession has gained a new one. It’s true too, though, that Perry didn’t directly say everyone is back on a payroll. 
And what of the job figures behind Perry’s comparison? 
Unlike previous job statements we’ve checked in which Perry compared Texas’ performance to that of the 49 other states combined, here, he is contrasting the state’s record with that of the nation as a whole. 
To back up Perry’s claim, his spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, pointed us to a part of the Texas state comptroller’s website that tracks economic indicators for the state. It included this information: ""By December 2011, Texas employers replaced all 433,400 jobs shed during the recession as our economy rebounded more quickly than the U.S. as a whole and continues to add jobs. Nationally, through January 2012, only 36 percent of recession-hit jobs have been recovered."" 
R.J. DeSilva, a spokesman for Comptroller Susan Combs, sent us the details of how the Texas-U.S. comparison was worked up, calling it a ""peak-to-trough analysis"" that shows the pace of job recovery in Texas compared to the U.S. ""The analysis is done to show the negative effect on employment in Texas from the pre-recession peak number of jobs to its trough, and the number of jobs (that) have been added back since then. The same analysis is used for the U.S. employment peak through its trough."" 
DeSilva told us that the analysis was done using nonfarm employment figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Let’s start by looking at the national job figures. 
The country’s most recent recession began in December 2007 and lasted 18 months, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. U.S. employment was at its peak in January 2008, with 138 million jobs. From there, the number of jobs dropped for 25 straight months, long past the declared end of the national recession, June 2009. The number of U.S. jobs hit its trough of 129.2 million in February 2010. 
For its analysis, the comptroller’s office calculated the number of jobs that the nation lost as the difference between the peak and the trough, for a net loss of 8.8 million jobs. (See graphs at right.) 
Next, the comptroller’s office calculated the nation’s net jobs gained over the 23 months that followed the February 2010 employment trough. The bureau’s data show that in all but four of the intervening months through January 2012, the number of U.S. jobs rose. In January 2012, the most recent national jobs figure at the time of the analysis, the United States had 3.2 million more jobs than it did in February 2010. 
Finally, the comptroller’s office compared the 3.2 million net jobs gained since February 2010 with the 8.8 million net jobs lost before then, calculating what percentage of the number lost had been gained back. That’s 36 percent (3.2 million is 36 percent of 8.8 million). 
The office applied the same logic and methodology to Texas’ jobs numbers: calculating the number of jobs lost — on a net basis — between the state’s most recent employment peak and trough, and then comparing that figure with the number of net jobs gained since the trough. 
Texas’ job losses did not follow the same time line as the nation’s. The state’s total number of jobs didn’t start to consistently drop until summer 2008. Also, while it took the United States 25 months to reach its most recent jobs nadir, Texas hit its low point in 16 months, with the number of jobs falling from more than 10.6 million in August 2008 to about 10.2 million in December 2009. That’s a reduction of about 400,000 jobs (exact number: 433,400). 
Texas experienced month-to-month job gains in 20 of the 24 months after its trough. And in December 2011, the most recent jobs figure available for Texas from the BLS, the state had 440,200 more jobs than it did in December 2009. 
So, Texas added more jobs after hitting its employment low than it lost in the 16 previous months. And its December 2011 total of nearly 10.7 million jobs returned the state to its pre-downturn level of employment. 
One note on Perry’s wording: He said his comparison was of jobs lost ""during the recession,"" but the analysis on which his statement is based wraps in job losses that occurred — nationally and in Texas — beyond the recession’s end in June 2009. Still, we see that his point was to contrast how far the state and the nation have come in terms of recovering jobs that were lost during the economic downturn, and his backup, the comptroller’s analysis, does that. 
Our ruling 
As Perry indicated, Texas has as many jobs as it had before the recession — more, in fact — while the nation as a whole has not climbed as far back. Still, the Texas unemployment rate, though falling, remains higher than its pre-recession level, and, of course, not every Texan who lost a job has regained one.

Former Cranston Mayor Stephen Laffey says giant companies such as Toyota won’t locate in states that don’t have right-to-work laws
","
Stephen Laffey, the former Cranston mayor and unsuccessful Republican U.S. Senate candidate, was in Rhode Island recently to promote his new film, ""Fixing America.""

The movie is a documentary about Laffey’s travels through 18 states, where he asked a question that is the film’s premise: ""What if regular Americans were asked for their ideas on how to fix America's problems?""

Laffey, who now lives on a ranch in Fort Collins, Colo., made several appearances on local radio programs to tout the film. On WPRO’s ""Morning News"" show, he talked about one possible fix: passing right-to-work laws, which allow workers in union jobs to opt out of union membership and paying dues.

Giant companies like Toyota, he said, would not locate in states without right-to-work laws.

Some Rhode Island Republicans have been pushing for a right-to-work law in Rhode Island, arguing that it would help make the state more business friendly and attract new jobs. In January, we checked a claim from Republican state Sen. Nicholas Kettle, who said right-to-work states don't have budget deficits, ruling it Mostly False.

Certainly, Toyota has a giant impact on the U.S. economy. The Japanese auto manufacturer has been doing business in the United States since 1957 and assembling cars here for 25 years. With 10 U.S. manufacturing facilities, Toyota directly employs 29,089 people and has a direct investment of $17.9 billion in the country, according to the company’s 2011 U.S. operations brochure.

So we wondered: Was Laffey was on target on his very specific assertion that the company would not locate in states without right-to-work laws?

We quickly got our answer when we checked Toyota’s website and saw that it did, indeed, have plants in states without right-to-work laws.

Then, we called Toyota and asked spokesman Ed Lewis if Toyota refuses to locate in states that lack right-to-work laws. ""No,"" he said.

Lewis confirmed that Toyota has two manufacturing plants in Missouri, plus one each in West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and California.

How many of those plants are in right-to-work states?

According to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, there are 23 right-to-work states. Five of the Toyota plants are in one of those states (Tennessee, Indiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas) while the five others are in non-right-to-work states (two in Missouri and one each in West Virginia, Kentucky and California).

Lewis said the most significant factors in locating a plant include easy access to highways and railways, access to supplier networks and tax incentive packages. The location of the existing Toyota plants shows that right-to-work laws is not among the most significant factors in locating a plant, he said.

Kentucky, the state with Toyota’s largest direct employment and investment, is not a right-to-work state. California, the state with Toyota’s second-largest direct employment figures, is also not a right-to-work state.

The state with Toyota's second largest direct investment, Indiana, became a right-to-work state on Feb. 1 -- more than 15 years after Toyota located there. It is the first state in more than a decade to enact right-to-work legislation and the only one in the Midwestern manufacturing belt to have such a law.

When we asked him what he based his statement on, Laffey responded in an e-mail, ""The right to work vs. not right to work issue sure is a major consideration of any manufacturing company that is looking to locate a plant in the United States. Let’s take a look!""

Laffey included numerous links to stories touting the advantages of right-to-work states to manufacturers. And he attached a spreadsheet he’d created, using U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data, that shows a state-by-state comparison of the growth in real gross domestic product for manufacturing between 2000 and 2010.

Laffey’s table showed an 18.63-percent increase in right-to-work states compared with an 8.28-percent increase in other states. ""It would seem to be better, all else [being equal], and it never is, to be a right to work state instead of not -- if you would like jobs for the people,"" he wrote.

But that’s a broader public policy question. Turning to the more narrow question about his statement on WPRO, Laffey said, ""If I overstated the case in my hours on the radio, I apologize. If it helps educate the people of Rhode Island about the necessity of taking action to improve the business climate, that would be a good step forward.""

Our ruling

Laffey said big companies such as Toyota don’t locate in states without right-to-work laws.

A quick web search showed that four of the nine states where Toyota has manufacturing plants do not have right-to-work laws. And a spokesman for Toyota said such laws are not a significant factor in the company’s deciding where to build plants.

We rule his statement False. 
Correction: The initial version of this item reported that we checked a claim from Republican state Sen. Nicholas Kettle on right-to-work states and ruled it False. The actual ruling on Kettle's claim was Mostly False.

"['States', 'Transportation', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott says PIP fraud costs $1 billion
","
Just about every time Gov. Rick Scott mentioned his goal to reform Florida’s no-fault insurance law this legislative session he includes something else: PIP fraud accounts for $1 billion.

He calls it a ""fraud tax"" on consumers. Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater, the Florida Chamber of Commerce, insurance groups and other advocates for change have also used the figure.

Scott repeats the $1 billion claim to reporters and interest groups and average Floridians.

""We are the No. 1 state for staged auto accidents where people fake an accident,"" Scott said. ""If we don't fix this — it's already $1 billion in fraud — it will go up 30 percent year after year after year.""

With a cost so central to the push for reform, we wondered where it came from -- and if it’s right.

Scott’s communications team pointed us a to presentation outlining the problems with PIP from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. Total payments of PIP benefits jumped 70 percent from 2008 to 2010. In 2008, it was $1.45 billion. In 2010, it was $2.45 billion.

Reform advocates see it this way: What else but fraud could explain an increase in PIP payouts when the number of drivers stayed constant and traffic accidents have declined over recent years?

""Ironically, the number of lawsuits also doubled in the last two years,"" wrote Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty in a January letter to the editor, ""which undermines the entire premise of the ‘no-fault’ legal system.""

Scott’s press office also pointed us to a December 2011 report from a working group written by the state’s insurance consumer advocate, Robin Westcott, who works for Atwater. This report uses slightly different numbers, based on what is called ""direct variable cost,"" to measure the burden on insurance companies.

The direct variable costs include direct incurred losses, money to defend and investigate suspicious claims, commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, and policyholder dividends. This measure does not include overhead expenses and investment income.

These costs increased from $1.8 billion in 2008 to $2.7 billion in 2010, creating the $910 million ""fraud tax.""

""There is no other cause attributable for this increase but that of fraud and abuse in the PIP system reflected as a $910,695(000) fraud tax on consumers,"" the report states.

The reports use different data, which may explain their differing measuring points. The Office of Insurance Regulation uses PIP data reported by insurers in early 2011. The CFO report uses numbers from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

We went outside the state and consulted the Insurance Information Institute.

By their calculations, Florida’s no-fault insurance law has cost insurers $1.3 billion from 2009 to 2011. The institute did not have a comparison for 2008-2010.

The group adjusted its estimate for the rising cost of health care by incorporating the medical component of the Consumer Price Index. We should note that the $1.3 billion estimate includes actual data through the second quarter of 2011, so part of it is an estimate.

So, if you ask the insurance industry and its self-reported data on PIP payouts, Scott’s right.

Some say it's not all fraud

Ask the other side of the bitter PIP reform fight and you’ll get a different perspective.

Opponents of insurers in the PIP fight -- mainly lawyers -- told us they questioned the methodology of both measurements of the $1 billion Scott mentions.

Florida Justice Institute officials pointed us to a college professor’s analysis of the Office of Insurance Regulation’s data. Florida State professor Lorilee Medders dinged the agency’s data for being voluntarily submitted by companies and unaudited by the Office of Insurance Regulation. 
Beyond that, though, lawyers say there could be other reasons besides fraud for the increased payouts.

A big one: the economy.

Russel Lazega, a personal injury attorney who represents hospitals and emergency rooms across the state, as well as a small insurance company, said he’s seeing more middle-class clients file PIP claims. Normally they might have eaten the cost of medical care and missed work for fear of increased premiums. These days, he said, they can’t afford to pay out-of-pocket for care and have to file claims.

""Now they don’t have a choice,"" said Lazega, a critic of the changes Scott supports.

Lazega added he represents St. Petersburg emergency rooms and hospitals trying to get trauma bills paid. ""I have a hard time wrapping my head around where they come up with a $1 billion number,"" he aid.

Kim Driggers, a Tallahassee attorney who represents chiropractors and works with the Florida Justice Association, called the notion of ""$1 billion in fraud"" an overreach.

""Just because more in benefits were paid in a year certainly does not mean every dollar spent was on a fraudulent claim,"" she said.

""It’s not like the CFO went out and said here’s $1 billion I was able to recover in fraudulent claims being filed,"" she said. ""That to me would be a fraud ... the ones that you put in jail, the ones that you prosecuted, because those are the crooks that were caught that were scheming the system.""

These lawyers acknowledge fraud is out there but agree the industry is overstating and oversimplifying with their cries of fraud.

""He (Scott) can show a correlation but that’s a hell of a long way from causation,"" said Bill Newton, a member of the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud's board of directors and executive director of the Florida Consumer Action Network. He has criticized Scott’s preferred reform for PIP as a gift to insurance companies.

Other voices

You won’t hear the $1 billion thrown around by PIP reform’s sponsor in the Senate, Joe Negron, a Republican from Stuart.

""I haven’t seen strong evidence to verify that,"" Negron said in an interview. ""People are mixing fraud and over-utilization. They mean different things to me.""

To Negron, a trial lawyer, fraud means billing someone for services you don’t receive. 
Over-utilization, though, means billing someone for services you received but did not need, such as visits to massage therapists and chiropractors.

Sen. Garrett Richter, R-Naples, also working on the PIP issue, said he leans with Scott: requiring insurers to pay for unnecessary services is fraud. 
""I think there’s a nexis,"" he said.

Robin Westcott, the insurance consumer advocate, said the $1 billion ""fraud tax"" total in her report could more accurately be described as a ""fraud and abuse tax,"" which was her intent.

Still, she said, ""something’s gotta be wrong about this.""

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners recently released unaudited 2011 data showing more escalation in PIP losses -- $1.4 billion since 2008.

Our ruling

Scott has industry data on his side when he uses the number $1 billion, but it’s not clear to us that all of that money is caused by fraud. 
Those opposed to PIP reform put forward interesting arguments that the economy might be driving some of the increase in payouts, to people who otherwise might have paid for care on their own if they could afford it. 
Nevertheless, most people following the issue agree that fraud is a factor of increased PIP payouts by insurers. The question is how much, and it’s not crystal-clear. We rate Scott’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C209600>],/factchecks/2012/mar/09/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-pip-fraud-1-billion/
"['Oregon', 'Transportation', 'Sam Adams']","
Are Portland's streets safer for walkers, bikers and drivers?
","
After a recent Oregonian article questioned the Portland Bureau of Transportation’s spending priorities, Mayor Sam Adams, who has overseen the department since 2005, wrote a commentary in The Oregonian in his defense. He maintained that while some of Portland’s roads might be pock marked, overall, the streets were safer.

""In 2005, as a new transportation commissioner, I decided it was more important to keep drivers alive than totally comfortable on side streets. Together with the Portland Bureau of Transportation, we prioritized road safety over smoothness, improving some of the most dangerous streets and intersections,"" he wrote. ""This strategy is paying off much better than we imagined.""

The next line really caught our attention: ""Traffic fatalities have fallen dramatically, even as population has risen. You are more likely to stay alive biking, walking and driving around Portland than you were before.""

We wondered if he was right, so we got to checking. 
Portland’s population has grown over the years. The U.S. Census shows an estimated 537,000 people living in the city back in 2006. The 2010 figure is more than 580,000. That’s more than an 8 percent increase.

The real question was whether road safety had really improved during Adams’ time as head of the Portland Bureau of Transportation.

Our first call was to the city's transportation department for figures on traffic fatalities and accidents. The first part was the easiest to come by.

Spokesman Dan Anderson sent us a graph that laid out the total number of traffic fatalities over the past decade. This includes bike, pedestrian, motorcycle and car fatalities.

The numbers bounced around a bit; 47 deaths in 2003 was the high point, while 20 in 2008 was the low. Generally, though, the trend line points downward.

During the time Adams has been in charge the figures have fluctuated. In 2007 there were 36 deaths, the next year 20, the year after 33. Again, the trend line ultimately points down, but it’s hardly an uninterrupted decline.

We asked the mayor’s office about these figures and received a two-page written statement from spokeswoman Amy Ruiz. She noted that ""the six years from 2005 through 2010 were notable for having five of the six lowest numbers of traffic fatalities recorded in a year since 1925.""

We checked, and they’re correct. But that trend started at least a decade before Adams took control of the bueau: The 16 years since 1995 had 12 of the lowest numbers of traffic fatalities recorded in the same period.

The overall decline during Adams’ time in charge was driven almost exclusively by a decrease in motorist fatalities. If you look at the categorized figures, motorist deaths have  fallen uniformly since 2005 from 19 that year to 7 in 2010. If you look at other categories, however, such as pedestrian, bicycle and motorcycle deaths, taken together the trend in those fatalities is upward.

You might be safer driving, but you’re certainly not safer walking.

That’s why we’d asked for the number of traffic crashes -- not just those that resulted in deaths.

Those figures didn’t offer much in the way of support for Adams’ statement either. In 2005, there were some 9,660 accidents. That number rose in 2006 to 9,885 and then fell during the next three years. But, in 2010, it popped up again, hitting 10,334. Overall, the trend line there seems to indicate hardly any change at all during Adams’ tenure.

We decided we needed a broader perspective on all of this, so we gave the state’s Department of Transportation a call. Spokeswoman Sally Ridenour knew just where to find the stats we were looking for.

Since 2005, the state seems to have seen the same general trend that Portland has. The number of traffic accidents jumped slightly in 2006, fell the next three years and then jumped again in 2010, with a total of 44,094 accidents.

If you back up and take a larger, longer term look at accidents, the trend is downward for both Portland and Oregon.

Unlike Portland’s up and down numbers, the number of deaths statewide -- and this, we should note, is not the same as the number of accidents resulting in a death -- has been on a completely uninterrupted decline since 2005.

Never satisfied, we wanted to get an even broader picture. So, we pulled up a report from the U.S. Department of Transportation. That report showed that nationally the number of traffic-related deaths has declined since 2005 as well.

Because we can’t get enough of Excel’s spreadsheets, we took this line of thought a little bit further. We calculated the number of deaths per thousand since 2005 in Portland and in the U.S. at large. While it’s true that, as a whole, Portland is safer than the average, it’s also true that the number of deaths per 1,000 people have dropped by about 26 percent both in Portland and nationally. That is to say that Portland is getting safer at about the same rate as the nation.

While we were looking through all this data, we found a 2011 article from The Oregonian, which outlines how the Pacific Northwest was leading the nation in this decline. ""Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana and Alaska -- the transportation department’s ""Pacific Northwest region"" -- saw the nation’s largest decrease. Deaths plummeted 12 percent to 1,215, federal officials said in a report (PDF).""

In fact, Oregon’s figure for 2010 is the lowest since 1944, according to the report.

Naturally, we were a little curious about why this might be happening. We talked to Troy Costales, who heads ODOT’s safety division. He says it comes down to five factors: better engineering on roads and in cars, law enforcement, emergency response and public education campaigns.

""In Oregon we've been on a steady decline ever since 1999,"" Costales said. ""We've been out in front.""

Ruiz said the fact that national and state trends were down didn’t necessarily undermine Adams’ assertions that his focus on safety had resulted in fewer fatalities. ""He does not say focusing on safety in Portland resulted in unique traffic safety improvements.""

That might be the case, but Adams directly links his spending decisions to safety trends. If those trends are happening elsewhere, it’s hard to say just how much of the decline Adams can take credit for.

In any case, Adam’s wrote that, despite population growth, fatalities are down ""dramatically.""

""You are more likely to stay alive biking, walking and driving around Portland than you were before"" he took over, he wrote.

"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'George Allen']","
George Allen says he cut $600 million in taxes as governor
","
Republican senate candidate George Allen says he has the will and experience to bring tax relief to Virginia families.

""When I was elected Governor, we had an audacious agenda that naysayers said couldn’t be enacted with a Democrat majority in the state legislature,"" Allen said in a Feb. 23 guest column for InsideNova.com. ""However, we worked across party lines and enacted historic reforms. Working together, we cut taxes by more than $600 million...""

We’ll stipulate that Allen, who was governor from 1994 to 1998, did convince a Democrat-controlled legislature to pass major reforms to welfare, criminal sentencing and juvenile justice. But his claim of cutting taxes by $600 million, which Allen first made in his farewell address to the General Assembly at the end of his term, has gone largely unexamined.

Until now.

We asked Dan Allen, a spokesman for the Allen campaign, for proof. He sent us a list of more than a dozen bills and budget changes that occurred on George Allen’s watch as governor. We scoured economic impact statements for those pieces of legislation and searched newspaper archives to find monetary values for each item.

Three of the biggest tax cuts were approved in 1994.

*A Social Security income tax deduction for self-employed Virginians valued at $162.1 million over six years, according to a 1997 estimate of the Finance Department. The measure was introduced by previous Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, a Democrat, in his farewell budget.

*A tax cut for senior citizens that the Finance Department valued at $215.7 million over six years.  The action was tied to a settlement after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Virginia policy of taxing the pensions of federal retirees but not of state government retirees. The high court ruled the groups had to be treated equally.

*A tax cut on the tangible assets of corporations worth $104.3 million over four years. The program was originally passed under Gov. Gerald L. Baliles in 1988 and slated to last for eight years. It was suspended for two years in 1992 under Wilder, who was battling a poor economy. Wilder, in his 1994 farewell budget, urged resuming the tax cut for the final four years and Allen, who came to office that January, agreed.

Those three cuts add up to $482.1 million.

In 1997, Allen signed a bill giving self-employed Virginians a break on unemployment insurance taxes that was worth $137 million over four years, according to the Finance Department document.   

The campaign also sent us a list of smaller tax cuts that passed when Allen was governor.  We found their value by researching impact statements that were prepared at the time by the Department of Planning and Budget. Here’s the list:

*Major Business Facility Jobs Tax Credit, 1994, worth $2.1 million over two years.
*Coal Employment Enhancement Credits, 1995, totaling $33.2 million over two years.
*Enterprise Zones, 1995, worth $2.8 million over two years.
*Film Production Tax Exemption, 1995, worth $571,000 in two years.
*Military Tax Relief, 1996, worth $600,000 in two years.
*Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit, 1996, totaling $1.25 million in two years.
*Space Flight and Space Launch Activities, 1997, worth $1.35 million annually.
*Worker Retraining Tax Credit, 1997, worth $2.1 million in one year.
*Virginia Coal Employment and Production Incentive Tax Credit, 1997, worth $13 million over two year.

The list from Allen also included the BPOL tax cut on the earnings of businesses. The local tax was estimated to generate $300 million annually. The legislation allowed varying tax reductions depending on the size cities and counties.

We were unable to find a value for the BPOL cut and the Allen campaign didn’t have one. Dan Allen did not include this reduction in his $600 million calculation. ""Localities had their own flexibility on this, so it would be hard to quantify,"" he said.

They also didn’t include tax cut proposals from George Allen’s farewell budget in 1998, which news reports valued at $350 million. The major one, approved by the General Assembly, was setting aside $260 million to phase in the first two years of a car tax cut promised by incoming Gov. Jim Gilmore, a Republican.

We should note that Allen also proposed a massive $2.1 billion package of tax cuts in 1995 that was opposed by the business community and defeated by Democrats in the General Assembly. And despite Allen’s tax cutting efforts, state spending rose at an average level for Virginia governors during Allen’s term.

Our ruling:

George Allen said more than $600 million in taxes were cut during his governorship.

We came up with $676.1 million in cuts, although we should point out that some of these reductions took place over six years. Allen, however, never qualified the time period for the tax cuts. And he arguably could have added other reductions to his list.

We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973883C0>],/factchecks/2012/mar/09/george-allen/george-allen-says-he-cut-600-million-taxes-governo/
"['New Jersey', 'Poverty', 'Workers', 'Wayne DeAngelo']","
Assemblyman says a single-parent earning current minimum wage falls below federal poverty line
","
As a tough economy stretches resources, a Democratic legislator said the lifeline for New Jersey families relying on a minimum wage job is thinning -- and soon it may snap.

Residents struggling to find work in the recession turned to lower-paying jobs to get by, but the situation hasn’t improved, Assemblyman Wayne DeAngelo, who represents parts of Mercer and Middlesex counties, said in a letter to the editor published Feb. 27 in The Times of Trenton.

""Since the economy is slow to grow, these jobs have become permanent, thereby cementing the reality that the minimum wage simply is not a sustainable salary for New Jerseyans,"" DeAngelo wrote. ""At the current New Jersey minimum wage, a full-time employee earns only $15,080. In comparison, the federal poverty level for a two-person household is $15,130. If we keep the minimum wage at the current level, then single-parent families earning the minimum wage at a full-time job will live in poverty in New Jersey. We can’t sit idly by while parents raising their children cannot financially support themselves or pay the bare minimum of daily expenses while earning the minimum wage.""

Is the state’s minimum wage too little to lift a single-parent family out of poverty, as DeAngelo suggests? PolitiFact New Jersey found the assemblyman is right.

A plan to raise the state’s minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $8.50 per hour, then adjust it annually based on any increase in the Consumer Price Index, is coursing its way through the state Legislature.

But currently, full-time workers with minimum-wage jobs earn roughly $15,080 annually in New Jersey before taxes if they work 40 hours a week, every week of the year.

The federal government releases two measures of poverty. The U.S. Census Bureau sets poverty thresholds using income before taxes, which are used primarily for statistical purposes such as estimating the number of Americans in poverty each year.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sets federal poverty guidelines that are used for more administrative reasons, such as determining eligibility for assistance programs. Agencies may apply different income measures -- before taxes or after taxes -- to the guidelines.

A spokesman for the Assembly Democrats said DeAngelo based his statement on the federal health department’s poverty measure. For a family of two, the measure tops off at $15,130. That’s $50 more than the gross income of an individual working full-time at a minimum wage job. For comparison, the Census Bureau’s poverty threshold is $15,504 for a two-person household with a parent and child.

As the size of a household grows, the poverty measure increases. For a family of four, the federal health department’s guideline is $23,050. The Census Bureau’s threshold, which changes depending on the number of children under 18 in the household, is $22,891 for a family of four, with one parent and three children.

There’s debate about the overall economic benefits of an increase in the minimum wage. We’re not wading into that argument in this Truth-O-Meter item.

But in the scenario DeAngelo highlights, the annual earnings for a full-time worker would increase to $17,680 if New Jersey increased its minimum wage to $8.50 per hour. That’s $2,550 more than the health department’s poverty guideline for a family of two, but still less than the guidelines for any other size household.

Our ruling

The assemblyman said: ""If we keep the minimum wage at the current level, then single-parent families earning the minimum wage at a full-time job will live in poverty in New Jersey. ""

A New Jersey resident working full-time at a job paying the state’s minimum wage of $7.25 per hour makes roughly $15,000 annually. For a family of two, the federal health department’s poverty guideline is $15,130.

We rate the claim True.

Congressman: Conservative group held ""prayer vigil"" against Girl Scout cookie sales
","
Mom and apple pie, move over. Nowadays, U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson is fighting for Brownies and Girl Scout cookies.

Johnson serves on the House Judiciary Committee, which held a hearing Feb. 28 on whether insurance companies should be required to cover contraception as parts of the health care overhaul go into effect.  

Johnson appeared with a box of Thin Mints and a passel of questions for Jeanne Monahan, an official with the socially conservative Family Research Council. She was testifying against the requirement.

""Your organization, ma'am, sponsored a ‘prayer in’ -- a prayer vigil -- to stop people from buying Girl Scout cookies because you allege Girl Scout cookies is affiliated with Planned Parenthood. Isn’t that correct?"" Johnson asked.

""Sir, I am not aware of any prayer vigil that my organization has organized for to stop people from buying Girl Scout cookies,"" Monahan replied.  

A prayer vigil against buying Girl Scout cookies? We had to find out more.

We contacted Johnson spokesman Andrew Phelan, who sent us links to stories from left-leaning websites about the Family Research Council. He also sent us a link to a posting on the FRC’s website that displayed the text of an email sent out by the organization’s Prayer Team.  

Every week, this email asks readers to say prayers on public policy issues. The FRC Prayer Team’s email Feb. 8 asked that they pray against the health care overhaul’s contraception coverage requirements, the U.S. military’s treatment of religion and Planned Parenthood.

It mentioned Girl Scout cookie sales.

""Girl Scouts, whose leadership has been collaborating with Planned Parenthood for years, have found out that their cookie sales are suffering. This is very sensitive for the Scouts,"" it said. ""The Scouts had better confess their errors and make a clean break while they can.""  

(This item does not address whether the Girl Scouts have been ""collaborating"" with Planned Parenthood.)

The email suggested a prayer:

""May Congress expose and defund Planned Parenthood and may private organizations refuse to submit to shakedowns by Planned Parenthood and others in the abortion advocacy industry. May the Pro-life Majority grow in America until abortion has been abolished."" 

This prayer does not target the Girl Scouts by name -- just ""private organizations."" But the email does single out the Scouts and mentions no other private organizations.

The Family Research Council’s leaders have repeatedly warned the group’s supporters that Girl Scout cookie profits go to an organization that they think is on the wrong side of the family values debate.

In op-eds ""Say no to Girl Scout Cookies"" and ""Planned Parenthood, Girl Scout cookie monster,"" Cathy Cleaver Ruse, a senior fellow with the Family Research Council, blasted the Scouts for what she described as working in partnership with Planned Parenthood and deciding to admit a transgendered boy into a Colorado troop.

FRC President Tony Perkins said that ""when they’re not partnering with Planned Parenthood, they’re promoting sexual diversity.""

But FRC spokesman J.P. Duffy told PolitiFact Georgia that the group has ""neither held nor called for a ‘prayer vigil’."" We found no evidence that one took place.

And the FRC knows how to call for a prayer vigil. Last year, it held one against Planned Parenthood and sex trafficking, which it said are connected. (We’re not going to address that claim in this item, either.)

Our ruling:

Johnson said the Family Research Council sponsored a ""prayer vigil"" to stop people from buying Girl Scout cookies because the group’s members think that Girl Scouts are affiliated with Planned Parenthood.

We can say that an op-ed on the FRC website asks consumers to say no to Do-Si-Dos.

It’s also fair to say that the FRC prayer team singled out the Girl Scouts in one of its prayers.

But the FRC did not call for an actual prayer vigil.

And while the FRC came close to asking people to pray that consumers stop buying Thin Mints, it stopped just shy of doing so.

We give Johnson a Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AF0280>],/factchecks/2012/mar/09/hank-johnson/congressman-conservative-group-prayed-against-girl/

Obama promised gas at $2.50 a gallon, says Florida GOP head Lenny Curry
","
Lenny Curry, head of the Republican Party of Florida, said President Barack Obama is going to have a hard time winning Florida, citing gas prices and federal spending as just two reasons.

""Obama’s going to come here and spend a lot of money, but President Obama's going to have to run on his record. He's going to have to run on what he promised,"" Curry said in an interview on Bay News 9’s  ""Political Connections"" on March 4, 2012.

""He promised gasoline I believe at $2.50. When he took office it was about $1.68. We know it's well above $2.50 now. He promised he would cut the deficit in half. We know what's happened there,"" Curry said.

Curry went on to praise Florida Gov. Rick Scott for job creation, saying that showed a clear contrast with the Obama administration.

Curry, a businessman from Jacksonville, became head of the state party in September 2011. He was the hand-picked successor of party chairman Dave Bitner, who died after a fight with Lou Gehrig's disease.

We wondered if Curry was accurate in describing Obama’s promises to voters, so we decided to check it out. Here at PolitiFact, we take a special interest in the campaign promises of elected officials. We collected Obama’s promises for our Obameter and Scott’s promises for the Scott-O-Meter.

We asked the Republican Party of Florida for evidence to back up Curry’s claims about Obama’s promises on gas prices, but we didn’t hear back.

Curry said that gas prices were at $1.68 when Obama took office, and on that point, he’s largely correct. The national city average for regular unleaded at the beginning of 2009 was $1.79, so that’s in the ballpark, considering flexibility for regional variations.

But what did Obama promise on gas prices? Here, we’ll look at whether Obama promised gasoline prices at $2.50 a gallon. (In a separate report, we’ll look at whether he promised to cut the deficit in half.)

Back in the summer of 2008, Obama said the federal government should immediately consider energy rebates and releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. For the long term, though, he had other ideas for energy policy, such as investing in renewable fuels and making cars more fuel efficient. (See all of Obama’s energy promises here.)

Obama has broken one significant gas-related promise: to enact a ""windfall profits"" tax on oil companies. In 2008, he said the new tax could pay for energy rebates to American families. We gave that a Promise Broken on our Obameter back in March 2011. Aides said the tax was not necessary after gas prices fell from their 2008 highs. We have yet to hear of any moves to revive the plan.

The closest we could find to a promise on gas prices were comments Obama made in Winston-Salem, N.C. in April 2008: ""I want to invest that money in clean, affordable, renewable energy sources like wind power, and solar power, and biofuels, so that we're not talking about high fuel prices next summer or the next summer after that or the summer after that.""

But that’s a far cry from pledging a particular price.

We did find one current candidate making such a pledge: Republican Newt Gingrich said he would keep gas prices at $2.50 or less if elected president.

""I've developed a program for American energy so no future president will ever bow to a Saudi king again and so every American can look forward to $2.50 a gallon gasoline,"" he said at a CNN debate.

Analysts, though, are dubious of the power of any president to affect short-term gas prices.

""What can you do to change the market in the short term? The answer is not much,"" said James Bartis of the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research group that provides independent policy analysis. ""It takes many years to open up a new oil field, to prepare and get production from a new oilfield. Generally, I would say a decade is the minimum.""

Obama recently mocked Republicans for promising lower gas prices in a speech in Miami. ""It’s the easiest thing in the world to make phony election-year promises about lower gas prices. What’s harder is to make a serious, sustained commitment to tackle a problem,"" he said.

Our ruling

Obama has discussed the need for the country to achieve energy independence through reduced consumption and more renewable energy sources. At times he connected those policies to lower gas prices for families. But he never promised a particular price point and certainly not $2.50 a gallon. We rate Curry’s statement False.

Here, we’ll look at whether Obama promised to cut the deficit in half. (In a separate report, we’ll look at whether he promised to keep gasoline prices at $2.50 a gallon.)

Our research revealed that Obama did in fact promise to cut the deficit in half. He made the promise not on the campaign trail, but soon after taking office, at a meeting organized by the White House and dubbed the ""Fiscal Responsiblity Summit."" (The Republican Party of Florida pointed us to this event when we asked them for evidence for Curry’s statement.)

Here’s what Obama said at the meeting on Feb. 23, 2009:

""Today I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office,"" Obama said. ""Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.""

The next day, Obama repeated the pledge, this time in an address to a joint session of Congress. ""Yesterday I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office,"" he said.

Is Obama keeping that promise? In a word, no.

In 2009, the year Obama took office, the annual deficit was $1.4 trillion. (Generally speaking, the deficit is the amount the government takes in minus what it spends.)

The deficit was a little smaller in 2010 and 2011, but only modestly so, at about $1.3 trillion for each year, according to numbers from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. For 2012, the budget is projected to be $1.1 trillion.

The White House’s budget projections show a deficit of $901 billion in 2013, also short of Obama’s goal, even if his policies are enacted by Congress, which is by no means certain.

Obama was specifically asked about the promise in an interview in February 2012 with Atlanta’s WAGA-TV. (His campaign pointed us to those comments when we asked for response.) He said he wasn’t able to keep the promise because the economic downturn was much more severe than was commonly understood in 2009.

""Well, we're not there because this recession turned out to be a lot deeper than any of us realized. Everybody who is out there back in 2009, if you look back at what their estimates were in terms of how many jobs had been lost, how bad the economy had contracted when I took office, everybody underestimated it. People thought that the economy contracted 3 percent. It turns out it contracted close to 9 percent. …

""So, the die had been cast, but a lot of us didn't understand at that point how bad it was going to get. That increases the deficit because less tax revenues come in, and it means that more people are getting unemployment insurance, we're helping states more so they don't lay off teachers, etc. The key, though, is we're setting ourselves on a path where we can get our debt under control.

""The most important thing we can do, though, to reduce our debt is to make sure that we continue growing this economy. We’ve seen some recent good news about unemployment numbers coming down, more jobs being created.  We’ve got to to maintain that momentum even as we make some tough choices in terms of government spending.""

Our ruling

Back in 2009, shortly after he was inaugurated, Obama did promise to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. He has not been able to keep that promise, however. Obama said recently the reason for that is the economic downturn was much worse than expected, which in turn drove down tax revenues and drove up spending on things like unemployment and aid to the states.

Curry, the head of the Republican Party of Florida, said that Obama ""promised he would cut the deficit in half. We know what's happened there."" He prefaced it with a simple statement that Obama would have to run on his record.

Mike DeWine says that 90 percent of Down syndrome pregnancies are aborted
","
Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine caused quite a ripple in the Republican presidential primary race when he dropped his endorsement of Mitt Romney and threw his support behind Rick Santorum.

Santorum’s holds some conservative views, especially when it comes to women’s reproductive rights. He opposes birth control and abortion.

Enter DeWine, who served with Santorum in the United States Senate and became a close friend. Now that he is backing him, DeWine found himself trying to calm the flames left behind by Santorum as he stomped through Ohio for the March 6 GOP primary.

DeWine appeared Feb. 20 on MSNBC’s ""The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell"" and was asked about Santorum’s assertion that amniocentesis, a prenatal screening test, directly leads to an increase in the number of abortions. Santorum had made the claim earlier that day on the campaign trail in Ohio.

Would DeWine advise Santorum to stop talking about amniocentesis, O’Donnell asked. DeWine responded he would not, adding that Santorum was correct.

""The fact is 90-percent of Down syndrome children were aborted in this country,"" DeWine responded. ""Maybe some people don’t think that is a problem. I’m shocked by it. I think it’s a sad commentary. And what he was simply saying is the government should not compel every insurance policy that is written to cover that.""

DeWine went on to share a personal story, saying that his wife declined prenatal testing during her eighth pregnancy when the doctor told her that if problems were detected with the fetus that abortion could be an option.

""My wife said, ‘no, I’m not going to do that,’ "" DeWine said.

DeWine’s 90-percent figure caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention.

His claim is similar to one made by state Rep. Richard Corcoran during a debate over six abortion bills in the Florida House of Representatives. Politifact Florida checked Corcoran’s statement in April 2011 and rated it True.

More recently, PolitiFact national rated a similar comment from Santorum. After finding some additional information about the data, Santorum’s claim got a rating of Half True. We’ve incorporated that data here.  

Corcoran cited a New York Times article from 2007 that discussed how effective prenatal testing to detect Down syndrome could reduce the number of children born with the genetic condition, and how parents of children with Down syndrome were trying to convince others not to abort fetuses that tested positive for the condition.

The story included almost the same line that Corcoran used — that ""about 90 percent of pregnant women who are given a Down syndrome diagnosis have chosen to have an abortion.""

The story linked to a 1999 study from the Psychology and Genetics Research Group at King’s College in London which discussed abortion rates after a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. It compiled results from 20 other studies measuring abortion rates and concluded that, following a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome, 92 percent of women chose to have an abortion.

Other studies showed similar percentages.

A study from Wayne State University in Michigan examined 145 pregnancies with a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome from 1988-97 and found that 19 (13.1 percent) women chose continuation of the pregnancy, while 126 (86.9 percent) chose termination. Another study examined 131 prenatally diagnosed cases of Down syndrome in Hawaii from 1987-96 and found that women in 110 of those cases (84 percent) chose to have their pregnancies terminated. A study in San Francisco published in 2006 found an overall rate of 81 percent.

That data was cited to rate Corcoran’s statement.

However, in additional research for the Santorum comment and for this article, PolitiFact found information that makes the question less cut-and-dried.
   
A joint statement from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other groups cautioned against generalizing about national patterns from a series of smaller, local studies.
       
""No current, comprehensive estimate of the number of pregnancy terminations following prenatal diagnosis exists,"" the statement said. ""Several studies reporting older data, studies from single centers and studies from other countries have reflected variation in the number of pregnancies terminated. These studies are frequently cited, but given their limitations, are difficult to generalize to the current population of pregnant women in the United States. Undocumented observations from prenatal genetic counselors in the United States suggest that the rate of termination for prenatally diagnosed Down syndrome may vary across the country. New research is called for to comprehensively explore the uptake of prenatal testing and the outcomes of prenatally diagnosed pregnancies in order to more accurately define how women currently incorporate prenatal testing into their lives.""
   
Mark I. Evans, a physician and president of the Fetal Medicine Foundation of America and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, emphasized that the percentage can vary significantly based on region and other factors.
   
""In liberal areas such as New York City, probably 80 to 90 percent of patients with severe abnormalties do choose to terminate when legal to do so,"" Evans said. ""In conservative areas, the proportion of terminations is much lower, perhaps as little as 10 percent"" in some cases.
   
The issue is addressed, too, in a paper in the journal Issues in Law & Medicine titled ""Informed Consent or Institutionalized Eugenics? How the Medical Profession Encourages Abortion of Fetuses with Down Syndrome."" The paper cites the example of a professor and practitioner, Elizabeth Gettig, who found that ""almost 100 percent"" of women with a Down syndrome diagnosis chose to abort when she practiced in North Carolina, but the number dropped to about half when she relocated to Pittsburgh. Gettig offered several reasons for the disparity.
   
""First, the Pittsburgh region has a higher percentage of Catholics,"" the paper said. ""Second, there are more services than most cities in Pittsburgh to assist children who have disabilities.""

There is an element of truth in DeWine’s claim. A number of studies have shown an abortion rate from 80 percent to 90 percent.

But all of those studies were localized. And we found experts who cautioned against applying that kind of research to the country as a whole, as DeWine did.

And DeWine’s comment was broader than Corcoran’s or Santorum’s and broader than what was encompassed in the studies.

Corcoran and Santorum specifically referred to cases in which there was a Down syndrome diagnosis. That also was the focus of the research.

In the interview, DeWine was asked about Santorum’s comments about pre-natal screenings and abortion. But his claim, that it’s a fact that ""90-percent of Down syndrome children were aborted in this country,"" made no such mention of screenings and a Down Syndrome diagnosis. His statement would also include, for example, Down syndrome children born to mothers who had no prenatal testing.

That’s a critical fact that would give a different impression of the accuracy of his claim.

On the Truth-O-Meter, DeWine’s statement rates Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C045C0>],/factchecks/2012/mar/08/mike-dewine/mike-dewine-says-90-percent-down-syndrome-pregnanc/
