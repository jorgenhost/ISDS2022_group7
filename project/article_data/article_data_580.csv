Bank bailouts not in bill, but liquidation is
","Sen. Mitch McConnell said that new financial regulations under consideration in the Senate could lead to only one thing: bailouts.""In fact, if you look at it carefully, it will lead to endless taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street banks,"" McConnell said at a press conference on April 14, adding that it ""actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks"" and that it sets up ""in perpetuity the potential for additional taxpayer bailouts of large institutions."" Those comments must have sounded like fighting words to President Barack Obama. He directly rebutted McConnell, the leader of the Senate Republicans, in his weekly address.McConnell has ""made the cynical and deceptive assertion that reform would somehow enable future bailouts – when he knows that it would do just the opposite,"" Obama said.The debate is critical because voters hate bailouts. In fact, Republican pollster Frank Luntz advised opponents of regulation that ""the single best way to kill any legislation is to link it to the Big Bank Bailout.""We wanted to check McConnell's claim that the new financial regulation ""actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks"" and that it would be at taxpayer expense.The financial regulations under consideration in the Senate do a number of things: The government receives additional authority to regulate over-the-counter derivatives and hedge funds. A new consumer protection agency within the Federal Reserve will regulate financial products. And the bill creates a process for federal authorities to dissolve financial institutions that are teetering on collapse.It's that last item that seems to be attracting McConnell's ire. He said the bill was ""taking that experience in the fall of 2008 and institutionalizing it, setting up in perpetuity the potential for additional taxpayer bailouts of large institutions."" The official name of that part of the bill is ""Orderly Resolution Authority."" It sets up a panel of three bankruptcy judges who convene and agree within 24 hours about whether a large financial company is insolvent. If a ""systematically significant"" firm is teetering on collapse, the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve would have to agree to liquidate the firm, using a special fund created with payments from the largest financial firms. The FDIC ""shall impose assessments on a graduated basis, with financial companies having greater assets being assessed at a higher rate,"" according to the legislation.We should clarify that there will be no change for small, mid-sized and even fairly large banks. When they're in trouble, there's already a well-established mechanism, under FDIC authority, that is not considered a bailout.Instead, the ""bailouts"" at issue are those for the small number of very large, highly interconnected institutions -- those sometimes called ""too big to fail"" because their collapse would severely impact the rest of the economy.The legislative language says that the money must be used to dissolve -- meaning completely shut down -- failing firms. Here's what Sec. 206 of the bill says:""In taking action under this title, the (FDIC) shall determine that such action is necessary for purposes of the financial stability of the United States, and not for the purpose of preserving the covered financial company; ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims and the Fund are fully paid; ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in accordance with the priority of claim provisions in section 210; ensure that management responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company is removed (if such management has not already been removed at the time at which the FDIC is appointed receiver); and not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary.""We spoke with several experts specifically about the fund in a previous report, where we fact-checked Republican Sen. Richard Shelby's statement that the fund is ""available for virtually any purpose that the treasury secretary sees fit."" The consensus of the experts was that the legislation put forward numerous rules on how the fund is to be used, with the express purpose of liquidating -- that is, shutting down -- failing firms. We rated Shelby's statement False. McConnell said that the bill ""actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks."" One of the sticking points here, of course, is the word bailout. We should acknowledge that free-market purists might see any intervention of the government into the financial sector as a ""bailout."" However, we think the more common understanding of the word means that the federal government gives or lends a company money to help it stay in business. Merriam-Webster, for example, defines a bailout as ""a rescue from financial distress."" We don't see how the liquidation of a company could constitute a ""rescue."" In fact, the bill pays for the so-called ""orderly liquidation"" by assessing a fine on the firms themselves, not general revenues, a situation somewhat similar to the way the FDIC has handled failing banks for many years now, using fees it collects from other banks to pay for orderly shutdowns. On the question of bailouts, we spoke to a variety of financial-services experts, and most (though not all) agreed that the bill would be a step in the right direction, in all likelihood reducing the risk of having the government having to undertake another bailout. That's the case in part because the bill aims to heighten regulation in advance so that problems don't emerge in the first place.Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican, helped draft the orderly liquidation measures in the bill, and he has been arguing against McConnell's assertions that the bill allows bailouts. He was asked about the bill on MSNBC's Morning Joe on April 20. ""Does it ensure future bailouts as Mitch McConnell suggests?"" asked host Joe Scarborough.""There are some loopholes in the bill, no question,"" Corker replied. ""But generally speaking, the central elements of the bill absolutely do the opposite."" Corker gave an extended speech on the floor of the Senate the day before, discussing many details of the bill, including the $50 billion fund.""This fund that has been set up is anything but a bailout,"" Corker said. ""It has been set up in essence to provide upfront funding by the industry so that when these companies are seized, there is money available to make payroll and to wind it down while the pieces are being sold off."" (By the way, Corker has asked both Democrats and Republicans to cool down some of their rhetoric on financial reform.)The experts we spoke with, however, said they believed a $50 billion fund might not be enough to wind down a large failing firm with a global reach.For a truly large and interconnected institution, several sources said, $50 billion probably won't be enough to do an ""orderly liquidation."" Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., a law professor at George Washington University, said that given past history, that figure is ""laughable"" and that ""$300 billion would be the minimum reasonable starting point."" We should add here that the bill is something of a moving target. There is speculation that the fund might be dropped from the bill, since it wasn't in the White House's original proposal. The Senate version will have to work out differences with the bill passed in the U.S. House of Representatives if it's to become law.In ruling on McConnell's statement, that financial reform ""actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks,"" we base our ruling primarily on the legislation. It clearly states that the intention is to liquidate failing companies, not bail them out. To do that, it creates a fund with contributions from financial firms, not from taxpayer funds. We do not see any element of the bill that expressly permits ongoing, ""endless"" outlays from the federal treasury. Is it possible that liquidation may cost the government money, potentially more money than is allowed for in the bill? Yes. But even so, McConnell is using seriously overheated rhetoric. Nothing in the bill ""guarantees"" future bailouts of Wall Street banks. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2010/apr/20/mitch-mcconnell/bank-bailouts-not-bill-liquidation/

Clinton says UAE only Middle East country to pass laws to address plight of immigrant workers
","In an April 18, 2010, interview on ABC's This Week, former President Bill Clinton spoke about how the unresolved Palestinian issue in the Middle East has been feeding the energy of terrorist organizations; and how a peace plan could lead to ""a whole different world."" Moreover, he said, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has deflected attention away from advances in the Arab world.""Dubai is the only country with huge amounts of imported workers that's actually passed legislation to give these immigrant workers a better deal in the Middle East,"" Clinton said. ""And they've got women in the government. They have a joint public-private decision making process. Nobody knows anything about it. Why? Because of the Palestinian-Israeli thing.""Human rights groups have long been highly critical of the treatment of immigrant workers in the United Arab Emirates -- where foreigners make up about 85 percent of the population -- and so we decided to check Clinton's claims about Dubai.First of all, as a point of clarification, Clinton erred when he referred to Dubai as a country. It is one of seven emirates and belongs to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is the country.But the real issue here is Clinton's claim that UAE is ""the only country with huge amounts of imported workers that's actually passed legislation to give these immigrant workers a better deal in the Middle East."" Known for its awe-inspiring achitecture, the world's first seven-star luxury hotel and world-class malls and sporting events, Dubai has established itself as an international tourist hot spot. But in 2006, Human Rights Watch issued a scathing 71-page report called ""Building Towers, Cheating Workers"" that detailed the exploitation of immigrant workers and ""the UAE federal government's failure to adequately address these abuses.""""Behind the glitter and luxury, the experiences of these migrant workers present a much less attractive picture -- of wage exploitation, indebtedness to unscrupulous recruiters, and working conditions that are hazardous to the point of being deadly,"" the report stated. ""UAE federal labor law offers a number of protections, but for migrant construction workers these are largely unenforced.""At least in part due to international pressure stemming from that report, the UAE released new draft labor laws in 2007 to help protect migrant workers. In August of that year, the New York Times reported that regulators in the UAE have ""enforced midday sun breaks, improved health benefits, upgraded living conditions and cracked down on employers brazen enough to stop paying workers at all."" And in April 2009, Gulf News (UAE) reported that the Ministry of Labour planned to introduce ""new rules for labor accommodation standards and a fresh mechanism to ensure payment of salaries, to protect workers' rights and improve their conditions.""So that's the legislation that Clinton was referring to.But despite those new laws, immigrant workers are still being widely mistreated, several human rights groups contend.""The passing of these laws in the UAE has not given workers a 'better deal,' "" stated Samer Muscati, Human Rights Watch researcher on the UAE and Iraq, in an e-mail interview with PolitiFact. ""Especially with the current economic downturn, we see that migrant workers are still the most vulnerable in that society. Despite the passage of laws, we see little enforcement. Under UAE law, and international law, passport confiscation by employers is illegal but the practice is still widespread. The same for recruitment fees, the reason for migrant worker indebtedness.""In January, Human Rights Watch issued another report saying the economic downturn had led to further deterioration of human rights for migrant workers. A news account of the report cited an official at the UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying the report ""has major drawbacks and fails to adequately record the positive steps taken by the UAE with regard to labor and human-trafficking issues, not just in 2009, but also in the last few years."" The UAE was ""not averse to admitting its failures"", the official added, ""but finds it unsettling when genuine efforts and constructive results find little or no recognition in reports such as the one released by the Human Rights Watch.""However, in addition to Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the U.S. Bureau of Democracy and Human Rights continue to highlight the plight of foreign workers in all of the Gulf states, including the UAE, said Christopher M. Davidson, an expert on the region at Durham University in England and author of Dubai: The Vulnerability of Success. In an e-mail interview with PolitiFact, Davidson called Clinton's statement ""heavy spin.""The day after Clinton made his statement on This Week, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navanethem Pillay, criticized the treatment of an estimated 12 million foreign workers in the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries (Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and the UAE).""Reports concerning this region consistently cite ongoing practices of unlawful confiscation of passports, withholding of wages and exploitation by unscrupulous recruitment agencies and employers,"" Pillay said. ""The situation of migrant domestic workers is of particular concern because their isolation in private homes makes them even more vulnerable to physical, psychological and sexual violence. They may also experience inadequate living and working conditions and violations of the right to health. Some are held in prolonged detention after they escape abusive employers, and may be unable to obtain access to judicial recourse and effective remedies for their plight.""Said Davidson: ""I would agree that despite some superficial legal protections that have been introduced in the UAE (and other Gulf states), these practices remain rampant.""Pillay did give a nod to the efforts of the UAE and several of the Persian Gulf countries for attempting to address some these problems with new or amended labor laws, and enhanced inspections. In an e-mail interview with PolitiFact, Jim Krane, author of City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism agreed that ""there have been some actions in Dubai to improve the lot of these 'imported workers' that make up most of the city's population. That said, their working and living conditions are still pretty bad and the legislation doesn't do anything about their appalling rates of pay.""Nicholas McGeehan, founder and director of Mafiwasta, an organization for migrant workers' rights in the United Arab Emirates, called Clinton's statement ""nonsense, pure and simple.""The new labor laws drafted by the UAE in 2007 were highly criticized at the time as essentially no different from the existing labor law which dated from 1980, McGeehan said; and no new legislation was ever implemented. ""The UAE does pass quasi-legal ministerial directives from time to time, largely in response to international criticism,"" McGeehan said. ""These are of dubious legal character and have no effect. For example, a law was passed to fine companies who were making workers work through the mid-summer heat in 2005. No firms were ever prosecuted.""""So to summarize,"" McGeehan said, ""no legislation has been passed to protect workers, the situation has actually gotten worse, in contrast to the government's PR-driven rhetoric, and the U.S.'s political and business interests in the region compromise its public statements on the issue.""Lastly, we draw your attention to the 2009 human rights report on the UAE issued on March 11, 2010, by the U.S. State Department (headed, of course, by Hillary Clinton). The report credits the UAE government making efforts to enhance protections for migrant workers. But overall, the report doesn't paint a pretty picture:• ""Some women from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and the Philippines migrated willingly to the country to work as domestic servants, but some faced debt bondage to recruiters; conditions of involuntary servitude, such as excessive work hours without pay; verbal, mental, physical, or sexual abuse; and restrictions on movement. Men from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Pakistan who came to the country to work in the construction industry occasionally were subject to involuntary servitude and debt bondage to pay recruitment costs. It was illegal but customary for employers to take custody of workers' passports.""• ""Some employment agents continued to bring numerous foreign workers to the country to work under forced or compulsory conditions, and there continued to be reports of worker suicides. Some women were brought to the country under false promises of legitimate employment and forced into prostitution. Low-paid unskilled and semi-skilled workers were also victims of contract switching, which occurred when a worker was offered a certain position but received a visa labor card for a different position."" • ""Foreign workers frequently did not receive their wages, sometimes for extended periods."" The report noted that the Ministry of Labor sought to alleviate the problem of unpaid wages by requiring companies to direct deposit laborers' salaries into a bank. The deadline to comply is this May (though as of August 2009, just 500,000 of the 4 million foreign workers were paid this way).• ""Despite efforts to improve housing facilities, some low-skilled and foreign employees continued to face substandard living conditions, including overcrowded apartments or lodging in unsafe and unhygienic 'labor camps,' which sometimes lacked electricity, potable water, and adequate cooking and bathing facilities. Construction of newer worker accommodations was ongoing.""Several human rights watchers also took issue with Bill Clinton pointing out that Dubai has women in the government. It's true, Davidson said, that the federal government of the UAE has four female ministers, all appointed, ""but most analysts concur that this was a UAE effort to pacify foreign observers."" Added Muscati: ""Having women in government is not indicative of women's rights. The UAE is not a democracy but a monarchy dominated by men.""Davidson pointed to Pillay's statement from the Gulf states this week: ""Discriminatory barriers continue to hamper women’s right to shape their own lives and choices, and fully participate in public life and be part of public debates that influence the direction of a nation.""But again, our focus is the claim Clinton made about immigrant workers, and that the UAE is the only Middle East country that has passed legislation to improve the lot of a large population of imported workers. The UAE government did pass labor laws designed to help protect immigrant workers. But they aren't the only Gulf country to do so. Bahrain, for example, took the lead in changing sponsorship laws. And human rights groups say that despite passing the laws, the UAE has not done enough to enforce them, and that exploitation of immigrant workers is still rampant in the UAE -- perhaps even more so now than before the laws due to the economic downtown. UAE officials say those reports ignore genuine efforts to improve conditions for immigrant workers. But even the U.S. State Department's report suggests the UAE has a long way to go on this issue.  In short, that's an awful lot of context left out by Clinton. He implies that the Israeli-Palenstinian conflict has crowded out some good news in the region. But the evidence suggests the news still isn't all that good. We rate his statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/apr/20/bill-clinton/clinton-says-uae-only-middle-east-country-to-pass-/

Gov. Rick Perry says mainstream media didn't cover April 2009 press conference on resolution for states' rights
","Texas Gov. Rick Perry, hailed by many conservatives who see Democrats in Washington as trampling on states' rights, told an interviewer for the Texas Tribune and Newsweek magazine last week that his public endorsement of a 2009 Texas House resolution on state sovereignty was not covered by mainstream news organizations.   Perry said: “We had a press conference here that interestingly no one in the mainstream media covered."" We wondered if Perry accurately recapped the April 9, 2009, news conference at which he endorsed a concurrent resolution authored by state Rep. Brandon Creighton stating the Legislature claims ""sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of the United States."" Perry’s office didn’t respond to our request for elaboration on the media presence at the press conference. Next, we found indications the news conference was covered by at least two media outlets -- the Austin American-Statesman and the Associated Press. Currently, more than 100 Texas newspapers and more than 150 Texas broadcast outlets are AP members and get its dispatches, according to Dale Leach, AP's Dallas bureau chief. Leach said the AP distributed five photos taken by a staff photographer who attended the press conference. The 246-word AP report on the press conference, sent out at 5:53 p.m. that day, quotes Perry saying: “I believe that our federal government has become oppressive. I believe it's become oppressive in its size, its intrusion into the lives of our citizens and its interference with the affairs of our state.” The article also states: “Answering a question from a news reporter, Perry suggested that (U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey) Hutchison,” then poised to challenge Perry in the 2010 GOP primary for governor, “is part of the federal government's expansion.” Our hunch: The mentioned reporter was Ken Herman, then a staff writer in the Austin American-Statesman’s Capitol bureau. Herman posted a blog and video from Perry’s press conference at 3:10 p.m. the same day; both remain online. According to the video, Perry took questions from Herman, who asked if Perry included Hutchison among active participants in expanding federal powers. Perry said she'd be among individuals in that category. Herman also asked if Perry could specify ways Hutchison had supported expansions in federal powers. “I’ll get you the long and distinguished list of those shortly,” Perry said. We found one Statesman news article that could explain why Perry says no one from the mainstream media covered the press conference. The article by Jason Embry of the Statesman’s Capitol staff -- published a week after the event -- states that Perry's remarks gave him a bounce in national attention even though the resolution itself “barely drew a mention in the print editions of the state’s daily newspapers” the day after the press conference. So, how does Perry’s recap stand up? The AP and the Statesman are clearly part of the mainstream media. We rate Perry's statement as False.",/factchecks/2010/apr/20/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-mainstream-media-didnt-cover-a/

Bill Clinton takes credit for ""flowering"" of economy in 1990s
","On the April 18, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, interim host Jake Tapper and former President Bill Clinton discussed whether Clinton sees similarities between his first two years as president and the first two years under President Barack Obama. Asked by Tapper, ""Politically does this year remind you of 1994?"" Clinton responded, ""A little bit. We passed the bill which reversed trickle-down economics by one vote. (It was) close like the health care bill (this year). And it led to an enormous flowering of the economy in America.""We thought it would be worth checking whether the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, as it was officially known, really did lead to ""an enormous flowering of the economy in America.""First, a recap of that bill.Its key provisions included raising the top effective tax rate to 39.6 percent; removal of the income cap on Medicare taxes; imposition of a 4.3 cent per gallon gasoline tax; and tax hikes on Social Security benefits and corporate income. As might be expected of a bill that raised taxes, the bill did not attract a single Republican vote in the House. So it was controversial at the time, and it still is. But love it or hate it, the bill has been widely credited with helping set the course for Clinton's economic policy. We see two related, but distinct, questions to answer. First, did the economy flower after passage of the bill? And if so, how much credit, if any, does the bill deserve for that ""flowering""? We'll take these questions in turn.Did the economy truly flower? Was there something in it for everybody? There's a strong case that in terms of employment, income and productivity it did.  We compared several key economic indicators during two periods. The first is the period between the bill's passage (in August 1993) and the end of Clinton's term in office (December 2000). The second is the period from the official start of the nation's economic expansion (in March 1991, during the presidency of George H.W. Bush) to the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (in August 1993). Our aim was to see whether the economic expansion that was already under way actually accelerated after passage of the bill, or whether it simply continued the existing expansion (or even if it slowed down).Here are some of the key indicators we looked at:• Gross domestic product. Between the third quarter of 1993 and the fourth quarter of 2000, the economy culumatively grew by just about one-third, or approximately 4.4 percent per year. By comparison, growth between the first quarter of 1991 and the third quarter of 1993 was just under 3 percent per year.So growth was strong in both periods, but it was stronger after passage of the bill.• Unemployment. Unemployment fell from 6.8 percent to 3.9 percent between passage of the bill and the end of Clinton's term, a period of seven and a half years. That continued a decrease that was already under way: Unemployment fell a full point between a peak of 7.8 percent in June 1992 and August 1993.So, once unemployment turned a corner, it fell noticeably during both periods. But the period after passage of the bill was especially impressive. During those 90 months, there was only a single occasion when unemployment rose for two consecutive months -- and even that was an exceedingly modest gain, rising from 4.3 percent to 4.4 percent and then 4.5 percent between April 1998 and June 1998.• Personal income. After the bill's passage, personal income increased by about 7.5 percent a year, compared to about 5.2 percent a year prior to passage. So income growth was strong in both periods, but it was stronger after the bill passed.• Industrial production. Industrial production followed a similar pattern. It rose by about 5.6 percent per year after passage, compared to 3.2 percent per year before passage.• House prices. The same goes for the real estate market. House prices rose about 4.7 percent a year after passage, compared to 2.4 percent per year prior to passage. (If you thought housing prices rose faster than 4.7 percent per year under Clinton, you may be mistaking his presidency for George W. Bush's; during the first seven years of the Bush administration, housing prices grew by almost 8 percent annually.)• The stock market. From the passage of the bill until the end of Clinton's term, the Dow Jones Industrial average rose from 3,651 to 10,788 -- a stunning 26.7 percent per year. That dwarfs the historically healthy increase of 10 percent a year for the two and a half years prior to passage.So, the statistics are unanimous: Not only was the Clinton presidency after the bill's passage a time of vigorous economic growth, but that growth was also demonstrably more robust than what occurred during the first two and a half years of the recovery.How much credit does the bill deserve for subsequent economic growth? Here are some reasons to be skeptical:• It's impossible to prove causation. There's a basic principle of logic: Just because you can prove that B happened after A doesn't mean that A caused B. That applies here.Was this particular bill what drove the economy to ""flower?"" Or did this period of unusually long growth owe something to the tax cuts -- proposed by Congressional Republicans and signed by Clinton -- that were passed in 1997? J.D. Foster, a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, argues that 1993 tax hikes ""probably slowed the economy compared to the growth it would have achieved"" and counters that the 1997 tax cuts were what kept the expansion chugging along after one would have expected it to wane.Meanwhile, Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the liberal Brookings Institution, credits not passage of the bill per se but rather a more intangible sense that Clinton economic policy would be less reliant on borrowing than that of its Republican predecessors. He said that between the beginning of 1993 and passage of the bill later that year, the interest rate on 10-year Treasury securities fell by more than a full percentage point. ""Many people, including me, think this was because financial markets began to take seriously the new administration’s determination to be fiscally conservative,"" Burtless said. ""People buying and selling stocks and bonds on Wall Street were evidently more impressed by the appearance of fiscal discipline than they were upset by the hike in top marginal rates.""This, Burtless argues, spurred business investment because it ""gave investors confidence that the drop in long-term interest rates was sustainable."" And this, in turn, ""helped boost industries producing business equipment, including high-tech firms and new and old companies that supply communications and computer equipment. Of course, lower long-term borrowing rates made it cheaper to buy a house and to obtain credit for household consumption.""For his part, Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, points to other Clinton-era changes that had a free-market bent.""The economy did do well under Clinton, but that was because of other policies he adopted and in spite of the '93 tax increase,"" Mitchell said, citing lower government spending as a share of gross domestic product, approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization, welfare reform, farm-subsidy reform. ""These are the policies that boosted the economy. The tax increases in 1993 hurt, but were more than offset by other changes.""• Clinton's economic policies may have also sowed the seeds of later economic decline. Nothing can take away the fact that Clinton presided over an extraordinarily long economic expansion. But some would argue that he also deserves some demerits for policies that led to less healthy economic developments.For instance, Dean Baker, a liberal economist, sees the stock market rise as a double-edged sword, leading to the bursting of the bubble in 2001 and perhaps helping shape a subsequent decade of only modest job growth. Baker also cited the Clinton administration's support for a strong dollar. ""The policy of promoting an overvalued dollar gave us the record trade deficits that eventually peaked at almost 6 percent of GDP in 2006,"" Baker said.Ultimately, few would deny that Clinton presided over impressive economic growth. Meanwhile, our number-crunching suggests that the economy's improvement did indeed accelerate after the 1993 Balanced Budget bill became law. Still, Clinton is exaggerating when he says the 1993 bill ""led to an enormous flowering of the economy in America"" because economists say many factors played a role. All in all, we give the former president a rating of Half True.",/factchecks/2010/apr/19/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-takes-credit-flowering-economy-1990s/

Gelber says Florida teacher salaries $5,000 lower than national average
","In the heated debate over the teacher pay bill that Gov. Charlie Crist vetoed, opponents of the bill often said that Florida teachers were underpaid. They warned that the bill -- which would have linked teacher pay increases to student performance -- would only make matters worse.Dan Gelber, a Democratic candidate for Florida attorney general and an opponent of the bill, wrote in a letter to Crist posted on his campaign blog that, ""the problem with the bill is it assumes the best way to weed out bad teachers is to assume all teachers are bad. While other states are addressing teaching tenure by simply modifying the number of years it takes to obtain tenure, Florida would take the drastic step of eliminating tenure and forcing teachers to work on year-to-year contracts. For a profession that, in our state, is already paid $5,000 below the national average, this will be demoralizing in the extreme.""We have no illusions that teachers enter the profession in hopes of becoming millionaires, but is the problem really as acute as Gelber makes it out to be?We contacted Gelber's campaign to ask about the source of his claim. A spokesman sent us a copy of the 2008 teacher compensation survey from the National Education Association, a teachers union. The report shows that in the 2007-2008 school year, the average teacher salary in Florida was slightly more than $5,000 below the national average.But we discovered the 2008-2009 numbers that Gelber's campaign provided are estimates that are now outdated. The most recent report shows that the actual national average in the 2008-2009 school year was $54,319, compared with $46,921 in Florida. That's a difference of more than $7,000. So Gelber could have used newer numbers that would better bolster his point that Florida teachers are underpaid.Besides the NEA, we found two other widely recognized data sets on teacher salaries. These come from the American Federation of Teachers, another  teachers union, and the National Center for Education Statistics, a federal agency. AFT's data is for the 2006-2007 school year. The average teacher salary was $51,009 in the U.S., and $47,219 in Florida, a difference of about $3,800. The federal agency's data only looked at seven states, so it doesn't provide a full national picture for comparison.We should note some caveats about making state comparisons of teacher salaries. The Florida Department of Education notes that surveys may not account for cost-of-living differences and factors such as states with higher percentages of teachers with masters' degreees. We also spoke with Elena Silva, a senior policy analyst at Education Sector, an independent education policy think tank. Silva told us that ""more important than comparing salaries to national average is considering total compensation (such as benefits and pensions) and cost of living."" Unfortunately this data is hard to come by, which makes meaningful comparisons difficult.Still, Gelber said ""paid,"" which to most people means just salary and there's enough for us to assess his claim that Florida teachers are paid $5,000 below the national average. The most recent data from the National Education Association, the source he cited, show that his estimate was actually on the low side and that the disparity is greater that he claimed. But a survey from the American Federation of Teachers suggests the difference isn't as great as he claimed. Still, both surveys support his underlying point that Florida teachers lag behind the national average. So we find his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/apr/19/dan-gelber/gelber-says-florida-teacher-salaries-5000-lower-na/

Rep. John Carter says families with special needs children will pay $13 billion more in taxes under the new health care law
","
The White House and most congressional Democrats have touted the nation's new health care reform law for extending insurance to those who have historically struggled to get coverage. Meanwhile, an opponent, U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, says it will slap higher taxes on families with children who have special needs. 
""$13 billion tax increase on families with special needs thanks to Obamacare,"" Carter said in an April 12 Twitter message that links to the House Republican Conference blog, where a series of ""ObamaCare Flatlines"" posts started appearing shortly after President Barack Obama signed the health care legislation in March. Carter is the secretary of the conference, which consists of every Republican House member. U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam, from Illinois, also sent his Twitter followers the tax blast. 
""An estimated 30 million families use pre-tax dollars in flexible spending accounts (FSA) to pay for routine medical care and other vital child care services,"" the conference's April 9 post states, going on to note that those families include parents with special needs children who use their pre-tax FSA dollars to pay fees related to their child's education. 
""ObamaCare burdens these families with a huge tax increase,"" the post continues, because the law caps the money a person can put in their flexible spending account at $2,500 per year. 
A $13 billion tax increase on families with special-needs children? 
Creighton Welch, Carter's press secretary, pointed us to a March 20 report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) that estimates the flexible spending cap will generate $13 billion in revenue by 2019. The committee advises Congress on tax policy. 
Welch said the reference to ""30 million families"" using flexible spending accounts comes from the right-leaning Americans for Tax Reform, whose tax policy director, Ryan Ellis, told us the statistic came from the Employee Benefits Research Institute, a nonpartisan research center that collects and analyzes data on employee benefit plans. Yet the institute, which doesn't take positions on policy issues, told us it couldn't vouch for the number. An industry estimate from the companies that administer the programs for employers is about 30 million, according to a June article by Kaiser Health News, part of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which analyzes health policy. 
Some employers offer their employees the choice of signing up for flexible spending accounts. Those employees send a portion of their pay to an account that can be tapped for certain medical expenses. Employees bank the dollars tax-free, thus reducing their taxable income. The GOP conference cites several examples of medical expenses parents with a special child could pay for with their flexible spending account, including Braille books. 
Some other existing restrictions on the savings accounts: In most cases, employees have to save all medical receipts and submit them to an administrator. And they must spend the entire balance; if there's money left in the account at the end of a year, their employer keeps it. 
For that reason, beneficiaries tend to use the accounts for routine health expenses they know will come due, not emergencies. They're a reliable way to fund co-pays, dental care and special procedures that can be scheduled to match an account holder's accumulated contributions. People with more serious illnesses who have predictable costs also can benefit significantly. 
The new health care law includes a provision that will cap flexible spending accounts at $2,500 per year, starting in 2013. There currently isn't a federal cap, though the institute says some employers limit how much their employees can put in their accounts. Typical limits range from $2,000 to $5,000. 
The $13 billion reflects the additional income tax revenue the government expects to reap during the seven years from 2013 through 2019 due to some employees with flexible spending accounts incurring more taxable income. 
Experts we spoke with didn't quibble with that number. But some cast the provision as shrinking a tax break, not raising taxes, because technically it imposes no tax on people who use flexible spending accounts. Leaving aside the argument over whether shrinking a tax shelter is the same as a $13 billion tax increase, some people will probably wind up paying more taxes after 2013 when the flexible spending limit kicks in. 
But will they all be parents of children with special needs, as Carter's message states? 
Welch said the Republican conference doesn't know, but that ""many of the 30 million families that use FSAs have special needs children."" 
Perhaps, but we didn't find data backing up that claim. 
""When it comes to FSA, we know nothing about who uses them or why they use them,"" said Paul Fronstin, director of the Health Research and Education Program at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. ""There's been no research on it other than 20 percent of the population that's eligible (for flexible spending accounts) contributes to them,"" he said. The average annual contribution to a health care FSA is $1,400, he said — an amount that would not be affected by the new limit. 
Fronstin said there's no way of gauging how many special-needs families will be affected, but that they won't be the only Americans losing part of their tax shelter. 
Ellis, from Americans for Tax Reform, agreed there's no data on how many FSA accounts are held by special-needs parents. But he said they'll be particularly affected by a cap because they bear high costs relating to special-needs education. 
Ellis said he has a friend who uses his FSA to help pay his Down syndrome child's tuition at a special-needs' school in the District of Columbia. Ellis said his friend's employer caps his flexible spending account at $5,000. 
On the other hand, Rich Robison, executive director of the Federation for Children with Special Needs in Massachusetts, and the parent of two young adults with Down syndrome, pointed out that the Individuals with Disabilities and Education Act (IDEA) requires schools to pay for accommodations a child with special needs may need to obtain a ""free appropriate public education."" 
Henry Aaron, an economics scholar at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said he suspects ""only a tiny fraction"" of the estimated $13 billion tax revenue would come from families with special-needs' children. 
Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that Carter's claim ignores the health law's broader impact: the JCT and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office project that 32 million uninsured will have health insurance coverage by 2016. ""Some of those are families with people with special needs,"" he said. 
The upshot? 
Carter's statement that the health care law will smack a $13 billion tax increase entirely on families with children who have special needs defies common sense. At our inquiry, his office backed off the sweep of Carter's Twitter message and conceded they didn't have numbers confirming that special-needs' families would bear the brunt of the tax change. 
All in all, Carter makes a dramatic, unsupported charge. We rate his statement as Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/apr/19/john-carter/rep-john-carter-says-families-special-needs-childr/

Bill Clinton says he never had a filibuster-proof Senate
","In an interview with former President Bill Clinton on ABC's This Week on April 18, 2010, host Jake Tapper marveled at the fact that Clinton's first Supreme Court nominee Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- now one of the most liberal members of the court -- was confirmed in the Senate 96 to 3. In fact, Tapper noted, Sen. Orrin Hatch, a senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, credited Clinton with bringing him into the consultation process when Ginsburg was chosen. ""What advice would you give President Obama?"" Tapper asked. ""Because Republicans are saying he's not including them in this."" Clinton began by explaining that he faced a different political environment. ""Well, I think for one thing, I had to do a little more of that (reaching out to Republicans) because I never had a filibuster-proof Senate,"" Clinton said. ""And now there are 41 of them, although I think that a lot of those who come from more progressive states, the two Maine senators, the new senator from Massachusetts, a lot of them may think they already gave it the store on the health care deal or whatever they're doing on financial reform. I think it will be very difficult to just outright block a Supreme Court nominee that's otherwise qualified."" With the close votes on health care reform, we have all become a little more familiar with how important political ratios can be to the legislative process. And so we decided to do a little research into Clinton's claim that he never had a filibuster-proof Senate. A filibuster is an attempt by the minority party to try to block a vote on issue. It takes a three-fifths majority (60 out of 100 senators) to invoke cloture and overcome a filibuster. That's why Scott Brown's election to the Senate in Massachusetts was such an important victory for Republicans. It gave Republicans 41 votes, enough to at least threaten a filibuster. When Clinton came into office in 1993, Democrats held the majority in the Senate. But the ratio was not filibuster-proof. Senate records show Republicans held 43 seats when Clinton came into office, and they added another seat in June of that year with the election of Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. That was the Senate breakdown when Clinton nominated Ginsburg on June 14, 1993, when she was confirmed by a 96-3 vote. And it was the same ratio (56 Democrats to 44 Republicans) when Clinton nominated Stephen Breyer the following year (he was confirmed 87-9). That would be as close as Clinton would ever come to a filibuster-proof Senate. In fact, Republicans won a majority of seats in the Senate in the 1994 elections and retained control of both houses throughout the remainder of Clinton's presidency. The party split resurfaced later in the interview when Tapper asked Clinton a nearly identical question to one Tapper posed a week earlier to Clinton's wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who championed the health care reform bill in 1993 and 1994. Both were asked if they felt that because they had ""stormed the castle"" on health care back in 1993, they had paved the way for for Obama to succeed. Hillary Clinton said she did not feel that way, only that she was delighted it passed and that it was ""a long time coming."" Bill Clinton said he ""absolutely"" did feel that way. Clinton said his health plan ultimately failed because, ""We couldn't pass it without five or six Republicans. I had an obstacle President Obama didn't have. They had an absolute, clear filibuster number. That is, they had 45 Republican senators. They could have lost four and still defeated me."" We note that Democrats at the time were also more fractured on which health care plan to support. But Clinton is right that Republicans opposed his health care bill and clearly held enough seats to attempt a filibuster in the Senate. It never got to that. Still, that is one issue where Clinton had difficulty because he lacked a filibuster-proof majority (whereas Obama did have that advantage, at least for his first year).

In veto message, Crist compares passage of SB 6 to health care bill
","In remarks shortly after vetoing Senate Bill 6, Gov. Charlie Crist admonished Republicans for pushing through the controversial teacher tenure bill without allowing amendments or a full and open debate.""This thing was rushed through,"" Crist said during a news conference announcing his veto April 15, 2010. ""Quite frankly, it reminds me of what happened with the health care bill in Washington -- where members of my party criticized the Democrats for sort of jamming something down their throat. And then here about a month later after that happens, you know, the very same thing happens here in education. So it's the wrong process. It had laudable goals. It can be done right. And we have a duty to make sure it is done right.""Crist said the passage of SB 6 reminded him of how the health care bill played out in Washington. We decided to check whether or not his memory betrayed him.Republicans argued during the final weeks of the health care debate that President Barack Obama's reforms were being pushed without regard for the concerns of the American people, or without input from Republicans, while criticizing Democrats for using a parliamentary tactic called reconciliation to avoid a potential filibuster in the U.S. Senate. Republicans offered last-minute amendments to either attempt to slow approval down, or force Democrats to take votes against measures that could be used against them in upcoming elections. Democrats rejected all of the amendments, and Congress ultimately approved health care reform without the vote of one Republican.In Florida, some of the same arguments have been made by Democrats, the state's largest teachers union and Crist. They said Republicans quashed debate and blocked amendments to ram the bill through the Legislature without the vote of one Democrat.To best dissect the claim, we decided to analyze apples-to-apples comparisons between the two pieces of legislation, inlcuding the length of the process, opportunities for public comment, opportunities for input and the level of bipartisan support.The health care bill that passed Congress and was signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010, is actually a combination of different proposals passed by the House and Senate. The U.S. House of Representatives filed its original version of the health care bill, HR 3200, on July 14, 2009, and a second version, HR 3962, on Oct. 29, 2009. That bill passed 220-215 on Nov. 7. One Republican, Joseph Cao of Louisiana, voted with Democrats to approve the bill.Over in the Senate, a third incarnation of the health care bill, HR 3590, passed on Christmas Eve 2009 without a Republican vote.The two bills were eventually merged -- without any GOP support -- and signed into law by President Obama.The total process from bill filing to bill signing took more than eight months -- not necessarily quick.Compare that with the state teacher tenure bill.SB 6 was filed in the state Senate on March 1, 2010, and passed on March 24, by a vote of 21-17. All 13 Senate Democrats voted against the bill, along with four Republicans.The state House took up SB 6 on March 25 and passed it 15 days later by a vote of 64-55 (11 Republicans joined the state's 44 Democrats in opposition).Crist vetoed the bill on April 15, 2010. Total Democrats in support --- zero. Total time in the hopper -- 45 days. Opportunities for public commentPeople for and against SB 6 had four opportunities to directly address legislators. Public comment was allowed during Senate committee meetings March 10 and March 19, and two House committee meetings March 25 and April 19. The state teacher's union argued that the public hearings coincided with FCAT testing and then, spring break.Congress, meanwhile, held at least 100 town hall meetings across the country to discuss health care in the summer of 2009. The conservative Web site Newsmax published a list of the hearings scheduled as of Aug. 12, 2009. They counted more than 140 all together. President Obama and members of his administration also held town hall meetings to discuss health care reform. The White House held regional forums in five states in March and April 2009. Obama participated in a health care town hall in Wisconsin in June 2009, a tele-town hall with AARP in July and a forum in New Hampshire in August 2009. Then there were health care rallies in Ohio and Virginia in March 2010.Opportunities for input The federal health care bill included lengthy debate in both the House and Senate, with each chamber passing a bill incorporating that body's priorities.Concessions were made for U.S. Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., to ensure there would be no public funding of abortion.And though maybe not significant, Republican amendments were added to the bill. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions adopted 159 amendments offered by Republicans. Only two of them, however, were significant or controversial enough to merit roll call votes. One of those two affected the manufacture of biologics medication and another required members of Congress and congressional staff to enroll in the government-run option (which was ultimately scrapped).  Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, told PolitiFact that 132 of the 159 were for ""technical amendments"" and that it was a misnomer to call them proof of bipartisanship. In the House Energy and Commerce Committee, 16 Republican amendments were adopted. But Republicans said only one amendment was major, and none changed the core of the legislation.In the Education and Labor Committee, six of the 17 amendments offered by Republicans were adopted. Again, Republicans said the amendments were largely technical.White House spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said 170 GOP amendments were accepted into the final bill that passed.Conversely, the passage of SB 6 was orchestrated -- particularly by the Florida House -- to prevent alterations to the bill. Republicans in the House waited until the Senate passed SB 6 before filing identical bill language. (The Senate version included an amendment allowing principals to factor in advanced degrees in their performance reviews.) Florida House Speaker Larry Cretul said he hoped there would be no amendments to the House bill.The reason? If the House changed the bill, it would have to return to the Senate for a second vote.""We hope that there won't be any amendments,'' Cretul told the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald. ""What the Senate sent us was a pretty good work product.''A majority of Republicans in the House rejected 19 amendments before passing SB 6. The amendments would have required school districts to set salaries at or higher than the national average, allowed school districts to use years of service or advanced degrees as a factor in setting pay, and force members of the Florida Legislature to teach nine weeks in a public school before the teacher pay plan could become effective.Republicans said the bill wasn't perfect, but wanted Crist to sign it anyway. ""I understand it wasn't a perfect bill,"" said Rep. Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel. ""But I thought it laid a good foundation.""And Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, said: “This is not a perfect bill; there are things in this bill that will change. It is a framework for going forward.”State Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine, also suggested the Legislature could write a follow-up ""glitch bill,"" if Crist had particular problems with provisions of SB 6.Our rulingBack to Crist's original statement.In vetoing SB 6, he said the process in the Legislature was similiar to the one Republicans criticized Democrats for using in Washington to pass the health care bill. In particular, Crist said both bills were sort of ""jamming something down (people's) throat.""He's right that neither the federal health care bill or SB 6 passed with a single vote from the party out of power.But turns out there actually was more debate in Washington about the health care bill, than there was in Tallahassee about SB 6.Congress and the president held more than 100 town halls to discuss health care with voters while Florida legislators had four public hearings. And while the White House says 170 GOP amendments were included in the final health care bill, albeit largely technical in nature, Republicans in the Florida House blocked every amendment offered by Democrats when considering SB 6. State GOP leaders also orchestrated a plan to avoid having to send the bill back to the Senate for a second vote or even conference over different bills.SB 6 meets our definition of jamming a bill through, which is good for Crist. What's bad for him, however, is that the debate over the federal health care bill was actually more collegial.

Sen. Richard Shelby overlooks safeguards in financial regulation bill
","Now that the health care debate has come to a close, lawmakers are prepping their talking points for the next looming battle: financial institution reform.Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the top Republican on his chamber's Banking Committee, aired his grievances in a March 25, 2010, letter to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. The letter was largely prompted by Shelby's concern that in a recent speech Geithner mischaracterized the senator's support for financial regulation. Shelby also took the opportunity to point out several ways that he believes the legislation his committee recently approved is flawed. ""The bill reported out of committee sets up a $50 billion slush fund that, while intended for resolving failing firms, is available for virtually any purpose that the treasury secretary sees fit,"" Shelby wrote on March 25, 2010. ""Nonetheless, the mere existence of this fund will make it all too easy to choose bailout over bankruptcy. This can only reinforce the expectation that the government stands ready to intervene on behalf of large and politically connected financial institutions at the expense of Main Street and the American taxpayer. Therefore, the bill institutionalizes 'too big to fail.' ""We wondered whether Shelby is correct about a fund that can be used for whatever purpose the treasury secretary sees fit. First, the details of the bill. On March 22, 2010, the Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Sens. Christopher Dodd and Shelby, approved the overhaul by a party-line vote of 13-10. Highlights include new government authority to regulate over-the-counter derivatives and hedge funds, a new consumer financial product regulator within the Federal Reserve, and a process for dissolving institutions that are teetering on collapse. The ""Orderly Liquidation Fund"" is the technical term for the $50 billion pot of money Shelby is concerned about. Only the largest firms would be required to pay into the fund. If a ""systematically significant"" firm is teetering on collapse, the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve would have to agree to use the fund to liquidate the firm. A panel of three bankruptcy judges would have to convene and agree within 24 hours that the company is insolvent. The fund is not meant to replace the bankruptcy process, but rather to provide a sort of emergency mechanism for the government to deal with very large, economically significant institutions.So, the bill provides quite a bit of structure around how the government would decide which firms should be dissolved.Shelby is clearly correct on his first point that there is a $50 billion fund in the bill (we'll leave the debate over the definition of ""slush fund"" for another day) that's ""intended to resolve failing firms."" The second part of his claim is that the fund is available for ""virtually any purpose that the treasury secretary sees fit."" First -- because we like to split hairs -- we should note that, while the bill says that the fund will be established in the Treasury Department, it will be administered by the FDIC, an independent branch of government, not the Treasury Department. Whether the money can be used for anything the government wants is another matter. The legislative language is pretty clear that the money must be used to dissolve -- meaning completely shut down -- failing firms. Here's what Sec. 206 of the bill says:""In taking action under this title, the (FDIC) shall determine that such action is necessary for purposes of the financial stability of the United States, and not for the purpose of preserving the covered financial company; ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims and the Fund are fully paid; ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in accordance with the priority of claim provisions in section 210; ensure that management responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company is removed (if such management has not already been removed at the time at which the FDIC is appointed receiver); and not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary.""The fund cannot be used to keep faltering institutions alive. What about bonuses? ""It certainly cannot be used for bonuses or salaries going forward,"" said Dana Chasin, legislative and policy liaison for the Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of generally left-leaning groups in support of financial regulatory reform. By definition, the fund would be used to dissolve companies all together; management would be summarily forced out in the process. However, it is possible that ""costs associated with liquidation could involve claims'' for prior compensation agreements held by the company, which could involve bonuses, Chasin conceded. ""There are certain kinds of contracts that may or may not be repudiated,"" he said. James Gattuso, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, says he's concerned about how the money might be used, but the bigger issue may be limited standing for anyone to file a suit to prevent misuse of the fund.""A similar problem developed under the TARP legislation -– under which GM and Chrysler got funding although no serious analyst argued that they were 'financial institutions,' as required under TARP,"" Gattuso wrote to us in an e-mail. ""There simply was no judicial review of the action available, because no entity had the requisite standing. A similar problem could develop under this legislation.""David Zaring, a professor at the Wharton School of Business, said that the bill does seem to give the government some leeway in reinterpreting the fund in the future through the rulemaking process. ""Shelby may be concerned because the bill gives [the government] modest rulemaking authority on how it construes the fund and some opportunities to reinterpret it,"" he said. ""However, that rulemaking authority is limited. I don't see any sort of blank check in that."" So, when it comes to the fund, it's clear that it can only be used to cover costs associated with shutting down a firm altogether, not to keep a firm afloat. But several of the people we spoke with pointed out that the bill is a bit vague in some areas, at least in their view. And indeed, the bill provides some flexibility in how funds are used during liquidation. That said, it's an overstatement for Shelby to say that the fund ""is available for virtually any purpose that the treasury secretary sees fit."" We also take issue with Shelby's underlying point, that the fund somehow encourages firms to take a bailout rather than bankruptcy. In fact, the rules of the fund dictate that it not be used to maintain companies that are bad for our financial system, but rather to shut down those companies altogether, a process akin to bankruptcy. Shelby also implies that the fund comes at a cost to taxpayers, saying the fund ""can only reinforce the expectation that the government stands ready to intervene on behalf of large and politically connected financial institutions at the expense of Main Street and the American taxpayer."" But remember, the businesses would pay into the liquidation fund, not taxpayers. The bill is very specific about that. So his underlying point here is incorrect. Shelby is right that the bill would create a $50 billion fund to help dismantle very large, faltering firms. While there may be just a bit of wiggle room on what costs the fund covers, the bill makes it clear that the money must be used to liquidate -- not keep alive -- failing firms. Also, the program is administered by the FDIC, and before it can step in to dismantle a firm, FDIC must have agreement of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and three bankruptcy judges. So, to say that the fund ""is available for virtually any purpose that the Treasury Secretary sees fit,"" is more than a stretch.  We find Shelby's claim to be False.",/factchecks/2010/apr/16/richard-shelby/sen-richard-shelby-overlooks-safeguards-financial-/

Cohen claims there are more tax cuts this year than almost any other in history
","With all the April 15 tax protests around the country and a recent CBS poll finding that 77 percent of the public believes the Obama administration has either increased taxes for most Americans, or kept them the same, an Associated Press quote from Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., piqued our interest.""The fact is, in the past year we have had more tax cuts than almost any time in our nation's history,"" Cohen said in the April 15, 2010, tax story. ""It's something that people don't realize because of the false rhetoric that is spread throughout this Congress.""The comment is based on tax cuts included in the economic stimulus bill pushed through Congress by Democrats early last year. The one with the widest reach was the Making Work Pay tax credit ($400 for individuals, $800 for couples) that went to most working Americans. The stimulus also included a number of other tax cuts: an $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers; an increase in the earned income tax credit; an expansion of the child tax credit; and a tax credit on a portion of the cost of college tuition. In addition, the stimulus made the first $2,400 of unemployment benefits tax-free and allowed people to deduct state and local taxes paid on a new car. And it extended the patch on the alternative minimum tax.In all, according to an analysis of the budget effects of the stimulus by the government's Joint Committee on Taxation, estimated tax relief to individuals and families in the 2010 fiscal year came to $173 billion.That may or may not be the largest one-year tax cut in American history -- it's hard to make direct comparisons -- but tax experts say it's at least in the conversation. And we note that Cohen hedged his claim some by saying there were more tax cuts in the past year than ""almost any time"" in our nation's history.However, critics contest Cohen's claim on several grounds. The biggest objection is that while there are tax cuts in the stimulus package, Democrats also recently passed a health care reform bill that includes a number of significant tax increases. Among them are a tax penalty for those who refuse to purchase insurance and a tax on so-called ""Cadillac"" health care plans. In all, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the cost of the new taxes in the health bill at upwards of $500 billion over the next 10 years.The health care bill is ""part of the story of the last year,"" said Ryan Ellis, tax policy director for Americans for Tax Reform. ""You can't ignore it.""In addition, President Barack Obama and many Democratic leaders have been saying for some time that they intend to allow the Bush tax cuts to expire at the end of the year for people making over $250,000.Most of the new taxes in the health care bill won't kick in for several years, and Congress has yet to take up the issue of whether to allow the Bush tax cuts to expire. But ""just because you haven’t quite gotten them yet doesn't mean it's not relevant to the story,"" Ellis said. ""I'm not sure how he (Cohen) can say that with a straight face.""Ellis and a number of other conservatives also take issue with calling the entirety of refundable tax credits ""tax cuts."" For many with low incomes -- and who end up not owing any income taxes at all -- tax credits come in the form of a check from the government. In government budgets, those are scored as spending. And the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that nearly a third of the tax credits in the stimulus fall under that category over the next 10 years.Ellis said that portion of tax credits amounts to a ""welfare subsidy.""But for most people, tax credits simply reduce their tax obligation.""They are tax cuts,"" said William Ahern with the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group. ""They just aren't the kind of tax cuts the Tax Foundation supports.""Tax credits for targeted purposes like buying a new car or home are too susceptible to special interest lobbying, Ahern said. The Tax Foundation supports income tax rate cuts. And we didn't see any of those this year.Even Church Marr, director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center of Budget Policy and Priorities, thinks Cohen may be overstating things when he says tax cuts this year rival any in history. The biggest ticket tax cut in the stimulus, the patch of the alternative minimum tax (accounting for $83 billion of the $173 billion worth of the stimulus tax cuts this year), is really just a continuation of previous policy.""I think you need to back that out,"" Marr said.Still, Marr said, the Making Work Pay tax credit was ""sizable and significant."" According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, it reduced taxpayers' burden by a total of $66 billion this year.""Taxes went down for most people,"" Marr said. ""And a lot of people don't really know that.""Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center agrees. ""Most Americans will see their taxes going down this year,"" Williams said.But he warns that tax increases are on their way. The country is running huge, unsustainable deficits, he said. The spending was intended to help pull the country out of an economic recession, he said, but there will be consequences. ""Anyone who thinks we won't have to increase taxes is dreaming,"" Williams said.On that point, there seems to be consensus from tax experts on all sides of of the political spectrum.But back to Cohen's statement: ""The fact is, in the past year we have had more tax cuts than almost any time in our nation's history.""Cohen has added enough qualifiers to his statement to make it defensible. He limits the window to this past year, and the Making Work Pay tax credit did translate to a significant tax cut for most working people this year. But if you take the AMT patch out of Cohen's equation -- and we think it's wrong to lump that in with the new tax cuts in the stimulus because it simply continued previous policy -- the case for having more tax cuts than any other year in U.S. history becomes a bit shakier. Still, Cohen never said it was the biggest, only one of the biggest.We also think it's likely that many would interpret Cohen's statement to mean that he was talking about all of the tax cuts and hikes enacted by Congress this year. And if that's the case, we think critics make a strong case when they note that health care tax increases, although most don't kick in for several years, were also enacted this year.We think that all shakes out to a Half True.",/factchecks/2010/apr/16/steve-cohen/obama-administration-has-enacted-many-tax-cuts-rai/

In a video posted March 25 on his campaign Web site, Green said, ""When you look at the nearly 150 men and women who have served us on the Texas Supreme Court, more than half of them had zero prior judicial experience."" We asked the Green campaign how it had done its research. Kara Green, the candidate's wife and his campaign treasurer, said the campaign relied on the Supreme Court's Web site and short biographies of the justices on the University of Texas Tarlton Law Library's Web site. Both sources list the justices starting in 1836, when the Texas Supreme Court was created after Texas gained independence from Mexico. Kara Green said the campaign found that 83 out of 148 justices -- 56 percent -- had no judicial experience before serving on the court, but the campaign didn't share their names with us. We jumped at the chance to explore Green's claim -- and with it, a fascinating slice of Texas history. The early years of the court, when Texas was a republic and not yet part of the United States, brim with stories of adventure and tragedy. In 1842, for instance, Justice Anderson Hutchinson was captured by the Mexican Army during a court session in San Antonio, forced to march to Mexico and held prisoner for months. We also learned that some of the Supreme Court's most respected members, including Chief Justices Robert W. Calvert and John Hill, had not previously warmed a judicial bench. Neither had a few of the court's most infamous justices, including Don B. Yarbrough of Houston, who resigned six months after being sworn in, in 1977, and eventually served time in federal prison. However, we couldn't find a definitive list of justices who came to the court without judicial experience. Officials with the Supreme Court and the Texas Supreme Court Historical Society, a nonprofit group that helps preserve artifacts related to the court, said they did not know how many there were. Professor James W. Paulsen of the South Texas College of Law in Houston, founding secretary of the historical society and an expert on Texas legal history, said he did not know of any studies that answered the question. With Paulsen's help, we did our own analysis using the Green campaign's sources: biographies on the UT library's Web site and the Supreme Court's list of justices. Right away, we ran into problems because the two lists of justices don't match exactly. For instance, the UT list includes more justices from the Republic of Texas than the court's list does, and it ends in 1986, while the court's list is current. Second, the biographical information for some early justices was incomplete, preventing us from being able to confidently determine whether they had prior judicial experience. Also, at least one biography of a Republic of Texas justice -- Shelby Corzine -- fails to mention judicial experience that he had in Alabama, according to Paulsen. After correcting for inadequate information, we wound up removing three justices from consideration. We also eliminated six more justices who Paulsen said should not be counted: Three because they never actually served on the court or were never confirmed for the job, or because of questions about the legality of their appointment or election. The last three were women whom Gov. Pat Neff appointed in 1925 to hear one case. Paulsen said that if all special judges of this kind were considered justices of the Texas Supreme Court, the list of names would grow considerably. (Those six names do not appear on the Supreme Court's list.) Bottom line: After making all these adjustments, we found that 65 out of 139 justices on the UT law library's list -- 47 percent -- had no prior judicial experience. On the Supreme Court's list, the breakdown was 62 out of 135 justices, or 46 percent. Neither amounts to ""more than half,"" as the Green campaign claimed. One footnote: Though both lists date back to 1836, Paulsen makes a good case for taking those Republic of Texas-era justices out of the lineup, primarily because the court in those days operated very differently from they way it does now. Only the chief justice was a statewide officer; the court's other members were the state's district judges -- trial judges -- who from time to time served as associate justices of the court. Though Green's campaign included those justices in its tally, we agree with the law professor's argument. And if you remove from the UT list the 22 justices who served only during the Republic of Texas, the percentage of those without prior judicial experience drops to 37 percent. For the Supreme Court list, the percentage would be 38 percent. The verdict? No matter how we sort the numbers, they show that the majority of high court justices had prior judicial experience. We rate Green's statement as False.",/factchecks/2010/apr/16/rick-green/rick-green-says-more-half-past-justices-texas-supr/

Palin says Americans spend 100 days paying off their tax burden
","On April 14, 2010, former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin addressed a tea party event in Boston and tried to characterize the scale of the tax burden in the United States.""Americans now spend 100 days out of the year working for government before we even start working for ourselves,"" she said.By making her point this way, Palin was using a yardstick that receives both attention and criticism every April 15, the day federal tax returns are due. So we thought it would be as good a time as any to look once again at the skirmishing over ""Tax Freedom Day."" (We last studied the question more than two years ago, when Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee cited a similar statistic.) Tax Freedom Day is the date when ""Americans . . . have earned enough money to pay this year's tax obligations at the federal, state and local levels,"" according to the Tax Foundation, the Washington, D.C.-based group that has calculated it for decades and also determined it retroactively back to 1900.The foundation calculates Tax Freedom Day by taking the amount of tax revenue collected and dividing it by national income created, producing ""an average tax burden for the U.S. economy as a whole."" That percentage is then multiplied by 365 to calculate the number of days over the course of a year it would take to pay off the entire tax burden. (The calculation counts every day of the year, not adjusting for weekends, holidays or leap years.)To determine tax revenue, the foundation adds together individual income taxes paid at every governmental level; payroll taxes, the federal levies that fund Social Security and Medicare; sales and excise taxes, which are typically collected at the state and local level; corporate income taxes; property taxes; and other miscellaneous taxes such as those for car licenses, energy or mineral production and estates.The Tax Foundation also offers state-specific Tax Freedom Days. These range from 85 for Alaska (Palin's home state) and Louisiana to 117 for higher-tax Connecticut. But the national average is 99.So if we measure Palin by how closely her figure tracks with the current Tax Freedom Day statistic, she scores well. She rounded up from 99 to 100 -- close enough in our book -- and she used the national average rather than any state figure, which is appropriate.Still, before giving Palin the Truth-O-Meter seal of approval, we need to determine whether she described the number's meaning accurately. And this requires delving into the annual debate over how useful the Tax Freedom Day concept is.The Tax Foundation's loyal antagonist in this annual battle is the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. CBPP doesn't suggest that Tax Freedom Day is a bad statistic; it acknowledges that it's a perfectly fine tool if you need to compare the level of taxation in different countries, or measure how the tax burden has changed over time.However, CBPP does cite a number of complaints. We're ignoring a bunch that aren't addressed by Palin's comment, such as concerns over how the state-by-state tax burdens are calculated.The one criticism by CBPP that we do think is relevant to Palin's comment is the argument that Tax Freedom Day ignores differences in how much Americans of different income levels pay in taxes.The Tax Foundation's number represents an average tax burden for the economy as a whole. But CBPP argues that the foundation's number is not a good measure of what a ""typical"" taxpayer pays. To explain the difference, CBPP offers the following example:""Suppose four families with incomes of $50,000 each pay $2,500 in taxes — 5 percent of their income — while one wealthy family with income of $300,000 pays $90,000 in taxes — 30 percent of its income. Total income among these five families is $500,000, and the total amount paid in taxes is $100,000. Thus, 20 percent of the total income of the five families goes to pay taxes. But the 20 percent figure is highly misleading as an indicator of the typical tax burden for families in this group,"" since four of the five families have tax rates just one-fourth of that amount.This is obviously an extreme case, and William Ahern, the Tax Foundation's director of policy and communications, countered that in the real world of taxation, the differences between taking a strict average (as the Tax Foundation does) and using a median figure (which would more closely reflect patterns of income distribution) aren't that great. CBPP cites research showing that the difference is significant.CBPP argues that there's enough income inequality in the United States, and enough progressivity in the tax code, to undermine the usefulness of Tax Freedom Day calculations. That's because a sizable majority of taxpayers must work significantly fewer days to pay off their tax bill -- and a minority must work significantly more days. So any attempt to suggest that Tax Freedom Day represents the experience of a typical American -- as opposed to one on the higher end of the income spectrum -- may be problematic.The good news for the Truth-O-Meter is that we don't have to resolve this dispute in order to rate Palin's comment -- we only need to make sure that Palin described accurately the statistic she was using. The bad news in this particular case is that Palin's phrasing is a bit elliptical, making it difficult to parse her words. Palin said, ""Americans now spend 100 days out of the year working for government before we even start working for ourselves."" That's pretty close to what the Tax Foundation said in its own release -- ""Americans will work well over three months of the year — from Jan. 1 to April 9 — before they have earned enough money to pay this year's tax obligations at the federal, state and local levels."" Both Palin and the Tax Foundation avoid saying that Tax Freedom Day represents the experience of ""a typical American,"" which would have been a more problematic phrasing. Our graduated tax system, which is weighted more heavily on the wealthy, means that the average amount paid is skewed upward by a smaller number of wealthy people who pay a lot. In other words, there are many, many more people who would fall under the 100-day threshold mentioned by Palin than over it. We think listeners take Palin as referring to what a typical American pays in taxes, since she didn't specify otherwise. Leaving that impression in listeners' minds, we knock her statement down to Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/apr/16/sarah-palin/palin-says-americans-spend-100-days-paying-their-t/
"['State Budget', 'Texas', 'Bill White']","
Bill White objects to what he calls ""Soviet-style"" budget management by Republican leaders
","In a public interview hosted by the Austin-based Texas Tribune, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White compared Republican leadership on state budget woes to how things swung in ye olde U.S.S.R. You remember, the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics -- home of the late dictator Joseph Stalin and run single-handedly by the Communist Party prior to the government's collapse in 1991. White said March 9 he’d take a more deliberate approach to spending than the state's top leaders, all Republican, who asked government agencies in January to suggest ways to cut their budgets by 5 percent. White said if he's in charge, ""it won’t be done by things that are just across the board, Soviet style, you know, budget management that only career politicians seem to embrace."" Pressed by interviewer Evan Smith, White said: ""Is it just a coincidence that 5 percent is the appropriate amount for each state agency?... No. It’s because that’s the way that career politicians know how to run government."" We started our review of White's statement wondering what ""Soviet-style"" budget management means. Several expert professors said that historically, the term didn't refer to across-the-board budget cuts. Professor Paul Gregory of the University of Houston Department of History said ""Soviet style"" makes him think of a monopoly party (in this case, the Communist Party) dictating everything to subordinates without any possibility of change. Gregory said Soviet-style budgeting also means hiding expenditures you don’t want people to see—such as massive investments in military infrastructure. Peter Caldwell, a Rice University professor of history, said budget-writing in the Soviet Union most often consisted of “huge and crude” decisions to invest in one part of the economy at the expense of another. And H. Stephen Gardner, chairman of the Baylor University Department of Economics, said he’d define Soviet-style management as overly centralized as opposed to giving autonomy to individual units of government. So are there ""Soviet style"" ways that state leaders have approached the budget? Some background: In January, Gov. Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus--mindful of a projected state revenue shortfall that could reach $15 billion by next January--jointly asked agencies to submit plans identifying savings in 5 percent “priority increments” in their 2010-11 appropriations from state revenue. Such plans could lead to cuts, though no decisions have been made and some programs have already been excused. No doubt, the leaders' request is a centralized one. But is it Soviet-style in any other way? We turned to White for elaboration. White’s campaign pointed us to a statement issued by White, the former Houston mayor, in January: “Well-run organizations cut spending based on priorities and where they can best attain productivity improvements. So, for example, in the city of Houston we made smaller cuts in public safety because that was the highest priority. And we were able to cut more in garbage collection and disposal through productivity improvements.” White then told us that by ""Soviet style,"" he doesn't mean that Texas state government owns the means of production, as in the Soviet Union. “Obviously we have a market system,” White said. He described his alternative approach to the looming revenue gap, saying that as governor, he'd focus on funding priorities such as education while encouraging agencies to improve productivity via ""process re-engineering"" without hurting the delivery of services to taxpayers. He said the state also would seek savings by renegotiating vendor contracts. Also, he said, there’d be regular meetings with agency chiefs to talk about how they’re cutting spending and avoiding non-essential hirings. “I would have had reports back to me weekly and monthly concerning the efficiencies identified,” White said. We didn't get to why White considers the existing approach ""Soviet style"" before he had to go. We asked the professors if ""Soviet style"" accurately characterizes the GOP leaders' request for proposed budget cuts. Gregory said describing the request from Perry, et al. that way “doesn’t seem to have any relevance to what was actually practiced in the Soviet Union. ... It's inappropriate to use that term."" Gardner agreed, saying: ""It’s a bit hyperbolic to refer to this (budget cutting) as Soviet style. I should admit I have done exactly the same thing myself on matters of budgeting.” The point of saying as much, Gardner said, is to elicit an emotional reaction. He added that Republicans who cast President Barack Obama as socialist — Perry has told reporters he thinks Obama has socialist beliefs — are likewise guilty of hyperbole for dramatic effect. The professor, who said he considers Obama a centrist, speculated that Noam Chomsky, a left-leaning linguist who writes on public affairs, would call the president a ""crazed capitalist."" ""If White’s point is that budget management is being handled in an overly centralized way,"" Gardner said, ""I can see the element of truth there. The problem I would have is even if you say I am going to be more careful and more surgically look at the right places to cut, you’re still using a more centralized approach.” Caldwell agreed with the psychological impact, if not the accuracy, of ""Soviet style."" Generally, he said, “anyone who ever mentions the Soviet economy or Naziism when they’re talking about American domestic debate is usually off track. They’re referring to crude examples to raise the stakes of a debate. They’re not necessarily wanting a careful, rational debate. Who in America wants the Soviet economy or supports Naziism?” Our conclusion? The GOP leaders' request that agencies submit proposed budget cuts isn’t Soviet style — not even close. At best, White's statement is an example of how politicians try to light up a room. It's so off base, we're lighting up the meter: Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2010/apr/15/bill-white/bill-white-objects-what-he-calls-soviet-style-budg/

300,000 in Florida lose health plans? More to the story than that
","Critics of the health care law like to throw around talking points that give the idea that the law will increase the ranks of the uninsured. The evidence, though, tends to contradict that. That hasn’t stopped political ads from continuing to push the point. The latest case: The race to replace the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla. Democrats are hoping to pick up the seat with Alex Sink, a former banking executive who’s previously held statewide office as Florida’s chief financial officer. Her opponents are David Jolly, a Republican and one of Young’s longtime aides, and Libertarian Lucas Overby. The National Republican Congressional Committee recently began airing ads attacking Sink for her support of President Barack Obama’s signature health law. The ads begin with photos of Obama and House Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. ""Alex Sink’s loyalty is to them, not Florida. Why else would she continue to support Obamacare? 300,000 Floridians will lose their current health plans,"" the ad claims in part, concluding, ""She’s fighting for them. Not us."" The ad phrases its claim very carefully, but its statement still leaves out much of the story. And where does that 300,000 number come from anyway? The number comes from 300,000 policyholders that insurance company Florida Blue identified back in October. That was when insurers were required to notify policyholders if their insurance plans didn’t meet the rules for new plans requiring comprehensive coverage. The rules were intended to phase out ""bare bones"" plans that didn’t include things like prescription drugs or hospital stays. Florida Blue had 300,000 customers whose plans didn’t meet the new rules. So Florida Blue sent them letters informing them that their plans would end and offering guidance on how to get signed up for a new plan. ""Florida Blue is proactively communicating to these members to help them understand how this transition affects them,"" the company said at the time. ""Prior to their 2014 renewal date, each member will receive a letter that instructs them to contact Florida Blue to review their migration options. These new plans will offer members access to more comprehensive benefits in 2014."" We should note that there’s a lot we don’t know about these 300,000 policyholders. For example, some of them may have gone to the federal marketplace to buy insurance. If their income was below 400 percent of the poverty level (below about $94,200 for a family of four, for example), they would have gotten a subsidy to buy insurance. Some of these people may end up paying more but getting more robust coverage. It’s unclear how many, if any, would simply stop buying coverage altogether. Back in October, Florida Blue told PolitiFact Florida that it intended to work with customers to get them into new plans. Spokesman Mark Wright said that when it comes to getting new plans, ""nobody is throwing anybody off a cliff."" We reached out to Florida Blue to see if it could tell us anything more about how the letters have played out. Spokesman Mark Wright said the company was giving their policyholders another year to keep their coverage after President Barack Obama asked insurers to allow customers who wanted to keep the old plans to keep them for an additional year.  One final note: PolitiFact Florida rated a similar but not identical statement claim from Sen. Marco Rubio back in October. Rubio said, ""300,000 people are going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don’t have health insurance."" PolitiFact Florida found that claim Mostly False because Rubio failed to fully explain the situation behind the number and wrongly insisted that the people wouldn’t have insurance in 2014. The NRCC’s claim doesn’t go quite as far. Our ruling The National Republican Congressional Committee said in an ad that ""300,000 Floridians will lose their current health plans."" We know that the insurer Florida Blue had to end plans for 300,000 customers when their plans didn’t meet the law’s new requirements for health insurance. But Florida Blue also said it intended to help its customers select and sign up for new health care plans, not leave them without options, and the customers got an additional year, if they needed it, to make a transition. The ad makes it sound as if people would lose their plans without any replacement.  Overall, we rate the ad’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/feb/14/national-republican-congressional-committee/300000-florida-lose-health-plans-more-story/

Democratic group says N.C. GOP Senate hopeful Thom Tillis supports a plan that would 'end Medicare as we know it'
","A race in North Carolina has become one of the top battles in the war to control the U.S. Senate. Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., is trying to win a second term and help keep the Democrats in control of the chamber. But she is expected to face a tough race against one of several Republicans competing in the primary. One of the leading candidates is Thom Tillis, the speaker of the North Carolina House. Patriot Majority USA, a pro-Democratic group operating independently of the Hagan campaign, has begun to run ads against Tillis, who has already benefited from a blizzard of ads against Hagan that were paid for by the conservative group Americans for Prosperity. Here’s the narration of the ad: ""In North Carolina, we put families first. But Senate candidate Thom Tillis sides with health insurance companies. He'd let them deny coverage for pre-existing conditions and raise rates for women needing mammograms. Tillis supports a plan that would end Medicare as we know it, and force seniors to spend up to $1,700 more for prescriptions. He's with the special interests; hurting North Carolina families."" We wondered whether it was true that Tillis ""supports a plan that would end Medicare as we know it."" In making the claim, the ad cites articles from the Raleigh News & Observer and Reuters in 2012 about Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who had just been tapped as Mitt Romney’s vice presidential nominee. The articles discussed how Ryan’s budget plan in 2011 would have made significant changes to the structure of Medicare.  Under Ryan’s plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. This proposal, known as ""premium support,"" would have affected people who today are under 55 only. Democrats called it radical and argued that it shifted too much of Medicare’s financial burden to beneficiaries. It was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Democratic-controlled Senate. We should note that the ad’s characterization of Ryan’s plan is more measured than the version of the talking point used by many Democrats in 2011 that was our choice as that year’s Lie of the Year. That version was that Republicans would ""end Medicare,"" period. We do wonder how many viewers would understand what the ad means by ending Medicare ""as we know it,"" though Democrats use the phrase routinely to describe the Ryan plan. We’ve found the ""as we know it"" phrasing to be highly subjective. Since the original proposal from 2011 failed to be adopted by the Senate, Ryan has offered updated versions of the plan. The most recent iteration of Ryan’s plan is less far-reaching than the original. The current version offers seniors younger than 55 the opportunity to choose the premium support model, rather than a requirement. Even introducing the option of premium support would be a significant change to Medicare, but since beneficiaries would be able to remain on traditional Medicare without being penalized, it seems doubtful that, as the ad says, the Ryan plan ""would end Medicare as we know it."" The bigger issue, though, is whether Tillis supports the Ryan proposal's ideas on Medicare. Does he?  We asked Tillis’ campaign manager and spokesman, Jordan Shaw, for Tillis’ position on the Ryan plan. ""He has said that there are some good ideas in versions of the Ryan plan, but has never gone to this level of dedication to every aspect of a specific version,"" Shaw said. This is a pretty vague position. Still, it gives Tillis room to say that he might prefer the current version of the proposal, which, by virtue of being optional, doesn’t fit the ad’s underlying claim that Tillis definitively supports changing Medicare as we know it. We couldn't find any more specific evidence that Tillis supports or opposes Ryan's ideas for Medicare.  Our ruling Patriot Majority USA said Tillis ""supports a plan that would end Medicare as we know it."" Tillis has acknowledged supporting aspects of Paul Ryan’s budget plan, but he hasn’t specifically said whether or not he supports the original Medicare provision that would have made significant and mandatory changes to the program. Tillis could clear this up by more forthrightly stating his views on the matter. Still, the ad exaggerates by assigning a specific position to Tillis that he hasn't actually taken. Overall, we rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/feb/14/patriot-majority-usa/demcratic-group-says-nc-republican-senate-hopeful-/

Of minimum wage workers in Rhode Island “only 14 percent serve as sole income earner for their family”
","Michael Stenhouse, chief executive officer of the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity, frequently appears on radio and in public forums to argue for lower taxes and, lately, to oppose efforts to increase Rhode Island’s minimum wage. Since July of 2009 the federal minimum wage has been $7.25 an hour. States are free to set their own minimum wage rates, as long as they don’t go  below the federal level. Last year, the General Assembly increased Rhode Island’s minimum wage to $8 an hour, effective Jan. 1, 2014, and there are proposals to increase it further. Stenhouse argues that the economic effects of raising the minimum wage are exaggerated by those who want to increase it. Most workers who support a family are already getting more than the minimum wage, he says, while those earning the minimum wage are usually young people supplementing an already above-the-minimum combined family income. On Jan. 27, in a news release, Stenhouse quantified that claim. Of Rhode Islanders who are earning minimum wage, he said, ""only 14 percent serve as sole income earner for their family."" When we asked Stenhouse about his statement, he said the source of the data was the Employment Policies Institute, a  business-backed, Washington, D.C.-based organization that produces research critical of state and federal minimum wages. The employment institute prepared the research for the Rhode Center for Freedom and Prosperity last spring, when the General Assembly was considering raising the minimum wage to $8.25, so that was the figure used in the study.  The legislature wound up approving an $8-an-hour minimum wage. The report is posted on the Center for Freedom and Prosperity’s website, rifreedom.org, with a pie chart that illustrates its findings. Michael Saltsman, research director of the Employment Policies Institute, told us that its analysis was derived from a regular monthly survey conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics in which people are asked about their incomes and family status, among other things. The institute found that, of Rhode Islanders earning less than $8.25-an-hour, 8 percent were single parents and 6 percent were married and the sole family earner. Stenhouse said he added those together to get his 14 percent. He said he picked those two categories specifically, because he was focusing on families getting by on minimum wage. We weren’t able to recreate Saltsman’s results, but other groups that have used the same data have ended up with similar findings. Heidi Shierholz is an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, based in Washington, D.C., that advocates increasing the minimum wage. She said the numbers Stenhouse used didn’t seem out of line, but she added he was carving a narrow demographic slice from the total population affected by minimum wage increases. But, as Stenhouse points out, he specifically limited his statement to families, not the broader category of households.     Our ruling Michael Stenhouse says only 14 percent of Rhode Islanders earning minimum wage or less are the sole earners for their families. Stenhouse was citing figures from an established research group that another research group, with an opposite political philosophy, found to be credible. The study he cited was based on an $8.25 wage, rather than Rhode Island’s $8 rate. But that’s not enough to make a big difference.

Perdue takes aim at Senate seat by highlighting his Dollar General days
","David Perdue’s U.S. Senate campaign grabbed headlines with some punch lines about some of his fellow Republicans in the race. In case you missed it, Perdue’s first television commercial had four crying babies dressed in outfits with the first names of some of his opponents. It was an attempt to portray himself as the adult in the race. Perdue also highlighted his business acumen in the ad, making a claim about his record as Dollar General’s chief executive officer from when he joined the company in 2003 until he left the business in 2007 that we wanted to check out. ""Four years later, the company added 2,500 stores and 20,000 jobs,"" he said.  We wondered whether Perdue was exaggerating about his tenure at the Tennessee-based company or did he accurately portray his record at the business. For those of you who haven’t paid any attention to the Senate race and think his last name sounds familiar, David Perdue is not that Perdue, but they are kin. Former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue is David’s first cousin. David Perdue has carved out an impressive career of his own as a business turnaround specialist. He was a top executive at the clothing company Haggar and Sara Lee, which is best known for its poundcakes. He was the CEO of the sports apparel company Reebok, where he was credited with balancing the books. Dollar General has more than 11,000 stores in 40 states. There are currently 588 Dollar General stores in Georgia, more than any state except Texas. Perdue joined Dollar General in June 2003 and stayed there until July 2007. The company keeps annual financial statements on its website. While the reports did not exactly match the dates of Perdue’s tenure at Dollar General, the annual reports show his claim has merit. The annual reports note the company’s ambitious plans to open 600 to 800 stores a year. In most years during Perdue’s tenure, Dollar General exceeded those projections. On Feb. 28, 2003, Dollar General had 6,192 stores and an estimated 53,500 full-time and part-time employees. On March 4, 2007, the company had 8,260 stores and about 69,500 full-time and part-time employees. That’s a four-year increase of nearly 2,100 stores and 16,000 workers. Campaign spokesman Derrick Dickey said those reports are not a reliable measuring stick to examine the accuracy of Perdue’s statement for a few reasons. First, as we agreed with the campaign, those reports do not entirely match Perdue’s tenure. Second, Dickey said, the reports do not reflect the decisions Perdue made that may have affected the company’s performance. ""The numbers we cited are based on our analysis of the added stores and jobs created that can be directly attributed to decisions made by David while he served as CEO of Dollar General,"" Dickey said via email. ""In an abundance of caution, we used thoughtful, conservative estimates of both numbers."" PolitiFact Georgia tried to compare the numbers for the first full year Perdue was in charge with his final year at Dollar General. The annual reports show Dollar General had 6,700 stores at the end of 2003 and 8,194 by the end of 2007. That’s an increase of about 1,400 stores. The number of additional employees totaled 13,700. So do we buy what this businessman says about his time at Dollar General? To sum up, Perdue said Dollar General added 2,500 stores and 20,000 jobs when he was the CEO.

Yet quite matter-of-factly, while touting a clean energy jobs bill she introduced, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin made the following statement Jan. 22, 2014: ""Over 3 million Americans are employed in the growing green-collar workforce, including in clean energy and sustainability, which is more than the amount of people working in the fossil fuel industry."" When we put the Wisconsin Democrat’s claim to Daniel Kish at the Institute for Energy Research, he told us that both green and fossil fuel industry job numbers are sometimes thrown around with abandon.  ""This gets really dicey real quick,"" he said. ""Everybody’s got their dueling banjos.""  That’s PolitiFact Wisconsin’s kind of music.  Baldwin’s evidence To back his boss’ claim, Baldwin spokesman John Kraus cited two reports. Both are from solid sources, though they mix sports coats and -- er, apples and oranges -- a bit. 1. Federal report In 2012, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics embarked on an annual tally of green jobs. The agency had the advantage of considering a definition of green jobs proffered a year earlier by the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C. think tank, which produced its own green jobs count. The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveyed 120,000 business and government establishments within 325 industries that were ""identified as potentially producing green goods or providing green services."" Those surveyed said whether they produced green goods and services and the percentage of their revenue or employment associated with that output.  Green goods and services were defined as those that ""benefit the environment or conserve natural resources."" They fall into one or more of the following five groups:  1) Production   of  energy  from  renewable  sources; 2) energy efficiency; 3) pollution reduction and removal, greenhouse  gas reduction,  and  recycling  and  reuse;  4) natural   resources conservation;  and  5) environmental compliance,  education  and training, and public awareness. So, the list of green jobs is quite varied, including jobs in areas such as farming; home construction; electric, solar and other types of power generation; petroleum and coal products manufacturing; urban mass transit; newspaper publishing; advertising and public relations services; waste treatment and disposal; museums and zoos; and social advocacy organizations.
 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics produced its second -- and, it turns out, final -- green jobs report in March 2013. It estimated that ""employment associated with the production of green goods and services"" -- full- and part-time jobs -- exceeded 3.4 million in 2011. Manufacturing, with 507,000 green jobs, was the largest sector. Goods produced by those jobs included air conditioning and refrigeration equipment meeting selected standards, hybrid cars and parts, and pollution mitigation equipment. Kish, who is senior vice president for policy at the industry-backed Institute for Energy Research, pointed out that 886,000 of the 3.4 million were government jobs -- not jobs, he said, in which people are ""making or installing windmills and solar panels.""  ""Green,"" Kish said, is a ""political word, used by politicians and advocates, that is truly elusive."" Nevertheless, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is well-established as the official jobs counter for the federal government.  The 2013 report, for the number of green jobs in 2011, remains the latest available. That report said that because of budget cuts, no more green counts would be done.  2. Think tank study The Brookings Institution report we noted above was produced in 2011, so it’s a little dated.  Brookings estimated that in 2010, there were 2.7 million green jobs -- that is, jobs that ""directly contributed to the production of goods and services that had an environmental beneﬁt.""  Brookings didn’t do a count of fossil fuel industry jobs, but it did make a comparison using federal government tallies. Its report said that in 2010, there were 1.3 million jobs that directly supported ""the production of fossil fuel-based energy, derivative manufactured products and machinery.""  If all wholesale and retail distributors, transporters and other workers -- such as gas station employees -- were included, the fossil fuel tally would be 2.4 million jobs, Brookings said. Brookings scholar Jonathan Rothwell told us some critics view the think tank’s definition of green jobs as too expansive. For example, some 350,000 public transportation jobs in the green tally include not only bus drivers but secretaries, janitors, executives and all other employees who work for bus companies, he said.  Brookings' definition of green jobs ""was very broad and included any economic activity that has an environmental benefit -- from public transportation to waste management,"" Rothwell acknowledged, adding that because ""only a small portion of energy comes from green sources, fossil fuel employees are a much larger share of the energy sector's workforce."" But Rothwell noted that the Bureau of Labor Statistics adopted a similar definition when it did green jobs counts. And we note that BLS arrived at a roughly similar green jobs estimate. So, the most recent federal report backs the first part of Baldwin’s statement, that there are more than 3 million green jobs.  The older think tank report she cites doesn’t say there were more than 3 million green jobs, but does say that green jobs outnumbered fossil fuel industry jobs as of 2010. Other views One thing to underline here is that counting green jobs is a different sort of animal.  As CNN/Money observed when the first Bureau of Labor Statistics green jobs report came out in 2012, comparing ""green jobs to another singular sector isn't really fair. The green jobs survey took into account a wide variety of jobs in over 300 different industries."" As for the oil and gas industry itself, a July 2013 report was done by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and natural gas industry, that was an update of a report done two years earlier.  The later report said there were 2.59 million jobs in the oil and natural gas industry in 2011. PricewaterhouseCoopers said it utilized data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau for its study. The study noted that the oil and natural gas industry ""encompasses a number of activities that span separate industry classifications in government economic data."" For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production is included in the mining sector; and oil refining is part of the manufacturing sector. The study defined the oil and gas industry to include all such activities.  The petroleum institute noted to us criticism of how the federal government defines green jobs, including an editorial in Investor’s Business Daily that called the annual count ""phony."" A final note:  In November 2012, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, made a claim similar to but more broad than Baldwin’s, saying there were ""more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas in this country.""  That was before the latest reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and American Petroleum Institute that estimated green and fossil fuel jobs for 2011. PolitiFact Rhode Island rated the statement True. Our colleagues noted that at the time, the number of green jobs as estimated by BLS exceeded the number of oil and gas jobs estimated by the petroleum institute. Our rating  Baldwin said: ""Over 3 million Americans are employed in the growing green-collar workforce,"" which is more than the number ""of people working in the fossil fuel industry."" The latest estimates are for 2011. The federal government says there were 3.4 million green jobs, while a national oil and gas trade group says there were 2.59 million oil and gas jobs.

Business lobbying group says 'large parts of Florida' had 'years of below average rainfall'
","Florida may be the Sunshine State, but what really sets it apart is its water -- where it comes from, how much there is and who uses it. Lawmakers are paying more attention to water policies in an election year. That means the business-backed lobbying group Associated Industries of Florida is also announcing a new group to help the state make decisions about water quality and quantity. In a Feb. 6 press release, AIF announced the H20 Coalition, a group described only as ""stakeholders"" who plan to help mold legislation for water laws. The group points out some reasons for this marked interest. ""Years of below average rainfall in large parts of Florida combined with reduced infrastructure spending during the recession, have exacerbated a growing shortfall in water supply across the state, drawing the attention of Florida's businesses, environmental groups, utilities and government,"" the release said. It seems like there’s been a lot of rain across the state lately. Is it true swaths of Florida have been experiencing a persistent lack of rain over the years? We decided to examine the rain gauges and find out. Rain check The state’s main groundwater supply is the Floridan Aquifer, which also supplies parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. The aquifer’s network loses water as it is pumped out of the ground through wells or city water systems, and relies on rainfall to recharge water levels. Andy O’Reilly, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geologic Survey’s Florida Water Science Center in Orlando, says that across the state, anywhere from less than one to 25 or more inches of annual rainfall has the potential to soak into the aquifer, depending on the local geology. Even much of that ends up as runoff in rivers and streams. The rest of the precipitation either evaporates or is used by plants for transpiration. ""Rainfall is the biggest component in maintaining the aquifer on a regional level,"" he said, noting that the Floridan Aquifer is particularly sensitive to precipitation levels -- and from overpumping by homes and industries during dry spells.  So the first thing we did was look into statewide rainfall totals. Checking in with the Florida Climate Center provided a quick look at statewide totals over the years. Over the last 30 years, Florida has averaged a little more than 54 inches of rain per year, among the highest in the country. Going back to 2000, an extremely dry year, there have been five years of below-average rainfall statewide (2012 was the most recent complete year available): Yr ‘00 ‘01 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 Avg 43.2 54.5 59.4 61.1 59.2 62.7 42.6 45.2 55.1 56.0 49.1 48.9 55.5   So, five out of 13 years were below average, which is about 40 percent. We checked the state’s five water management districts, designed to tend to water resources across Florida. AIF said that ""large parts"" of Florida had below average rainfail, so numbers by district give us a sense of how rainfall measures up on a regional basis. For instance, the Southwest Florida Water Management District, which extends from parts of Marion County down to Sarasota County, has a 30-year rainfall average of 51.2 inches. For that district, rainfall totals were: Yr ‘00 ‘01 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 Avg 37.8 45.6 56.9 65.9 62.9 55.1 45.8 39.5 50.7 47.5 53.3 46.6 51.1   So there were six years out of 13 that were below the regional average, which is about 46 percent. The South Florida Water Management District, covering the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Palm Beach metroplex over to Fort Myers and Naples, extending north of Lake Okeechobee into Orlando, has a 30-year average of 51.4 inches. Its rainfall totals were: Yr ‘00 ‘01 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 Avg 39.4 53.2 54.3 53.3 48.4 60.0 40.7 42.8 53.3 48.4 48.9 49.3 52.2   There are seven years below that average since 2000, or about 54 percent. The data is broken down different ways in different districts, but all of them give you a decent idea of which parts of the state are experiencing less rainfall than usual. In the Northwest Florida Water Management District, covering the Panhandle from Escambia County to the western half of Jefferson County, district-wide data isn’t kept, but rather organized by cities where rainfall totals are measured. In Panama City, for example, the 30-year rainfall average is 61 inches. They’re an example of a location being hit by some below average years lately: Yr ‘00 ‘01 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 Avg 41.2 50.4 49.0 64.7 46.3 52.6 42.5 35.8 57.8 53.6 48.7 38.7 65.8   That means 11 years between 2000-12 had below average rainfall, or 85 percent. What the climatologists say But do these numbers mean there’s a shortage of rainfall in the state? Climatologist David Zierden with the Florida Climate Center says no. While it’s true there have been some drier years than normal in the past decade or so, there have been plenty of wetter than average years, too. He said 2013 was the 14th or 15th rainiest year on record since 1895. Tracking average rainfall means ""there will be some winners and some losers,"" Zierden said. Sometimes the totals are above the average, and sometimes they’re below, which is the nature of Florida’s rainfall. This is a pattern that repeats across the state’s climate zones. He added the state has been in and out of drought over the last decade, but recent years are no worse than 2000 and 2001, which coincided with three dry years of La Nina conditions. ""Here in Florida we’re really dominated by year-to-year totals,"" he said. ""There’s no statistically significant trend at work here."" Those rainfall variances, as inconsistent as they may be, still mean parts of the state have had dry years, and hydrologist O’Reilly said they still could affect the aquifer. That’s because the recharge rate is not a direct ratio to the rainfall total; for example, a 20 percent decrease in rainfall could mean quite a bit more than a 20 percent decrease in the recharge rate. Overall, the accumulated effects of rainfall deficits and surpluses combine with the rate at which people pump water out of the aquifer to affect the water supply’s long-term balance, he said. The AIF press release doesn’t mention overpumping from the aquifer as part of the problem maintaining the water supply, but some experts say that would be the real driver of any shortfalls. And commercial interests, especially agriculture, are responsible for most of that overpumping during dry periods. Tom Swihart, the former head of the Office of Water Policy in the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, says not only are estimates of future water supply shortfalls historically too high, but currently funded water projects all but meet those goals. Water usage by residents is on a downward trend as well, not just in Florida, but nationwide. But even keeping that in mind, ensuring quality should take precedent over quantity, Swihart said. ""All of this concern about water supply deflects attention from the much more serious problem of excessive nutrients in Florida waters,"" he said, referring to the proliferation of fertilizers, pesticides and dangerous chemicals in the water supply from the industries for which AIF lobbies. ""That truly is a statewide issue and needs urgent attention."" Our ruling The Associated Industries of Florida said in its press release that ""large parts of Florida"" have experienced ""years of below average rainfall."" While parts of Florida have had below-average rainfall, we also saw years of above-average rainfall. Climatologists told us the state overall is doing fine, thanks to the years when it was above average. Most recently, 2013 was the 14th or 15th rainiest year on record since 1895. While the record on rainfall is mixed, there are other issues that affect water levels in the aquifer. Overpumping for residential and commercial uses, especially during dry spells, has a lot to do with the dwindling water supply as well, but AIF, which lobbies for business interests that pump from the aquifer, makes no mention of that. The claim is partially accurate, but leaves out important details.

Pro-Democratic group says North Carolina Senate candidate Thom Tillis would let pre-existing condition protections disappear
","A race in North Carolina has become one of the top battles in the war to control the U.S. Senate. Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., is trying to win a second term and help keep the Democrats in control. But she is expected to face a tough race against one of several Republicans competing in the primary. One of the leading candidates is Thom Tillis, the speaker of the North Carolina House. Patriot Majority USA, a pro-Democratic group operating independently of the Hagan campaign, has begun to run ads against Tillis, who has already benefited from a blizzard of ads against Hagan that were paid for by the conservative group Americans for Prosperity. Here’s the narration of the ad: ""In North Carolina, we put families first. But Senate candidate Thom Tillis sides with health insurance companies. He'd let them deny coverage for pre-existing conditions and raise rates for women needing mammograms. Tillis supports a plan that would end Medicare as we know it, and force seniors to spend up to $1,700 more for prescriptions. He's with the special interests; hurting North Carolina families."" We wondered whether it was true that Tillis would let insurance companies ""deny coverage for pre-existing conditions."" In making the claim about pre-existing conditions, the ad cites a Charlotte Observer article from Sept. 23, 2013. That article, in turn, cites a comment from Tillis that we tracked back to a news release from his campaign. In it, Tillis said in part, ""Many have asked where I stand in the battle to defund Obamacare. … I believe Obamacare is a mortal threat to our economy. It will decrease health care quality and raise health care premiums, and Republicans should do everything in our power to undo it. That means we must use every tool available to us."" A spokesman for Patriot Majority told PolitiFact that ""Tillis wants to repeal the ACA. Fact. If you repeal the ACA then … people could be denied coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Fact."" But is it as simple as that? Not necessarily. It’s fair to assume that if Obamacare is repealed -- and, importantly, if nothing is passed in its place -- then the law’s consumer protections against getting denied for a pre-existing condition would disappear with it. But at least some Republican congressional leaders have been saying that they want to ""repeal and replace"" the law. In fact, just in the past few weeks, three GOP senators -- Richard Burr of North Carolina, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Orrin Hatch of Utah -- have put forth a proposal that would do just that. Most important to this fact-check, their proposal would keep the pre-existing conditions protection in Obamacare -- a provision that’s generally popular even among critics of the overall law. The Burr-Coburn-Hatch proposal isn’t as ironclad on pre-existing conditions as Obamacare is. It would allow a one-time window to get pre-existing conditions grandfathered into coverage, and protection as long as coverage is continuous. But beyond the initial grandfathering period, any lapse in coverage would mean the next policy someone buys would not necessarily cover pre-existing conditions. This protection isn’t as sweeping as it is under Obamacare, but it’s better than what existed before Obamacare. For the purposes of this fact-check, however, we will consider this to be one way of keeping some form of pre-existing conditions protection. So we checked with Tillis’ campaign to see whether he supported the Republican plan or if he wants simply to repeal Obamacare, as the ad suggests. Here’s what Tillis’ campaign manager and spokesman, Jordan Shaw, said: ""Speaker Tillis doesn’t believe that the Affordable Care Act is the only way to address health care problems. While he hasn’t officially endorsed the Burr-Coburn-Hatch plan because he hasn’t had a chance to discuss it in detail with Sen. Burr, he does think there are many good ideas in the plan. It is certainly a positive step toward a conservative alternative to Obamacare."" So Tillis is open to legislation that would replace Obamacare, but he hasn’t endorsed the main Republican plan currently on the table that, among other things, would include some protections for people with pre-existing conditions. So what about his past statements? Has Tillis said the health care law should be replaced with something that keeps popular elements of the law in place? We asked Shaw twice if he could provide documentation -- in speeches, news releases or videos -- of cases where Tillis made this point. But he didn’t reply. So we looked ourselves. We didn’t find any. Most often, we found, Tillis has used the word ""repeal"" without adding ""replace."" For instance: • The ""Meet Tom"" page on Tillis’ website: ""As North Carolina’s U.S. senator, Tillis will push for repeal of Obamacare, a balanced budget, and conservative economic policy."" • A statement criticizing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.: ""My campaign to beat Kay Hagan is the key to a new conservative majority that will repeal Obamacare and balance the budget."" • A tweet during the State of the Union address: ""Obamacare's not working. Support repeal & end its $819.3 billion tax burden. #AskObama --> http://dld.bz/dg7Ca  #SOTU."" The closest he comes is another page on his website, where he says, ""Thom will fight in the Senate for full repeal of Obamacare, for defunding Obamacare, and he will work to implement private-sector solutions to reduce health care costs for North Carolinians."" Still, not only is his support for ""private-sector solutions"" vague, but he specifically cites solutions that ""reduce health care costs,"" not ones that keep people from getting insurance if they have pre-existing conditions. Tillis is engaged in a primary against candidates fighting to win support among Republican base voters who are the hardest-line opponents of Obamacare. Given this situation, acknowledging that there are even small parts of Obamacare worth saving can be electoral suicide. However, constantly calling for repeal without acknowledging there may be a need to replace the law with something else makes it hard to be too critical of an ad that infers that he would let insurance companies ""deny coverage for pre-existing conditions."" Our ruling Patriot Majority USA’s ad said Tillis would let insurance companies ""deny coverage for pre-existing conditions."" Tillis’ staff says he is open to replacing the law, perhaps with the Burr-Coburn-Hatch proposal, but he hasn’t endorsed it yet. More importantly, we don’t find examples in which Tillis has publicly advocated replacing Obamacare with something else, at least not prior to our asking him about it in regards to this ad.  Given all of this, we can’t really blame Patriot Majority USA for drawing the conclusion that Tillis would repeal Obamacare and not replace it. Still, we're left with an element of uncertainty about what Tillis' position on pre-existing conditions actually is. Overall, we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/feb/13/patriot-majority-usa/pro-democratic-group-says-north-carolina-senate-ca/

Fox's Stirewalt: New rules force firms to deny Obamacare leads to downsizing
","The Obama administration’s latest step to delay implementation of the Affordable Care Act gives employers more time to offer health insurance to their workers. The so-called employer mandate was suppose to kick in this year. About six months ago that was pushed back to 2015. As of this week, medium-sized companies, those with 50 to 99 employees, will now have until 2016. The president’s critics responded quickly. ""The White House seems to have a new exemption from its failed law for a different group every month,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. On Fox News, Chris Stirewalt speculated that a wrinkle in the newly announced rules was meant to silence companies that were just a little over the 99-worker mark -- and might be tempted to get under it. ""Firms will be required to certify to the IRS – under penalty of perjury – that Obamacare was not a motivating factor in their staffing decisions,"" Stirewalt said. ""To avoid Obamacare costs you must swear that you are not trying to avoid Obamacare costs. You can duck the law, but only if you promise not to say so."" Stirewalt’s point was that this was designed to stifle public discussion about the health care law and jobs. That’s an uncheckable theory, but a reader on Facebook asked us if we could test the specific claim that firms must tell the IRS – under penalty of perjury – that they didn’t fire workers simply to avoid paying for their health insurance. The worker clause In the new rules released Feb. 12, a company qualifies for the year delay if it: Employed 50 to 99 full-time workers in 2014. Did not cut workers in order to get under the 99-worker bar. Cutting the workforce for bona fide business reasons is fine, including if sales dip or an employee isn’t up to snuff. Did not eliminate or ""materially reduce"" the health coverage it offered as of February 2014. If a company meets those conditions, it has to tell the government, formally, under the rules of something called Section 6056. Jennifer Kraft, a lawyer who tracks the Affordable Care Act at the Seyfarth Shaw law firm, said some firms might find themselves navigating the nuances of these requirements. ""Employers would need to be mindful of whether there are other bona fide business reasons for making any workforce adjustments if they are trying to get the protection of this transition relief,"" Kraft said. So Stirewalt is partially correct to say that companies can’t simply fire workers to gain an extra year before they need to offer health insurance. That’s not quite as broad as Stirewalt put it ""to avoid Obamacare costs"" but the rule certainly is part of Obamacare. Plus, a firm has to meet three conditions, not just the one Stirewalt mentioned, and report that to the government. But the matter of the risk of perjury seems to rest on much shakier ground. We asked Fox News and lawyers who focus on ACA law if they could point to the law that spells out the penalties for failing to comply under Section 6056. We heard nothing from Fox News and the two lawyers were uncertain. Lisa Klinger, a benefits attorney with the Leavitt Group, a large insurance brokerage, guided us to an IRS proposed rule on 6056. A paragraph there said the reporting requirement would be ""subject to the general reporting penalty provisions under sections 6721 (failure to file correct information returns), and 6722 (failure to furnish correct payee statement)."" We’re just concerned with reporting to the government so we looked at the law for 6721. That law makes no mention of perjury. In fact, Klinger found it took a lighter approach. ""It doesn’t look like it comes with huge penalties,"" Klinger said. The reality is that the IRS has yet to release the rule that lays out what will happen if a company tells the government it didn’t lay workers off because of Obamacare when in fact it did. In a press release, the agency said final regulations will be out shortly. Our ruling Stirewalt said that under penalty of perjury, companies will need to tell the government that any downsizing they underwent was not due to Obamacare. The reporting part is partly accurate. Employers can lay people off but they can’t do so just to get under the 99-worker mark and get an extra year before they need to offer health insurance. There seems to be no support for the element that perjury charges await the firm that falsely reports why it downsized. Those rules have yet to be released. The claim gets a key piece of information wrong. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/feb/13/chris-stirewalt/foxs-stirewalt-new-rules-force-firms-deny-obamacar/

Dan Patrick, both trying to capture the tea party vote in the Republican primary, did earlier this week when posed a question about repealing the 17th Amendment."" The 17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1913, did away with state legislatures electing U.S. senators and handed that power directly to the people. It begins, ""The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote."" At the time, the 17th Amendment was seen as a move away from corruption and toward purer democracy, according to an Oct. 10, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news blog post and an Oct. 16, 2013 Statesman news story. But tea party activists, particularly in Texas, describe it as a mistake that reduced state power by undoing an intended balance between U.S. representatives elected locally by the people and U.S. senators more accountable to state legislators. Another Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, Texas land commissioner Jerry Patterson, said in a Waco Tribune-Herald interview published Feb. 2 and in subsequent emails to us that Patrick and Dewhurst each said in an Oct. 3 debate that he favored repeal, then changed his tune at a Jan. 20 King Street Patriots debate. Patterson and another GOP candidate, Texas agriculture commissioner Todd Staples, who weren’t asked about repeal at the October debate, each said at the later debate that he opposes repealing the amendment, according to a YouTube video that King Street spokesman Logan Churchwell told us by phone accurately presented the candidates’ responses. To gauge whether Dewhurst and Patrick flip-flopped, we reviewed the cited debates, checked news accounts and reached out to their respective campaigns. (Our check of Patrick’s statements is here.) When a Statesman reporter asked Oct. 8 whether Dewhurst supported the amendment’s repeal, Dewhurst campaign spokesman Travis Considine replied by email, ""That is accurate."" His response included Dewhurst’s comment at the Oct. 3 debate held in Houston by the Clear Lake Tea Party, plus web links to news and social media accounts of Cruz, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and prominent Republicans around the country saying they favored repeal. Rauf wrote in an Oct. 16 Express-News news story: Asked by Patrick at a Houston-area debate if he supports repealing the amendment, Dewhurst pounced. ""You betcha, Kemosabe,"" he replied. ""Right now, many members of Congress, United States senators and United States congressmen, don't have a feeling for what the states need."" According to the Oct. 10 Statesman news blog post, Dewhurst went on to say: ""Believe me, with the absence -- a reversal of the 17th Amendment -- would make all of our United States senators listening daily to the heartbeat of the legislatures and not be passing the laws that cost all of us. Which affect your freedoms and cost you tax dollars that you should never reach into your pocket to pay."" At the Jan. 20 King Street debate in Houston, according to the YouTube video, Dewhurst said, ""I would not be in favor of repealing the 17th Amendment if for no other reason than pure practicality. It’s not going to happen."" We reached out to the Dewhurst campaign about his conflicting answers and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Between the October and January debates, Dewhurst shifted his declared position on repealing the amendment from ""You betcha, Kemosabe"" to ""I would not be in favor of repealing the 17th Amendment.""

But tea party activists, particularly in Texas, describe it as a mistake that reduced state power by undoing an intended balance between U.S. representatives elected locally by the people and U.S. senators more accountable to state legislators. Another Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, Texas land commissioner Jerry Patterson, said in a Waco Tribune-Herald interview published Feb. 2 and in subsequent emails to us that Patrick and Dewhurst each said in an Oct. 3 debate that he favored repeal, then changed his tune at a Jan. 20 King Street Patriots debate. Patterson and another GOP candidate, Texas agriculture commissioner Todd Staples, who weren’t asked about repeal at the October debate, each said at the later debate that he opposes repealing the amendment, according to a YouTube video that King Street spokesman Logan Churchwell told us by phone accurately presented the candidates’ responses. To gauge whether Dewhurst and Patrick flip-flopped, we reviewed the cited debates, checked news accounts and reached out to their respective campaigns. (Our check of Dewhurst’s statements is here.) An Oct. 10 Statesman news blog post quoted Patrick as saying at the Oct. 3 debate held in Houston by the Clear Lake Tea Party: ""I unequivocally support the repeal of the 17th Amendment and the restoration of our Founders' original intent to have the state legislatures select our United States senators. ... It is absolutely necessary that the 17th Amendment be repealed to revitalize our republican system of government."" 
At the Jan. 20 King Street debate in Houston, according to the YouTube video, Patrick said: ""I think this came up in a debate about four months ago. We’ve had many debates. And I think either I misspoke or I was misquoted or it was reported incorrectly; I’m not sure which. ... I would not be in position to support repealing it today. I was just taking a historical view of it and I think that was a turning point; it hasn’t worked out, I think, as planned, but I would not be in favor of repealing it."" Patrick spokesman Logan Spence told us by email that there was ""No flip. Dan just doesn't think now is the time to have that fight."" We asked how this ""not now"" position coheres with Patrick flatly saying at the January debate that he is not in favor of repeal. Spence replied that as a candidate for lieutenant governor, Patrick is not positioned to lead the charge for repeal ""now or in the near future."" He also said, ""This must be my last time to address this."" Our ruling Between the October and January debates, Patrick shifted from saying ""I unequivocally support the repeal of the 17th Amendment"" to ""I would not be in favor of repealing it."" Given an opportunity to explain the contrast, his campaign said Patrick wouldn’t be positioned as lieutenant governor to lead the repeal charge and that there would be no further clarification. Our sense is that Patrick himself said he was for repeal, then said he is not. That’s a Full Flop. FULL FLOP -- A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop. UPDATED Feb. 13, 5:07 pm: This story was updated to restore a paragraph defining the 17th Amendment that had been omitted due to an editing error.",/factchecks/2014/feb/13/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-went-unequivocally-support-would-not-b/

Ralph Reed says alternatives to Keystone pipeline are worse for environment
","Republicans are rejoicing over a new government report about one of the biggest controversies of the day. Nope, not Obamacare, but good guess. It’s on the Keystone XL pipeline. As liberal CNN Crossfire host Van Jones argued against President Barack Obama approving the project in a recent show, conservative activist Ralph Reed said a U.S. State Department study clears the air about the project’s long-term effect on the environment. (We rated Jones’ statement about the project creating 35 permanent jobs True.) ""What the report shows, Van -- and this is irrefutable; the science is clear -- is that the alternatives to the pipeline are worse,"" he said. ""If you use primarily tanker trucks to transport this shale gas, climate emissions will be 28 percent higher than the pipeline. If you use primarily rail, they'll be 40 to 42 percent higher."" ""So if you're protecting the environment, you should build the pipeline."" We wanted to check out his claim that the pipeline is better in terms of fewer climate emissions than the alternatives, including doing nothing. Read this if you’re kind of late to Keystone  The proposed Keystone XL pipeline would stretch from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb., ushering 830,000 barrels of heavy, diluted Canadian tar sands per day to refineries on the Gulf Coast with help of existing pipelines. TransCanada’s project crosses international borders, so the company had to file an application for a presidential permit. As part of the process, the president directs the Secretary of State to determine whether the project ""serves the national interest."" Secretary of State John Kerry has not yet issued his recommendation. The issue splits environmentalists and labor unions, putting Kerry and Obama under unusual pressure from a divided Democratic Party. Republicans and labor unions tout the pipeline’s construction jobs, reduced dependence on oil from other continents and continued friendliness with Canada, while environmentalists want Obama to send a strong message about climate change. Back in June, Obama said the country’s national interest ""will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution."" Many headlines about an 11-volume State Department report about the pipeline’s environmental impact focused on its finding that the pipeline project would not significantly contribute to carbon pollution, which some see as giving Obama an opening for approval. That does not mean the project is without impact. The report examined the greenhouse gas effect of the project, finding that the emissions primarily from electricity use to power pump stations, fuel for vehicles and vented or leaked methane would be comparable to about 300,000 cars operating per year, or more than 70,000 homes using electricity for one year. An important thread in the debate is an assurance from Canadian officials and oil producers that oil will reach the American marketplace even if the pipeline is not built. So the State Department compared the environmental impact of other methods of moving the oil south from Canada. What could happen without the pipeline?  Producing crude oil from oil sands is complicated. The sands are comprised of clay, sand, water and a substance called bitumen, a thick, soft asphalt-like material that is too dense to traverse pipelines on its own. It is diluted with lighter substances and heated to make it easier to move, resembling more of a heavy crude oil called dilbut. The process is energy-intensive, and the transportable material is corrosive and difficult to clean up, opponents say. By law, the department had to consider the environmental impact of reasonable alternatives to the pipeline. The State Department investigated three alternative transportation methods: If you had a hard time visualizing how all of that would work, consult the State Department’s map laying it out (or read the 100-page description). Our focus is on how these alternatives affect carbon emissions. We modified a chart in the State Department report for annual greenhouse gas emissions from crude transport from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf Coast. (MTCO2e = Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents) Proposed Keystone XL pipeline Rail/pipeline scenario Rail/tanker scenario All rail to coast scenario MTCO2e/Year per 830,000 barrels per day 3,123,859 4,428,902 4,363,611 3,991,472 MTCO2e/Year per 100,000 barrels per day 376,369 533,603 525,857 480,900 Percentage difference from proposed Keystone n/a 41.8 percent 39.7 percent 27.8 percent   Reed’s numbers for carbon emissions from the alternative scenarios pretty much align with the report, but he mixed them up. He said, ""If you use primarily tanker trucks to transport this shale gas, climate emissions will be 28 percent higher than the pipeline. If you use primarily rail, they'll be 40 to 42 percent higher."" In reality, using primarily rail raises carbon levels 28 percent more than the pipeline and using primarily tankers raises carbon levels 40 percent, the report said. Reed also said tanker trucks, when the report is actually speaking of tanker ships. Using a combination of rail and existing pipeline would yield 42 percent more carbon emissions. Not exactly a clean bill of health Reed is broadly onto something with the report, but environmental activists criticized his statement, saying the science on the climate safety of shale oil is hardly clear. Reed’s statement dismisses the fact that the project would generate more greenhouse gases than the alternative desired by environmentalists: doing nothing to expand tar sands production. ""It’s all worse"" for the environment than doing nothing, said Eddie Scher, a spokesman for the Sierra Club. ""The argument here is that crack is somehow worse than heroin. We think that you should do neither."" Extracting oil from tar sands is more ""carbon intensive"" than other crude oil. It’s 13 percent more carbon intensive than other heavy crudes and 17 percent more than the average barrel of crude oil refined in the U.S. in 2005. If Keystone XL is rejected, ""tar sands expansion will slow,"" said Anthony Swift, National Resources Defense Council international program attorney. Even the Environmental Protection Agency raised concerns with the State Department about the possibility of tar sands being easily shipped by rail instead of the pipeline. In April, the EPA argued in response to a State draft environmental assessment that the department should improve its energy-economic modeling strategy and dig in deeper to rail capacity and costs. Basically, their assumptions are too rosy, EPA says. Our ruling Reed said the State Department report shows ""the science is clear"" that ""alternatives to the pipeline are worse,"" pointing to higher emissions from alternate transportation options of tanker trucks and rail. Reed didn’t pull the numbers out of anywhere, although he did mess them up a bit, for instance by saying ""tanker trucks"" instead of sea ""tankers"" described in one of the report’s alternative scenarios. As to his general point that the pipeline option is better in terms of CO2 emissions than projections for other options, yes, those alternatives are worse. But besides getting his numbers crossed, he was also a bit clumsy in describing ""alternatives"" and saying that if ""you're protecting the environment, you should build the pipeline."" Reed assumes that the pipeline should be built, but environmentalists say the best alternative for the environment would be to do nothing and slow tar sands production. Reed’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Cookie-hawking Girl Scouts not teaching girls to emulate pro-abortion icons
","Think twice about buying Girl Scout cookies, a national group urges, because participating girls are taught to admire ""pro-abortion women."" A reader told us she fielded a Feb. 4, 2014, email blast with that message signed by Judie Brown, president of the Virginia-based American Life League. One of the blast’s claims: The Girl Scouts of the USA ""curriculum now promotes Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, Betty Friedan, founder of NARAL Prochoice, and other pro-abortion women as icons for our children to emulate."" According to a biographical sketch posted online by Harvard University, Sanger was a nurse and lecturer who opened the country’s first birth-control clinic and later founded the American Birth Control League (which was renamed the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1942). Friedan, according to another Harvard web page, famously authored ""The Feminine Mystique,"" published in 1963, which ""fueled the controversy over women's proper place in society and had a dramatic impact on women in the United States and abroad. Friedan quickly became the leading advocate for change in the status of women."" In 1966, Friedan helped found the National Organization for Women (NOW), a civil rights organization for women, serving as its first president, according to the web page, and later was vice president of the National Association to Repeal Abortion Laws and also on a Girl Scouts USA board. By telephone and email, Paul Rondeau, the league’s executive director, credited a former Girl Scouts troop leader, Christy Volanski, with the research behind the claim. The league calls itself the largest grass-roots Catholic pro-life organization in the nation. Let’s take the Girl Scouts’ ""promotion"" of Sanger and Friedan one by one. Margaret Sanger Rondeau told us that after the group sent its email blast, Volanski made it clear that the Girl Scouts’ ""promotion"" of Sanger was not directly in the scouts’ curriculum; instead, that occurred via social media. Volanski, of Spring, Texas, guided us to the Pinterest page for Girl Scout Cadettes, meaning scouts in grades six through eight, includes a link to a May 17, 2013, entry on""The Eloquent Woman"" blog created by Denise Graveline, a public speaking coach and communications consultant based in Washington, D.C. The blog entry lists 13 speeches on human rights by women including Sojourner Truth, Clara Barton, Margaret Chase Smith, Eleanor Roosevelt, Lady Gaga, Betty Friedan and Sally Field. The Sanger entry says: ""Women's rights to birth control were Margaret Sanger's campaign in the 1920s, and for her efforts to speak out on this issue, she was arrested and ignored and fought. Her focus was the children born ‘unwelcome, unwanted, unprepared for, unknown,’ a stirring bit of alliteration."" That entry links to another web page describing and excerpting a speech by Sanger in 1925 on the results of overpopulation and a lack of birth-control options.  A web link leads to the full March 30, 1925, speech, posted on an Iowa State University website, in which Sanger argued for women to be free from ""enforced, enslaved maternity. There can be no hope for the future of civilization, no certainty of racial salvation,"" she said, ""until every woman can decide for herself whether she will or will not become a mother, and when and how many children she cares to bring into the world."" We saw no mention of abortion on the Sanger web pages. Betty Friedan Friedan appears in the Girl Scouts’ curriculum, Volanski told us, as one of the exemplary women described in bottom-of-the-page blurbs in ""Your Voice, Your World, The Power of Advocacy,"" a 2008 guide for older scouts interested in learning about how to make a case for change. The guide, which we obtained from Austin-based Girl Scouts of Central Texas, has more than 50 of the ""Voices for Good"" blurbs, each one about specific women and their actions/achievements in the years from 1792 through 2007. Two blurbs mention Friedan, neither one touching on abortion or her involvement in starting the abortion rights action league. In 1963, the guide says, Friedan published ""The Feminine Mystique,"" ""attacking the belief that homemaking and childbearing are the only ways for women to find satisfaction in their lives. She postulates that a system requiring women to find their identity solely as wives and mothers stunts them. The book galvanizes the women’s movement."" In 1966, the guide says, Friedan and Pauli Murray, the first black woman Episcopal priest, wrote the mission statement for the National Organization for Women, with a declared purpose of women gaining full participation in American society in ""true equal partnership with men."" Today, the guide says, the group’s priorities include an end to violence against women. Other women described in the blurbs include prominent figures in the Democratic Party, which has championed abortion rights. The women include Texan Barbara Jordan, the first woman to keynote the Democrats’ national convention; Geraldine Ferrraro, the 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee; Hillary Clinton, singled out for seeking health care reform in 1993; and Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress. Other women blurbed in the guide include Sandra Day O’Connor, the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court; Mother Teresa, the Roman Catholic nun who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979; civil rights icon Rosa Parks; Eleanor Roosevelt; Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a union organizer who helped launch the American Civil Liberties Union in 1920; and Dolores Huerta, co-founder in 1962 of what became the United Farm Workers and an organizer for women’s equality and other causes. We spotted no mentions of abortion or birth control in the 103-page guide. By phone, we asked Volanski if the women touted in the guide represent a mix of Americans. ""They do have a couple of conservative ladies in there,"" Volanski said, mentioning Mother Teresa. ""I’d say it’s wide-ranging,"" she said, yet more of the chosen women are ""left-leaning,"" making the mix unbalanced, she said. Girls Scouts respond On a ""What We Stand For"" web page, the Girl Scouts of the USA says: ""The Girl Scout organization does not take a position on abortion or birth control. We believe this is a private matter for girls and their families."" By phone, Kelly Parisi, spokeswoman for the New York-based Girl Scouts, said the scouts’ curriculum does not depict Sanger, Friedan and other women as pro-abortion icons. Parisi noted that the entry on the Pinterest page created for scout Cadettes points to a web page listing speeches by 13 women; that is, it doesn’t promote Sanger alone. Also, Parisi said, the Friedan blurbs in the scouts’ guide state only that she wrote her book and helped found NOW, Parisi said, not delving into her position on abortion access. ""You cannot talk about women’s history in this country without mentioning Betty Friedan,"" Parisi said. Asked about Volanski’s suggestion that the mix of listed advocates is unbalanced, Parisi replied: ""We’re not trying to be balanced because we’re not trying to promote a political agenda. We don’t vet these women based on their political beliefs."" ""We are a nonpartisan, nonpolitical organization,"" Parisi said. Rondeau, by email, said our sampling of the blurbs in the guide (which we’d shared with him) demonstrates its pro-abortion slant in that all but two of the women whose blurbs we noted had shown such a lean, while only Mother Teresa clearly believed otherwise. ""The pattern seems quite clear,"" Rondeau wrote. Our ruling The league said Girl Scouts USA’s curriculum ""promotes Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, Betty Friedan, founder of NARAL Prochoice, and other pro-abortion women as icons for our children to emulate."" A Girl Scouts’ Pinterest page--not the scouts’ curriculum--leads to a blog post highlighting speeches by 13 women, including one by Sanger. The scouts' advocacy guide, part of the organization’s curriculum, features two blurbs on Friedan and also thumbnails other women who have advocated abortion rights. However, none of the guide's 50-some biographical blurbs mentions any woman's activism per abortion as a reason for singling her out. Abortion is not mentioned elsewhere in the guide, either. We find no factual reason to conclude that the scouts are teaching girls in this vein. We rate this claim as False.",/factchecks/2014/feb/13/american-life-league/cookie-hawking-girl-scouts-not-teaching-girls-emul/

Bachmann didn’t say Bible was written in English, and neither did Texas governor
","After Coca-Cola aired a multilingual Super Bowl ad, a photo-quotation circulated on Facebook suggesting that U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., disapproved. The Coke ad, featuring ""America the Beautiful"" sung in seven languages, provoked a backlash on Twitter and criticism from conservatives who objected to hearing parts of the patriotic song performed in tongues other than English. ""If English was good enough for Jesus when he wrote the Bible it should be good enough for Coke,"" Bachmann is quoted as saying in the graphic posted Feb. 3, 2014, by ""Christians for Michele Bachmann."" It attributes the alleged quote to a Fox News appearance that same day. Bachmann, a former presidential candidate, has supported making English the official language of the U.S., but we found no evidence that she uttered the ""good enough for Jesus"" line. Bachmann spokesman Dan Kotman told us by email, ""Congresswoman Bachmann never said that quote, and actually didn’t even appear on Fox News that day. It’s 100 percent fake."" It’s fake — and not even new. A hoax-debunking blog called Waffles at Noon collected 2013 versions of the Bachmann meme in a Feb. 4, 2014, post, and said the earliest one also bore the logo of ""Christians for Michele Bachmann,"" which it described as a satirical Facebook page. But it didn’t start with Bachmann. We found that the ""Bible written in English"" line is so old it was used to make fun of Texas’ 1925-27 governor, Miriam Ferguson, to whom versions have also been attributed. And it’s even older than that, tracing back to at least 1881. Wall Street Journal language columnist Benjamin Zimmer investigated the ""Bible in English"" meme in an April 29, 2006, post on a linguists’ blog at the University of Pennsylvania. The oldest iterations, he wrote, were jokes about an 1881 translation of the Bible, rather than about the English language specifically. Zimmer cited a May 23, 1881, New York Times story about clergymen’s reactions to the new Bible. One preacher, the story says, told his congregation a joke that ended thus: "" ’What's the matter with the good old King James version?’ the farmer replied. ‘That was good enough for St. Paul, and it's good enough for me.’ ""

Charlie Crist says six Floridians die a day due to lack of Medicaid expansion
","Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, now running for his old position as a Democrat, has attacked Republican Gov. Rick Scott for his tepid support for Medicaid expansion last year. Scott had said he would support it, but he didn’t lobby for it, and ultimately the state Legislature rejected the expansion. In a Feb. 7 interview on MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown, Crist said that means ""about 1 million of my fellow Floridians are not getting health care today, and I’m told by my friends at (the Service Employees International Union) that means that six people in Florida die as a result of that every day."" Is Crist’s diagnosis correct? Do six Floridians die a day because the Legislature rejected Medicaid expansion? The Health Affairs study Crist’s claim comes from a study released in late January on the blog of the health-policy journal Health Affairs. It was authored by researchers from Harvard University and the City University of New York. The researchers looked at states that had opted out of Medicaid expansion, including Florida, where about 1.27 million people would have been eligible. Researchers then used prior studies about the effects of expanding insurance to estimate a low-end number and a high-end number of deaths for each state that didn’t expand Medicaid. In Florida, the study concluded, the number of deaths would range from 1,158 to 2,221. The only state with more projected deaths was Texas. Crist arrived at his six-deaths-a-day figure for Florida by using the high end of the range cited in the study -- 2,221 deaths divided by 365 days a year works out to six deaths a day. If he had used the low-end figure, it would have worked out to three deaths per day. So what were the underlying studies? They were: • The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, a comparison of about 6,000 patients who got a slot in a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn’t. The study tracked factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, depression, and out-of-pocket medical spending. (PolitiFact has previously written about the mixed results of the health outcomes found in the Oregon study.)   • A study by Harvard researchers Benjamin D. Sommers and Katherine Baicker compared three states that expanded Medicaid -- New York, Maine and Arizona -- with neighboring states that didn’t expand it. This is what the Harvard/CUNY researchers used to calculate their high estimate of deaths and was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2012. The sample consisted of adults who were observed five years before and after the expansions, from 1997 through 2007. • A study by Harvard researchers about health insurance and deaths. This produced the low-deaths estimate. The study was published in 2009 in the American Journal of Public Health; it followed indivduals over 16 years. (Two of the authors of this study are also authors of the new Harvard/CUNY study.) The Harvard/CUNY study arrived at the death figures by looking at the number of individuals with depression, the number of patients on diabetic medications, the number of women who had a mammogram or pap smear in the past year and the number of people who had catastrophic medical expenses in the past year. We interviewed two of the authors of the study, including Harvard professor Danny McCormick. The lack of Medicaid expansion will mean that patients nationwide won’t get certain diagnostic tests or take certain medications. ""Cumulatively, that amounts to vast numbers of deaths,"" McCormick said. We asked McCormick how researchers can know that the differences in the death rates between the Medicaid expansion states and the states that didn’t expand were as a result of Medicaid. ""We don’t know absolutely because we didn’t do a randomized control trial with long-term followup on millions of people,"" McCormick said. ""For $10 billion we could do that study."" Experts weigh in on study We asked a variety of health policy experts their opinion about Crist’s claim. Many experts told PolitiFact that denying Medicaid to poor Floridians will harm their health. But placing a precise figure as to how many will die per day, they added, is difficult. ""There is strong consensus in the public health community that this is a very harmful policy,"" said Harold Pollack, who told PolitiFact he is a ""liberal health policy wonk"" at the University of Chicago. However ""the most difficult aspect of that policy to investigate is its effect on mortality."" Pollack said Crist is on solid ground to point out that the lack of Medicaid expansion causes serious harm. However, ""I personally believe that these mortality estimates were on the high side of an inherently difficult calculation."" Pollack pointed to a 2009 study by Richard Kronick, then a University of California San Diego medical professor who later went to work for the Department of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. His study concluded that the risk of mortality is no different for uninsured respondents than those covered by employer-sponsored group insurance. Uninsured individuals can still get some health care, but they use fewer services than the insured, which increases their risk, said Jonathan Oberlander, who studies health care politics and policy at the University of North Carolina. ""There are different estimates in the literature of how much uninsurance increases mortality (and at least one significant study that doesn’t confirm that claim),"" Oberlander told PolitiFact. ""But in general I’d say that former Gov. Crist is on solid ground in saying that Florida's decision to not expand Medicaid could lead to more deaths from uninsured Floridians, which could have been reduced if the state expands Medicaid.  However, getting an exact number is difficult. There are estimates, and the Health Affairs study is just one estimate."" Some of the criticisms we heard focused on shortcomings of the underlying studies. George Washington University professor Leighton Ku said that the Sommers/Baicker study looking at the mortality in a few states was ""relatively rigorous"" but warned that it came with caveats. The authors wrote acknowledged that it may not be possible to generalize its findings to other states. Also the study states that it ""cannot definitively show causality."" ""It makes sense to believe that giving low-income people Medicaid health insurance coverage will lead to improved health access and improved health and could eventually reduce mortality,"" Ku told PolitiFact in an email. ""But it is important to recognize that it might take a number of years before such an effect is realized."" Ku said that the new Medicaid death study ""is somewhat speculative, but plausible. It did not go through the more rigorous peer review that would normally be required to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. I think there is pretty good evidence that Medicaid saves lives, but how many and how long it takes is a little harder to say.""   Other scholars are more critical of the study. Duke University professor Chris Conover, an adjunct scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the study of three states only found a statistically significant decrease in mortality in New York and that the New York benefits are more generous than most states. The study, he said, doesn’t prove that the reasons for the differences between mortality in New York (which expanded Medicaid) and Pennsylvania (which didn’t) result from differing approaches to expanding Medicaid. ""If people are willing to overlook the study’s clear methodological limitations to claim it ‘proves’ Medicaid saved lives in New York, then they have to be prepared to concede that Maine and Arizona’s Medicaid programs evidently had no impact on mortality,"" Conover wrote in his blog. Baicker, author of one of the underlying studies, said that the new study is ""a blog post (rather than a refereed article), so I really can't speak to the quality of methods they use."" ""The point of most studies like this is to take estimates of the effect of a particular program and forecast what would happen to a population overall based on those estimates,"" Baicker said. ""All such estimates come with uncertainty, and don't point to the specific individuals or, for example, specific times of death."" Our ruling Crist said that Florida’s decision not to expand Medicaid means that ""six people in Florida die as a result of that every day."" The statistic is based on a recent study, but experts note a few caveats. First, Crist used the study’s high-end figure; using the low-end figure cuts the number of deaths to three a day. Second, experts caution about uncertainties about the studies upon which the new study was based. And third, while many experts agree that it’s plausible to assume that the lack of Medicaid coverage could lead to deaths, they were careful to add that it is difficult to pinpoint a number as precise as the one Crist offered.

Were Kip Kinkel and Clackamas Town Center shootings both stopped by an armed citizen?
","Gun-control proposals, both in Oregon and nationally, continue to generate controversy. Even ideas with widespread public support, such as universal background checks, ignite fierce debates. That much was clear Feb. 6, 2014, when Mark Kelly, the husband of former Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords -- who was critically injured in a 2011 shooting -- testified at an Oregon legislative hearing in favor of a bill that would expand background checks. A member of the Oregon Citizens Lobby, a conservative activist group, took to Twitter to say that Kelly was testifying. The tweet indicated that Kelly’s remarks included mention of Kip Kinkel, who shot and killed his parents before killing two fellow Thurston High School students in 1998, and the Dec. 11, 2012, shooting at Clackamas Town Center that left three people, including the shooter, dead. ""He mentions Kip Kinkle (sic) & Clackamas TC,"" the tweet continued, ""both where citizen with gun stopped the crime."" The tweet caught our attention. Were both of those tragic incidents halted when armed citizens intervened? PolitiFact Oregon checked. We checked the Oregon Citizens Lobby’s website but found it contains no phone numbers. It does list email contacts for subjects including health care, taxes, education and ""law enforcement, military and firearms."" We emailed the latter and received a reply from someone who identified himself only as ""Bill D., Team lead, Oregon Citizens Lobby, Law Enforcement, Military and Firearms."" (In a subsequent email, he declined to give his full name.) Regarding the Town Center shooting, Bill D. wrote, ""Clackamas Mall is easy...the Oregonian covered it well."" The email provided a link to a story in The Oregonian and on OregonLive.com, which reported the account of Nick Meli, who told authorities he trained his own gun on mall shooter Jacob Tyler Roberts. Meli didn’t shoot for fear of hitting a bystander, according to one of several statements he gave to police and reporters. The story added that Meli also told a local television station that Roberts appeared to spot him ""and that afterward, Meli heard only one more shot, and suspects it was the one Roberts used to kill himself."" Bill D.’s email then addressed the Thurston High School shooting. It retracted that part of the initial tweet, saying: ""...other students (unarmed) tackled Kip Kinkel. The tweet was likely in error here."" So far, the group, was batting .500 on the original tweet’s accuracy. We agree that no one with a gun stopped Kinkel. News accounts and official reports show that brothers Jake and Josh Ryker and classmate Tony Case tackled Kinkel while he was trying to reload and held him until police arrived. To fact-check Meli’s role in the Town Square shootings, we called the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office, which took the lead in investigating the incident. ""It’s inconclusive on our end,"" said Lt. Robert Wurpes, office spokesman. ""We can’t say either way whether he did or did not make a difference. It would only be speculation."" Other news accounts in the days after the shooting indicated that Meli changed his story slightly. According to police reports, Meli’s first contact with deputies took place as the search for Roberts was still unfolding. Meli had a handgun out when officers first saw him. He provided information about the shooter but did not mention a confrontation with Roberts. The next day, Meli told police he saw Roberts and drew his gun but didn’t fire out of fear of striking someone. The day after that, Meli added that Roberts looked at him and saw that Meli saw him before running off, according to a story by Rick Bella of The Oregonian. After that, Meli cut interviews short. His silence, Bella wrote, ""has effectively divided the public into two camps: One that believes Meli is a hero, a good guy with a gun who stopped a bad guy with a gun, preventing further bloodshed. The other believes Meli embellished his story to take undue credit."" When we emailed the Oregon Citizens Lobby for a response, ""BD"" responded by writing: ""Cops will not declare that a private citizen stopped a shooting unless the evidence is absolutely incontrovertible. Quotes from them are usually taken before an investigation is complete and they of course don’t want to prejudice the investigation."" A member of the Oregon Citizens Lobby tweeted during a gun-control hearing that the Thurston and Clackamas Town Center shootings were stopped by armed bystanders. The Oregon Citizens Lobby acknowledged it erred in the Thurston case. Nick Meli’s role at Clackamas Town Center remains open to debate. Did his drawn weapon prompt the shooter to flee? There is no proof that it did. We rate the claim False. After publication, we heard from Tony Case, who told us he was shot by Kinkel and that he did not help tackle the shooter. News accounts at the time differ, but we are the first to acknowledge that Case is in a position to know.

Clay Aiken says GOP legislator voted 21 times to shut down government
","Even though Clay Aiken has never run for public office before, he’s no stranger to getting a lot of votes. Now, after announcing his run for a U.S. House seat in North Carolina, the Democrat will have to hope supporters are as eager to flock to the polls as they were to text in their American Idol votes a decade ago. It won’t be an easy road to Washington for Aiken, who will face a Democratic primary. In his YouTube campaign kickoff, which Simon Cowell would probably call ""pitchy,"" Aiken criticized his would-be general election opponent, Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C. ""The district where I’m running is represented by a congresswoman who I believe went to Washington with good intentions. I’d like to think that people don’t go there with anything else,"" Aiken said. ""When her party leaders told her to vote for the government shutdown, she did. Twenty-one times. Even though she said herself it would be a disaster for the economy."" We can’t know what party leaders told her about how to vote. But we wanted to know if Ellmers voted 21 times to shut down the government, as Aiken claimed. Aiken’s office sent us a list of the 21 votes they counted. By contrast, Ellmers’ staff gave us a list of 24 votes she gave ""to keep the federal government open."" Interestingly, there was significant overlap. How the votes stack up We combed through congressional votes during the fall of 2013 and came up with our own list of 26 votes in the battle over funding President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, and how it related to the government shutdown. To be clear, there was never a measure that was a straight up-or-down vote to dirctly shut down the government. Rather, it was a series of votes on measures that the House supported but that the Senate and President Obama opposed, that had the predictable effect of shutting down the government. In the House, Republicans controlled which measures get brought to the floor for a vote. Here’s a breakdown of House votes from that time period: Pre-shutdown, votes 478, 497, 498 and 504: These votes took place on the budget in late September and were in support of the House Republican budget, which fully funded the government but defunded Obamacare or delayed its individual mandate. While Ellmers’ votes were in favor of GOP budget proposals, they were made knowing that Obama had said he would veto the legislation if it hit his desk, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown. Rule changes, vote 505: In the early hours of Oct. 1, as the shutdown began, House Republicans voted to alter the rules to make it impossible for an individual legislator to force a vote on reopening the government. Piecemeal appropriations during shutdown, votes 506, 507, 508, 510, 513, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 528, 530, 532, 537, 540, 542, 544 and 548: Ellmers and Republicans voted in favor of these measures during the shutdown to fund different parts of the government individually. That included everything from re-opening federal museums to funding Head Start to funding cancer research. This was a tactical move on both sides of the aisle. Most Democrats opposed these measures in order to continue their push to fund the government in its entirety. Meanwhile, the Republicans used these votes as leverage against the Democrats, saying the Democrats refused to fund a laundry list of federal programs. Forming a working group, vote 534: Mid-shutdown, Ellmers and other House Republicans voted to form a bipartisan working group of senators and representatives to work out economic policy differences and reopen the government. But party leaders made it clear they didn’t want to compromise on a delay of Obamacare’s individual mandate, which was a sticking point for the Democrats. Ending the shutdown, vote 550: Ellmers voted against this, along with a majority of House Republicans. It passed with support from Democrats and a block of 87 Republicans, including Speaker of the House John Boehner. Once Obama signed off on it Oct. 17, this bill ended the shutdown and funded the government through Jan. 15 in place of an annual budget. Ellmers’ record By pointing out how Ellmers and other House Republicans voted in September and October, we’re not trying to absolve the Democrats of any responsibility for the government shutdown. To be sure, both parties shoulder responsibility for building up partisan gridlock. Here, though, we wanted to take a close look at how Ellmers voted during the shutdown. Her record shows she voted with other Republicans to take a hard line on withholding funding for the health care law, even to the point of shutting down the government, and she also voted against the final deal that re-opened the government. Her remarks on the subject contradict those votes. Back in August, she said the shutdown wasn’t the right strategy. After it ended, she said, ""I’m happy we are out of the government shutdown,"" even though she didn’t vote in favor of ending it. It’s also worth noting that Republicans have maintained that their votes for piecemeal appropriations are easily framed as votes to fund the government. Our ruling Aiken said Ellmers ""voted for the government shutdown"" 21 times. After reviewing the legislation, we found 26 votes from before and during the shutdown that were related. Ellmers consistently voted with Republicans, who wanted to defund Obamacare even at the cost of not funding other government functions.  But not all of the votes contributed directly to a shutdown, and Aiken's 21-vote tally is inflated. The bulk of these votes are piecemeal appropriations votes, which were tactical maneuvers by Republicans to try to restart the more popular government functions without funding the health care law. Overall, Aiken has a point that Ellmers repeatedly voted with those who took positions against compromise. Most significantly, she voted for budget measures that precipitated a shutdown and also against the final compromise measure that re-started the federal government. But to say she voted 21 times for a shutdown is an exaggerated number. So we rate Aiken’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/feb/12/clay-aiken/clay-aiken-says-gop-legislator-voted-21-times-shut/

Snow response comparison faulty
","Kansas City, Mo., Mayor Sly James came to the defense of Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed for what Reed acknowledges was a poorly timed response to Atlanta’s recent snowjam. ""That mayor down there’s getting blame for a lot of stuff he’s got nothing to do with, and I understand that,"" James told the morning rush-hour audience on AM 750 and 95.5 FM WSB. ""So I’m always going to defend mayors, especially when I know how good they are."" ""A major snow event in Atlanta, for them to respond to that, is kind of equivalent to us responding to a major earthquake,"" James said. ""It just doesn’t happen that often."" As Atlanta hunkers down for its second snow of the year, we wondered about James’ comparison for a couple of reasons. First of all, roads covered in snow and ice can certainly be hairy and dangerous. But could they be worse than the ground shaking and potentially opening up from an earthquake? Secondly, just how often does Kansas City have a major earthquake? And how’s that compare with the frequency of crippling snowstorms in Atlanta? We decided James’ statement merited further scrutiny. We contacted Dan Deocampo, an associate professor and chairman of the department of geosciences at Georgia State University. ""Actually, major snow events in Atlanta occur more frequently than major earthquakes in Kansas City,"" he said. The last major earthquake affecting Kansas City was about 200 years ago in the New Madrid Fault Zone, although there was a magnitude 5.6 quake that shook the city in 2011, Deocampo said. ""The likelihood of strong shaking in the Kansas City area is pretty low compared to San Francisco or Los Angeles,"" said Robert A. Williams, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Colorado. ""But it's not zero likelihood."" By contrast, the city of Atlanta has had 11 snowstorms of 4 inches or more over the past 80 years. The biggest was on Jan. 23, 1940, when 8.3 inches of the white stuff blanketed Atlanta, according to the National Weather Service at Peachtree City. In March 2009, 4.2 inches of snow fell, forcing some school districts to close for a day, Delta Air Lines to cancel about 300 round-trip flights and about 12,000 metro Atlantans to lose electricity. The city’s biggest snowfall since then took place in January 2011, when 3.7 inches were recorded at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, according to the weather service. On Jan. 28, the date of Atlanta’s most recent snow, 2.6 inches fell at the airport, and hundreds of motorists and schoolchildren were stranded for hours, some even overnight, in cars and schools. For longtime Atlantans, that conjured up memories of ""Snowjam"" 1982, when 7 inches fell on the city over three days and streets and interstates were immobilized. Bill Murphey, the state climatologist and chief meteorologist for the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, said the snowstorms on Super Bowl Sunday 2000 and in January 1973 were arguably among the more notable. The snap, crackle, pop of electrical transformers due to ice in 1973 ""really paralyzed the city,"" he said. The January 2000 event also created widespread power outages, Murphey said. As far as average snowfall amounts go, Atlanta sees about 2.1 inches a year. That is based, Murphey said, on 69 years of data up to 2009 from the Southeast Regional Climate Center. We contacted the mayor’s office, where spokesman Carlos Campos was unaware of James’ remarks. He said the mayor has said repeatedly that the city  failed to help coordinate closing times in an orderly manner with schools, businesses and government agencies. ""He is pleased, otherwise, with the response as it concerns restoration of roads to normal within a little more than 24 hours,"" Campos said. James said responding to a major snow event in Atlanta would be like Kansas City responding to a major earthquake. He was coming to the defense of another mayor, Atlanta’s Kasim Reed, whom he saw as unfairly castigated for events beyond the mayor’s control. That’s fair. But to compare cleaning up the mess from 2 inches of snow  to recovering from a major earthquake rattles the very heart of the Truth-O-Meter. One is relatively common over the span of decades. The other, extremely rare. The Kansas City mayor overreached on this one. We rate James’ statement False.  ",/factchecks/2014/feb/12/sly-james/snow-response-comparison-faulty/
