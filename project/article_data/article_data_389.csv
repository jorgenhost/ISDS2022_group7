Donald Trump says if you're from Syria and a Christian, you can't come to the U.S. as a refugee
","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been making many bold statements recently, but one that caught a PolitiFact reader’s eye involved religion and the admittance of refugees into the United States. ""If you're from Syria and you're a Christian, you cannot come into this country, and they're the ones that are being decimated. If you are Islamic ... it's hard to believe, you can come in so easily,"" Trump said in a speech in Las Vegas on July 11, 2015. ""In fact, it's one of our main groups of people that are coming in. Now, not that we should discriminate against one or the other, but if you are Christian, you cannot get into the country. You cannot get into the country."" Trump has made similar arguments before, such as in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network in June. So we decided to see if Trump’s claim was accurate. Neither Trump nor the White House responded to an inquiry, but we did communicate with representatives of a range of refugee-assistance groups and scholars who study the issue. The most that can be said for Trump’s claim is that there is a sizable difference between the number of Muslims and the number of Christians that have come into the United States as refugees so far. Between Oct. 1, 2014, and July 17, 2015, according to federal data, 859 Sunni Muslims, five Shiite Muslims and 42 people identified only as ""Muslim"" arrived in the United States as refugees from Syria, for a total of 906. Meanwhile, 28 Christians arrived from Syria. (Other arrivals included two atheists, two of the Baha'i faith and one with no stated religion.) So, on its face, Trump’s claim that you ""cannot come into this country"" if you’re a Christian from Syria is wrong. Still, this data finds that 96 percent of the refugee arrivals from Syria were Muslim, compared to only about 3 percent who were Christian. However, it’s important to keep in mind that the population of Syria is overwhelmingly Muslim to start with. The CIA World Fact Book says Syria’s population is 87 percent Muslim and 10 percent Christian. In other words, the refugee numbers are a bit more heavily Muslim and a bit less Christian than the population at large, but not dramatically so. ""While there may be higher numbers of Muslims from Syria who have come to the U.S. than Christians, this is not reflective of any policy making it easier for Muslims and harder for Christians,"" said Shaina Ward, associate director of Refugee Council USA. Ward noted that the the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees does most of the initial screening of refugees seeking resettlement. UNHCR, she said, ""identifies and refers the most vulnerable, whoever they are,"" using a variety of criteria in addition to religion More importantly, there is no evidence whatsoever for the most explosive element of Trump’s charge -- that the U.S. government is discriminating against Christians as a matter of official policy. ""The U.S. refugee resettlement program is open to Muslims and Christians, as well as to members of other targeted religious groups,"" said Jennifer Moore, a law professor at the University of New Mexico. Karen Jacobsen, a professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy, agreed, calling Trump’s charge ""completely untrue."" ""The U.S. government does not discriminate on the basis of religion in refugee admission or resettlement, and if you look at refugee admissions by religion over the past 10 years, rather than just at the Syrian refugees in the past few years, there are likely more Christians than Muslims,"" Jacobsen said. Representatives of three human-rights groups we contacted -- Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Refugee Council USA -- also agreed that Trump’s accusation is off-base. Geoffrey Mock, the Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, agreed, adding that he has ""worked with Christians from Egypt and Syria, so I know they are getting in."" Some experts argued that the biggest problem with the refugee flow from Syria is not that it’s discriminatory against Christians, but that the trickle has been so small. In September 2014, the State Department wrote that ""the refugee crisis caused by the conflict in Syria is the worst the world has witnessed in a generation, with more than 2.9 million refugees in the region. More than 9 million people need assistance, including 6.5 million displaced inside Syria."" Yet the U.S. government, as noted before, has let in a tiny fraction of those numbers -- less than 1,000 in the past nine months, and only about 2,500 prior to August 2014. One reason for the small number of admittances is the long process facing refugees. Once a case is referred from the UNHCR to the United States, a refugee must undergo a security clearance check that could take several rounds, an in-person interview, approval by the Department of Homeland Security, medical screening, a match with a sponsor agency, ""cultural orientation"" classes, and one final security clearance. The background checks are often particularly complicated for refugees who were forced to flee their homes without the opportunity to gather important paperwork. Given these requirements, Susan Martin, a professor of international migration at Georgetown University, takes issue with the claim by Trump that if you’re a Muslim, ""you can come in so easily."" ""I know from my own research and the literature on resettlement that no one comes in 'easily,’ "" she said. ""The security checks are very comprehensive and very time consuming. When I was looking at resettlement of Iraqi refugees in Jordan a few years ago, I met with a number of families who had been approved for admission to the United States by the Department of Homeland Security but were awaiting their security checks. Most had been waiting for months, including families with young children who were in need of specialized medical care. I don't think any of them would have characterized the process as easy.’ "" A final note: There is one step that the U.S. government could take if it wished. It could give Christian refugees from Syria a leg up on resettlement by granting them status as a ""priority 2"" or ""P-2"" class -- ""groups of special humanitarian concern identified by the U.S. refugee program,"" according to the government. P-2 groups have long included Jews, evangelical Christians, and Ukrainian Catholic and Orthodox religious adherents from what used to be the Soviet Union, as well as dissidents from Cuba and a variety of religious minorities in Iran. It also included Vietnamese refugees until 2009 and Bosnian refugees during the 1990s-era civil war. It now includes Iraqis who helped United States military or diplomatic efforts after the Iraq War, as well as certain Burmese, Bhutanese and Congolese refugees. So far, no group from Syria, Christians or otherwise, has been granted this status. Our ruling Trump said that ""if you're from Syria and you're a Christian, you cannot come into this country"" as a refugee. This is wrong on its face -- a small number of Syrian Christians been admitted as refugees over the past nine months -- and also false in spirit, since there is nothing in the United States’ laws or regulations that discriminates against Christian refugees. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4582C0>],/factchecks/2015/jul/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-if-youre-syria-and-christianyou-/

Goodlatte says deportations from U.S. interior have fallen under Obama
","Rep. Bob Goodlatte scoffs at any suggestion that President Barack Obama has been tough on immigration. Amid news that a 32-year-old woman was allegedly murdered by a felon who had been deported repeatedly, Goodlatte said Obama has been soft on enforcing the country’s immigration laws. ""The actual deportations from the interior of the country are way down (under Obama),"" Goodlatte, R-6th, said in an interview on ABC News. Are deportations from the interior ""way down"" under Obama? We asked Goodlatte, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, for the source of his statement. We heard back from Jessica Collins, the deputy communication director for the House Judiciary Committee. She pointed us to a 2014 memo that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sent to the committee in response to questions about the federal agency’s figures on undocumented immigrants expelled from the U.S. The agency’s figures show that in 2008, the year before Obama took office, there were 244,091 removals of illegal immigrants from the interior of the U.S., which the agency defines as anywhere away from the ""immediate border"" where an immigrant is barred from trying to enter the country illegally. In 2009, there were 237,941 interior removals in the first year of Obama’s term. That dropped to 133,551 by year 2013. Those figures represent a broad group of deportations which include two main categories. One is ""removals,"" where someone is ordered out of the country by a formal court order and prohibited from coming back for a period of time. The other category is ""returns,"" where an immigrant voluntarily leaves the U.S., often in the absence of a formal order. That situation typically doesn’t carry harsh penalties if they return to the country. The immigration agency further broke down its figures for the House panel, excluding simple returns and focusing on formal removals. In 2008, there were 171,540 of those removals from the interior. That rose to 175,702 in Obama’s first year in office in 2009 before falling to 110,781 in 2013. In 2014, ICE said it conducted 102,224 removals. It’s not immediately clear from ICE’s latest report whether that 2014 figure includes only formal removals mandated by an order, or whether it includes removals and returns. But either way you look at the figures, interior deportations have fallen between 40 and 60 percent during Obama’s term. Four immigration policy analysts we talked to agreed that interior deportations dropped off under Obama. Marc Rosenblum, the deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, said those deportations really dropped off in recent years as a result of the Obama shifting enforcement away from immigrants who didn’t fall into certain groups flagged for high priority for deportation. The White House is focused on people apprehended at the border and on other priority targets such as immigrants charged with a various crimes or deemed to be a threat to public safety, Rosenblum said. ""While they’ve been scaling back interior removals, they’ve been increasing border removals,"" Rosenblum told us. A July report by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank founded by a group of Democratic and Republican senators, illustrated that switch. In 2008, about two-thirds of ICE’s 369,000 removals were from the interior, while the other third were from the border. That proportion started to change a couple of years ago and by 2014, about one-third of the agency’s 316,000 removals were from the interior while the other two-thirds were from the border. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote in a January blog post, that while interior removals have fallen in recent years under Obama, they remain high compared to former President George W. Bush. Looking at the last six years of the former president’s tenure, Nowrasteh said there were an average of 79,000 removed from the interior annually under Bush, compared with an average of 158,000 during the first six years of Obama’s term. But one problem in comparing the two administrations, Nowrasteh noted, is that there were a chunk of cases each year under Bush in which it was unclear from where in the U.S. an immigrant had been deported. Our ruling Goodlatte said deportations are ""way down"" under Obama. The figures he cites show a significant drop during Obama’s term, a trend confirmed by several by immigration analysts we interviewed. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973E1B00>],/factchecks/2015/jul/20/bob-goodlatte/goodlatte-says-deportations-us-interior-have-falle/

Trump: I called McCain a 'hero' four times
","Donald Trump is facing intense bipartisan backlash after saying Vietnam War prisoner of war Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is ""not a war hero,"" but an indignant Trump won’t apologize. Trump defended his latest provocation on ABC’s This Week, adding that McCain ""has done nothing to help veterans"" and suggesting the senator should actually apologize to him for insulting Trump supporters. When pressed by host Martha Raddatz, Trump complained that his critics are taking his comments out of context. ""Four times, I said he is a hero,"" he said on July 19, citing a fact-check by journalist Sharyl Attkisson. ""But you know … people choose little selective pieces. If you read what I say or watch what I say, which is even better, you’ll say that there was nothing wrong."" We took Trump’s advice and put his statement in context. The backstory The McCain-Trump war of words started in a New Yorker article published July 16. Ryan Lizza asked McCain about Trump and his anti-immigration rally held last weekend in McCain’s home state. McCain, as the article notes, led efforts to push through comprehensive immigration reform and ""has been at war with the far right in Arizona for years."" ""This performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me,"" McCain told Lizza, ""Because what he did was he fired up the crazies.""   Trump couldn’t take this lying down and retaliated on Twitter:  (For the record, McCain graduated 894th out of a class of 899.) When Trump attended a rally in Ames, Iowa, on July 18, Republican pollster Frank Luntz asked him if calling McCain ""a dummy"" was appropriate. Trump recounted his beef with McCain before questioning his status as war hero in a back and forth with Luntz. Here’s a transcript of their conversation: Trump: ""(McCain) insulted me and he insulted everybody in that room. And I said somebody should run against John McCain, who has been, in my opinion, not so hot. And I supported him for president. I raised $1 million for him. That’s a lot of money. I supported him, he lost, he let us down. But he lost and I never liked him much after that 'cause I don’t like losers. But, but — Frank, Frank, let me get to it. Luntz: ""He’s a war hero. He’s a war hero …"" Trump: ""He’s not a war hero ..."" Luntz: ""He’s war hero."" Trump: ""He is a war hero ..."" Luntz: ""Five and half years in a Vietnamese prison camp …"" Trump: ""He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured. So he’s a war hero …"" Luntz: ""Do you agree with that?"" Trump: ""He’s a war hero, because he was captured, okay? I believe, perhaps, he’s a war hero. But right now he said some very bad things about a lot of people. So what I said is John McCain, I disagree with him that these people aren’t crazy."" Trump literally said McCain ""is a war hero"" five times, but always with strings attached. Twice, he was interrupted by Luntz before he could finish his sentence. Once, the statement was preceded by ""I believe, perhaps."" And the last two times, Trump added ""because he was captured."" He also, of course, started all this by saying McCain is ""not a war hero."" Experts told us these caveats change the meaning of the sentence entirely. "" ‘He’s a war hero because he was captured’ implies that anybody who is captured is called a war hero, but there’s really nothing special about them,"" said Kathleen Kendall, who studies political campaign communication at the University of Maryland. McCain, whose war record has been the subject of false attacks before, was taken prisoner by the Vietcong when his plane was shot down in 1967. For five and a half years, he was tortured and held in solitary confinement amid attempts by the North Vietnamese to obtain information and false confessions, according to the Navy. As the son of an admiral, McCain was offered an early release but refused until POWs who had been at the camp for longer than him were let go. We’re not remarking on whether captivity is a marker of heroism, but Trump likely wasn’t either,  says rhetoric scholar Paul Achter of the University of Richmond. ""(Trump) appears to have thought it would be a funny aside to the question he was answering,"" he said. In short, Trump’s self-defense is flimsy at best. As for his accusation of critics cherry-picking his comments, experts say the pot is calling the kettle black. ""He’s taking his own words out of context. That’s the offense he’s charging the media with,"" Kendall said. We reached out to the Trump campaign for a response but didn’t hear back. Our ruling Trump said, ""Four times, I said (McCain) is a hero but you know … people choose selective pieces."" Trump literally said McCain is a hero five times, but never without caveats. Once, he added ""perhaps, I believe"" before conceding the point. Twice, he was interrupted. And the last two times, Trump said, ""He is a war hero because he was captured."" In other words, Trump also chose ""selective pieces"" and misquoted himself.

Marco Rubio says Iran deal breaks 'anytime, anywhere' inspection promise by Barack Obama
","The agreement reached with Iran over nuclear weapons remained a top issue on the Sunday July 19 news shows, with critics of the deal urging that it be scuttled by Congress. On CNN’s State of the Union, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told host Jake Tapper that ""this deal violates promises the president made to the American people on multiple fronts. It is not an anytime, anywhere inspection process."" This issue also came up on the same day on CBS’s Face the Nation, when Secretary of State John Kerry said of anytime, anywhere inspections, ""This is a term that, honestly, I never heard in the four years that we were negotiating. It was not on the table. There's no such thing in arms control as ‘anytime, anywhere.’ There isn't any nation in the world, none that has an anytime, anywhere. We always were negotiating was an end to the interminable delays that people had previously. "" On Rubio’s claim, we see two questions. First, does the Iran deal fall short of an ""anytime, anywhere inspection process""? And second, did Obama promise that it would include an inspection regime that strict? Does the Iran deal fall short of an ‘anytime, anywhere inspection process’? We addressed this question in the course of checking a recent claim by Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., that ""thanks to the Obama administration’s negotiations, Iran’s nuclear program will be under lock, key and camera 24 hours a day, 365 days a year."" We found that it’s correct that certain specific Iranian assets that will be under 24/7 monitoring by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA. According to the agreement, ""for 15 years, Iran will permit the IAEA to implement continuous monitoring, including through containment and surveillance measures, as necessary, to verify that stored centrifuges and infrastructure remain in storage, and are only used to replace failed or damaged centrifuges."" This round-the-clock monitoring will explicitly include ""electronic seals which communicate their status within nuclear sites to IAEA inspectors, as well as other IAEA approved and certified modern technologies,"" according to the agreement. For instance, at an Iranian facility like Natanz, where more than 5,000 centrifuges will be operating, the IAEA will have cameras that provide 24-hour monitoring, said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear specialist at the Harvard Kennedy School. In addition, the agreement says, ""Iran will permit the IAEA regular access, including daily access as requested by the IAEA, to relevant buildings at (the Iranian nuclear facility at) Natanz ... for 15 years."" However, this sort of 24/7 surveillance will not be the rule everywhere in the Iranian nuclear archipelago. ""At most locations, inspections will be every once in a while, on a schedule the inspectors judge to be sufficient based on the sensitivity of the activities at that location, how long it would take for Iran to do something there that would make a difference, and so on,"" Bunn said.    In fact, even if Iran ultimately agrees to a contentious inspection, the wait could be as long as 24 days. The agreement spells out that if the IAEA and Iran can’t work out their differences over suspicions about undeclared nuclear materials or activities within 14 days, a joint commission empowered by the agreement would try to resolve the situation for another seven days. Once the commission decides what to do, Iran would have three more days to follow through. In other words, when looking at Iran’s nuclear complex as a whole, ""the IAEA can’t just drive up with no warning — it’s not ‘anytime, anywhere,’ "" Bunn said So on this point, Rubio is justified in suggesting that the deal doesn’t include ""anytime, anywhere"" inspections. Did Obama promise that the agreement with Iran would include an ‘anytime, anywhere’ inspection regime? This question is a bit more complicated. We located at least one, and possibly two, instances in which Ben Rhodes -- an assistant to the president and deputy national security advisor for strategic communications and speechwriting -- said the deal would include ""anytime, anywhere"" inspections. One of Rhodes’ comments came in an interview with Tapper on April 6, 2015. Tapper asked Rhodes, ""So the Israelis have put out this list of things that they think should be in the final deal with Iran, including allowing inspectors to go anywhere, anytime. That seems perfectly reasonable, no?"" Rhodes responded, ""Well, Jake, first of all, under this deal, you will have anywhere, anytime 24/7 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that Iran has."" The second of Rhodes’ comments came on the same day, in an interview with Israel's Channel 10, April 6, 2015. After objecting to the paraphrases used in a widely cited Times of Israel article about the interview, the White House sent us a transcript of the exchange. Rhodes was asked, ""Will the IAEA have the ability to visit anywhere, anytime?"" Rhodes responded, ""Yes, if we see something we want to inspect. So in the first case we will have ‘anytime anywhere’ access to all of the nuclear facilities. We’ll have the ability to look across all of their supply chain, their uranium mines and mills, their centrifuge production and storage facilities. But I think what you're mainly referring to is if there's a suspicious site, for instance, on a military base in Iran, and we want to seek access to that we will be able to go to the IAEA, and get that inspection because of the additional protocol of the IAEA that Iran will be joining, and some of the additional transparency and inspection measures that are in the deal."" Much of the coverage has focused on Rhodes’ agreement with the interviewer’s words that the IAEA will ""have the ability to visit anywhere, anytime."" The White House notes, however, that Rhodes’ full comments are more nuanced, spelling out the more complicated -- and not instantaneous -- process of inspecting suspicious sites not already cited in the agreement. So we see one pretty clear statement, plus one somewhat less clear statement, made by the Obama administration that backs up Rubio’s claim. ""The answer given by Ben Rhodes is consistent with the messaging that the Obama administration has been providing since the nuclear talks with Iran began,"" said Rick Brennan Jr., a senior political scientist with Rand Corp. ""In fact, in 2012 President Obama declared that the final deal with Iran would ensure ‘the end to their nuclear program,’ which we now understand is not accurate."" That said, though, Rhodes' comments are something of an outlier to the words other White House officials have said. In general, the message from senior White House officials has been that the inspections regime in the deal would be strong by historical standards -- and strong enough to achieve its goals --  but not allowing ""anytime, anywhere"" inspections. Critics like Rubio ""are trying to imply that the Obama administration promised that international inspectors bust into any undeclared Iranian site, whenever they felt like doing so, and without cause,"" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. However, that was not the administration’s goal, because ""no sovereign state would agree to such an arrangement; no such access is necessary to verify compliance; and any such arrangement would waste the inspectors' resources. Iran is a large country and the inspectors should and will focus on particular areas/sites of concern."" A good example of the White House's usual wording is the briefing held by Press Secretary Josh Earnest on March 9, 2015. Here are some of the phrases Earnest used to describe the extent of the inspection regime: • ""We're going to insist that the Iranians agree to intrusive inspection measures that will resolve the broader international community’s concerns."" • ""What we are seeking from Iran are a whole set of commitments from them … to comply with an intrusive set of inspections to verify their compliance with the agreement."" • ""They’re going to have to agree to a set of very intrusive inspections."" • ""Any sort of agreement that is reached will require serious commitments on the part of Iran to an intrusive inspections program that allows international inspectors not just into their nuclear facilities, but also into the manufacturing facilities that are manufacturing parts and equipment for their nuclear facilities that would require inspections at uranium mines in Iran."" • ""We would insist … that Iran commit to comply with a historically intrusive set of inspections."" • The deal would ""impose an intrusive set of inspections that would verify Iran’s compliance with the agreement."" Such language has been echoed numerous other times by White House officials, including Obama. In a Rose Garden address on April 2, 2015, four days before Rhodes’ televised comments, Obama said: ""Iran will face strict limitations on its program, and Iran has also agreed to the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear program in history. … International inspectors will have unprecedented access not only to Iranian nuclear facilities, but to the entire supply chain that supports Iran’s nuclear program -- from uranium mills that provide the raw materials, to the centrifuge production and storage facilities that support the program."" Obama repeated the sentiment in his weekly address on April 4, 2015, and the message was echoed by others -- including Rhodes himself. At a press briefing at Camp David May 14, 2015, Rhodes said, ""Under this agreement that we're pursuing with the Iranians, (the nuclear) program will be rolled back and face significant limitations that it doesn’t currently face, and there will be the most intrusive inspections regime of any arms control agreement that we've ever had."" Rhodes tried to clarify the ""anywhere, anytime"" phrasing in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett on July 14, 2015. ""We never sought in this negotiation the capacity for so-called ‘anytime, anywhere’ where you can basically go anywhere in the country, look at whatever you wanted to do, even if it had nothing to do with the nuclear program. What we did seek is beyond this comprehensive verification of the nuclear sites. If we have a suspicion about a site, we have the ability to go to the IAEA, the organization that conducts inspections, and to say, we need to inspect that site."" So Rubio’s not wrong to say that the Obama administration promised ""anywhere, anytime"" inspections. However, it’s also reasonable to point out that most of the administration’s statements on this point have not used that specific language. Our ruling Rubio said that the Iran nuclear deal ""violates promises the president made to the American people"" because it ""is not an anytime, anywhere inspection process."" Rubio has a point that a senior administration national-security official did, in at least one case and possibly two cases, say on television that the deal would include ""anytime, anywhere"" inspection provisions. However, focusing on these two comments is a bit of cherry-picking, since most of the White House’s statements on this issue have avoided that term in favor of ones that can be more plausibly used to describe the provisions of the agreement that were ultimately reached. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973F9940>],/factchecks/2015/jul/19/marco-rubio/rubio-iran-deal-breaks-anytime-anywhere-inspection/
"['Rhode Island', 'Infrastructure', 'Transportation', 'Gina Raimondo']","
Raimondo says heavy trucks cause over 90 percent of the damage to our bridges and highways. Really?
","The state’s bridges and highways need repair and part of Governor Raimondo’s proposed solution is to make the owners of big trucks pay the tab for bridge projects. On May 27, Raimondo announced that she hoped to raise $700 million for the ""RhodeWorks"" program by establishing tolls specifically for certain trucks. ""Eighteen wheelers and above"" was how she put it. Why was Rhode Island’s governor so focused on those types of trucks? ""It’s commercial vehicles 18 wheelers and above and the fact of the matter is, those are the trucks that cause 90 plus percent of the damages on our highways and bridges. They're also the ones that benefit the most from high quality well-maintained roads,"" Raimondo said. Senate President M. Teresa Paiva Weed echoed Raimondo’s statement, saying the toll proposal would focus the ""burden of bridge maintenance squarely and fairly on the large commercial trucks.""   That seemed like a lot of damage to pin on a small number of vehicles,18 wheelers and above. PolitiFact went to Marie Aberger, the governor’s spokeswoman, for an explanation. It turns out the governor had misspoken during her news conference that day under the rusting connector for Route 6 and Route 10. Soon after the governor made the statement, Aberger clarified it for reporters, telling them that the toll proposal wasn’t just for 18 wheelers and above. It was for large commercial trucks including 18 wheelers. At the time, Aberger also distributed a PowerPoint presentation that identified trucks subject to the toll — and ostensibly responsible for the damage. That group of vehicles included all tractor trailers, including some with more than 18 wheels as well as some big trucks with three or more axles, such as certain types of dump trucks. And what’s the evidence that this broader group of trucks causes 90 plus percent of damage to roads and bridges? The answer is complicated, but for decades, engineers have agreed that heavy trucks cause far more damage than other lighter vehicles. The damage caused by a single heavy truck can be 9,600 times the damage caused by a single car, according to a U.S. General Accounting Office report cited by the governor’s office. Finally, six separate damage calculations given to PolitiFact by the administration show, in all but one case, that the damage caused by heavy trucks appears to exceed 90 percent of all vehicle-related damage. But what about ice and salt, snow and flooding? Or maintenance? Or the age of the highway? The governor didn’t say anything about other important factors — including weather damage, leaving the impression that those 18-wheelers were almost entirely to blame. On that point, Aberger said that the administration’s damage calculations were only for damage caused by vehicles. That, she said, was the governor’s focus when she said heavy trucks were responsible for ""for 90 plus percent of the damages on our highways and bridges.""  A spokesman at the Department of Transportation had a similar explanation. Interestingly, the GAO report that the administration cited prominently as a source for its calculations on vehicle-related road and bridge damage lists weather as one of four principal factors in the deterioration of roads and bridges. ""There are several reasons why highways deteriorate,"" says the report. ""Principal among these are weather, deferred maintenance, highway age, and increased traffic."" Our ruling Raimondo’s claim  that ""18 wheelers and above cause 90 plus percent of the damages to our highways and bridges"" was quickly corrected by her spokeswoman. Fine. But neither Raimondo nor the state’s PowerPoint discussed damage from weather — or from deferred maintenance for that matter —  leaving the impression that those heavy trucks were the only problem.   For those reasons, we rate her statement, Half True.   (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)",[<zip object at 0x0000028097897D40>],/factchecks/2015/jul/19/gina-raimondo/raimondo-says-heavy-trucks-cause-over-90-percent-d/

Israeli ambassador uses odd logic to relate Iran's frozen assets to the U.S. treasury
","While President Barack Obama has hammered the point that the sole goal of the nuclear accord with Iran was to prevent it from building a bomb, many of America’s allies in the region are at least as concerned about a more immediate threat. They fear that an economic revival in Iran would allow it to build its military and boost its funding of proxy fighters who oppose Israel and key Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia. Israel’s ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, raised that issue July 13, 2015, at a major gathering in Washington of Christians United for Israel, an evangelical group. ""That deal will not bring peace closer. It will bring war closer — making conventional war more likely today and the horrors of nuclear terrorism more likely tomorrow,"" Dermer said. He posted the speech on his Facebook page. A short bit later, Dermer talked about the impact of unfreezing Iranian assets. ""The promise of phased sanctions relief looks more like a one-time jackpot for the Ayatollah regime,"" he said. ""In a few months, this deal would give Iran $150 billion. Iran has a $300 (billion) to $400 billion economy. A $150 billion infusion of cash into Iran’s coffers is like $8 trillion flowing into the United States treasury."" Dermer did not say where he got his numbers or elaborate on his analogy. We asked the Embassy of Israel in Washington to clarify Dermer’s statement but did not hear back. Absent hearing from the source, we assume that the underlying math runs as follows: $150 billion is half of $300 billion (the low end of Dermer’s estimate of Iran’s GDP). The U.S. economy is over $16 trillion ($18.1 billion in 2015), so half of that gives you the $8 trillion Dermer cited. The reality of the deal's effect is much more complicated than Dermer's math lets on. And though there are issues with his numbers, the fundamental flaw is his logic. He treats GDP, which is the sum of all goods and services generated by a nation’s economy, as if it were the same as the government’s bank account. This is sort of like saying your yearly income is the same as your checking account. Most Americans would like that to be true, but it isn’t. The two are completely different, and so are GDP and national treasuries. So even though it would be fair to note that Iran’s state-owned oil company accounts for a huge chunk of the country’s economy, Iran's access to that money is not like the U.S. treasury getting an infusion of $8 trillion. A government and its economy are not one and the same. Dermer would have been on slightly firmer ground if he had said unfreezing Iran's assets would be like injecting $8 trillion into Iran's economy. But he didn't, and the analytic issues don't stop there. There’s also a problem with the numbers Dermer used. There are different ways to estimate Iran’s GDP, but according to the World Bank, Iran’s economy is $415 billion. If we re-do Dermer’s math, that would mean the equivalent impact in the United States — regardless of Dermer’s troubled metaphor — would be about 30 percent lower than he said. It’s also likely that Dermer inflated the size of Iran’s assets that were frozen under sanctions. The U.S. Treasury Department estimates the value of Iran’s foreign currency reserves at $100 billion. An article in Foreign Policy magazine cited $120 billion. We don’t know where Dermer got $150 billion. The Institute of International Finance, a trade association representing banks, insurance companies and other financial entities worldwide, ran its own numbers and settled on $100 billion. Garbis Iradian is the association’s chief economist for Africa and the Middle East. Iradian told us that the money in those overseas accounts does belong to the government of Iran and about two-thirds of it comes from oil sales. Sanctions imposed in 2012 forbid the repatriation of those dollars to Iran. If the deal goes into effect, there will be a delay of at least a few months before Iran’s accounts are unfrozen. First, the International Atomic Energy Agency must certify that Iran is doing what it promised. That certification is being called ""Implementation Day,"" and when that happens, Iran will gain access to its foreign reserves. Does that mean that all of the money will go back to Iran in a great rush? No one knows for sure. Michael Malloy is a law professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento and the author of The Structure of Economic Sanctions to be published next spring by Cambridge University Press. Malloy said the funds smooth the process when Iran needs to buy things on the international market. The hard currency is in place to transfer to the foreign seller. ""The Iranians will need those facilities,"" Malloy said. ""Those account relationships will continue and a lot of that money will stay."" Iradian said that in theory, Iran could decide to bring all the money home, but he too suspects that is unlikely. While Tehran might tap $10 billion or even $20 billion, Iradian said the money is a hedge against shifts in the international market, especially the price of oil. (A quick term of art: A country’s current account is the balance between money going out for imports, and the money coming in from exports.) ""If oil prices drop below $50 a barrel, then the current account of the country will be negative,"" Iradian said. ""How will they finance the gap? They will tap their official reserves."" Iradian described the Iranian central bank managers as prudent. ""The official reserve is a fall back position,"" he said. ""It’s like you keeping money in your checking account in case you lose your job. For Iran, it has security for whenever it has difficulty meeting its foreign exchange needs."" Iradian has written that the lifting of sanctions, of which unfreezing Iranian bank accounts is a part, will provide a major boost to the Iranian economy. Again, the effects on the economy are different from the money in Iran's treasury. Our ruling Dermer said that for an economy the size of Iran, unfreezing $150 billion of Iranian assets would be like pumping $8 trillion into the U.S. treasury. There are several problems with this claim. It exaggerates the value of Iran’s frozen assets, underestimates the size of the Iranian economy, and confuses the concepts of a country’s economy and the money in its treasury. While Iran would gain access to foreign currency reserves worth about $100 billion, it is far from certain that the money would go directly into government spending. On the other hand, an amount of money on that scale would have a significant impact on the nation’s finances. The numbers are off and the logic is flawed, but this statement has an element of accuracy. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097006080>],/factchecks/2015/jul/17/ron-dermer/israeli-ambassador-uses-odd-logic-relate-irans-fro/

Glenn Hegar says Texas owns its public lands; Uncle Sam must ask permission to open a park there
","Before Independence Day, a Texas leader said the federal government needs permission to plant a park in the state. Glenn Hegar, the state comptroller, said in a June 24, 2015, tweet: ""Texas still owns all of its public lands. If the federal gov't wants to create a park, they must ask permission!"" Two national parks are in West Texas and the Padre Island National Seashore is on South Padre Island. Also in Texas at the time Hegar tweeted, the U.S. National Park Service listed a national preserve, a national monument, two national historical trails, two national recreation areas, three national historical parks, a national monument, a national memorial, a national preserve and a designated wild and scenic river in the state (all there before another monument, the Waco Mammoth Site, was announced after Hegar exclaimed). We noticed too that a park service web page displays the remarkably brief American Antiquities Act of 1906, signed into law by Theodore Roosevelt. That law authorizes a president to declare national monuments on lands owned or controlled by the federal government. The act states that ""when such objects are situated upon a tract covered by a bona fide unperfected claim or held in private ownership, the tract, or so much thereof as may be necessary for the proper care and management of the object, may be relinquished to the Government, and the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized to accept the relinquishment of such tracts in behalf of the Government of the United States."" So land can be given up for a park or such, per the act. But there’s nothing about seeking permission from a state. Hegar’s statement also intrigued us because of how little land the federal government owns in Texas. In August 2014, an advocate with the Colorado-based Center for Western Priorities pointed us toward a Nov. 14, 2008, Heritage Foundation map of the U.S., drawing on federal data, showing Uncle Sam owns 2 percent of the land in Texas but far more land in western states that as a condition of joining the union had agreed to give up any stake in otherwise unclaimed lands in their respective boundaries.  Hegar’s backup To our inquiry about Hegar's tweet, Liz White of his campaign operation said Hegar reached his conclusion starting from a Random Facts website that included this entry: ""Texas still owns all of its public lands. If the federal government wants to create a park or cut a stand of timber, it must first ask the state’s permission."" On the site, a footnote attributed the ""permission"" statement to a 2003 book, ""Texas: Facts and Symbols,"" which we found in the children’s section of a branch of the Austin Public Library. The 24-page book presents various facts (as in: Texas got its name from the Caddo word tejas [TAY-hawss]). But it lacks mention of Texas owning its public lands or the federal government needing the state’s permission to create a park. In her email to us, White suggested Hegar’s statement also was supported by a report by the Texas General Land Office, an agency that's been around since before Texas’s statehood; it lately oversees more than 13 million acres of land generating money for Texas public schools. The cited report, last updated in January 2015, states that before statehood, Texas in 1844: ""submitted a treaty of annexation to the United States Congress. Under its terms, Texas would have given 175,000,000 acres of public land to the United States government and the United States would have assumed Texas's debts of $10,000,000. The United States Congress rejected the treaty on grounds that the Texas public domain was not worth $10,000,000. When Texas was annexed to the United States in 1845 by a joint resolution of Congress, Texas retained both its debts and its public land. Texas was the only state, other than the original 13 colonies, to enter the Union with control over its public land… Today, over 22.5 million acres of land remain in the Texas public domain."" So Texas kept its public lands at statehood. White also pointed out a federal park service web page on the Big Bend park, which she described as demonstrating the federal government asked permission from the state to acquire land for a park. The cited passage: ""In the 1930's many people who loved the Big Bend country saw that it was a land of unique contrast and beauty that was worth preserving for future generations. The State of Texas passed legislation to acquire land in the area which was to become the Texas Canyons State Park. In 1935, the Federal Government passed legislation that would enable the acquisition of the land for a national park. The State of Texas deeded the land that they had acquired to the Federal government, and on June 12, 1944, Big Bend National Park became a reality."" That didn’t seem like an explicit mention of permission being sought. In the spirit of that excerpt, we looked briefly into how the pair of other major national parks came to be in Texas. A Texas State Historical Association web page says the Guadalupe Mountains park came about after a family in the 1930s offered to donate 300 acres of scenic McKittrick Canyon to the state of Texas. ""By the 1960s, land donations and sales to the National Park Service paved the way for the establishment of a national park"" in 1972, the web page says. And U.S. Sen. Ralph Yarborough initiated legislation to create the Padre Island National Seashore in 1957, a park service timeline indicates. Another agency web page says President Kennedy signed the park measure into law in 1962. Land was acquired from 1962 through 1969 and the park opened in 1970, the timeline says. Land commissioners divide Bumfuzzled about the ""permission"" part of Hegar’s tweet, we asked aides to the current land commissioner, George P. Bush, and a couple of his predecessors for guidance. Agency spokeswoman Brittany Eck said by email that if the federal government wanted to convert state-owned lands to a federal park, any sale would have to be approved by state lawmakers. By phone, two former land commissioners, Republican Jerry Patterson and Democrat Garry Mauro, separately gave contradictory answers. Patterson said that given that the federal government doesn’t already own a lot of Texas land convertible to parks, ""they'd have to get it. They’d have to buy the land,"" he said, ""which implies"" getting permission. Mauro said the federal government doesn’t need permission from Texas to create a park. ""That’s just a fact,"" Mauro said. ""The federal government can condemn what it wants to condemn."" Historian for park service We also reached out to Robert Sutton, chief historian of the National Park Service, who said by phone it was news to him that the federal government had to ask permission to open a park in Texas. By email, Sutton subsequently said he checked the March 1845 congressional resolution setting terms for Texas joining the union, which says Texas is to keep its public lands but doesn’t say anything about the federal government needing to ask permission to use Texas-owned land, Sutton noted, for any purpose. ""So, and I'm certainly not a constitutional lawyer, but I would say that the claim that the feds need to ask for permission is incorrect,"" Sutton wrote. We shared Sutton’s take with Lauren Willis, spokeswoman for Hegar’s state office. By email, Willis said it struck her as ""one historian’s opinion."" Our ruling Hegar tweeted: ""Texas still owns all of its public lands. If the federal gov't wants to create a park, they must ask permission!"" The first part of Hegar’s statement is obvious: Texas owns its 22.5 million acres of public land, with the federal government owning less than 2 percent of Texas acreage, much of it in the Big Bend National Park. It also stands to reason the federal government wouldn’t open a park in the state without interacting with state officials, perhaps seeking a land deal. However, Hegar didn’t provide, nor did we turn up, evidence that the feds must ask permission to open a park in Texas. Hegar’s statement comes out half-obvious, half-unsupported--and Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

"['Nuclear', 'PunditFact', 'Dick Cheney']","
Cheney: Obama wants to get 'rid of all nuclear weapons,' has reduced U.S. capability 'significantly'
","Fox News host Sean Hannity found a partner in outrage over the Iran nuclear deal in former Vice President Dick Cheney. On July 14, the pair blasted the White House’s agreement (full text) as a betrayal of Israel, saying the agreement had loose restrictions on Iran that will endanger the world. At one point, Hannity asked Cheney if he thought the deal would incentivize other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, to move forward with their own nuclear programs. Cheney said he would be surprised if they didn’t because they will feel ""they have no choice."" The United States under President Barack Obama is no longer an ally they can trust, he said. ""For one thing, we haven’t kept our word to them in the past,"" Cheney said. ""Secondly, we’re dramatically reducing our own capabilities. Obama keeps talking about getting rid of all nuclear weapons. He’s already significantly reduced our capabilities there. This last week, he announced a 40,000-man reduction in the United States Army. He’s not a man of his word."" When we looked into Cheney’s characterization of the U.S. nuclear program under Obama, experts called it ""ridiculous"" and said that Cheney neglected important caveats Obama gave in talking about his dream for a world free of nuclear weapons. (PunditFact tried to reach Cheney through his speaker’s bureau, but he did not respond to our inquiry.) Here’s what’s missing from Cheney’s claim that Obama ""keeps talking about getting rid of all nuclear weapons"" and is ""significantly"" reducing the country’s nuclear capabilities. ‘A world without nuclear weapons’ Obama entered the White House in 2009 having made a slew of campaign promises about reducing the nuclear arsenal of the United States and the world. (Several of these promises have been monitored by PolitiFact.) The Norwegian Nobel Committee highlighted his ""vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons"" in awarding Obama the 2009 Peace Prize. The award followed Obama’s major speech on how he would address nuclear weapons in Prague on April 5, 2009. The new president said the United States had a moral responsibility to act on reducing the threat of nuclear weapons in the 21st century as the only country to have used nuclear weapons. Obama said: ""So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons."" Bingo for Cheney? Not necessarily. There was more. ""I'm not naive. This goal will not be reached quickly –- perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, ‘Yes, we can.’ Now, let me describe to you the trajectory we need to be on. First, the United States will take concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons. To put an end to Cold War thinking, we will reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy, and urge others to do the same. Make no mistake: As long as these weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deter any adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies –- including the Czech Republic. But we will begin the work of reducing our arsenal."" Obama reinforced his dream in a 2012 speech in Seoul and a 2013 address in Berlin. In the latter speech, he told the crowd: ""Peace with justice means pursuing the security of a world without nuclear weapons — no matter how distant that dream may be. And so, as President, I’ve strengthened our efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and reduced the number and role of America’s nuclear weapons. Because of the New START Treaty, we’re on track to cut American and Russian deployed nuclear warheads to their lowest levels since the 1950s."" So Obama had a dream, but it’s one that he couched with a significant caveat. Cheney has a point that a world without nukes is Obama’s end-goal, a position that some conservatives say isn’t realistic because the weapons cannot be uninvented. On the other hand, the United States will not be first to eliminate its arsenal, Obama pledged. Experts told PunditFact this is not a new vision among U.S. presidents. ""The goal of working for the elimination of nuclear weapons has been U.S. policy since the Kennedy administration,"" said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. ""Obama didn’t invent it."" At the 2009 United Nations Security Council Summit about nuclear disarmament, Obama quoted Ronald Reagan, who said, ""We must never stop at all until we see the day when nuclear arms have been banished from the face of the Earth."" While Obama did not reiterate this vision in a White House address or press conference about the Iranian nuclear deal, he did bring it up again on page 11 of his national security strategy paper released February 2015. ‘Significantly reduced’ nuclear capability? Cheney’s second point — that the country’s nuclear weapons arsenal has been ""significantly reduced"" under Obama — drew more scorn from the experts. ""It is clearly incorrect to say that President Obama has reduced the U.S. nuclear weapons capability,"" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, which supports reducing American and Russian nuclear stockpiles. ""We’d like for him to be doing more, and we’re disappointed that he’s not."" In fact, the United States will spend hundreds of billions in the next 10 years to modernize its aging strategic nuclear force, which consists of submarines that launch ballistic missiles, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, and long-range bombers. Nuclear warheads will also be refurbished, and new and improved facilities around the country will be constructed. In all, the United States will spend about $35 billion a year on these improvements, or $350 billion through 2025, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The current nuclear force is comprised of about 1,550 long-range warheads. As the upgrades began, many supporters of disarmament grew confused about Obama’s shift in nuclear priorities. The New York Times quoted Sam Nunn, a former senator who influenced Obama’s view on nuclear nonproliferation, in September 2014 as saying Obama’s ""vision was a significant change in direction. But the process has preserved the status quo."" According to Kristensen’s 2014 analysis, Obama has cut the number of nuclear weapons by a smaller percentage than any American president since the end of the Cold War. Obama’s 10 percent reduction over six years trails even George W. Bush’s 50 percent, according to Kristensen. Under the New START Treaty with Russia -- an arms control agreement that was approved in bipartisan fashion by the then-Democratic-led Congress in December 2010 -- the Obama administration has reduced the number of deployed warheads and launchers slightly. Under the treaty, neither country is allowed to possess more than 1,550 nuclear warheads and 700 intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments.  ""Those are modest reductions that in no way are ‘dramatically reducing our own capabilities,’ "" Kristensen said, adding that the policies Obama is pursuing on nuclear weapons have been approved by the United States Strategic Command and the Pentagon. Our ruling Cheney said, ""Obama keeps talking about getting rid of all nuclear weapons. He’s already significantly reduced our capabilities there."" Since campaigning for office, Obama has frequently mentioned that, in an ideal world, there would be no nuclear weapons. However, Cheney ignores that Obama has consistently acknowledged that this dream may not be achievable in his lifetime, and that the United States won’t give up its nuclear weapon arsenal as long as its enemies possess them. Experts also said Cheney overstates the arms reductions occurring during Obama’s presidency. Reductions are happening under a 2010 treaty with Russia, but the United States is also spending billions on modernizing its arsenal, and it is taking fewer weapons out of service than under any previous president in the post-Cold War age. Cheney’s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097713E40>],/factchecks/2015/jul/17/dick-cheney/cheney-obama-wants-get-rid-all-nuclear-weapons-has/

Jim Carrey misfires on vaccine claim
","Georgia has the CDC in its backyard to talk up the importance of childhood immunizations, but the anti-vaccine movement gained some high-profile supporters in California with a new law there that requires all public school children receive vaccinations. Actors Selma Blair and Kirstie Alley blasted the law, which starting next year will no longer allow immunization exemptions based on a religious convictions or ""personal belief"" that vaccines might be harmful. (Exemptions remain for medical reasons and kids being homeschooled). Actor Jim Carrey was the most prolific of all in his attacks, unleashing a series of Tweets that called the CDC ""corrupt"" in the vaccine debate and blasted California Gov. Jerry Brown a ""corporate fascist"" for signing the bill into law. ""California Gov says yes to poisoning more children with mercury and aluminum in manditory [sic] vaccines,"" Carrey posted on Twitter on June 30. Carrey, who dated anti-vaccine crusader and former Playmate and TV host Jenny McCarthy, continued his barrage on social media through Tuesday, several times to insist he was ""pro-vaccine"" but ""anti-neurotoxin."" The myth that ""mercury"" causes autism ranks up with the flat-earth as among the most debunked scientific theories in history. PolitiFact Georgia walked through that false debate earlier this year, ruling it a ridiculous Pants on Fire! But aluminum as a poison? We reached out to Carrey and his representatives several times, but never heard back about his source or explanation. The actor’s Twitter feed cites a book edited by environmental attorney Robert F. Kennedy Jr., that continues to posit the thimerosal-autism link, but it makes no mention of the aluminum claim. So, we brushed off chemical books – well, looked at some scientific encyclopedias online – to see if we could sort that part out. Aluminum in vaccines Aluminum is literally everywhere. It is the third most abundant element on earth and the single most abundant element in the earth’s crust. It sits on the Periodic Table of Elements with ""other metals."" But unlike boron, needed in trace amounts in humans, and Thallium, a highly toxic element, aluminum has no known biological function nor significant toxicity. As such, its function in vaccines is far different than thimerosal, or ethyl mercury. Thimerosal was added to multi-dose vaccines (but not live shots, such as the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella) to act as a preservative against bacterial infections. It could be removed by simply making vaccines single-vial doses, said Dr. Walter A. Orenstein, a professor of medicine and pediatrics at Emory University and the associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center. Aluminum salts or gels are added to vaccines as ""adjuvants,"" enhancers that boost the immune system response of the shot. A 2011 report by two Canadian researchers raises questions about whether that boost is worth the potential risk. Dr. Lucija Tomljenovic and Dr. Christopher Shaw raise the possibility of overexposure to aluminum as potentially toxic and a cause of autoimmune disorders. ""The widespread presence in the human environment may underlie a number of (central nervous system) disorders,"" their paper concludes. ""The continued use of aluminum adjuvants in various vaccines for children, as well as the general public, may be of significant concern."" It’s worth noting, though, that the paper is a theory, not a scientific study. Several scientific websites have debunked the conclusions, citing decades of research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Food and Drug Administration that show aluminum is safe, and necessary. ""Aluminum is an essential component in boosting the immune responses,"" Orenstein said. ""We have no scientific evidence there is damage. We do have scientific evidence that there are bad diseases that aluminum in vaccines can prevent: cancer with the Human Papillomavirus vaccine, Diphtheria with the DTaP vaccine, and so on."" Toxicity? That said, there is such a thing as aluminum toxicity. Medical research shows it tends to occur in patients with significant kidney damage, or limited kidney function, who are also fed intravenously. In other words, there must be a specific spike in aluminum exposure – from the IV feeding – with simultaneous damage to one of the body’s essential trash collectors.  That makes aluminum toxicity exceedingly rare – even as immunization rates have increased over time, said Dr. Paul Offit, a professor of pediatrics in the infectious  diseases division at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Meanwhile, the CDC reports more than 2,200 alcohol poisoning deaths in the U.S. each year – an average of 6 such deaths every day. And water intoxication – a rare instance of overhydration that throws off the body’s sodium levels – killed a 10-week old Gwinnett County baby earlier this year. The key? To paraphrase the founder of toxicology, Paracelsus, the dose makes the poison. When it comes to aluminum, the FDA has concluded that a year-old baby given vaccines according to the recommended schedule will receive about 4.225 mg of the element over the course of a year. But remember that aluminum is in just about everything on earth, and the body can process it. A breast-fed child will typically ingest about  7 mg of aluminum in its first year, Offit said. For formula fed, it’s 38 mg. Soy formula, 117 milligrams. ""It’s the most abundant metal on earth’s crust, so if you live on the earth’s crust, which everyone with the possible exception of Jim Carrey does, you are exposed to aluminum,"" Offit said. Ouch. But given the miniscule amounts of aluminum in question in vaccines, Offit raises the critical point about what makes something toxic. Our ruling Actor Jim Carrey called aluminum a poison and toxin. Like many other chemicals, it could be, in dosages and scenarios that are rare. There is no scientific evidence suggesting otherwise. In fact, the only debate stems from a theory, not research that contradicts decades of immunizations. Attaching scientific sounding terms like ""neurotoxin"" can lend a sheen of respectability or fear depending on the usage. Look at the willingness of people to sign a petition banning Dihydrogen Monoxide (you probably call it water). But the fact is, Carrey’s claim has no basis in fact and ignores several studies that contradict it. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BD4940>],/factchecks/2015/jul/17/jim-carrey/jim-carrey-misfires-vaccine-claim/

Did a Vermont pastor get sentenced to prison for refusing to marry a gay couple?
","Perhaps you have seen in your social media feeds an article headlined, ""Christian Pastor in Vermont Sentenced to One Year in Prison After Refusing to Marry Gay Couple."" It received about 5,000 Facebook shares as well as interactions on other social media platforms. Is it real? We decided to take a closer look. The article was published at a site called NewsExaminer on July 10. It says that a pastor from Proctor, Vt., was sentenced to a year in federal prison after refusing to marry gay couples. It came just days after the Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, that same-sex marriage would be allowed in all 50 states. (The ruling didn’t legalize same-sex marriage in Vermont, which approved it on its own in 2009.) But the bottom line is that the NewsExaminer is a fake-news site, and has been classified as such by Snopes, the urban legends site. Through a posting to an NBC copycat website with the url www.nbc.com.co, the article gained traction through mistaken association with the genuine NBC News site. The article cites several individuals involved in the case, but none seem to exist. The Christian pastor who was sentenced, Paul Horner, is actually a recurring name used in stories published by the National Report and other fake news sites. According to Snopes.com, the character Paul Horner has been used in past articles about everything from the British street artist Banksy to a Dolphin mascot for a Christian organization. (We’ve previously run into the Zelig-like Horner in such articles as this one and this one.) The Hon. Myron Danus, the judge who supposedly made the ruling, is also fictitious. We checked the Vermont Court Administration Office in Montpelier, the U.S. District Court in Rutland County, and the Rutland County District Court to check if there is any judge by that name in the state, and there isn’t. Though the LGBT Pride Center referenced in the article is real -- or at least there is an organization with a similar name -- Gwen Hawkins, the supposed president of the organization, does not exist. Instead, the Pride Center of Vermont lists Kim Fountain as its executive director. We also couldn’t find a record for the Vermont Family Research Committee or its purported president, Steve Shand. There is one element of the article that is accurate: The town of Proctor exists. It is a small town in Rutland County, Vt.,with a population of just under 2,000. It is, as the article accurately says, ""home to the Vermont Marble Museum, and the only marble bridge in America."" However, the Christian Proctor Church is as fake as its pastor. According to the Proctor Town Offices, the town has only three churches: St. Dominic’s, Union, and St. Paul’s. Our ruling Posts about a Christian pastor in Vermont being sentenced to one year in prison after refusing to marry a gay couple have circulated on the Internet. However, the article was published at a known fake-news site, and we found no evidence to support the existence of key elements of the story, including the pastor, church, or the judge referenced in the article.

Chain email: Muslims tried to open nation's first Sharia court in Irving, Texas
","Muslims tried to open the nation’s first Sharia court in a Texas city, a chain email says. A Houston reader asked us about that. Sharia law, the religious law of Islam, can apply to issues ranging from dietary restrictions to divorces to punishment for stealing and killing, the Dallas Morning News noted in a February 2015 news story. In 2011, though, we found False a legislator’s claim that Michigan judges were using Sharia law in lieu of U.S. laws and the Constitution.

The chain email further said efforts by Van Duyne ""to stop this abomination will echo throughout the country, setting precedent for other cities and towns where Muslims attempt to establish footholds. Share this if you support the mayor’s efforts to put a screeching halt to the formation of illegal Sharia courts in her Texas town."" Irving mayor says mosque identified as starting Sharia court News stories and a commentary by Bud Kennedy of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram helped us catch up to a Feb. 6, 2015, Facebook post by Van Duyne in which she wrote: ""Sharia Law Court was NOT approved or enacted by the City of Irving. Recently, there have been rumors suggesting that the City of Irving has somehow condoned, approved or enacted the implementation of a Sharia Law Court in our City. Let me be clear, neither the City of Irving, our elected officials or city staff have anything to do with the decision of the mosque that has been identified as starting a Sharia Court.""  We reached out to Van Duyne, who by email pointed out a Feb. 2, 2015, news report by CBS 11 News headlined: ""North Texas Home to First Islamic Tribunal in U.S."" The station’s story, reported from Irving, said four local religious judges, guided by Sharia law, ""are offering up their services to handle cases involving divorce, business problems and other disputes among the community"" though not other civil or criminal matters nor child support, custody battles or asset transfers, the story said. Also, the story said, its rulings are nonbinding. Moujahed Bakhach, described as one of the tribunal judges, said generally that state and federal laws would always take precedent. In his Feb. 19, 2015, commentary, Kennedy did not repeat the first-in-the-land characterization. After describing local objections to a ""dispute panel"" offered at an Irving mosque as ""Shariah-phobia,"" Kennedy said: ""Imam Moujahed Bakhach of Fort Worth, two other area imams and a case manager from a Dallas law firm hear disputes for a $1,200 fee. We asked Van Duyne if she thought it accurate to say a Sharia court opened in Irving. It’s accurate, she said, that ""a tribunal has been formed in the greater DFW-area and they have indicated it functions in various locations such as Dallas, Richardson, Arlington and Irving. My understanding is they don’t operate in a single fixed location since the tribunal is essentially four men and they could be conducting their ‘court’ from an office, a mosque or elsewhere,"" Van Duyne emailed. Islamic Tribunal website Van Duyne also emailed us screenshots of the IslamicTribunal.org website, which we then clicked to, spotting this undated message: ""Over the past few days, some media speculation has led members of the local community to wonder if the Islamic Center of Irving is facilitating ‘Shariah Courts’ at the Mosque. The management of the Islamic Center of Irving categorically declares that no such court operates on the center’s premises."" The message continues: ""No other mosque in the area operates such courts. However, the Islamic Tribunal ...operates in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, independent of the mosques, to address a genuine need within our faith community for intra-community arbitration."" The message continued: ""Similar religious tribunals have existed for decades in the American Jewish and American Christian faith communities to resolve disputes, most especially within families. These religious tribunals are optional arbitration vehicles that only conduct their work when requested to do so by both parties involved in a dispute, do not attempt to impose any belief system upon any individual and work in compliance with State of Texas and U.S. law under the United States Constitution."" A ""mission"" section of the website says the tribunal exists to satisfy the ""need for a mediation and non-binding arbitration firm that adheres to Islamic principles in the Muslim community"" in Dallas/Fort Worth, also indicating it was formed in part to focus on marital disputes. The website also presents the tribunal’s ""constitution;"" its first article states the ""objective of this Court is to resolve any dispute among Muslims residing in USA while complying with the federal laws of the United States and Texas state laws under the approval of the Texas Judicial system."" Other articles indicate the tribunal is a Dallas-based nonprofit whose offices are: President: Imam Yusuf Ziya Kavakci, Ph.D., scholar in residence, Imam, Islamic Association of North Texas; Vice President: Imam Moujahed Bakhach, director of  Mediation Institute of North Texas; Treasurer: Imam Zia Sheikh, PhD, Imam, Islamic Center of Irving; and member, Dr. Taher Elbadawi, assistant lawyer in A&M Law Group. On her Facebook page, Van Duyne pointed out the Feb. 23, 2015, news story in the Morning News stating the tribunal had been launched in Dallas in 2014 to settle civil disputes among the growing Muslim population. Organizers, the story said, said its panel of arbitrators issues ""non-binding decisions on matters such as business disputes and religious divorces. They note its parallels with Jewish rabbinical courts and Catholic tribunals."" The News story said the court uses a conference room in a northeast Dallas law office, where one of the judges works, with hearings there or in conference rooms at some of nearly 60 North Texas mosques. The judge who works in the Dallas office, Taher el-Badawi, told the newspaper the tribunal had settled about two dozen cases, mostly of divorcing couples. ""Our community really needs an Islamic tribunal to solve problems,"" he said. ""And we save money and save time for all the community."" We left phone messages with the tribunal and the Islamic Center of Irving and didn’t hear back. A national expert Concurrently, we reached the Pew center; spokesman Stefan Cornibert nudged us to contact Lee Ann Bambach, an expert on Sharia law quoted in the center’s 2013 report who wrote a dissertation titled ""Faith-Based Arbitration by Muslims in an American Context."" Bambach, a Georgia lawyer, told us by phone she considers the Dallas-rooted Islamic Tribunal an alternative dispute resolution service--not a court working outside the bounds of U.S. law. ""They’re not trying to establish anything that’s going to take jurisdiction away from the state or federal courts,"" Bambach said. Similarly, she said, Christians and orthodox Jews sometimes adopt dispute resolution processes. Broadly, Bambach said, there is nothing in the U.S. she’d call a Sharia court. ""I’d call them dispute resolution services,"" she said. Not many services like the Islamic Tribunal otherwise exist in the U.S., Bambach said by email, with most alternative dispute resolution done informally in mosque settings. ""I am aware of no such tribunals/services that seek to enforce any aspect of sharia criminal law,"" Bambach said. Our ruling The chain email said Muslims ""attempted to establish the first Islamic Sharia court inside the United States in the town of Irving, Texas."" Not so; news stories and the Islamic Tribunal website indicate a few Muslim individuals teamed up to offer Sharia-governed, non-binding mediation services in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, including in Irving, with the declared intent of complying with state and federal laws. We spotted no evidence of residents trying to open a Sharia court with all the powers that word implies. We judge this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Allison Tant']","
Carlos Lopez-Cantera was an enthusiastic supporter of Arizona-style law, Allison Tant says
","Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera became the first Hispanic candidate to enter the Florida Senate race to replace U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio on July 15. Florida Democratic Party chair Allison Tant leveled a series of charges against the Republican, but the one that caught our attention was this one: that Lopez- Cantera ""voiced enthusiastic support for bringing an Arizona-style immigration law to Florida, calling the measure 'common sense.’ "" Lopez-Cantera, who was born in Spain to Cuban parents, is hoping to draw part of his support from Hispanic voters. Is it true that he was an enthusiastic supporter for an Arizona-style law, which some Hispanics feared would lead to racial profiling? Tant has omitted the full story about what Lopez-Cantera said about bringing such a law to Florida. What Lopez-Cantera said about the law in 2010 Signed into law by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer in 2010, SB 1070 requires police who stop a person to verify his or her immigration status if the officer reasonably suspects the person of being in the country illegally. (The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the key part of the law about police stops but struck down other portions in 2012.) In Florida at the time, two GOP candidates for governor -- Attorney General Bill McCollum and Rick Scott -- both expressed support for the law. Once elected however, Scott broke his promise to bring such a law to Florida. As PolitiFact Florida noted in 2014 after Scott chose Lopez-Cantera as his new No. 2, Lopez-Cantera expressed mixed views about an Arizona-style law between 2010 and 2011. ""As far as I’m concerned, I don’t think Florida has a problem like Arizona does,"" state Rep. Lopez-Cantera told the Miami Herald in May 2010. ""I realize there’s a problem in Arizona. They have a serious problem, but I don't think you can compare it to Florida."" In August 2010, Lopez-Cantera told the Tampa Bay Times: ""I am concerned that this could jeopardize civil liberties."" In November 2010, as Rep. William Snyder, R-Stuart, was drafting a bill for the upcoming session, Lopez-Cantera told the Tampa Tribune, ""As far as what the House is focusing on for the next year, I can tell you that's not high on the priority list,"" adding the House's primary concern was about the economy, not immigration. What Lopez-Cantera said about the law in 2011 As House majority leader and Miami-Dade’s delegation chair in 2011, Lopez-Cantera had to deal with two conflicting viewpoints within the GOP: hardliners who wanted a crackdown and Hispanic lawmakers and constituents who viewed such a push as anti-Hispanic. Legislators introduced the Florida Immigration Enforcement Act as HB 7089 and a similar bill in the Senate, SB 2040. The bills were not identical to Arizona’s law, but for immigrant advocates it raised fears that it would increase racial profiling. Some business-backed groups also raised concerns because there was a component that related to employers. The House bill would have required police to check the immigration status of a subject of a criminal investigation if the police had ""reasonable suspicion"" the person was in the country illegally. Also, employers would be required to check workers’ immigration status. The Senate counterpart didn’t go as far and only let police police check the status of an inmate -- not a person under investigation -- and it gave some wiggle room to employers. In March 2011, the House judiciary committee passed the bill 12-6. Lopez-Cantera wasn’t a member of that committee. But in his press release after the vote -- as Tant noted in her attack -- he spoke positively about the bill. ""Chairman Snyder and the Judiciary Committee recognize the unique and diverse history of our state and have worked hard to bring all stakeholders to the table to produce this piece of common sense, Florida immigration reform. This legislation is designed to preserve employment opportunities for Floridians through the use of the E-Verify system. ""The bill does not require law enforcement officers to ask individuals for immigration documentation during routine traffic stops. It does, however, give law enforcement officers the tools necessary to enforce the immigration laws of the United States. ""I look forward to watching this reasonable and effective approach to immigration reform work its way through the legislative process."" Lopez-Cantera didn’t state in the press release how he would vote on the bill. Activists opposing the bills turned up the heat and targeted Lopez-Cantera, holding a protest in front of his office. While the attacks were going on, the Herald reported that Lopez-Cantera planned to vote against the bill. ""Florida doesn’t need an immigration law,"" he said in April 2011. While the Senate passed a version of the bill, it never reached the full House, so Lopez-Cantera didn’t vote on it, and the bill died. (A press release from the Florida Democratic Party with Tant’s quote said that Lopez-Cantera ""voted"" for the law, but when we asked about that party spokesman Max Steele said it should have said ""supported."") In 2014, PolitiFact Florida fact-checked a claim by the Democratic Hispanic Caucus Miami-Dade chapter that in 2011 ""Lopez-Cantera 'staunchly supported' a Florida bill modeled after Arizona’s immigration law."" We rated that claim Mostly False. Steele defended Tant’s claim about Lopez-Cantera’s comments and support for the law. ""I can understand why the previous claim that he ‘staunchly supported’ the measure would receive the ruling it got, but our claim is that he ‘voiced enthusiastic support’ and called it ‘common sense,’ "" Steele said. ""He did voice support. He did call it common sense. The fact that he had other feelings at other times doesn’t change his praise of this measure in his capacity as majority leader."" A campaign adviser for Lopez-Cantera had nothing to add beyond our previous findings. Our ruling Tant said that Lopez-Cantera ""voiced enthusiastic support for bringing an Arizona-style immigration law to Florida, calling the measure 'common sense.’ "" Lopez-Cantera did call such a bill ""common sense,"" and he expressed support for it after a committee voted in favor in March 2011. However, Tant omits that in 2010 Lopez-Cantera said he didn’t think such a law was necessary and by April 2011, after he took heat over it, he said he wouldn’t vote for the bill — and he never had to. Tant has cherry-picked one statement Lopez-Cantera made in favor of the bill while ignoring multiple statements he made opposing it. We rate her claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097815100>],/factchecks/2015/jul/16/allison-tant/carlos-lopez-cantera-was-enthusiastic-supporter-ar/
"['Abortion', 'Candidate Biography', 'Civil Rights', 'Legal Issues', 'Women', 'Wisconsin', 'Tammy Baldwin']","
Scott Walker more restrictive on abortion than Reagan, other GOP presidents, Tammy Baldwin says
","It’s clear that Scott Walker’s views on abortion will get intensified scrutiny now that he has joined the crowded Republican presidential field. In 2014, during the final weeks of the campaign before he won re-election as governor, Walker was attacked in a TV ad by a national political action committee that works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights. And weeks before his White House run announcement on July 13, 2015, Walker was targeted twice: once in a TV ad by the nation’s oldest abortion rights advocacy group and once on a TV talk show by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin. Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, used her June 3, 2015 interview on MSNBC to cast Walker as out of step with other Republicans on abortion. After host Chris Hayes suggested that Walker’s support for a law banning abortion after 20 weeks was mainstream among Republicans, Baldwin agreed. But she drew a contrast, stating: ""Yes, but if you look at the history of those who have been elected president, Scott Walker's views are clearly more extreme than any Republican president in recent times -- much more extreme than President George W. Bush with regard to the issues of having exemptions that deal with the health and the life of the mother, and the issues of exemptions for rape victims and incest."" On abortion, is Walker to the right of any recent Republican president? Previous claims Some statements about Walker and abortion have missed the mark, including the two we mentioned. The TV ad by EMILY’s List shortly before Walker defeated Democrat Mary Burke in 2014 claimed Walker was ""forcing some women to undergo a transvaginal probe to get an abortion."" We rated it Half True. A law Walker signed says women can choose either a transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound, though in certain cases a transvaginal probe may be medically necessary. The TV ad by NARAL Pro-Choice America, which aired in June 2015 in Iowa and New Hampshire, claimed Walker had said that ""forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was 'just a cool thing.’ "" That was rated Mostly False. The ""cool"" reference wasn’t to forcing some women to get vaginal ultrasounds, but rather to the ultrasound technology that produces images from the womb. Nevertheless, there is no question that for decades -- going back to before his time as governor and as a state lawmaker -- Walker has been staunchly anti-abortion. Baldwin’s office didn’t respond to our requests for information to back her claim, and Walker’s campaign didn’t weigh in, either. But we can compare Walker’s public positions on abortion to those of recent GOP presidents. NARAL, Planned Parenthood We asked NARAL Pro-Choice America, formerly known as the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America about how they rate politicians on abortion rights. The groups told us they don’t produce ratings on a continuum. They put politicians into broad categories -- not on a scale that would rank one as more extreme, to use Baldwin’s term, than another. NARAL gave Walker and 13 other Republican presidential contenders a grade of F, for Fail. The group points to Walker’s votes in the Legislature and measures he has signed into law as governor restricting access to abortion services. Planned Parenthood rates the Republican and Democratic 2016 contenders more broadly, on access to abortion, affordable birth control and family planning. Like most of the other GOP hopefuls, Walker was given a red X on each measure, rather than a green checkmark. Planned Parenthood notes that besides wanting to ban abortion even in cases of rape and incest, Walker tried to repeal a law requiring insurance companies to cover prescription birth control and defunded Planned Parenthood, which is something Walker himself highlights in his campaign speeches. The website of the National Right to Life Committee, meanwhile, highlights the records of President Barack Obama and his four most recent predecessors, dating back to the late Ronald Reagan, but doesn’t do any ratings. So let’s look more closely at Walker and the three most recent GOP presidents, dating back to Reagan. Walker vs. Bushes, Reagan Walker’s basic position is clear. In 2010, a week before he was elected to his first term as governor, we rated True a claim that Walker wants to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother. He acknowledged that was his position. As Matt Sande of Pro-Life Wisconsin told us, since then, Walker has not contradicted that position in words or actions. In fact, Walker has underscored his support for banning abortion without exceptions commonly accepted by other abortion opponents. In March 2015, Walker released an ""open letter on life,"" which began by noting that he had ""earned a 100 percent rating with pro-life groups in Wisconsin."" And in June 2015, Walker pledged to sign legislation to ban abortions in Wisconsin after 20 weeks -- with no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. That measure was passed by the Legislature the next month and is awaiting Walker’s signature.      No recent Republican president has gone so far in opposing exceptions. As president, George H.W. Bush (1989-’93) and George W. Bush (2001-’09) both supported allowing abortions in cases of rape or incest, or to protect the life of the mother. The elder Bush said in 1992 he said: ""My own position on abortion is well-known and remains unchanged. I oppose abortion in all cases except rape or incest or where the life of the mother is at stake."" The younger Bush declared in 2006: ''My position has always been three exceptions: rape, incest and the life of the mother."" Meanwhile, Reagan (1981-’89), an idol of Walker’s, was closer to Walker’s position. He didn’t support an exception for rape or incest, but did support one to protect the life of the mother. In 1987, he promoted a bill with a provision that ""no funds appropriated by Congress shall be used to perform abortions, except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term."" Our rating Baldwin said Walker's views on abortion are more restrictive ""than any Republican president in recent times."" Walker supports outlawing abortion in all circumstances. The three most recent GOP presidents each supported exceptions, such as allowing abortion to protect the life of the mother. We rate Baldwin’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BBA100>],/factchecks/2015/jul/16/tammy-baldwin/scott-walker-more-restrictive-abortion-reagan-othe/

Trump’s ridiculous statement about “total” authority neglects Constitution
","President Donald Trump was asked during his White House briefing to explain his tweets in which he said that it’s up to him — not governors — to re-open states amid the COVID-19 pandemic. ""What provision in the Constitution gives the president the power to open or close state economies?"" a reporter asked Trump April 13. ""Numerous provisions,"" Trump replied.  ""We’ll give you a legal brief if you want.""  Reporters pressed Trump for details, but he never cited specific provisions in the Constitution or federal law. When a reporter asked again, Trump said, ""The authority is total, and that’s the way it’s got to be."" The White House did not respond to our emails seeking Trump’s evidence. The 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved for the states. A reporter asked Trump how he would overcome that restriction. Trump sidestepped the question: ""Well if some states refuse to open, I would like to see that person run for election. They’re going to open. They’re going to all open."" Federalism, which is a key component of our Constitution, means that the national government is responsible for broad governance, while states and cities have authority over local issues.  The president is the top elected official in the country, but he does not have supreme power to dictate all rules for states and local governments. The federal government only has powers given to it in the U.S. Constitution; the rest are reserved for the states, said Polly J. Price, a professor of law and global health at Emory University.  Trump does have some authority with respect to reopening the country such as on federal property including military bases within states, Price said.  But formal declaration of a ""national emergency"" does not confer do-whatever-is-needed authority on the president, said University of Texas law professor Robert Chesney.  ""The president very clearly does not have total authority over state and local governments,"" Chesney said. ""It is preposterous to claim such authority in our system, in which federalism has always been a bedrock element. It is equally preposterous to claim that state and local leaders require the president’s approval for anything. States are not mere political subdivisions of the federal government."" Issues with respect to social distancing and business closures are state matters. That means that Trump does not actually call the shots about re-opening swimming pools in Miami, gyms in Sacramento or barber shops in Cleveland. Both Democratic and Republican governors have said they control their own state orders, not Trump.  This isn’t the first time that Trump has made the case that he has unlimited power. In 2019, he said that Article 2 of the Constitution gave him ""the right to do whatever I want as president."" Article 2 gives the president ""executive power,"" but that’s not the same as total power over the states.  Legal experts say no part of the Constitution gives the president unlimited power. ""There is no authority. You can’t point to any clause of the Constitution that supports that,"" said David Schultz, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and political science professor at Hamline University.  When the framers drafted the Constitution, they kept in mind fear of King George III and wanted to avoid absolute power of a king, Schultz said. The Constitution aims to break up political power. ""That’s why the president doesn’t have total power,"" he said. Trump said he has ""total"" authority to reopen the states amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump and the White House have not explained what parts of the Constitution or laws he is referring to that he thinks give him ""total"" authority over governors.  Governors have the power to set rules to protect their residents’ public health such as closing swimming pools and schools and requiring social distancing. Trump does not have the power to undo the governors’ orders. In this case, his exaggeration is so vast that it qualifies as ridiculous. By our definition, that means his statement rates Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E2F200>],/factchecks/2020/apr/14/donald-trump/trumps-ridiculous-statement-about-total-authority-/
"['Economy', 'Workers', 'Iowa', 'Jack Whitver']","
Iowa had a strong job market and low unemployment before coronavirus
","Iowa’s Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver, R-Ankeny, said this month that Iowa had one of the lowest employment rates in the country and employers were struggling to find workers to fill jobs before protective measures to halt the spread of the coronavirus put almost 165,000 Iowans out of a job along with more than 16 million other Americans.  ""Prior to the emergence of the coronavirus and COVID-19, the U.S. economy had lifted millions out of poverty, expanded the workforce, and raised wages for huge numbers of Americans,"" Whitver wrote in an April 7 newsletter. ""Iowa had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, and many employers were scrambling to find qualified employees to fill their job openings."" A check of the facts shows that Iowa had one of the country's lowest unemployment rates before the arrival of COVID-19. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Iowa ranked 11th of the 50 states in February 2020 for unemployment, with a rate of 2.8 percent.  Iowa’s unemployment rate has seen historic lows recently as well. According to data from Iowa Workforce Development, the lowest nine months in the past 20 years for unemployment have been since 2018. The lowest unemployment rate over the past two decades was 1.9 percent in October 2018. The Iowa report for March is to be released April 17. We reached out to Whitver to ask what sources he was citing but he didn’t respond. This claim often is made by business and political leaders in Iowa, however, so we did our own sourcing by checking with those who would know and existing data. Matthew Kodis, a data analyst at the Iowa Economic Development Authority, said in an interview economists generally define full unemployment as below 3 percent, which Iowa had been under since August 2017.  The interview with Kodis was in February, as we were researching Iowa’s unemployment history. Kodis also said then that companies were having trouble finding employees, as Whitver claimed. In a 2019 report Kodis developed for Iowa Economic Development Authority, nearly half of surveyed companies reported that there was a low availability of workforce in their area, and 74 percent said they were experiencing workforce recruitment problems.  This hyper-competitive job market has led to slow growth for business hiring and overall state GDP compared to other states, Kodis said. One problem that arises is businesses aren’t able to expand without a solid pool of potential employees.  ""Right now, we aren’t necessarily seeing a negative impact on the economy, more so as we’re seeing slower growth than some states that have higher unemployment rates,"" he said in that February interview. In the same report, 46 percent of companies said they had plans to expand in the next three years, but 22.2 percent of those companies said expansions in Iowa may not be possible because of workforce shortages. The scarcity of employees contributed to an increase in wages, Iowa Association of Business and Industry president Mike Ralston said in an interview.  ""Employers understand that they have to have competitive pay and benefits,"" he said. ""I wouldn’t want to be an employer paying the lowest wage in an area, because I’m not going to get the employees, that’s for sure.""  However, an analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics statistics showed that 63% of Iowa workers earned less than the state’s median salary of $47,350 in May 2019, the last time for which Bureau of Labor Statistics were available. That is based on total employment of 1,549,460 workers in the report — up from 1,541,700 workers in May 2018.  Despite accounts of wage increases, Mike Owen, executive director of the Iowa Policy Project, said working Iowans had not seen meaningful wage increases since the 2008 recession.  ""Wages in Iowa have continued to be stagnant, have been unequal both in racial terms and in gender terms, and they have not provided, on balance, a good opportunity for Iowans just to meet a basic needs household budget,"" Owen said. Wage increases have also been slanted toward the highest earners. A 2019 report from the Iowa Policy Project called ""The State of Working Iowa""  showed that the median wage has only increased about 4.4 percent since 2009 — an increase of 80 cents to $18.40 — while wages in the 90th percentile have increased about 15 percent. Wages are also increasing at a lower rate than in most of a nine-state region in the Midwest. A February Mid-American Economy report by Ernie Goss, a regional economist who studies middle America at Creighton University, said average hourly wages in Iowa had increased 3 percent in the past 12 months, which placed Iowa seventh among the nine states he surveyed. The highest wage growth was in Arkansas, with a 6.7 percent increase. Statistics have shown a reduction in the nation’s poverty rate. A 2019 report from the U.S. Census Bureau shows 38.1 million Americans in poverty in 2018, 1.4 million fewer than in 2017 and 2.5 million fewer than in 2016.  2018 was also the first time the U.S. poverty rate fell below pre-2008 recession levels.  Iowa’s poverty rate is also lower than it was in 2015, but it rose from 10.7 percent in 2017 to 11.2 percent in 2018, according to Talk Poverty. In 2018, the mean household income in Iowa was $75,951, and 62 percent of households had an income lower than $75,000, according to the Census Bureau. While Whitver didn’t specify a timeframe for his claim that millions in the U.S. have been lifted out of poverty, he would be correct dating back to 2015. However, the poverty rate in Iowa increased in 2018. Whitver said unemployment in Iowa was among the lowest in the country before the U.S. deliberately shutdown parts of the economy to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and that companies were struggling to find workers. He also said millions in the U.S. had been lifted out of poverty and wages had been increased.  This was all before the coronavirus, and subsequent statewide measures to contain its spread, wreaked havoc on Iowa’s employment and economy. The United States has almost certainly entered a recession, and the economic outlook across the country is grim, but Iowa was in a relatively good place just a month ago. Iowa unemployment had been at a historic low since 2017, and in February it ranked 11th in the country. Employers in Iowa did have trouble finding qualified workers to fill positions.  Wage increases are less clear. Wages have gone up 3 percent in the last year, but that increase hasn’t kept pace with many other states in the Midwest. Additionally, median wages only increased 4.4 percent since 2009, and the biggest wage increases were concentrated at the top. The poverty rate in the U.S. has been declining steadily since 2015, and in 2018 it reached pre-recession levels.

No, these 800 numbers won’t help you track your stimulus check
","Americans have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of their federal stimulus checks, and some Facebook posts are taking advantage of their anticipation by directing people to ""dial this number"" to find out more about the payment. Multiple posts on the network are instructing people to dial an 800 number to find out when they will receive their check. Some versions show a different phone number and add that you have to enter the last four digits of your Social Security number. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This is a trick. The Internal Revenue Service says it has a tool coming to its website to help people check the status of their checks. But it has not issued a phone number associated with the payments and certainly not these 800 numbers: the ones in the post connect callers with a phone sex line.

Michiganders aren’t banned from buying American flags
","Since the first COVID-19 cases were identified in Michigan in March, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has tapped her emergency powers to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  A recent blog post on TeaParty.org claims that includes prohibiting Michiganders from buying American flags.  ""And there it is…"" reads the post’s headline. ""Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer bans buying US flags during lockdown."" The post features an April 11 tweet that shows a photo of American flags behind yellow caution tape. ""No buying flags in MI,"" the tweet says. ""This is Costco.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Citing ""deaths in the hundreds"" and ""confirmed cases in the thousands,"" Whitmer, a Democrat elected to her office in 2018, issued executive order 2020-42 to take effect on April 9, 2020. The order, described as a ""temporary requirement to suspend activities that are not necessary to sustain or protect life,"" does not mention flags. It does direct people to stay home, with exceptions, and requires businesses that remain open for in-person sales to follow rules including limiting how many people can be in a store at the same time.  The order also requires businesses to close areas of the store — ""by cordoning them off, placing signs in aisles, posting prominent signs, removing goods from shelves, or other appropriate means"" — that are dedicated to carpet, flooring, furniture, garden center and plant nurseries and paint. Flags are not listed, but they’re addressed at the top of a ""frequently asked questions"" page on the governor’s website. Q. Does Executive Order 2020-42 prohibit buying an American flag?  A: No. While the order places certain limits on how goods are sold, it does not ban Michiganders from buying any item, including flags.  Shelter-in-place orders around the country have disrupted daily life and in some cases made it more difficult to obtain everything from toilet paper to appliances. It’s possible that it could be harder for someone in Michigan, or other states, to buy an American flag. But that’s different from the governor banning residents from making such a purchase.  We rate this blog post False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B9CCC0>],/factchecks/2020/apr/14/facebook-posts/michiganders-arent-banned-buying-american-flags/

Hochul rewrites history with ventilator claim
","Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul has been talking to news outlets across New York State about the Covid-19 crisis.  In a recent appearance on WIVB-TV in Buffalo, she talked about the availability of ventilators. Anchor Luke Moretti asked Hochul: ""What’s the situation with the ventilators? I know there was that bit of a back and forth between upstate, downstate a little while ago? Where do we stand right now? Are we in good shape with ventilators?""  ""Well, we always have been in good shape with ventilators,"" Hochul replied. Gov. Andrew Cuomo ""was simply trying to get an inventory to see if there are communities where there is a surplus of ventilators and he was simply saying if we can share 20 percent of your excess, your non-used ventilators, to help people in other parts of the state on a voluntary basis, that would be great. And, of course, there was a reaction to that, which was not positive, and that’s unfortunate, because I think that we always respond in a way that we look out for each other.""  She further described how first responders pitch in during snowstorms in other parts of the state, adding ""we were never going to leave anyone in Western New York without the support they need."" She also said the urgent need for ventilators has subsided somewhat because of shipments of the breathing equipment from other states and China.    We were struck that she said Cuomo was ""simply saying"" that hospitals could share their ventilators on a ""voluntary"" basis.  Cuomo made clear during his daily briefing on April 3 that he intended to sign an executive order that would allow the state to move unused ventilators from one part of the state to another.   The headline the Cuomo administration wrote on the day of the announcement indicated as much: ""Amid Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic, Governor Cuomo Announces Executive Order Allowing State to Redistribute Ventilators & Personal Protective Equipment to Hospitals with Highest Need.""    During a press briefing, Cuomo said that more ventilators were necessary to meet the state’s needs, and that he has been working with suppliers in China.  ""But we are going to have to redeploy ventilators from across the system,"" he said. ""In other words, there are hospitals that have ventilators. There are hospitals that have (personal protective) equipment. There are private-sector companies that have PPE equipment that they are not using that we are going to need to redeploy to the places in the hospitals where we need them,"" he said.  Cuomo also acknowledged during the briefing that hospital administrators who would lose ventilators under his plan are upset. ""I had a conversation with a hospital administrator yesterday,"" he said. ""I understand they don't want to give up their ventilators. Ventilators are expensive pieces of equipment. I understand that, even if they're not using them, they are reluctant to see them go out the door. The theory is if the government gets them, they will never get them back. I understand that. But I don't have an option."" He added later: ""I'm going to sign an executive order that says the state can take ventilators and (personal protective equipment) from institutions that don't need them now and redeploy them to other parts of the state and other hospitals that do need them. Those institutions will either get their ventilator back or they will be reimbursed and paid for their ventilator so they can buy a new ventilator."" He was asked later in that briefing about how many the state would need to redeploy, and he said the state hadn’t done that calculation, but he added several hundred ventilators could be available.  ""So am I willing to deploy the National Guard and inconvenience people for several hundred lives? You’re damn right I am,"" Cuomo said.  Reaction to the plan was swift, with upstate hospital executives and elected officials expressing  their concerns.  Jody Lomeo, chief executive officer of Kaleida Health and chair-elect of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said that he was opposed to the executive order and would ""welcome and encourage us all to develop a more collaborative plan.""  Thomas Quatroche Jr., Erie County Medical Center’s chief executive officer and chair of the Healthcare Association of New York State, said  Cuomo’s executive order, as announced, would ""place our patients and community at risk.""  The following day, April 4, Cuomo talked about taking 20 percent of a hospital’s unused ventilators.    The executive order that Cuomo described on April 3 was never signed.  On April 6, HANYS, the hospital group, said that it understood that any redeployment of equipment would be on a voluntary basis.  On April 7, Cuomo signed an executive order leaving the movement of medical supplies and equipment up to the state Department of Health. It does not mention the National Guard nor 20 percent of available inventory. It states: ""DOH may shift any such items not currently needed, or needed in the short term future by a health care facility, to be transferred to a facility in urgent need of such inventory, for purposes of ensuring New York hospitals, facilities and health care workers have the resources necessary to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, and distribute them where there is an immediate need.""   In reaction to the order that Cuomo did sign, hospital executives, such as Lomeo, and elected officials, such as Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, said they were pleased by the change.  Quatroche Jr., of ECMC and HANYS, said: ""We are pleased the governor’s executive order gives the commissioner of health the ability to work collaboratively with hospitals to identify needs across New York State and provide resources in ‘real time.’""  Hochul's answer to Moretti, the news broadcaster, came on April 8, one day after Cuomo signed an executive order that hospital executives found to be more cooperative than how the governor initially described it. We reached out to Hochul’s office, and her spokesperson, Bryan Lesswing, said: ""The lieutenant governor was giving a status update on New York State's close coordination with hospitals to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, calling for state unity not division, and reinforcing Western New York's preparedness. Any other characterization is simply untrue and an unfair attack while New York State government officials have been consistently transparent in keeping New Yorkers updated with the latest facts."" Hochul’s office also said that there was nothing contradictory in what Hochul said because the state was indeed working with hospitals to share equipment on a voluntary basis, and that she was speaking broadly about the current status with ventilators and then talked about the dialogue between upstate and downstate in Moretti’s question.  Hochul said Cuomo was simply saying that hospitals could share 20 percent of their unused ventilators on a voluntary basis.  That’s not how hospital executives and other elected officials heard Cuomo describe his initial plan, thus explaining the immediate backlash. And those who listened to the governor’s televised briefing heard him say this: ""So am I willing to deploy the National Guard and inconvenience people for several hundred lives? You’re damn right I am.""  Parsing that quote to find any semblance of ""voluntary"" is beyond challenging. Cuomo said the state would move hospital equipment from one part of the state to harder-hit areas that desperately needed them because of the Covid-19 outbreak.  When the plan changed, after significant backlash, hospitals and others praised the administration for acting collaboratively.  Hochul misled viewers about what happened.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire.   ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BB5D80>],/factchecks/2020/apr/14/kathy-hochul/hochul-rewrites-history-ventilator-claim/

COVID-19 skeptics say there’s an overcount. Doctors in the field say the opposite
","On the day that doctors and nurses in New York City treated over 1,500 new COVID-19 patients, conservative pundit Candace Owens claimed that deaths from the pandemic coronavirus have been inflated. ""Apparently, doctors and nurses around the world are wondering why no one is dying from heart attacks or strokes any more, Owens tweeted April 6. ""Flu and pneumonia deaths also went off a cliff. Turns out everyone is only dying of coronavirus now. Gee, I wonder why."" Apparently, doctors and nurses around the world are wondering why no one is dying from heart attacks and strokes anymore. Flu and pneumonia deaths also went off a cliff. Turns out everyone is only dying of #Coronavirus now. Gee. I wonder why. https://t.co/HOX2Tc5PWt An exaggerated death count is a persistent talking point. On April 4, Owens tweeted ""State departments of Public Health are reporting the number of deaths BEFORE the medical examiners have even concluded the cause of death,"" she said. ""There would be no legitimate way to report how many people die daily.""  Are Owens’ claims correct? We asked her for evidence but did not hear back. What we found is that her statement is at odds with doctors, who say the data, in fact, reflects an undercount. Here’s why the details of death reporting back up the doctors more than the pundits. Owens is wrong that only medical examiners determine a person’s cause of death. Formal death certificates start with the attending doctor. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells physicians to list the immediate cause of death, such as cardiac or respiratory arrest, and then proceed to the underlying disease that caused the heart or breathing to stop. The underlying cause should be ""the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death."" If a person showed up in the emergency room with COVID-19 symptoms and a heart attack, there could be a judgement call as to what goes in as the underlying cause. But Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said there would be strong argument to note the key role of COVID-19. ""I would put COVID-19 as the primary cause,"" Plescia said. ""Because most likely, the heart attack was caused by the fever or a difficulty in breathing."" There’s no question that the virus lands harder on people with pre-existing heart and lung problems. ""If those individuals are positive for COVID-19 and have symptoms, COVID-19 is typically being listed on the death certificate as the cause of death, with their other diseases listed as contributory,"" said Dr. Sally Aiken, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners. Aiken added, ""it is not a conspiracy, or any different than what occurs during non-COVID-19 times."" The CDC said in a statement that if it works with death certificate data, it will add a death to the COVID-19 tally regardless on which line the disease is listed. It’s important to note that death certificates are not the only — or even primary way — the states report coronavirus deaths.  New York, which to date accounts for over 40% of deaths nationwide, does not use death certificate data for reporting COVID-19 fatalities. When a person with the virus dies, hospitals or nursing homes tell their local health officials who then notify the state health department, which in turn sends a report to Washington. Providers in New York use this form to record the death, and unlike a full death certificate, it provides just one place to note the disease.  This quick reporting form lacks the details that go into a death certificate. Like seasonal flu, COVID-19 is what is known as a nationally notifiable disease. Heart attacks and strokes fall into the larger group of diseases that are not tracked in real time. The system to gather COVID-19 data is designed to help public health officials track what is happening as quickly as possible. Death certificates are processed at a slower pace.   There are several reasons COVID-19 victims might not make it into the quick reporting system. ""Doctors won't record a death until they are certain,"" Plescia said. ""And with the high volume of cases, they may not be reporting because they move on to other things."" Plescia added that if a person dies on the way to the hospital, or very soon after, they won’t be tested for the virus. ""There’s nothing any more you can do for them,"" he said. Aiken said if the person had no symptoms of the coronavirus, her department wouldn’t test them. ""These decedents are not being tested for COVID-19 as a matter of course,"" Aiken said. Given the scarcity of tests, Aiken said, that’s generally true across the country.  Plescia said, ""if there’s any error, it’s in under-reporting."" Aiken echoed the point, and said it applies to death certificates as well. ""COVID-19 deaths will likely be under-reported on death certificates and not over-reported,"" Aiken said. ""This will be especially true as deaths that occur in homes, and not the hospital, mount."" Owens said that ""everyone is dying of coronavirus now."" Her post reflects a misunderstanding of how COVID-19 interacts with other health conditions and how deaths are reported.  The physicians we reached said it’s important to track when COVID-19 triggers a pre-existing heart or lung condition. To meet the need for immediate data, New York sends the CDC summaries of COVID-19 deaths, and not the full death certificates.  People familiar with the tracking system say some victims go uncounted. They told us that the limited supply of testing, the pace of work at hospitals and deaths that take place outside any medical facility point to an underreporting of COVID-19 deaths, not an overreporting.

"['National', 'Coronavirus', 'Pennsylvania', 'Rick Santorum']","
Rick Santorum said Trump was ‘ahead of the curve’ on China travel restrictions. That’s mostly false
","Former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum on Monday defended President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak in an interview with CNN anchor John King. ""The president looks like he was ahead of the curve – as you know, he talks about this all the time – on shutting down travel from China,"" said Santorum, a Republican from Pennsylvania who lost his bid for a third term in 2006. Santorum’s comments came one day after Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told CNN anchor Jake Tapper that earlier implementation of social-distancing and stay-at-home orders could have saved lives lost to the coronavirus. Santorum called Fauci’s remarks ""Monday morning quarterbacking"" and sought to redirect attention to other coronavirus mitigation strategies he believes the Trump administration embraced early on. Fauci, later on Monday, said his remarks were hypothetical. We wondered whether Trump’s decision to restrict travel from China was as prescient as Santorum described. The administration announced the restrictions on Jan. 31 and they took effect two days later. The policy prohibited non-U.S. citizens who had traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the country. Trump has repeatedly said he acted to restrict travel – first from China, then from Iran and finally from Europe – despite objections from experts. ""But we closed those borders very early, against the advice of a lot of professionals, and we turned out to be right. I took a lot of heat for that,"" Trump said on March 4. Later that same day, Trump spoke about the rationale behind his decision, telling Fox anchor Sean Hannity, ""Everybody said, it’s too early, it’s too soon, and good people, brilliant people, in many ways, doctors and lawyers and, frankly, a lot of people that work on this stuff almost exclusively. And they said, don’t do it."" Trump repeated the claim again at the Scranton town hall he held on March 5, saying he imposed the travel restrictions ""against the advice of almost everybody."" The World Health Organization did caution against the overuse of travel restrictions around the time the one imposed by the U.S. first took effect, but public health officials in this country and many airlines themselves agreed on the policy’s importance. Several airlines voluntarily halted flights between the U.S. and China a few days before the administration’s travel restrictions took effect. And Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said experts in his department all agreed that restricting travel from countries with coronavirus outbreaks was the right call. ""The travel restrictions that we put in place in consultation with the president were very measured and incremental,"" Azar told reporters on Feb. 7. ""These were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS."" What was the rest of the world thinking at the same time? We consulted Think Global Health, an initiative of the U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations that is tracking travel restrictions on China due to COVID-19. By the group’s count, about 45 nations restricted travel from China before the United States. That number covers variations of travel restrictions in effect up to and including Feb. 1. Think Global Health’s tracker includes partial or total land border closures, suspension of flights to and from China, visa restrictions, such as a pause on visa-on-arrival programs, and entry restrictions (similar to what the United States implemented). ""While the United States was not one of the first countries to impose restrictions against travel from China, nor was it late to do so relative to the actions of others,"" said Samantha Kiernan, a research associate at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Rather, the United States acted around the same time that many other countries did."" Santorum said, ""The president looks like he was ahead of the curve – as you know, he talks about this all the time – on shutting down travel from China."" Trump wasn’t ""ahead of the curve,"" as Santorum said. He was following the advice of experts in his own administration – and the actions of the industry directly affected by the move. And about 45 nations restricted travel from China before the United States. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

No, Bill Gates didn’t say no church services until everyone is vaccinated
","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, whose charitable foundation has long focused on public-health initiatives, has emerged as a prominent voice in public discussions about how to combat the new coronavirus. But a recent blog post misrepresents his statements about recovering from the current crisis.  The headline of an April 9 blog post on the website Pulpit & Pen says: ""Church services can’t resume until we’re all vaccinated, says Bill Gates."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The blog goes on to say that ""Gates now argues that ‘mass gatherings’ (churches) will not meet again until a vaccine is found and everyone is vaccinated.""  The post links to an April 2 story on MyNorthwest.com about an interview Gates gave to ""CBS This Morning."" In the interview, according to CBS, Gates called for a nationwide social isolation policy to slow the pandemic’s spread.  ""It’ll help everyone get out of this more quickly and reduce the deaths and reduce the economic reduction,"" Gates said, ""if we implement these strong isolation measures on a countrywide basis."" We listened to the nearly 30-minute interview and we didn’t hear Gates mention churches. Rather, he says that the government needs to prioritize testing, and talks about when a vaccine could be ready for COVID-19 and when communities could open back up. He said that he expects that by the end of April some regions will see the number of COVID-19 cases plateau and then decrease. ""We understand what needs to be done here, it’s going to be very painful, but taking the pain early means there’s a lot less pain both medically and economically than if we dilly-dally and wait until every town has big numbers before we react,"" he said.  He then speculated about what opening up would look like.  ""Which activities have, like schools, have such benefit and can be done in a way that the risk of transmission is very low? And which activities like mass gatherings may be, in a certain sense, more optional. And so until you’re widely vaccinated, those may not come back at all,"" he said. When ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Anthony Mason asked Gates if life will ever be the same, Gates said, ""not for some time.""  What he doesn’t say? That church services can’t resume until we’re all vaccinated.  Considering what the world will look like as regions slow the spread of the coronavirus and people start to resume their lives, Gates suggests that some mass gatherings may not come back before enough people have been vaccinated against COVID-19.  But Gates doesn’t specify that this means ""church"" gatherings, nor does he have any power to forbid church services ""until we’re all vaccinated,"" as the post says. In the interview he mentions talking to pharmaceutical companies and federal agencies about how to collaborate on a vaccine, but he doesn’t imply that he has control over what policies the government could adopt with respect to such gatherings.

Trump’s false claim that it’s up to him — not governors — to open states
","President Donald Trump said it’s up to him — not the governors — to decide when to reopen the states amid the COVID-19 pandemic. ""For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion, some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect,"" Trump tweeted April 13. ""It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons. With that being said, the Administration and I are working closely with the Governors, and this will continue. A decision by me, in conjunction with the Governors and input from others, will be made shortly!"" ....It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons. With that being said, the Administration and I are working closely with the Governors, and this will continue. A decision by me, in conjunction with the Governors and input from others, will be made shortly! Trump’s tweet comes as he weighs whether to extend his stay-at-home guidelines, which expire April 30, a decision he has described as ""the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make."" Reopening businesses, schools and public facilities is a decision with major implications for public health, the economy and education. But Trump’s tweet is misleading because governors do have power to shut down — and reopen — businesses and public spaces in their state. Trump has traded barbs with governors during the pandemic, especially over where responsibility lies in securing medical supplies for the states. But governors have largely made their own calls about what to close down. It’s not surprising, then, that governors pushed back against Trump’s comments on who has authority to ""open up the states."" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican and chair of the National Governors Association, said on CNN: ""Governors made decisions to take various actions in their states based on what they thought was right for their states, based on the facts on the ground, talking with doctors and scientists. And I think individual governors who made those decisions will have the ultimate decision about what to do with their states."" New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, said on CNN that ""all these orders are executive state orders, so therefore it would be up to the state and governor to undo all of that."" We contacted the White House to ask for evidence behind Trump’s claim and did not get a reply. On March 16, Trump issued guidelines to slow the spread of COVID-19, which included recommendations on social distancing and to ""listen to and follow the directions of your state and local authorities."" But it was the governors who issued more specific directives that closed non-essential businesses and many other facilities, such as schools, bars, swimming pools and beaches. Many legal experts and political scientists have said that governors have the authority to make such decisions. States provide licenses for businesses and hold the primary responsibility for making decisions about public health. ""The simple answer is governors have way more legal authority than the president of the United States to make these decisions about closing and opening facilities, closing and opening the economy,"" said David Schultz, professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University. University of Texas law professor Robert Chesney told PolitiFact that Trump has no inherent or statutory authority to command the governors to change shelter-in-place or business-shutdown orders. While federal powers are supreme, they are limited in scope, Chesney wrote in the Lawfare Blog in March. State governments are independent entities, not mere subordinate layers underneath the federal government, he wrote. ""The federal government cannot commandeer the machinery of the state governments (or, by extension, of local governments),"" Chesney wrote. ""That is, the federal government cannot coerce the states into taking actions to suit federal policy preference. … And so, the federal government cannot compel state and local officials to promulgate different rules on social distancing and the like."" No existing federal law — including the Public Health Service Act and the Stafford Act — can be read to confer such authority on the president, Chesney wrote. And there is little chance that this Congress will pass a law that gives Trump power to override state and local rules.  James Hodge Jr., a health law professor at Arizona State University, said the president can’t simply command states to re-open. ""He can strongly encourage, advise, or even litigate whether states’ authorities to restrict public movements re: shelter in place or stay home orders are warranted, but cannot tell sovereign governors to lift these orders all at once just because the federal government determines it is high time to do so,"" he told PolitiFact in an email. There are other ways Trump could pressure governors, tweeted University of Texas law school professor Steve Vladeck. He could pull emergency funding, or call the federal workforce back into work, Vladeck listed as examples. Still, most action has been taken by local authorities. Wendy K. Mariner, Boston University health law professor, said the governors have the authority to end their closure orders, though that isn’t the same as ordering them to reopen, which some may not be able to afford to do. Also, in most states, the state legislature can end the emergency declaration if the governor keeps it going beyond the period specified by statute. Trump’s tweet raises some practical implications. Congress can pass legislation to regulate interstate commerce, but it would be exceedingly odd for the federal government to require businesses to open.  ""As a practical matter, such an unprecedented action would be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce,"" she said. Trump also tweeted that he’s making a decision ""in conjunction with the Governors and input from others."" But governors don’t necessarily speak with a collective voice, said Chris Cooper, a Western Carolina University political scientist, who noted that some states have not enacted statewide stay-at-home orders. Though Trump has criticized some governors, he has generally not interfered with their powers. In a press briefing April 10, Trump said that he had faith in Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to make the right decision about whether to reopen schools in May. ""I like to allow governors to make decisions without overruling them, because from a constitutional standpoint, that’s the way it should be done,"" he said. ""If I disagreed, I would overrule a governor, and I have that right to do it. But I’d rather have them — you can call it ‘federalist,’ you can call it ‘the Constitution,’ but I call it ‘the Constitution.’ I would rather have them make their decisions."" Trump said ""it is the decision of the President,"" not governors, to ""open up the states."" The White House provided no evidence to show that it is up to Trump and not the governors to reopen the states. The governors used their authority to issue emergency orders to close non-essential businesses and public spaces such as beaches and swimming pools, and they can use their powers to reopen them. Trump can pressure governors to act as he sees fit, but he has not provided evidence that he can decide whether to reopen the states.

Now there are suspicions online that certain powerful people were tipped off to the threat of the coronavirus in time to protect their finances. One Facebook post claims that after being tipped off by government officials, the chief executive officers of more than 14 major companies resigned in order to be able to sell stocks they owned. Here’s the post:   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Among those listed, we did find two examples of departing CEOs selling company stock, but that was after the outbreak was publicly known, and both were still with their companies. There’s no evidence of any coordinated effort by government officials to give 14 CEOs advance information about the coronavirus that they could use for personal profit.  CEOs can depart for any number of reasons, including normal succession planning, or moves by the board to shake up leadership. CEOs and companies don’t always go public with all the reasons behind such departures.  ""Just like politicians leaving to spend more time with their families, CEOs’ actual reasons for departure are rarely described accurately,"" corporate-governance expert Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, told PolitiFact. A public company is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to explain a CEO’s departure only if the CEO resigned because of a disagreement with the company over operations, policies or practices, or if the CEO was removed for cause, said Douglas Chia, president of Soundboard Governance, a corporate governance consulting firm, and a fellow at Rutgers University’s Center for Corporate Law and Governance. Such rules are in place to protect investors’ rights. To deter insider trading, CEOs, other senior executives and board members are generally restricted from trading in their own company's stock, except during designated trading windows, Chia said. Those windows usually open in the two weeks immediately after the company’s quarterly earnings report is released. The trades must be cleared with a company’s legal department and reported within two days to the SEC, Chia said. The COVID-19 disease can be traced back to Dec. 31, when the government in Wuhan, China, confirmed that health authorities were treating dozens of cases of pneumonia from an unknown cause. Eight days later, China identified it as a new type of coronavirus. The first coronavirus case in the United States was confirmed on Jan. 21. We found that of the 14 companies listed in the post, only two had corporate CEOs who resigned their posts — and actually left their companies — after the coronavirus surfaced in China. Another two CEOs sold company stock after the outbreak. At the time of the sales, however, the outbreak was already publicly known, and the CEOs hadn’t yet left their companies.  We found no evidence the CEOs received advance information about the coronavirus or that they left in order to be freed from regulations that restricted their ability to sell stock. Of the corporate CEOs alluded to in the Facebook post, two resigned between Dec. 31, 2019, and March 29, 2020, the date of the post — and left their companies: Harley-Davidson announced Feb. 28 that Matthew Levatich had stepped down as CEO and a director. The company’s shares had fallen 46% since he took charge in May 2015. MGM Resorts announced Feb. 12 that Jim Murren had decided not to serve out his contract, which ran through the end of 2021, but that he would stay on until a successor was named.  MGM’s announcement, the earlier of the two, came two weeks after the Trump administration suspended entry into the United States by any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days. On Feb. 19 and 20, Murren sold more than $22 million of the company’s common stock, at between $32.15 and $32.17 a share, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The sales were made public to the SEC. About a month later, MGM closed its Las Vegas casinos because of the coronavirus, and Murren acquired 6,000 shares of MGM restricted stock units. On the day Murren’s purchase was disclosed, March 18, the stock price had dropped to $7.14. But Murren was still CEO during both sets of stock transactions. He stepped down as CEO on March 22, the same day it was announced he would lead a state coronavirus task force formed by Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak.  Five CEOs stepped down from their positions, but were staying with their companies as executive chairman, a top leadership post that typically involves some day-to-day duties in addition to a seat on the board. Companies often say they want the former CEO to stay for a limited period of time to ensure a smooth transition to the new CEO, Chia said. CEOs who resigned but stayed on as executive chairman were still under restrictions for trading in their company’s stock.  Walt Disney’s Robert Iger stepped down Feb. 25 after a 15-year tenure as CEO, but remained with Disney as executive chairman, the company said in a statement.  Lockheed Martin announced March 16 that Marillyn Hewson would be replaced effective June 15, but that she would remain as executive chairman. She sold $9.5 million in Lockheed stock on Jan. 29. IBM on Jan. 30 announced a new CEO to replace Virginia Rometty. But it said Rometty would continue as executive chairman and serve through the end of 2020, when she would retire after almost 40 years with the company. LinkedIn: announced Feb. 5 that Jeffrey Weiner ""decided to take on a new role as executive chairman."" He won’t step down as CEO until June 1. Mastercard announced Feb. 25 that Ajay Banga would transition to the position of executive chairman on Jan. 1, 2021, and remain CEO until then.  Three of the CEOs cited on the list left their posts or announced their departures before the coronavirus outbreak surfaced. eBay’s Devin Wenig tweeted that his departure was because ""it became clear that I was not on the same page as my new Board."" That was on Sept. 25, more than three months before the first report out of Wuhan. T-Mobile announced Nov. 18, 2019, that John Legere would depart on April 30. Nissan announced Sept. 9 that Hiroto Saikawa had indicated he was willing to resign and the board asked him to resign, effective Sept. 16. His term was marked by controversy over the arrest of former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn, turmoil with partner Renault SA and a sharp falloff in profits, the Wall Street Journal reported. In a few cases, the CEO departures were long-planned, or at a subsidiary level, not at the parent company. And one purported CEO resignation wasn’t that at all. Nestle CEO Mark Schneider is still in place. The post might have been referring to Fernando Mercé. He resigned Feb. 21 as president and CEO of Nestlé Waters North America, a subsidiary, ""due to personal reasons,"" the company told BevNET.  Hulu CEO Randy Freer was stepping down, The Wall Street Journal reported Jan. 31, as new owner Walt Disney Co. integrates the streaming service more closely into its direct-to-consumer business. Freer’s departure had been expected since Disney took over control of Hulu last May, The Verge reported. Volkswagen said Luca de Meo, the head of the automaker’s Spanish brand, SEAT, resigned Jan. 7. He’s becoming the new CEO of Renault. But Herbert Diess, CEO of the parent company, has been in place for two years. Microsoft has had the same CEO, Satya Nadella, since 2014. The company announced March 13 that co-founder Bill Gates stepped down from the board to dedicate more time to his philanthropic activities, but would remain as a technology adviser to Nadella and others in the company.  Minow said it’s good that executives are required to disclose their personal sales of company stock so that their actions can be scrutinized. But she advocates for rules that would prohibit top executives from selling their company stock until three to five years after they’ve left the company. ""We want them to be thinking long term up until the day they leave,"" she said. A Facebook post claimed that CEOs of 14 large companies received advance information about the coronavirus and then resigned in order to be freed from restrictions on selling stock. Among the companies listed, only two of the CEOs resigned after the coronavirus outbreak and left their companies. One sold a large amount of his company stock after his resignation was announced — but while he was still with the company, and well after the outbreak had made news. We found no evidence of any effort to give advance information to the 14 CEOs so that they use it to profit personally. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097880E80>],/factchecks/2020/apr/13/facebook-posts/ceos-didnt-resign-trade-stock-covid-tip/

No, seven children in Senegal didn’t die after COVID-19 vaccines
","Scientists around the world are racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19 and some trials are underway. There aren’t, however, ""mass vaccinations"" happening in Africa that are causing kids to die, as a recent Facebook post claims.

Joe Biden’s claim about Donald Trump’s ‘slow’ travel restriction needs context
","President Donald Trump routinely claims that he went against everyone’s wishes when he decided to restrict travel from China to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the United States. Because he did, and fast, thousands of lives were saved, Trump says. But Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said Trump’s response wasn’t all that quick. Biden told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on April 5 that Trump trailed dozens of other countries in issuing travel restrictions on China. (This was a week before Stephanopoulos confirmed he had COVID-19.) ""He indicated that I complimented him on dealing with China. Well, you know, 45 nations had already moved to keep, block China's personnel from being able to come to the United States before the president moved,"" Biden said. ""It's about pace. It's about the urgency. And I don't think there's been enough of it, urgency."" PolitiFact decided to put Biden’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter. Taken literally, Biden’s statement that 45 countries blocked Chinese personnel from ""being able to come to the United States"" doesn’t make sense — the countries were dealing with travel from China into their own countries, of course. Biden’s campaign did not provide an on-the-record clarification. Based on the context of the interview, Biden’s point was that 45 nations imposed restrictions on travel from China before the United States’ own restriction, therefore the United States was slow on this front. We found that the United States acted around the same time as did many other countries. It wasn’t the first to restrict travel from China, but it wasn’t the last, either. COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, was first detected in Wuhan, China, and was reported by Chinese authorities to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, 2019. On Jan. 30, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern over the coronavirus outbreak. On Jan. 31, the Trump administration announced the United States would temporarily ban the admission of people who were in China 14 days prior to their attempted travel to the United States. The restriction took effect Feb. 2, and it exempted U.S. citizens, green card holders, and certain other people. What was the rest of the world considering? We consulted Think Global Health, an initiative of the U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations that is tracking travel restrictions on China due to COVID-19. By the group’s count, Biden is correct about 45 nations restricting travel from China before the United States.That number covers variations of travel restrictions in effect up to and including Feb. 1. Think Global Health’s tracker includes partial or total land border closures, suspension of flights to and from China, visa restrictions, such as a pause on visa-on-arrival programs, and entry restrictions (similar to what the United States implemented). ""While the United States was not one of the first countries to impose restrictions against travel from China, nor was it late to do so relative to the actions of others,"" said Samantha Kiernan, a research associate at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Rather, the United States acted around the same time that many other countries did."" The Marshall Islands is among nations that had travel restrictions on China even before the World Health Organization’s Jan. 30 declaration. After the declaration, many countries, including the United States, announced their own travel restrictions. For perspective, the U.S. measure went into effect after Italy on Jan. 31 suspended all flights to and from China, but it happened before South Korea’s entry restriction that started Feb. 4. There are many ways to slice the numbers on travel restrictions, said Alex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. In a March 23 blog post, Nowrasteh estimated that at least 36 other countries imposed travel restrictions on people coming from China around the same time as the United States. ""Some countries, for instance, began forcing Chinese nationals to get a visa around this time whereas before they were allowed visa-free entry,"" Nowrasteh said. ""That’s an additional travel restriction, but a less onerous one than that imposed by President Trump."" Nowrasteh agreed that the United States’ restriction wasn’t far behind from others. ""There are many points on which to criticize the Trump administration’s response to COVID-19, but they were not slow in instituting a travel ban on China,"" Nowrasteh said. ""The real question is whether that restriction worked and there is little evidence to suggest that it did."" RELATED: Are COVID-19 travel restrictions ‘more critical in saving lives’ than testing? Not really Global health specialists told Kaiser Health News that there is little to no evidence that Trump’s restrictions restrained COVID-19, because they came too late and didn’t have the follow-up necessary to make a real dent. Research suggests that well-implemented travel restrictions can buy time, but that time has to be used effectively — to ramp up emergency preparedness and bolster activities like testing and isolating people who may have been exposed. As late as Feb. 29, the WHO advised against travel or trade restrictions related to COVID-19 outbreaks, saying: ""Travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact.""  Biden claimed that ""45 nations had already moved"" to enforce travel restrictions with China ""before the president moved."" The extent of travel restrictions vary — from the suspension of visa programs to entry denial. According to one tracker of travel restrictions, Biden’s 45 figure checks out. Other research shows that the number is around 36. Where Biden misleads is on the relative speed of the U.S. compared with others. The U.S. travel restriction came shortly after the WHO declared a public health emergency and around the same time as other nations, experts said. Biden’s statement that Trump’s travel restriction was slower than 45 other countries is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972B7C40>],/factchecks/2020/apr/13/joe-biden/joe-bidens-claim-about-donald-trumps-slow-travel-r/

Tweet amplified by Trump misleads on Fauci’s late-February advice
","President Donald Trump raised eyebrows April 12 when he retweeted a supporter who had used the hashtag #FireFauci, a reference to Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the nation’s top public health officials who has regularly joined the president on the podium in the White House press room. The tweet that Trump shared was posted by DeAnna Lorraine, a pro-Trump Republican candidate who garnered 1.8% of the vote in an all-primary challenge to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. In the primary, Lorraine finished behind Pelosi, two other Democrats and one other Republican. The tweet came hours after Fauci told CNN’s Jake Tapper that lives could have been saved if the country had ""shut everything down"" from the beginning. On April 12, Lorraine tweeted, ""Fauci is now saying that had Trump listened to the medical experts earlier he could've saved more lives. Fauci was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US public at large. Time to #FireFauci…"" Sorry Fake News, it’s all on tape. I banned China long before people spoke up. Thank you @OANN https://t.co/d40JQkUZg5 When we looked closer at Fauci’s public statements on Feb. 29, we found that Lorraine’s tweet is significantly exaggerated. (Lorraine did not respond to an inquiry.) Feb. 29 was a key moment in the course of the virus’ spread, because it was right around the time that public health officials began to suspect that the novel coronavirus had started to infect Americans through ""community spread."" Community spread means that the virus would be spreading from person to person within a particular community, rather than through cases linked to someone who had brought the virus from a known hot spot elsewhere. On Feb. 28, Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said it was possible that a reported case in California ""could be the first instance of community spread — meaning the illness was acquired through an unknown exposure in the community."" But it could also be that the patient was exposed through contact to a traveler who was infected, Messonnier said. The immediate risk to the general American public remained low, she said. The following day, a health official from Washington state, where there were four presumptive cases of COVID-19, joined a CDC press briefing and said the state was ""starting to see some spread in the community"" and the public risk was increasing. ""Should we start to see more spread in Washington, we might consider recommending measures like cancelling large public events,"" said Kathy Lofy, a Washington state health official. Fauci is interviewed on NBC's ""Today Show"" on Feb. 29 We found two televised appearances by Fauci on Feb. 29. One was an interview in the morning with Kristen Welker and Peter Alexander on NBC’s Today Show. The other was a press briefing with Trump and other officials that afternoon. On the Today Show, Fauci did say that the lack of widespread, confirmed community spread meant that it was not yet time for radical responses like shutting down large gatherings and businesses. But he did not go as far as the tweet described. He didn’t say that ""there was nothing to worry about"" or that coronavirus ""posed no threat to the U.S. public at large.""  Instead, his message was that the nation needed to remain vigilant for a possible worst-case scenario. Here are the relevant portions of that interview: Alexander: ""So, Dr. Fauci, it’s Saturday morning in America. People are waking up right now with real concerns about this. They want to go to malls and movies, maybe the gym as well. Should we be changing our habits and, if so, how?"" Fauci: ""No. Right now, at this moment, there’s no need to change anything that you’re doing on a day by day basis. Right now the risk is still low, but this could change. I’ve said that many times even on this program. You’ve got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don’t need to change anything you’re doing. When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread."" Welker: ""Dr. Fauci, quickly, how does this all end?"" Fauci: ""You know, it ends if you -- it depends on the nature of the outbreak. I mean, this could be a major outbreak. I hope not. Or it could be something that’s reasonably well controlled. At the end of the day, this will ultimately go down. Hopefully we could protect the American public from any serious degree of morbidity or mortality. That’s the reason why we’ve got to do the things that we have in our plan."" With the benefit of a month of hindsight, this may seem like a less-than-ringing endorsement of the types of social distancing policies that would soon become required far and wide. Even so, the tweet exaggerates its case. Fauci repeatedly emphasized the difference between the situation on Feb. 29 and what could happen in the future. In just this two-paragraph exchange, Fauci used the phrases, ""right now, at this moment,"" ""this could change,"" ""you’ve got to watch out,"" and ""this could be a major outbreak."" Fauci offered a similar message in the afternoon press conference. He said, ""The country as a whole, because we get asked that all the time, still remains at low risk. But when we say that, we want to underscore that this is an evolving situation, and in real time we will keep you apprised of what is going on, just the same way as we are doing it today."" Later in the briefing, Fauci said, ""We need to prepare for further challenges, and we will have them. You will hear about the additional cases that will be coming on. You should not be surprised by that, but to realize that that is something that is anticipated when you get community spread."" Lorraine tweeted that Fauci ""was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US public at large."" This is misleading. Fauci did say on Feb. 29 that rules Americans would come to know as social distancing were not yet warranted. However, just about every other sentence of his remarks was filled with caveats indicating that the situation could change. He did not indicate that there was ""nothing to worry about"" or that the virus ""posed no threat to the public.""

In coronavirus relief effort, Congress fell short on paid sick leave
","The pressure is building for Congress to pass a fourth coronavirus relief bill, beyond the roughly $2.2 trillion already approved to keep people and businesses viable during an unprecedented viral attack. And Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is making his case for what a supplemental rescue package should include ― guaranteed universal sick leave for all workers.  ""It has been estimated that only 12% of workers in businesses that are likely to stay open during this crisis are receiving paid sick leave benefits as a result of the second coronavirus relief package,"" Sanders argued in an op-ed published April 8 in The Guardian, just hours before he suspended his presidential campaign.  Paid sick leave emerged as a sticky issue on Capitol Hill as lawmakers worked to develop a federal relief package. The Families First Coronavirus Emergency Response Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law on March 18, included a guarantee of paid sick leave for some workers, which supporters say is crucial to make sure those who contract the virus are, in fact, able to stay home. The law requires companies that employ fewer than 500 people to provide two weeks of emergency sick leave if an employee develops COVID-19 symptoms, is isolating per the advice of a medical professional or is caring for a family member with a potential case of COVID-19. These employers also must provide paid family leave for people who may need to care for children during coronavirus school closures. But the law exempts bigger companies, a category that includes often-""essential"" retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Target and supermarket chains. That concession was made to satisfy the White House and congressional Republicans, many of whom have argued that most big companies already offer sick leave packages, and a federal requirement would create unnecessary red tape. Sanders’ argument is that their employees are still vulnerable. Many of the firms exempted by the law remain open during the crisis. Employees who may become ill will not be protected by the federal guarantee of sick leave. Sanders argues that many will fall through the cracks because, while their employers can choose to provide paid time off, those benefits would not fall under the federal directive and could prove less generous than what smaller firms, which must comply with the law, will provide. We contacted Sanders’ congressional office for more information but never heard back. Our research suggests that he has the big picture right, though the precise calculations are tricky. Nuances in the law make it difficult to quantify the number of people who would benefit from the relief package’s paid sick leave requirement. Sanders’ figure appears to come from an analysis conducted by The Washington Post, which suggests that ""only 12 percent of workers in businesses that are likely to stay open will be affected."" The analysis used Philadelphia’s shelter-in-place order to determine which private-sector businesses would likely stay open because it offered a clear and publicly available list of workplaces excluded from the order. Other experts validated this approach, noting that this list was a good proxy — though not a perfect one — for locations across the country. Then, the Post used data from the Census Bureau’s Statistics of U.S. Businesses (the most recent figures come from 2017) to determine how often those excluded businesses ― such as grocery stores, pharmacies, big-box stores, hardware stores, banks and dry cleaners — employed enough people to qualify for an exemption from the paid sick leave mandate. It arrived at the rate of 12%. So, first and foremost: Sanders is correct that someone had estimated this percentage. But there’s more to consider. Because of the law’s exemptions for large companies, many of the workers Americans are counting on now may not have protection. ""The workers who are on the front lines, on the grocery chains, pharmacies and warehouses, aren’t covered,"" said Vicki Shabo, a senior fellow for paid leave policy and strategy at New America, a centrist think tank. ""The businesses that continue to operate are very likely to be those that are bigger, that have the cash flows to keep their sales going and that provide essential services."" Per the Post’s analysis, those large companies employ about 7.4 million people who would likely be deemed essential workers. The law provides other exemptions, too. In interpreting the law, the Labor Department has issued regulations saying that a company with fewer than 50 employees can exempt itself from the paid family leave element of the mandate if it burdens business operations. But the new law still requires those small businesses to provide paid medical leave to their employees, a total workforce of about 2.2 million ― a factor, some policy researchers pointed out, the Post did not include in its analysis. If you redo the math counting those workers, the measure’s sick leave promise holds up a bit better — encompassing about a third of all essential workers. But there’s another catch. The law also does not guarantee paid sick leave to health care providers and emergency responders ― another category of workers typically deemed essential during a pandemic. The Labor Department defines these categories broadly. For instance, health care providers include ""workers who are needed to keep hospitals and similar health care facilities well supplied and operational,"" not only clinicians. Back-of-the-envelope math suggests that by factoring these various exemptions into the number of likely essential employees guaranteed paid sick leave under the relief package — dividing the number of essential workers who qualify for guaranteed leave by the full count of essential workers — the true percentage of people covered hovers closer to the teens. Bottom line: ""We need people to understand just how broad the exemptions ended up being,"" said Kathleen Romig, a senior analyst at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The numerous carve-outs in the federal mandate — and the benefits it requires from eligible companies ― together illuminate a larger point. Historically, American sick leave policies haven’t been uniform across industries or organizations. The new law does build on policies some businesses already had in place, Shabo said. For instance, private-sector workers who had sick leave, on average, received seven paid days a year guaranteed. The law bumps that up to 10 days (so, two workweeks for most people) and allows those days to be used to care for someone else. That’s a big change. Even so, the majority of front-line workers are not covered by the federal promise of paid leave if they fall ill during the pandemic. Many get some kind of paid sick leave. Dillon Clair, a public policy associate at the ERISA Industry Committee — which represents large employers ― said, typically the companies his organization represents offer at least 40 hours of paid sick leave, and that medical leave is accompanied by other benefits (like vacation time) that employees can use if they fall ill after exhausting their sick leave. Meanwhile, companies like Walmart and McDonald’s have rolled out emergency coronavirus programs, offering two weeks of paid time off for people the company deems sufficiently at risk. But the issue of who is deemed at risk gets dicey. Other employers, like Burger King, Dunkin’ and Marriott International, have not instituted any emergency coronavirus policies for their workers, according to New America. And the lack of standardization means that many of the voluntary leave policies have substantial holes, Shabo said. For instance, McDonald’s and Walmart both require employees to get an official quarantine recommendation or a confirmed medical diagnosis of COVID-19 to access the sick leave benefit. Those operational barriers mean people who have developed the virus are less likely to stay home — especially because coronavirus tests are sometimes difficult to come by. That influences both individual and public health. ""They’re more likely to get sick than someone like me, who is self-isolating and working from home. They are literally putting themselves at risk every time they go to work,"" Romig said. Without a guarantee of paid leave, she added, individual workers may have to choose between taking a day off to recover from illness and earning money for groceries. And there are the public implications, too. ""We really don’t want people who have contracted this virus to be in public. We don’t want them at the grocery store where everyone has to go to get food,"" she said. ""We want them out of circulation. We want them to have the income they need to sustain that."" In his op-ed, Sanders argued that ""it has been estimated that only 12% of workers in businesses that are likely to stay open during this crisis are receiving paid sick leave benefits as a result of the second coronavirus relief package."" This is true. There are different takes on the math, but when you factor in the impact of the law’s exemptions to this requirement, it still appears that the number of essential workers guaranteed paid sick leave because of this law is in the range of 12% to the low teens. More important, Sanders is correct about the big picture: Congress’ paid sick leave guarantee exempts the vast majority of front-line workers during the pandemic, which could make containing the virus harder. Sanders’ claim could use some more context, but it is generally a fair assessment. We rate it Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A40AD40>],/factchecks/2020/apr/13/bernie-sanders/sanders-coronavirus-relief-effort-congress-fell-sh/
