No, Rudy Giuliani didn’t file for Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment
","Amid ongoing speculation over whether U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will support an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, a recent Facebook post claims the tables have turned. Below a photo of former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is now Trump’s attorney, is what looks like a headline: ""Giuliani files impeachment papers for Pelosi on behalf of the White House."" Above the photo are these words: ""Wow, Giuliani filed for her impeachment, but also filed the first Public Formal Charge of TREASON. Wow, it is quite literally, HAPPENING…"" This post was published on Facebook June 20 and appears to be a screengrab of a tweet by the apparently defunct Twitter account, @Robert_QSentMe. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We found no evidence Giuliani filed for Pelosi’s impeachment and unfortunately for the nearly 200,000 people who signed a petition to the White House to impeach Pelosi, the Constitution ""gives the House of Representatives the sole power to impeach an official, and it makes the Senate the sole court,"" according to a history of impeachment on the House website.  The Constitution says that the president, vice president and civil officers of the United States ""shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.""  Individual House members can introduce impeachment resolutions like bills, or the House could initiate proceedings by passing a resolution that authorizes an impeachment inquiry. Of more than 60 impeachment proceedings, less than a third have led to full impeachments and just eight people have been convicted and removed from office by the Senate, according to Congressional impeachment history. (Those eight people were all federal judges.) Two presidents — Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton — have also been impeached. A list of all 19 people impeached by the House, and the result of those proceedings, is available here.  It appears the origin of the Facebook post is this March 18 story on Bustatroll.org, which features the same photo and headline. The first line of that story reads, ""Rudy Giuliani walked into the 1st Circuit Court of Writs today and filed Articles of Impeachment for Nancy Pelosi."" And when you click on the hyperlink the site provides for the words, ""1st Circuit Court of Writs,"" it takes you to a Google Translate page that states basically everything we know to be true about this story: ""Nope. No such thing.""  That’s because Bustatroll.org is a subsidiary of ‘America’s Last Line of Defense,"" a satirical publication.  We rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC789300>],/factchecks/2019/jun/28/viral-image/no-rudy-giuliani-didnt-file-nancy-pelosis-impeachm/

"['Gas Prices', 'Wisconsin', 'Jon Erpenbach']","
Would out-of-state drivers really pay $73 million under Evers' gas tax plan?
","Are Wisconsin drivers missing out on help from out-of-state drivers when it comes to repairing state highways? That’s the gist of a claim made by state Sen. Jon Erpenbach, D-West Point, during the debate over the state budget. He noted an increased gas tax that was proposed by Gov. Tony Evers -- and subsequently rejected by Republican lawmakers -- would bring in additional money. ""If out-of-state drivers paid (the) gas tax, they would contribute $73 million to fix our roads,"" Erpenbach tweeted June 6, 2019. Erpenbach’s tweet was prompted by action by the GOP-controlled Joint Finance Committee, which inserted its own roads funding plan inmto the budget instead of the 8-cent per gallon gas tax increase proposed by Evers.  The GOP-passed budget is now in front of Evers. So, let’s pause for a moment and look at this aspect of the debate. Are we really missing out on $73 million worth of revenue from out-of-state drivers because the Evers plan was not adopted? The background Wisconsin’s gas tax is currently 32.9 cents per gallon.  The 8-cent per gallon increase was part of a larger proposal by Evers to tie the tax to the consumer price index beginning in spring 2020. The governor also sought to raise the registration fee for heavy trucks and the fee for transferring or obtaining an original vehicle title. Instead, Republicans voted to increase title and registration fees. Under the GOP plan, the title fee, which is paid when cars are bought and sold, would increase by $95 increasing the cost from $69.50 to $164.50. Annual registration fees would rise by $10 going from $75 to $85. Finally, fees for light trucks would be set at $100 with a $25 increase for trucks weighing 4,500 pounds and a $55 cut for trucks weighing 10,000 pounds. When we reached out to Erpenbach’s office, his aide Hanna Akbik said his $73 million comment came from a conversation with the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. During a June 6, 2019 briefing, Akbik said, ""the Legislative Fiscal Bureau told Democrats that out-of-state drivers pay between 10-15% of the vehicle fuel tax revenue. The tweet was based on that information provided."" The bureau, considered the gold standard on state fiscal matters, confirmed it briefed Erpenbach and other Democrats on revenue estimates derived from the percentage of out-of-state drivers paying gas tax.  The breakdown The fiscal bureau told us the numbers they used for the revenue estimates came from the Department of Transportation and were based on 2014 data. The bureau used a range of 10% to 15% for the gas tax revenue that comes from non-Wisconsin drivers, but emphasized a median of 12%. In a separate document, the Department of Transportation noted its numbers were based on estimates.  ""The Department has no direct data that could be used to determine the amount of out-of-state consumption of motor fuel,"" the document read. ""However, based on a set of high-level assumptions about (vehicle miles traveled), fuel purchasing behavior and the amount of taxable motor vehicle fuel gallons consumed in Wisconsin in (Fiscal Year ‘14), the Department estimates that out-of-state vehicles accounted for about 12% of motor vehicle fuel tax revenue."" Checking the math  To get to $73 million, Erpenbach used the 15% level. That math does check out. If Evers’ plan were in place, the state gas tax increase would raise about $485 million for transportation projects, according to data from the Wisconsin Counties Association.  But remember: The 15% is the high end of the range. And both the DOT and fiscal bureau recommended using 12% for a more realistic projection.  At that level, the increase that would be paid by out-of-state drivers falls to about $58 million.  Our ruling Erpenbach claimed if Evers’ gas tax increase were in place, out-of-state drivers would contribute $73 million to help fix Wisconsin roads.  That’s based on the high-end of the 10% to 15% range used by the Department of Transportation. But the DOT and fiscal bureau recommend using 12% as a more reasonable figure. That puts the tally considerably lower. Our definition for Mostly True is ""The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6AD900>],/factchecks/2019/jun/28/jon-erpenbach/state-lawmakers-gas-tax-claim-gets-green-light/

"['Abortion', 'North Carolina', 'Tim Moore']","
GOP leader wrong about NC abortion law ruling
","There’s a lot of talk about abortion laws in North Carolina, and a lot of it is inaccurate. State lawmakers recently pushed for a bill that would impose new penalties on doctors who kill babies that survive an abortion. As debate swirled around the bill, which Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed, some wrongly said infants have no legal protection in those circumstances. Opponents, meanwhile, wrongly suggested that the bill would’ve directly affected women. Now, there’s confusion over when abortions are legal in North Carolina. In March, a federal court ruled that the state’s ban on women having abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy is unconstitutional. On former Gov. Pat McCrory’s June 4 radio show, House Speaker Tim Moore misrepresented the political background of the presiding judge in that case when he said ""liberal federal judges"" struck down the 20-week ban. District Judge William Osteen, who wrote the ruling, was appointed to the court by Republican President George W. Bush. Moore then suggested that the ruling greatly loosened the state’s abortion laws. ""Now in North Carolina under that law someone can get an abortion up until right before the baby is delivered,"" Moore said. Is it true that someone can now get an abortion ""up until right before the baby is delivered?"" PolitiFact has checked several claims that abortion laws would allow babies to be aborted a minute before birth or ""right up to the moment of birth."" Those were exaggerations. And Moore’s statement is too. A ‘DISINGENUOUS’ COMMENT The landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade established that women have a right to abortion up until the fetus is viable. That means women can abort a pregnancy up until the point when the fetus can live outside its mother’s womb. Or, viewed from the other side of the law, a woman cannot have an abortion after a fetus is deemed viable unless there are special circumstances. When does viability occur? Each woman and pregnancy is different. Some fetuses grow fast. Some grow more slowly. That’s why the Supreme Court ""defined viability in general terms and left it to individual physicians to apply the Supreme Court’s definition of viability to each case,"" said Katie Watson, associate professor of medical social sciences, medical education, and obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. Generally speaking, the medical community believes viability occurs sometime between 24 and 28 weeks, according to Laurie Sobel, associate director of women’s health policy for the Kaiser Family Foundation. Most pregnancies last between 37 and 40 weeks. So Moore’s claim that women can now get an abortion ""up until right before the baby is delivered"" is ""disingenuous,"" Sobel said. ""No one would say a fetus is not viable at that state,"" Sobel said. An abortion would only happen that late in pregnancy if there’s a fetal anomaly, she said. Even in those cases, she said many physicians would induce labor rather than abort the infant inside the womb. DISTRUST OF DOCTORS So, why did Moore suggest North Carolina now grants abortion until birth? Because state law doesn’t define what it means for fetuses to be viable, Moore spokesman Joseph Kyzer told PolitiFact in an email. The ruling gives physicians ""sole discretion to determine a child’s viability without any statutory definition for the term,"" Kyzer’s email said. ""In the absence of a defined statutory standard for viability, this would allow an abortionist to perform the procedure up to and during the delivery of a baby that the abortionist judges to be non-viable."" Moore’s comments through Kyzer reflect a broad distrust of medical professionals on the abortion issue among Republicans across the nation. Other GOP-controlled states such as Alabama, Louisiana and Georgia have tried to bypass those professionals and instead ban abortions after specific weeks in the pregnancy timeline. The email comments are misleading in that they ignore a legal standard that was set by Roe v. Wade. ""Moore suggests that bad situations will arise without a ‘defined statutory standard for viability.’ However, the standard he seeks is unconstitutional,"" Watson said. The judge ""correctly quoted Roe v Wade and other Supreme Court decisions that do not allow state legislatures to create their own definitions of viability."" So, Moore’s original comments, which suggested that the federal judge’s ruling changed abortion standards, are also inaccurate. Through spokeswoman Laura Brewer, Democratic NC Attorney General Josh Stein pointed out that the court ""enjoined enforcement of the statute only for pre-viability pregnancies. It doesn’t change any existing precedent or law."" OUR RULING Moore said a judge’s recent decision striking down North Carolina’s ban on abortions after 20 weeks means women can now ""get an abortion up until right before the baby is delivered."" That’s only true of fetuses with abnormalities or pregnancies that endanger the mother’s health, a standard that already existed. Moore’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

"['Health Care', 'Health Check', 'Bill de Blasio']","
Universal health care for New Yorkers? Not exactly, Bill de Blasio
","On June 26, 10 Democratic presidential candidates were asked to raise their hands if they would abolish private health insurance in favor of a government-run option. Just two said they would: Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City. But de Blasio also told viewers not to take his word for it. He has already given New York City residents ""universal health care,"" he said. Already packing for your move to the Big Apple? First, let’s take a look at the facts. De Blasio highlighted this claim at the end of the first Democratic presidential debate, as he argued voters should look past the talking points of his two dozen or so Democratic competitors and consider what he has done during his more than five years as mayor. ""It matters that we nominate a candidate who saw the destruction wrought by a broken health care system and gave people universal health care,"" de Blasio said. He also cited New York City’s $15 minimum wage and universal prekindergarten program. ""These things really matter,"" he said. ""And these are the things that I've done in New York, and I want to do the same for this whole country, because putting working people first, it matters."" Support for universal health care has emerged as an early test for many zealous primary voters of how authentically progressive a Democratic candidate is. So, how does de Blasio measure up? Did he really give people ""universal health care""? We asked the de Blasio campaign, and a spokeswoman pointed to the mayor’s ""Guaranteed Care"" commitment to ensure every New Yorker has health care, a plan he unveiled in January. De Blasio said at the time that the two-part plan, estimated to cost $100 million, would bolster the city’s public health insurance option, known as MetroPlus — including efforts to enroll more people who qualify but are not yet insured. It also ""guarantees"" access to the city’s system of public hospitals and clinics for those who are ineligible for insurance. The word ""ineligible"" refers in particular to those who cannot afford insurance or cannot enroll because they are undocumented immigrants. The mayor’s office estimated in May that there are 300,000 New Yorkers who fit the bill. A new program at the heart of the plan, called NYC Care, aims to help the ineligible. Those who are uninsured — and have lived in New York City for at least six months — would be connected with a primary care doctor; access to a variety of specialty care, including mental health and substance abuse services; affordable prescription drugs; and a 24/7 customer service number, which they can call to make appointments. Services would be charged on a sliding scale. But NYC Care is not an insurance plan. And as of June 27, the city’s public health system — NYC Health + Hospitals — advises visitors to its website that ""beginning summer 2019, there will be various ways you can sign up."" De Blasio’s claim was ""very misleading,"" said Bill Hammond, the health policy director at the Empire Center for Public Policy, a nonpartisan, New York-focused think tank. Voters might think he is referring to universal insurance or even a single-payer system, he said, neither of which is true. What de Blasio is giving New Yorkers are new ways to access existing services, Hammond said. And while it may be a good thing, he said, it looks more like ""reconfiguring."" Not only has New York City had MetroPlus and a mammoth system of public hospitals and other medical facilities for years, it has long been a mission of NYC Health + Hospitals to treat those who cannot afford care, including undocumented immigrants, he said. ""He’s making it sound like he passed ‘Medicare for All’ in New York City,"" Hammond said. ""And he didn’t even come close."" Further complicating de Blasio’s claim is his use of past-tense — that he ""gave"" New Yorkers universal health care. The plan is expected to be rolled out over time, beginning with the Bronx and encompassing all five boroughs by the end of 2020. (It was originally slated to be ""fully available"" in 2021, but by the time de Blasio announced his presidential run in mid-May, that date had been moved up.) NYC Care is expected to launch in the Bronx on Aug. 1. Our ruling De Blasio said he gave New Yorkers universal health care. According to the World Health Organization, ""universal health coverage"" means anyone can use the health services they need, of a good enough quality to be effective, without being exposed to financial hardship. To be sure, de Blasio unveiled a plan in January that includes a new program that aims to give anyone (who has lived in New York City for at least six months) access to New York’s renowned public health system at a price tailored to their financial situation. But for the most part, de Blasio did not create a new system so much as make sure New Yorkers can use the one they have — and it remains to be seen how well his methods will work. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. So we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD6C480>],/factchecks/2019/jun/27/bill-de-blasio/universal-health-care-new-yorkers-not-exactly/
"['Health Care', 'Health Check', 'John Delaney']","
John Delaney’s debate claim that ‘Medicare for All’ will shutter hospitals is unsubstantiated
","At the first Democratic presidential primary debate, former Rep. John Delaney (Md.) outlined his opposition to ""Medicare for All"" and focused on one potential loser: hospitals. ""If you go to every hospital in this country and you ask them one question, which is, ‘How would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the Medicare rate?’ Every single hospital administrator said they would close,"" he said. This is a variation on a common industry talking point. Hospitals say that Medicare for All would mean serious revenue cuts for them. In turn, they argue, it would drive many to close. Still, Delaney’s claim — which got a fair bit of traction online and in post-debate news coverage — piqued our interest. Would ""every single"" hospital close? Has someone actually asked ""every hospital in the country""? We decided to dig in. Delaney’s staff told us his talking point came from three sources. First: the fact Medicare pays hospitals on average 87 cents for every dollar of costs. Second: a federal report suggesting that ""more than two-thirds of hospitals are losing money on Medicare inpatient services."" Third: Delaney, his staff said, ""has been asking this question at the rural hospitals he has visited over the course of the campaign."" Experts we spoke with offered a different take — mainly, that his evidence is not strong enough to support his claim. In addition, they told us that the potential impact of Medicare for All on hospitals would be much more nuanced — it is not at all clear that ""every single hospital"" would close, and while some would do worse, some might do better. Different hospitals, different effects ""It really depends on which hospitals you’re talking about,"" said Gerard Anderson, a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University and an expert in hospital pricing. Hospitals that treat a large number of uninsured patients — people who arguably would gain coverage under a Medicare for All approach — would probably increase their revenue under the new system because they would no longer face the financial pressure of uncompensated care. But hospitals that treat many privately insured patients, for whom insurance rates are often negotiated in a favorable manner, would see their revenues decline. Economists are quick to point out that the latter scenario isn’t necessarily bad. American health care spending is notoriously higher than that of other developed countries. Research suggests that hospitals, particularly those with lots of influence or market power, are among the key drivers of these high costs because they are able to negotiate much higher rates with insurers.  That said — would those hospitals that took a financial hit under a Medicare for All approach close immediately? Again, it’s hard to say. But such a dramatic turn isn’t likely, hospital researchers said. For one thing, many hospitals that rely on private insurance could cut elsewhere first, noted Robert Berenson, a health policy analyst at the Urban Institute. ""They have high staffing ratios, generous salaries, engage in capital expansion and have billions in reserves from ‘retained earnings,’"" Berenson argued. ""The reserves alone would forestall bankruptcy for some time.""  Additionally, under the new system, hospitals would not be operating in a vacuum. Costs and incentives across the entire health industry would change, too. Then, what about those rural hospitals Delaney’s staff mentioned? To be sure, these hospitals have in recent years faced serious financial difficulties. Across the country, more than 100 have closed since 2010, according to data from the University of North Carolina’s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research. (Indeed, one of the few policy fixes that has alleviated some of the financial strain is health insurance expansion through the Affordable Care Act.) ""We’re so focused right now on keeping rural hospitals open and dealing with declining life expectancy, that we haven’t engaged"" with Medicare for All debates, said Alan Morgan, chief executive officer of the National Rural Health Association. But analyzing the impact is tricky. On one hand, Morgan said, rural hospitals often operate on tighter budgets — and lower government payments without private cash could exacerbate the challenge. But on the other, rising bad debt among rural hospitals, which often treat high levels of uninsured patients, means coverage expansions could be welcome, especially if Congress paid rural hospitals at a separate, enhanced rate. ""We’re not at a point where there’s detail yet to know,"" Morgan said. But even under Medicare for All, Anderson noted, special government programs and designations specifically designed to keep rural hospitals afloat would kick in. Although some may operate on limited revenues currently, he said, those programs would continue to exist for those that qualify. And each hospital has a unique financial situation, said Linda Blumberg, a health policy fellow at the Urban Institute. So, she said, imagining how rural hospitals as a whole may fare requires complex modeling, analysis and prediction. ""The variation here can’t be understated. It’s tremendous,"" she said. Medicare vs. Medicare for All Delaney’s claim also misses another point. The Medicare for All bill sponsored by fellow Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) doesn’t actually say hospitals would be paid at Medicare rates. It’s entirely possible — and indeed likely — that hospitals with large private revenue margins would make less money under a single-payer system. But, again, Delaney seems to oversimplify the situation. The current Medicare for All bill in Congress delegates to the federal government the task of setting up a payment schedule for hospitals and doctors. Politically, Anderson argued, the odds are ""quite low"" that the government would decide to pay all hospitals the current Medicare rates for all services, though it would set a lower price than what many private plans now pay. How does this work in practice? There’s one example in Delaney’s own backyard: Maryland has what’s called ""all-payer rate setting,"" in which the state sets what hospitals can charge for certain services. Maryland’s approach, which was first implemented in 1977 and continues to be modified, has ultimately helped limit spending growth for individual hospital admissions. And, notably, this price setting hasn’t been a death blow to the state’s hospitals. Still, a major (and consequential) change Analysts noted that Delaney is getting at something real, and important. Medicare for All would represent a seismic change for hospitals. Figuring out how to pay them would be complicated and must be done carefully. ""It is not easy — it’s not a wave of the hand to fix this,"" Blumberg said. After all, any government single-payer plan would likely pay less than private plans do. And, economists argue, it should, if policymakers are serious about bringing down health care costs. But that means switching over would require a ""long transition period"" to prevent major disruption to how hospitals function, and how people get care, Berenson said. ""Many hospitals are overpaid — substantially — but they need time and a structured approach to get down to Medicare or Medicare +10% rates,"" Berenson said. Our ruling Delaney said that ""if you go to every hospital in this country and you ask them one question, which is, ‘How would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the Medicare rate?’ Every single hospital administrator said they would close."" But Delaney has not gone ""to every hospital in the country,"" so he cannot say what ""every single hospital administrator"" would claim. No researcher has done this. The evidence for his claim is also lacking. Medicare does pay less than private plans, but it is not at all clear that under Medicare for All every hospital would be paid the Medicare rate. It is also not clear that hospitals would be affected the same way. Some might close their doors, but some might see their margins improve. This statement is not accurate, and lacks evidence to support it. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB115440>],/factchecks/2019/jun/27/john-delaney/delaneys-debate-claim-medicare-all-will-shutter-ho/

And I’ve heard from a number of you in this room about how the volume of illegal crossings is now overwhelming infrastructure, overwhelming the ability of the communities to absorb that much population coming in."" Cruz repeated his claim about apprehension figures in a statement later that same day, after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced that he would deploy 1,000 Texas National Guard  troops to the border. ""In May, the Border Patrol apprehended over 144,000 individuals – and if that pace continues, we’re looking at nearly 2 million apprehensions in a single year,"" Cruz said in the statement. We decided to fact-check these figures. Let’s dive in. Cruz conflates apprehensions, ‘inadmissibles’ First, we’ll look at Cruz’s claim that federal agents have ""apprehended over 144,000 people in a single month."" Maria Jeffrey, a spokeswoman for Cruz, directed us to an article from U.S. News and World Report titled, ""Arrests at Southern Border Jumped to 144,000 in May.""  She also shared a link to data from Customs and Border Patrol with migration statistics from the southern border. A chart accompanying the data shows that in May, there were 144,278 people apprehended or deemed inadmissible at the U.S.-Mexico border — the highest monthly total this fiscal year, the timeframe CBP uses to analyze apprehension data.  The problem here is that this figure includes both apprehensions and ‘inadmissibles,’ people who attempt to enter the country legally at ports of entry but were unable to enter. This could include people ""presenting themselves to seek humanitarian protection,"" people who were seeking lawful admission but didn’t meet the requirements, and people who ultimately withdrew their application for admission and returned to their countries of origin. These individuals are not taken into custody at the border, but instead are turned away — the U.S. News and World Report story is wrong to count them in the same category as apprehensions. (It’s also wrong to categorize all apprehensions as arrests, since CBP defines apprehension as ""the physical control or temporary detainment of a person who is not lawfully in the U.S. which may or may not result in an arrest."") In May, 11,391 people attempted to enter the country through ports of entry and were deemed inadmissible. This included 6,799 single adults, 4,124 family units, 386 unaccompanied children and 72 accompanied minors.  The actual number of apprehensions at the southern border in May was 132,887, which included 84,542 family units, 36,838 single adults and 11,507 unaccompanied children. Cruz’s estimate ignores other factors The second part of Cruz’s statement looks at projected apprehensions. He said if apprehensions continue at the volume they did in May for the next 12 months, it would ""put us on a pace for nearly 2 million apprehensions on the border."" If we look at the 144,000 figure offered by Cruz and multiply it by 12, it would translate to more than 1.7 million apprehensions over the next year. Jeffrey confirmed that this is how Cruz calculated his estimate.  ""And yes, 144,000 x 12 is 1,728,000 – so nearly 2 million,"" she wrote in an email.  While Cruz’s math is right, experts said that this is not an accurate way to estimate apprehensions.  ""People who know the border well are aware that apprehensions typically follow seasonal patterns, so taking what in most years is the highest month of the year for apprehensions and multiplying by 12 will get you a rate well in excess of yearly totals,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute, in an email. Data shows that June apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border have been lower than those in May during every fiscal year since 2000 — with the exception of 2017. But relying on seasonal patterns could still give an inaccurate estimate of future apprehensions, due to the changing demographics of migrants.  Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Research Center, said the current influx of migrants is largely from Central America and includes significant numbers of families and children ""who are turning themselves in to the Border Patrol with the intention of claiming asylum."" Historic migration patterns at the southern border were driven by a different population group. ""For most of the (data on seasonal migration patterns), well over 95% of the apprehensions were Mexicans (mostly men), people coming to work in agriculture or other seasonal work,"" Passel said. ""Thus, models built on the historical apprehensions probably are not applicable to the current situation."" But Cruz’s methodology for estimating future apprehensions isn’t better. Mittelstadt said Cruz could come up with a more accurate estimate if he used existing data to estimate future flows, instead of relying on figures from one month. This would account for monthly fluctuations and include data from both low and high months.  ""We’d be reluctant to undertake any such exercise, though, without noting how dynamic conditions are at the border right now,"" she said, pointing to changing policies at the border and the deployment of Mexican troops to the country’s northern border. Since the start of the fiscal year (October), federal agents have made 593,507 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. More than 65% were people in a family unit or unaccompanied children. Looking at the calendar year, there have been 439,895 apprehensions at the southern border, with more than 67% being people in a family unit or unaccompanied children. Néstor Rodríguez, a sociology professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies migration, also said in an email that the best way to estimate future apprehensions takes a variety of factors into account, including seasonal fluctuations and ""variables such as conditions of unemployment and crime levels in home countries and local settings.""  Our ruling Cruz said, ""As you know, we apprehended over 144,000 people in a single month. That is a pace, which if it continues for 12 months, would put us on a pace for nearly 2 million apprehensions on the border."" Cruz’s assessment of the number of apprehensions includes figures for people who presented themselves to federal officials at ports of entry who were then ""deemed inadmissible."" These individuals are turned back and are typically not taken into custody.  The second part of his statement offered an estimate for future apprehensions based on those figures. Changing demographics at the border make it tricky to estimate future flows, but experts agreed that Cruz’s estimate (144,000 x 12) is far from accurate, since it doesn’t take any other variables into account. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA699C0>],/factchecks/2019/jun/27/ted-cruz/fact-checking-ted-cruz-apprehensions-us-mexico-bor/
"['Debt', 'Education', 'Vermont', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Sanders’ latest claim about college costs only applies to public universities
","As the first debate of the Democratic primary approaches, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., announced his policy proposal to cancel student debt. Outside the U.S. Capitol on Monday, Sanders outlined his plan to cancel $1.6 trillion in student loans by levying a tax on Wall Street financial transactions. During the announcement, the Vermont senator used an old stump speech favorite — that university in the U.S. was mostly tuition-free throughout the 20th century — but with an addendum.  Sanders said that a federal financial assistance program for low income students, which unlike loans does not need to be paid back, covered almost the entire cost of college back in the late 1970s.  ""Forty years ago, a federal Pell grant paid for nearly 80% of tuition, fees, room and board at a four-year college,"" Sanders said. Sanders went on to say that though the Pell grant no longer comes close to covering the costs of college, his student debt forgiveness proposal would give the financial assistance grant a significant boost. That made us wonder – did Pell grants really cover nearly the entire cost of attending college four decades ago? We reached out to the Sanders campaign as well as several higher education finance experts to find out.  A spokesperson for the Sanders campaign referred us to a 2017 policy brief from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank that studies federal and state budget policies. In that analysis, the authors write that in 2017 ""Pell (covered) just 29 percent of the average costs of tuition, fees, room, and board at public four-year colleges"" which was ""its lowest level in more than 40 years and far below the 79 percent it covered in 1975."" Spiros Protopsaltis, an author of the brief and an associate professor of education policy at George Mason University, said he believes Sanders’ statement to be accurate.  Protopsaltis explained that in 1975 the average cost of tuition, fees and room and board at a four-year public institution was $1,779, according to College Board data compiled by the authors. The maximum Pell grant that year was  $1,400 — or 79% of the total cost. Donald Heller, the provost and vice president of Academic Affairs at the University of San Francisco, who has researched higher education finance, agrees with what Sanders said Monday – with one important caveat.  Protopsaltis’ analysis, showing the grants covering 80% of college costs, only applies to public universities, not private institutions. ""That’s an important distinction, because it covered less of the cost of a private four-year college or university,"" Heller said. According to College Board data shared by Protopsaltis, the maximum Pell grant in 1975 would have only covered about 38% of the total cost of attendance at a private, four-year nonprofit school, where the average cost of tuition, fees, room and board averaged $3,682.  That’s important to keep in mind. Because the high cost of college, where public higher education is concerned, is also tied to deep funding cuts state governments have made to their college systems. ""It’s not just that Pell has been completely disinvested in. A big portion of that driver is that states have disinvested as well, which has driven tuition up,"" said Wesley Whistle, a senior adviser at New America’s education policy program Sanders said that 40 years ago a ""federal Pell grant paid for nearly 80% of tuition, fees, room and board at a four-year college."" While this is accurate for public four-year colleges, it is not true of private four-year institutions. Based on the data the Vermont senator cited for his statement, a Pell grant would only cover 38% of the cost of a private university in the late 1970s — well off the nearly 80% of costs Sanders says the grants covered at a ""four-year college."" While Sanders statement is accurate, it leaves out the important context that this number refers only to four-year public college. We rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC74EF40>],/factchecks/2019/jun/26/bernie-sanders/sanders-latest-claim-about-college-costs-only-appl/

No, police are not warning the public about gangs throwing eggs on windshields
","Fake warnings on social media are usually vague and incomplete, but one recently shared on Facebook (again) is oddly specific. The post says that police are warning people not to use their windshield wipers if eggs are thrown at their car. Why? The posts say it is a scam to reduce their view of the road, exposing them to danger. The full post claims: ""OFFICIAL MSG FROM POLICE: If you are driving at night and eggs are thrown at your windshield do not stop to check the car, do not operate the wiper and do not spray any water, because eggs mixed with water becomes milky and block your vision up to 92.5%, and you are then forced to stop beside the road and become a victim of these criminals. This is a new technique used by gangs, so please inform your friends and relatives. And most importantly do not be selfish and refuse to share this message."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No, this is not a widespread problem that ""police"" are warning people about; it’s one of those mass-shared hoaxes that refuses to go away. This warning started as an email chain in 2009. Different versions have sometimes pinpointed a location where these robberies or car-nappings were supposedly happening, and were mostly places located outside of the United States such as Lebanon, Malaysia, India or other parts of Asia. Despite the rumor’s long shelf life, we searched Nexis news archives and could find no law enforcement or media reports of such incidents in the United States. We did, however, come across a similar, isolated incident that occurred on June 23, 2019, (three days after this post was shared on Facebook) in east Delhi, India. According to news reports, broadcast journalist Mitali Chandola was shot in the hand while sitting in her vehicle at a stoplight after eggs were thrown at her windshield. The real-world incident diverges from the steps detailed in this viral and persistent warning, however, in that Chandola wasn’t harmed after pulling over to wipe the eggs off. According to the news reports, the shooting happened immediately after the eggs were thrown. We could also find no evidence that ""eggs mixed with water becomes milky and block(s) your vision up to 92.5%."" After the email chain started to spread, the Decatur (Ala.) Daily newspaper decided to test the claim in 2009. ""After smashing the eggs on the driver's side of the windshield, a thick, clear film covered the glass. Instantly spraying the glass with fluid and turning on the wipers removed most of the residue. Although making a mess, the eggs would not force a driver to immediately pull off to the side of the road because of reduced visibility."" We even found a YouTuber who tested the claim on video, using his wipers and windshield spray to try to clean up the mess of multiple broken eggs during daylight and night, and found, to quote him, ""This is not a problem, not an issue.""

Is Wisconsin a Top 10 state for health care coverage?
","Health care remains a political flashpoint in Wisconsin, with the refusal by Republicans to accept federal Medicaid dollars drawing constant criticism from Gov. Tony Evers and other Democrats. But former Republican Gov. Scott Walker says Wisconsin’s health care system is already in great shape. While debating socialism on Twitter with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential contender from Vermont, Walker touted his accomplishments as governor. ""Under Democrat control of the state, WI had a waiting list for healthcare coverage under Medicaid. I eliminated the waiting list and everyone living in poverty is now covered,"" Walker said in a May 30, 2019, tweet. ""WI is a Top 10 state for healthcare coverage."" We’re going to focus on the last part of that — is Wisconsin really a top state nationally for health care coverage? This is not the first claim in this vein for Walker. We gave him a Mostly False rating in August 2017 for claiming Wisconsin moved from the Bottom 10 to Top 10 states for business. Many organizations do such ratings, but only one prominent one listed Wisconsin that high. In this case, Walker’s claim is a little narrower, referring not to health care in general, but health care coverage. There is no shortage of rankings for health care, each with its own methodology and focus. Many organizations try to gauge overall health care quality, but we found three well-respected national groups that addressed coverage or access more specifically. * The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit think tank focusing on national health issues, used U.S. Census Bureau data to identify the number of uninsured people by state. Wisconsin was tied for sixth-best in the country with 5% of the population uninsured in 2017. * The latest U.S. News & World Report health care ranking slotted Wisconsin eighth for health care access based on child wellness visits, health insurance enrollment, adult wellness visits, adult dental visits, child dental visits and health care affordability. Access was one of three factors in the overall state health care system ranking the publication generates. * The Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that seeks to improve health care access and quality, ranked Wisconsin 11th for access and affordability on its 2018 Scorecard on State Health System Performance. The ranking is based on rates of insurance coverage for various age groups, out-of-pocket expenses and other cost-related barriers to care. As a quick aside, we’ll note Wisconsin’s overall health care system drew fairly high marks as well among the various rankings — though not always in the Top 10. U.S. News & World Report ranked the Wisconsin health care system 14th overall, the Commonwealth Fund ranked the state eighth and the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality listed Wisconsin in the Top 12 without a specific rank.  Two other companies that compile rankings on various subjects also examined healthcare: SmartAsset combined metrics to rank Wisconsin sixth, while Wallethub’s data compilation landed Wisconsin 23rd. Walker said Wisconsin is a Top 10 state for health care coverage. The latest raw data on percentage covered shows 95% of Wisconsin residents have health insurance, which is tied for sixth-best in the country. Two other prominent national rankings list Wisconsin eighth and 11th in combined metrics that examine coverage and healthcare access. We rate Walker’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7D7200>],/factchecks/2019/jun/25/scott-walker/wisconsin-top-10-state-health-care-coverage/

","Kathy Barnette, the sudden contender for the Republican nomination in Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate race, was shown one of her tweets during a television interview days before the state’s May 17 primary. The tweet wasn’t visible to viewers, but it was displayed on the phone of NBC News reporter Dasha Burns.  Burns showed her phone to Barnette and said: ""I mean, this tweet says: ‘Pedophilia is a cornerstone of Islam.’"" Barnette said: ""Yeah, no, I don’t think that’s me. I would never have said that,"" according to a clip of the interview posted on YouTube.   ""OK, I would have never said that, because I don't believe that,"" Barnette added, according to a longer version of her reply posted on NBCNews.com. But Barnette did post what Burns said she did. Here is what Barnette tweeted from her verified Twitter account on April 10, 2015: ""Pedophilia is a Cornerstone of Islam ⋆ UFP NEWS http://fb.me/2zuiyNeXH""  Pedophilia is a Cornerstone of Islam ⋆ UFP NEWS http://t.co/PmuXZE7h80 The tweet is still live. The link in Barnette’s tweet is not active. But an archived link shows that two days before her tweet, the link went to that headline on UniversalFreePress.com, also known as UFP News. The article under that headline claimed that child molestation is widespread throughout the Muslim world. UFPNews.com ""provides conservative patriots who love liberty a different perspective on government, politics and world news,"" according to the ZoomInfo database. Barnette’s campaign did not reply to our emails requesting comment. Barnette has made other anti-Muslim statements. In a speech uploaded to YouTube in 2015, Barnette said, ""The mindset of a Muslim is very different from the mindset of Americans, and that’s the reason why we cannot fully understand the depth of the depravity, the depth of the evil."" She said Islam is a ""worldview"" as well as a religion, and ""we have a right to discriminate against worldviews. We discriminated against Hitler’s Nazi Germany view of the world, right?"" Barnette tweeted in 2015: ""There is nothing rational about Islam."" Axios reported on several other anti-Muslim tweets by Barnette, including posts critical of former President Barack Obama that falsely called him a Muslim. In an interview May 15, 2022, Fox News host Shannon Bream asked Barnette about her tweets about Islam, though not about the pedophilia tweet specifically. Barnette said the tweets were ""not even full thoughts."" ""Let me just say in almost all of those tweets, especially when you look at the time frame we were living in at that particular time, we had the Obama administration bringing in a lot of Syrian refugees at that time,"" Barnette said.  ""The overwhelming majority of the tweets that are now being presented are not even full thoughts,"" Barnette added. ""So I can't provide a lot of context because, again, it's almost 10 years ago. That's how far they have to go back to try to find anything on me."" Dr. Mehmet Oz, another candidate for the GOP nomination, told the Associated Press that Barnette’s tweet is ""disqualifying.""

Though many Americans live paycheck to paycheck, some posts inflate the stat
","Faced with increasing prices for groceries and other necessities due to rising inflation, Americans are paying careful attention to their bank accounts.  And while some may not have much financial security, a social media post paints things as more dire than they are. ""Most Americans’ average income is $3,200 per pay period, per paycheck. $3,200 a month,"" said a woman in a TikTok video that was shared to Facebook on April 28. ""So we have 76% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck, meaning they are one paycheck away from poverty."" A text overlay on the video also claimed that ""76% of Americans are one paycheck from poverty.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, meaning the money they make each pay period is used on necessary expenses such as rent, groceries or health care without additional savings. But the video on Facebook inflates the most recent available data. The video itself gives numbers for income that are well above the poverty line. The federal poverty line in 2022, which is used to determine eligibility for certain federal programs and benefits is $13,590 for a single individual or $27,750 for a family of four. A person making $3,200 a month would have an annual income of $38,400 — well above the federal poverty line for a single individual. That income would only be below the federal poverty guideline if it were supporting a household of seven. The median household income in the U.S. is $64,994 per year, and the average income is $91,547 annually, according to 2020 census data. Based on those values, the claim that the average American earns $3,200 per month is incorrect. It appears the ""paycheck to paycheck"" claim from the video might come from a 2013 survey released by Bankrate.com, a personal finance website. That survey found that 76% of Americans were living paycheck to paycheck with little or no money saved for emergencies, according to CNN Money.  PolitiFact found more current statistics that report a smaller number — but the meaning of ""paycheck to paycheck"" can also depend on the survey. A January survey conducted by MagnifyMoney, a website about personal finance, found that 50% of Americans say they live paycheck to paycheck and have no money left after all their expenses are paid. An additional 15% of Americans say it varies. An October 2020 survey conducted by Highland Solutions, a digital product consultant, found that 63% of Americans said they had been living paycheck to paycheck since the onset of the pandemic.  In December 2021, PYMNTS and LendingClub reported that 61% of American consumers were living paycheck to paycheck, which was an increase of 7% since May 2021. In that report, those living paycheck to paycheck were further divided into two categories: 39% reported they were able to pay their bills easily, while 22% said they struggled to cover their expenses each month. Gary Burtless, an economist and senior fellow at The Brookings Institution, cautioned that the phrase ""living paycheck to paycheck"" has no precise definition. For example, people can report they live ""paycheck to paycheck"" even if they’re making high salaries, depending on how responsibly they manage their finances and what they’ve deemed as necessary expenses. ""I would be skeptical of statistics that are based on this concept, unless there is a very clear definition with a precise link to hard facts about the relationship between a family’s monthly income sources and its basic consumption needs,"" he said. Burtless pointed to the December 2021 survey that found 42% of people making more than $100,000 a year reported living paycheck to paycheck. With that in mind, he said he was ""reasonably confident that a sizeable percentage of folks ‘living paycheck to paycheck’ own the home they live in, have accumulated some savings in a retirement plan, and live fairly comfortable lives compared with that of their grandparents’ generation."" As for the question of whether living paycheck to paycheck can be accurately summarized as being ""one paycheck away from poverty,"" Burtless said that’s complicated. If, for example, a household relies solely or overwhelmingly on the after-tax income of one breadwinner who quits or is dismissed from their job for cause, that household may indeed be just one paycheck away from poverty, he said.  In most states, a person who quits or is fired from a job for cause is ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits.  Burtless said in that situation, many families could be eligible for other assistance such as ""food stamps, Medicaid insurance, and perhaps a modest allotment of cash public assistance, but a sizable percentage will find the combined income from these programs will leave the family with a below-poverty-line income."" People who lose their jobs in a typical layoff are often entitled to up to six months of unemployment insurance that can help keep a person out of poverty, Burtless said. And many households have an additional breadwinner who can help keep a family out of poverty.  A video shared on Facebook claimed that ""76% of Americans (are) living paycheck to paycheck, meaning they are one paycheck away from poverty."" Different surveys yield different figures, but PolitiFact found no recent data that put the figure as high as 76%. It’s possible the TikTok user pulled the statistic from a 2013 survey. More recent data shows that somewhere between 50% to 63% of Americans report living ""paycheck to paycheck,"" but there is no clear cut definition for that phrase, which makes the concept difficult to quantify.  We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC909A00>],/factchecks/2022/may/16/facebook-posts/though-many-americans-live-paycheck-paycheck-some-/

Social media users wrong to suggest Megan Thee Stallion wasn’t shot
","Social media continues to be a source of misinformation about a high-profile case where one rapper is charged with shooting another. On May 11, multiple Facebook users shared the same image post that suggests Megan Thee Stallion was not shot, but had stepped on glass. ""Dr. Loffredo, who treated Megan Thee Stallion, confirmed her foot was wounded due to her stepping on glass,"" says the Facebook post. It includes photos of Megan and Tory Lanez, who is charged with shooting Megan in 2020. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The information appears to have originated with a police report allegedly from the Los Angeles Police Department, published this month by celebrity news site Mob Radio. The LAPD did not respond to our email inquiring whether the police report is authentic. The screenshot of the police report says after a July 2020 altercation, Megan — identified in the report by her real last name, Pete — ""was transported to Cedars Sinai and was treated by Dr. Loffredo for lacerations to her left foot. Dr. Loffredo confirmed laceration due to stepping on glass."" Dr. Anthony Loffredo is an emergency medicine doctor at Cedars-Sinai, according to the hospital’s website. We did not find any public statements from Loffredo about the case. But the information in that report is consistent with what Megan has said publicly about the timeline of events. On the day of the altercation, Megan told police and doctors that her injury came from stepping on broken glass, according to reports from a December 2021 hearing in the case. She later said she had been shot, and a more detailed medical report from the day of the altercation shows that there are bullet fragments in her foot, CBS and Page Six reported. Lanez is charged with assault with a semi-automatic firearm in connection with the shooting, and prosecutors have said they believe the evidence substantially supports the charges. The shooting has been the source of conflicting information from the start. In July 2020, Megan attended a party with Lanez, and later that night, Megan was shot. Initially, Los Angeles police did not name a suspect, explain Megan’s injuries in detail or confirm whether the injuries were gunshot wounds, The New York Times reported in July 2020. In October 2020, Lanez was charged in connection with the shooting. Megan explained in an April 2022 interview with Gayle King that she first told police she stepped on glass because she was worried after the murder of George Floyd what the police might do if they found out someone had a gun.  ""Surveillance footage of the arrest shows Lanez, the unidentified woman, and later Megan lying spread-eagled on the ground near the vehicle, surrounded by multiple police cars with a helicopter hovering overhead,"" NBC News reported in October 2020. It’s not the first time false information has circulated on social media in an attempt to cast doubt on Megan’s account. In February, we debunked a claim that it had been revealed in court that Lanez’ DNA was not found on the weapon. Facebook posts suggest Megan Thee Stallion was not a shooting victim but had stepped on glass.

Finland’s NATO membership is not final
","A recent Facebook post warns that World War III is looming ""as Finland joins NATO.""  On May 15, Finland’s prime minister and president announced that the country will apply to join NATO in response to Russia invading Ukraine.  But Finland hasn’t joined NATO yet, and Turkey has voiced concerns about the country doing so.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Finland’s parliament still must vote on whether to join NATO, but it’s considered a formality because a majority of lawmakers favor it.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, meanwhile, said on May 13 that Turkey is ""not favorable"" toward Finland joining NATO.  The following day, an adviser to Erdogan told Reuters, ""We are not closing the door. But we are basically raising the issue as a matter of national security for Turkey."" NATO makes all decisions by consensus.  If Finland formally applies for membership, as is expected, leaders from other countries have advocated for a quick accession to the military alliance. It could then take around six months for member countries to ratify the accession protocol, NPR reported. The statement in this post that Finland has joined NATO contains an element of truth — the country has said it plans to apply — but it ignores critical facts. Finland has not yet formally applied to join NATO, and Turkey could block its membership. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said Turkey has made it clear that’s not its intention.   We rate this post Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB68900>],/factchecks/2022/may/16/facebook-posts/finlands-nato-membership-not-final/

Fact-checking warnings that NewProfilePic app is Russian spyware
","A new phone app is making waves on social media as people use it to recreate their selfies into caricatures of themselves.   But according to a rising number of claims, the NewProfilePic app is bad news. ""GUYS! If you’ve downloaded the new app fad going around making your pictures into characters DELETE IT!"" one Facebook post warned. ""You’re giving it permission to have access to your cards, any banking information on your phone, contacts, etc. It’s from a Russian based company and there are already reports of them wiping out bank accounts.""  That post, along with others, quickly spread on social media, and the Daily Mail also reported on the claim. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  But those rumors don’t paint the right picture — the app isn’t sending your information to Russia. Here’s how you can tell.  NewProfilePic was created by a mobile development group called Informe Laboratories Inc., and copyrighted by Linerock Investments Ltd., said Kristina Lunina, a Linerock Investments spokesperson. The app is available on Google Play and the Apple App Store. We looked at the app’s permissions in both stores — neither of them state that the app accesses people’s banking or contact information. When we clicked on the app’s privacy policy for both Google and Apple, we were directed to Linerock Investments’ website. The privacy policy lists what their apps can access. Contrary to the claim, it doesn’t include banking information or contacts. ""We collect your name, email address, user name, social network information and other information you provide when you register, set up an account, contact us by email or use our services,"" Linerock Investment Ltd. states. ""We may also obtain information from other companies and combine that with the information we collect on the Services.""  We tested and explored NewProfilePic for ourselves. Here’s how it works: Once users download and open the app, it asks whether they'd like to try a three-day trial for its pro version, which costs $29.99. Users can bypass that and head to the app’s home screen, which includes a ""choose photo"" button.  The app then asks for permission to access photos and media on the device. People can select which photos they want to turn into cartoons, and the app will generate those images into caricatures.    Lunina said the app’s permissions aren’t much different from those on Instagram or TikTok. We found that’s true, except for a key difference — TikTok and Instagram both ask for permission to access people’s contact lists to connect users with their friends on the apps.  In a word, no. Lunina explained that all user photos are hosted and processed on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure servers, which are in the United States.  The app’s developers do have some ties to Russia, but not as extensive as some have claimed. Linerock’s headquarters are based in the British Virgin Islands, and they have development offices in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Snopes reported that the company’s domain was formerly registered in Moscow, but now, it’s registered in Florida.  Lunina said the domain address in Moscow was registered to the former address of Victor Sazhin, the founder of Linerock. ""He does not live in the Russian Federation now,"" she wrote in an email to PolitiFact. ""Currently, the address was changed in order to avoid any confusion."" Sazhin wrote in an Instagram post of his own Russian and Ukrainian heritage, noting that the company’s team consists of people from both countries.  ""We understand that due to the current events in Ukraine, any connection to Russia could raise suspicions,"" Lunina said. ""We did not and do not plan to have any affiliation with any governmental organizations of any country."" Social media posts claim the NewProfilePic app accesses people’s banking information and contact lists and sends them to Russia.  The app does not ask for that information. It asks for access to the user’s camera, photos and media. A spokesperson for one of the app’s developers said users’ images are stored on servers in the United States, not Russia. The app’s domain was formerly registered in Moscow because the founder once lived there. However, he has since moved, and the app’s domain address has changed.  We rate this claim False.  PolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this fact check.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC91DF40>],/factchecks/2022/may/16/facebook-posts/newprofilepic-app-not-russian-spy-malware-heres-ho/

Liberal group targets incumbent NC Democrat with false claims
","A political mailer circulating in North Carolina says a Democratic legislator voted against issues important to his own party and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. The ad by N.C. Futures Action Fund, a liberal political action committee, accuses state Sen. Kirk deViere of siding with Republicans on key issues. It says he: ""Voted no on Medicaid expansion for children and seniors. ""Voted no on better pay for our teachers. ""Voted no on Gov. Roy Cooper’s Democratic budget plan."" Cooper’s allies have said deViere has been too friendly with Republicans who control the state legislature, thereby giving away leverage Democrats may have held in budget negotiations.  Cooper took the unusual step of endorsing deViere’s opponent, former Fayetteville City Council member Val Applewhite, in District 19’s Democratic primary. Now the N.C. Futures Action Fund, a dark money group funded by liberal donor Dean Debnam, is paying for attack ads against deViere. While deViere’s critics have said he engages with Republicans in ""backroom"" dealing — a claim deViere disputes — the mailer goes a step further by making false claims about the senator’s votes. Asked about the ""voted no"" claims in the ad, N.C. Futures Action Fund spokesman Michael Weisel said the citations reflect deViere’s actions and aren’t meant to be taken literally. Weisel in an email said that deViere, behind closed doors, was presented with multiple opportunities during budget negotiations to stand with Cooper and his caucus, but ""caved."" Weisel suggested that by voting for the Republican budget, deViere therefore rejected Cooper’s spending plan. When asked to substantiate the claim related to the negotiations, he didn’t immediately provide a response. He previously provided links to WRAL articles about state senate votes on budget bills, but no proof that deViere voted against the issues mentioned in the mailer. ""The statement ‘voting no’ does not require a legislative bill vote, nor does the statement of a bill vote appear in any educational advocacy presented for these points,"" Weisel said in the email. ""Backroom whispers, winks and nods determine whether legislative agendas and policies win or lose, not somebody’s name on a legislative bill vote tally,"" Weisel added. DeViere says that attack is built on lies.   ""Legislators are accountable for our votes because a vote shows constituents where we stand ‘on record,’"" deViere said in an email. ""The claims and statements in this ad and in other ads created by this organization that have run in support of my opponent are flat out false and incorrect. My voting record shows that I delivered results for teachers and public education as a whole, as well as furthered the expansion of Medicaid."" Let’s break down the claims in the ad.  Medicaid expansion. The mailer says deViere ""voted no"" on Medicaid expansion and cites ""voting statistics 2021-22."" This is inaccurate. A clean bill expanding Medicaid as proposed by Cooper didn’t make it to the floor during the most recent legislative session. Cooper and Democrats for years have been pushing to expand Medicaid to provide health insurance coverage to more North Carolinians. The problem for Democrats is that the GOP holds a majority in both chambers of the General Assembly, and many Republican members oppose expansion. House Speaker Tim Moore effectively ruled out Medicaid expansion again last year, saying it couldn’t be included in budget negotiations because it didn’t have enough support in the House. The final state budget — a deal struck between Republican leaders and Cooper — did extend by one year postpartum health care coverage for mothers on Medicaid using funding provided by the Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan. DeViere was one of several state Senate Democrats who voted for the final version of the budget. Teacher pay. The mailer says deViere opposed ""better pay for our teachers,"" and cites a June 25, 2021, vote on an early version of the budget, as well as  ""Governor’s Budget Recommendations, 2021-23."" Voters might get the impression from the ad that deViere opposed raises for teachers or that he voted against the governor’s budget plan. Neither is true. Senate Bill 105 is the budget bill introduced by Republican leaders last year that was amended several times before party leaders reached the budget agreement. The final version of the bill, which became law, gave teachers an average 5% raise over two years, plus a bonus of at least $2,300 in federal pandemic relief money. It also granted an extra $500 to teachers who earn less than $75,000 a year, WRAL reported.  The bill as written on June 25 also included teacher raises, albeit smaller ones. WRAL reported that the June proposal included teacher raises of about 3% over two years.  The early version received less bipartisan support than the final budget compromise. DeViere was one of four Senate Democrats who supported it. Congressional candidates Ben Clark and Don Davis also voted in favor of it, but neither was called out by Cooper for their votes.  The governor’s budget. The ad says deViere ""voted no on Gov. Roy Cooper’s Democratic budget plan,"" citing the budget bill and the governor’s initial budget proposal. That’s also inaccurate. Cooper’s budget proposal was filed as a bill in the state Senate. However, as is the case with most governors’ budget plans, it was never given a vote on the floor or even heard in a committee. In other words, deViere was never asked to choose between the governor’s budget and the GOP budget. The Democrats’ minority status gives the party limited leverage in budget negotiations.  The N.C. Futures Action Action Fund ad says deViere ""voted no"" on Medicaid expansion, teacher raises, and the governor’s budget. But the state senate was never asked to vote on Medicaid expansion or the governor’s budget during the 2021-22 session, as suggested by the mailer. The mailer cites deViere’s vote on SB 105 as opposing ""better pay"" for teachers. That bill included raises for teachers, something Cooper praised when he signed it.

White House errs on vaccine availability, then corrects it
","The White House recently tweeted that when President Joe Biden took office, ""there was no vaccine available."" After widespread pushback on social media, it retracted the claim. On May 12, the White House’s official Twitter account sent a tweet that said in part that ""when President Biden took office … there was no vaccine available"" for COVID-19. When President Biden took office, millions were unemployed and there was no vaccine available. In the last 15 months, the economy has created 8.3M jobs and the unemployment rate stands at 3.6% — the fastest decline in unemployment to start a President's term ever recorded. The tweet attracted wide notice, with critics noting, among other things, that Biden himself had received his first vaccination on Dec. 21, 2020, which was about a month before he was sworn in. Today, I received the COVID-19 vaccine.To the scientists and researchers who worked tirelessly to make this possible — thank you. We owe you an awful lot.And to the American people — know there is nothing to worry about. When the vaccine is available, I urge you to take it. pic.twitter.com/QBtB620i2V On May 13, the White House walked back its original statement, tweeting, ""We previously misstated that vaccines were unavailable in January 2021. We should have said that they were not widely available. Vaccines became available shortly before the president came into office. Since then, he’s responsible for fully vaccinating over 200 million people."" We previously misstated that vaccines were unavailable in January 2021. We should have said that they were not widely available. Vaccines became available shortly before the President came into office. Since then, he’s responsible for fully vaccinating over 200 million people. https://t.co/rHJ0GZ63Dy The White House erred in its first attempt at framing its record on vaccines. While coronavirus vaccines were often hard for ordinary Americans to get, they did exist and were being administered. The first vaccination was administered to an employee at Long Island Jewish Medical Center on Dec. 14, 2020, or six days before Biden received his first shot. Initially, health care workers were among the few categories of Americans who were allowed to receive a vaccination. On Dec. 22, 2020, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made its recommendations for allocating COVID-19 vaccines at a time when production was first ramping up. The idea was to target the available vaccines to those who were most at risk. ""Phase 1a"" was reserved for health care personnel and residents of long-term care facilities, or about 24 million people. In ""phase 1b,"" vaccines would be reserved for people 75 years and older and ""frontline essential workers"" outside of the health care context, a number estimated to total 49 million. In ""phase 1c,"" the vaccine would be given to people between 65 and 74 years, or younger people with certain ""high-risk medical conditions,"" totaling about 129 million people. The actual prioritization decisions were made individually by states, and many states experienced challenges in distributing and allocating the vaccines they had received, both before Biden took office and after. On Jan. 8, or 12 days before Biden took office, the Associated Press reported that of 21.4 million doses distributed, only about 5.9 million had been administered. By that point, the vast majority of doses would have been administered to health care workers, residents of long-term facilities, or other very old Americans.   The data shows that vaccinations accelerated during the first few months of Biden’s presidency. All told, in the 37 days before Biden took office, 21.3 million doses were administered. In Biden’s first 37 days in office, 60.5 million doses were administered, or almost triple the number in the equivalent period before he was sworn in. The White House said, ""When President Biden took office … there was no vaccine available."" A vaccine did exist before Biden took office. In fact, Biden himself received his first shot about a month before he took office. In all, more than 20 million shots were administered while Trump was president. That said, the notion that the vaccine was not ""widely available,"" as the White House’s corrected tweet put it, has better support. Initially, only health-care and other frontline workers, along with the most elderly Americans, were eligible. It took until several months into Biden’s presidency before non-elderly, non-immunocompromised Americans were able to get shots.  We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB0EC640>],/factchecks/2022/may/16/joe-biden/white-house-errs-vaccine-availability-then-correct/

Florida rents are high, but Crist exaggerates with New York market comparison
","U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, a Democratic candidate for governor, laid bare what he thought was at stake on the ballot for Florida voters this November: affordable housing.  Floridians ""are ready for a governor that is focused on the real issues facing our state,"" Crist said at a May 4 press conference. ""This is the real crisis: It costs more to live in many Florida cities than New York City.""   Florida residents are struggling against the backdrop of rising rental prices, explosive demand and limited supply. But are rents as steep as Crist made it seem?  It’s a bit more complicated than his comparison suggests. The cost of living in Florida has risen significantly since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Rent prices have particularly skyrocketed from West Palm Beach to Miami, according to data maintained by Realtor.com.  Realtor.com published a report in March indicating that the median rent in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach area increased about 57% in the last year.  The report examined 50 ""core-based statistical areas,"" meaning geographic regions drafted by the White House Office of Management and Budget that often consist of two or more socioeconomically-tied counties. South Florida, with a median rent of $2,988 a month, outpaced New York City’s median rent of $2,750 in March, per the report. The tri-county region also experienced growth at a faster year-over-year pace than New York City.  Other large metro areas in Florida, however, lagged behind New York City in median rent. For example, the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater area had a median rent of $2,114 a month, an annual increase of around 30%. The median rent price in Jacksonville was $1,580, and the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford area was $1,886. So, New York’s median rent is actually higher than most Florida cities. When looking at for-sale home prices, New York City’s median asking price is also more expensive.  ""From the standpoint of actual rents and property prices, the New York metro remains one of the most expensive metros in the country,"" said Ken Johnson, a real estate economist and dean of Florida Atlantic University’s College of Business.  Crist's characterization is more accurate from the standpoint of rental and ownership premiums, or the percentage difference between the statistically estimated prices of a metro area and its current prices.  Real estate economists measure rental and ownership premiums to assist consumers in gauging whether their current market is over or underpriced.  Researchers from Florida Atlantic University, Florida Gulf Coast University and the University of Alabama analyzed large rental markets across the U.S. and developed a ranking of the most overpriced areas.  Of the 25 most overvalued rental markets in the nation, the highest five are all in Florida.  ""Six months ago, only a couple of Florida metros could be found in the Top 25 of this ranking,"" Johnson told PolitiFact. ""Thus, Florida markets appear to be rising through this ranking very quickly."" The research showed the residents living in Miami-Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Tampa, North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton and Port St. Lucie are paying rent that is overpriced.  In Miami-Fort Lauderdale, for example, renters are paying around 21% more than what they should be, based on the area’s long-term trends. That is the most overvalued market in Florida. Meanwhile, New York City wasn’t featured on the list. According to another study measuring more than 100 U.S. rental markets, New York City ranked 98th.  ""In terms of a premium, the New York metro is one of the least expensive metros in the country,"" Johnson said.  Crist said, ""It costs more to live in many Florida cities than New York City.""   PolitiFact found that the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach area’s median rent exceeded New York City's. However, while Florida cities have experienced record growth, their median rental prices still lag behind New York City. Crist has more of a point when it comes to rental and ownership premiums. According to a study analyzing more than 1oo U.S. rental markets, New York City had one of the least overpriced rents in the country.  We rate Crist’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB10A480>],/factchecks/2022/may/16/charlie-crist/florida-rents-are-high-crist-exaggerates-new-york-/

Pennsylvania US Senate candidate Kathy Barnette wanted Obama statue, but never voted for him
","Pennsylvania Republican Kathy Barnette’s surge in the race for the U.S. Senate GOP nomination means she’s become a target of criticism from some corners of the Republican Party. USA Freedom Fund, a super PAC with links to Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, released an ad that cast Barnette as a fan of former President Barack Obama. Here’s what the ad said: ""Remember when Barack Obama called us bitter, saying in Pennsylvania, we cling to guns or religion or dislike people who aren't like us? Remember how that made you feel? One candidate for Senate doesn't care. In fact, Kathy Barnette wants to build a statue of Barack Obama right next to the one of Abraham Lincoln on Capitol Hill in Washington. Kathy Barnette — woke Republican. Out of touch with Pennsylvania."" Barnette did propose adding a statue of Obama. But that statement alone misses the context that she never supported Obama or his policies. The attack ad seems to suggest otherwise. The spot in Washington, D.C.’s Capitol Hill neighborhood that the ad refers to is Lincoln Park, about a mile east of the Capitol Building. In the middle of the broad, grassy area sits the Emancipation Memorial, a statue that shows Lincoln standing as a formerly enslaved person rises up from a kneeling position. The statue was paid for through a fundraising effort organized by an emancipated woman. Thomas Ball's sculpture depicts President Abraham Lincoln freeing an enslaved man. (NPS) The writer and civil rights leader Frederick Douglass gave the keynote speech at the memorial’s dedication in April 1876. In 2020, during the removal of statues of historic figures who had owned slaves or were tied to the slave trade, Barnette launched an online petition to add two statues on either side of the Emancipation Memorial. One would be of the Obama family, and the other of Douglass. ""We suggest the new statue be positioned so that the freed slave of the Emancipation Memorial Statue appears to be looking towards the First Family,"" Barnette wrote in the petition. ""This will serve as an example of how far we have come as a nation and how we stand today on the shoulders of those who have come before us. "" Asked on a Philadelphia radio show about her plan, Barnette acknowledged that she did so, and explained her intent. ""You have a former slave, Frederick Douglass, looking at a slave that’s rising from slavery, because he’s emancipated by Lincoln,"" Barnette said May 12 on ""The Chris Stigall Show."" ""And you have that slave looking into the future of where this nation will be."" Asked if she supported Obama, Barnette said, ""No."" ""I did not vote for Obama either term,"" she said. ""I looked at who he was, and it did not align with where I am, and what I want for this country."" In 2016, after seven Iranians were freed in a prisoner swap, Barnette tweeted, ""Don't we get it? Obama is a Muslim!"" A super PAC claimed ""Kathy Barnette wants to build a statue of Barack Obama right next to the one of Abraham Lincoln on Capitol Hill."" Barnette said she did propose a statue of Obama and his family, but she never voted for him, or backed his policies.

Providing baby formula for babies held at the border is a legal requirement
","As frightened parents grapple with the country’s ongoing shortage of baby formula, some politicians are criticizing the Biden administration, claiming it’s prioritizing immigrant children detained at the border over American families. The narrative took off after U.S. Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., shared a side-by-side photo comparison of a scene from the southwest border and a U.S. grocery store. ""The first photo is from this morning at the Ursula Processing Center at the U.S. border. Shelves and pallets packed with baby formula,"" Cammack tweeted on May 11. ""The second is from a shelf right here at home. Formula is scarce. This is what America last looks like.""  The first photo is from this morning at the Ursula Processing Center at the U.S. border. Shelves and pallets packed with baby formula.The second is from a shelf right here at home. Formula is scarce. This is what America last looks like. pic.twitter.com/OO0V99njoy A border patrol agent in Texas sent her the photo, Cammack said. She said the agent told her that his facility had been receiving pallets of formula for immigrants who crossed into the U.S. illegally.  Before long, other Republicans and news outlets like Fox News picked up the story. In a joint statement on May 12, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, and National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd took aim at President Joe Biden’s policies.  ""While mothers and fathers stare at empty grocery store shelves in a panic, the Biden administration is happy to provide baby formula to illegal immigrants coming across our southern border,"" read the statement. ""This is yet another one in a long line of reckless, out-of-touch priorities from the Biden administration when it comes to securing our border and protecting Americans.""  PolitiFact was unable to independently verify the authenticity of Cammack’s photo, and a spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not weigh in on that. It is also unclear when this formula was sent, how long it’s been there or how many people need it. We don’t see a reason to doubt that the photo is real; what’s missing from this controversy is context.  Allen Orr, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said that detention facilities regularly stockpile supplies.  ""The formula is there because it’s always there,"" Orr said. Some states are struggling less with the formula shortage than others, he said. ""Are they taking it, too? Or does it just happen to be there?"" What’s more, the Biden administration would be breaking the law if it did not have a supply of formula and other food for people detained in government facilities.  Central to this issue is the 1997 Flores settlement, an agreement that sets standards regarding when U.S. immigration officials can detain unaccompanied minors, how those minors must be treated, and how and when minors should be released from federal custody.  The settlement required officials to release children from detention without delay to a parent or legal guardian, an adult relative or a licensed juvenile program willing to accept custody. A minor can be detained temporarily if it is deemed necessary for the child’s safety or to ensure the child’s timely appearance before an immigration court, according to the agreement. Since 1997, additional rulings by federal judges have interpreted the Flores settlement to mean ""that all minors in detention — accompanied by their parents or not — cannot be held for more than 20 days,"" according to the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors reduced immigration. When officials determine it is necessary to detain a child, however, the Flores settlement requires that minors be held ""in facilities that are safe and sanitary.""  The facility must provide food and drinking water, among other requirements. For infants, that means officials must provide baby formula. A 2015 U.S. Customs and Border Protection document about detention standards acknowledged this: ""Food must be appropriate for at-risk detainees’ age and capabilities (such as formula and baby food)."" A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson provided a statement to PolitiFact that said the agency complies with regulations to make sure all migrants have their basic needs met. The spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about when or where the baby formula in Cammack’s photograph was purchased and stored. Orr said the government is both morally and legally obligated to feed detained children, even during a formula shortage. He referenced both the Flores settlement and international human rights commitments. ""Anyone in a detention facility is afforded food,"" he said.   It’s worth mentioning that former President Donald Trump also followed the rules of the Flores agreement. Trump fought to enact a rule that would have allowed indefinite detention of migrant children, effectively putting an end to the Flores agreement, but his effort was unsuccessful and the administration followed the Flores requirements, the Washington Post reported.  In one 2020 report about how the Trump administration struggled to manage the 2019 influx of migrants at the border, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ""observed all Border Patrol stations had food, snacks, juice, and infant formula available for children.""  We reached out to Cammack and Abbott for comment and did not hear back by deadline. In a statement, Abbott said the Biden administration choosing to send baby formula to the border ""is yet another one in a long line of reckless, out-of-touch priorities"" on the border. An unverified photo suggests that the Biden administration has shelves stocked with baby formula to feed infants at processing centers near the border amid a nationwide formula shortage.  What’s missing from claims like Abbott’s is that the Biden administration’s actions are in keeping with what previous presidents have done to comply with a federal settlement governing the detention of immigrant children. The baby formula shortage continues to cause stress for many American families, but it does not release the government from its legal responsibility to provide adequate care and nutrition to the children in its custody. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCA3C80>],/factchecks/2022/may/13/greg-abbott/providing-baby-formula-babies-held-border-legal-re/

Kathy Barnette largely correct on course of inflation under Joe Biden
","Late in Pennsylvania’s hotly contested Republican Senate primary, Kathy Barnette emerged from seemingly nowhere to challenge the two far better-known and better-funded candidates: celebrity surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz and former hedge fund executive Dave McCormick. Barnette, a conservative activist and military veteran, posted portions of an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham to her Facebook page in which the candidate criticized President Joe Biden’s handling of the economy, especially the rise in inflation. Biden, she said, ""inherited inflation of 1.7%. Now we're well over 8% and growing."" This is basically accurate, though what she indicated about inflation still ""growing"" is speculative. The benchmark inflation measurement, known as the consumer price index, is often calculated by how much the basket of measured goods cost compared to the same month one year earlier. In Biden’s first full month in office, February 2021, prices were 1.7% higher than they were in February 2020. That’s the figure Barnette cited. Prices have risen consistently ever since. The peak so far came in March 2022, when prices stood 8.5% higher than they were in March 2021. This also tracks with Barnette’s statement.   That said, after hitting 8.5% in March, the year-over-year figure for April was 8.3%, which was a decrease, albeit a slight one. Barnette may eventually be proven right to say that inflation will keep growing, but to say so now runs counter to the most recent month and amounts to speculation. While no one knows how inflation will look over the next few months, it’s possible that the rate of increase could slow somewhat, just based on how the figure is calculated. In May 2020, inflation was 5%, which was significantly higher than the previous year-ago baseline that has been used for the calculation in recent months. So is Biden to blame? Economists say his policies have played a role, but that they are one factor among many.  Economists estimate that the money circulated by Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan has driven half or less of the inflation bump. The rest of the factors include COVID-19’s impact on labor markets and supply chains and, most recently, Russia’s war in Ukraine, which has driven a price shock for gasoline. Barnette said Biden ""inherited inflation of 1.7%. Now we're well over 8% and growing."" She is right on the numbers: Inflation has spiked significantly on Biden’s watch, partially though not entirely due to his policies, according to analysts. However, the year-over-year increase in inflation dropped slightly between March 2022 and April 2022, so to say it’s still ""growing"" is premature.

No, making your own homemade baby formula is not safe or recommended
","As people grapple with America’s infant formula shortage, some social media users have started sharing homemade recipes, telling frantic parents who can’t find food for their babies that they can make their own formula instead. One post claimed, falsely, that the ""shortage is manufactured"" and then went on to say that people could use raw goat’s milk or make her friend’s homemade recipe. Another offered a recipe with cow’s milk, whey and a variety of oils, saying homemade formula can be a ""viable option when you do it correctly."" And another offered up a tattered 1960s recipe card that called for giving the baby two level tablespoons of Karo corn syrup. Feeding babies homemade formula — no matter how legitimate or questionable the recipe may appear — is dangerous and not recommended as an alternative to store-bought formula.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises against making formula and says consuming homemade formula can result in adverse health effects for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics also strongly advises against homemade formulas, saying they are not safe and do not meet babies’ nutritional needs. The shortage of infant formula has been attributed to COVID-19 related supply chain issues, inflation, and a February 2022 product recall by Abbott, a major U.S. manufacturer of baby food, that temporarily halted production at its Sturgis, Michigan plant. The White House recently announced steps intended to ease the shortage, including making it easier to import formula and cracking down on price gouging. The FDA is also expediting and streamlining some of its processes in an effort to address the shortage. Following cases in 2021 of hospitalized infants suffering from low calcium after being fed homemade formula, the FDA reported that potential problems with homemade versions include contamination and inadequate amounts of critical nutrients. ""These problems are very serious, and the consequences range from severe nutritional imbalances to foodborne illnesses, both of which can be life-threatening,"" the agency said. Homemade formulas may not provide enough of some nutrients, or they can contain too-large quantities of others, which is equally dangerous.  For example, homemade formula might have too much salt, which infants’ kidneys and livers cannot handle in large amounts, wrote Dr. Steven Abrams, chair of the National Committee on Nutrition for the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a May 9 blog post. ""If your baby doesn't get enough of the important parts of infant formula — even for a few days or weeks — they can suffer long term effects on their abilities to grow strong and do well in school,"" Abrams said. ""Lack of these nutrients can lead to severe health problems and even death. Homemade formulas may also lead to risks of contamination, causing infections or may even cause serious problems with high or low levels of minerals like calcium or electrolytes such as sodium."" Commercial infant formulas, on the other hand, ""are designed to mimic human breast milk as closely as possible, and are carefully regulated to make sure they have the nutrients growing babies need — in a form their bodies can process,"" the New York Times reported. Social media users are sharing homemade infant formula recipes amid the shortage and are claiming that homemade formula is safe.  Pediatricians and organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and FDA all advise against making and feeding homemade baby formula to infants. These recipes can rob babies of essential nutrients needed for development and may also lead to risks of contamination and infection. Such recipes aren’t considered safe and should not replace store-bought formula. We rate posts stating otherwise False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7D46C0>],/factchecks/2022/may/13/facebook-posts/no-making-your-own-homemade-baby-formula-not-safe-/

Fact-checking Lindsey Graham on the US allowing abortions at 20 weeks
","In an interview on Fox News, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the U.S. is unusually permissive on abortion relative to the rest of the world. ""We’re one of the seven nations in the world that allow abortion on demand at 20 weeks,"" Graham said May 8 on ""Fox News Sunday."" Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop told PolitiFact that group included China and North Korea, adding that ""the United States should not be in that club."" The group also includes countries, such as Canada, the Netherlands, South Korea and New Zealand. But before we dig into the details, Graham’s phrase, ""abortion on demand,"" opens the door to adding more countries to the list. Particularly in Europe, broad exceptions allow women to get an abortion at up to 20 to 24 weeks. Graham’s statistic traces back to a 2014 report by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a research group that opposes abortion. The countries flagged in the Lozier report are: the United States, China, North Korea, Canada, the Netherlands, Vietnam and Singapore.  The Lozier study included countries if their laws failed to specify the allowed reasons for an abortion — the woman's well-being, for example — and permitted abortions at 20 weeks or later in the pregnancy.  In a footnote, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito referred to the report in his leaked draft opinion, which would overturn the 1973 landmark case Roe v. Wade.  The footnote also cited data from the Center for Reproductive Rights, a group that supports abortion rights, and added Iceland and Guinea-Bissau to the list because they ""are now also similarly permissive.""  Margaret Harpin, a legal adviser for the Center for Reproductive Rights, told PolitiFact that by their count, 12 countries now allow abortions up to 20 weeks or later without specifying a particular reason for seeking one. Graham’s reference to seven nations tracks with the 2014 Lozier study, but since then, laws have changed and that number has increased to 12.  Beyond that, PolitiFact’s analysis found that there are more nations that allow abortions at or beyond the 20-week mark. They do so on the basis of socioeconomic welfare or mental health. Graham cast the U.S. as an outlier, but Fordham University law professor Julie Suk said international comparisons are challenging.  ""Many Americans use the term ‘abortion on demand’ in a way that would encompass ‘medically indicated abortion’ in Europe,"" Suk said. ""So the comparison of abortion here and abortion in Europe gets very sloppy and confused."" (The challenge of international comparisons has led to different PolitiFact ratings over the years, with most finding that claims like Graham’s leave out important context.) Under current U.S. Supreme Court rulings, a woman has the right to an abortion up to the point of viability of the fetus. No exact minimum number of weeks defines when a fetus can survive outside the womb. The most premature infant that has survived in the U.S. was born at about 21 weeks. Once a fetus is viable, states can ban abortion, so long as the mother's life or health isn’t at risk.  In over 20 countries, family circumstances or mental health are grounds for an abortion at 20 weeks or later. In Australia, laws vary by state or territory, but the three largest states permit abortions at 22 to 24 weeks. Japan allows abortions up to 22 weeks for socioeconomic reasons. In South Africa, abortions based on socioeconomic factors are allowed up to 20 weeks. Rwanda allows abortions on broad socioeconomic grounds until 22 weeks. Our scan of laws across Europe found 18 countries extend the allowable number of weeks to get an abortion based on the mental health of the mother or socioeconomic concerns. In the Czech Republic, an abortion can take place up to week 20 for mental health reasons. In Ukraine, the law gives flexibility up to the 22nd week. Great Britain allows abortion until 24 weeks of pregnancy if continuation of the pregnancy involves risk ""of injury to physical or mental health"" of the patient or any of her existing children.  Northeastern University law professor Martha Davis has spoken with legal experts across Europe about the ease of accessing abortions at 20 weeks or later. ""Folks from places like Denmark, Sweden, England, and others with similar laws said that it was a non-issue to meet the paper requirements to obtain a later term abortion,"" Davis said. Law professor Federico Fabbrini at Dublin City University said that a woman’s request carries weight and in the U.K., ""medical approval of an abortion request is a matter of course,"" at up to 24 weeks in pregnancy.  The U.S. and other countries view abortion law through different lenses. In Europe and elsewhere, a woman’s right to choose is less at the center of these laws than Americans might think. ""None of the countries that the U.S. considers to be its peers recognize a constitutional right to terminate pregnancy, as a matter of private choice, for any reason, up until the moment of fetal viability,"" wrote Suk of Fordham in a forthcoming William and Mary Law Review article. It’s less about individual rights, Suk said, and more about defining the terms of what will lead to the best outcome for both the country and the person who is pregnant and their family. A de facto three-phase approach has emerged. In the first phase, the state imposes few limits on abortions up to about 11 to 14 weeks. ""Between early pregnancy and approaching the viability line — anywhere from 20 to 28 weeks — the law imposes procedural hurdles for permitted abortions,"" Suk wrote. After that, the law might or might not explicitly ban abortions, but in either case, they are rare and only occur in immediate life-threatening circumstances.  Graham said that the U.S. is one of ""seven nations in the world that allow abortion on demand at 20 weeks."" This is based on a 2014 study from a center that opposes abortion rights; the study highlighted countries that allow abortions at 20 weeks or later in a pregnancy and whose laws did not spell out under what circumstances abortions are permitted. Since that study, five additional countries now meet those criteria. And beyond that, there are more than 20 countries with flexible frameworks that allow abortions at 20 weeks or later. Graham’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and context. We rate his claim Half True. RELATED: Fact-checking 5 claims in the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion on Roe v.

"['Agriculture', 'Kathy Barnette']","
Kathy Barnette is wrong that agriculture is Pennsylvania’s No. 1 industry
","In the final days of Pennsylvania’s GOP hotly contested Senate primary, a little-known candidate, Kathy Barnette, has risen in the polls, equaling two far better known and far better funded candidates: celebrity surgeon Mehmet Oz and former hedge fund executive Dave McCormick. In an interview with conservative commentator Glenn Beck just days before the May 17 primary, Barnette said she was concerned about farmers in the state who are grappling with rising costs, as well as the consumers who will have to pay those costs in grocery stores. During the interview, which was posted to Barnette’s Facebook page on May 12, Barnette sought to put the plight of farmers in the statewide context. ""Agriculture is the No. 1 industry here in Pennsylvania,"" she said. But that’s not even close to accurate. Barnette’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article. We turned to official federal data on Pennsylvania’s gross domestic product for 2021. The data details the gross domestic product for some 14 major industry sectors. It said the biggest industry sector in Pennsylvania in 2021 was finance, insurance, and real estate at almost 21%. That was followed by professional and business services (almost 15%); manufacturing (almost 14%); and education, health, and social services (about 13%). Way down the list — below utilities, energy drilling and mining, and even miscellaneous — is agriculture, at less than half of 1% of Pennsylvania’s total economic output.   Agriculture did account for $3.6 billion in Pennsylvania in 2021, so it’s not peanuts. But in the context of a nearly $839 billion economy, agriculture accounts for only a small sliver of all economic activity in Pennsylvania. Barnette said, ""Agriculture is the No. 1 industry here in Pennsylvania."" Although agriculture in Pennsylvania accounted for $3.6 billion in economic activity in 2021, that’s a tiny fraction of the state’s total economic output. Agriculture ranks last among 14 major categories of private industry in the state, with less than one-half of 1% of the state’s economic activity that year.

Fact-checking Joe Biden on paying down the federal debt
","Amid public concerns about high inflation rates, President Joe Biden sought to reassure Americans that his administration had a handle on the economy. One of the positive signs, Biden said, was that under his administration, the federal government was poised to pay down a portion of the $23.8 trillion federal debt for the first time in several years. ""My Treasury Department is planning to pay down the national debt this quarter, which never happened under my predecessor,"" Biden said at the White House on May 10. ""Not once. Not once."" The Treasury Department has said it’s planning to make a modest debt-reduction outlay in the second quarter of 2022, but when looked at in context, this paydown isn’t the notable fiscal turnaround that Biden implies. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. In a memo released May 2, Treasury announced that it intends to pay down $26 billion in debt during 2022's second quarter. This is typically accomplished by paying off outstanding Treasury securities so the government doesn’t have to keep paying interest. The last time the government paid down the debt was in the second quarter of 2016, under President Barack Obama.  This means that under President Donald Trump, the Treasury did not pay down the debt in any quarter.  But there are some important bits of context that Biden left out. One is that the same Treasury memo that announced the upcoming debt pay-down noted that during the first quarter of 2022, the government needed to borrow $668 billion, and during the third quarter of 2022, it expects to borrow $182 billion. In other words, the modest paydown in the second quarter would be overwhelmed by the new borrowing during the first and third quarters — complicating the point Biden was trying to make about fiscal responsibility. Biden is also wrong that the Trump administration was never ""planning"" to pay down debt.  On Feb. 3, 2020, the Trump administration announced that in the second quarter of 2020, it was planning to pay down $56 billion of debt. Of course, that was a few weeks before the coronavirus pandemic reached the U.S. The debt payment never happened. At the moment, both Biden and Trump are in the same position: They’ve announced a paydown but haven’t yet completed it; events could still intervene. So, at least for now, the two presidents are roughly in the same boat. It’s also worth noting that the planned and actual paydowns cited here have all occurred during the second quarter of the year. That’s not a coincidence. Typically, the federal government is flush with cash in the second quarter, thanks to tax payments made around the tax-deadline time of April 15. So, if any quarter is going to provide the government with some extra cash to pay down the debt, it’s the second quarter.  ""Not every second quarter are we able to pay down the debt, but the most likely quarter to do it is the second quarter,"" said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Having a second-quarter debt paydown doesn’t mean that the government will be able to do similar paydowns in the succeeding three quarters. In recent history, it hasn’t been able to. Biden said, ""My Treasury Department is planning to pay down the national debt this quarter, which never happened under my predecessor."" The Treasury has announced its intention to pay down $26 billion in debt during the second quarter of 2022.  However, the federal government’s planned paydown during the second quarter — when the government is flush with tax payments — will be swamped by new borrowing during the other three quarters of the year. The Trump administration was also ""planning"" to pay down the debt during the second quarter of 2020 but was stymied by the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic.  We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7DBF00>],/factchecks/2022/may/13/joe-biden/fact-checking-joe-biden-paying-down-federal-debt/
