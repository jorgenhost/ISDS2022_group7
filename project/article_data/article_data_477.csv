Does Oregon lead the nation in number of jobs per capita in manufacturing?
 ","It’s been nearly six years since the start of the Great Recession and, finally, hiring is on the rise. But with more Oregonians living in poverty now than before the bottom dropped out, politicians around the state are debating how best to create new jobs. Talk of jobs was on everyone’s mind at the 10th annual Oregon Leadership Summit Dec. 9 at the Oregon Convention Center. The Oregon Business Plan -- a collaborative effort involving business leaders, business associations and the state’s elected leaders -- commissioned a paper called ""Path to Prosperity,"" which was released at the daylong session’s opening. The paper, written by ECONorthwest, an economic consulting and planning firm, focused on four strategies aimed at reducing poverty. One, touching on the need to bolster manufacturing, included this statement: ""Oregon leads the nation in number of jobs per capita in manufacturing."" It’s an impressive claim but seemed at odds with a 2012 finding by PolitiFact Wisconsin, which awarded that same honor to the Badger State. In hopes of heading off any inter-state squabbling, PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We called Josh Lehner, a senior economist with the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis. ""I saw that, too,"" he said. ""Let me check some numbers and I’ll call you back."" Lehner’s own calculation took Oregon’s annual Census Bureau population estimates and divided them by the number of manufacturing jobs in Oregon, as represented by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Things did not compute. ""Our manufacturing jobs per capita actually rank 22nd nationally,’’ Lehner said. He said he respects work done by ECONorthwest, but added, ""As for us being number one in that category, the math just doesn’t add up."" (Asked about Wisconsin, he said his figures show that state does, in fact, lead the country in manufacturing jobs per capita.) We called John Tapogna, president of ECONorthwest and co-author of the paper, to ask about the apparent discrepancy. He immediately cleared up any confusion. ""You caught a flaw in our report,"" he said. ""In the same way newspapers have to run corrections sometimes, we need to run one with this."" Two words, Tapogna added, turned the claim from true to false. ""We said Oregon leads the nation in the number of jobs per capita in manufacturing,"" he said. ""What we should have said is that Oregon leads the nation in manufacturing output per capita. It was just a mistake. There’s no other way to say it."" Lehner verified that Oregon does indeed lead in manufacturing output per capita. Tapogna went on to provide information with which many Oregonians may be unaware. It all started, he said, with Gordon Moore, Intel’s co-founder, who predicted in 1965 that semiconductor industry innovations would enable twice as many transistors to be crammed onto an integrated circuit every two years or so. Known as ""Moore’s Law,"" the prediction has proved true. In the real world, it’s continued to dramatically increase the value of the output, thus allowing Oregon to rank first nationally in manufacturing output per capita. David Autor, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, added a cautionary note in an email. ""Not all manufacturing jobs are great jobs, and certainly not all great jobs are manufacturing jobs. But if Wisconsin or Oregon have manufacturing industries in which they have the skills, expertise and productivity needed to compete on the national and international market, that’s a valuable thing -- something many states would surely like to emulate."" The Oregon Business Plan, in aiming to reduce the state’s poverty rate from the current 17.2 percent to 10 percent by 2020, makes job creation a centerpiece of pursuing that goal. Public- and private-sector leaders, at last week’s Oregon Leadership Summit, said building on existing strengths such as manufacturing will be critical to long-term success. ECONorthwest, in preparing a paper delineating that success, wrote that ""Oregon leads the nation in number of jobs per capita in manufacturing."" The sentence needed to be rewritten to say the state leads the nation in manufacturing output per capita. That would have made the claim true. But regardless of the correction that followed, PolitiFact Oregon makes its rulings based on original claims. Not to detract from the success Oregon is having in semiconductor manufacturing, but we rate the original claim False.",/factchecks/2013/dec/13/econorthwest-economics-finance-planning/does-oregon-lead-nation-number-jobs-capita-manufac/

Howard Fineman: Steve Stockman wants 'gun-filled' schools
","Texas politics took an unexpected turn when Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman filed just before the deadline to run against incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn. Assessing the matchup of two conservative candidates, Huffington Post columnist Howard Fineman said Stockman’s world is all about guns. ""This is a guy who not only doesn't want gun-free zones around schools. He basically wants gun-filled zones in schools,"" Fineman said on MSNBC’s All In with Chris Hayes. We decided to check Fineman’s assertion. At the start of this year, a few weeks after the Newtown, Conn., shootings, Stockman introduced the Safe Schools Act of 2013. The bill was very simple. It would repeal a federal law that bans everyone except law enforcement from bringing a weapon inside a school. The bill’s stated purpose was ""to restore safety to America's schools by allowing staff, teachers, and administrators to defend the children and themselves."" There is no question that Stockman envisioned more people with firearms at schools. ""Stockman clearly likes that scenario,"" said David Kopel, an associate policy analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute and a proponent of Second Amendment rights. Where Kopel differs with Fineman’s rhetorical flourish is on the point of whether the schools would be full of guns. ""When I think of a gun-filled zone, I think of a gun show or going to the annual meeting of the NRA (National Rifle Association) where you know that you are never more than 50 feet from someone with a conceal carry permit and a gun,"" Kopel said. So, Kopel says Fineman engaged in a bit of exaggeration. The other supporters of gun rights we reached said the whole point of Stockman’s bill was to give principals, teachers and staff the ability to defend themselves and their students. We asked Stockman’s office for evidence that more guns would yield more security and did not hear back. But Kopel and Erich Pratt, director of communications for Gun Owners of America, both pointed to the example in Pearl, Miss., where a student opened fire in 1997. An assistant principal ran out to his car where he kept a gun and successfully apprehended the shooter. Pratt also said a Centers for Disease Control study found that the number of times a gun was used defensively was much greater than the number of times a gun was used to kill someone. The actual words from the report, which was a survey of past research, were a bit more nuanced. The authors noted that there was much debate about the data and said ""defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals."" The report added that gun-using crime victims have lower injury rates than victims who use other defensive strategies, however it noted that we don’t know if that protective benefit outweighs the deaths and injuries associated with gun ownership in general. The gun debate is fueled by conflicting values and studies. David Hemenway, professor of health policy at Harvard School of Public Health, said he knows of no report that shows that armed civilians provide a protective factor. In his view, the evidence speaks to quite the opposite conclusion. ""Studies do show that where there are more households with guns, all other things equal, there is more homicide because there is more gun homicide,"" Hemenway said. Our experts could not point to research on whether armed school personnel would afford the students greater safety, largely because most states don’t allow guns inside schools and episodes of gunmen opening fire in schools are rare. ""It’s hard for social science to do studies of such low frequency events,"" Kopel said. Our ruling Fineman said that Stockman ""basically wants gun-filled schools."" Stockman did introduce a bill that would make it easier for states to allow school personnel to carry firearms. The bill’s stated purpose was to allow those people to defend themselves and their students from an armed intruder. Our experts agreed that Stockman’s goal was to see more firearms inside schools. We did not hear from Stockman’s office so there is no way to know if he envisioned an upper limit to that increase. Based on his bill itself, there would be none. We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2013/dec/13/howard-fineman/howard-fineman-steve-stockman-wants-gun-filled-sch/
"['Polls and Public Opinion', 'Texas', 'Steve Stockman']","
Polls showed Rick Perry or Ron Paul ahead of John Cornyn, but senator ran ahead of other tested challengers including Steve Stockman
","The congressman challenging two-term U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in the 2014 Republican primary says Cornyn is vulnerable from the right. In a Dec. 10, 2013, blog post on his campaign website, Steve Stockman of Friendswood specified: ""In every poll liberal John Cornyn always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about."" Calling Cornyn liberal is questionable, though we see that as Stockman’s opinion and not something that we could put to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. Suffice to say that Cornyn came out as the Senate’s second-least liberal and second-most conservative member in a February 2013 vote analysis by National Journal magazine. We turned instead to whether every poll shows Cornyn losing re-election to ""any conservative the voters have heard about."" Voter polls Unfortunately, we failed to hear back from Stockman as we weighed the results of three fall 2013 voter polls testing Cornyn for re-election against particular possible Republican foes. An October 2013 poll by the University of Texas and Texas Tribune showed Cornyn leading at 39 percent against two little-known opponents, Dwayne Stovall and Erick Wyatt. Forty-eight percent of respondents had no opinion. On Nov. 14, 2013, UT government lecturer Jim Henson, one of the pollsters, wrote for the Tribune that this was ""by no means a forceful showing for an incumbent senator in a state as red as Texas, and has further fueled whispers of a primary challenge."" Elaborating by email, Henson told us Cornyn saw his voter favorability ratings among Texas conservatives drop through the summer, ""which helped fuel further talk of a challenge from the right."" Neither Stovall or Wyatt was widely known when the poll was taken, Henson said. Per Stockmn’s focus on Republicans Texans had ""heard about,"" Henson offered: ""I think it would roughly be fair to say that anyone who has previously run statewide or nationally, or has in some other way been the subject of media exposure, could be referred to as someone people have ‘heard about.’"" Two polls to go. In early November 2013, a survey taken by North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling indicated Cornyn was not the favorite of 388 past Republican primary voters, who by 49 percent to 33 percent indicated they would prefer a more conservative nominee. That poll also showed Cornyn ahead in hypothetical one-on-one faceoffs with two party figures and trailing another hypothetical challenger. According to a Nov. 6, 2013, press release on the results, Cornyn ran ahead of Biblical historian David Barton, former vice chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, by 51 percent to 18 percent, and led U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, by 40 percent to 31 percent. The poll also asked about a hypothetical matchup between Cornyn and Gov. Rick Perry. The result: Perry drew 46 percent to Cornyn’s 35 percent. (Perry, of course, is not challenging Cornyn and has, in fact, endorsed him.) By email, PPP spokesman Tom Jensen noted that 38 percent of the polled voters had an opinion of Gohmert. Jensen said the firm did not poll on Barton’s name recognition, ""but it doubtless would have been lower."" Jensen wrote: ""My bar of whether voters have heard about a candidate would be whether they have 50% name recognition,"" meaning half or more of the voters recognize the candidate’s name. ""Perry was the only one we tested who fit that bill. So Stockman’s statement might be true at some level but it’s not particularly compelling since there really just wasn’t much polling out there testing Cornyn against anyone who voters are very familiar with."" Next, Jensen pointed us to an Oct. 26, 2013, poll by Human Events and Florida-based Gravis Marketing indicating that a generic ""Tea Party"" candidate, unnamed, would lead Cornyn among Republicans by 46 percent to 33 percent, according to a Gravis Marketing summary. The poll involved 563 Republicans, the firm said, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. According to the summary, Cornyn led several hypothetical one-on-one races--including versus Stockman. The summary says Cornyn led Gohmert in its polls by 45 percent to 20 percent and ran ahead of Stockman, 41 percent to 15 percent. But Cornyn trailed in a one-on-one matchup with U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, who has run for president several times, 44 percent to 34 percent, the summary states. We wondered about a seeming conflict in the Gravis results: Cornyn outpacing Rafael Cruz, whose son, Ted, is the junior senator from Texas, by 39 percent to 33 percent, in their hypothetical one-on-one matchup yet in a later poll result, the elder Cruz leading Cornyn, Paul and Stockman in a hypothetical four-way primary. The latter question was: ""If the Republican primary were held today, would you vote for Cornyn, Cruz, Paul or Stockman?"" The results: Cruz, 41 percent, Cornyn at 25 percent, Paul at 18 percent and Stockman at 3 percent. By telephone, the president of Gravis Marketing, Doug Kaplan, told us he suspects some poll respondents answering the four-way question thought they were considering a Ted Cruz candidacy against Cornyn rather than a race involving his father, with the erroneous effect being a boost to the elder Cruz’s poll standing. ""I’m not confident with the way we worded that question,"" Kaplan said. Cornyn’s objection To our inquiry, Cornyn’s Senate campaign disputed Stockman’s website statement. By email, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie pointed out that no one leading Cornyn  in the three polls was shown as attracting more than half the vote--in other words, winning the nomination outright. On another front, Brandewie maintained that Texas Republicans have ""heard about"" the two candidates bested by Cornyn in the UT/Tribune poll as well as Barton, Gohmert and the elder Cruz, each of whom did not lead Cornyn in the polled one-on-one matchups. Our ruling Stockman said: ""In every poll,"" John Cornyn ""always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about."" In Stockman's favor, recent polling suggests Cornyn trailing Perry and Paul, two well-known Republicans, in hypothetical one-on-one matches. But polls also have shown Cornyn running ahead of Barton, Gohmert and Stockman. These Texans are almost certainly less known than Paul and Perry, both of whom ran for president. Yet Gohmert and Stockman are members of Congress and Barton has long been a grass-roots leader. We think it reasonable to consider each one a conservative that ""voters have heard about,"" which makes Stockman’s statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Will the Affordable Care Act close down volunteer fire departments?
","Editor's note: Almost two months after we published this report, the Obama administration clarified guidelines on volunteer fire departments. The new rules specifically exempt volunteer fire and rescue units. Read our story that details the new guidelines. Our original report from December is below.  Few things tug on the heart strings, or put fear in people’s minds, like the image of a small town losing its volunteer fire station. So you can imagine why a number of readers alerted us to a Facebook post making the rounds that alleged just that. According to a graphic posted by Generation Opportunity, an organization that opposes the Affordable Care Act through outreach to young people, the health care law will have an adverse effect on volunteer emergency services. ""Obamacare could force thousands of volunteer fire stations to cut service,"" the post alleges, ""or close entirely!"" As of Dec. 12, the post had nearly 4,000 shares, 2,500 ""Likes,"" and dozens of comments. We’ve heard plenty of claims about the Affordable Care Act and its effect on employers, but hadn’t looked into how it treats volunteer fire stations. Ask and you shall receive, readers. What’s at issue There actually is quite a bit of uncertainty regarding the health care law and how it addresses local volunteer emergency services. The employer mandate in the law states that employers with the equivalent of 50 or more full-time employees must provide health insurance to their workers. If not, they face a stiff penalty of $2,000 for every worker after 30. There are 783,300 volunteer firefighters in the United States and nearly 25,500 stations are either entirely or mostly made up of volunteers, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Some of them are small, serve rural areas, and are made up of a handful of volunteers. They’re not likely to be affected by the law. Then there’s the question of hours worked. The law specifies that a full-time employee works at least 30 hours a week. Many volunteers wouldn’t hit that threshold, though it is unclear how hours would be counted. Does it include time spent on call or fundraising for the department? The National Volunteer Fire Council is concerned that the employer mandate will still apply to many stations. Under current law, the Internal Revenue Service considers a volunteer an employee for tax purposes. ""It does not matter whether firefighters are termed ‘volunteers,’ are considered employees, or are identified by any other name, if the work they do is subject to the will and control of the payer, under the common-law rules, they are employees for federal tax purposes,"" according to the IRS. That allows any benefits a volunteer firefighter receives to be taxed. And while the U.S. Department of Labor has tight restrictions on the benefits (mostly awarded to cover the costs of travel and equipment for the job) a volunteer can receive, so far the IRS has not said whether it will treat them as employees or volunteers under the Affordable Care Act. In fact, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released draft regulations last year for the employer mandate. There was no mention of volunteer fire services. ""The more we looked at the law we saw there’s nothing in this that says the IRS has to listen to the Department of Labor,"" said Dave Finger, director of government relations for the National Volunteer Fire Council, an organization representing volunteer fire, EMS, and rescue services. ""Around the spring we realized this could be a significant problem for our folks. Finger added that most volunteer fire stations serve sparsely populated areas that don’t have a large tax base. Some even get their revenue from pancake breakfast fundraisers. Finding the resources to suddenly pay for health insurance or the fee would be very difficult. Some stations employ more than 50 volunteers, some volunteers lend their time to stations operated by county or municipal governments with more than 50 employees, and others band together and can surpass the mandate threshold that way. Under any of these scenarios, volunteer departments are worried they could be required to offer health insurance. Lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol, and both sides of the aisle, agree that the law is vague and could potentially affect volunteer units. Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., has introduced a bill in the House that would exempt volunteer forces from the employer mandate, and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., has asked the Senate to do the same. ""(The Treasury) put out regulations that didn’t include this,"" said Elizabeth Falcone, a legislative assistant in Warner’s office. ""It wasn’t clear it was going to be dealt with and revised. There’s a history of showing why strong force is important (to get action from IRS). ""When there’s ambiguity you need to create certainty,"" she added. ""And that’s the issue. That’s what we’re trying to fix."" How big is the problem? But let’s get back to what the graphic said: The Affordable Care Act could ""force thousands of volunteer fire stations to cut service or close entirely!"" We reached out to Generation Opportunity to get clarity on the severity of the accusation. They didn’t reply to our call. But both Warner’s office and the National Volunteer Fire Council felt that was a big leap. ""That sounds like the predictable messaging you would hear about these issues,"" said Kevin Hall, spokesman for Warner. ""In Virginia, we have a highly organized and professional volunteer fire team in Virginia Beach, and they sniff at this as being a nonissue. But there is concern in some communities and they’re seeking help in getting more definitive guidance."" It’s also worth noting that most volunteers have other full-time jobs, Finger said, and would receive health benefits from their employer or the government. Additionally, many stations don’t come close to reaching the 50-employee threshold, no matter how the IRS chooses to count them. It would also require the IRS to go out and enforce the law and target volunteer fire stations. While ""it’s a worst-case scenario that you can’t rule out,"" Finger said he thought department closures were ""unlikely"" and thousands of closures were ""very unlikely."" There’s no doubt that if the employer mandate is applied to volunteer fire departments it would mean additional costs for those that qualify. But it’s more likely departments will decrease their workforce or cut and cap other benefits volunteer forces receive, before slashing services or closing stations, Finger said. For their part, the Treasury Department said it was taking the concerns of volunteer firefighters and other emergency services into account as it works toward the final employer mandate regulations, though they could not say when that would be. President Barack Obama has also delayed the employer mandate for a year, so it won’t go into effect until 2015. And Warner’s office said the cast of support he has recruited for his bill, including two Democrats, two Republicans and an independent, ""was noteworthy to people in White House,"" and they expected action sooner than later. Finger echoed those sentiments. ""We’re telling our members: ‘One, we think it’s going to be fixed,’"" he said. ""‘And two, no penalties are coming until 2015, so it’s still a long way off. Don’t do anything drastic now.’"" Our ruling The Facebook post said ""Obamacare could force thousands of volunteer fire stations to cut service or close entirely!"" ""Could"" is a dangerous word that allows rabble rousers to generate hysteria without being completely false, but we think it’s somewhat inflated. There certainly is cause for concern, but even those looking to change the status quo see this as an exaggeration. Furthermore, it sounds like those in the know expect the issue to be resolved now that pressure is mounting. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it as Half True.",/factchecks/2013/dec/13/generation-opportunity/will-affordable-care-act-close-down-volunteer-fire/
"['Environment', 'Climate Change', 'Corrections and Updates', 'Weather', 'Texas', 'Barry Smitherman']","
UPDATED: Scientific consensus remains that the planet is warming
","Barry Smitherman sees the planet as not warming. Smitherman, a candidate for Texas attorney general, responded to Republican activist Donna Garner in a Nov. 17, 2013, email: ""Donna, I have been battling this global warming hoax for 6 years now. The earth is not warming…"" A day later, Garner included his comment in an email blast to recipients including reporters. That claim by Smitherman, who also chairs the Texas Railroad Commission, contradicts the latest word from the international body that regularly sifts scientific findings related to climate. An October 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report intended for policymakers states: ""Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased."" Candidate's backup We were curious how Smitherman reached his conclusion. His campaign consultant, Allen Blakemore, emailed us web links to about a dozen articles essentially saying that the planet has not been warming as fast as predicted of late or is, in fact, cooling. A Jan. 27, 2012, Wall Street Journal opinion piece, signed by 16 scientists, said there was no need for countries to take drastic steps against greenhouse gases. A secondary theme of the piece was that planetary warming had been smaller than predicted for more than a decade. Similarly, a Sept. 8, 2013, news story in the Telegraph, a British newspaper, said: ""Despite the original forecasts, major climate research centres now accept that there has been a ‘pause’ in global warming since 1997."" The story quoted two U.S. professors, Judith Curry of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Anastasios Tsonis of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, as saying the planet appears headed into a cooling period. A Forbes magazine article by Peter Ferrara, published May 31, 2012, said ""natural climate cycles have already turned from warming to cooling, global temperatures have already been declining for more than 10 years, and global temperatures will continue to decline for another two decades or more,"" a conclusion Ferrara attributed to presentations at a conference on climate change hosted by the libertarian Heartland Institute. By email, Blakemore and Jared Craighead, Smitherman’s campaign manager, urged us to view a video placed on YouTube on June 27, 2012, of a presentation by Don Easterbrook, a professor emeritus of geology at Western Washington University. In it, Easterbrook said that scant temperature changes support his 2000 statement that global warming is over, making the key question only how intense the cooling period will be. Also noted by Blakemore: An Oct. 13, 2012, commentary by David Rose in the Daily Mail, a British publication, which began: ""The world stopped getting warmer almost 16 years ago, according to new data released last week. The figures, which have triggered debate among climate scientists, reveal that from the beginning of 1997 until August 2012, there was no discernible rise in aggregate global temperatures. This means that the ‘plateau’ or ‘pause’ in global warming has now lasted for about the same time as the previous period when temperatures rose, 1980 to 1996. Before that, temperatures had been stable or declining for about 40 years."" Rose quoted Curry, of Georgia, as saying the data confirmed a pause in global warming. ""Climate models are very complex, but they are imperfect and incomplete,"" Curry said. ""Natural variability (the impact of factors such as long-term temperature cycles in the oceans and the output of the sun) has been shown over the past two decades to have a magnitude that dominates the greenhouse warming effect. It is becoming increasingly apparent that our attribution of warming since 1980 and future projections of climate change needs to consider natural internal variability as a factor of fundamental importance,"" Curry said. Still, and in contrast to Smitherman’s claim, the Daily Mail article closed by referring to global warming as ""real, and some of it at least has been caused by the CO2 emitted by fossil fuels. But the evidence is beginning to suggest that it may be happening much slower than the catastrophists have claimed–a conclusion with enormous policy implications."" Debate about reconsideration By email, Curry didn’t directly answer whether the globe is warming: ""There has been no statistically significant increase in global average surface temperatures for the past 17 years."" Per Curry’s point, Michael Tobis, an Austin software engineer whose blog, Planet 3.0, often brushes climate topics, said by email: ""There are strong indications that the deep ocean is heating more than anticipated, which would account for some missing warming at the surface… But it's crucial to understand this--the world has not wandered so far from what we expected as to require a deep reconsideration of the consensus"" that global warming persists. Tobis continued: ""There's no doubt that CO2 is piling up in the atmosphere. There's no doubt that human activity caused it. There's no doubt that CO2 is a major factor in how energy flows through the climate system, and that changing it leads to a changed climate. There's practically no doubt that in the long run the planet will end up substantially warmer than it is. Figuring out how it gets from here to there matters a lot to human beings who live out our brief lives during the adjustment period. And there are some uncertainties there--it turns out transitions are harder to calculate than final outcomes. But nothing we see reduces our confidence in our understanding."" Separately, the Texas state climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon, pointed out by email a National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration chart indicating a steady rise in ocean heat content, meaning temperatures averaged through the depth of the ocean, since the late 1960s. Like Tobis, though, Nielsen-Gammon said temperatures near the ocean surface have risen more slowly in the past 15 years or so ""than they had during the previous 35, and it is possible to find time intervals (such as the past five years) in which all weather station and satellite-based global temperature compilations show a declining trend. Overall, the global surface temperature trend is essentially flat since the dramatic and unusual warmth of the 1998 El Niño year. Nielsen-Gammon’s email continued: ""Just about everyone, including some of the sources quoted in the articles you listed,"" meaning the articles noted by Smitherman’s consultant, ""believes that the present lack of surface temperature warming is both natural and temporary. Climate model projections have generally been higher than observed temperatures, which depending on your interpretation means that natural variability has temporarily masked some of the warming or that the models have overestimated the amount of non-natural warming. The causes of the discrepancy are the subject of considerable research."" Cherry-picking a time period Our own online search led us to a Sept. 10, 2013, commentary by Forbes magazine staff writer Alex Knapp taking Rose to task for focusing too closely on short-term temperature changes. On the suggestion that global warming paused in 1997, Knapp wrote: ""Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ‘All of the top ten warmest years in the record have occurred since the last major El Niño event, in 1998.’ What’s more, according to NOAA, ‘Since 1976, every year including 2012 has had an annual temperature above the long-term average.’ In fact the two warmest years on record are 2005 and 2010, and the years between 2000 and 2010 had higher average temperatures than the years between 1990 and 1999. ""To show the continued rise of global average temperatures over the decades, this chart from the World Meteorological Organization helps to make it pretty clear: ""These rising temperatures have serious consequences. Rising temperatures melt glaciers on land, including Greenland and Antarctica. As those melts make their way to the oceans, they cause sea levels to rise. And those rising sea levels are real and have been measured. Here’s a chart of sea level rise since the 1880s – you can see the steadily rising trend for yourself. ""The bottom line is that, as I wrote last summer, ‘In the end, everything about climate science boils down to one simple fact: all else being equal, increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in a mixture of gasses will cause the mixture to absorb more heat.’"" Knapp closed: ""For our planet, that means as more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, the warmer the planet will get. Sure, there might be some short term anomalies – one year might be cooler than its preceding year, for instance – but the long term trend remains…"" Texas and U.S. climatologists Broadly, the Texas climatologists we reached said Smitherman got it wrong. ""The Earth is warming,"" Nielsen-Gammon said. By email, Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, called Smitherman’s claim incorrect, adding: ""First, climate is defined as the average over 20-30 years or more precisely because atmospheric scientists know that short-term natural cycles in the rates at which heat is exchanged between the ocean and atmosphere can lead to variations in global air temperature over shorter time scales."" Hayhoe and Tobis each cautioned that cherry-picking start and stop years can lead to factually skewed conclusions about temperature trends.""If you cherry-pick short periods of time, you can end up with nearly any result you want,"" Hayhoe said. ""Only by looking at the entire dataset can you see what the truth is."" Hayhoe noted, too, that a study accepted for online posting by the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Metereological Society on Nov. 12, 2013, shortly before Smitherman wrote his email, indicates that global temperatures have been underestimated since 1997 because they did not correctly reflect Arctic warming. Hayhoe further said the proper measure of warming extends past ocean or air temperatures alone. She pointed us to a chart posted on the Skeptical Science website, which focuses on touting peer-reviewed science related to climate change and debunking arguments built on incomplete information. The chart indicates that based on data published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres in September 2009, the ocean and earth have been warming for the past 50 years. Curiously, the state commission chaired by Smitherman, which regulates oil and gas exploration, has a section of its website detailing scientific concerns about greenhouse gases and global warming. A source note on that site led us to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a federal effort launched by Congress in 1990 to coordinate and integrate global change research across 13 government agencies.  We then downloaded a draft ""climate assessment"" report from the program, dated Jan. 11, 2013, including a letter to the American people stating: ""Long-term, independent records from weather stations, satellites, ocean buoys, tide gauges, and many other data sources all confirm the fact that our nation, like the rest of the world, is warming, precipitation patterns are changing, sea level is rising, and some types of extreme weather events are increasing,"" the draft said. Another part of the draft, prepared by the 60-member National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee, said: ""Evidence for climate change abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans. This evidence has been compiled by scientists and engineers from around the world, using satellites, weather balloons, thermometers, buoys, and other observing systems. The sum total of this evidence tells an unambiguous story: the planet is warming. U.S. average temperature has increased by about 1.5°F since 1895; more than 80% of this increase has occurred since 1980. The most recent decade was the nation’s hottest on record."" Previous fact checks From another vantag point, recent fact checks do not support Smitherman’s statement. PolitiFact New Jersey in July 2013 rated as True a claim that every ""single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average"" and that all ""12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years."" Those statistics were backed up by data released by NOAA scientists and NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. As for the warmest years on record, NOAA scientists estimate that the last 15 years have included the 14 hottest years and NASA scientists have said that same time period included the 13 hottest years. A month later, though, PolitiFact Rhode Island rated as Half True a claim that global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years. This held up partly due to the cherry-picked and short timeframe, which swept in 1998, the El Niño year that made surface temperatures exceptionally warm. When you start near an unusually hot year, there's a good chance that subsequent years will be cooler. That fact check considered major climate databases including one from NASA and another from the Hadley Centre of the Met Office, which is the United Kingdom's National Weather Service. It also tapped a tool available at SkepticalScience.com, whose Temperature Trend Calculator page allows users to pick from among several sets of temperature data and pick various timeframes. Hadley showed a .170 degree increase over those 16 years and NASA's numbers showed a .251 rise. Neither increase exceeded what could have happened by chance. Upshot: The global temperatures that were rising so rapidly in the 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s appeared to have stalled. In fact, the Met Office had begun referring to the latest 16 years as ""the recent pause in warming."" Officials there had issued three reports to try to explain the plateau. They stressed that the last decade was still the warmest on record and asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, although the agency is not offering a timetable. Said physicist Robert Brecha, of the University of Dayton: ""There is increasing evidence in the peer-reviewed literature that over the past decade or so more thermal energy is going into the deep ocean, rather than into the atmosphere. This is almost certainly just a temporary, cyclical process. The key point is that additional greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth system, keeping that energy from flowing back out to space,"" Brecha said. ""So if the atmosphere doesn't receive that heat [thereby increasing its temperature] that trapped energy is nevertheless building up."" For our part, we rated as Pants on Fire a legislator’s April 2013 claim that science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem. To the contrary, scientists have agreed for years that such gases contribute to atmospheric changes driving climatic warming. Naomi Oreskes, then a professor of history at the University of California, San Diego, sent us a chapter of a pending book updating her 2004 look into scientific consensus about climate change. A portion of the chapter said: ""Scientists predicted a long time ago that increasing greenhouse gas emissions could change the climate, and now there is overwhelming evidence that it is changing the climate."" However, ""to say that man-made global warming is underway is not the same as agreeing about what will happen in the future. Much of the continuing debate in the scientific community involves the likely rate of future change."" ""There are climate scientists who actively do research in the field but disagree with the consensus position,"" the chapter later says, ""but their number is very, very small."" We also contacted Oreskes for this article. She passed our inquiry to Richard Somerville, a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, who emailed us calling Smitherman’s claim ""nonsense."" Somerville wrote: ""It is just plain foolish to focus on short-term distractions in the climate record due to natural variability, while ignoring the long term-trend due to human activities."" Somerville described Smitherman’s offered articles as unscientific, adding: ""They misrepresent or ignore what climate science has actually discovered(.)"" By email, Craighead of Smitherman’s campaign responded by stressing afresh the Easterbook presentation indicating a global cooling period since 1999. Our ruling Smitherman said the Earth is not warming. To the contrary, national, international and Texas climate authorities concur that the planet is warming. They also warn against cherry-picking individual climatic indicators or timeframes to conclude otherwise. That makes sense to us. In the end, this claim strikes us as both unfounded and ridiculous.

Cumberland, R.I., Mayor Daniel McKee says town has highest bond rating in its history
","When Cumberland Mayor Daniel McKee launched his campaign for lieutenant governor Nov. 13, he cited the town’s financial progress during his administrations. As evidence of his managerial capability, McKee claimed that his administration restored his town’s credit rating after it dropped into junk bond territory in 2001. ""Our town has recovered from a five-point bond downgrade and now enjoys its highest bond rating in history,"" he said in his candidacy announcement, a claim he has repeated multiple times. First, some background. McKee has been mayor of Cumberland for 11 years --  a four-year stretch from 2000 to 2004, and then again from 2006 until the present. The bond rating recovery claim dates to his first four years in office. Bond ratings are important to municipalities. When a city or town wants to build a new school or an addition to a police station, it raises that money by selling bonds to investors. Ratings services such as Moody’s analyze the issuer’s tax base, budget stability and financial management, coming up with a grade that reflects their opinion of the issuing municipality’s ability to pay the investors back. An ‘A’ rated bond would be considered a safe choice, attractive to risk-averse investors who may be willing to accept a lower interest rate in exchange for a surer return. A lower rated ‘B’ bond, however, would be seen as less safe and the issuing town may have to pay a higher interest rate to attract buyers. When he was initially elected in 2000, Cumberland had already been in financial trouble for three years. In 1997, the town had drained a $1.4-million surplus fund to cover a deficit and still wound up $147,940 short That prompted Moody’s to drop the town’s bond rating from A1 to A3 in 1998.   The rating company uses a letter system to rate bonds, with multiple steps. The best rating is Aaa1. The lowest is C3. Aaa bonds, in Moody’s words, ""demonstrate the strongest creditworthiness."" Below Baa level is junk bond status. During its bankruptcy, Central Falls was rated Caa1, signifying ""very weak creditworthiness."" Cumberland’s municipal finances were struggling in 2000. A series of news reports noted that revenues were not coming in as expected, the town’s audit reports were late and one estimate predicted a deficit equal to a tenth of the town’s overall budget, ""which is an enormous amount,"" an analyst at Moody’s told The Providence Journal at the time. In January 2001, barely three weeks into McKee’s first term, Moody’s cut the town’s bond rating five steps, to Ba2. Ba rated bonds, in Moody’s words, ""demonstrate below average creditworthiness."" A Moody’s-rated Ba bond is familiarly known as a ""junk bond."" The crawl back began in March 2002. A completed audit showed revenues coming in better than expected, and the town implemented a series of cost-cutting measures as well as centralized management of town departments’ spending. Moody’s upgraded the rating to Baa3, one step out of junk bond status. By December 2004, the rating had improved to where it was in 2000, before the downgrades began. McKee said that was important to him because it came as he was leaving office, and it fulfilled a campaign promise. Two years later, in 2006, McKee won the mayoralty back and has been there since. In April 2010, Moody’s classified the town’s bond rating as A1, the top of that classification, where it remains. But is that the highest in its history? Checking back in Moody’s records, David Jacobson, a Moody’s spokesman, said Cumberland had an A rating in 1996, but that was before the firm added the three numbers to each letter grade. He said a direct comparison to a 2004 rating would not be exactly apples-to-apples. He said that was also the case with the Cumberland’s April 2010 upgrade to A1. It was because of an adjustment of the standards, not a change in Cumberland’s finances, he said. Our ruling Cumberland Mayor Daniel McKee said the town has ""its highest bond rating in history."" We found that, as far back as comparable statistics can be found -- about 17 years -- he’s right. The facts also support his claim that the bond rating improved five points under his administration. In addition to the Moody’s A1 rating in May, the city got an AA- rating from Standard and Poors in August. McKee said that during his 30 years in local government, he has no memory of the town ever getting an AA- rating from that service. But Cumberland has been a town for 267 years. It’s possible that at some point in that history, the town had a credit rating that, by some contemporary measure, was higher than its current rating.   McKee cited evidence going back a few decades, not for two centuries of history. For that reason, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/dec/13/daniel-mckee/cumberland-ri-mayor-daniel-mckee-says-town-has-hig/

O'Reilly: 'Denver Post' hired an editor to promote pot
","The Denver Post’s decision to hire a ""pot editor"" to cover the legal recreational use of marijuana in Colorado has drawn the ire of Bill O’Reilly, who twice in four days attacked the newspaper on his Fox News program. Among other things, O’Reilly called the Post’s top editor a pinhead and warned that the paper was promoting intoxication that would put more dangerous drivers on the road. ""The Denver Post has actually hired an editor to promote pot,"" O’Reilly exclaimed on Monday’s show. Both of his guests on Monday’s show pushed back. Mary Katharine Ham argued that this was a legitimate matter of public policy. Juan Williams said since pot would soon be legal in Colorado, talking about it would be no different from the wine reviews you can find in many newspapers. O’Reilly would have none of it. ""You can drink wine without getting inebriated,"" he said. The only reason to use marijuana, O’Reilly said, ""is to get high."" We reached out to Fox News for more details from the show and did not hear back. This fact-check focuses on whether the Denver Post is promoting pot, but O’Reilly and his guests raised some important points and we’ll cover some of them too. Reporting vs. endorsing We should be clear that O’Reilly did not say the Post’s coverage would have the unintended effect of encouraging the consumption of marijuana. He said promotion was the newspaper’s intent, calling the Post a ""very far left concern."" We can never be entirely certain when it comes to intent but here is how the newly appointed editor, Ricardo Baca, described the scope of his mandate. ""We will have voices in the mix from all sides of the story,"" Baca said in an article published by his paper. ""You smoke (or eat or vaporize) everyday. You got high once in high school and never again. You stopped after you had kids but are thinking about returning. You’re anti-pot and wish it weren’t one of the biggest issues in Colorado. I want to talk with all of you."" Baca promised that the beat would cover cannabis culture and news ""from a professional, journalistic and critical point of view."" So yes, the Post will have a freelance pot critic and a freelance pot adviser, but it will also use staff reporters to follow how the legalization of marijuana unfolds in the state that has gone further than any other (although Washington runs a close second). Colorado’s unique status makes the Post’s work very intriguing to Dr. Eric Wish, director of the Center for Substance Abuse Research at the University of Maryland. ""People have been debating this for a long time and there’s been no place where we could have an experiment to see what happens.,"" Wish said. ""Now the voters made Colorado the experiment. Anything that the Denver Post can do to inform people of the consequences of this experiment is going to be good. We need  to know."" The Post’s editor says he expects the new beat to engage the public. That can mean many things. Safe to say, the newspaper plans to attract readers. That’s a long way from encouraging people to use marijuana. Comparing cannabis and alcohol Coloradans voted on a measure that aimed to treat marijuana the same as alcohol. Opponents, such as O’Reilly, would maintain that the two chemicals are so fundamentally different, we should never confuse them in our minds or our laws. We can’t resolve that dispute, but our research did produce some useful data. First, coverage of beer, wine and spirits is widespread. Barbara Fusco, director of sales and marketing at the Brewers Association, a beer trade group, searched one database and found 168 reporters and editors who report on beer, wine and spirits at daily newspapers nationwide. ""I’d consider this number low, as it doesn’t include magazines, newswires, blogs, websites or broadcast outlets,"" Fusco said. ""Of those, 168 reporters, 60 are specifically identified as covering beer."" That’s about twice as many beer reporters from five years ago when the association said fewer than three dozen papers had regular coverage. Arnie Robbins, executive director of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, says based on what he’s seen, newspapers are expanding the space they give to all kinds of alcoholic drinks. ""On the New York Times baby boomer blog they have a column called A Quiet Drink,"" Robbins said. ""They cover where can you find a cool bar that isn’t crazy loud and it’s about the drinks there."" We visited A Quiet Drink and read about an ""iced black tea made with Jim Beam bourbon, simple syrup and cardamom pods"" and a mai tai ""with two kinds of rum — Zacapa 23 and Cana Brava — and a pleasant undercurrent of orange, from Creole Shrubb liqueur."" To our eye, this wouldn’t seem to discourage drinking. But O’Reilly’s main point was that you can drink without getting drunk while getting stoned is the only reason to smoke pot. This made us curious. Can we calibrate the effects of alcohol in ways that we can’t with pot? ""It may be a false dichotomy to say you can do it with alcohol but not marijuana,"" said Wish at the University of Maryland. Wish pointed to reports of people who have used marijuana medically and were given the choice of using pills or smoking the drug. They said they were able to control the effects more precisely by smoking. Wish has many concerns about the consequences of legalization. He warns about the combined impact on driving with both alcohol and marijuana in the blood stream. He says if legal pot is taxed at too high a rate, it could encourage the use of cheaper synthetic cannabis which can be a very risky compound. But as to our relative ability to manage our consumption of alcohol and marijuana, he says we should not assume we do a great job with either. ""I’m not so sure people calibrate so well once they get inebriated,"" Wish said. Our ruling O’Reilly said the Denver Post was a ""far left concern"" that had ""actually hired an editor to promote pot"". This goes to the newspaper's intent. The Denver Post said it planned to cover many aspects of the unfolding story of legalized marijuana in the state, ranging from policy and laws to the culture of pot users. While that coverage has yet to unfold, the stated goals of the Post do not match O’Reilly’s description of the newspaper’s intentions and we heard nothing from the show that supported O’Reilly’s view. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2013/dec/12/bill-oreilly/oreilly-denver-post-hired-editor-promote-pot/

Dan Gelber says Charlie Crist got automatic restoration of felon rights for 1st time in Florida history
","As former Gov. Charlie Crist tries to gain supporters in his quest to unseat Republican Gov. Rick Scott, he wants to portray himself as the hero of voter access and Scott as a leader who restricted voting. Dan Gelber, a former state House Democratic leader from Miami Beach and a Crist supporter, praised Crist for helping felons restore their civil rights, which includes the right to vote: Gelber wrote that Crist, as governor, ""sought for and got approved the automatic restoration of felon rights for nonviolent offenders for the first time in Florida history (since reversed by Governor Scott)."" At PolitiFact our Truth-O-Meter ramps up when we hear any claims about a ""first"" so we wanted to check if Gelber’s claim was correct. History of restoration of felon rights Restoring felons’ civil rights can include the right to vote, serve on a jury and run for office. The roots of disenfranchisement for ex-offenders extend back to 1845 when Florida’s General Assembly enacted a law that stated: ""no person who shall hereafter be convicted of bribery, perjury, or other infamous crime, shall be entitled to the right of suffrage."" In the mid 20th Century, a small number of ex-offenders could get their rights restored by the Parole Commission. By 1968, the Constitution placed that power in the hands of the Cabinet. In the 1970s, there was pressure from the Legislature on Gov. Reubin Askew, a Democrat, to make it easier to restore civil rights. Legislators passed a bill in 1974 that included automatic reinstatement, but the Florida Supreme Court declared that unconstitutional because it bypassed the governor’s clemency power. Askew then convinced the Cabinet to amend the clemency rules to make restoration easier. Randall Berg, a civil rights attorney at the Florida Justice Institute, told PolitiFact that Askew was motivated by a personal belief that ""after one had served their time, they had paid their debt and ought to start with a clean slate so they might become productive members of society."" Askew also wanted to speed up the process. The Cabinet restored rights in its role as the Executive Clemency Review Board, but meetings were only held quarterly, and the process was slow. ""There were simply too many people to determine who got their civil rights restored and who did not,"" Berg said in an email. The 1975 rule that Askew promoted included automatic reinstatement after a person was released from prison or parole, with the exception of the right to own or possess firearms. Each month, the Cabinet signed orders to grant restoration of civil rights. In 1977, the wording was changed to allow members of the Clemency Board to object to restoring a particular individual’s rights. A timeline from the state’s Parole Commission explains how the rules changed after Askew. In the early 1990s, Gov. Lawton Chiles tightened the rules, which made it harder for ex-felons to regain their rights. (That happened amid the backdrop of prison overcrowding, which led the state to release prisoners early.) Gov. Jeb Bush then took steps to simplify the process. (For example the application shrank from 12 pages to one.) But advocates said there was more to be done. Crist changes In April 2007, Crist convinced the Cabinet to streamline the process. ""Some who favor the current system argue that restoring civil rights is somehow ''weak on crime,"" as if restoring the right to vote, to serve on a jury or to work lessens the punishment or encourages a person to commit new crimes. In fact, the opposite should be true,"" Crist wrote in a Miami Herald op-ed. ""Giving a person a meaningful way to re-enter society, make a living and participate in our democracy will encourage good behavior."" Under Crist, ex-offenders convicted of less serious offenses could regain their rights without a hearing, while those convicted of crimes such as murder required a more thorough investigation and a hearing. Though some news articles used the word ""automatic"" to describe this process, that’s an oversimplification, because the Parole Commission had to approve it. Some advocates argued that Crist’s change didn’t go far enough. Under Crist, there were more than 150,000 restorations, but a backlog of 100,000 remained when he left office, according to the Tampa Bay Times. In February 2011, newly elected Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi argued that the process was too easy for released felons. One month later, Bondi, Scott and the rest of the Cabinet scrapped the process and set a minimum of a five-year waiting period. During Scott’s tenure through mid September, about 850 offenders have had their rights restored. Gelber’s response We contacted Gelber and told him that our research showed Askew sought restoration of felons’ voting rights before Crist did. Gelber told PolitiFact that he was unaware of Askew’s actions in 1975 and did some additional research; he said he found some differences between the restoration rules under Askew and Crist. (One difference related to some wording under Askew that required an ex-con to be a resident of Florida for one year, but that paragraph was in a section related to offenders who were not U.S. citizens.) ""While there are some debatable distinctions, I think my statement unfairly diminishes Gov. Askew's efforts,"" Gelber told PolitiFact in an email. ""The truth is, both men deserve high praise for what they did because the position they advocated is often unpopular and requires a measure of political courage. I have revised my statement to pay homage to Gov. Askew while at the same time congratulating Gov. Crist."" Here is how Gelber re-worded the claim: ""as Governor he convinced the Cabinet to approve the automatic restoration of felon rights for nonviolent offenders for the first time since Gov. Reubin Askew implemented a similar reform in 1975 (since reversed by Governor Scott)."" Our ruling Gelber said that Crist ""sought for and got approved the automatic restoration of felon rights for nonviolent offenders for the first time in Florida history."" First, a minor quibble: the restoration of felon rights under Crist was not automatic because the Clemency Board still had to sign off on it. However our main objection to Gelber’s statement is his claim that Crist was the ""first"" to do this in Florida history. In 1975, Askew and the Cabinet changed the rules to allow for ""automatic restoration"" of rights for voting. Under Askew, the changes broadly applied to offenders, whether they had completed sentences related to violent or nonviolent offenses. Crist’s policy favored nonviolent offenders. Depending on your viewpoint it was Askew who earned kudos or criticism -- not Crist -- for making it far easier for felons to regain civil rights including the right to vote. Gelber changed the wording of his claim in response to this fact-check. At PolitiFact, we give props to people who admit to errors and correct them, but that doesn’t change our analysis or rating of the original claim. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2013/dec/12/dan-gelber/dan-gelber-says-charlie-crist-got-approved-automat/

UPDATED: Cornyn backed Wall Street bailout and law hiking taxes for many, but he's opposed Obamacare and occasionally spurned increases in debt ceiling
","As U.S. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas drew a surprise challenger, a political action committee suggested the second-term senator hasn’t always voted right. Shortly before the Dec. 9, 2013, filing deadline for Texas candidates, U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman of Friendswood withdrew his filing to seek re-election and instead submitted paperwork to challenge Cornyn and others for the party’s 2014 Senate nomination. Politico said in a news story posted that day that Stockman’s entry could force Cornyn ""to tack farther right as he tries to win over a corner of the party that has recently been skeptical of him."" The story later quoted a representative of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a PAC founded by former Republican Sen. James DeMint, as heralding Stockman’s foray into the race. ""We haven’t decided yet whether we will endorse Steve Stockman, but we’re glad he is running,"" Matt Hoskins, the group’s leader, said in a statement. ""Texas deserves two conservative fighters in the Senate, not just one. John Cornyn has voted to increase the debt, raise taxes, bail out Wall Street banks and fund Obamacare. He’s part of the problem in Washington and voters deserve an alternative."" Votes to hike the debt and taxes, bail out banks--and to fund Obamacare? We were curious. Bailout vote Let’s get the bailout, um, out of the way. On Oct. 1, 2008, Cornyn was on the prevailing ""aye"" side of the Senate when the body voted 74-25 in favor of a $700 billion package to rescue the financial markets, including Wall Street banks. He and fellow Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison both voted for the proposal. On May 17, 2010, CNN quoted Cornyn as sticking by his support for the Wall Street bailout program that subsequently turned out to be unpopular with voters. The measure, Cornyn said, ""was represented to us as an absolute necessity or else the economy would melt down and we'd experience a repeat of perhaps the depression of the '30s. I'm responsible and proud of the vote I cast at the time because I thought it was a public necessity."" Cornyn noted to CNN, though, that he later voted to end the Troubled Asset Relief Program ""even though I voted for it initially because I think it's been abused and I think the American people are experiencing bailout fatigue and now we're being asked to share in part of the bailout of Greece through the International Monetary Fund through our contribution there. So I don't blame people who are upset with the way that the bailouts have grown and been abused. But I think at the time it was the right decision to make."" He added, according to CNN: ""People understand that sometimes you have to make unpopular decisions of necessity. At the time it was the right decision to make."" Increasing debt Has Cornyn voted to increase debt? By email, Hoskins pointed out that on Aug. 2, 2011, Cornyn voted to increase the federal debt limit by $2.4 trillion. Historically, Congress raises the debt limit so the government can continue paying its creditors. And, as Josh Gordon of the Virginia-based Concord Coalition, which focuses on fiscal policy, reminded us by email, votes to lift the ceiling are not the same as raising debt. ""The vote to increase the debt ceiling has no bearing on levels of debt--which are determined by votes for spending policy and tax policy,"" Gordon wrote. ""By the time it comes to vote on the debt ceiling, the decisions to increase the debt have already been made, and the debt limit increase is just allowing the country to continue operating economically."" Regardless, congressional debates leading up to the latest debt-limit hikes have been boisterous with Republican opponents saying the increases wouldn’t be acceptable without simultaneous spending cuts. According to online Senate vote tallies, though, Cornyn voted against the latest debt-limit bump, approved  by the Senate Oct. 16, 2013. Then again, he voted for the August 2011 hike noted by Hoskins and earlier voted in favor of Congress raising the limit on May 23, 2003; on Nov. 17, 2004; and on March 16, 2006, Senate tallies show. On the flip side, he also voted against the measure raising the limit as approved by the Senate by 53 to 42 on Sept. 27, 2007 and against another successful increase, wrapped into housing reform legislation, on July 26, 2008. An Oct. 15, 2013, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service lists half a dozen other votes to raise the debt limit with Cornyn in the Senate; we didn’t check on how he stood on those. Raising taxes On Jan. 1, 2013, Hoskins said, John Cornyn voted for the ""fiscal cliff tax hike that raised taxes by $600 billion and forced nearly 80% of Americans to pay higher taxes,"" referring to the American Taxpayer Relief Act. As noted in a Jan. 2, 2013, Associated Press news article, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C., estimated that 77 percent of U.S. households would face higher taxes overall thanks to the approved act, mostly because the law did not extend a temporary reduction in the Social Security payroll tax worth about $1,000 to a worker making $50,000 annually. Hoskins cited a Jan. 1, 2013, blog post by the conservative Heritage Foundation for his $600 billion figure, which the post described as the amount of additional federal revenue the government expected to reap over 10 years thanks to the measure. The act had multiple elements, as summarized Jan. 1, 2013, by The Washington Post. Most significantly, income tax rates were permanently increased for families with annual incomes above $450,000 and individuals earning more than $400,000, but rates did not change for taxpayers earning less. The wealthiest Americans also had to start paying a higher tax on capital gains and dividends. Among other features, the law left the payroll tax break for employees to expire, the Post noted, while temporary business tax breaks—benefiting everything from R&D and wind energy to race-car track owners—were extended a year. In a Jan. 1, 2013, statement issued after he voted, Cornyn said: ""I voted for this bill because it prevents a huge tax increase on 99% of all Texans and Americans."" He was referring to income tax rate reductions put in place under President George W. Bush being preserved for all but the super-rich. ""Nonetheless,"" Cornyn said, ""I am dismayed at the lack of seriousness by the president on dealing with the core issues of our fiscal problems. Our spending is unsustainable and it is high time the president and his party engage in meaningful dialogue to get this county's spending under control."" Funding Obamacare The Obamacare law, formally the Affordable Care Act, came to be in 2010 without drawing a single Republican vote and Cornyn, like many Republicans, has been a critic/foe of the law widening access to health insurance in part by requiring most Americans to purchase coverage. Hoskins said, though, that Cornyn twice voted to fund the law. On March 20, 2013, Hoskins noted, Cornyn voted for final passage of the fiscal 2013 appropriations act, with first-term Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and 25 other senators voting no. And on Sept. 27, 2013, Hoskins said, Cornyn voted to bring Senate debate to a close on the fiscal 2014 appropriations act ""and to allow an up-or-down vote on the Democratic amendment to fund Obamacare."" Cruz and 16 other senators voted no. By email, Cornyn campaign spokesman Drew Brandewie pointed out a July 29, 2013, analysis by the Congressional Research Service indicating that failures to fund the government might not have stopped spending related to the Obamacare law. According to the analysis, U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., had asked the service what would happen to the health care law’s implementation in the event of a lapse in appropriation funding, resulting in a government shutdown. The service replied that ""substantial"" implementation might continue because the government could draw on other funding sources and agencies are permitted to continue to perform certain activities even if appropriations are stalled. Also, the service, said, after the government asked Congress for more than $1 billion to implement Obamacare provisions in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2013, no such money was appropriated; the government found the dollars from other federal kitties. If Congress similarly resisted an administration request for $1.4 billion in implementation money in fiscal 2014, the service said, ""it seems likely that the administration will continue to rely on alternative sources of funding to support"" Obamacare ""activities."" Our ruling The PAC said Cornyn ""has voted to increase the debt, raise taxes, bail out Wall Street banks, and fund Obamacare."" It's not that simple. Cornyn voted for the 2008 bailout and has occasionally voted to raise the debt ceiling. Also, Cornyn’s 2013 vote for the taxpayer-relief act raised taxes for most households though, signficantly, it also preserved lower income-tax rates than ones that would have hit if the measure didn’t make it into law. Finally, the idea that Cornyn voted to fund Obamacare by agreeing to general appropriations is a political turnip; how those votes are interpreted probably depends on one’s political prism. Beyond that, the government evidently can tap the funding it needs to implement the law regardless of congressional spending decisions. Cornyn voted against the Obamacare law when it came to be and continues to oppose it. We rate this partially accurate claim, which takes some votes out of context, as Half True. CORRECTION, 1:13 p.m., Dec. 12, 2013: This story has been amended to reflect Cornyn’s vote against raising the debt ceiling in October 2013. This change did not affect our rating.

Barbara Lee says 60 percent of people on food assistance are working
","Following President Barack Obama’s recent speech on the economy, CNN’s Crossfire roundtable debated how to shrink the income gap. Talk centered mostly on the minimum wage. U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., told host Newt Gingrich she supports a raise to $10 an hour so that people can support themselves and their families. ""First of all, $7.25 an hour. Can anyone live off that?"" Lee said. ""Secondly, I just have to say, 60 percent of people on food assistance are working. They're part of the working poor."" We wanted to take a closer look at what percentage of people receiving food stamps (also known as SNAP, for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) are working. Lee’s spokeswoman pointed us to a January 2013 report on the relationship between SNAP and employment put out by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit liberal think tank. Finding the right data The report analyzes food stamp data from two different sources: SNAP Quality Control Household Statistics and the Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program Participation. Lee’s 60 percent figure comes from the census survey. That’s data the census obtained by calling households. They assessed the work rate of individuals from households receiving food stamps in a typical month and the year before and after. The survey is longitudinal, so it’s designed to show how the work rate changes over time in these same families. The SNAP data set, on the other hand, isn’t longitudinal. It’s information collected by the Department of Agriculture, and it’s meant to show a snapshot of what the work rate looks like at a single point in time. The data includes a sample of families from each state, but it’s not the same families included every time. Both data sets highlighted in the report are from 2005, so the author could use an apples-to-apples comparison. If the SNAP data isn’t longitudinal, why not just use the Census survey to show what’s happened to the work rate over time? Dorothy Rosenbaum, the author of the report, said the SNAP data is more reliable and more recent. So what’s the right percentage? Lee’s 60 percent doesn’t refer to the entire population of food stamp recipients. Rather, it refers to the subset of recipients who are ""expected"" to work -- that excludes children, the elderly and the disabled. That distinction makes sense, since including the groups that never work wouldn’t be a reliable way to track the change in the work rate. Let’s compare what the SNAP and Census data show about the percentage of people on food stamps who work (out of those expected to), but let’s keep in mind that this data is pre-recession: 43 percent, SNAP numbers indicate. 58 percent, Census numbers indicate. In a report footnote, Rosenbaum averaged the two statistics and said that, as of 2005, half of all food stamp recipients expected to work were working. The average is close to what Lee mentioned, but she selected the higher of the two numbers available. We’ve also got 2011 numbers that weren’t officially released by the Census or SNAP: 42 percent for SNAP and 56 percent for the Census, Rosenbaum said, based on public use data she accessed. So by both accounts, things haven’t changed much since the year Lee took her data from. Although all this data excludes those with disabilities, people with disabilities who don’t receive benefits from programs like Veterans Affairs, Social Security or Supplemental Security Income are still in the category of those expected to work. If all adults with disabilities were moved to the proper category of the data, the work rate percentage would shoot up to a more accurate value. Our ruling Lee said 60 percent of people receiving food stamps are working. She should’ve specified that she meant 60 percent of the pool of recipients expected to work. Her figure’s a little high, but anywhere from about 42 to 58 percent is a reasonable summary of the report’s findings and more recent data available. We rate her statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/dec/11/barbara-lee/barbara-lee-says-60-percent-people-food-assistance/

Bill O'Reilly says Nelson Mandela 'was a communist'
","It’s been almost a quarter century since the Cold War ended. But the recent death of Nelson Mandela has stirred up quite a few old ideological ghosts. When high-profile Republicans including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz released statements of praise for Mandela after his death on Dec. 5, 2013, they were deluged with negative comments by Americans who felt Mandela was either a communist, a terrorist or both. On Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor just hours after Mandela died, host Bill O’Reilly discussed Mandela’s legacy with former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. The exchange got the most attention for Santorum’s comment equating Obamacare with apartheid -- namely, that ""we have a great injustice going on right now in this country, with an ever-increasing size of government that is taking over and controlling people’s lives. And Obamacare is front and center in that."" In this item, however, we’ll be fact-checking a different claim -- the one by O’Reilly that preceded that statement. Mandela, O’Reilly said, ""was a communist."" Before looking into the claim, we will note that O’Reilly’s point was more nuanced than this fragment in isolation. O’Reilly said, ""Nelson Mandela -- I spent some time in South Africa. He was a communist, this man. He was a communist. All right? But he was a great man. What he did for his people was stunning -- the sacrifices that he made. He could have repudiated and got out of that prison. He wouldn't do it. He was a great man. But he was a communist."" So was he? We checked with seven scholars of Mandela and 20th century South African history, and most agreed that Mandela was -- at least for a while -- a member of the Communist Party. However, they added that the label is far from the sum of a very complex political leader. There has never been much question that the South African Communist Party was an ally of Mandela’s African National Congress. ""The Tri-Partite Alliance -- the African National Congress, the South African Communist Party and the labor federation COSATU -- cooperated closely in the fight against apartheid,"" said Douglas Foster, author of After Mandela: The Struggle for Freedom in Post-Apartheid South Africa. But the question of whether Mandela himself was actually a member of the Communist Party has always been murkier. Stephen Ellis, a British historian based in Amsterdam, made waves in 2011 when he published a paper that concluded that Mandela had been a member of the South African Communist Party. The paper was controversial, in no small part because Mandela had suggested throughout his life that he was not. For instance, during Mandela’s trial for treason, the South African government accused him of being a communist. He had his lawyer challenge the accusation, and it was withdrawn, said Danny Schechter, author of Madiba A to Z: The Many Faces of Nelson Mandela. In a Dec. 7 column, Bill Keller of the New York Times quoted Mandela saying, ""If by Communist you mean a member of the Communist Party and a person who believes in the theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, and who adheres strictly to the discipline of the party, I did not become a Communist."" To Keller, this answer was ""both evasive and perfectly accurate."" By the time of Ellis’ paper, Mandela was too ill to be asked about it publicly. But among scholars at least, lingering doubts about Ellis’ finding were largely washed away the day Mandela died. Upon Mandela’s death, the South African Communist Party released a statement of mourning that revealed that, ""at his arrest in August 1962, Nelson Mandela was not only a member of the then-underground South African Communist Party, but was also a member of our Party's Central Committee."" Tom Lodge, a professor at the University of Limerick and author of Mandela: A Critical Life said Mandela ""joined the SACP probably in late 1960, early enough to be involved in its decision to adopt a strategy of ‘armed struggle.’ It seems that he had second thoughts about his membership while touring Africa in early 1962."" It’s unclear whether Mandela ever formally resigned, Lodge said, but ""certainly by the late 1960s, the Communist Party no longer regarded him as a member."" In its statement, the South African Communist Party called him ""a great and close friend of the communists till his last days,"" a phrasing that suggests that he wasn’t actually a party member any longer. There is no indication he was a party member at the time he was elected president after being released from prison. So the weight of the historical evidence is that O’Reilly was correct to say that Mandela ""was a communist."" But scholars told us it’s important to leaven this with a few bits of context. • Mandela was not a communist ideologue. ""Mandela is the least ideologically rigid leader I have ever encountered,"" said John Carlin, author of Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation. ""He was the very opposite of a fanatic. He showed immense respect for all political points of view and never to my knowledge believed he had the answers to the problems of human life, much less the key to heaven on earth, as his Communist brethren might have done."" Indeed, Carlin said, during Mandela’s 27-year imprisonment at Robben Island, he ""had long and heated debates with the one big South African Communist Party figure imprisoned there, Govan Mbeki."" Foster said that even if Mandela was officially a Communist Party member for a time, he would not have defined himself that way. ""Nobody who has even a passing familiarity with South African history, and Mandela's role, would describe him as someone with mixed loyalties,"" Foster said. ""He was a disciplined, true-blue member of the ANC through his entire adulthood."" • For decades, there were few allies Mandela could have sought out in the fight against apartheid. At the time Mandela would have been a South African Communist Party member, all liberation groups (including the Communist Party) were banned. And within this small group of opponents of apartheid, only the Communist Party was multiracial. ""The Communist Party in South Africa was attractive to some because it was the only nonracial party at the time for activists who didn't want to be defined ethnically,"" Schechter said. ""For many years, the ANC was only for Africans, the Indian Congress for Indians and the Congress of Democrats for Whites."" Indeed, Keller writes that the legacy of nonracialism was one of the most valuable legacies of Mandela’s alignment with the Communist Party, since it made racial reconciliation possible after the toppling of apartheid. (Keller also lists other, less positive legacies, including ""remnants of Communist protocol and jargon (that) live on in the platform and demeanor of South Africa’s ruling party."") • The Communist Party – due in part to its long fight against apartheid – does not have the same negative connotation in South Africa that it does in the United States. Former South African President F.W. DeKlerk -- who worked with Mandela to end apartheid -- told Schechter that Communist Party leader Joe Slovo ""played a pragmatic and crucial role in engineering the compromises that led to a political settlement. … All this ‘commie’ talk obscures more than it reveals."" In fact, ""half the members of the present cabinet in South Africa are party members,"" Lodge added. ""It really isn’t an issue."" Our ruling O’Reilly said that Mandela ""was a communist."" The weight of the historical evidence shows that O’Reilly is correct. For a time, Mandela -- despite his denials -- appears to have been a member not only of the party but also of its central committee. However, it’s worth noting that Mandela’s affiliation with the party or its goals was never a dominant feature of his ideology or message.

Does the middle class include those with income between $20,000 and $60,000?
","Every election season, politicians seek to renew their love affair with the American middle class. Proposals, stretching from ""middle-class tax breaks"" to tuition tax credits for ""middle class"" parents of college students, fill the airwaves. Trouble is, there’s no definition of this group that everyone can agree upon. The meaning of the term, depending on who is using it and for what purpose, can be stretched like a rubber band. ""There’s not really a definition of what constitutes middle class,"" Aparna Mathur, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., wrote in an email. ""It’s more of a notional concept of how you view yourself relative to others."" Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, for instance, last year set the upper-end figure for middle class membership at a household income of $250,000 a year. President Barack Obama set the bar a little lower, at $200,000. Actual income levels around the country make both of those figures high. The Oregon Business Association made ""rebuilding the middle class"" the top priority in its recently unveiled 2014 work plan. That goal is critical, according to the Portland-based association, because middle-class jobs took the biggest hit during the Great Recession and have been slowest to grow in the recent expansion. When it came to defining terms, the association said this: ""The middle class can be defined to include those with income between roughly $20,000 and $60,000."" The $60,000 figure sounded about right, despite Romney’s and Obama’s  definitions, but $20,000 struck us as low. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We called D.J. Vogt, the business association’s legislative director. He said the figures came from a chart in a recent state Office of Economic Analysis report showing the bulk of ""middle income"" wages for various occupations in Oregon falling between $20,000 and $60,000. ""I was including anything that could be considered middle class,"" Vogt said. ""I took the broadest possible income level to put a number on it."" We then called Mark McMullen, Oregon state economist, who co-authored the report that Vogt relied on. He noted that nowhere did the term ""middle class"" appear. ""We stick to calling them middle-wage jobs,"" McMullen said. ""We don’t want to make any inference about spending power or quality of life given those income levels."" In addition, he said, the term is simply too loaded politically to serve a useful research purpose. But what about saying that the ""middle"" of Oregon’s income scale is bookended by $20,000 and $60,000? A review of 2011 Oregon tax returns, the most recent year for which information is available, puts the business association on firmer ground, McMullen said. Oregon Revenue Department figures for 2011 show the high end of each quintile -- the standard slicing of income ranges into fifths, with each quintile having roughly the same number of tax filers -- looks like this: So while the association’s high-end ""middle class"" figure looked pretty solid, its low-end $20,000 looked dubious. Someone earning that much a year is actually near the bottom of the state’s income scale. For reference, we also checked federal statistics, which place the poverty threshold at $11,490 for a single-earner and $23,500 for a family of four. So someone earning $20,000 might be in poverty if they’re supporting others, or not far off. Not a great place, in other words, to be calling the middle-class home. Mary C. King, a Portland State University economics professor, disputed the idea that $20,000 a year, even for a single-earner, can be called middle class. However, she acknowledged the same stumbling block others identify, that ""middle class"" can be as much of an idea as a definable economic reality. ""Still,"" she said, ""that just makes no sense at all. That’s $10 an hour. No one is getting a mortgage on $20,000 a year."" The median income for all U.S. households last year was just over $51,000, she noted, and the average was about $71,000. PolitiFact has waded into this territory before and agrees there is no official definition of ""middle class."" Is it having a home mortgage? Being able to afford two cars or send kids to college? We’re still not certain -- and neither are most economists, as indicated by Mathur’s email reply -- but we do think the term has its economic limits. And those limits don’t extend anywhere near the official poverty range, as the business association’s $20,000 does. The association’s upper end of $60,000 is much more solid, though, landing well above the median income level for all Oregon tax filers and roughly in the middle of Oregon income levels. We also need to allow for households with two wage-earners -- one with two people earning $20,000 each, for example, could more realistically be considered part of the middle class.

Rush Limbaugh says Obamacare will cause an increase in the divorce rate
","If you think divorce is prevalent now, just wait. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh says marriage in the United States is poised to crumble for a whole new reason. Yes, the culprit is Obamacare. The point came up as Limbaugh chatted with a caller from Jacksonville, Fla., on his Dec. 6, 2013, talk show. Jim the caller: ""Greetings, Rush. My concern is about unintended social consequences of the Obama No Care Act. Think about it. There's supplements for having a lower income. ... Will there be an incentive not to be married or to get divorced? You'll get incentives on the Obamacare side."" Limbaugh: ""You know, you are very shrewd, Jim, because there is a story we had, it might have been late last week, that people are divorcing in order to afford Obamacare. It is busting up families. Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate."" We decided to fact-check Limbaugh’s claim that ""Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate."" A month-old anecdote The news story Limbaugh referenced was about a New York couple considering a divorce so they could qualify for subsidies individually to offset the cost of health care under the new law. The story did not address Limbaugh’s claim that the health care law will increase the country’s divorce rate, leading us to wonder if there is credible research to support his assertion. The early verdict: Experts say there is no evidence or research that suggests the health care law will grow the divorce rate. But the law does contain a ""marriage penalty,"" which essentially means unmarried couples could pay less for health insurance because they have separate, smaller incomes than married couples whose combined income exceeds the cut-off for federal financial assistance. And at least one couple considered divorce to avoid increased health care costs. Emphasis on ""considered."" The Atlantic spotlighted one married couple to illustrate the ""marriage penalty"" disparity, and a CBS affiliate in New York picked up the story the next day. Writer Nona Willis Aronowitz told the magazine she got married in 2009 so her freelance filmmaker-husband Aaron Cassara could receive health insurance through her employer. But her job ended when her employer laid off her editorial division. The layoff left her with a COBRA plan that was more expensive but allowed her to maintain temporary health coverage at a group rate. Faced with a Jan. 1 end date for that coverage, which did not extend to her husband because it cost too much, she checked out her options on the New York health insurance exchange set up under the health care law. She and her husband earned more than 400 percent of the 2012 federal poverty level, or $62,040 for a family of two, which made them ineligible for premium assistance. Under the law, people whose family income is between 100 and 400 percent of federal poverty are eligible for premium support. However, had they not been married and sought health insurance on their own, their individual incomes would have qualified for them for subsidies because they would have been under the cut-off income for one person, or $45,980. ""In our case, it would be worth it,"" Aronowitz said of getting divorced to CBS2. ""In other people’s cases, where marriage is really, really important to them and they had a big wedding and it was this sacred experience, I think it would be a really tough decision for them."" We reached out to Aronowitz to find out what’s happened in the month since word of her story broke. Aronowitz told PunditFact she recently obtained a full-time job and can now afford health insurance for her and her husband in 2014 on the state exchange. The couple, therefore, is not seeking a divorce. Broader impact? The health care law is not the first government program to have a ""marriage tax"" issue. It also comes up under current U.S. income tax law and for programs such as food stamps, temporary cash assistance and others. Whenever eligibility for a program depends on a sliding-scale subsidy based on income and family size, there is the potential for ""encouraging"" couples to marry or not marry, said Gail Wilensky, director of Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush. Teasing out the effect of the Affordable Care Act marriage penalty on divorce rates would not be easy. ""My guess is that at the most, this kind of effect is more annoying than impactful. You would have to be pretty indifferent as to whether you married or didn’t marry to have tax or subsidy consequences determine your decision,"" Wilensky said. ""But small is not the same as none."" In the case of health insurance, marriage actually also brings benefits. Married couples have more access to insurance, as many large employers offer family plans that extend to an employee’s married spouse and dependents. That’s why Aronowitz said she and her husband got married in the first place. According to an October 2013 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the percentage of uninsured married adults is about 15 percent of the population, compared to 33 percent for single adults living together. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said married couples are most affected by the ""marriage penalty"" when two things happen: Neither person is eligible for affordable health insurance under an employer's plan, and the couple is eligible for a more sizable government insurance subsidy as two unmarried adults rather than as a married couple. But the law also contains some ""marriage bonuses,"" similar to U.S. tax law, he said. Some companies will feel compelled to offer health insurance to their employees so they do not face tax penalties. Many will offer family insurance plans, which would be enticing for the married spouse of an employee, Burtless said. ""I’m sure we’ll hear anecdotes over the next few months and years, and I’m sure some of the anecdotes will be described in occasional press stories,"" Burtless said. ""But it will be many years, if ever, before a careful examination of the evidence shows whether the ‘marriage penalty’ in the ACA has a bigger impact discouraging marriage or encouraging divorce than the ‘marriage bonus’ in the ACA has in encouraging marriage or discouraging divorce."" Limbaugh’s statement is ""pure conjecture"" at this point, said Andrew Cherlin, a professor of public policy and sociology at Johns Hopkins University. ""It could also have a positive effect on marriage, as it lowers health insurance premiums for low-income couples (who have a higher divorce rate) and as it makes people healthier, which could increase their earnings,"" Cherlin said. ""We don't know what the balance will be."" Divorce statistics are a whole other matter. The country does not keep comprehensive data. One measure is the rate of divorce per 1,000 population. The divorce rate was 3.6 divorces per 1,000 population in 2011, according to rough numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, those CDC statistics are imperfect because several states do not report divorce and annulment data to the feds, including the most populous state of California. Divorce has been on the decline since 1980, said Brad Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia. Marriage has become more selective, and more couples are living together without getting married. Couples who are better educated and more affluent are more likely to get married and are less likely to divorce, he said. ""So if Obamacare exacts a major marriage penalty on couples, it may increase divorce at the margins,"" he said. The oft-repeated stat that 50 percent of marriages end in divorce is essentially true for the overall population, but the odds decline when factors such as college education, religious affiliation, home life and marrying at a later age are considered, according to a 2012 report by the National Marriage Project and the Center for Marriage and Families at the Institute for American Values. An October 2013 report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found the likelihood of a marriage ending in divorce a bit lower, between 40-45 percent. We emailed Limbaugh's show but did not hear back. Our ruling Limbaugh said, ""Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate."" There is concern about a ""marriage penalty,"" which exists for other federal programs with sliding income eligibility scales, with the Affordable Care Act, and there is anecdotal evidence that at least one couple considered divorce to avoid it. (The postscript: She got a new full-time job and can afford insurance on the exchange, so they’re still married.) But there is no research that suggests this will substantially affect the country’s divorce rate, which is a little hard to measure in the first place. Experts said the effect may be marginal, as no one has done the research to nail down reasonable expectations.

Meek says Greene only voted four times
","Congressman Kendrick Meek wants voters to view him as the true Democrat in his U.S. Senate primary against billionaire Jeff Greene. In a June 22, 2010, debate between the two candidates hosted by the Palm Beach Post, Meek said of his opponent:""The first time he ever voted as a Democrat was here in Florida in 2008. He only voted four times in his life, and he's asking Floridians to come out and vote for him.""Greene's run as a Republican in 1982 in a Congressional primary in California isn't in dispute. And the Truth-o-Meter previously ruled a separate claim by Meek that Greene had only lived in Florida for two years as True. But we wondered, did Meek accurately summarize Greene's voting record -- is it true that the 55-year-old Greene has voted only four times in his life?We did our homework, checking voting records to determine how many times -- and under which party affiliation -- Greene voted.First we contacted the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk to ask for a history of Greene's voter registration and record. Greene registered as a Republican with an address in the city of Los Angeles in 1982, said spokeswoman Monica Flores in an e-mail. In 1992, he re-registered with an address in Malibu and changed party affiliation to ""Decline to State."" Flores provided copies of his 1982 and 1992 registrations. He voted in the 1992 general election, 2000 primary and general elections and the 2004 general election, Flores wrote. That's four elections in California, and Greene campaign spokesman Paul Blank says Greene voted for Democrats -- Bill Clinton, Al Gore and John Kerry -- in those presidential races. Another Greene spokesman Luis Vizcaino said Greene also voted in the 1982 Congressional primary, which he lost, but Flores said her office's voting history information only extends back to 1992.We contacted Miami-Dade County Supervisor of Elections. Christina White, director of the office of governmental affairs, told us in an e-mail that Greene registered as a Democrat in Miami Beach on March 20, 2008. He voted Nov. 4, 2008.We contacted Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher to ask when Greene registered in the county where he now lives. On April 14, 2010, he changed his address to Palm Beach, Bucher said. Bucher said Greene had previously registered to vote as an NPA (No Party Affiliation) in 1977 at Century Village in West Palm Beach. The office does not have any record of him voting affiliated with that registration.Vizcaino told us that the only county that Greene registered in in California was Los Angeles County and that the only other state he registered in was Florida. We e-mailed our findings to Vizcaino who disagreed with one part regarding registration: Greene says he registered in West Palm Beach in 1973 as a Democrat -- though Bucher said he registered in 1977 as an NPA. Vizcaino asked Greene about the discrepancy. Vizcaino said Greene replied: ""If that's what they have, I must have changed it at some point. I don't know why. I am certain I was a registered Democrat.""The Greene campaign sent us this response to our query about his voting history and registration: ""Jeff voted in some elections and missed some elections, voting in 4 out of the last 5 presidential elections. Jeff is an outsider and wasn't focused on politics, he was focused on building a successful business and creating jobs.""So where does that leave us?Meek said that the first time Greene voted as a Democrat was in Florida in 2008. Based on voter history information we found in California and Florida dating back to 1992, that's true. Meek also claimed that Greene ""only voted four times in his life."" We found five times: 1992, twice in 2000 and 2004 in California and once in Florida in 2008. Greene's campaign said he voted in 1982 when he ran for office. We think it would be strange if he ran for Congress and didn't vote for himself, but Los Angeles did not keep such records before 1992. Greene says he first registered as a Democrat in 1973 -- but Palm Beach records show 1977 as an NPA. Based on available records, Greene voted at least five times, likely six times -- not four.

Scalise blames Obama for 'inaction' on berm plan to contain oil spill
","Many Republicans say President Barack Obama has moved too slowly in response to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., criticized the president's Oval Office speech and cited slow action in building sand barriers to absorb the oil.""Tonight the president actually said that he won't tolerate inaction,"" Scalise said on Sean Hannity's show on Fox News shortly after the speech on June 15, 2010. ""Yet it was his inaction that caused over three weeks to go by before he even approved the governor's plan to protect our marsh and put up those sand barriers which covered 25 percent of the plan that was submitted by our local leaders."" Scalise is referring to a plan proposed May 11 by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal that the federal government build barrier islands of sand to intercept oil before it hit Louisiana's wetlands. The plan is based on the idea that oil is easier to get out of sand than wetlands, which are an important part of the state's ecosystems. (Read our previous ruling on Jindal's plan here.) We were interested in determining how long it took Obama to implement Gov. Jindal's plan. Now some people have questioned whether Jindal's entire plan could be completed quickly enough to capture the oil before it reached the wetlands. Some scientists have also warned that in the long term, the berms could do more harm than good. They could change coastal currents and further degrade the already extremely fragile coastline. Some suggested that construction of the berms could damage oil and gas pipelines and  that dredging the sand to build the berms could cause a change in water salinity that could harm  the fish population.Although Scalise refers to ""inaction,"" records indicate that federal agencies have been assessing the proposal since May 11.The Corps of Engineers says it received the plan at 11 p.m. on May 11. The Corps solicited interagency comments in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, and provided those comments to the state of Louisiana. On May 14, the state resubmitted a revised plan based off of the comments. The Corps then solicited a second round of comments and began to discuss technical analyses with the state. On May 21 and May 24, the state submitted additional information, and on May 27, the plan was approved to build berms in six of the 24 proposed sections. On June 2nd, the White House approved of the idea that BP would pay and on June 3rd, BP agreed to pay the estimated $360 million cost. That certainly seems like quite a bit of action to us.According to Scalise spokesman Stephen Bell, Scalise was counting from May 11 to June 3, when BP agreed to pay, because the governor never planned to pay for the berms at the cost of the Louisiana taxpayers. According to that math, the time would be just over three weeks. But we think it's important to note that the Army Corps of Engineers approved Jindal's plan on May 27, two weeks and two days after he proposed it. And then it was June 3 when BP agreed to cover the cost. Scalise said President Obama's ""inaction ... caused over three weeks to go by before he even approved the governor's plan."" It's the word ""inaction"" here that is most troubling because it suggests nothing was going on when in fact something was happening to address Jindal's idea. Per protocol, the Corps solicited interagency comments, shared them with the state of Louisiana, received a revised plan, solicited comments on it and then approved the plan May 27. Within a week, the money was in place. The omission of this context leads us to rule Scalise's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/29/steve-scalise/scalise-blames-obama-inaction-berm-plan-contain-oi/
"['Georgia', 'John Albers']","
State Senate candidate says he ran ""large parts"" of a $5 billion business
","Recent reports in The Beacon, a newspaper that covers north Fulton County, drew attention to what could be a whopper. John Albers, a Republican candidate for District 56 state senator, said during a campaign forum that he ran a $5 billion division of AT&T, it reported. The problem was that Dick Anderson, who once ran a major division of AT&T, happened to be in the audience. Anderson, who backs one of Albers' opponents, told The Beacon, and later PolitiFact Georgia, that he never heard of Albers and couldn't find any telecommunications executive who did. Ouch.Albers said he was taken out of context. He added that Anderson's claim should be disregarded because he is partisan. So, did Albers really say he ran a huge telecom operation when he didn't? We had to find out. Albers is running for an open seat vacated by Dan Moody (R-Johns Creek), the state Senate's majority caucus chairman. Moody was first elected to the seat representing the Roswell area in 2002. Witnesses said Albers made the statement during a forum hosted by the Chattahoochee Republican Women's Club on March 23. PolitiFact Georgia could find no recording of the event, but attendees including the president of the club, a reporter from The Beacon, Republican District 56 candidate Brandon Beach, and Anderson, who donated to Beach's campaign, all told us that Albers said he ran a large division of the company that was worth lots and lots of money. Later, at a forum hosted by The Beacon, Beach challenged Albers on his resume. Albers' reply was videotaped, and The Beacon's publisher John Fredericks sent PolitiFact Georgia a copy. ""Now, I've learned in my politicking that you do get taken out of context all the time,"" Albers said. ""I did work at AT&T, I did rise through the ranks very rapidly, and I was responsible for large parts in a $5 billion organization. ""Now, I didn't even know Dick Anderson, so I'm guessing he didn't work anywhere close to our company. But when you have a $98 billion budget and 350,000 employees, you tend not to know too many folks."" The Beacon published a follow-up story on Albers' credentials June 12. We interviewed Albers afterward. He softened his description of his role at AT&T, saying he said he ""helped manage"" a $5 billion division of AT&T. Albers told PolitiFact Georgia that he started with the company in 1993 as a telecommunications equipment installer in Louisville, Ky. He moved up swiftly and left after his division became part of Lucent Technologies. He said his final post there was as a manager of workers who maintained electronic systems used by engineers. ""I was booted up the ranks very quickly,"" Albers said. A spokeswoman for what's now called Alcatel-Lucent confirmed much of what Albers told PolitiFact Georgia. He was ""part of the business that did installation, maintenance, engineering and a wide range of professional services,"" according to an e-mail response to our inquiry. He worked for a part of AT&T dubbed ""Network Systems,"" and his title was ""Network Capacity Planning Manager."" Lucent did not provide information on how many people he supervised.So did Albers tell the truth? Only after he was taken to task. As scrutiny of his resume grew, Albers demoted himself from executive whiz kid to manager. Based on accounts from attendees of the Chattahoochee event, a video recording from The Beacon forum, and our interview of Albers, the candidate gave three different versions of his resume: that he was in charge of a big business organization; that he was a ""responsible for large parts in a $5 billion organization""; and that he was a member of management. Only this final description squared with Lucent employment records. In response, Albers said PolitiFact Georgia focused too closely on one word—“large”—and re-asserted that he played a significant role at AT&T. He added that we were giving too much credence to attacks made by his opponents and their backers. Albers' claims that he was part of the billionaire-dollar business executive set were wishful, at best. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2010/jun/29/john-albers/state-sen-says-he-ran-large-parts-5-billion-organi/

Kyl says American Bar Association calls for 12 years of experience in practice of law
","As the confirmation hearings began on June 28, 2010, for Elena Kagan's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee made the point that Kagan -- the current Solicitor General, a former dean of Harvard Law School and a member of the Clinton White House staff -- may not be a wise choice because she has relatively little experience as a judge or a practicing attorney.""Ms. Kagan has never served on any bench,"" said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. ""Indeed, except for a brief two-year stint in private practice and one year as solicitor general, Ms. Kagan's entire career has been divided between academia and policy positions in the Clinton administration. Given this lack of experience practicing law, I was surprised that the American Bar Association awarded her a well-qualified rating, since the ABA's own criteria for a judicial nominee call for, among other things, at least 12 years' experience in the practice of law, and they mean actual practice of law, like former Justices [William] Rehnquist and [Lewis] Powell.""We thought it would be worth checking the ABA's guidelines ourselves to see what they say.First, let's take a quick look at Kagan's resume. While she is perhaps best known as the former Dean of Harvard Law School and as an aide in the Clinton White House, she does have a number of experiences that would qualify as the practice of law.From 1989 to 1991, she was an associate at Williams & Connolly, a Washington, D.C., law firm, doing mix of commercial, First Amendment and white-collar criminal law. And since March 2009, she has been solicitor general, arguing cases before the justices she hopes to join.Meanwhile, some people might also classify her two judicial clerkships -- for Judge Abner Mikva, U.S. Court of Appeals for D.C., and for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall -- as ""courtroom experience.""She also spent three summers working for three private-sector law firms in New York City. And you could also classify her work as associate counsel to President Bill Clinton to be the practice of law, in the sense that she was advising a client, the president. (Her later policy work for the White House would probably fall outside of the practice of law.)Put these all together, and her total time spent pursuing the pure practice of law, as opposed to positions merely related to the law, would come to somewhere between five or six years. As Kyl indicates, that is indeed short of 12. Now for Kyl's claim about the ABA endorsement. We downloaded a copy of a pamphlet published by the 15-member ABA panel that scrutinizes the records of appointees to federal judgeships and rates them as either ""well qualified,"" ""qualified"" or ""not qualified."" (The ratings aren't binding, but they carry weight among many of the senators who ultimately vote on federal judgeships. The pamphlet, ""The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary: What It Is and How It Works,"" details the criteria used in the panel's evaluations.""The committee's evaluation of prospective nominees to the federal bench is directed solely to their professional qualifications: integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament,"" the pamphlet says. It goes on to say, ""The committee believes that a prospective nominee to the federal bench ordinarily should have at least 12 years’ experience in the practice of law. In evaluating the professional qualifications of a prospective nominee, the committee recognizes that substantial courtroom and trial experience as a lawyer or trial judge is important. Distinguished accomplishments in the field of law or experience that is similar to in-court trial work — such as appearing before or serving on administrative agencies or arbitration boards, or teaching trial advocacy or other clinical law school courses — may compensate for a prospective nominee’s lack of substantial courtroom experience.""So there is some truth in Kyl's statement. The ABA panel's ""own criteria"" do indeed ""call for, among other things, at least 12 years' experience in the practice of law,"" as Kyl put it. What he said also fits with the idea that the ABA panel ""recognizes that substantial courtroom and trial experience as a lawyer or trial judge is important.""But Kyl's statement leaves out what we think is an important qualifier -- that ""distinguished accomplishments in the field of law or experience that is similar to in-court trial work — such as appearing before or serving on administrative agencies or arbitration boards, or teaching trial advocacy or other clinical law school courses — may compensate for a prospective nominee’s lack of substantial courtroom experience.""We realize that distinguished alternate career paths, by the panel's definition, ""may compensate"" for having less than 12 years of practice -- not ""will compensate."" But Kagan can make a pretty good argument that she has compensated for not having 12 years’ experience in the practice of law by instead satisfying the standard of ""distinguished accomplishments in the field of law."" She has, after all, served as U.S. Solicitor General, Dean of Harvard Law School and as a White House counsel -- at least three positions that we think most people would classify as ""distinguished"" achievements of a lawyer's career.When we called Kyl's office, spokesman Ryan Patmintra argued that these experiences aren't related to the ""practice of law"" envisioned by the ABA panel.""To the best of my knowledge, Ms. Kagan has not appeared or served on 'administrative agencies or arbitration boards,' nor has she taught 'trial advocacy or other clinical law school courses.' She has, of course, taught traditional law school courses, but those are very different from the trial advocacy or clinical courses that the ABA is referring to — i.e., classes that would demonstrate an understanding of the courtroom process.""We didn't comb through her semester-by-semester course loads or pro-bono assignments to track her practical legal work, but we think this line of argument is a red herring anyway. The sentence sets up two alternatives -- either ""distinguished accomplishments in the field of law or experience that is similar to in-court trial work."" We see no requirement that the ""distinguished accomplishments"" be directly related to the in-court practice of law.Ultimately, then, Kyl is correct to say that the ABA does ""call for"" 12 years of practical law experience. But he leaves out an important qualifier -- that there's a way around that through ""distinguished accomplishments in the field of law.""

"['Corporations', 'Economy', 'Financial Regulation', 'Florida', 'Jeff Greene']","
Greene claims banks need derivatives to make loans
","A derivative a day keeps the bad economy away. That seemed to be the message from Jeff Greene during last week's Democratic U.S. Senate debate between him and his opponent, Rep. Kendrick Meek. Talking about the subprime mortgage crisis, Greene, a real estate billionaire and investor, touched on the topic of financial derivatives:""Do we have to regulate derivatives? Yes, we do. Cause when I did this in my investments, frankly, no one knew who could pay who. But derivatives have an important place in our economy. If there were not derivatives, there would be no bank loans at all today, because people want to get fixed-rate 30-year loans, but banks don't want to keep 30-year loans on their books,"" said Greene. Derivatives have recently gotten a lot of criticism in the press for helping to fuel the ongoing economic crisis, so we wondered whether Greene was right that banks need them to make loans.First, however, a little primer on ""derivatives."" The conversation could become very technical very quickly, so we'll just say that a derivative is fundamentally a contract between two or more parties. The value of the contract depends on (i.e. is derived from) some other asset. If you think that the U.S. housing market is on the verge of collapse, you can use derivatives to make a bet that will pay out only if you prove to be right. If you're wrong, you'll lose the money. In this context, banks can use derivatives as a form of insurance policy -- if the borrower defaults on his home loan, for example, the bank won't crumble because the derivative will pay out instead. That said, let's look at Greene's statement. We contacted numerous experts on finance, most of whom told us pretty much the exact same thing: Banks have been making loans way before derivative use became widespread, and as long as there is money to be made, banks will continue to make them. ""A claim that banks won't make (sound) loans without derivatives is ridiculous,"" wrote Lynn A. Stout, professor of corporate and securities law at UCLA. John Cochrane from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business specifically said that ""banks made lots of 30-year loans many years ago before ... derivatives were even invented.""Still, Greene wasn't completely off when he said that eliminating derivatives now could impact lending. Don Chance from Louisiana State University said that he agrees with Greene's underlying point but disagrees with the wording. It is likely that banks would ""significantly"" reduce giving out both long- and short-term loans, said Chance. Peter DeMarzo from Stanford agrees. ""Eliminating all derivatives would ... very likely significantly reduce loan-making activity,"" wrote DeMarzo. Cochrane emphasized that derivatives allow banks to make more loans and to do so more efficiently. It is also thanks to derivatives that banks can offer loans to clients who are considered more risky, such as first-time homeowners.Nevertheless, even without derivatives to help them hedge against risk, banks could still give out loans, even the 30-year fixed interest mortgage loans that Greene specifically referenced in the debate. Kenneth French from Dartmouth College said that if derivatives suddenly disappeared, the banking sector would undergo lots of restructuring, but ""almost all the banks that remain would continue to make loans."" Jeff Greene said that ""if there were not derivatives, there would be no bank loans at all today."" Many of the experts we spoke with told us that Greene's underlying point that using derivatives makes it easier for banks to issue long-term loans is sound. Still, there was a consensus that Greene did take his argument too far by categorically declaring that banks would stop making loans. Banks were making mortgage loans before the derivatives that Greene was talking about even existed, and they would continue to make them even if derivatives disappeared tomorrow, albeit perhaps in decreased quantities.

"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'John McCain']","
McCain says Phoenix is the second kidnapping capital in the world
","
Will Congress answer President Barack Obama’s call to tackle immigration reform this year?

""Not until we get the borders secure,"" said John McCain, R-Ariz., on NBC’s Meet the Press on June 27. ""By the way, on that issue, why is it that Phoenix, Arizona, is the number two kidnapping capital of the world? Does that mean our border's safe? Of course not.""

PolitiFact Texas earlier checked a similar statement by Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who recently rallied delegates at the Republican state convention by commiserating with Arizona, which has come under fire for its law that makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime.

""Phoenix, Arizona, I'm told, is now the No. 2 kidnapping capital in the world, right behind Mexico City,"" he said. ""That's unacceptable in America. We understand. We in Texas understand the frustrations people feel in Arizona.""

McCain’s office didn’t immediately respond to our query, but he’s made the claim before — and so have at least 20 news organizations, including the Associated Press, The Arizona Republic and United Press International.

Far as we could tell, ABC News broke the story, reporting on Feb. 11, 2009: ""Phoenix, Arizona, has become the kidnapping capital of America, with more incidents than any other city in the world outside of Mexico City and over 370 cases last year alone.""

Some media outlets attributed the news to ABC, while others just said Phoenix was ""known as"" the No. 2 kidnapping capital. The Los Angeles Times more specifically reported that Phoenix ""police received 366 kidnapping-for-ransom reports"" in 2008 and that they estimate ""twice that number go unreported,"" according to a Feb. 12, 2009, article.

But there's a hitch: None of the stories says how the kidnapping ranking was reached. Also, while all the stories specify the number of kidnappings that have occurred in Phoenix since 2008, none says how many kidnappings were reported in other cities.

We asked ABC to elaborate on its report, a request that didn't immediately yield supporting evidence when we first published this item two weeks ago. Meantime, we kept digging.

Neither the FBI nor the U.S. National Central Bureau of Interpol, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice that serves as the United States' representative to Interpol, could confirm that Phoenix has the second-highest frequency of kidnapping cases worldwide. LaTonya Miller, an Interpol spokeswoman, said the agency doesn't track local kidnapping rates. An FBI spokeswoman, Denise Ballew, suggested we call city police departments to compile a kidnapping count since unlike local authorities, the bureau tracks kidnappings that result in someone being taken from one jurisdiction to another, such as across state lines.

Short of the time we'd need to call authorities in every medium- to big-size city in the world, we contacted Daniel Johnson, an overseas kidnapping operations consultant at ASI Global, a Houston-based company that coaches clients through kidnappings. You read that right: Say an insured family travels to Bulgaria and the father is kidnapped for ransom; ASI Global will deploy to Bulgaria to help the family negotiate with the abductor.

Johnson said: ""From our internal experience in the last year, Mexico by far has been the biggest location for kidnappings"" followed by Honduras, Venezuela, Nigeria and the Philippines. The company has handled domestic cases but Thompson said they don't compare in volume to overseas incidents. Thompson said the company annually dispatches a consultant to handle about 50 to 100 cases a year. Mexico City, Caracas, Venezuela, and Tegucigalpa, Honduras are the three cities where they work on the most kidnapping cases, he said.

Scott Stewart, vice president of tactical intelligence for Stratfor, an Austin-based global intelligence company, separately chimed in: ""According to our analysts, there is no way that Phoenix is the No. 2 city in the world for kidnapping and there are significantly more kidnappings in many other cities throughout Latin America,"" he said. ""San Salvador, Guatemala City, Bogota as well as several cities in Mexico certainly have higher kidnapping rates than Phoenix.""

That said, Stewart said Stratfor doesn't track such kidnapping statistics, noting that it's ""extremely difficult to measure given the fact that so many cases go unreported and that the record keeping in many of the most effected countries is inaccurate."" The company bases its information on ""intelligence that we gather through our network of human and open sources, as well as the experience of our analysts,"" he said.

Johnson also said that generally, the problem with kidnapping statistics is there's ""no reliable empirical data"" and kidnappings are ""inherently under-reported, anyway."" Kidnappers nab someone and tell you not to tell the police, he said, adding that especially outside the United States, people typically don't report the incidents to law enforcement.

Among countries that track kidnappings, Johnson said, the definition of ""kidnap"" varies. An ""express kidnapping,"" for instance, can be classified as a prolonged robbery, he said. Someone takes to you against your will from ATM to ATM until your checking account is depleted. Robbery or kidnapping?

Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a public information officer at the Phoenix Police Department, also said kidnappings are under-reported. ""Herein lies the problem with the numbers,"" Thompson said. ""Does Bogota, Colombia, keep records? Does Mogadishu, (Somalia), keep records?""

He said Phoenix has been dealing with the issue for several years now, and the number of reported kidnappings have actually decreased since this story broke in 2009. There were 358 reported kidnappings in 2008 (10 fewer than reported by the LA Times, due to later reclassification of the crimes), 318 in 2009 and there were 105 from January through May 2010, he said, putting the city on track to sustain less than 300 this year.

Mindful that ""spillover violence"" from Mexico has become a politically-charged term in the U.S., Thompson said almost everyone who is kidnapped in Phoenix is involved in criminal activities such as illegal border crossings and the drug trade. ""Unless you're involved in the dope trade, there's a very very slim chance"" that you'll be kidnapped, he said.

""Everyone wants to tie it to their political agenda,"" Thompson said. ""Again, the two overwhelming questions are, do they keep records elsewhere in the world and are there more people — other agencies — across the nation who are even willing to talk about such a problem?""

""It was the media that said 'second in the world only to Mexico City,' and it was basically because we were open enough to say that we have an issue with kidnappings and not try to hide it,"" Thompson said.

True, ""Kidnapping capital"" is a headline-grabbing label. But so far, we've seen no evidence that it's accurate, or even close. And since we first considered this claim earlier this month, no one has stepped forward with more information.

Phoenix has experienced hundreds of kidnappings over the past few years. However, we couldn't find reliable around-the-planet evidence to confirm that only Mexico City experiences more of them. In fact, experts advise that such rankings can't be made based on available information. If they could, they speculate, other cities would prove to have more kidnappings than Arizona's capital.

We found nothing confirming Phoenix as No. 2 in kidnappings worldwide. We'll reconsider our rating if compelling evidence surfaces, but for now McCain's statement is False.",/factchecks/2010/jun/28/john-mccain/mccain-says-phoenix-second-kidnapping-capital-worl/

Sen. Mary Landrieu says U.S. doesn't allow open-water oil spill practice
","While discussing the continuing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico recently on Meet the Press, David Gregory asked Senator Mary Landrieu, ""Is there a problem here of a learning curve, Senator?"" Gregory added that ""we know the federal government's not equipped to stop the, the spill or plug the leak. You've got to have that level of expertise. But it does seem, and Thad Allen even referred to that in The Wall Street Journal this week, as if there is a learning curve because nobody's got the experience to deal with a large-scale spill like this."" ""We're all on a learning curve,'' Landrieu responded. ""I learned this week that Canada ... for instance, does spills into their water to practice in the event that this would happen. That is not allowed in the United States. Maybe we should think about that."" She added that ""this is like going through something where we've never had a fire drill."" We were curious about the two related claims: Whether Canada does such practice sessions in open water, and whether the United States does not. Canada does practice controlled oil spills in the open water. In a congressional hearing featuring Kevin Costner, the woman sitting to his left, Dr. Nancy Kinner, the co-director of the Coastal Response Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, mentioned that both Canada and Norway have controlled oil spills so that they can test new technologies. The United States does not share that capability with their neighbor to the north, according to Kinner. ""The United States is the only country that does oil spill R&D that has no opportunity to actually have on-water controlled spills to test technology,"" Kinner told members of Congress.  The Minerals Management Service confirms that ""the U.S. prohibits training with real oil in the open ocean or conducting testing of equipment, technologies or methodologies with real oil in the open ocean. In North America testing, training and research using real oil is conducted in test tanks and in laboratories."" According to the Evironmental Protection Agency, it is technically possible to obtain a permit to spill oil on the open ocean through the EPA, but that type of permit has not been granted for at least 20 years. As of now, the main training capability inside the U.S. is the National Oil Spill Response Research & Renewable Energy Test Facility, also known as Ohmsett. Real oil is used inside the training facility, but that is an enclosed system. The advantages of the Ohmsett system include the ability to control for all variables, allowing participants to test in a variety of different conditions. However, many experts, including Kinner, believes there is value to testing in the real world. ""I think we need to open up that possibility,'' she said, ""that we have small releases where we can have open water testing, outside of Ohmsett, to test the in real world conditions, instead of in a big test tank."" The U.S. does have the Ohmsett's testing facility, and MMS has participated in the open-water exercises in Canada and Norway, so Landrieu overstates the situation when she says it is the equivalent to never having a fire drill. Landrieu is right when she says that Canada practices in open water for oil spills, and that such testing is de facto prohibited here because the EPA has not issued a permit in two decades. Still, the application process does exist. It remains legally possible to ask for permission.

Ankrum says McCaul is the sixth-richest member of Congress
","
Painting his November opponent as an out-of-touch millionaire, Democrat Ted Ankrum invoked U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul’s wealth in remarks to the Democrats with Disabilities caucus at the Texas Democratic State Convention in Corpus Christi. 
The Austin lawyer ""is the sixth-richest person in Congress,"" Ankrum said Friday. 
We scurried to check. 
When we followed up with Ankrum, he immediately said he should have described McCaul as the sixth-richest member of the House — not all of Congress.  
How would Ankrum know? Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, annually examines financial disclosure filings by members of Congress and ranks the 50 richest members by calculating their minimum net worths. On the disclosure filings, members don’t reveal exactly what they’re worth. Instead, they indicate assets and liabilities within broad categories such as $1 to $1,000, up to more than $50 million. Roll Call estimates each member’s net worth by calculating the lowest possible total assets and subtracting the lowest possible liabilities. 
According to Roll Call’s latest assessment, based on members’ 2008 submissions, McCaul was then the 11th-richest member of Congress, and the sixth-richest House member. McCaul’s estimated net worth that year: $38.08 million.  
The sixth-richest member that year, according to Roll Call’s research, was Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado, with an estimated net worth of $71 million. 
""McCaul’s assets grew by at least $14 million in 2008,"" Roll Call said, ""a jump of nearly 60 percent from his reported minimum value the year before. McCaul holds the largest percentage increase in wealth among any member."" 
Roll Call also reported that many lawmakers on its top-50 list had suffered steep financial losses, reporting a combined loss of more than $275 million from their combined estimated net worths in 2007. 
Roll Call said McCaul’s boost in wealth reflected a significant jump in some of his wife’s investments, which were valued at a minimum of $25 million. McCaul’s father-in-law is Lowry Mays, the founder of media giant Clear Channel Communications. 
We checked in with McCaul’s campaign, whose spokesman Mike Rosen, didn’t quibble with the ranking.  
Overall, 28 Democrats and 22 Republicans made the publication’s top-50 list. The most flush member of Congress that year was Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., with an estimated net worth of $167.55 million. Other Texans in the money: U.S. Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Irving, ranked 25th with an estimated net worth of $11.89 million, Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, came in 35th at $7.14 million and Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Lubbock, landed 46th at $5.91 million.  
Summing up (ahem): Ankrum misspoke because McCaul, by the latest ranking, is the the sixth-richest member of the House, not Congress.  
Still, the punch line is about the same; McCaul was better off than most colleagues. We rate Ankrum’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/28/ted-ankrum/ankrum-says-mccaul-sixth-richest-member-congress/

Gubernatorial candidate touts record on education cuts
","Democrats woo few voting blocs as ardently as they do teachers. This primary-election season, with the governor's seat up for grabs, their ritual mating dance is noisy. State Attorney General Thurbert Baker plans to feather education's nest with funds from bingo games. Former Gov. Roy Barnes, who critics say lost his seat as governor because he lost the teacher vote, is singing the praises of educators. State Rep. DuBose Porter of Dublin is pushing his long record in the state House of Representatives, during which he became a darling of education advocacy groups for his positions on school funding. A blog post on his campaign Web site titled ""It all comes down to Education"" proclaims that ""Teachers need DuBose Porter as their Governor."" The post gives 11 reasons why. This was No. 6: ""Fought against $3 billion in cuts to public education since 2003."" Which cuts were those? we wondered. And how did he fight? This item puts Porter's reputation as a proponent for education to the test. A search of a decade's-worth of newspaper clippings and interviews shows he frequently argued against what he saw as too little education funding, and singled out Gov. Sonny Perdue in his attacks. This year, when the House passed the 2010 amended budget, Porter said that ""when we cut our teachers and we cut our schools, we shortchange our kids."" In 2009, he opposed cuts to special supplementary payments to teachers who undergo a rigorous national certification process.In 2008, Porter advocated for two bills that he said would have boosted the money going to schools by changing funding procedures. In 2007, he wrote a column for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution challenging Perdue on statewide SAT scores and what he saw as cuts to education. In 2006, he criticized Perdue for education budget changes he made during his first term as governor. Porter argued in 2005 that more money needed to go to schools and teacher salaries. State education advocacy groups think Porter fought for them. Herb Garrett, executive directorof the Georgia School Superintendents Association, was effusive in a recent e-mail. ""I can say without fear of contradiction that Representative Porter has, in fact, raised numerous objections to the cuts to education,"" Garrett said. ""He is among the most knowledgeable candidates on education funding [due to his many years of experience in the General Assembly and on education committees in particular], so he has a keen eye for how the education portion of the budget operates and when those in positions of power are playing games with it. He has called their hand publicly on a number of occasions."" You get the point. Checking Porter's opposition to school spending cuts of all stripes is easy.Now, figuring out whether those cuts were worth $3 billion is a messier business. Porter and his backers argue there were billions of dollars of cuts under Perdue's reign. Perdue's office says the governor actually increased school funding by about $1 billion.How is this possible? Thank the murkiness of education financing in Georgia. The state's 1985 Quality Basic Education Act established the formula the state uses to dole out money to local school systems for k-12 students. Each year, the state plugs numbers into the formula to determine how much money to give. But the state budget doesn't have to follow the formula. For instance, for the 2010 budget year, the formula determined the state government should put about $1.35 billion more than it actually provided, according to budget documents from the state Department of Education. Because the state provided less than the QBE formula suggested, Porter and other groups such as the Georgia School Superintendents Association have said Perdue cut school funding by that amount in that budget year. If you total the difference between what the QBE formula kicked out and how much was allocated from fiscal year 2003 through 2010, you end up with about $3 billion worth of cuts, a Porter campaign representative said. In fact, this $3 billion is a little low, according to a PolitiFact Georgia analysis. We found cuts were at about $3.25 billion. If you count the fiscal year 2011 budget, which was just passed this spring, those cuts are about $4.3 billion, according to the state School Superintendents Association. Here's the problem. Some people don't count cuts this way. One of them is the governor. Perdue's office sent us a spreadsheet that detailed how they calculate changes in QBE funding, which essentially subtracts the later year's QBE amount from the earlier number. The difference from 2003 to 2010 is about $1 billion. So how do we determine whether Porter's statement is true? Even though numbers aren't typically thought of as subjective, in this case, whether or not you believe the budget was cut by $3 billion or increased by $1 billion is a matter of perspective. The arithmetic behind both calculations is correct, but the assumptions behind them are very different.  For years, government types have argued whether a reduction in an expected increase counts as a budget cut. If you think it is a cut, you might believe the $3 billion number is correct because if the state fails to follow the QBE formula, they're shortchanging schools. Or you might think the formula is bunk and that it's important to give the state credit for increasing the overall amount by about $1 billion. Porter has consistently objected to what he saw as cuts to k-12 education that were the result of QBE funding shortfalls. He did so aggressively, calling out the governor by name.We rate Porter's statement True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/28/dubose-porter/gubernatorial-candidate-touts-record-education-cut/

Bill Lynch campaign claims Blue Cross spent $25 million for decor in its new $90-million office building.
","William ""Bill"" Lynch, one of the four Democrats running for Patrick Kennedy’s 1st District seat in the U.S. Congress, has been trying to rally support by repeatedly railing against Blue Cross, the health insurer whose double-digit rate increase requests have been widely condemned.The fact that Blue Cross is seeking the increase after building a towering headquarters near Providence Place mall, combined with rumors that the company spent lavishly on furnishings, has made it a tempting target.So Lynch has called on the health-insurance commissioner to deny the request, and his campaign issued a news release in May that included this statement:""Last month Lynch criticized the construction of Blue Cross’s new $90 million headquarters, which was outfitted with $25 million in decor.""That would buy some pretty cushy cubicles. We wanted to know if the $25-million figure was true.When we contacted the Lynch campaign, spokesman Bill Fischer said the number also includes furnishings, such as desks and office equipment, and the sources were a Providence Business News story, which he could not locate, and an Oct. 5, 2009, Providence Journal story.We checked the Journal story but there was no reference to $25 million being spent on anything.When we asked Fischer about that, he cited this sentence in the story:""But Blue Cross president and chief executive officer James E. Purcell is proud of his $90-million ($125 million when you include furnishings and ‘soft’ costs such as fees and engineering) building and insists it is actually saving money for the health insurer.""Fischer said the campaign arrived at the $25-million figure by taking the $35 million difference between $125 million and $90 million, then subtracting $10 million to be on the safe side. He said the Lynch campaign has repeatedly sought more reliable information from Blue Cross and the state Department of Business Regulation, which uses data from the health-insurance giant to rule on premium increases. But both, he said, have refused to disclose that data.""It’s the best information we could ascertain from the limited information Blue Cross will provide on this matter,"" said Fischer.No it’s not. It’s a number pulled out of thin air.Fischer added that Lynch has publicly repeated the $25-million claim in several venues, in news releases and on the radio. ""Not once did Blue Cross refute it,"" he said.They don’t have to. It’s up to a candidate to know what he or she is talking about. Repeatedly presenting rough guesstimates as hard facts does not make them true.""We stand by our number,"" Fischer said.And we stand by our rating: Pants on Fire. By the way, we asked Blue Cross how much it spent on furnishings and received this response from Kimberly R. Reingold, director of media relations and external affairs:""The cost characterization of our decor, including workstations, office furniture, tables, seating and files, is inaccurate. The actual cost was modestly in excess of $7 million.""Reingold said ""modestly in excess of $7 million"" means less than $7.5 million and was based on ""invoices received from multiple vendors.""We asked Blue Cross for documentation to back up that number.

Congressman quiet on MARTA, Jones says
","The population growth spurt in southeast DeKalb County over the past two decades has resulted in a grim reality: Traffic can be torture.In recent years, elected officials have talked about extending the region's rail service, MARTA, farther east in DeKalb to make commuting easier for area residents.Vernon Jones, a Democrat and former DeKalb County CEO who is running for Congress to represent the area, has complained incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson has not done enough to help MARTA since the congressman went to Washington in 2007.Here's one verbal volley by Jones from a June 3 candidate forum in southeast Atlanta: ""Four years as a congressman, he [Johnson] never talked about MARTA.""Never? Isn't that a little bit extreme?""You can't find anything where Hank has talked about MARTA,"" Jones said in a telephone interview last week.Well, PolitiFact Georgia decided to do a little exploring. A spokesman for Johnson, who represents Georgia's 4th Congressional District, sent PolitiFact Georgia a letter dated July 10, 2009, from the congressman to U.S. Rep. John Olver. Olver is a Democrat from Massachusetts who is chair of the House Appropriations subcommittee on transportation and other issues. Johnson asked for $9 million to help MARTA buy clean-fuel buses. Johnson also requested money for MARTA's I-20 East Transit Corridor and Clifton Corridor studies.""How much did [Johnson] get?"" asked Jones.Johnson testified before Olver's committee on April 15, making another pitch for the I-20 rail study. He also asked the committee for $12 million to help MARTA buy new buses, to repair others and for security cameras.""They're pretty inaccurate and unfair,"" Johnson's spokesman, Andy Phelan, said of Jones' claims.Jones and Johnson, most DeKalb politicos know, worked together on the County Commission. Jones was DeKalb's chief executive officer from 2001 to 2008. Johnson was a county commissioner from 2001 to 2006, representing much of southeast DeKalb.Since 2009, Johnson has been a co-sponsor of four separate pieces of federal legislation that obtained $5.725 million for MARTA, agency records show. The bulk of that money, $4 million, was for the acquisition of clean-fuel buses.Jones argued that Johnson has been a bit player in these efforts to get money for MARTA.""Hank is the least senior member [of the lawmakers who co-sponsored the legislation],"" Jones said. ""You cannot say he brought that money back [to Georgia].""Jones contends that Johnson did not get serious about his interest in MARTA until Jones began talking about the transit system on the campaign trail. Johnson was appointed earlier this year to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Shortly afterward, Johnson and his wife took a first-class trip on MARTA with the agency's CEO as his guide through the district.The fact remains that Johnson has talked about MARTA. The support of veteran congressmen such as Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson and Rep. John Lewis likely played a greater factor in getting the $5.7 million, but Johnson was a co-sponsor.If Jones had simply stated that he does not believe Johnson has done enough for MARTA, he might had dodged the Truth-O-Meter. But with his ""never"" declaration, the former CEO wandered right into the path of the dreaded device. Things are heating up in DeKalb County politics, it seems.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Ethics', 'Texas', 'Bill White']","
White says Perry broke promise not to take pay raise
","Bill White, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, lashed out at his GOP rival, Gov. Rick Perry, over his state-paid salary during a June 17 news conference, suggesting Perry had gone back on his word not to accept a five-figure raise. “Several years ago, he signed a law giving himself a $40,000 pay increase,” White said. “He told you, the people in the press, that he wasn’t going to take that pay increase. I don’t think he kept that promise.” We decided to review White’s left-right-left combination. In response to our inquiry, White’s campaign pointed us to Perry’s tax returns, newspaper articles and actions taken by the Texas Legislature in 2007. That year, lawmakers included raises for eight top officials, including the governor, in the budget bill for fiscal years 2008 and 2009, according to a Dallas Morning News article published June 7, 2007. Perry signed the legislation into law June 15, 2007, according to information from the Legislature’s Web site. In the law, the governor’s annual salary was set to jump 30 percent, from $115,345 to $150,000 -- an increase of $34,655, which is less than the $40,000 that White quoted. Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White, told us when we inquired that White overstated the size of the raise at his recent press conference and “should have said about $35,000.” White’s campaign pointed us to news articles indicating Perry wouldn’t take the raise. Robert Black, then a spokesman for the governor, was quoted in the June 2007 Morning News article saying Perry would not accept the pay raise when it kicked in that September, the start of the state’s fiscal year: “He hasn’t taken a pay raise and doesn’t think it’s necessary.” A Fort Worth Star Telegram news article published June 8, 2007, quoted Black as saying that “we asked them [lawmakers] to give the governor an opt-out provision, and they did that.” A clause in the 2008-09 budget titled “Governor’s Salary Authorization” says the governor can set his salary “at any amount below the listed authorization” — in this case, $150,000. Perry’s office confirmed that he has not exercised the opt-out provision since his raise became law. We didn’t find statements from Perry or his aides to the effect that instead of refusing the pay increase, the governor would donate it to charity. Yet Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger wrote us in an e-mail: “The governor did not seek a pay raise, but the Texas Legislature authorized an increase from $115,000 to $150,000 in 2007 and 2009. Since that time, he has only taken home about $115,000 each fiscal year and has donated the rest to charity.” Perry’s take-home state pay -- meaning wages subject to federal income taxes -- increased from $103,320 in 2006 to $111,361 in 2007 and $135,925 in 2008, according to his tax returns for those years, which he has made public. Bob Martin, a Houston accountant who studied Perry’s tax returns at the request of an Associated Press reporter, told us the amount of taxes that were withheld from Perry’s pay in 2008 indicated that his gross salary was $150,000. He speculated that the difference between Perry’s taxable wages and his gross salary could be explained by pre-tax deductions such as retirement contributions; such deductions would be on Perry’s W-2 form. We found no sign of Perry making his W-2s public. In an Aug. 27, 2009 article, the Morning News reported that in 2008, Perry took “the almost $30,000 raise provided to him by the Legislature” and spread it among the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, the March of Dimes and “a foundation that provides aid to families of fallen veterans.” Perry’s 2008 tax return shows gifts of $9,996 each to the March of Dimes, the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, and the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, where Perry’s wife, Anita, works. The governor filed an extension on his 2009 tax return, so details on more recent charitable donations and take-home pay are not yet available.  The White campaign says its examination of Perry’s available tax returns for the years he’s been governor found that Perry has not yet given the full amount of his pay increase to charity. The campaign did two different calculations: First, it compared the increase in Perry’s taxable state-paid income in 2007 and 2008 (about $40,000) with his total charitable gifts during the same time ($38,399). Second, it compared the increase in Perry’s gross state salary ($46,206) with the donations ($38,399). Cesinger later said the governor had “contributed an additional $8,668 in 2008 to the State Employee Charitable Campaign that was not claimed as a deduction on his tax return.” A gift of that amount would close the gap cited by the White campaign. All in all, does White land his three-part punch? He errs on the size of the raise.  While Perry didn’t personally tell the media he wouldn’t take the raise, a gubernatorial spokesman speaking on his behalf was quoted in newspaper articles as saying so. Perry’s spokeswoman told us he’s made charitable donations exceeding the additional dollars that came his way in the raise. But that’s not the same as not accepting the raise in the first place. Nor has Perry used the opt-out provision put into the law to allow him to do so. We rate White’s statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/27/bill-white/bill-white-says-perry-said-he-wouldnt-take-pay-rai/

"['Bipartisanship', 'Texas', 'Bryan Underwood']","
Underwood says Cuellar has voted with Pelosi 96 percent of last session
","
If the National Republican Congressional Committee is any guide, Republicans seeking to unseat Democrats in the U.S. House see promise in linking them to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who has shepherded much of the Obama administration’s legislation through the House. 
The committee didn’t feature Texas U.S. Rep Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, among 10 Pelosi ""puppets"" displayed on its website. But Bryan Underwood, the Republican running against Cuellar, recently called him a ""Pelosi pawn."" 
""Ninety-six percent of last session, he voted with Nancy Pelosi,"" Underwood said June 12 at the Republican Party of Texas convention.  
When we followed up with Underwood’s campaign, consultant John Pritchett pointed us to an online Washington Post database of lawmakers’ voting histories showing that Cuellar voted with Democrats 96 percent of the time in 2009-10. 
""She’s the leader of the party, she’s the speaker of the party, she is the party,"" Pritchett said.  
Fair enough? Well, we asked Pritchett about Underwood’s reference to ""last session"" in his convention remark. In the parlance of Washington, that would ordinarily mean the session before the current one, which began Jan. 5, 2010. However, Pritchett said that Underwood meant the entire period the current House membership — the 111th Congress — has been voting, from January 2009 through this month.  
Setting aside for a moment Cuellar’s votes in step with his party, we wondered how he’s personally aligned with Pelosi.  
A caveat: Any check of the vote-for-vote ratio between Cuellar and the speaker wouldn’t reflect Cuellar’s full voting history. That’s because Pelosi doesn’t vote that often. The House Speaker’s primary role is to preside over the 435-member House, generally voting only when it would make a difference in the legislation’s outcome. Sean Theriault, an associate professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin, put it like this: ""If not voting makes them look like they have the entire House’s interest at heart, all the better.""   
From early 2009 through May 28, 2010, Pelosi voted 71 times, while Cuellar voted 1,323 times, according to the database. And according to the database, Pelosi and Cuellar both voted 48 times from Jan. 6, 2009 to Dec. 24, 2009 with Cuellar voting with Republicans five times and lining up with Pelosi 43 times, compiling an 89.5-percent I’m-with-her rate. Six months into the 2010 session, Pelosi has voted 23 times, according to the database, with Cuellar voting like her all 23 times. Republicans voted with them thrice.  
When did Cuellar stray from Pelosi’s side in 2009? He voted for Rep. Bart Stupak’s amendment that put restrictions on abortions available in government-run health care plans. He voted for Rep. Walt Minnick’s amendment that would have scrapped certain consumer protections proposed in financial overhaul legislation. He voted for a bill to disapprove the obligation to purchase troubled assets under the stimulus act. And he voted against two appropriation bills; Cuellar is the only Texan in the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of fiscally-conservative Democrats. 
Colin Strother, a spokesman for Cuellar’s campaign, pointed out that the 96 percent that Underwood cites includes a raft of votes for minor items, such as a vote to congratulate the New Orleans Saints for winning the Super Bowl.  
Finally, we sought other measures of Cuellar’s vote history.  
One measure is how many times he’s voted in step with President Barack Obama when he’s clearly indicated his preferences — 92 percent of his votes deferred to Obama last session, according to Congressional Quarterly. Separately, the respected National Journal reviewed 97 key roll-call votes in 2009, ultimately classing Cuellar as a ""centrist."" Based on those selected votes, the Journal rated him the 215th most liberal member of the House, which also makes him the 216th most conservative. That hits the median position in the center exactly. 
Summing up: Underwood misspoke when he said ""last session"" in referring to votes that took place over the last House session (2009) as well as the current one (2010).  He also wasn’t as precise as he could have been if he intended delegates to think he was talking about Cuellar lock-stepping with fellow Democrats, rather than just Speaker Pelosi. 
Still, Cuellar tends to vote nearly all the time with her — and with his party. Cuellar voted nearly 90 percent of the time just like Pelosi last session and this session, he voted just like her on the 23 occasions they’ve both voted. Since January 2009, Cuellar has voted 96 percent of the time in alignment with most fellow Democrats. 
We rate Underwood’s statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/26/bryan-underwood/underwood-says-cuellar-has-voted-pelosi-96-percent/

Bill McCollum and his supposed Planned Parenthood problem
","Rick Scott's new campaign mailer is blasting his Republican primary opponent for governor, Bill McCollum, as being in the pocket of the pro-choice group Planned Parenthood.""Bill McCollum has accepted thousands from lobbyists for Planned Parenthood,"" says the outside of the mailer. The claim is printed over the top of an image of a faceless man wearing a Planned Parenthood button and taking a stack of money.The Planned Parenthood claim is repeated inside the mailer, which started appearing in mailboxes around June 23, 2010. The time, the line is next to a picture of McCollum and the Planned Parenthood logo and opposite is a picture of Rick Scott and a logo that reads ""100% pro-life.""We've already dipped into Scott's attacks against McCollum's pro-life resume, rating a claim that McCollum and President Barack Obama hold the same position on embryonic stem cell research Mostly True. In this item we wanted to fact-check McCollum's ties to Planned Parenthood, a connection that -- if true -- could be damaging in a GOP primary.The mail piece includes a footnote to substantiate Scott's claim, saying the lobbyist in question is the firm Arnold & Porter. The campaign then searched federal campaign finance databases to see Arnold & Porter's contributions to McCollum's previous federal campaigns.So we did the same thing.What we found is that if you tilt your head just so, stand on one leg and squint your eyes, Scott's claim might hold up. Maybe.Let us explain.The U.S. Senate keeps an excellent online lobbyist disclosure database that allows anyone to see who lobbyists are representing and how much they're being compensated.We searched to see who Planned Parenthood had retained as a federal lobbyist and indeed, Arnold & Porter is included. The Washington, D.C., firm is a full service law firm that also does legislative lobbying and public policy work. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the firm earned $4.45 million in 2009 lobbying on behalf of 28 different groups, including BP, the state of Oregon and Major League Baseball's Office of the Commissioner. Its biggest client in 2009 was Altria Group, the parent company of Philip Morris USA.According to the Senate lobbying database, Arnold & Porter was eligible to lobby for Planned Parenthood from 2000-2007. Arnold & Porter received $60,000 in 2000. The rest of the time, the firm received between $0 and $10,000 every six months for its work (federal rules don't require Arnold & Porter to break out amounts under $10,000). The U.S. House disclosure website lists Arnold & Porter as a lobbyist for Planned Parenthood in 2005, 2006 and 2007, receiving between $0 and $10,000 every six months. Arnold & Porter, the registered Planned Parenthood lobbyist, did contribute to McCollum -- a whopping $2,000 that we could identify. The firm's political action committee made two $1,000 contributions to McCollum's Congressional campaign account, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission. The contributions came in 1997 and 1998.For the record, Arnold & Porter's political action committee also has donated to Republicans like former Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft, current Florida U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, House Majority Leader John Boehner, and former President George W. Bush (and Sens. Lindsey Graham, Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch and John McCain) (and the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee) (and Sens. Mitch McConnell and Trent Lott) (and Elizabeth Dole and Dick Armey) (and Sen. Saxby Chambliss and Rep. Eric Cantor, too).Here's the first problem: Arnold & Porter wasn't registered as a Planned Parenthood lobbyist when it made those contributions to McCollum, records show.And here's another one: It's a gigantic leap to say those contributions had anything to do with Planned Parenthood. Using the same logic, you can stick Bush, Boehner, Ashcroft and all those other Republicans with the same label.And then there's this: When McCollum ran for the U.S. Senate in 2000, the National Right To Life Political Action Committee spent $114,835 on his behalf.Oh, this, too: In his last year in Congress, 1999, McCollum received a 0 percent rating from Planned Parenthood and a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee. (We should note that when McCollum ran for the U.S. Senate in 2004, the National Right to Life Committee endorsed Mel Martinez over McCollum, because McCollum said he supported an expansion of embryonic stem cell research. But that doesn't have anything to do with Scott's claim in this case).It appears to us that the Scott campaign is trying very hard to link McCollum and Planned Parenthood in an attempt to attack McCollum's pro-life credentials. They succeeded by finding a Washington law firm that at one point lobbied for Planned Parenthood and at another point gave $2,000 to McCollum.But there's no evidence -- scratch that. We don't think any logical person would conclude that Arnold & Porter's contributions to McCollum and its future business with Planned Parenthood have anything to do with the other.The Truth-O-Meter is hot under the collar about this one.

Greene attacks Meek for role in subprime market mess
","When the Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate debated June 22, 2010, in West Palm Beach, Jeff Greene didn’t go more than 60 seconds into his opening statement before launching his first attack on Rep. Kendrick Meek.""My opponent here has accepted money from Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, hosted subprime mortgage seminars and failed to regulate the banks, causing the worst housing crisis in our nation’s history and causing Florida to be at the forefront of these foreclosures.""Is Greene right about Meek getting money from these two government lenders and putting on seminars on how to get a subprime mortgage? Well, yes and no.Public records show Meek accepted campaign contributions in 2006 and 2008 from the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Political Action Committee, aka Freddie Mac PAC, and Federal National Mortgage Association Political Action Committee, aka Fannie Mae PAC (see here www.opensecrets.org). The Fannie Mae PAC, for example, contributed $2,000 to Meek’s campaign in 2006. The Freddie Mac PAC donated $1,000 in 2006 and 2008. In fact, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac PACs donated to many other candidates in those election years -- Republican and Democrat alike. Altogether, the Fannie Mae PAC shelled out more than $1.45 million in those two election cycles, and Freddie Mac handed out $542,000 more, according to OpenSecrets.org, a website affiliated with Center for Responsive Politics, a research group that tracks money in U.S. politics and elections. So what about the seminars? As the U.S. housing market peaked in mid-2006 and later collapsed -- the Miami-Dade Clerk of Courts registered 64,001 foreclosure filings in 2009, compared to 9,814 in 2006 -- Meek organized a handful of public forums that aimed to secure houses for first-time homeowners (see foreclosure statistics here www.miami-dadeclerk.com/property_mortgage_foreclosures.asp). According to a flier for one March 2007 conference, the event focused on how to steer aspiring buyers to homeownership. Other topics looked at how to repair credit, identify the right mortgage, and budget expenses. Eager to learn more about homeownership opportunities from representatives with different banks and mortgage companies, ""hundreds"" poured into Florida Memorial University’s Athletic Center in Miami Gardens on March 17, 2007, according to the Miami Times, a family-owned weekly newspaper that serves Miami-Dade’s African-American community. Dubbed the ""Ten Weeks to Homeownership Conference,"" the Meek event brought not only the Miami congressman but other elected officials, including Miami-Dade County Commissioner Barbara Jordan and then-Miami Gardens Vice Mayor Oscar Braynon II, a onetime Meek intern. Also lending their names to the event were the Rotary Club of Opa-locka and the Dade County Alumnae Chapter, Delta Sigma Sorority.The March 2007 event, typical of similar homeowner forums Meek has organized, was held in conjunction with W.O.W. (With Ownership Wealth), a group the Congressional Black Caucus formed in 2001 with the aim of increasing homeownership rates among minorities. On a website for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are listed among the group’s ""national sponsors."" Calling the sessions ""subprime mortgage seminars"" is a stretch, we think. The subprime market targeted prospective home owners who had poor credit ratings or limited credit histories. But the forums also covered the areas of credit counseling and financial literacy. Furthermore, these forums are a mainstay in Meek’s district, which is northern Miami-Dade and southern Broward. Well before the subprime market existed, Meek held fairs on homeownership and credit repair. So did his mother, Carrie Meek, during the decade she served in Congress. ""All the information you need to buy a home will be available to you at the fair, such as how to get the best financing, how to find a good house to buy, or if you just don't understand the home-buying process and don't want to get ripped off,"" Meek was quoted as saying in Miami Times.So while it’s true that Meek accepted money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, it’s not fair to call the forums ""subprime mortgage seminars."" The agenda wasn’t just homeownership. Moreover, these forums have long been the norm in Meek’s district -- regardless of what was happening in the housing market. So we rate Greene’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/25/jeff-greene/greene-attacks-meek-role-subprime-market-mess/
