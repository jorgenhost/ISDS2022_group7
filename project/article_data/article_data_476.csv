Does entering prostitution mean you have seven years to live?
","Under current safe harbor laws, a Missouri minor can use coercion as a defense for prostitution charges. A new bill proposed by state Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, R-Arnold, would take it a step further, giving all those who were under the age of 18 when convicted of prostitution a chance to expunge records of the offense. While introducing the bill at a General Laws Committee Hearing, Coleman used some alarming statistics. ""The average age that a girl enters, and it’s typically a girl, enters into prostitution is age 14,"" she said Jan. 23. ""She enters prostitution in the same way that most sex victims and sexual assault victims do, which is through a grooming process, often at the hands of a family member. Her life expectancy is seven years after entering into prostitution."" Sex work is a dangerous trade, especially for a person forced into it, but are they dying after seven years? We decided to find out. When we asked Coleman about her source for the statistic, she cited a 2011 FBI document. The document in question, which doesn’t cite a specific study, states, ""The average age of a new child prostitute is 13, and the life expectancy after becoming a child prostitute is 7 years."" But when PolitiFact reached out to the FBI for a 2015 fact check, an agency spokesman backtracked, saying in an email that ""it should not be considered a general statement of FBI findings."" There are not many studies on sex work or child prostitutes, but the studies that exist don’t support the the seven-year claim. In a long-term study of mortality in women sex workers in Colorado Springs, researchers tracked over 1,600 female sex workers from 1967 to 1999. Of these women, 100 died over the course of the 33-year study. COYOTE-RI, a sex work advocacy group in Rhode Island, surveyed around 1,500 U.S. sex workers in 2017. While the study has not yet been published, executive director Bella Robinson said in an interview that the average age of entry into prostitution was 22 and the average age of the respondents was 33 years old. Robinson said the seven-year life expectancy statistic is far-fetched — in part because she’s been in the industry for 35 years herself. Part of the problem with the seven-year claim comes with lumping sex work and sex trafficking together. Robinson explained that there are many different kinds of sex work, so it’s next to impossible to make any accurate generalizations. Melissa Torres, director of the Human Trafficking Research Portfolio at the Institute on Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault, said that the seven-year statistic is often cited in tandem with the average age of entry being 12 years old. These numbers are used and reused with abandon, but Torres said there’s just no way of knowing that information. ""There's way too many factors ... to know if (the claim is) true, but from what we do know, it's unfounded at the moment,"" Torres said. Coleman said a girl’s ""life expectancy is seven years after entering into prostitution."" There have been no large-scale studies done to prove this statistic. Some smaller studies, including COYOTE-RI’s, show sex workers living much longer than seven years. Coleman based this claim off an eight-year-old budget report. The FBI did not state a source for this number and has since denounced it. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFAB240>],/factchecks/2019/feb/27/mary-elizabeth-coleman/does-entering-prostitution-mean-you-have-seven-yea/

Does West Virginia have the nation's lowest workforce participation rate?
","Is workforce participation lower in West Virginia than in any state? That’s what West Virginia University president Gordon Gee wrote in a recent op-ed. Gee’s Jan. 14 column in the State Journal newspaper was titled, ""An effective education system is key to West Virginia’s future."" In the column, Gee wrote, ""As I often point out, our state does not have a job problem. It has a skills problem that leaves many high-paying jobs unfilled. We have the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate, which hovers around 50 percent, when the national average is about 63 percent."" Is this claim accurate? We took a closer look. Economists say the most appropriate statistic in this case is the civilian labor force participation rate, which is calculated on a regular basis by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The statistic takes the number of people who are employed, adds it to the number of unemployed people who are looking for work, and divides the sum by the total population that is at least 16 years of age, not serving on active duty in the military, and not institutionalized in a facility such as a prison or a long-term-care home. The most recent data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from December 2018, showed that West Virginia had a civilian labor force participation rate of 53.9 percent. The figure didn’t deviate much throughout 2018, ranging from 53.7 percent to 54 percent depending on the month. The past five years also looked similar to 2018. The average workforce participation rate in 2018 was 53.9 percent. In 2017 it was 53.3 percent, in 2016 it was 53.1 percent, in 2015 it was 52.8 percent, and in 2014 it was 53.1 percent. He would have been a little closer using a similar, but distinct, statistic known as the employment-population ratio. This statistic takes the number of employed people and divides it by the same overall population used in the civilian labor force participation rate. In West Virginia, that was 51.2 percent in December 2018, and was close to that during 2018. So for this part of his statement, Gee was close, and he did say ""around 50 percent,"" which gives him some wiggle room. West Virginia did indeed have the lowest civilian labor force participation rate in the nation in December 2018. The next-closest state was Mississippi, with 55.8 percent. And the pattern was much the same for the rest of 2018. In fact, West Virginia has ""remained in the lowest spot since the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics began reporting the series on a consistent basis in 1976,"" said Brian Lego, research assistant professor at West Virginia University’s Bureau of Business and Economic Research. The national civilian labor force participation rate was 63.1 percent in December 2018, after rising from a low of 62.7 percent earlier in the year. So Gee is on target with his statement that the national rate was ""about 63 percent."" Lego said there are a range of factors that explain the state’s weak performance. ""The big picture reasons are related to human capital deficiencies such as lack of skills needed for jobs available,"" he said. He also cited poor health, drug abuse, and a large number of elderly residents in West Virginia. Gee said, ""We have the nation’s lowest workforce participation rate, which hovers around 50 percent, when the national average is about 63 percent."" He was very close on all three elements of the statement, and he gave himself some breathing room by using the words ""around"" and ""about."" We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAC0DC0>],/factchecks/2019/feb/27/e-gordon-gee/does-west-virginia-have-nations-lowest-workforce-p/

No, state laws don't criminalize just any criticism
","The American Civil Liberties Union told its followers on social media that criticizing people can not only get them into lawsuits, but even get them arrested in some states. ""Half the states in the U.S. have laws that criminalize criticism,"" the ACLU claimed in a Facebook post. An accompanying graphic showed the map of ""States Where Criticizing People Can Get You Arrested"". The Facebook post was shared more than 1,300 times with many comments asking for more context or explanation. Some questioned if the term ""criticism"" was being conflated with ""defamation."" Our readers flagged this claim and asked us for a fact-check. We asked First Amendment lawyers and experts who said the claim is overly broad. In a web article, the ACLU backed up its post by stating that 24 states have laws ""that make it a crime to publicly say mean things about people."" An interactive map links to different states’ criminal defamation provisions in state law. ""These laws violate the First Amendment and are disproportionately used against people who criticize public officials or government employees,"" the ACLU said. Abdullah Hasan, a communications officer at the ACLU told PolitiFact that the Facebook post was part of the social media campaign launched in December 2018, after the organization filed a lawsuit on behalf of Robert Frese to challenge the criminal defamation law in New Hampshire. Frese, an Exeter resident, was arrested by the Exeter Police Department for commenting on a news article that the police chief ""covered up for this dirty cop."" The ACLU post was to raise awareness about criminal defamation laws, which gives public officials the option to interpret defamation and arrest people because of criticism, the ACLU said. The group’s position is that defamation cases should be handled in civil court only and not be subject to criminal penalties. Anti-defamation provisions have been around as early as the period before the American Revolution, with roots from British common law and the oppression of sedition under the colonial rule. In many states, defamation was viewed as ""breach of the peace"" when the criminal provisions were first conceived. The 24 states highlighted by the ACLU do have criminal libel statutes, constitution and codes on the books, though many have restrictions on these provisions. The problem with the post is that the ACLU is calling these statutes ""criticism,"" when in most cases the statements have to be a factual assertion, defamatory and false to be subject to prosecution. Jessica Goldman, a First Amendment lawyer and partner at Summit Law Group in Seattle, Washington, said that ""criminalize criticism"" is an overbroad way to put it. For instance, in Illinois, someone could be prosecuted for libel only if they publish false and derogatory statements about banks’ financial condition. North Carolina prohibits people (including reporters and editors) from running false statements in newspapers or periodicals to defame others and corporations. In Kentucky, the statute only states that the court may bring criminal action for libel or slander when court judges are concerned. Lucian T. Pera, a First Amendment expert and partner at Adams and Reese, LLC, told PolitiFact that states ""don’t criminalize any criticism, under any circumstance, and each law typically requires proof of more than mere criticism. There’s usually a level of falsity required, and usually some element of intent."" In almost every state that the ACLU claimed to have criminal libel or slander law, truth is a defense to libel. This provision grants immunity to the disseminator of defamation if the statement is true. In addition, in many states, defamatory remarks are also justified when the communication is privileged, such as in legal proceedings. Finally, opinions that don’t include factual assertions have First Amendment protection. Still, some state laws that are unconstitutional remain on the books. The Supreme Court, for example, ruled in Garrison vs. Louisiana in 1964 that Louisiana’s criminal libel statute was unconstitutional for failing to establish a standard demonstrating actual malice. (The actual malice standard for civil libel was established in Sullivan vs. New York Times that same year.) Even after the ruling, the Louisiana criminal defamation law remains on the books, and the ACLU counted it as part of the graphic. Prosecutions do happen, however. Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California - Los Angeles, collected data on criminal defamation prosecutions and wrote that they happened about 10 to 20 times a year and often lead to conviction. But that doesn’t mean those convictions are invalid. Volokh told PolitiFact that more recent statutes are ""likely constitutional precisely because they ban knowingly false factual assertions that injure someone’s reputation — libel — and not just 'criticism.' "" The ACLU said that ""half the states in the U.S. have laws that criminalize criticism."" While almost half of the states do have criminal defamation provisions, to say that these laws criminalize criticism is an overstatement. It fails to represent that the goal of such laws is to criminalize only criticism with actual malice and untruth to hurt others’ reputation. Truthful criticism or opinion would not be subject to prosecution. Even some false statements would be defensible as long as they weren’t made with ill will or reckless disregard. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB931800>],/factchecks/2019/feb/27/american-civil-liberties-union/no-state-laws-dont-criminalize-just-any-criticism/

Fact-checking Tulsi Gabbard on farmers' bankruptcies, median income
","Farmers are declaring bankruptcy in ""record numbers"" and President Donald Trump is to blame, claimed Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. The congresswoman from Hawaii is running for president in the 2020 election. ""Trump’s volatile & ill-conceived trade wars are causing farmers to declare bankruptcy in record numbers,"" Gabbard tweeted Feb. 19. ""The median income for U.S. farm households was -$1,548 in 2018. This is crazy. We need leadership in the WH that provides the stability & support small farmers need to thrive."" Trump’s volatile & ill-conceived trade wars are causing farmers to declare bankruptcy in record numbers. The median income for U.S. farm households was -$1,548 in 2018. This is crazy. We need leadership in the WH that provides the stability & support small farmers need to thrive. Is it true that farmers are declaring bankruptcy in record numbers? Historical data does not prove her claim. What about median income for farmers? Gabbard’s tweet gives an incomplete picture. Experts said it's too early to gauge whether the administration's trade policies — regardless of how they are characterized — are a factor in bankruptcies. Historical bankruptcy data does not support Gabbard’s claim of ""record"" declarations among farmers. The are several types of bankruptcy proceedings that people and corporations can file when they are having financial difficulties or are unable to repay debt. The filing or ""chapter"" of the bankruptcy law that most directly apply to farmers is Chapter 12, created after a farm financial crisis in the 1980s. Chapter 12 lets family farmers and family fishermen reorganize their debt and keep operating. Farmers must meet certain criteria to qualify for Chapter 12, including a debt cap that is currently about $4.15 million. (The debt limit is updated every three years to adjust for inflation.) Bankruptcy court data shows how many Chapter 12 filings there were over a given period of time. The data is not broken down by how many filings are from fishermen and how many are from farmers. But experts told us it’s safe to infer most are farmers. No matter what time period we looked at, Chapter 12 filings are not at record levels. In fiscal year 2018, there were 468 Chapter 12 filings. That’s lower than the number in fiscal year 2017, when there were 508 Chapter 12 filings. Looking back further, there were 707 filings in fiscal year 2010. Chapter 12 filings in calendar year 2018 (498) were slightly lower than they were in 2017 (501), and lower than several other recent calendar years. In calendar year 2010, there were 723 Chapter 12 filings. Chapter 12 filings for the 12-month period ending in June 2018 were also lower than in the same period in 2017. Researchers at the Ohio State University told PolitiFact that farmers and fishermen, especially those who exceed the Chapter 12 debt limit, can also file for Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcies.  So, Chapter 12 bankruptcies are only a subset of all bankruptcy cases filed by farmers. But even then, Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings in 2018 were not the highest on record. (It’s unclear how many of those were from farmers.) The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in November 2018 said that Chapter 12 bankruptcies were on the rise in the Ninth District. The Federal Reserve Bank’s analysis covered filings from Montana, South and North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin. ""Over the 12 months ending in June 2018, 84 farm operations in Ninth District states had filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy protection — more than twice the level seen in June 2014,"" the bank said. It’s unclear if Gabbard’s claim is based on the November report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis — her team did not respond to our repeated queries. But there isn’t one region in the United States that reflects the ""national"" agricultural production, because different types of crops, farming/ranching, specializations happen throughout the United States, said via email Ani Katchova, an associate professor in the department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics at Ohio State University, and Robert Dinterman, a post-doctoral researcher with the Farm Income Enhancement Program at Ohio State University. Overall, bankruptcies are not at a record high and the numbers don’t support stories of some major crisis, said Ed Flynn, a consultant with the American Bankruptcy Institute. Gabbard’s tweet said Trump’s ""volatile & ill-conceived trade wars"" were causing farmers to declare bankruptcy in record numbers. But a policy — regardless of how it’s characterized — generally won’t lead to a bankruptcy in the near term, and bankruptcy numbers alone aren’t enough to indicate that a policy was the driver, experts said. ""Somebody could look at the same data and spin it to say that the bankruptcy rate is just a fraction of what it was 20, 30 years ago,"" Flynn said. Gabbard tweeted that ""the median income for U.S. farm households was -$1,548 in 2018."" That phrasing doesn’t tell the whole picture. Farmers’ income typically comes from farm and off-farm sources, so the financial well-being of farming households is determined by both incomes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Median farm income for 2018 was forecast to be -$1,548 — that’s a decline from the -$800 median farm income in 2017 (numbers in nominal terms, not adjusted). But 2018’s negative numbers aren’t entirely unusual. ""In recent years, slightly more than half of farm households have had negative farm income each year,"" the USDA said. Still, many households rely on off-farm income (such as education, construction, and health care sectors) and that median income actually increased from $67,500 in 2017 to $69,418 in 2018. Accounting for off-farm and farm income, median farm household income was forecast to reach $76,594 in 2018, the USDA said in November 2018. Without mentioning off-farm income in her tweet, Gabbard gives the misleading impression that farmers’ overall median income was negative in 2018. Households that have most of their income come from off-farm jobs are not as affected by changes in farming costs and returns as are large commercial farms, but they may be more susceptible to changes in the broader economy, the USDA said. Negative farm earnings can also reduce the income taxes paid on off-farm sources of income, according to the USDA. The fact that a farm has a net loss doesn’t mean that the farm doesn’t contribute to a household’s well-being, said an August 2018 USDA report. ""A farmer may experience a net farm loss in most years, but still be economically rational in continuing to farm when total economic returns are considered,"" the report said. ""For example, a farmer may have negative net farm income but anticipate substantial capital gains in the long run and use farm losses in the short run as a tax write-off to increase the return from other sources of income."" Gabbard said farmers are declaring bankruptcy ""in record numbers"" and ""the median income for U.S. farm households was -$1,548 in 2018."" Bankruptcy filings are not at record levels. Chapter 12 filings in 2018 were lower than in 2017 and in other recent years. And Gabbard’s phrasing for median income for farm households is misleading. The median farm income was forecast at -$1,548 in 2018. But that’s not representative of a farmer’s overall median income. Farm household income includes off-farm and farm incomes. The median farm household income (off-farm and farm) for 2018 was forecast to reach $76,594 in 2018. Gabbard’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

No, undocumented immigrants don't get Medicare for free
","A recent Facebook post laments that senior citizens have to pay for federal health care benefits while undocumented immigrants enjoy the insurance gratis. ""Why do seniors on Social Security have to pay for Medicare and a supplemental (insurance) and the illegals get it all for free?"" asks a post published on the Columbian Post’s Facebook page on Jan. 31. The post, which had been shared more than 14,000 times by Feb. 26, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, we wondered: What is the Columbian Post? According to its Facebook account, the Columbian Post is ""an American Exceptionalism themed news media page"" that aims to ""promote and honor American heritage and the constitutional rights of our readers and fans."" The page also includes this disclaimer: ""We’re a growing paper. We don’t report fake news. We share OPINIONS, and News UPDATES. When we make mistakes we correct them. Please refrain from making snap judgements which are not true at all."" We wanted to ask the Post for more information about its claim that undocumented immigrants get Medicare for free but it wasn’t possible to send a message to the account on Facebook and there’s no contact information on its website. So we started researching the statement. Who is eligible for Medicare? The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services did not directly respond to PolitiFact’s query about whether the Facebook post’s claim is accurate. Instead, a spokesman for the agency said that individuals who want to apply for Medicare Part A and Part B must contact Social Security, which determines that person’s eligibility on behalf of Medicare. According to the Social Security Administration’s requirements for entitlement, they must be 65 years old, a U.S. resident and either a citizen or a lawful permanent resident who has lived in the country continuously for the five years immediately preceding the month all other requirements are met. Steven Wallace, a community health sciences professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told PolitiFact in an email that undocumented immigrants aren’t eligible for either Medicare or Social Security. ""You have pay into those systems for 10 years to be eligible and need a valid social security number to do so,"" Wallace wrote. ""When undocumented immigrants work with a SS number, it is either fake or someone else’s. So they pay into the system but are unable to claim benefits."" Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, also said the Facebook post’s claims were false. ""Social Security and Medicare benefits cannot be paid to people who are not lawfully present in the United States, among other requirements,"" he said in an email. ""Even lawfully present immigrants have to (be) residents for at least five years to qualify for Medicare benefits."" He directed us to two government documents. The first, the Program Operations Manual System for Social Security, notes that people in the country illegally are not eligible for benefits.   The second document, a publication from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, covers enrolling in Medicare, health insurance for people who are 65 and older, younger than 65 with certain disabilities, or people of any age with end-stage renal disease. Who pays for Medicare and who doesn’t?  Medicare has different parts. Part  A is hospital insurance that covers inpatient care at hospitals, hospice care and home health care. Generally, people are eligible if they’re 65 or older and meet citizenship and residency requirements; get disability benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board for at least 25 months; get disability benefits because they have ALS; have end-stage renal disease and meet certain requirements. Part B is medical insurance that helps cover doctor appointments, among other care. An immigrant ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence who has lived in the U.S. without a break for the 5-year period immediately before the month (they) file for enrollment in Part B"" is eligible for that insurance. Most people do not have to pay a premium for Part A, according to CMS, but everyone must pay for Part B if they want it. But Alan Taylor Kelley, a doctor and clinical lecturer at the University of Michigan, told PolitiFact that ""undocumented immigrants do not have access to any standard Medicare or Medicaid insurance programs offered by the federal government."" While undocumented immigrants can get ""emergency"" Medicaid covering ""very limited urgent/emergent services only,"" he said, there is no available Medicare program. ""In fact,"" he said, ""many pay into Medicare through taxes but don’t collect the benefit, thereby subsidizing the Medicare Trust Fund."" The fund finances Medicare health services through payroll taxes, general tax revenue and premiums enrollees pay, according to the Tax Policy Center. Taylor pointed to a January 2016 article in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found that though ""unauthorized immigrants seldom have access to public health insurance programs such as Medicare Part A,"" they have ""prolonged the life of the Medicare Trust Fund."" Sometimes the system is misused There has been news coverage about undocumented immigrants benefiting from Medicare, but they shouldn’t have. The Obama administration in 2014 announced plans to remove undocumented immigrants from Medicare rolls. Though officials then said immigrants are generally ineligible to receive federal benefits if they’re in the United States illegally, the New York Times reported, ""many illegal immigrants have received benefits because the Medicare agency did not update its rules or policies to carry out the restrictions imposed by Congress."" The inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services said that Medicare had improperly paid tens of millions of dollars a year to hospitals, doctors, nursing homes and pharmacies that had provided services to illegal immigrants, according to the Times. In 2018, the Justice Department prosecuted an undocumented immigrant who was convicted of using another man’s identity to apply for and receive Social Security disability benefits and Medicare benefits. He was sentenced to 13 months in prison and ordered to pay the approximate $423,000 he stole in restitution. Looking elsewhere, we found an Oct. 19, 2017, post on the National Conference of State Legislatures that describes confusion over who is eligible for what as health care reform and immigration reform debates intersect. But, the post says, unauthorized immigrants aren’t eligible for federal health insurance programs. They’re ""only eligible for more discrete programs like emergency medical assistance under Medicaid, services in federally qualified health centers and certain health programs."" Our ruling The Facebook post claims that legal residents must pay for Medicare while undocumented immigrants get the federal health insurance for free. As far as payment for Medicare goes, some people do have to pay a premium for Part A, according to CMS, but most don’t. And everyone must pay for Part B if they want it. But the meat of this statement is about immigrants and the suggestion that they’re milking Medicare benefits that law-abiding citizens don't get. While there have been reported cases of some undocumented immigrants having improperly received benefits, undocumented immigrants aren’t eligible for Medicare. We rate this Facebook post as False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACA0180>],/factchecks/2019/feb/27/facebook-posts/no-undocumented-immigrants-dont-get-medicare-free/

Polls show people in Texas are divided on the border wall
","Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro said at a news conference on Monday that most people in Texas are opposed to constructing a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. ""Our country, since its founding, has become the most prosperous and powerful nation on earth without any wall,"" said Castro, who represents San Antonio. ""That’s why I believe most of the American people and most people in my home state of Texas disagree with the president building a wall across our border."" Castro offered this claim about Texans while discussing legislation he sponsored, approved by the House on Tuesday, that would block President Donald Trump’s emergency order aimed at securing funding for his border wall. It’s no surprise that the Democratic-controlled House opposes Trump’s plan to build a wall, but is Castro right? Do Texans also oppose a wall? Polls show Texans divided on the wall Castro spokeswoman Jamie Geller said the congressman’s claim was based on an April 2018 poll published by Quinnipiac University which reported that 53 percent of respondents surveyed opposed construction of a wall, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. We decided to take a step back and consider polls released on this subject since 2016 from three non-partisan entities that run surveys in Texas to assess the validity of Castro’s claim: University of Texas/Texas Tribune polls, Texas Lyceum polls and Quinnipiac University polls. Four polls showed more respondents opposing the wall than supporting it, with one poll showing the opposite. A sixth survey released Tuesday, after Castro made his claim on Texans opposing the wall, revealed an even split. Only two of the polls showed a clear majority in opposition to the wall. A University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll of registered voters in Texas published in June 2016 showed that 52 percent of respondents either strongly supported or somewhat supported a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The same poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.83 percentage points, found 40 percent of respondents said they either strongly opposed or somewhat opposed a border wall. Of those polled, 8 percent said they did not know or had no opinion on the wall. Two years later, in February 2018, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll showed that 50 percent of respondents said they either strongly opposed or somewhat opposed a border wall and 45 percent strongly supported or somewhat supported a wall. Two polls from Texas Lyceum, a non-profit organization, showed majorities opposing the wall. These polls did not limit the pool of respondents to likely or registered voters and instead surveyed adults in Texas. A September 2016 poll from the group showed that 59 percent of adults polled opposed Trump’s proposed border wall, with 35 percent supporting the wall. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. An April 2017 Texas Lyceum poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, reported 61 percent of respondents opposing the wall and 35 percent expressing support. One year later, in April 2018, Quinnipiac University released a poll of Texas voters that showed 53 percent of respondents opposed building a wall along the border and 43 percent supported it. The poll surveyed 1,029 voters and the margin of error of 3.6 percentage points raised the possibility that fewer than 50 percent of Texas voters actually opposed the wall. Geller, Castro’s spokeswoman, pointed to this April 2018 poll as the evidence behind the Democrat’s claim. On Tuesday, Quinnipiac University released a new poll that shows Texas voters are evenly split on whether they support a border wall. Of the 1,222 voters surveyed, 48 percent said they supported a wall and 48 percent said they opposed one. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said the results show that Castro’s claim is not entirely true, at least as of Tuesday afternoon. ""It’s factually wrong,"" he said. ""It’s 48-48."" But do Texas voters support the way Trump is pursuing construction of the wall? The same Quinnipiac University Poll showed that 60 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Trump’s move to use emergency powers to secure the funding needed to construct a wall. Our ruling Castro said ""most people in my home state of Texas disagree with the president building a wall across our border."" Polls from the University of Texas/Texas Tribune, Texas Lyceum and Quinnipiac University showed that Texas voters and adults are largely divided on their support for a wall. Only two of the polls showed a clear majority in opposition to the wall – those conducted by Texas Lyceum in 2016 and 2017. In these two polls, the survey questioned adults in Texas and was not limited to likely or registered voters, unlike the University of Texas/Texas Tribune and Quinnipiac University polls. Castro’s comment was not limited to registered or likely voters, so we kept that in mind while determining a ruling. We rate this claim as Half True. Recent polls show more Texans opposing a border wall than supporting it, but only two of the six polls we considered showed a clear majority. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8FFA00>],/factchecks/2019/feb/26/joaquin-castro/polls-show-people-texas-are-divided-border-wall/

NC Democrat falsely ties school construction to teacher wages
","North Carolina needs new school buildings, but leaders disagree on how to pay for them. In December, Republican House Speaker Tim Moore announced his support for putting a $1.9 billion school bond on the ballot in 2020. In January, Senate Republicans introduced a pay-as-you-go plan that uses tax revenues — avoiding borrowing and avoiding the ballot. In response, Democrats argued that the Senate plan uses money that could go toward other priorities. On Feb. 20, Democratic state Sen. Wiley Nickel took it a step further. ""SB5 pays for school construction with teacher pay raises,"" the Cary senator tweeted, referring to the bill number. In the same tweet, Nickel then walks back his claim, suggesting teacher pay isn’t immediately affected: ""This plan puts into jeopardy funding for teacher pay raises, classroom supplies, broadband, roads and training for corrections officers."" His tweet then concludes with an image of the words, ""NC teachers shouldn’t have to pay the price for school construction."" Politicians often try to extrapolate negative consequences from legislation they oppose – even if those consequences are unlikely or uncertain. Nickel’s tweet is a prime example of a claim that should raise eyebrows. It suggests elected officials would take money away from teachers (who vote) and put it toward buildings (which don’t vote). PolitiFact looked at the bill in question, SB 5, to answer the question: Does it take money earmarked for teacher salaries and put it toward capital projects? No. We found no evidence that the bill affects teacher salaries or potential raises. A SPECIAL FUND The bill calls for using money from the State Capital Infrastructure Fund, a new fund created in 2017 that’s expected to receive 4 percent of tax revenues this year. ""Senate Republicans propose increasing the contribution to the fund to 4.5 percent of tax revenue, and letting K-12 schools use some of the money for school construction,"" The News & Observer reported. PolitiFact asked the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction whether the bill immediately affects teacher salaries. ""We have looked at the bill and the answer to your first question is no. The bill does not use money allocated for educator compensation,"" said Drew Elliot, communications director for NC DPI. PolitiFact also asked DPI if the bill could affect teacher salaries in the future. That’s ""difficult to answer without knowing the larger context of a full budget bill,"" Elliot said. HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS Contacted by PolitiFact, Nickel acknowledged that there’s no mention of teacher salaries in the school construction proposal. He said it drains money from the state’s general fund, leaving the state with less money for other projects. As Nickel sees it, the Senate GOP plan leaves the state with one of three options in crafting a budget: • No teacher pay raises • Increase in sales taxes and fees to cover the difference • ""More budget cuts to departments that have already endured massive cuts to staff and services under their spending plan."" Nickel isn’t the only one who says he’s worried about the plan affecting future spending. Joe Coletti, senior fellow at the John Locke Foundation, a conservative think tank, told the Carolina Journal that the legislature may choose to use other funds if tax revenues ever decrease. However, those predictions and concerns are over hypotheticals. They don’t reflect the immediate impact of the Senate’s plan for funding school construction. POLITIFACT RULING Nickel said SB 5 ""pays for school construction with teacher pay raises."" This is a rhetorical point that could be taken literally. It’s possible the bill would leave less money for teacher pay raises and other budget priorities. But the bill itself doesn’t directly take money from teacher salaries or divert money away from them. We rate this False. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

"['Infrastructure', 'Public Safety', 'Transportation', 'Wisconsin', 'Craig Thompson']","
Is Thompson correct that Wisconsin has the biggest highway headache in the Midwest?
","Between orange construction barrels every summer and icy conditions every winter, highway driving can be an adventure. But is it true that Wisconsin drivers have the biggest highway headache in the Midwest? Craig Thompson, who has been nominated by Gov. Tony Evers to lead the state Department of Transportation, thinks so: On Feb. 20, 2019, Thompson testified before the state Senate's transportation committee and said that ""by every measure the condition"" of Wisconsin's transportation system ""is declining,"" according to a report from the Associated Press. How bad is it? Citing a Legislative Audit Bureau report, Thompson said that among neighboring states, the condition of Wisconsin highways was rated ""not only the worst, but it was worse by a gaping margin."" Is he right? Some background Let’s take a quick detour into road funding issues. Thompson led the Wisconsin Transportation Development Association, an organization that represents road builders and local governments, among other groups. He has long been an advocate for more revenue for transportation projects. The organization was behind the ""Just Fix It"" campaign, which during the 2018 election pushed for more spending on roads. The effort was perceived by some as an effort against Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Thompson has said raising the state's gas tax or increasing license plate registration fees would be necessary to find a long-term solution for road projects. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, has said Thompson's road-builder ties bother some members of his caucus who think the DOT is spending too much already.  Thompson told senators the budget will prioritize fixing current roads and infrastructure before tackling new projects. ""We still need an additional $360 to $400 million a biennium in order to just maintain the current level of condition that we have on our state highway system,"" Thompson said at the Senate hearing, according to a Wisconsin Public Radio report. ""That doesn't begin to mention the rebuilding of the interstate system that still needs to occur or aids for the local units of government."" The evidence When asked to provide backup for Thompson’s statement, the secretary-designee’s office pointed to a January 2017 Legislative Audit Bureau report. The report detailed the condition of the Midwestern state highways as measured by the International Roughness Index. The IRI is a pavement condition measurement required by the Federal Highway Administration. It is the only measure used by all states, thus it is the only way to make an apples-to-apples comparison of pavement condition, Thompson’s office said. In 2009, the state transportation department began using the index, which was developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The index is used by the department to help determine future highway projects and necessary maintenance work. The most recent IRI information available at the time of the Legislative Audit Bureau audit was for 2014. The report shows only 32.2 percent of Wisconsin’s highways were classified in good condition. Here is how other neighboring states compare: *Michigan 73.8 percent *Illinois 66.1 percent *Minnesota 64.6 percent *Iowa 55.3 percent Indeed, other Midwestern states were also far above Wisconsin. Indiana and Ohio, for instance,  both had at least 75 percent of their roads rated in good condition. In the United States overall, 63.4 percent of highways were classified in good condition. While the report is the most recent available, it’s worth noting that it is based on 2014 information and the picture may have changed since then in other states.
  A national report Another measure provides some perspective on how roads rate within the state. In a Sept. 18, 2018 article, the The Cap Times noted that another report, ""Wisconsin Transportation by the Numbers,""  found that 55 percent of Wisconsin's major locally- and state-maintained roads have pavement that is in poor condition and 19 percent in mediocre condition. The report was compiled by TRIP, a national nonprofit transportation research group, using 2016 data the state Department of Transportation provides annually to the Federal Highway Administration in its analysis of road and pavement conditions. The report said Milwaukee fares the worst, with poorly rated pavement on 54 percent of the city's major roads. In Madison, 49 percent of roads have pavement in poor condition. TRIP estimated a Milwaukee driver spends $944 on vehicle repair and maintenance because of road quality, while a Madison driver spends about $910. Our rating Thompson said among neighboring states, the condition of Wisconsin highways was rated ""not only the worst, but it was worse by a gaping margin."" A Legislative Audit Bureau report found only 32.2 percent of Wisconsin’s highways classified in good condition, far below those of neighboring states Michigan, Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota. Those states all had at least 55 percent of highways in good condition. So, the claim is accurate -- though the data is, well dated. Our definition of Mostly True is the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, and that puts Thompson in the driver's seat with his claim.   ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE395C0>],/factchecks/2019/feb/26/craig-thompson/thompson-correct-wisconsin-has-the-biggest-hig/

No, Hillary Clinton didn't advocate for reducing human populations
","Plenty of people have worried that the world’s growing population will over-tax the earth’s resources, but Hillary Clinton didn't advocate for reducing the number of humans here ASAP.

In a June 24, 2011, post about Al Gore and population control, Infowars describes Pianka as a ""very prominent advocate of radical human population control"" and credits Pianka as its source for the quote.

No, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was not photographed holding her legs open
","U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has quickly become the subject of fake news. In January, a photo of feet emerging from a bathtub was wrongly described as a nude selfie of the Democratic congresswoman from New York. Bloggers have attributed false quotes to her in an apparent attempt to make her look dumb. Now what appears to be a photoshopped image is being used to discredit Ocasio-Cortez. The picture, which was published on Facebook on Feb. 15, shows a man holding up a woman by her arms while she holds her legs open in the air. The woman appears to be Ocasio-Cortez, laughing.  While there are many pictures online of her laughing, this one strongly resembles this photo that was taken after she won the Democratic Primary in June. We couldn’t find any credible sources for the photo, or news coverage corroborating that it’s Ocasio-Cortez, a regular figure in media reports. It closely resembles a photo, featuring a different woman with the same man holding her up, that was shared several years ago. The post, published by the account Texas Supporters For President Donald J Trump, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Ocasio-Cortez’s office did not respond to an email from PolitiFact about the authenticity of the photo. Let’s look closely at the image.

Does the U.S. have record bankruptcies in farm country?
","President Donald Trump’s re-election prospects for 2020 may depend on how well the economy is performing a year from now. A former Democratic senator from North Dakota says warning signs from farm country don’t bode well for him. On ABC’s This Week, Heidi Heitkamp said the economy is starting to show weak spots. ""One of the leading indicators in the economy is agriculture,"" she said. ""We have record bankruptcies in farming country."" Are there really ""record bankruptcies in farming country""? We found that the farm bankruptcy rate is exceeding historical norms in the upper Midwest, which includes Heitkamp’s home state of North Dakota. But experts told us the term ""farming country"" has no official definition, making the national picture the most relevant measurement. And nationally, the farm bankruptcy rate has been fairly steady, and in fact sits well below the highs of just a few years ago. Farmers can actually file under four possible chapters of the bankruptcy code, said Robert Dinterman, a researcher with Ohio State University’s Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics. They are chapters 7, 11, 12, and 13. Each variety of bankruptcy has its own parameters and requirements (here’s a breakdown from the trade publication AgWeek), but the chapter most commonly used to keep track of farm bankruptcies is chapter 12. That’s because it’s the only one that is exclusively reserved for farmers and fishermen. Court data does not distinguish between farm filings and non-farm filings under the other chapters, so it’s far more difficult to track the number of farm-specific bankruptcies under those chapters. Chapter 12 bankruptcy was created in 1986 as a response to the worst farm crisis since the Great Depression, which had been caused by a mix of factors, including low commodity prices, high debt levels, high inflation, high gas prices, and a grain embargo against the Soviet Union. Heitkamp’s office pointed us to a Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis report from Nov. 14, 2018, and a Wall Street Journal article from Feb. 6, 2019. The Fed report found that over the 12 months ending in June 2018, the states comprising most of the bank’s region -- Minnesota, Montana, North and South Dakota plus parts of Wisconsin -- accounted for 84 farm bankruptcies under chapter 12, more than twice the level seen in June 2014 and a high going back to at least 2007. Here’s a chart from the report:  The Wall Street Journal article, meanwhile, found that bankruptcies in three judicial districts had hit 10-year highs -- the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals (Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin), the Eighth Circuit (North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, and Arkansas), and the Tenth Circuit (Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, and Oklahoma). Those circuits accounted for nearly half of all U.S. farm sales, the Journal reported. Here’s the problem: The region stretching from North Dakota to Oklahoma, and from Utah to Indiana, may be facing higher levels of farm bankruptcies than at any point in the past decade or so. But these states are still just a portion of U.S. ""farming country"" -- for instance, two of the top three states in cash receipts for all commodities in 2017 were California and Texas, both of which are outside the region highlighted by these reports. And the farm bankruptcy picture is different if you look at the nation as a whole. Court data compiled by the American Farm Bureau Federation, a trade group, found that chapter 12 filings nationwide actually fell by about 1 percent in 2018, and that the 2018 level was below the 10-year average. ""Bankruptcies are not at record levels,"" John Newton, the Farm Bureau’s chief economist, told PolitiFact. Longer-term statistics concur. Court data compiled by Dinterman and Ani Katchova of Ohio State found that chapter 12 filings were higher for several years after the Great Recession than they are now, and were higher still around 2003.  An even longer-term look published by Dinterman and Katchova shows that the bankruptcy rate was vastly higher during the 1980s farm crisis, although that peak is not directly comparable because it occurred before the advent of chapter 12. (In fact, the high rates of that era were the reason the law was passed in the first place.)  Despite the regional variations, the national farm bankruptcy rate is generally ""stable,"" Dinterman told PolitiFact. ""Nationally, we saw higher farm bankruptcies in the 2009 to 2012 period,"" he said. There are other problems facing farmers beyond the bankruptcy numbers, according to the Farm Bureau, including heavier-than-normal debt loads. And Heitkamp’s office cited projections of declining farm profits made by the Agriculture Department in November 2018, which would put profits near their lowest level since 2002. So there are certainly warning signs for farm country. But Heitkamp’s statement on This Week is overly broad. Heitkamp said, ""We have record bankruptcies in farming country."" In her backyard, the upper Midwest, farm bankruptcies have indeed reached their highest level in at least a decade. But nationally, farm bankruptcies are holding steady, perhaps even falling slightly, and they sit below the levels seen as recently as 2009 to 2012. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBCDAFC0>],/factchecks/2019/feb/26/heidi-heitkamp/does-us-have-record-bankruptcies-farm-country/

Morgan Griffith's claim U.S. has cut greenhouse emissions is tenuous
","Republican Rep. Morgan Griffith, who represents the 9th Congressional District in Southwest Virginia suffering from the decline of coal mining, recently derided Democratic resolutions to end greenhouse emissions in 10 years. The non-binding, identical, non-binding measures, called the ""Green New Deal,"" were introduced Feb. 7 in the House by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and in the Senate by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass. Eighty Democrats have co-sponsored the resolutions, including six announced presidential candidates for 2020. The resolutions call for federal mobilization to curb climate change and protect the environment. They also broadly support Democratic aspirations to increase hourly wages, strengthen labor unions and make higher education accessible ""to all the people of the United States."" The measures don’t lay out specific programs to achieve the goals or revenues to finance them, other than saying the changes will pay for themselves. Griffith, in a Feb. 11 newsletter to constituents, said the environmental reforms were impractical, industry-killing and unnecessary. ""Our country has succeeded in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in previous years,"" he wrote. ""We did it with improved technology that increased energy efficiency and brought down the costs of cleaner fuel sources. This is the blueprint for a future that holds both cleaner air and water and greater prosperity."" We fact-checked Griffith’s claim that the U.S. has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions. Kevin Baird, Griffith’s communications director, told us the statement was based on data published by the Environmental Protection Agency in its ""Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gases and Sinks, 1990-2017."" It’s the latest edition of an annual report, released April 12, 2018. The report shows U.S. greenhouse emissions dropped from a peak 7,371 metric tons in 2007 to 6,472 metric tons in 2017 - the last year available. That’s an 11.8 percent decrease over the span, or an average 1.1 percent yearly decrease. The fall was not steady, however. During four years, emissions went up, during seven years, they went down. Much attention has been focused on the final three years of data. Emissions dropped by 2 percent in both 2015 and 2016, but only three-tenths of 1 percent in 2017. In other words, the rate of decrease was slowing. But there’s a problem: The EPA report Griffith sites is out of date. More recent research indicates greenhouse emissions rose in 2018. The research focuses on carbon dioxide discharges, which account for about 80 percent of greenhouse emissions. A report issued In January 2019 by the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, estimated carbon emissions rose by 3.4 percent in in 2018 - the first increase in four years. That puts carbon emissions at about the same they were in the mid-1990s. The latest records from the Energy Information Administration, a data-collecting unit of the federal Energy Department, show carbon emissions for the first 10 months of 2018 were 3.2 percent higher than discharges during the first 10 months of 2017 Energy analysts generally attribute the slow overall decline in emissions from 2007 to 2017 to energy conservation caused by the Great Recession and its recovery, and the shift in electricity production from coal to natural gas, wind and solar power. On the other hand, Rhodium says the 2018 increase was largely caused by a booming economy that led to more emissions from factories, planes and trucks. Another factor was weather: A cold winter in parts of the country led to an increase in oil and gas consumption for heat. The EIA expects things to slow this year, predicting an 0.2 increase in carbon emissions. Rhodium said it doesn’t ""expect a repeat of 2018 this coming year."" Let’s to return to Griffith. It should be noted that some of the decrease in emissions that he lauds might not have happened if he had succeeded in his goal of reviving the coal industry. Our ruling ""Our country has succeeded in reducing greenhouse emissions in previous years,"" Griffith said in arguing against a Democratic resolution for an all-out effort to end the emissions in a decade. Griffith cites an EPA report released early last year showing emissions dropped 11.8 percent between 2007 and 2017. It went down three straight years between 2015 and 2017, although by declining amounts. But Griffith ignores more current research that alters his picture. The Rhodium Group estimates carbon emissions - the source of most greenhouse gases - increased by 3.4 percent last year. EIA data shows it went up 3.2 during the first 10 months of 2018, compared to the first 10 months of 2017. So you can argue this either way. During the last dozen years, emissions went up five times and down seven. On one hand, they're down 10 percent over the last 12 years; on the other, emissions are at the same level they were in the mid-1990s.

"['Georgia', 'Disability', 'Income', 'Jobs', 'Workers', 'National Federation of the Blind']","
Goodwill faces criticism over pay for disabled workers
","Workers’ wages have become a lightning rod issue recently. Fast-food employees have lobbied for an increase in the minimum wage. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart workers protested low wages at the mega store. And President Barack Obama is now backing a proposal by congressional Democrats to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour and tie it to inflation. The wage discussion has spilled over into jobs for disabled workers as well, with the National Federation of the Blind claiming Goodwill Industries International doesn’t adequately compensate its disabled workers. The NFB recently organized a public awareness campaign with members of local chapters delivering petitions to Goodwill affiliates nationwide asking the company to change its payroll practices that allow ""payment of wages as low as pennies per hour to workers with disabilities."" ""For over seventy years, Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act has allowed employers to obtain special wage certificates that permit them to pay their workers with disabilities wages far less than the federal minimum,"" said a news release from the organization. Is Goodwill really paying some employees pennies per hour? We decided to investigate. Goodwill Industries is a nonprofit organization that provides job training and placement, among other services, to people with disabilities. The company comprises 165 independent, community-based affiliates in the United States and Canada, according to its website. There are four regional Goodwill offices in Georgia. When it comes to pay, Goodwill has long faced criticism. Earlier this year, the company was featured on NBC’s ""Rock Center with Brian Williams"" in a segment claiming that some disabled workers at the company’s Pennsylvania affiliates were paid as little as 22 cents an hour. Forbes reported that some Goodwill workers in Montana earn less than $4 per hour sorting and hanging clothes in stores. Salon and the Huffington Post have also reported on the low wages. Company officials said the cases highlighted in those reports are special cases and were not indicative of Goodwill’s overall pay scale, which has most workers earning at least minimum wage. According to corporate officials, only 64 affiliate agencies pay disabled workers below minimum wage and 101 do not, said Chris Danielsen, the NFB’s spokesman. ""(Goodwill) says it’s a local decision by each affiliate to pay workers below minimum wage. And that this affects only 7,000 workers; our point is that it should not affect any,"" he told PolitiFact Georgia. Critics have also noted the high pay of Goodwill President and CEO Jim Gibbons, who is also blind. An Internal Revenue Service 990 form reports that Gibbons’ pay was more than $508,000 in 2011, plus an additional $217,000 in other compensation. Last year’s report, which is posted on the agency’s website, listed Gibbons’ pay at more than $533,000, plus an additional $99,000 in other compensation. So how is Goodwill allowed to pay workers below the federal minimum wage? And what about disabled workers at Georgia’s Goodwill affiliates, is their pay also lower than $7.25 an hour? In an online response to media reports and questions about its payroll practices, Goodwill Industries highlights the Special Minimum Wage Certificate, authorized under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. This provision, Section 14(c) of the law, allows employers to pay people with disabilities below the federal minimum wage. The organization also produced a position paper on the issue. ""The certificate is not a ‘loophole,’ "" reads the Goodwill corporate statement, which goes on to note, ""eliminating this program would harm -- not help -- people with significant multiple disabilities."" We called each of the four regional Georgia affiliates covering the Atlanta, Columbus, Macon and Savannah areas to determine their compensation policies. There are no workers paid below minimum wage at stores or offices in the Macon region, a spokeswoman told us. The region possesses the 14(c) special wage certificate but doesn’t use it, she said. The North Georgia affiliate, which includes the Atlanta area, does not have the 14(c) certificate and pays all its some 2,500 disabled workers at least minimum wage, a spokeswoman said. All workers in the Columbus region are also paid at least minimum wage, and the affiliate does not have the 14(c) certificate allowing for lower wages. More than 30 percent of the 700 Goodwill employees in the Savannah region are disabled, a spokeswoman said. The region does hold a 14(c) certificate but doesn’t use it, and the lowest hourly wage offered employees in the region is $7.75 an hour. Despite the Georgia results, the state chapter of the NFB has criticized Georgia’s Goodwill affiliates for about two years, asking the regions with the special wage certificates to eliminate them. Nationally, the NFB is supporting congressional legislation, introduced by U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., that would repeal the section of the federal law that allows special wage certificates. Georgia Democratic Congressmen Sanford Bishop and John Lewis have signed on as co-sponsors of the bill. The NFB has started an online Change.org petition for Goodwill Industries International to pay its workers a real wage. Thus far, more than 170,000 people have signed on to the petition. So is the National Federation of the Blind correct that Goodwill Industries pays some disabled employees pennies per hour? Yes and no. The international nonprofit, like other organizations that employ disabled workers, is allowed to pay those employees below minimum wage because of a provision of the federal labor law. For Goodwill, which allows each of its independent affiliates to determine whether to use the reduced wage allowance, the pay scale varies. Some affiliates pay workers minimum wage and even more, while other affiliates do pay extremely low wages, depending on the situation and how much work employees are able to complete. In Georgia, all four affiliates pay disabled workers at least minimum wage. And two affiliates possess the lower wage certificate, which they could eventually decide to use.

Viral blog posts say Obama 'minions' are allowing corporations to sell off Great Lakes water
","These days, President Barack Obama gets blamed for a lot of things -- the glitchy rollout of the healthcare.gov website, an unusually slow economic recovery, an out-of-control electronic surveillance network. But is he also at fault for selling off Lake Michigan’s water to the highest bidder? Several readers recently asked us to check a claim they had seen circulating on social media. The most commonly shared versions seems to have originated on the conservative blog Coach is Right and the website of the Western Center for Journalism, whose president is longtime conservative activist Floyd Brown. The post on the Western Center for Journalism’s site is headlined, ""Barack Obama’s war on America’s fresh water supply."" It reads: ""By using a little-known loophole in the 2006 Great Lakes Compact, Obama minions are allowing Nestle Company to export precious fresh water out of Lake Michigan to the tune of an estimated $500,000 to $1.8 million per day profit. By draining the precious jewel of the Great Lakes in the middle of America, our federal water managers are allowing the export of our water out of our country across thousands of miles of oceans into the Asian basin plagued by huge population centers that are suffering from their constant lack of fresh water."" We did not hear back from the Coach is Right site, but PolitiFact Ohio has previously looked at the question of water being removed from the Great Lakes and found that it was a genuine issue. It stems from an agreement known as the Great Lakes Compact. It was negotiated by and has the force of law in eight states -- Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. (Two Canadian provinces are also involved in Great Lakes water policy decisions, but technically aren’t part of the compact.) The most important provision for this fact-check is its prohibition on diverting water from the Great Lakes basin -- with a key exception. That exception -- the ""loophole"" referred to in the blog post -- is that the compact permits the removal of water in containers of 5.7 gallons or less. The existence of this provision has enabled the bottled-water industry to construct major facilities in the Great Lakes basin, including one by Nestle Waters North America in Mecosta County, Mich. Because the compact was designed to regulate and preserve the Great Lakes -- one of the world’s great natural repositories of fresh water -- such commercial sales have been controversial. Peter Annin, author of The Great Lakes Water Wars, told PolitiFact Ohio that the provision was one of the most emotional issues during the compact’s negotiation. ""Many people opposed the loophole during the negotiations, but each state included it anyway when they passed the legislation,"" said Melissa K. Scanlan, a professor at Vermont Law School who specializes in water law. Legislative fixes have been periodically floated in Congress, but none has yet advanced. So there’s no doubt that the question of whether Great Lakes water should be bottled for sale elsewhere is hotly contested. But does Obama have a role in it? No, experts tell us. Here’s why: • The compact was in force before Obama was even inaugurated. The agreement was negotiated during the mid 2000s, then approved individually in 2007 and 2008 by the legislatures and governors of all eight member states. Then, it was passed by both chambers of Congress and signed by President George W. Bush in 2008. Obama became president in 2009. We should note that Obama was in the U.S. Senate when it passed that chamber. The compact passed the Senate by unanimous consent -- that is, approval without any objections from senators and without a recorded vote of yeas and nays. Still, the heavy legislative lifting was long done by that point, and with so many other state and federal entities weighing in during the lengthy negotiation and approval process, it seems a stretch to attribute primary blame for the ""loophole"" to then-Sen. Obama. • It is a compact among states, not something imposed by the federal government. According to Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitution, the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate and the president must give their approval to an interstate compact. However, once approved, compacts are fundamentally agreements between states, not between the states and the federal government. Several experts told PolitiFact that there is no significant oversight or enforcement role for the federal government in regards to the compact -- in other words, no opportunity for Obama’s ""minions"" to cause havoc. • Elected officials from both parties had a role in approving the compact, and continue to carry out its provisions. State legislatures and governors of both parties approved the compact initially, and today, a majority of the states and legislative chambers that are party to the agreement are actually controlled by Republicans, not Democrats. In Michigan, the state where the Nestle plant is located, the governor’s office and both chambers of the Legislature are in Republican hands. In general, the Great Lakes Compact has been ""very nonpartisan for an environmental policy,"" said Noah Hall, a professor at Wayne State University Law School in Detriot and author of the Great Lakes Law blog. Our ruling Bloggers have said that ""by using a little-known loophole ... Obama minions are allowing Nestle Co. to export precious fresh water out of Lake Michigan."" There is an ongoing debate over whether Great Lakes water should be sold commercially out of the region, but Obama’s role in creating, approving and enforcing the Great Lakes Compact on an ongoing basis -- which is likely the driving reason the claim has attracted attention on social media -- is actually minimal, experts say. In other words, his ""minions"" have not meddled in this dispute. The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC24300>],/factchecks/2013/dec/17/blog-posting/viral-blog-posts-say-obama-minions-are-allowing-co/

About 40 percent of workers 'don't even have a single paid sick day.' Really?
","Panelists on MSNBC’s The Cycle chewed on the topic of mandatory paid leave -- and how it isn’t a thing for all American workers -- on the heels of new legislation from Democrats that would create a program to make it happen. The Family and Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act, sponsored by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., would allow workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid family and sick leave through the creation of a trust fund, administered by the Social Security Administration, that would be funded by contributions from employers and employees of 0.2 percent of earnings (2 cents per $10). One big supporter is the National Partnership for Women and Families, which was very involved in the passage of the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act of 1993 that guaranteed 12 weeks of unpaid leave for most workers. Now, the group is pushing for the law to go even further so that more workers can take off -- and be paid -- during emergencies. America is far behind the modern world in the area of paid leave, said Cycle guest Vicki Shabo, director of work and family programs at the National Partnership for Women and Families, on Dec. 12, 2013. ""About 40 percent of workers don’t even have a single paid sick day,"" Shabo said, ""much less the long-term leave that the FAMILY Act would provide."" We wondered if her statistic was accurate. Her source: the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2013 National Compensation Survey. The data show 61 percent of all private-sector workers were offered paid sick leave, leaving about 40 percent without it. The BLS count for public and private workers, excluding those who are self-employed or work for the federal government, is a tad higher at 65 percent. State and local government workers have a much higher rate of getting paid sick leave compared to other sectors, at about 89 percent. Employees of smaller firms and the leisure and hospitality sector are the least likely to have paid medical leave, the survey shows. The rate of paid sick leave increases with pay level, with the rise of white-collar jobs being the main reason that more workers have access to paid sick leave than 20 years ago. Under current law, workers are eligible for 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year for reasons that include childbirth, caring for a spouse, child or parent with a serious health issue, dealing with a serious health problem of their own, among others. According to the Department of Labor, nearly 60 percent of workers are eligible for unpaid leave through the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act of 1993, and 13 percent reported taking leave under FMLA in the past year. The Gillibrand-DeLauro proposal would provide leave to every worker, including those who work for smaller employers or are self-employed or unemployed, ""as long as the person has sufficient earnings and work history,"" according to a DeLauro press release. The idea is modeled after programs in California and New Jersey. Payments to employees on leave would be equal up to 66 percent of monthly income, capped at a monthly amount. We checked in with the conservative Employment Policies Institute, which opposes pro-labor policies. Research director Michael Saltsman said Shabo's statistic, while accurately sourced, does not account for workers given a pool of hours to use for vacation, illness or personal reasons. Widening the scope shows 77 percent of private-sector workers receive paid vacation time, he said, referencing the BLS. ""Of course, that makes the statistic appear far less 'shocking' than Shabo would like it to be,"" Saltsman said. Consolidated leave plans, which offer employees a block of leave time per year to use for various reasons, are becoming more popular for American workers, particularly those in the insurance and health care sectors, according to the BLS. The BLS found 26 percent of all workers were offered consolidated leave plans in 2012. Our ruling Shabo accurately referenced 2013 federal data when she said, ""About 40 percent of workers don’t even have a single paid sick day."" Saltsman did offer one caveat, however, noting that some workers have a pool of days that can be used for illness or vacation. That caveat is enough to rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE12380>],/factchecks/2013/dec/17/vicki-shabo/about-40-percent-workers-dont-even-have-single-pai/

Pam Bondi says amendment would make Florida one of the most lenient medical marijuana states
","If there’s one issue sure to spark up a debate in Florida, it’s medical marijuana. United for Care, a medical marijuana advocacy group, is in the middle of a petition campaign to place a medicinal cannabis bill on the November ballot. The campaign has until Feb. 1 to qualify, but Attorney General Pam Bondi isn’t waiting that long. On Oct. 24 her office filed a challenge to the Florida Supreme Court, arguing that the summary of the amendment on the ballot is designed to mislead voters. The court heard arguments on Dec. 5, 2013, and has until April 1, 2014, to rule. Among the claims made in the brief is that the 74-word summary doesn’t go far enough to explain the extent of how the amendment would affect state law. ""The proposal hides the fact that the Amendment would make Florida one of the most lenient medical-marijuana states, allowing use for limitless ‘other conditions’ specified by any physician,"" the brief reads. ""With no ‘condition’ off limits, physicians could authorize marijuana for anything, any time, to anyone, of any age,"" it continues. ""But rather than tell voters of this extraordinary scope, the summary uses language to prey on voters’ understandable sympathies for Florida’s most vulnerable patients — those suffering ‘debilitating diseases.’ "" We’re not here to dispute whether the proposal is hiding anything from voters; that’s for the state Supreme Court to decide. But is Florida’s proposed amendment lenient compared with the rest of the country’s medical marijuana laws? It’s going to take us some time to roll that one up. Allowing medical marijuana for 'other conditions' Twenty states currently have medical marijuana laws, and all of them have at least a partial list of specific medical diagnoses that can be treated with cannabis. These diseases typically include cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, or wasting syndromes like cachexia, although the lists vary by state. (We should note that among those 20 states, Colorado and Washington state voted in 2012 to decriminalize marijuana altogether.) The Florida amendment spells out its covered diagnoses as cancer, glaucoma, AIDS, hepatitis C, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. But it also allows for ""other conditions for which a physician believes that medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient."" Any other use would have to fall under that rather open-ended description. It’s the ""other conditions"" that Bondi and others say is a major loophole. Florida Sheriffs Association President Grady Judd has argued that by using the term ""condition,"" there’s a virtually unlimited number of ways that can be applied, including muscle spasms and menstrual cramps. We found that Mostly True. Other state laws use words like ""other conditions"" to allow for diseases or symptoms not mentioned in their statutes. Usually there is a process to petition a state board or other group to allow medical marijuana use for one of those conditions after it’s approved by a doctor. Florida’s law would not require the creation of such a board to approve a disease or symptom not listed -- only that a doctor give a written recommendation.  (To abide by federal law, no state requires a prescription, only a recommendation.) Only two other states, California and Massachusetts, have laws that are that relaxed. Massachusetts only requires written consent from a doctor, while California lets patients get medical marijuana with merely verbal recommendations (for example, a dispensary calls a doctor to verify a patient who doesn’t have written documentation, which is an uncommon occurrence). Neither state requires a board to approve requests. United for Care campaign manager Ben Pollara said the loose requirements for the approval process in Florida was by design. ""Health care decisions should be made between a doctor and their patient not by whether it is included or excluded on an arbitrary list drawn up by lawyers, politicians or bureaucrats,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. Other states have slightly stricter guidelines for what constitutes a non-specified conditions. Alaska, for example, has an approval process for any ""debilitating medical condition"" with symptoms such as pain, nausea or seizures. Montana gives leeway for severe pain with a second doctor’s opinion. New Hampshire makes exceptions for other conditions including severe pain or if current treatments result in side effects like nausea, vomiting or muscle spasms. New Mexico also allows for severe pain, if a doctor and the state agree other treatments won’t work (hospice patients are allowed, too). Vermont will let patients treat severe pain, severe nausea, or seizures if other efforts have failed -- or if those conditions are caused by other treatments. Jennifer Meale, communications director for Bondi’s office, confirmed to PolitiFact Florida that the wording in the initial brief was intended to apply only to the amendment language referring to ""other conditions,"" which are described as ""debilitating diseases"" in the ballot summary. ""Other aspects of the amendment weren’t considered in this way,"" she said. ""That’s the portion that was misleading."" Cultivation, distribution and possession restrictions In regards to overall leniency, however, there is much more to consider than just the definition of what could be covered. The Florida law would not, for instance, protect patients growing their own plants, which 15 states permit to some degree. Michigan and Montana, for example, don’t specify there have to be medical marijuana dispensaries, according to pro-legislation Marijuana Policy Project spokesman Dan Riffle, so cultivation at home is a common method for patients to maintain a supply of the drug. Arizona lets you grow marijuana plants if you live more than 25 miles from a dispensary. Instead, the Florida amendment outlines that the state department of health or some other designated agency must regulate a dispensary network, a requirement by 14 states. (States are limited to regulating the distribution network instead of operating it, lest the states open themselves up to a violation of federal law.) Furthermore, the proposal does not contain wording on possession limits, which also vary by state. ""Most allow 2 to 2.5 ounces, but some are as low as one ounce, and some are as high as 24 ounces,"" Riffle said. ""The Florida initiative leaves that up to the Department of Health to determine, and they'll probably say 1 to 2 ounces if this passes."" Riffle added the amendment also does not carry any protections for housing or employment discrimination against patients or caregivers. One example he gives is how in Arizona, a licensed patient cannot be fired from a job for failing a drug test. The Florida law makes no mention of such instances. Riffle said the Florida proposal overall ""is a relatively average medical marijuana law,"" not as restrictive as places like Connecticut, Illinois or New Jersey, but not as liberal as California, Arizona or Massachusetts. Vanderbilt Law School professor Robert Mikos agreed that by using the term ""conditions"" in its language for recommendations, the Florida amendment is ""on the lenient side."" But, he added, ""it looks like Florida is going the more restrictive route by requiring the use of treatment centers and licensing and regulation through the state."" Even the language for doctor recommendations is a little stricter, he said, such as saying the benefits of approved cannabis use ""would likely outweigh the potential health risks,"" instead of wording it that drug use ""might benefit"" a patient, as is used by some other states. Our ruling Bondi’s office is arguing the proposed Florida Amendment is worded loosely enough in its definitions of what could be treated by the drug that it would put it in league with ""the most lenient medical-marijuana states."" The Florida proposal would allow doctors to make recommendations for marijuana use without getting approval from a designated state agency, a rare guideline. Only two states with medical marijuana laws, California and Massachusetts, allow patients to obtain cannabis this way. But if we look at the amendment’s approach to regulation, distribution and registration, it’s a different picture. Florida actually places plenty of restrictions on these categories, moving the proposal closer to the middle of the pack. Bondi’s brief didn’t focus on those other considerations. Some outside experts feel it’s a little misleading to say Florida will become ""one of the most lenient medical-marijuana states"" without explicitly couching it in terms of getting an unspecified condition approved for treatment with only a doctor’s written recommendation. We rate her statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB58D40>],/factchecks/2013/dec/17/pam-bondi/pam-bondi-says-amendment-would-make-florida-one-mo/

Pam Bondi says medical marijuana is illegal under federal law, with or without amendment
","Almost half the nation has reefer madness these days, with 20 states having passed laws allowing medical marijuana, or outright decriminalizing it. But the office of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi suggests making it crystal clear to voters that even if a proposed constitutional amendment legalizing cannabis for medicinal purposes makes it to the November ballot and passes, users will still be breaking the law -- United States law, that is. ""The summary suggests that medical marijuana is permissible under federal law,"" Bondi’s office said in an initial brief filed Oct. 24, challenging the proposal in Florida Supreme Court. ""In reality, whether the Amendment passes or not, the medical use of marijuana is a federal criminal offense."" With so many states allowing marijuana -- medical or otherwise -- to be consumed by the public, this claim seems to often be overlooked, so we figured it was time to clear the air. Use and abuse Whether the proposed amendment even makes it is dependent on advocates collecting 700,000 confirmed signatures by Feb. 1. Even if the petition is approved, the Florida Supreme Court has until April 1, 2014, to rule on the attorney general’s challenge. If voters pass the law, it would allow registered patients with cancer, glaucoma, AIDS, hepatitis C, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis or other conditions approved by a doctor to obtain marijuana for medicinal purposes. Bondi’s brief also says the law would ""would make Florida one of the most lenient medical-marijuana states, allowing use for limitless ‘other conditions’ specified by any physician,"" a claim we rated Mostly True. All marijuana legislation is written to apply only to state laws. Under the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is defined as having a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. Proponents of decriminalizing marijuana disagree with that definition. Dan Riffle, director of federal policies for the pro-legislation Marijuana Policy Project, said there are obvious, widely used medical applications (such as pain relief and appetite stimulation). He said no other drug, from Lipitor to Oxycodone, must specify its exact use like medical marijuana laws do. But even with that in mind, no matter how many states pass marijuana laws, even advocates like Riffle freely admit that the use, possession, manufacturing and distribution of the drug remains a federal no-no. The Controlled Substances Act imposes strict penalties on marijuana users, growers and sellers. A first misdemeanor offense for possession in any amount can result in a $1,000 fine and a year in prison, climbing for subsequent offenses to as much as $5,000 and three years. Selling cannabis is considered a felony. Punishments range from a $250,000 fine and 5 years in prison to as much as $10 million and up to life for selling 1,000 kilograms or more. Penalties double if the sale is to a minor or within 1,000 feet of a school, playground or public housing. Cultivating cannabis plants carries similar penalties, contingent on the volume. Feds let states take the lead Even with federal law on the books prohibiting marijuana, there are reasons users and distributors aren’t constantly being busted by the Drug Enforcement Agency. There is a continuing debate over state rights versus federal control, and decriminalizing marijuana is a flashpoint. ""Just because federal law bans something doesn’t mean states have to,"" George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin said. Whether the U.S. government can enforce policy that contradicts state law is another matter. The 2005 U.S. Supreme Court case Gonzales vs. Raich established the federal government has the right to use the Commerce Clause of the Constitution to regulate homegrown marijuana, even when it’s for approved medicinal use. DEA officials destroyed Oakland, Calif., resident Angel Raich’s homegrown marijuana plants in 2002, despite the fact Raich’s possession was legal under California’s Proposition 215 medical marijuana law, which was passed in 1996. Raich sued the federal government and lost, but California’s law was not affected. The ruling showed that the federal government cannot force states to criminalize something (marijuana, in this case), but can enforce its own laws. Since then, several states have still shrugged at federal guidelines, passing their own medical marijuana laws. Colorado and Washington state last year decriminalized cannabis use outright. This has led to a recent softening of the federal government’s stance on the drug. On Aug. 29, U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memorandum to federal attorneys that apparently relaxed Washington’s attitudes about marijuana. The memo included new guidelines focusing on cartels or other criminal organizations -- for example, distribution to minors, cultivating plants on public land, committing violence to distribute the drug or using state-regulated operations as a cover for illicit activities. Otherwise, the Justice Department is content to allow state and local agencies ""to address marijuana activity through enforcement of their own narcotics laws."" Indeed, raids of growing operations are infrequent, and prosecution of individuals in those states is nearly unheard of. That’s not to say these guidelines can’t or won’t change, Somin said. When Attorney General Eric Holder or President Barack Obama leave office or if they change their minds, the priorities of the Justice Department may shift again. Federal prosecutors could ignore the guidelines and root out medical marijuana users anyway. United for Care, the group pushing for the Florida initiative, said the lack of enforcement is an integral part of what makes medical marijuana laws possible, and is at the heart of the proposed amendment. ""Our aim is not to set up a marijuana business,"" campaign manager Ben Pollara said. ""We want safe access to medical marijuana."" Bondi’s office, meanwhile, doesn’t see it that way. ""Currently it is illegal,"" communications director Jennifer Meale said. ""Whether there are other considerations doesn’t change the fact that it is illegal."" Our ruling There are a lot of talking points about medical marijuana being passed around in Florida, but one immutable fact underlies the pro- and anti-marijuana lobbies: The federal government considers cannabis an illegal drug by law. Whether that’s the way it should be depends on your point of view. Proponents point to current federal administrative guidelines that deprioritize marijuana prosecution, saying that state preferences equal de facto law. The state attorney general says that even if the U.S. Attorney General’s Office says it’s not focusing on medical marijuana laws, that doesn’t change the Controlled Substances Act. Only Congress could do that. Even with the caveats implied by the U.S. government’s recent guidance, Bondi’s office declared ""whether the Amendment passes or not, the medical use of marijuana is a federal criminal offense."" Whether you’re a supporter of states’ rights or not, she’s correct. We rate this statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4C7EB15C0>],/factchecks/2013/dec/17/pam-bondi/pam-bondi-says-medical-marijuana-illegal-under-fed/

Obenshain says vote recounts have reversed 3 of the 4 closest statewide elections
","With the statewide vote recount for attorney general kicking into gear this week, Republican Mark Obenshain is citing history to back his hope that his razor-thin loss to Democrat Mark Herring last month will be reversed. ""Of the four statewide races this century within a 300-vote margin, three have been overturned in a recount,"" Obenshain said in a Nov. 27 news release announcing his decision to seek the recount. We looked into Obenshain’s claim. Let’s start with some background. The official election count, certified Nov. 25, named Herring the winner by 165 votes, or 0.007 percent of the more than 2.2 million ballots cast. Obenshain filed a recount petition on Nov. 27. The recount will simply retabulate results from Nov. 5 election. Vote tallies can change if: * the results were incorrectly counted; * some ballots were included that should have been ruled invalid; * if apparent undervotes or overvotes were not tallied but should have been. Undervotes occur when voters fail to clearly select a candidate. Overvotes occur when voters appear to mark more than one candidate in a race. Now, let’s return to Obenshain’s statement on recounts in other states. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Obenshain’s campaign, said the statistic came from a report by The Center for Voting and Democracy from 2011. Of the 2,884 statewide general elections in the U.S. from 2000 to 2009, only 18 had recounts and 11 had a margin of victory of 0.15 percent or less. The average margin swing was 296 votes in those 18 recounts and the median swing was 229 votes. The report cited four recounts in the past decade in which the winner and leading loser were divided by 300 votes. Other than Virginia’s attorney general election, there have been no races between candidates to add to the list since 2009. Here’s what happened in the other states: Montana, 2000 About 63,000 people cast ballots in the Democratic primary for superintendent of public school instruction and only 64 votes separated the top two candidates. Linda McCulloch maintained her lead through the recount, eventually beating Gail Gray by 61 votes. Washington, 2004 Democrat Christine Gregoire won the governor’s race after a second recount -- by hand -- gave her a 130-vote edge over Republican Dino Rossi out of 2.7 million ballots cast. Rossi had won the original count by 261 votes and an automatic machine recount by 42 votes. During the hand recount, 700 additional absentee ballots from King County were included that had originally been wrongly disqualified. Republican unsuccessfully challenged the results in court and legal wranglings continued well into the following year. Vermont, 2006 On election night, counters incorrectly transferred results on tally sheets in the state auditors race, crediting some votes for a third-party candidate instead of the Democratic challenger, Thomas Salmon. The mistakes happened in a few communities that used paper ballots. During a recount, 239 votes changed. Salmon, originally runner-up,  won by 102 votes over Republican incumbent Randy Brock. Minnesota, 2008 Incumbent U.S. Sen. Norm Coleman, a Republican, won the original count over Democrat Al Franken by 215 votes out of 2.4 million cast ballots. During a hand recount, Coleman maintained a 192-vote lead. But challenges which were eventually settled by the Minnesota Supreme Court led, among other things  to the counting of nearly 1,000 absentee ballots that were initially excluded. In the end, Franken won by 312 votes. Two experts told us there are important differences between what happened in the other states and Virginia. The experts were Charles Stewart III, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Edward Foley, a professor at Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law, who is writing a book on the history of disputed elections in the United States. Because Virginia largely votes by electronic process, they say a smaller percentage of ballots from the attorney general race will be subjected to hand recounting than were in Washington and Minnesota. Experts also note that Washington and Minnesota had more liberal voting laws than Virginia that led to the addition of some ballots for counting during the recounts in both of those states. ""Experts are assuming the change is going to be tiny,"" Stewart said.  ""But even a tiny change could affect the outcome, although that’s highly unlikely, at this point."" In Virginia, ballots ruled invalid in the original count cannot be reintroduced. To include additional ballots -- which may have been improperly excluded -- a candidate must contest the race to the General Assembly,  which is a step beyond a recount.   Virginia also requires that all optical scan ballots, in which voters mark their preferences by filling in circles or squares similar to those found on standardized tests, be included in recounts. They will be re-run through tabulation machines; overvotes and undervotes will be weeded out and counted manually. The Virginia Public Access Project estimated that more than 700,000 optical scan ballots were cast in the November election. In addition, the process will include a hand count of absentee and provisional ballots, a tally of tapes printed by direct-recording electronic voting machines, and reprint and recount of any illegible tapes printed on election night. Our ruling Obenshain said that three of the four statewide races this century within a 300-vote margin have been overturned in a recount. He’s right, although sets of circumstances in these three upturned elections in other states do not translate to the Virginia recount that Obenshain hopes will improve his second-place finish in last month’s attorney general race.

Senate candidate blasts opponents' absent when it counts
","What’s the best way to attempt to shame a conservative congressman and score some political points? Compare him unfavorably with the most powerful Democrat in Congress, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Eugene Yu, an upstart Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, recently launched a website that attacked the voting attendance records of three GOP House members who are also vying for the Senate seat: Paul Broun, Phil Gingrey and Jack Kingston. ""Harry Reid has a better voting attendance record than these three Congressmen!"" the website says. Yu’s point near the bottom of the website: ""Their subpar voting records are evidence they are not representing you in Washington."" Yu plans to air television ads making the claim, Morris News Service reported. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Yu’s claim was hyperbole or the truth. Yu’s claim came out close to the same time as an Atlanta Journal-Constitution report that Broun, over a two-year stretch, missed more than 80 percent of the meetings of a congressional Border and Maritime Security panel while being highly critical of federal border security. Yu, a South Korean immigrant whose campaign website notes he served in the U.S. Army and as a Richmond County sheriff’s deputy, used the nonpartisan website Govtrack.us as the basis for his claim. The website logs the votes of each member of Congress -- and when they didn’t vote. Here are the percentages of votes missed for each congressman, according to the website: Gingrey    3.9 percent Broun        3.7 percent Kingston    3.5 percent Reid        1.1 percent The website says the percentage of votes missed by each of the three Georgia members is above the congressional median of 2.3 percent. Case closed? Not entirely, we thought. PolitiFact Georgia looked at the Govtrack.us website and did an apples-to-apples comparsion of the voting records of the four men from the same time period, since each congressman joined Congress in different years. We chose July 2007, since that was the year Broun came to Washington. Broun has the shortest tenure of the four congressmen. Reid, Kingston and Gingrey joined Congress in 1987, 1993 and 2003, respectively. What we noticed is that the three Georgia members had voted nearly three times as often as Reid, a senator from Nevada, since July 2007. The House held more than 5,000 votes since July 2007 while the Senate, where Reid serves, had about 1,850 votes during the same time span. The House has more than four times as many members as the Senate. House members file more pieces of legislation. Since July 2007, Gingrey missed 4.9 percent of House votes, the highest of the three Georgia members, our review of Govtrack’s records shows. Broun missed 3.5 percent of House votes during that time span while Kingston missed 3 percent of those votes. On the Senate side, Reid missed 0.3 percent of the votes. Still, since the House votes more frequently than the Senate, is this a fair comparison? We mentioned this to the Yu campaign, and the candidate’s Augusta campaign office manager, Cole Watkins, sent us a reply via email. ""What is important is that our elected officials take the voice of the Georgians to Washington for every vote and every committee meeting,"" Watkins wrote. ""If they feel that they are overworked, then it is time for them to step down."" Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford said the congressman ""strives to make every vote"" but sometimes can’t do so because of illness and family emergencies. Crawford said Reid’s position as majority leader gives him an advantage in terms of voting. ""Senator Reid sets the vote schedule in the Senate, which should make it nearly impossible for him to miss votes,"" Crawford said. To sum up, Yu claimed on a website that Reid has a better voting attendance record than three Georgia congressmen that Yu is running against for the U.S. Senate. The numbers show he’s correct. But Reid votes far less than the House members. To us, it’s akin to comparing a baseball player who’s been up to bat 190 times to another who’s had 500 plate appearances. Yu’s claim needs a little context to be fully explained. Under our rating system, this one meets the definition of a Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA7DA40>],/factchecks/2013/dec/17/eugene-yu/senate-candidate-blasts-opponents-absent-when-it-c/

Fundamentalist: When founders said 'religion,' they meant Christianity
","Correction: Thomas Jefferson wrote about religious tolerance in the context of a proposed Virigina law. An earlier version offered a different context. This item was updated at 4:40 p.m. Dec. 16, 2013, to reflect that change. There’s nothing like the holidays to bring out the fault lines at the intersection of religion and the state. The New York-based Satanic Temple stirred things up in Oklahoma when it announced that it was submitting plans for a statehouse monument that speaks to its beliefs. This comes several years after Oklahoma lawmakers granted permission for a private group to put up a 10 commandments monument on the capitol lawn. The Satanists say if lawmakers are okay with the 10 commandments, they have to accept all religious representations. Christian fundamentalist talk show host Bryan Fischer said Satanism enjoys no such protection. ""By the word religion in the First Amendment, the founders meant Christianity,"" Fischer said on an American Family Radio broadcast. We thought we’d go to the historic record to see if that claim hews closely to the facts. Fischer said in the second half of the 18th century, the overwhelming majority of the people were Christians. Jews accounted for less than 1 percent, Fischer estimated. The founders, he said, lived in a particular religion environment. ""They weren’t providing any cover or shelter for the free exercise of Islam or even Judaism or even atheism,"" he said. ""They weren’t prohibiting that. They were just saying, that is not what we are talking about here."" Fischer told PunditFact that he relied on the 1833 writings of U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Joseph Story. President James Madison nominated Story to the court in 1811. Story had a narrow view of the First Amendment. ""The real object of the amendment was, not to countenance, much less to advance Mahometanism, or Judaism, or infidelity, by prostrating Christianity,"" Story wrote, ""but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects."" At least some of the actual founders voiced contrary views. Thomas Kidd, professor of history at Baylor University and the author of God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution, said ""the founders were certainly aware of other religions besides Christianity, and discussed them at length in their writings."" Kidd pointed us to a 1818 letter from John Adams: ""This country has done much. I wish it would do more; and annul every narrow idea in religion, government and commerce,"" Adams wrote. ""It has pleased the providence of the first cause, the universal cause, that Abraham should give religion not only to Hebrews, but to Christians and Mohomitans, the greatest part of the modern civilized world."" Benjamin Franklin also weighed in on the subject. Jan Ellen Lewis, professor of history at Rutgers University, cited Franklin’s autobiography, when he praised a new meeting house built in Philadephia. ""The design in building not being to accommodate any particular sect, but the inhabitants in general,"" Franklin wrote. ""So that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at his service."" In his autobiography, Thomas Jefferson spoke directly to the debate over the crafting of a Virginia statute for religious freedom. Jefferson describes a proposal to add the phrase ""the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy author of our religion."" ""The insertion was rejected by a great majority,"" Jefferson wrote, ""In proof that they meant to comprehend, within the mantle of its protection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo, and Infidel of every denomination."" John Ragosta, the Robert C. Vaughan Fellow at the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, pointed us to that excerpt. Ragosta did not dispute that the great majority of people in America were Christians, but he said that makes the vision of the founders that much more impressive. ""They were looking to the future,"" Ragosta said. ""They knew that other people would come to America … and that the rights that they were discussing were universal."" The historians we reached acknowledged that not every founder shared these beliefs. Still, those contrary views did not carry the day. Fischer also stated that the First Amendment did not apply to the states. Our experts agreed that originally, the states enjoyed the power to foster a particular religion. ""Massachusetts retained their state church until 1833,"" Kidd said. ""Various states banned non-Christians from holding state office."" But over time Ragosta said, many states themselves overturned such laws, before the Supreme Court declared them unconstitutional in 1961. Our ruling Fischer said that when the founders used the word ""religion"" in the First Amendment, they meant Christianity. Fischer cites one Supreme Court justice who expressed that view in 1833. On the other side, we have the writings of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, and the opinions of scholars. We were unable to find much merit to this claim. We rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFC70C0>],/factchecks/2013/dec/16/bryan-fischer/fundamentalist-when-founders-said-religion-they-me/

Religious activist group says ENDA would discriminate against Christians
","Early in the 2014 campaign season, religion has played an important role in the Arkansas Senate race. Incumbent Mark Pryor, a Democrat, released an ad recently about how the Bible guides him. Interestingly, when the National Republican Senatorial Committee attacked Pryor on the issue, challenger Rep. Tom Cotton’s office went against fellow Republicans to stand with Pryor. But that’s not where the debate about Pryor’s faith ends. It circles back to his November vote in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a bill that would prevent workplace discrimination based on sexuality and gender identity. It passed in the Senate but hasn’t been taken up by the House. While the bill’s status is in flux, the debate among lawmakers, advocacy groups and religious leaders continues. The Traditional Values Coalition, a religious activist group, criticized Pryor for his ENDA vote. Andrea Lafferty, the coalition’s president, highlighted a perceived contradiction of Pryor’s religious beliefs in a Dec. 6 mass fundraising email. ""There's a reason why Pryor is attempting to run as a Christian in Arkansas,"" she said. ""It's because Pryor has voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in Washington, a bill that discriminates against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, and the rights of religious freedom."" PolitiFact wanted to take a closer look at how religious organizations would fare if the bill becomes law. American Christianity and LGBT rights Before we take a look at the bill, let’s contextualize the coalition’s claim in the broader context of American Christianity. It’s important to note that within Christianity, gay rights is a divisive and complex issue. The Traditional Values Coalition’s ENDA disapproval is shared by other Christian groups, like the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. They expressed their view in an Oct. 31 press release: ""The USCCB continues to promote the dignity of both work and marriage and to oppose unjust discrimination on any grounds, including those related to homosexual inclination or sexual identity. But we cannot support a bill, like ENDA, that does not justly advance the dignity of all workers and authentic non-discrimination."" At the same time, groups like ReconcilingWorks, a Lutheran group that welcomes gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) members, support ENDA’s passage. ""ReconcilingWorks: Lutherans for Full Participation believes that all hardworking people — including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people — should have a fair chance to earn a living and provide for their families without fear of being fired for reasons that have nothing to do with their job performance,"" spokesman Tim Fisher said. ""We strongly support the passage of ENDA."" As the gay rights movement gains more traction, some Christians have changed their perspectives. ""Most American Christians do not want a gay pastor overseeing their church, and that is not likely to change soon,"" said Kate Bowler, an American Christianity professor at Duke University. ""However, we are seeing thawing numbers of those who agreed that gay people should be allowed same-sex unions."" The basics The ENDA bill would prohibit private-sector employers and government employers on the local, state and federal levels from discriminating against employees based on sexual orientation and gender identity. That protects people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender. Under the law, employers can’t fire or refuse to hire people based on actual or perceived sexuality and gender identity (which need not align with a person’s biological identity). Churches and other institutions with religious purposes (like schools and daycares) are exempt from the ENDA rules, just as they are from the religious discrimination portion of the Civil Rights Act of 1964’s Title VII. Under Title VII, and therefore under ENDA, religious organizations, which need not be church-run, would be exempt. Additionally, all businesses with fewer than 15 employees are exempt, whether they’re religious or not. Nelson Tebbe, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who specializes in religious liberty, said ENDA’s religious exemption exceeds Title VII’s. ""It’s broader because the religious exemption in Title VII only allows religious organizations to discriminate on the basis of religion,"" he said. But it doesn’t allow religious groups to discriminate based on factors like an employee’s gender or race. So by permitting religious organizations to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, ENDA allows them more flexibility than Title VII. Let’s break down the Traditional Values Coalition claim to see how each mention would be treated if ENDA becomes law: Daycare: ""If it were a secular daycare that just happened to be owned by a religious individual with a conviction that prohibited them from hiring LGBT folk, then the exemption would not apply,"" Tebbe said. He added that nonprofit daycares with religious affiliations would be exempt. Parents: ""There is nothing in ENDA that would require parents to alter their beliefs or what they teach their children about religion, homosexuality, marriage equality, et cetera,"" said Ian Thompson, an American Civil Liberties Union representative for LGBT issues. Business owners: For-profit companies with 15 employees or more would need to abide by ENDA, said Dena Sher, an ACLU religious liberty counsel. But Christian nonprofits and Christian (or any other) businesses with fewer than 15 employees would be exempt. Tebbe also noted that religious organizations who don’t hire LGBT people are protected under ENDA. Rights of religious freedom: ""Not only does the Constitution protect religious freedom broadly, but existing federal discrimination law already prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion,"" Thompson said. The Traditional Values Coalition doesn’t believe that these religious exemptions are broad enough. ""ENDA would not cover any secular companies and organizations that are run by committed Christians,"" said Harry Mihet, a Liberty Counsel lawyer the coalition referred us to. Mihet is correct. But as far as discrimination goes, in the bill’s full text, there’s no reference to Christianity, or to any other individual religion, for that matter. All religions are treated the same and can legally invoke the same exemption. And Christianity isn’t the only religion that has historically grappled with acceptance of sexuality and gender identity issues. Merriam-Webster defines discrimination as ""the practice of unfairly treating a person or group of people differently from other people or groups of people."" To say that the law discriminates against Christians doesn’t fit based on our experts’ interpretation of the bill and the inclusion of an overall religious exemption that applies to any religion, not just Christians. ""If you had some exemption that wasn’t available to Christians, that would be discrimination,"" said Doug Laycock, a law and religious studies professor at the University of Virginia. ""The only way they’re treated differently is they get an exemption."" Our ruling The Traditional Values Coalition said ENDA discriminates ""against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, and the rights of religious freedom."" The bill’s religious exemption indicates that churches, church-run initiatives and other religious businesses need not comply by employing people of all sexualities and gender identities. And there’s no special negative treatment for Christians. Businesses of any religion could qualify for the exemption. Individuals of any faith who oppose sexuality would have to abide by the law, so no religion is singled out. We can understand why religious conservatives may take issue with this bill. However, the rhetoric in the email is too broad and overstated, and claims to speak for all Christians. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDFA9C0>],/factchecks/2013/dec/16/traditional-values-coalition/religious-activist-group-says-enda-would-discrimin/

Bob Schieffer says Iran President Hassan Rouhani has more cabinet members with American Ph.D.s than Obama
","Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is seen as a moderate more willing to engage the West, in part because of the backgrounds of his closest advisers. Unlike brash, hard-lined predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Rouhani nominated several cabinet members with advanced degrees from other countries -- a fact that surfaced during a discussion on the Iranian nuclear deal moderated by Bob Schieffer of CBS’ Face the Nation. ""I was very interested that I read, I think it was in The Atlantic, that Rouhani has more cabinet members with Ph.D.s from American universities, he has more of those in his cabinet than President (Barack) Obama does,"" Schieffer said at the Dec. 9, 2013, forum at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Intrigued by the point, we wanted to know if it was true. Just days earlier, The Atlantic published ""The Case for Giving Iran's Scholar-Diplomats a Chance"" by contributing editor Moisés Naím, a senior associate in international economics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. His column began with exactly the information we were looking for: Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, has more cabinet members with Ph.D. degrees from U.S. universities than Barack Obama does. In fact, Iran has more holders of American Ph.D.s in its presidential cabinet than France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, or Spain — combined. What’s the significance? The cabinet of scholars could launch a new chapter in Iran’s typically troubled relations with western countries and negotiations over its nuclear program -- or not, Naím wrote, since the country’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, ultimately calls the shots. ""But compared to the kind of people that Ahmadinejad had in his cabinet, they were a very different kind of crowd,"" Naím told PunditFact by phone. ""So one would expect people with American Ph.D.s to be more sophisticated, more integrated in the world."" His piece singled out three Iranian cabinet officials from the 30-position body with American degrees. PunditFact verified each of the following officials graduated from these American universities: Mohammad Agha Nahavandian, Rouhani’s chief of staff, was awarded a Ph.D. in economics on Jan. 30, 1994, from George Washington University. Mohammad Javad Zarif, the country’s foreign affairs minister, completed his Ph.D. in international law and politics at the University of Denver in 1988. Zarif, who was the lead negotiator in the nuclear deal, was Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations based in New York. Ali Akbar Salehi, a vice president and head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, earned a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1977. Several other members of Rouhani’s Cabinet graduated from universities in Europe, according to Naím’s piece. His minister of information and communications technology, Mahmoud Vaezi, enrolled at a doctoral program at Louisiana State University after studying at other American schools but ended up finishing his Ph.D. in international relations at Warsaw University in Poland. Even Rouhani earned a doctorate from Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland, and several other members have advanced degrees from Iranian universities. Rouhani’s cabinet has an important role in preparing policy and budgets, but it’s not all that powerful because decisions can be overruled by the supreme leader’s office and the Guardian Council, which is appointed by the supreme leader and considers legislation, said Alex Vatanka, an expert on Iran at the Middle East Institute. The U.S. Cabinet does not face similar wildcards, he said. ""There is no sort of element of surprise in the middle of it with one of the priests coming from nearby churches saying, ‘No, no, this is ungodly and shouldn’t be done’,"" Vatanka said. ""The cabinet has been a way for the president to cautiously advance a reform agenda in Iran,"" said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He pointed out that another Rouhani adviser who is not in the cabinet, Mahmood Sariolghalam, earned a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California. How does Obama’s Cabinet compare? There are a couple of ways of looking at Obama’s Cabinet, and neither measure produces more doctoral degrees from American universities than the three we confirmed in Iran. The U.S. cabinet is stacked with lawyers, which is pretty typical. The advisory group includes Vice President Joe Biden and the leaders of 15 executive agencies. Of those, just one has an American Ph.D. Ernest Moniz, Obama’s energy secretary, has no fewer than four honorary degrees. The one that counts for our purpose is his doctorate in theoretical physics from Stanford University. If you expand the pool to include seven more Cabinet-rank officials listed on the same White House page, you find another doctorate. That’s Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, who earned a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University (as well as master’s degrees in government from Harvard and in economics from the London School of Economics). Our ruling Bob Schieffer referenced an Atlantic piece when he said Rouhani’s cabinet has more members with Ph.D.s from American universities than Obama’s. While we could not nail down the academic background of each member of Iran’s cabinet, we found enough members with verifiable degrees -- three -- to deem his statement accurate. Obama has two, including one official with Cabinet-rank. What it all means for international relations remains to be seen. We rate Schieffer’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB6E580>],/factchecks/2013/dec/16/bob-schieffer/bob-schieffer-says-iran-president-hassan-rouhani-h/

Viral post claims Barack Obama has begun a 'nationwide Muslim outreach program' for schoolkids
","Several readers recently asked us to check a claim that’s been spreading widely through chain emails and on social media -- that the Obama administration is pursuing a ""nationwide Muslim outreach program for children"" in grades K through 12. Here’s some of the text that usually accompanies the claim: ""At a press conference today, President Obama announced plans for the first ever federally funded Muslim outreach program. The program will be available nationwide for all elementary school students grade K-12 beginning February 1st, 2014. The program is designed to educate children about the fundamentals of the Muslim religion and Islamic belief. ""President Obama spoke with reporters to explain why it is so important that these outreach programs exist. ‘The Muslim community deserves our full understanding and respect,’ Obama said. ‘We have killed millions of Muslims overseas since the September 11th attacks. These folks are not all bad. In fact, most of them are hard-working citizens just like you and me. I encourage every student in America to participate in your school’s Muslim outreach program. Learn about the Muslim community, the beauty of the Sunnah and the magic of the Qur’an.’"" The item cited ""35-year-old Paul Horner, a teacher at Starks Elementary School in Louisiana,"" who purportedly told MSNBC that he is ""excited about the new program,"" because ""if Becky has a D+ in math she can take a three week after-school class on the Qur’an and would then have an A in Math. That’s a win-win for everyone!"" It closed by urging any parents of students who ""would like to volunteer and teach the Muslim religion"" to ""call the Nationwide Muslim Youth Outreach hotline at (202) 863-8500."" This all sounded fishy to us, so we checked with the White House, which confirmed that no such press conference had ever happened. Nor was there any such program. We also rooted around the Internet and discovered that a portion of the text originated with an ""article"" in the National Report, a satire website. In fact, when we fact-checked the previous iteration of the claim from National Report in October 2013 -- that ""Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month"" -- we rated that Pants on Fire. This is only the latest example of satire passed off as truth on the Internet. We took a detailed look at the phenomenon here. The recently circulating item about the Muslim outreach program included some of the same language as the National Report item, but it was substantially rewritten. Not only was the topic somewhat different, but the quote from ""Horner"" was added, among other things. (The website of Starks High School in Starks, La., -- which includes students from K-12 -- does not include any staff member by that name.) In addition, the phone number listed as being for the ""Nationwide Muslim Youth Outreach hotline"" was actually the phone number of the Republican National Committee. RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski confirmed that the RNC had nothing to do with the piece. ""We’ve gotten calls from people giving us a heads up about this. We didn’t have anything to do with this and are telling people as much when they call,"" she said. The furthest back we could trace the language was to a Dec. 7, 2013, post on the website Conservative Frontline. While the National Report acknowledges that its stories ""are not reflective of the fine journalistic and editorial integrity of National Report"" and at one time included a disclaimer that that ""all news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news,"" we could not find any indication that Conservative Frontline is designed to be a satire site. It includes an array of articles from a conservative perspective and sometimes conspiracy theories, but does not appear to be full of satire articles. From there it spread through conservative blogs, passed off, apparently, as truth. Conservative Frontline did not offer any contact information on its website, so we were unable to reach its staff. Our ruling Social media posts have reprinted or linked to a story titled, ""Obama Administration Announces Nationwide Muslim Outreach Program For Children Grades K-12,"" that claims, among other things, that school children can earn higher grades for studying Islam.  It’s not true. No such program exists. In fact, part of the story has been recycled from a previous satire article that we and others debunked.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Sam Houston']","
Sam Houston in private practice longer than Greg Abbott was at start of AG job
","The only Democrat running for Texas attorney general claims more experience in practicing law than the incumbent started the job with. Sam Houston, a Houston lawyer unrelated to the historical figure of the same name, includes this on his campaign website: ""As a practicing Texas attorney with 26 years of experience, Sam Houston would enter the Attorney General’s office with almost twice the actual experience practicing law than did Greg Abbott."" It’s an all-lawyer field bidding to replace gubernatorial hopeful Abbott, though state law doesn’t require that the attorney general be a practicing lawyer. The Republicans running in the March 2014 primary are state Rep. Dan Branch of Dallas, who chairs the House Higher Education Committee, who got his law license in 1983, according to the State Bar of Texas’ website; freshman state Sen. Ken Paxton of McKinney, vice chair of the Senate Transportation Committee and former House member licensed to practice law in 1991; and Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Barry Smitherman of Austin, licensed in 1984. Houston told us by phone that though he’s not addressing his potential opponents’ experience with this claim, he is making a statement about elected officials holding the position. ""What I think is wrong with the AG’s office is it’s been politicized,"" he said. ""I frankly think litigation experience is extremely important,"" he said, naming skills such as deciding which cases to pursue and advising clients. The attorney general acts as the state’s chief lawyer, whose duties as identified in the Texas Constitution include representing Texas in state Supreme Court cases, preventing corporations from exercising illegal powers or collecting illegal taxes and giving legal advice to state officials.   Both Abbott and his predecessor, John Cornyn, were judges before becoming attorney general, Houston noted. ""It’s a fine thing to be a judge, but that’s a different skill set,"" he said. Abbott and Houston both got bachelor’s degrees at the University of Texas; Houston’s law degree is from Baylor University and Abbott’s from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. According to the bar association, Abbott’s law license is dated Nov. 8, 1985, and Houston’s Nov. 6, 1987. News stories from Texas papers covering Abbott’s past campaigns and positions said he started his law career at Butler and Binion in Houston. There, the Dallas Morning News wrote Oct. 22, 2002, Abbott ""focused on tort litigation, doing work for banks and defending hospitals against malpractice claims."" Abbott was elected a state trial judge in Harris County’s 129th District Court in 1992 and served three terms. Appointed by then-Gov. George W. Bush to the Texas Supreme Court in 1995, Abbott started there in 1996 and won election twice to stay there. He resigned in June 2001 to run for another office, the news stories said, meantime becoming an appellate lawyer at Bracewell and Patterson in Austin. Human resources assistant Vira Santellena at the Houston office of the firm, now called Bracewell and Giuliani, told us by phone that Abbott was employed there from August 2001 through November 2002. In November 2002, Abbott defeated Democrat Kirk Watson, now a state senator from Austin, and was sworn in as attorney general Dec. 2, 2002. Judging by the dates involved, Abbott lawyered for Butler and Binion seven years, from about November 1987 through November 1992, then a year and a half at Bracewell and Patterson. That’d round up to nine years of private practice. Mary Bell, a spokeswoman for Houston, told us by phone, ""What we’re saying is if you add up his private practice, that’s nine years."" As she emailed us career information on both men, she added, ""If you were to include"" Abbott’s ""time on the bench as time he was a practicing attorney, the total years is 17. Sam enters this race as a candidate with 26 years as a practicing attorney."" Houston’s career is easier to sum up because he’s worked since 1992 for a firm he helped start -- Shepherd, Scott, Clawater and Houston, formerly Cruse, Scott, Henderson and Allen. The firm changed its name in April 2010, office administrator Regina Thompson told us by phone. After law school, according to news stories and Bell’s information, Houston began in 1987 at Andrews Kurth in Houston. Thompson said he started with Cruse, Scott on the firm’s first day, June 1, 1992, and is now a co-managing partner. A Feb. 25, 2008, Houston Chronicle news story about Houston’s 2008 state Supreme Court bid said Houston had been doing ""mostly civil defense work, but he also has represented plaintiffs."" Starting the clock in November 1987, Houston’s lawyering experience will total 27 years by the 2014 election. To count or not to count Abbott’s nine-ish years on the bench? We can see one school of thought might be that most people think of ""practicing law"" as representing clients. Then again, the state Supreme Court counts years on the bench toward the requirement that its justices must have practiced law for 10 years (district judges need only have been licensed in Texas for four years). Houston asked us to look at specific parts of the state’s codes of judicial conduct and the law governing the Texas bar.   The code of conduct says a Texas judge ""shall not practice law except as permitted by state law or this code""; exceptions we saw mostly allow judges to give legal advice to or draft documents for their own families and teach or write about law. State law on what constitutes ""unauthorized conduct of law"" says, ""In this chapter the ‘practice of law’ means"" preparing a plea or other document in response to legal action, managing such an action or acting on behalf of a client in court, as well as services outside court such as giving advice or drafting wills and contracts. In addition, reference librarian Ruth Harrison at the Texas State Law Library found us the Black’s Law Dictionary definition for ""practice of law,"" which makes no mention of judicial experience: The professional work of a duly licensed lawyer, encompassing a broad range of services such as conducting cases in court, preparing papers necessary to bring about various transactions from conveying land to effecting corporate mergers, preparing legal opinions on various points of law, drafting wills and other estate-planning documents, and advising clients on legal questions. Our ruling Houston, who’s nearing 27 years of private practice, said he would have ""almost twice the actual experience practicing law"" that Abbott did on taking office. That would require Houston to have 18 years’ experience if only Abbott’s private practice is tallied, but 34 years if Abbott’s time as a judge is counted We rate Houston’s claim as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Pro-stadium group paints an incomplete picture
","If you think Cobb County should spend more money on schools, not a taxpayer-funded home for the Atlanta Braves, a pro-stadium organization wants you to think again. A glossy mailer funded by Revitalize Cobb, a nonprofit interest group, says that a new stadium will bring more education dollars. Just do the math. ""9,241 New Jobs + $295,000,000 in Wages + $0 Tax Increase for Homeowners + $3,000,000 Annually for Cobb Schools = 1 Great Deal for Cobb Residents,"" the ad said. Put this way, bringing the Braves to Cobb does seem like a no-brainer. But we here at PolitiFact Georgia know enough to question any number we meet. We asked the Truth-O-Meter to check Revitalize Cobb’s arithmetic. PolitiFact will check Revitalize Cobb’s jobs and wages figures in an upcoming story. The additional schools money would come from a $400 million retail and entertainment district that the Braves plan to build adjacent to the stadium, a representative for the group explained in an email. The group says there will be no tax increase for homeowners because the stadium won’t cause their tax bills to rise. Both estimates are conservative, the spokesman said, especially since the money for schools does not include income from sales taxes. First, let’s consider the claim that there would be no property tax increase. It isn’t as straightforward as it might seem. Before the Braves stadium plan, property taxes were set to decrease. Cobb homeowners currently pay taxes to pay for parkland. Once this bill is paid off in 2017 and 2018, these taxes are gone. If Cobb commissioners do nothing, homeowners’ yearly tax bill would drop by about $20 for a $200,000 home. But now that the Braves stadium is in the works, to pay the county’s $300 million share of the bill, commissioners will have to vote to increase property taxes for the general fund by the amount they would have decreased. Whether this counts as a ""$0 tax increase for homeowners"" is debatable. In 2019, a Cobb homeowner’s tax rate may be the same as it is now, but it will be higher than it would have been if the Braves had stayed in downtown. (The county plans to exempt homeowners from a special tax it will levy for properties near the new stadium, said James Pehrson, Cobb County’s finance director. Owners of apartment buildings will pay the special tax, and experts say landlords often pass such costs on to tenants.) Now, let’s consider the claim that the Braves will bring $3 million annually for Cobb schools. These funds would come from property taxes on the Braves’ planned retail and entertainment district, which is slated to open ahead of the 2017 season. Early plans for the first phase of the project describe a pedestrian boulevard with stores, restaurants and maybe a hotel. A second phase is supposed to have residences and office space. Revitalized Cobb made its education dollars claim based on a back-of-the-envelope calculation. Its calculations show that under current tax rates, a $400 million property would produce some $6 million each year in additional property tax revenue. Schools would receive about $3.02 million, which is some $3 million higher than the $143,000 the land currently produces for schools. But  there is no guarantee in the Braves’ agreement with Cobb that the team will invest $400 million for the entertainment district. This could pose a problem. Early visions for other mixed-use projects near sports venues have proved to be too optimistic. The proposal for Brooklyn’s Barclays Center included 4.4 million square feet of residential property, 2.1 million square feet of commercial office space and 300,000 square feet in retail space, according to a 2003 news release posted on a watchdog blog devoted to the stadium project. Developers originally said it would take 10 years to build. The state has since agreed to give them decades more to finish the project. Construction has begun on only one of the apartment towers. On the other hand, there’s San Diego. In the 1990s, the Padres’ owner guaranteed $487 million in new real estate development for the struggling neighborhood surrounding the team’s planned ballpark. It would include features specified by the city. A 2012 study found that the number of higher-income residents has increased and real estate values were more stable than those in other intown neighborhoods. But the Padres’ impact on downtown San Diego may be nothing like the Braves’ impact on Cobb. As we mentioned previously, the Braves’ investment is not guaranteed. And the Padres invested in downtown development as inner-city neighborhoods across the country are revitalizing. The Braves’ planned development does not have this advantage. Another strike against Revitalize Cobb’s claim is that even if the Braves do invest $400 million into a development, the property’s tax value may not equal that amount. The value for tax purposes could be higher or lower, depending on sales values, rents and other factors. And if the Braves build it, will they come? Game attendance might tank if the team falters. Stadium goers might pass up the entertainment district’s restaurants if they fill up on hot dogs and beer inside the stadium, said Lake Forest College professor Robert Baade, an expert on the economics of sports. What’s worse, even the Braves’ most die-hard fans might think a condo by the stadium is not their idea of Home Sweet Home. ""People do not want to deal with drunken louts on game day and people walking on their lawn. Or doing worse on their lawn,"" Baade said. In sum, Revitalize Cobb’s statement is accurate but leaves out loads of important details that would give a reader a different impression if known. The projected $3 million increase for schools is difficult to predict and depends on many factors all lining up. The tax increase angle is more clear-cut. A homeowner’s overall 2019 property tax rate may be the same as it is now. But a reasonable person may consider the Braves deal a tax increase over the amount he or she would have paid if the team had stayed in downtown Atlanta. By PolitiFact’s definition, this amounts to a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC891D40>],/factchecks/2013/dec/16/revitalize-cobb/pro-stadium-group-paints-incomplete-picture/

Gun supporter says few prosecutions show that background checks don't work
","Fox News Sunday used the one-year anniversary of the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., to renew the gun debate. Carlee Soto, the sister of Newtown victim and Sandy Hook Elementary School teacher Victoria Soto, and Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, both advocated for a failed Senate bill that would expand background checks on gun purchases. Larry Pratt, the executive director of Gun Owners of America, countered by calling for more guns in schools. He also dismissed the Senate legislation. ""The background check is futile,"" Pratt said. ""Something like 42 (people during the) last year … were prosecuted for trying to buy a gun with a criminal record out of 11 million."" This talking point came up quite a bit in the months after the Sandy Hook shooting. The numbers aren’t far off, but they also doesn’t get at the heart of what a background check accomplishes. If 42 people out of 11 million were the only ones deterred from legally buying a gun because of a background check, then maybe ""futile"" would be an accurate description. After all, that’s only 1 in every 262,000 applications. But before we get into the other elements of a background check, let’s get the numbers right. Since the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 went into effect, federally licensed firearms dealers and state and federal authorities have used the FBI background check system to determine whether an individual can legally purchase a firearm. Pratt’s claim that 11 million background checks were conducted during the last year of record is a high estimate, but not by much. According to the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics, it’s actually around 10.4 million in 2010, the latest year on file. He’s also not far off on the number of prosecutions. A report by the Regional Justice Information Service ""Enforcement of the Brady Act, 2010,"" showed 62 charges were filed by U.S. attorneys across the country in response to background checks. Of those charges, 18 were dropped, putting the tally at 44, a couple more than Pratt’s number. However, that doesn’t include local charges in states that conduct their own checks. As PolitiFact noted earlier this year while conducting a similar fact-check on comments from Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., that’s likely to increase the total number of prosecutions. In his research, Ronald Frandsen, grants administrator for the Regional Justice Information Service, found that in the four states that voluntarily report local cases — Colorado, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia — 1,520 arrests were noted. Another 17 states that conduct background checks themselves were not included. ""You’d have to say (the total number of arrests) would be higher,"" Frandsen told PolitiFact at the time. ""There’s no question."" Pratt is also ignoring all the individuals who were denied weapons up front because they could not pass a background check. In 2010, 153,000 applications to purchase a firearm or obtain a permit were blocked. The most common reason an application is denied is because the customer has a previous felony conviction or indictment, making up almost half of all denials for federal checks and one-third of state checks. It’s still a small percentage of all the applications processed, about 1.5 percent, but it’s much more than Pratt lets one believe. Our ruling Pratt said ""the background check is futile. Something like 42 (people during the) last year of record were prosecuted for trying to buy a gun with a criminal record out of 11 million."" He is a little off in his numbers, but they’re close. However, his statement also paints just a partial picture of the entire background check procedure and how authorities and gun sellers use it to keep criminals from purchasing weapons. To make a bold claim like the system is ""futile"" and then leave out the thousands of individuals denied a firearm because of a background check is misleading.

Newt Gingrich says poverty problems are tied to Democrats
","A New York Times investigation detailing the plight of more than 22,000 homeless children in New York City prompted a fierce discussion about poverty in the United States on ABC’s This Week -- and specifically who’s to blame. Robert Reich, a Democrat and former Labor Department secretary, said Republicans shoulder responsibility for blocking legislation supported by Democrats and President Barack Obama. ""Baloney,"" responded former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. ""Every major city which has a center of poverty is run by Democrats,"" Gingrich said. ""Every major city."" We can’t easily assess whether Democrats or Republicans are to blame for poverty in U.S. cities, but we can analyze the basic statistics to see if Gingrich's point was correct. (Gingrich did not respond to us.) To measure the accuracy of Gingrich’s comment, we isolated the largest 50 U.S. cities using 2012 U.S. Census Bureau data. We then calculated the percentage of people in each city who are living below the federal poverty line, thanks to this Governing magazine report that relied on Census Bureau data. From there, we created a list of the 20 biggest U.S. cities with the largest percentage of people living below the federal poverty level (about $11,500 for one person). And finally, we researched the political party of the mayor in each city. Comparing poverty rates and political affiliation in large U.S. cities As you can see, out of the top 5 poorest major cities, two are led by Republicans -- Miami and Fresno, Calif. When we expand that to the top 20, we find three Republican mayors. For the record, New York -- which prompted the discussion -- ranked 25th out of the top 50 cities. Current New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has served as both a Republican and an independent. University of Michigan population studies professor Sheldon Danziger suggested analyzing state poverty levels and matching those with governors’ political ties would be more accurate than honing in on cities. Like we said at the outset, we’re staying away from drawing conclusions about poverty in U.S. cities and the political affiliation of their elected leader. We’re simply analyzing the statistics behind Gingrich’s comment. Our ruling Gingrich emphasized that every major, poor U.S. city is run by Democrats. We found two cities in the top 5 poorest, and three in the top 20, that have Republicans at the helm. Yes, most cities on the list are led by Democrats, but Gingrich said ""every.""

Under Obamacare, health insurance premiums haven't gone down, they've gone up, Ron Johnson says
","When it comes to statistics, chart-loving U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson seems like the guy who tries to get his comb-over just-so before he goes out for the evening. Meticulous. But the Wisconsin Republican wasn’t pointing to any charts (that we could see) on Dec. 5, 2013 when he did a Fox News Radio interview about one of the federal laws he most likes to skewer: The Affordable Care Act. ""It’s not affordable,"" Johnson stated on ""Kilmeade and Friends"" before making this claim about health insurance premiums. ""An average (annual) plan for a family didn't go down by $2,500, it's gone up about $2,500."" So, Johnson is saying that premiums are $2,500 more in 2013 than when Obamacare became law in 2010, and linkin the law to the increase. Let’s give the senator’s claim a fine-tooth examination. Down $2,500 When Johnson said premiums didn’t go down, he was referring to a promise made by candidate Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign. Obama pledged to sign a health care bill into law that would ""cut the cost of a typical family's premium by up to $2,500 a year.""   PolitiFact National rated that a Promise Broken. Now let's see what happened to premiums. Up $2,500 In saying the annual premium has gone up $2,500, Johnson’s office cited figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy research group. More specifically, we’re looking at the size of the premium for an employer-sponsored family plan -- that is, the total premium paid by the employer and the employee. About 60 percent of Americans under the age of 65 get their health insurance from their employer. Here are the national averages from Kaiser for the past 10 years. Year Annual family health insurance premium  Percentage increase 2004 $9,950 -- 2005 $10,880 9.34 2006 $11,480 5.51 2007 $12,106 5.45 2008 $12,680 4.74 2009 $13,375 5.48 2010 $13,770 2.95 2011 $15,073 9.46 2012 $15,745 4.46 2013 $16,351 3.85 
(Note: Kaiser says that based on the way its survey of employers is done, it rounds when referring to percentages. For example, Kaiser would say the increase from 2004 to 2005 was 9 percent.) So, as Johnson indicated, the average annual premium was $2,581 higher in 2013 than when the Affordable Care Act was adopted in 2010. But premiums rose each year before Obamacare, too. Why up $2,500? Johnson policy advisor Patrick McIlheran told us the senator was merely observing in the radio interview that premiums had risen in spite of Obama's promise. But implicit in Johnsons' claim is that Obamacare, to some extent, is responsible. The Kaiser figures show a premium increase of 9 percent in 2011, about a year after the health reform law was adopted. But one could argue that the longer the law has been in effect, the lower the premium increases have been (under 5 percent in 2012 and under 4 percent in 2013). Experts say, however, that a number of factors -- including the recession and the sluggish economic recovery -- affect premiums. Moreover, there is no consensus that enough time has passed to determine what effect the Affordable Care Act -- much of which doesn’t even take effect until 2014 -- has had on premiums, particularly for employer-sponsored plans. The president’s Council on Economic Advisers, in a November 2013 report, argues there is a connection between the law and a slowdown in health care costs overall. But the report also notes ""the causes of the slowdown are not yet fully understood."" Health economist Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, told us increases in premiums have slowed, ""but I’m one of those people who thinks that has nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act."" And when The Fact Checker, Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post, did a factcheck in September 2013 about Obamacare and premiums, he said the law’s impact ""is just now being calculated, adding: ""Trust us -- no one really knows yet."" So, whether Obamacare has helped raise, or kept a lid, on premiums remains largely unknown. Our rating Johnson said that under Obama’s health-care law, the premium for ""an average plan for a family didn't go down by $2,500 per year, it's gone up about $2,500 per year."" Johnson is correct that by 2013, three years after the Affordable Care Act became law, the total average premium for employer-provided family insurance had risen by $2,500 per year. But experts say there is little or no evidence that Obamacare is responsible. We rate Johnson’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBED4F40>],/factchecks/2013/dec/15/ron-johnson/obamacare-health-insurance-premiums-havent-gone-do/
"['Rhode Island', 'Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Guns', 'Michael Chippendale']","
Rhode Island Rep. Michael Chippendale says most crimes involving guns are committed by people who don't legally own that gun
","The adage, ""If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns,"" has been around at least since the 1980s. During an appearance on WPRO's Matt Allen show, state Rep. Michael Chippendale, a Republican from Foster, made a similar point when talking about gun owners and the fact that it is illegal in Rhode Island for state government to maintain a gun registry. ""I think if we were to analyze all police records, we'd find that crimes that occur with a firearm are not perpetrated by lawful firearm owners,"" he said. ""I would say the vast, overwhelming majority of them are committed by people who don’t legally possess that firearm in the first place. So they wouldn't show up on any sort of a register because they didn't obtain it legally. There's a strong argument that is supported by data, a lot of data, to support that point."" It seems reasonable that most criminals probably wouldn’t go through legal channels to get the weapon they use in a crime, but we were interested in determining whether that was true for the overwhelming majority of cases. So we asked Chippendale about the data. He emailed us to say his data disappeared when his computer died about a month ago. But he said an analysis of crimes in Providence in 2012 by a firearms advocacy group showed that, as he remembered it, among 110 or so actual arrests in which a firearm was seized, the weapon was returned to the owner in fewer than 10 instances. Those, of course, would be the legal owners. When we asked him for hard evidence, he sent us several Internet links, none of which directly addressed the question. It turns out, despite Chippendale’s assertion, there's not a lot of data to support his point. In Rhode Island, we checked with the attorney general's office, Providence's commissioner of public safety, and the Superior Court, which has its own gun court. None collect data in a form that would allow easy analysis of the question. The commissioner, Steven Pare, expressed surprise that any of the guns seized in 2012 would have been returned. ""It's rare that we return a gun that's been seized"" unless it's returned to someone who reported it stolen, he said. Nationally, we checked with some firearm groups and academics who study gun violence. None who responded had statistics that addressed the issue. ""You're probably not going to find direct evidence of the statement, since law enforcement agencies don't generally check specifically for legal possession, and certainly don't keep any centralized data that can be used to assess the claim,"" said David M. Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities and the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. Nonetheless, Kennedy said Chippendale’s statement ""is absolutely true. The overwhelming majority of gun crime is committed by chronic offenders who are legally prohibited from owning firearms; they have felony records or domestic violence misdemeanors, which are disqualifying under federal law. So by definition they can't own guns legally.""   We did, however, manage to find two sources of hard data. In 1997, the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics surveyed more than 203,000 prisoners. Among state prison inmates, only 14 percent reported getting their weapon from a retail outlet such as a store, pawn shop, flea market or gun show. An additional 13 percent said they had purchased it or obtained it in trade from a family member or friend, which wouldn't necessarily make them legal owners, especially in states like Rhode Island that require a background check with a private sale. Overall, the study found, no more than one quarter were legal owners of their weapons, assuming the inmates interviewed were telling the truth about whether their firearm acquisition was legal. The other source is a December 2012 study that looked at handgun-tracing data for firearms recovered by the police between 2003 and 2006, as logged through the California Dealer Record of Sale system, which tracks sales of firearms beyond the initial dealer. The team led by Glenn Pierce of Northeastern University, in Boston, found that in 31 percent of the cases, the gun belonged to the people who were found with them. In fewer than half the cases -- 47 percent -- the last recorded owners and the people who possessed the guns were different. In 22 percent of the cases, there was not enough information to make a determination. Pierce cautioned that some of these 10,273 confiscations don't include the types of gun-related crimes that Chippendale was talking about. For example, they include cases in which guns happened to be recovered during routine traffic stops. If those are taken out, he said, ""my guess is there would be the same or even fewer legally owned guns."" Our ruling Rep. Michael Chippendale said: ""The vast overwhelming majority of [crimes that occur with a firearm] are committed by people who don’t legally possess that firearm in the first place."" Chippendale was wrong when he said there was ""a lot of data"" to back his claim. We found very little. The few studies we did find suggested that at least a majority of perpetrators of gun crimes don’t legally possess the guns they used. And the experts we talked with generally backed that up. Allowing for some hyperbole on Chippendale's part, and given all of the uncertainties in the data, we rate his statement Mostly True.
