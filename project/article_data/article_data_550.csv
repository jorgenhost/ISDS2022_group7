Mika Brzezinski repeats myth that Super Bowl Sunday has 'highest rate of domestic violence'
","Two decades ago, a group of women’s rights advocates came out with a disturbing warning about professional football’s biggest day: Super Bowl Sunday is also the biggest day of the year for violence against women. The claim at a Pasadena, Calif., press conference ahead of the 1993 Super Bowl was backed by groups such as the California Women’s Law Center and Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, setting off a raft of fearful news headlines and airtime on Good Morning America. It wasn’t until a Washington Post reporter interviewed experts about the claim that the truth emerged: The claim was bogus. Even the Old Dominion University researchers whose work was cited as support for the connection said it was wrong. But by then it was too late to correct the record. The claim has found new life amid cable news coverage of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice and Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson. Morning Joe host Mika Brzezinski used it to support her argument that there is a connection between violence at home and aggressive play on the football field on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. ""You look at Super Bowl Sunday. Super Bowl Sunday has the highest rate of domestic violence,"" she said Sept. 16. ""There’s something about the game!"" Minutes later, she said, ""This is a violent game. And domestic violence on Super Bowl Sunday. We've seen the numbers. Why is that?"" The truth is that Super Bowl Sunday is not a unique day for domestic violence, says Callie Rennison, a University of Colorado Denver public affairs professor who studies domestic violence. ""This is not to be confused with there being no violence or a lower amount of violence on Super Bowl Sunday,"" Rennison said. ""It happens on holidays, it happens on weekends, and it happens on weekdays."" Rennison sent us a 2007 study published in Human Organization, the journal of the Society for Applied Anthropology, which concluded that the belief that domestic violence crisis calls increase during drink holidays in general, including the Super Bowl, is unsubstantiated. Press coverage of the original news conference 20 years ago said a California Women’s Law Center official cited research to bolster her comments. The lawyer, Sheila Kuehl, was reported as citing an academic study that found a 40 percent uptick in police reports of beatings and hospital admissions after Washington Redskins victories between 1988-89. But ""that’s not what we found at all,"" Janet Katz, the Old Dominion University criminology professor who worked on the study, told the Washington Post. Katz said her ""tentative findings"" did not correlate an increase in ER admissions of women with football games in general or with men upset by a team loss. A spokeswoman for MSNBC did not offer comment by deadline. Our ruling Brzezinski invoked a widely debunked claim that Super Bowl Sunday has the highest rate of domestic violence on Morning Joe. It’s no more true now than 20 years ago. Experts say this myth persists in spite of long-lasting academic rebuke. We rate it Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC75CBC0>],/factchecks/2014/sep/18/mika-brzezinski/mika-brzezinski-repeats-myth-super-bowl-sunday-has/

Media Matters says Fox gives GOP senators twice as much air time in ISIS hearing
","The president’s request to arm some Syrian rebels and conduct an air campaign against the forces of the Islamic State, a group also known as ISIS or ISIL, has found bipartisan support in Congress. But the liberal media analysis group Media Matters says the partisan divide is alive and well on Fox News. At least in terms of minutes of air time. In a blog post Sept. 16, the group charged that Fox News gave Republican senators twice as much time as Democrats during live coverage of the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on U.S. policy in Syria and Iraq. There were only two people giving testimony, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Martin Dempsey. Fox News ""aired more than 16 minutes of GOP questions, while showing less than eight minutes of Democratic questioning,"" the Media Matters post said. We decided to check their math, and compare Fox News to MSNBC and CNN, the two other cable news channels that carried the hearing. We used the subscription-based service Critical Mention to review coverage minute by minute on all three networks. Here’s what we found:  The Media Matters reporter added up the minutes correctly. Fox News provided 16 minutes of Republican questioning, compared to eight minutes of Democratic questioning. The other networks provided more of the raw feed of the hearing than did Fox News, thus more balance. CNN and MSNBC included the opening statements from the chair Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and the vice-chair Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., and questions from more senators from both parties. We counted each senator’s time based on the period when he or she had control of the microphone, not based on how long their lips were moving. The length of their questions had no effect on the tally. We rounded to the closest minute mark so the one-minute differences in the MSNBC and CNN coverage might not reveal very much. CNN had about a 90-second technical glitch that cut out about a minute of Inhofe’s time. Only MSNBC offered continuous coverage, although not from start to finish. The full hearing lasted almost four hours. Both Fox News and CNN pulled away at some point and rejoined the hearing in progress. Fox News rejoined to air questions from South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. CNN cut away twice, rejoining once for questions from Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, and again to carry Graham’s question session. Our ruling Media Matters said that Fox News gave Republican senators twice as much air time as Democratic ones during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. They said Republicans got 16 minutes compared to the Democrats’ eight. That matches our count. We also found that other networks provided more time and more evenly divided time to members of both parties. We rate the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4E8A48F40>],/factchecks/2014/sep/18/media-matters/media-matters-says-fox-gives-gop-senators-twice-mu/

Are three detainees swapped for Bowe Bergdahl now ISIS leaders?
","A reader recently sent us a link to a rather startling claim -- that three of the five Guantanamo detainees released by the United States in late May in exchange for Taliban prisoner Bowe Bergdahl have now taken up arms for the Islamic State. That’s the militant group sometimes known as ISIS or ISIL that has taken control of portions of Iraq and Syria and has beheaded two American journalists and at least one other Westerner. The claim stems from a website, politicalears.com, that ran a post on Sept. 15, 2014, with the headline, ""Three of five detainees swapped are now ISIS leaders."" The post, which was also linked to elsewhere on the Internet, goes on to say: ""It is being reported that at least 3 of the 5 detainees involved in the swap have joined ISIS in Syria and Iraq as commanders and are using that rank to usher in an 'Islamic Caliphate' (a Sunni Islamic Theocracy -- contrary to Obama's claims that ISIS is not Islamic). ""The 'Taliban 5' who were transferred from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to custody in Doha, Qatar, are Mohammad Fazl, Khairullah Khairkhwa, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Norullah Noori, and Mohammad Nabi Omari. They have largely disappeared from view since they were dropped off in Doha, but eyewitnesses place Fazi, Wasiq, and Noori in Iraq and Syria fighting with ISIS."" If true, this would be a major story. But it’s not. President Barack Obama took significant heat at the time for releasing the five detainees, with some critics also taking issue with the ex-detainees’ new terms of custody -- being transferred to the Persian Gulf state of Qatar with restrictions on their political behavior but relative freedom of movement within the country. We didn’t find any news reports about what the ex-detainees have been up to recently, but we quickly noticed a couple of red flags that made us suspicious of the email’s claims. For starters, the claim in politicalears.com is entirely unsourced. In addition, we’d run into politicalears.com before and found the site less than credible. Earlier this month, we looked at its claim that ""over 73 percent of all donations raised"" from the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge ""are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations."" We gave it a Pants on Fire. Experts who study the region told us the claim was wrong. The ex-detainees ""are all in Qatar. This is nonsense,"" said Barnett R. Rubin, director and senior fellow at New York University’s Center on International Cooperation. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that while he doesn’t doubt that the ex-detainees are dangerous to United States interests, ""there is literally zero evidence"" that the detainees have been spotted on the battlefield with ISIS. Gartenstein-Ross added that the claim doesn’t even make much logical sense and betrays the author’s weak grasp on the region’s nuances. ""The ex-detainees ""were in the Afghanistan-Pakistan theater,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. ""Based on these guys’ social networks and who their points of contact were, it’s pretty unlikely they’d be able to quickly find a way to the battlefield and have a command"" in the Iraq-Syria border region. ""They are not native Arabic speakers, and it would be unfamiliar terrain culturally. They would face a lot of obstacles,"" he said. When we asked the White House if there was any evidence that one or more detainees has joined ISIS, spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said, ""There is no truth to these reports."" Our ruling Bloggers said that ""three of five detainees swapped (for Bowe Bergdahl) are now ISIS leaders."" The claim has nonexistent sourcing, has been published by sites with questionable track records for accuracy, and has been knocked down by independent experts.

To justify ISIS airstrikes, Obama using legislation he wants repealed
","On Monday night, Jon Stewart took aim at President Barack Obama’s strategy to take down the Islamic State, highlighting the Obama administration’s mixed messages about whether or not their airstrikes were ""sustained counterterrorism activities"" or ""war."" ""There are legal ramifications to this,"" Stewart said. ""How we define the conflict will inform who has the authority to address the threat from ISIS-ISIL."" Stewart then played a clip where Fox News’ John Roberts explains that ""the president is relying on the Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMF) that President (George W.) Bush had signed in 2001 and 2002."" After a ditty about Middle Eastern wars, Stewart played a clip where Obama said he ""look(s) forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF’s mandate."" ""Wow, then you are lucky that Congress never does anything you ask, because otherwise you would be screwed right now,"" Stewart joked. This isn’t the first time Obama’s gotten flak on this: Associated Press reporter Julie Pace recently asked White House press secretary Josh Earnest about the ""irony in using as your legal justification for these airstrikes an authorization for military force that the President himself has called for repeal of."" So we wanted to check: Is Obama justifying his airstrikes using the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, while arguing that he wants the same AUMF repealed? When can the president wage war? Under the War Powers Act of 1973, the president has the power to wage war for 60 days before an AUMF or a declaration of war is needed from Congress. Obama authorized airstrikes in Iraq against ISIS on Aug. 7, so to carry out what Obama called a ""sustained counter-terrorism strategy"" against the Islamic State, he will need some sort of legislation from Congress. That’s what Bush did in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Congress passed an AUMF that gave the Bush the power to use ""appropriate force"" against anybody behind the attacks. That’s been understood to mean al-Qaida, and while the Islamic State used to be part of al-Qaida, they’ve since split over ideological differences and spats over leadership. Congress passed another AUMF in 2002 authorizing the Iraq War. But in his Sept. 10 speech about the Islamic State, Obama said, ""I have the authority to address the threat from ISIL,"" meaning he believes that attacking ISIS is permitted under an existing AUMF, either from 2001 or 2002. Obama made a similar statement during a Sept. 7 Meet the Press interview, but in neither case has Obama explicitly said that he’s using the 2001 or 2002 AUMF to justify his actions. Others in the White House have been more clear Others in his administration, though, have named the 2001 AUMF specifically. When Pace drilled Earnest on ""an AUMF he (Obama) wanted repealed,"" Earnest responded by calling it ""an AUMF that he (Obama) believes continues to apply to this terrorist organization that is operating in Iraq and Syria."" Various sources, included The New York Times and Time, have quoted a statement from a senior administration official provided to the media that specifically points to the 2001 AUMF as a justification for the U.S. airstrikes against ISIL. Even though al-Qaida and the Islamic State have formally split, the administration’s statement cites the group’s ""long history of conducting … attacks against U.S. persons and interests, the extensive history of U.S. combat operations against ISIL … and ISIL’s position … that it is the true inheritor of Osama bin Laden’s legacy"" as reasons why the 2001 AUMF applies. So although Obama himself hasn’t publicly named the 2001 AUMF, others in his administration have made it clear that he considers the legal justification for his airstrikes on the Islamic State. Missing context on Obama’s 'repeal' statement All that said, there’s no question that Obama said that he wanted the 2001 AUMF repealed. In a May 23, 2013, speech at the National Defense University -- from which Stewart got his clip -- Obama said that he looked ""forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF’s mandate."" Earlier, he notes that ""the AUMF is now nearly 12 years old,"" so it’s clear that he’s referring to the 2001 AUMF. Honing in on the ""repeal,"" though, oversimplifies Obama’s position. Pace’s formulation -- that Obama ""has called for repeal of"" the AUMF and that it's an ""AUMF he wants repealed"" -- implies that Obama wants the AUMF repealed immediately. That’s not the case. In the statement Pace was referring to, Obama said he wanted ""to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF’s mandate."" So refining comes first, and repeal is somewhere down the road. Clarifying the timeline In fact, in the same speech, Obama mentioned his administration’s campaign against al-Qaida in the Arab Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen, which his administration has justified using the 2001 AUMF. About a year after Obama’s 2013 statements about the AUMF, a senior administration official (unnamed in the White House transcript) put a more specific timeline on refining and repealing the AUMF. The Obama administration, said the official, will ""want to talk to Congress about the AUMF as we approach the end of the year (2014)."" And on Sept. 12, Earnest said that there had been ""conversations between senior White House staffers and members of Congress"" in response to a question about ""revising, refining, or repealing the 2001 AUMF."" There’s actually been more than just conversations: Since Obama’s 2013 speech, the House of Representatives has voted against two separate amendments from Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., that would have repealed the 2001 AUMF. But as far as we can tell, the Obama administration didn’t comment on those amendments. So repeal may be somewhere down the line, and the Obama administration has consistently stated they plan to change the 2001 AUMF, but saying Obama wants the 2001 AUMF repealed is an a bit of a simplification. Our ruling Pace said that the Obama administration is using as its ""legal justification for these airstrikes (on the Islamic State), an authorization for military force that the president himself has called for repeal of,"" and several other publications have reiterated her point that Obama wanted the 2001 AUMF Pace is referring to repealed. There’s no doubt that the Obama administration is using the 2001 AUMF as its ""legal justification."" Obama hasn’t publicly named the 2001 AUMF, but his press secretary and a statement from a senior administration official have. Saying that Obama ""called for repeal of"" the 2001 AUMF, though, is an oversimplification. Obama said he wanted to work with Congress ""to refine and, ultimately, repeal"" the 2001 AUMF, meaning he wants it repealed eventually, but not now. Other statements by his administration have been consistent with that point of view. Pace’s statement could have used some additional clarification or detail, so we rate her claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC653680>],/factchecks/2014/sep/18/julie-pace/justify-airstrikes-against-islamic-state-obama-usi/

Did Rick Scott close 30 women's health care centers'?
","Democrats have been counting on a gender gap to win races in 2014, and Democrat Charlie Crist is part of that trend, lobbying hard for the women’s vote in his battle against Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Crist has been endorsed by Planned Parenthood PAC (despite his own mixed record on abortion in the past), has vowed to push for equal pay for women and now is attacking Scott’s record on funding rape crisis centers. Crist has also enlisted endorsements from Democratic women, such as U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach. Frankel recently penned a campaign fundraising email attacking Scott that was emailed out by the Crist campaign. ""If Rick Scott wins, the next four years are going to be rough for Floridians,"" Frankel said in an email on Sept. 12, adding, ""Recently he closed 30 women's health care centers across the state."" This claim warranted a thorough check-up from the Truth-O-Meter -- and we quickly diagnosed the heart of the problem in Frankel’s words. Women’s health care centers We reached out to both Frankel and the Crist campaign. Neither could provide evidence for closed health care centers. The Crist campaign admitted the statement was an error. ""That should have read ‘He cut funding to 30 rape crisis centers across the state,’ "" Crist campaign spokesman Brendan Gilfillan said. Frankel's spokeswoman Majda Sarkic sent us this response: ""The issue here is not about email wording. It is about Rick Scott denying Florida women and more specifically victims of sexual violence the healthcare they need and deserve."" So the statement that Scott closed 30 women’s health centers is completely wrong. We decided to then look at what happened to funding for rape crisis centers under Scott. The state funds rape crisis centers through various pots of money. A portion comes from the Rape Crisis Trust Fund, which comes from fines assessed on felony criminal defendants. Since not all of the defendants pay what they owe, advocates have sought an additional stream of dollars from the Legislature. For several years, programs have shared a recurring amount from the Attorney General’s Office and in some years the Legislature and governor approved additional money. Based on our interviews with women’s advocates and state officials, here is the amount of state dollars that went to rape crisis centers statewide: Legislative session Money from state AG (usually from general revenue) Other general revenue Trust Fund** 2007-Crist $400,000 0 $1.5 million 2008-Crist $400,000* 0 $2 million 2009-Crist $250,000 0 $2 million 2010-Crist $250,000 0 $1.8 million 2011-Scott $250,000 0 $1.8 million 2012-Scott $500,000 0 after Scott vetoed $1.5 million approved by Legislature $1.4 million 2013-Scott $500,000 $2.5 million $1.3 million 2014-Scott $500,000 $2.5 million $1.3 million So why did Scott veto $1.5 million in 2012 but then approve $2.5 million in 2013 and again in 2014? In 2012, Scott’s veto during Sexual Assault Awareness Month drew some scrutiny. The Huffington Post quoted Scott’s spokesman at the time, Lane Wright. ""This new funding of $1.5 million would have been duplicative, since, as a state, we already fund sexual violence programs,"" Wright said. ""There was no information suggesting any needs in this area weren’t already being met."" Representatives of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence met with state staff after the veto, said Jennifer Dritt, the nonprofit group’s executive director. ""There were a number of people in the Legislature who spoke with the governor’s office about the need, and in 2013, there it was in his recommended budget,"" Dritt said. ""We were never in any governor’s recommendation for funding until Gov. Scott recommended $2.5 million in 2013."" A spokesman for Scott’s campaign cited a 2013 statement by Dritt praising Scott’s recommendation for $2.5 million. ""This appropriation will make a world of difference in the lives of Florida’s citizens, and we’re grateful for his commitment,"" Dritt said. The increase in money has allowed some centers to hire additional staff which helped reduce waiting lists and expand services. For example, the Nancy J. Cotterman center in Broward used the $255,000 in new money over two years to hire a full-time crisis intervention specialist, part-time crisis intervention counselors and expand community outreach including to hospitals. Dritt said Scott’s veto did not cause any of the 30 rape crisis centers to close in 2012. Two centers have since lost certification and one chose to give it up while one new center was added, bringing the current total to 28. Our ruling In a fundraising email sent out by the Crist campaign, Frankel wrote that Scott ""closed 30 women’s health care centers around the state."" Crist’s campaign said that the email should have said that Scott cut money for rape crisis centers, but even that smaller claim isn’t accurate. More importantly, the statement that Scott closed 30 health centers is completely wrong. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD4B140>],/factchecks/2014/sep/18/lois-frankel/lois-frankel-says-rick-scott-closed-30-womens-heal/

Minimum wage means most 2-bedroom apartments are out of reach
","What kind of apartment can you afford on a minimum-wage salary?  Your options may be very limited.  ""There is no state in the U.S. where a 40-hour minimum wage work week is enough to afford a two-bedroom apartment,"" says a Facebook graphic posted Sept. 11 from OurTime.org, an advocacy group for young Americans. At PolitiFact, we’ve noticed a growing number of Facebook users sharing graphics generated by OurTime.org. Its following on Facebook has grown from 100,000 in February to half a million today, and readers are constantly asking us to verify the information the group posts in catchy shareables. The posts tend to highlight progressive issues, like income inequality and the cost of higher education. This particular post had just over 9,000 shares on Sept. 17. Given its reach — and the focus from Democrats on the minimum wage this election cycle — we wanted to give it a look. OurTime.org cited the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a group that advocates for policies that improve housing for the poor, as a source on the graphic. Each year, the National Low Income Housing Coalition publishes a report that calculates what they call the ""housing wage,"" or the hourly wage a full-time worker must earn to afford a decent two-bedroom rental home. The findings of the study are summed up in the introduction: ""The 2014 two-bedroom Housing Wage is $18.92. This national average is more than two-and-a-half times the federal minimum wage, and 52 percent higher than it was in 2000. In no state can a full-time minimum wage worker afford a one-bedroom or a two-bedroom rental unit at Fair Market Rent."" Four important words are included in the report that aren’t in the Facebook graphic: ""at Fair Market Rent."" That’s a critical distinction. What is Fair Market Rent? It’s an official number calculated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development that helps in determining subsidy levels for low-income renters. The department surveys rent prices in 530 metropolitan areas and 2,045 nonmetropolitan counties, and on a scale of all the rents being charged in a metro area, establishes a unique Fair Market Rent at the 40th percentile. This means that 40 percent of the rental properties in that area are at or below that threshold. So the Fair Market Rent is set just a bit below average rents in a given area. For example, in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metropolitan area of Florida, the Fair Market Rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $951. Sixty percent of two-bedroom apartments in the area are more expensive than this, but 40 percent of them are at or below $951. The federal government does not create a state-based average for Fair Market Rent, but the National Low Income Housing Coalition created one by weighting government data with U.S. Census data on rental populations. The Fair Market Rent of a two-bedroom apartment in Florida costs $1,008 a month, or $12,096 a year. How much would someone need to make to afford that? Get out your calculators and scratch paper because it takes some math. The standard used by the federal government is that housing shouldn’t cost more than 30 percent of an individual’s income. That leaves people with enough money for other necessities like food, transportation, a phone, etc. For low-income individuals and families, anything more than 30 percent is teetering on homelessness, said Megan Bolton, research director for the National Low Income Housing Coalition. So if someone is making the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, they can afford rent of $377 a month. Obviously, that’s a good bit less than Florida’s Fair Market Rent of $1,008 for a two-bedroom apartment. For a person to afford a two-bedroom apartment in Florida would require a gross income of $40,355, or $19.39 an hour. That’s well above the minimum wage in Florida of $7.93, which is actually set a touch higher than the federal minimum wage. This does not factor in any housing assistance an individual might receive through the federal government. The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s largest program assists 1.2 million households, a spokesman said. Of course, there are cheaper places to live than Florida. At $653 a month, Arkansas has the lowest Fair Market Rent for a two-bedroom apartment. Even at that price, it would take a wage of $12.56 an hour to afford the rent, according to the government’s definition. Let’s break it down further, though. According to the federal government, in rural Arkansas, the Fair Market Rent is $561. That would require an hourly wage of $10.79. Arkansas’ minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. What about states and cities that have much higher minimum wages than the federal standard? Washington state has a minimum wage of $9.32, and Seattle recently raised its to $15 an hour. But there, the Fair Market Rent of a two-bedroom apartment is higher and still outpaces the minimum wage, the study found. In most states, it would actually take the equivalent of two or more minimum wage salaries to afford a Fair Market Rent. The National Low Income Housing Coalition found this to be true of one-bedroom apartments, too. This isn’t to say that there aren’t apartments for much cheaper than the Fair Market Rate. At the 40th percentile, by definition, means 40 percent of rental properties in that area are at that price or cheaper — which is why it was important that the National Low Income Housing Coalition included that qualifier, and why it is somewhat misleading that OurTime.org did not. ""Absolutely, certainly there are places with rents at $377, especially if you’re in smaller areas, and they may be of okay quality,"" Bolton said. ""If a minimum wage earner can get an apartment at that price, it would be affordable for them."" However, cheaper might also have other tradeoffs, like being in an area with higher crime rates or low-performing schools, or it might just be a crummy apartment. Our ruling The Facebook graphic by OurTime.org claimed, ""There is no state in the U.S. where a 40-hour minimum wage work week is enough to afford a two-bedroom apartment."" The group left out a key distinction from the study they cite: Minimum wage workers can’t afford a two-bedroom apartment at Fair Market Rent, a number determined by the federal government for each region set at the 40th percentile of all rents in that area. That means that in some areas, minimum wage earners would be able to find and afford housing that is cheaper than the Fair Market Rent. Though, in states where rent is more expensive, minimum wage earners would not be able to afford apartments even well below the Fair Market Rent. The point is reasonably on target and applies to the vast majority of minimum wage workers looking for quality rental housing. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC770580>],/factchecks/2014/sep/18/facebook-posts/can-someone-afford-apartment-making-minimum-wage/

Trump: More than half of parents spank their kids
","The furor over Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson and his admission that he struck his 4-year-old son with a wooden switch has put parenting and corporal punishment in the spotlight. Peterson has said he grew up treated the same way by his parents. The Vikings pulled Peterson from the team’s active roster while his case moves through the courts. During a Sept. 17 broadcast on ESPN’s Mike and Mike, billionaire Donald Trump waded into the debate. While saying that he was never a ""spanker,"" which is less severe than Peterson’s offense, Trump said there’s no simple response because many parents physically discipline their kids and they turn out ""good."" ""It's a pretty tough thing because I saw something last night that much more than 50 percent of people out there and parents out there are spankers,"" Trump said. We thought it would be worthwhile to check if spanking is as common as Trump said. In large measure, the data says it is. A 2013 study by Columbia University researchers found that 57 percent of mothers and 40 percent of fathers engaged in spanking when children were age three, and 52 percent of mothers and 33 percent of fathers engaged in spanking at age five.   Disadvantaged families represented a large share of the survey group but the results are consistent with other studies. A 1999 article in Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review reported that 72 percent of parents of children between the ages of two and four said they sometimes spanked their kids. A 2002 poll commissioned by ABC News asked a random sample of adults if they had ever spanked their children. Over half of them said they had. That ABC survey showed an interesting regional difference. In the South, 62 percent of parents said they spank their children. For the rest of the country, the fraction dropped to 41 percent. We should note that pediatricians as a group strongly discourage spanking. They cite evidence that ties it to behavioral problems and lower school performance. The spanking label covers a lot of ground. Some parents hit harder and more often than others. To talk simply of spanking masks important differences in how parents treat their children. Our ruling Speaking about the Peterson case, Trump said that much more than 50 percent of parents are spankers. In this fact-check, we’re not judging whether spanking is akin to what Peterson did, we’re simply verifying Trump’s statistic. He’s close. We found two polls that put the fraction a bit over half, rather than ""much more."" But that aside, Trump is largely correct within a broad definition of spanking.

","With the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria growing in the Middle East, nearly half of Americans think the country is less safe than it was before Sept. 11, 2001, according to a recent poll. Some Republicans have expressed concern that the southern border is so porous, members of the extremist group could slip into the United States from Mexico. And a few have said such a plot is already in the works -- but federal agencies don’t agree. Rep. Trent Franks, a Republican from Arizona, said his state faces an imminent threat in a recent phone conference with conservative nonprofit Staying True to America’s National Destiny. BuzzFeed picked up Franks’ comment, and it made its way around the Internet. ""It is true, that we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez or they were within the last few weeks,"" Franks said. ""So there’s no question that they have designs on trying to come into Arizona. The comment that I’ve made is that if unaccompanied minors can cross the border then certainly trained terrorists probably can, too. It is something that is real."" Several other politicians have made similar claims, including Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. And the claims are spreading around conservative online media, like the Daily Caller, Breitbart News and pundit Sean Hannity at Fox News. This clashes with the federal government’s assertion that there is currently no credible threat that ISIS is planning an attack on United States soil. With Franks and so many others claiming that the threat is certain and looming, we decided to see whether or not their evidence is credible. Based on our talks with experts and statements from law enforcement officials, the possibility of ISIS attacking the U.S. by crossing the southern border seems unlikely. The certainty that Franks suggests about what we ""know"" is wrong. The origins In a statement to PolitiFact, Franks said he got the information from a report circulating around the Internet. Franks has since learned that Homeland Security believes the report was ""overstated,"" and his subsequent comments reflect that -- though he remains concerned about the possibility of terrorists crossing the border. The report is from Judicial Watch, a conservative media website, and it claims that ""Islamic terrorist groups are operating in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez and planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle borne improvised explosive devices,"" citing several anonymous ""high-level federal law enforcement, intelligence and other sources."" We couldn’t find any other media outlets that independently verified the story, and no federal officials would corroborate its claims, either. Without knowing anything about Judicial Watch’s sources -- such as rank or agency -- it’s hard for us to assess the article’s credibility. In an interview with PolitiFact, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton would not go into any further detail. The article says the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to their multiple requests. We asked Homeland Security about the threat in Juarez, and they said, ""There is no credible intelligence to suggest that there is an active plot by (ISIS) to attempt to cross the southern border."" The topic came up a few times in recent congressional hearings, and administrators reiterated the lacking evidence of an imminent threat. In a Sept. 10 hearing before the House Homeland Security Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee, Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., said, ""We know that terrorist networks have been using our porous southern border and a broken immigration system to enter the United States."" DHS Deputy Under Secretary for Analysis Jennifer Lasley responded. ""To date, we have not had credible reporting that either Hezbollah or any other terrorist group has been taking advantage of our borders to move individuals in and out,"" Lasley said. ""It's something we are always looking for, but to date, we have not seen credible evidence of that."" Later in the same hearing, Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, discussed his conversations with DHS, when administrators told him that there has never been evidence of terrorists entering the United States via the southern border. He posed the same question to DHS administrators present at the hearing. In response, John Wagner, acting assistant commissioner for Custom and Border Patrol’s Office of Field Operations, said it is much more likely that ISIS and other Islamic extremists would come to the United States by commercial plane. Wagner said the number of people suspected in terrorist activity caught on the southern border is in the tens, while those on commercial jets is in the thousands. Both Rep. Franks and Fitton of Judicial Watch mentioned to us that the government has intercepted ISIS social media posts that indicated a potential attack carried out by crossing the border. This came up in a Sept. 10 Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., asked Undersecretary for Intelligence and Analysis Francis Taylor about recent reports of Twitter and Facebook exchanges in which ISIS ""urged infiltration"" across the U.S.-Mexico border. ""Yes, sir, there have been Twitter, social media exchanges among ISIL adherents across the globe speaking about that as a possibility,"" Taylor said, adding: ""I'm satisfied that we have the intelligence and the capability at our border that would prevent that activity."" This admission energized the discussions in the conservative media. But social media threats should be taken with a grain of salt, said Colin Clarke, an expert on international security at the Rand Corporation, a think tank. ""ISIS could say ‘we would never consider (crossing the border),’ and would we take that seriously?"" Clarke said. ""It’s really just one small sliver of evidence."" It’s possible, but unlikely We talked to several national security experts, and each one said they haven’t seen credible evidence that ISIS is staging a plot that involves crossing the southern border. They also said that scenario is highly unlikely. ""There is big difference between a theoretical risk or a risk that is worth worrying about,"" said David Schanzer, director of Duke University’s Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security. The general sentiment among experts was: It’s possible that ISIS could sneak through the border -- illegal immigrants do it every day. But why would they? Schanzer noted that ISIS members who have U.S. passports or visas could enter the country legally via plane. (The 9/11 hijackers had U.S. visas.) Whereas if they crossed the border illegally, they would run the risk of getting caught. Another possibility is that someone living in the United States could become radicalized over the Internet and then stage an attack, like the men who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings last year, Clarke said, adding that this was his biggest concern. Additionally, ISIS is ""overwhelmingly focused"" on Iraq and Syria, said Daniel Benjamin, former ambassador at large and coordinator for counterterrorism at the State Department. The group likely does not have the wherewithal to stage an attack on American soil at this point. In order to cross the border and stage an attack, ISIS would need a broad network in place in the United States that could provide them with intelligence, weapons, money, sanctuary, training and more, Clarke added. And this is not a new claim. In 2011, then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney (and several other Republican candidates) said the Islamic militant group Hezbollah was working in Mexico, and we rated that claim Mostly False. (We found some evidence of Hezbollah sympathizers working in South and Central America,but little evidence for the group ""working"" in Mexico.) In 2010, Judicial Watch published a story with the headline: ""Feds Warn Of Terrorists Sneaking Into U.S. Through Mexico."" O’Rourke, the Texas representative, has said that he came across an El Paso newspaper story from 1981 about Libyan terrorists in Juarez, though evidence of such a group was never found. Despite years of these claims, Schanzer said he is not aware of a ""single person arrested for a terrorism-related offense after crossing the border illegally."" We should note that in 2011, an Iranian plotted to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States, and his plan involved Mexican drug traffickers, according to the Washington Post. The man, who had previously lived in Texas, thought his contact in Mexico was a drug smuggler, when it was actually a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration informant. The man was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, where he flew from Mexico.  Our ruling Franks said, ""It is true that we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez."" We found that it is highly unlikely that ISIS would operate in Mexico and stage an attack that involves crossing the border. The claims originated in an article with unnamed sources, published by a right-wing outlet. We could not find one law enforcement official or another media outlet that independently verified or corroborated the claims. It’s a far stretch to say ""we know"" with certainty that ISIS is in Juarez, so we rate this claim Mostly False.

Steve Adler says 57 percent of Austin jobs added from 2009 to 2013 didn't pay a living wage
","Austin isn’t as affordable as it needs to be, mayoral aspirant Steve Adler says on his campaign website, adding: ""Our children cannot afford to live in the Austin where they grew up when they graduate and leave home. Even during a time of historic job growth, 57% of the jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage."" We wondered about that percentage. By email, Adler’s campaign manager, Jim Wick, said Adler saw the figure in an April 26, 2014, Austin American-Statesman news analysis by Dan Zehr citing data compiled by Idaho-based Economic Modeling Specialists International, which analyzes workforce-related data. That story said that while the Austin metro area had gained thousands of jobs in recent years, inflation-adjusted earnings had fallen. Then came the declaration that drew Adler’s attention, which didn’t speak generally to families or to jobs in Austin alone. ""From 2009 to 2013,"" the article said, ""almost 57 percent of the newly created jobs in the area paid less than the living wage for a single parent with one child ($19.56 per hour), according to data from EMSI and the oft-cited living wage calculator created by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."" That living-wage figure, identical for Travis and Williamson counties, appears on web pages overseen by Amy Glasmeier, an MIT professor of economic geography and regional planning.  According to the entries, the living wage is ""the hourly rate that an individual must earn to support their family, if they are the sole provider and are working full-time (2,080 hours per year)."" To our inquiry, Zehr provided a spreadsheet he built based on increases or decreases in jobs across more than 730 professions in the Austin-Round Rock Metropolitan Statistical Area, also showing the estimated median hourly wage for each of the professions. By email, EMSI spokesman Joshua Wright said its median hourly wage data came from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and that information was benchmarked to the firm’s own industry-by-industry data drawn from agencies like the BLS and U.S. Census Bureau. By our calculation, some 53,315 of the 92,620 net jobs added in the Austin area from 2009 to 2013, or 58 percent, had a median hourly wage less than the living wage for a single parent with one child. These lower-wage jobs encompassed 394 types of jobs including positions in oil, gas and mining as well as loan interviewers and clerks, pest control workers, skin-care specialists and medical secretaries, according to the spreadsheet. In reviewing these details, we also wondered if the outcomes for Austin workers were as dire as Adler said. For instance, the MIT website presents lower living wages including, for Travis and Williamson counties, $18.51 an hour for two adults and a child; $14.88 for two adults only; and $9.43 for one adult alone. If you focus on earnings at a lower living wage, in turn, you’re going to conclude more workers fared better. According to the spreadsheet, for instance, 40,560 of the 92,620 net jobs gained from 2009 to 2013, or 44 percent, had median hourly wages less than $14.88; 15,099 of the net jobs gained, 16 percent, had median hourly wages less than $9.43. It also occurred to us the median wage might not be a perfect way to gauge who exactly is earning enough to get by. That is, the median wage in each occupation is the boundary between the highest paid 50 percent and the lowest paid 50 percent of workers. It stands to reason, then, that some workers in the 57 percent still made more than the living wage for a single parent with a child. But it’s also so that some of the other 43 percent made less than the same living wage.  The limits of public wage data evidently make it difficult to calculate a precise percentage. Next, for an independent look at this claim, we turned to Cynthia Osborne, a University of Texas associate professor and director of the Child and Family Research Partnership at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. By email, Osborne told us the 57 percent figure might be right, but she’d need more information -- particularly the variations in wages around each median -- to reach a conclusion. EMSI’s Wright told us he didn’t have that type of information, but could share the wages for each occupation at specific points along the wage curve. Daniel Dillon, a research associate for the partnership, later said three interpolations drawing on this added detail basically confirmed about 57 percent of the jobs added in the Austin area didn’t pay the living wage for an adult with one child. Our ruling Adler said: ""57% of the jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage."" To be precise, that’s the estimated share of net jobs added in the multi-county Austin area (not Austin alone) pegged as having median wages less than the living wage for an adult with one child. Families vary in size, though, as do related living wages. We rate this statement, which lacks clarification, Mostly True.

Scott Walker says state 11th in business establishment growth under him vs. 47th under Mary Burke
","Following the searing recall elections and years of bare-knuckle brawling in Madison, it wouldn’t have surprised anyone to see Wisconsin’s 2014 campaign season start nasty and get nastier in the closing months. Instead, we have numerical warfare -- an arms race of rankings and comparisons on the economy before and after Scott Walker. Yeah. Here at PolitiFact, that’s just the way we like it. The Republican governor’s new ""Wisconsin’s Comeback"" plan -- a platform for his 2014 re-election bid -- includes a raft of rankings and statistics in its 62 pages (and 208 footnotes). Many of those rankings compare Walker’s time in state government with that of his Democratic challenger, Mary Burke. She was state Commerce Department secretary under Gov. Jim Doyle from early 2005 to late 2007. Among the comparisons: ""Since Governor Walker took office, Wisconsin ranks 11th in the nation in total business establishment growth compared to 47th in the years Mary Burke was Commerce secretary."" Walker has argued tax cuts and other moves have helped spur small business growth. But is he right on the rankings? Before the Great Recession hit, was Wisconsin a bottom feeder for business establishment growth, compared to a near Top-10 showing now? Defining terms First things first: Let’s define ""business establishment growth."" It’s not a reference to job growth, or even new business creation, so it doesn’t carry the weight those figures carry. The phrase is a bit of jargon courtesy of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that releases state-by-state data every quarter on employment-related measures. Contrary to what the phrase may suggest, it’s not about how many businesses have incorporated or otherwise formed, compared with how many have folded or otherwise died. Instead, ""business establishments"" means a business location, such as a new store or factory or farm. A single ""company"" can have multiple ""establishments,"" and new ""establishments"" can be opened by existing or new firms. The data comes from a very broad census of employers and economists use it as one indicator of net business activity. Walker cites the data as backup for the claim, and we agree it’s the right data to look at for his very specifically worded statement. Checking the rankings We started with Burke’s time at Commerce. Her tenure as the economic development chief coincides pretty well with the quarterly data collection, though it’s not perfectly aligned. She started in February 2005 and left in November 2007. We used the fourth quarter of 2004 as our starting point and the same quarter in 2007 as the end point. And we looked only at private-sector figures because both Walker and Burke have focused on economic growth in that sector. The numbers showed a ranking of 47, just as Walker claimed. (It was one lower if you use the first quarter of 2005 as the baseline as a nod to the fact that Burke arrived mid-quarter). The number of new establishments grew 1.3 percent in the three-year period from 2005 to 2007, ahead of only Michigan, Massachusetts and Maine. At the top of the heap were Arizona, Nevada and Florida, all with more than 14 percent growth. Illinois had the highest rank in the Midwest (11th). Walker compared Burke’s time at commerce to what happened since he took office. There is no data source we found that brings us to the present  -- or even close. That’s because there is a long lag in reporting the quarterly data. (Information for the first quarter of 2014 is scheduled to be released Sept. 18, 2014.) We looked at the most recent data, which covers 2011 through 2013, Walker’s first three years in office. In this period, Wisconsin’s growth rate (5.5 percent) was 11th highest, just behind Iowa (10th) and Illinois (9th). So Walker’s claim is on solid ground. To be sure, the ""establishment"" rankings don’t necessarily match up with separate ranking of net job gains in the state. During Walker’s first three years, for example, Wisconsin was 35th for private-sector job growth, but 11th in establishment growth. There’s a much stronger correlation during the Burke era -- the state ranked 42nd in private job gains from 2005-’07, and 47th in pace of new business ""establishments."" So what should we read into these ""establishment"" growth numbers? It’s important to keep in mind the statistics make no distinction between the size of the firms being created and shutting down, according to economist Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls. ""If you have a lot of firms with one to four employees being created, you can get a good ranking for the number of businesses being created, but a bad ranking for total employment growth,"" he said. Our rating Walker’s second-term blueprint said that since he took office, ""Wisconsin ranks 11th in the nation in total business establishment growth compared to 47th in the years Mary Burke was Commerce secretary."" The numbers, though not covering Walker’s complete time as governor, are the latest available and support Walker’s statement. We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC0285C0>],/factchecks/2014/sep/17/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-11th-business-establis/

Ad targeting Scott Brown says 'New Hampshire has lost more jobs to China than any other state'
","As Election Day draws nearer, the New Hampshire Senate race has grown in prominence nationally. With polls showing the contest between Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen and Republican challenger Scott Brown closer than ever, both candidates -- and their independent allies -- are airing hard-hitting attack ads, hoping a victory might sway control of the U.S. Senate. One ad released on Sept. 15, 2014, by the Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic-aligned independent group, takes aim at Brown for his alleged support for outsourcing jobs. Part of the ad piqued our interest: ""New Hampshire has lost more jobs to China than any other state,"" the narrator says. Accompanying the narration was a visual that said, ""NH has lost more jobs to China than any other state."" Given that New Hampshire ranks as only the 42nd biggest state in population, that claim sounded odd. So we decided to take a look. Senate Majority PAC did not respond to an inquiry, but we found the Union Leader article cited in the ad. It covered the publication of a study in 2012 by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal group based in Washington. It’s worth noting that the report’s authors cautioned that ""it is not a statistical survey of actual jobs gained or lost in individual companies, or the opening or closing of particular production facilities."" Rather, the group fed federal trade and employment data into a mathematical model to estimate how many jobs were displaced by trade with China between 2001 and 2011. So what did the study find? It found that New Hampshire ranked first among the 50 states in the estimated number jobs lost to China -- as a percentage of the state workforce. That’s similar to, but not the same as, the ad’s language. The ad talked about the number of jobs, not jobs as a percentage of the workforce. If you measure estimated job losses by the raw number instead of the percentage of the workforce, then New Hampshire, a relatively small state, falls far down the list. New Hampshire is tied for the 29th out of the 50 states on the list of estimated job losses. And on the list of congressional districts in the report, neither of New Hampshire’s two districts rank among the top 20 nationally for estimated job losses to China. We’ll close by noting that the Union Leader’s headline got it right, but the ad’s version of that headline dropped four key words at the end. The article said, ""NH has lost more jobs to China than any other state, 2.94% of total workforce."" Our ruling The Senate Majority PAC ad said that ""New Hampshire has lost more jobs to China than any other state."" First, the ad did not note that this was an estimate, rather than a hard number of actual jobs lost to China. Second, the estimate was that New Hampshire lost the biggest percentage of its workforce -- not most jobs -- to China. We have no quarrel with the use of workforce percentages as the yardstick for this comparison, since doing so makes it possible to fairly compare 50 states that have widely disparate numbers of residents. But the distinction between jobs and percentage of the workforce should have been reflected in the ad. Otherwise, it makes the ad’s claim seem more powerful than it is. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB9F09C0>],/factchecks/2014/sep/16/senate-majority-pac/ad-targeting-scott-brown-says-new-hampshire-has-lo/

CBS Sports' James Brown: 'More than 3 women per day' are killed by their partner
","Advocates for victims of domestic violence say the one good thing to come out of the Ray Rice scandal is more Americans are aware of just how big of a problem this is -- and it’s not limited to the NFL. CBS Sports announcer James Brown touched on this in a 90-second monologue directed to all men during the Sept. 11 pregame broadcast of Thursday Night Football, which coincidentally featured Rice’s former team, the Baltimore Ravens, against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Brown urged men to learn ""what healthy, respectful manhood is all about"" and to ""give help or to get help, because our silence is deafening and deadly."" Then he pulled out a stirring statistic. ""Consider this: According to domestic violence experts, more than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners,"" Brown said. ""That means that since the night Feb. 15 in Atlantic City (the night Ray Rice hit now-wife Janay Rice on the elevator) more than 600 women have died."" The figure is used across several outreach group websites, including Futures Without Violence, the Domestic Abuse Shelter of the Florida Keys, the National Network to End Domestic Violence and the Arkansas Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Experts say the claim is accurate. While the veracity of crime statistics in general can be questioned due to underreporting by victims and mislabeling by the investigating officer, murder statistics are reliable, experts say. The biggest repository for national crime statistics is the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report, which is based on data collected from local law enforcement agencies. Callie Rennison is a University of Colorado Denver public affairs professor who analyzes crime trends. Crunching federal figures, Rennison found 3.3 women died at the hands of their intimate partners per day in 2010. To get that figure, she divided the number of intimate partner homicides with female victims (1,192) by the number of days in the year. More than three days a day is alarmingly high, but it’s also down from a recent high of 4.2 deaths per day in 1993. Rennison did not run a similar calculation for the most recent years available, 2011 and 2012, but the trend holds. Of course, this is a daily average and not an exact representation of how many women are killed by their current or former partners. ""So strictly scientifically speaking, it is a risk to estimate how many people have been killed in domestic violence incidents since Feb. 15,"" said Mary Koss, University of Arizona public health professor. ""However, doing so is not fundamentally wrong and crime experts do it frequently."" Because the number of male victims in intimate partner homicides is much lower, so too is the daily average. There were 305 of these deaths in 2010, which amounts to a daily average of 0.84. James Fox, a Northeastern University criminology professor, sliced the data differently for his own count of intimate partner homicides. He factored in unsolved homicide cases believed to have involved intimate partners. The result: slightly higher deaths per year. Using his numbers,the daily average of female deaths was 3.84 in 2010, 3.61 in 2011, and 3.68 in 2012. Brown could have been a touch more precise with his wording by saying ""partners and former partners"" instead of just ""partners,"" but Rennison says that level of distinction is probably more important to academics. ""Generally when we talk in our field (about FBI or Bureau of Justice Statistics figures), we’re talking about current or former spouse, girlfriend or boyfriend, and it can include same-sex partners as well,"" she said. Our ruling Brown implored the NFL community and beyond to consider a shocking statistic: ""According to domestic violence experts, more than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners."" He went on to estimate how many women have been killed by their partners since the day Rice attacked his now-wife in an elevator -- a practice experts said isn’t scientifically precise but is a common practice. As for the three-deaths-a-day figure itself, experts said it is accurate. By some measures, the daily average is actually closer to four deaths. There are some ways that Brown could have been more precise, but they do not obscure his point. So we rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC680100>],/factchecks/2014/sep/16/james-brown/cbs-sports-james-brown-more-3-women-day-are-killed/

Attorney General Pam Bondi says Florida's pill mill doctors are gone
","Attorney General Pam Bondi has launched her re-election advertising campaign with a major milestone in Florida law enforcement: The death of the state’s infamous ""pill mills."" In a Sept. 8 TV commercial, the incumbent touts her record of overseeing the demise of rampant prescription drug abuse enabled by Florida doctors. ""With our amazing law enforcement, we closed down the pill mills,"" Bondi said. ""Of the top 100 oxycodone-­dispensing doctors in this country, 98 of them lived in Florida. Today, there are none."" That statistic implies Bondi was tough on crime, but PolitiFact Florida wanted to know if it was accurate. Closing the clinics The pill mill epidemic was a nationwide problem in 2010, driven by doctors who would write prescriptions and sell drugs out of clinics they owned themselves.   Florida’s lax laws gave the Sunshine State a reputation for easy access to the drug, so much so that billboards advertised to ""narco tourists"" -- buyers from out of state who would come to Florida to buy the drug. With more than 1,000 pain clinics in operation across the state, Florida became known as the ""Oxy Express."" Bondi, who was elected in 2010, was a staunch supporter of HB 7095, a 2011 law that increased penalties for doctors who abused prescription privileges, banned them from prescribing drugs like oxycodone and strengthened state regulatory power over prescription pill trafficking. The bill passed both houses of the Legislature unanimously on May 6, 2011, and was signed by Gov. Rick Scott on June 3, 2011. Bondi’s camp told PolitiFact Florida the stat in the commercial came from the Statewide Task Force on Prescription Drug Abuse & Newborns 2014 Progress Report, which specifically dealt with the effects of opiate abuse by pregnant women on their children. The report credited changes in Florida law that shut down many clinics. ""In 2010, 98 of the top 100 oxycodone pill dispensing physicians nationally resided in Florida,"" the report read. ""In 2011, after the passage of HB 7095, only 13 of the top 100 resided in Florida, and by the end of 2012, not one Florida doctor appeared on the top 100 list."" The report, which used figures that also were widely reported by the media, cited U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration data accessed January 2013. Bondi’s office also gave us a DEA press release from April 5, 2013, to back up that claim -- although that release said ""90 of the top 100 oxycodone purchasing physicians in the nation were located in Florida."" When we asked the attorney general’s office why there was a discrepancy in the numbers, they insisted the number was 98. The DEA stood firm, however: In 2010, the number was 90 of the top 100 oxycodone-purchasing doctors. The federal agency also told us the number of doctors in Florida in 2011, after HB 7095 passed, was down to 10 and not 13. But wait, Bondi’s commercial says ""oxycodone-dispensing doctors,"" not ""purchasing,"" as the DEA measured in 2010. That’s because the 2011 law no longer allowed physicians to simply buy the drug to resell, DEA public information officer Mia Ro told PolitiFact Florida. ""When the Florida law changed, it prevented physicians from dispensing pills out of their clinics,"" Ro said. The agency doesn’t track ""what’s filled or prescribed,"" she said. That means the DEA numbers weren’t tracking whether or not actual abuse had happened, just that Florida doctors were buying lots of oxycodone. Some physicians are still allowed to buy hydrocodone in large quantities, Ro said -- emergency room personnel, for example -- but private doctors could no longer buy the drug and sell it on their own. There was one unnamed DEA registrant from Florida who was in the top 100 oxycodone buyers in 2014, Ro said: A purchaser for a fleet of cruise ships, to use the drug in the fleet’s sick bays. That’s not to say pill mills weren’t a problem, or that the 2011 law didn’t make a difference. By the time HB 7095 was enacted, it was estimated as many as 11 people per day were dying from prescription drug abuse. From 2010 to 2012, overdose deaths from prescription drugs, illicit drugs and alcohol dropped nearly 17 percent, and overall prescription drug fatalities fell 23 percent, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. About 52 percent of that decrease was in deaths from oxycodone. Our ruling Bondi said that of the top 100 oxycodone-dispensing doctors, 98 were in Florida, and ""today, there are none."" She cited DEA numbers that since 2010, the number of physicians who dispensed the most oxycodone in the nation and also lived in Florida had dropped from 98 of the top 100 to zero. The DEA told us there are a few problems with that stat. First, it was for the biggest purchasers of oxycodone, not dispensers -- the DEA said the list didn't track dispensation. Second, the number in 2010 was 90 and not 98, although the 98 figure was widely reported by the state and the media in the past few years. Third, in 2014 there was one top 100 oxycodone purchaser in Florida, a buyer for a cruise ship fleet. The DEA data only tracks top purchasers, not whether actual drug use decreased, but other sources confirmed oxycodone abuse is on a downward trend in the state, although there’s debate over whether a 2011 law Bondi supported is the sole factor. While the specifics are a bit off, the gist and context of what Bondi is saying is accurate: There are no more Florida pill mill doctors in the DEA’s top 100.

"['Census', 'Redistricting', 'Texas', 'Garnet Coleman']","
State Rep. Garnet Coleman says nearly 90 percent of the population growth in Texas during the last decade was non-Anglo
","
Calling a Republican redraw of Texas House districts ""retrogressive,"" Democratic Rep. Garnet Coleman of Houston said it doesn’t reflect the state’s growing minority population.

From 2000 to 2010, ""close to 90 percent of the population growth in Texas was non-Anglo, yet this map reduces the number of districts where communities of color can elect their candidate of choice,"" he said in an April 28 press release. That day, the GOP-dominant House approved the revisions, which Coleman says eliminates one district in which Hispanics make up the majority of registered voters, sending the plan to the Senate.

We’re not going to weigh in on whether the map disenfranchises voters. But we wondered whether he correctly pegged the state’s non-Anglo population growth.

In April 2010, the Democratic Lone Star Project similarly said the state was expected to gain congressional seats ""almost entirely due to the growth of the African American and Hispanic populations in Texas in virtually every region of the state."" We rated that Mostly True, finding that Hispanic growth seemed likely to deserve credit for Texas gaining seats, but that would be uncertain until the 2010 Census was complete.

One year later, it is. And responding to our request for evidence to support Coleman’s  claim, Joe Madden, Coleman’s chief of staff, pointed us to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

According to the 2010 Census, Texas grew 20.6 percent in the decade. It was the fifth fastest-growing state behind Nevada, Arizona, Utah and Idaho. By raw numbers alone, Texas’ population increased by about 4.3 million people. California, which retained the largest population, increased by 3.4 million.  

How much of Texas’ population growth was due to non-Anglos?

According to census data, in 2000, about 9.9 million minorities — people who reported their ethnicity and race as something other than non-Hispanic white — accounted for 47.6 percent of the state’s population. From 2000 to 2010, the minority population swelled by 3.8 million, accounting for 54.7 percent of the population — and also making minorities responsible for about 89 percent of the state’s growth through the decade.

According to a Feb. 18 Austin American-Statesman news article analyzing the new census data, Latinos accounted for two-thirds of Texas' growth over the decade and made up 37.6 percent of the state's total population through 2010, while blacks made up 11.5 percent of the growth.

Robert Bernstein, a Census Bureau spokesman, told us that Coleman was ""pretty much on the mark.""

We rate Coleman’s statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA17240>],/factchecks/2011/may/09/garnet-coleman/state-rep-garnet-coleman-says-nearly-90-percent-po/

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says Milwaukee County paid employees over $170,000 in 2010 to work for their unions
","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker promoted his budget-repair bill in February 2011 by saying it would balance the state budget and ""give government the tools to deal with this and future budget crises.""

One tool was designed to sharply curtail the collective bargaining powers of most state and local government employees, and eliminate collective bargaining altogether for others. It was that part of the Republican governor’s bill that led Democratic state senators to hotfoot it to Illinois and protesters to stage daily demonstrations in Madison.

Walker issued a number of statements touting the bill, including two entitled ""Collective bargaining is a fiscal issue."" The second statement, issued Feb. 22, 2011, made this claim:

""In Milwaukee County alone, because the union collectively bargained for paid time off, 14 employees receive salary and benefits for doing union business. Of the 14, three are on full-time release for union business. Milwaukee County spent over $170,000 in salary alone for these employees to only participate in union activities such as collective bargaining.""

Another Walker news release repeated the claim the next day and added: ""The budget-repair bill reforms would help counties, like Milwaukee County, save on these costs.""

The dollar sign in Walker’s claim made us wonder:

Did Milwaukee County pay employees over $170,000 not to do work for the county, but for their unions?

Walker’s claim was made more than two months ago, but collective bargaining remains at the top of the state’s political agenda. The issue is part of efforts to recall state senators from office. And on June 6, 2011, the state Supreme Court is scheduled to hold a hearing about whether it should be the court to consider a legal challenge to Walker’s measure.

We asked the governor’s office what the $170,000 referred to, and were told Milwaukee County spent more than that amount in 2010 on salaries for county employees for doing union work.

As support, the governor’s office forwarded a report it received from Milwaukee County payroll manager Sue Drummond the day before it issued the news release that made the $170,000 claim. The report listed county employees who received pay in 2010 for time they spent carrying out union duties.

For several decades, union contracts agreed upon by Milwaukee County provide for certain employees to be paid when they are doing union activities. The activities can include attending County Board meetings, representing a worker in a disciplinary hearing and participating in contract talks, among other things.

In this item, we’re not weighing in on the merits of the practice; we’re checking the accuracy of Walker’s claim on the cost to Milwaukee County. We’ll also check a few other places, including the city of Milwaukee and the state, for some added context.

The report forwarded to us by the governor’s office did not tally how much in salaries the county paid to employees doing union work. But an analysis provided by the governor’s office said the county in 2010 paid $170,593 in salaries to county employees for doing union work.

We then asked the county directly to provide figures. A report issued to us May 6, 2011 from county controller Scott Manske showed that in 2010: 

Zunker, who heads Milwaukee County’s largest union with some 1,100 members, said the system for paying some county employees to do union work is a benefit county employees have earned as part of the give-and-take that occurs in bargaining contracts with the county.

Chris Pegelow, a former Milwaukee County employee who served as president of the same union, said putting county employees in union positions full time arguably saves the county money and time in settling workplace disputes that might otherwise escalate into legal cases. Because they are full-time union presidents, those employees are more accessible to county officials and more knowledgeable about workplace issues, he said. The system is also less disruptive than if the union presidents worked full-time in county positions and had to be released from those duties each time a workplace issue arose, he said.

The City of Milwaukee spent more than the county in 2010 on employees doing union work. The city spent $291,253 on salaries and $215,419 in benefits for seven employees who hold full-time union positions, said city labor relations officer Joe Alvarado. The figures, which are set by contract between the city and the unions, will be the same for 2011, he said.

The city pays full benefits to the president, vice president and secretary/treasurer of the police union, plus half the salary of the vice president and secretary/treasurer, Alvarado said.

For the other four employees who do union work full-time, the city pays the full salary and benefits, Alvarado said  The employees include the heads of the unions that represent firefighters, sanitation workers, the Department of Public Works and other departments, and truck drivers and service equipment workers.

Alvarado said the system has been in place since the Milwaukee Police Association negotiated for one such position some 40 years ago.

Meanwhile, the state does not pay any employees to do only union work, said Carla Vigue, spokeswoman for the state Department of Administration. But it does allow employees to conduct union activities at various times while they’re on the clock.

In 2010, according to a summary provided by Vigue, employees representing 16 unions spent 30,783 work hours on union activities. Those hours, which Vigue said were logged by 466 employees, amounted to $705,731 in salaries, according to the summary.

It remains to be seen how many government employees would continue to be paid for doing union business if Walker’s bill, which was adopted into law by the Legislature, survives court challenges. Unions representing police officers, firefighters and state troopers could continue to collectively bargain for such arrangements, since they are exempted from Walker’s bill.

However, unions representing other public employees would be allowed to bargain only for base pay. That means it would be up to the government to decide whether to continue to pay some employees for doing union work, said Walker spokesman  Cullen Werwie.

Let’s wrap up.

Gov. Walker said Milwaukee County spent more than $170,000 in 2010 on salaries for employees doing union activities. The actual tally, according to the county -- for three union presidents who did union work full-time and other employees who did occasional union work -- was $180,385. We rate Walker’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC75D3C0>],/factchecks/2011/may/08/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-milwaukee-county-p/
"['State Budget', 'Texas', 'Steve Ogden']","
State Sen. Steve Ogden says Perry advocated to liquidate the state's rainy day fund
","
As state senators edged toward a party-line divide on the 2012-13 state budget, state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, questioned the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee on GOP Gov. Rick Perry’s past positions on taking money from the state’s Economic Stabilization Fund, better known as the rainy day fund.

On the Senate floor May 3, Watson said to Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan: ""A couple of times, Gov. Perry has actually ... advocated for spending the (fund), hasn't he?"" Ogden replied: ""He's advocated to liquidate it.""

Ogden added: ""I believe it was four years ago and that proposal was made and soundly rejected by"" the Senate.

Ogden’s comment caught our attention because Perry declared in March he won’t sign off on a 2012-13 budget that taps any dollars in the fund.

Some background: The stabilization fund, created in 1988, accumulates money from portions of oil and/or gas production taxes; it also receives half of any unencumbered state revenue -- unspent dollars not reserved for a specific purpose -- at the end of each two-year budget period. Money has been taken from the fund in the past, including more than $3 billion during Perry’s tenure as governor.

In 2003, lawmakers diverted $295 million in rainy-day dollars to launch an enterprise fund overseen by Perry to lure businesses to the state. Two years later, more money was taken from the fund to start an emerging technology fund overseen by the governor.

Sharp increases in natural gas prices have boosted its balance, which was nearly $8.2 billion in January and is projected to be $9.4 billion at the end of August 2013.

In March, Perry revealed he’d support taking $3.1 billion from the fund to shore up the current budget, which runs through August. However, Perry said, ""I remain steadfastly committed to protecting the remaining balance of the"" fund ""and will not sign a 2012-2013 state budget that uses"" it.

Ogden has thrown the liquidation jab before.

A May 3 commentary by Peggy Fikac of Hearst Newspapers quotes Ogden recalling Perry’s 2007 stance on the rainy day fund: ""Four years ago, the governor said we didn't even need one. And in fact, the governor tried to get us to liquidate it... his theory was, as I remember . . . that it's excessive taxation on the people, and why are we collecting all this money and doing nothing with it?""

The article also quotes a Perry spokeswoman saying the governor did not propose to liquidate the fund. 

When we tried to follow up with Ogden, he declined to elaborate on his floor statement. Separately, we checked news archives, finding that during the 2007 legislative session Perry was willing to tap the fund to finance additional school property-tax cuts. In 2005 and 2003, Perry signed off on budgets that basically drained the fund’s existing balance, mostly to meet budget shortfalls. In the latter instance, the fund ended up with more money in it than projected, thanks to unexpected revenue due to higher oil and gas prices.

A May 3, 2007, Associated Press report quotes Perry urging lawmakers to divert money intended for the fund to finance additional school property tax cuts. But Ogden spokeswoman Constance Allison told us Ogden’s liquidation comment was not referring to that proposal. Instead, she said, Ogden was talking about Perry’s 2007 desire to return rainy-day monies in the form of rebates to Texas taxpayers. 

The governor included legislation authorizing rebates among his emergency items for that session, according to a Jan. 12, 2007 press release from his office in which he said: ""To keep government fiscally responsible, state leaders need the authority to rebate surplus funds directly to taxpayers.""

In his February 2007 State-of-the-State address to lawmakers, Perry said he was proposing a budget that ""grows the Rainy Day Fund to more than $4 billion"" while setting aside $2.5 billion more for property tax relief. His speech continued: ""One way to provide tax relief is in the form of a rebate. The appeal of a one-time rebate is that future legislatures don’t have to find the money to sustain it. However, the will of the Legislature may be to provide rate relief instead.  Either way is better than the alternative: which is having the money spent on more government.""

According to a Jan. 29, 2007, Houston Chronicle news article, Ogden was cool to the rebate idea. Asked his opinion of it, he said: ""Not much . . .The big issue to me in this session is to make sure that we set aside enough of the surplus to guarantee that we'll be able to meet our property tax promises in future years."" Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst aired a similar sentiment.

Neither the Chronicle article nor Perry’s formal messages say the governor wanted to empty the Rainy Day Fund to provide rebates. In an interview, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said Perry did not call for depleting the fund then and now considers it prudent to leave the fund intact. He has, however, said he’ll go along with taking out $3.1 billion to cover gaps in the current budget, which runs through August.

In the end, the 2007 Legislature took no money from the fund, according to a 2011 policy paper on the fund’s history by the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities, which has urged the 2011 Legislature to maintain existing government programs through 2012-13 by leaning on the fund.

According to the state comptroller’s office, the state later ended fiscal 2008 with more than $4.3 billion in the fund and closed the next year with a balance of more than $6.7 billion. 

End of story? Not quite. 

In a May 5 blog post by Fikac on the Houston Chronicle website, Perry acknowledged he advocated liquidating the rainy day fund — in 2005. ""I did,"" Fikac quotes Perry saying. ""If you’ll recall, it was during a period of time when we had major surpluses. I don’t see any reason to have huge amounts of money in a rainy day fund when you have just massive surpluses. If you recall, in 2005 we had a $10 billion budget surplus relative to the two-year budget before.""

As for what he was going to do with the fund after it was liquidated, Perry said he didn’t remember the details. ""You’re asking me things I can’t give you specific answers to. I’ll speak to you philosophically about what I was thinking about, which is why have a big stack of money sitting over in the side when you have large budget surpluses.""

Winding up: We found no record that Perry proposed to empty the rainy day fund to pay for rebates in 2007 — he never specified what they would cost — or that the Senate ""roundly rejected"" such an idea. The record does show that Perry’s rebate proposal got nowhere in the Legislature.

It also shows that despite Perry’s avowed distaste for tapping the rainy day fund, he has repeatedly approved state budgets that effectively spent it all. And that was the larger point Ogden and Watson were trying to make in their exchange on the Senate floor.

Former House Minority Leader says marijuana is recognized as a treatment for his pancreas pain.
","On the night of April 22, 2011, Rep. Robert Watson, R-East Greenwich, was stopped at a Connecticut sobriety checkpoint and ultimately charged with both driving under the influence and marijuana possession.

In a floor speech the following Tuesday, the then-House minority leader said he was not under the influence. He said he had not smoked marijuana, and his blood-alcohol level tested at 0.05, which is below the legal limit of 0.08.

Watson told fellow House members he had ""a very small bag with trace amounts of marijuana and a smoking instrument."" He was carrying the marijuana, he said, in case he had an attack of pancreatitis.

""I'm well aware that medical marijuana is a recognized, medical, viable treatment for this sort of pain condition,"" he said in his speech, which garnered a standing ovation from Republicans and other House members at the time. (But a week later, the Republican caucus ousted him as minority leader.)

Watson, citing personal privacy, has not released details of his medical record; results of his blood test will be the subject of his court hearing in Connecticut. But we wanted to weed out the facts on whether marijuana is actually recognized as a treatment for the pain of pancreatitis, an extraordinarily painful condition that Watson described as akin to a gunshot to the chest.

First, some background.

The pancreas, located behind the stomach, releases enzymes that aid in digestion. It also releases the insulin the body needs to control blood sugar. The enzymes flow out a tube into the small intestine near the stomach.

Unfortunately, a portion of that tube is shared with the gallbladder. Sometimes tiny stones form in the gallbladder, migrate down the tube and block the portion that drains the pancreas. The result is painful inflammation -- pancreatitis.

Doctors can usually see the stones with ultrasound or some other form of imaging. In those cases, either the stone eventually works its way free or doctors remove it. In either case, doctors urge patients to have the gall bladder removed. End of problem.

The second major cause of pancreatitis is alcohol. When that's the case, doctors insist that patients abstain from drinking because one attack can lead to others, damaging the pancreas in a way that leads to chronic pancreatitis.

""The recommendation is pretty much to not take any alcohol because alcohol is a toxin to the pancreas,"" said Dr. Alyn Adrain, a gastroenterologist and clinical assistant professor of medicine at Brown University.

Heavy smoking may also increase the risk, said Dr. Vikesh Singh, director of the Pancreatitis Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. That risk can be difficult to tease out because smoking and drinking often go hand in hand.

Pancreatitis can also be caused by inherited deformities in the pancreas. There have also been at least two studies covering four patients suggesting that marijuana, by itself, can cause a pancreatitis attack. In other instances, doctors have trouble pinpointing a cause.

Watson politely declined to answer most questions about his condition, saying he believes his health should be a private matter. Watson did, however, reveal elements of his illness during his speech on the floor of the House.

He said his initial attack of pancreas pain was at Halloween. He said he went to the hospital the next day, where he had a severe reaction to a drug, prompting doctors to put him in a medically induced coma for five days.

He said he subsequently had other attacks. He did not disclose the number and severity.

""I did treat with medical marijuana on one of those rare occasions where I had that debilitating pain that had me flat on my back"" wondering whether to call an ambulance, he said.

He also reported having a recurrence the day before his arrest, but said he did not use marijuana then.

Watson said that when he tried the drug, ""it provided relief and it alleviated the pain . . . I believed it was responsible self-therapy.""

Watson said he had not applied for authorization to use medical marijuana.

But is marijuana ""a recognized, medical, viable treatment for this sort of pain condition,"" as he contends?

As a treatment for pancreatitis pain, let's be blunt. The simple answer is ""No.""

Both Doctors Singh and Adrain said there are no studies in the medical literature showing that marijuana is an effective treatment for the pain of a pancreatitis attack.

""There is no reason to use marijuana for acute pancreatitis,"" said Singh. ""There are no studies evaluating the use of cannabis for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis pain.""

""I've never given it for chronic pain from pancreatitis and I don't know anyone who has,"" said Adrain.

When we contacted Watson, he said his statement should be considered in the context of treatment for severe pain in general. The state's guidelines for medical marijuana use say ""qualifying debilitating medical conditions"" include ""a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition or its treatment"" that produces any of six conditions, including ""severe, debilitating, chronic pain.""

In that context, the doctors we interviewed said marijuana MIGHT be useful in some cases, just as the drug helps some patients cope with cancer pain.

""It might help. There's just no good evidence to prove it’s worthwhile,"" said Singh.

Finally, we looked to Canada, where the use of medical marijuana has been legal for years.  Health Canada, which authorizes medical marijuana use, lists seven conditions -- multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or disease, cancer, HIV, epilepsy, severe arthritis -- where the use is routinely accepted. For other conditions, a specialist must confirm ""that conventional treatments have failed or [are] judged inappropriate to relieve symptoms.""

And Dr. Mark Ware, associate medical director of the McGill University Health Centre Pain Clinic in Montreal, told us in an email that pancreatitis is a different kind of pain. ""This is a visceral pain syndrome and most cannabis studies have focused on neuropathic pain."" The personal reports you can find on the web ""have not been validated or evaluated.""

So as far as we could determine, it's neither recognized nor recommended by the medical community for this use. There are certainly no studies to support its use.

We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEF6D00>],/factchecks/2011/may/08/robert-watson/former-house-minority-leader-says-marijuana-recogn/

Senator rails against growing conforming budget bills
","
A group of state senators temporarily threw the Florida Legislature into upheaval on May 6, 2011, after several Republicans joined Democrats in opposing a pair of bills that were tied to the $69.7 billion budget.

The bills -- called conforming bills -- generally provide language to carry out how the Legislature wants money in the budget to be spent. But leaders in the House and Senate also tacked on two substantive bills to deregulate several professions, including interior designers. On top of that, senators had just hours to read the bills -- 43 of them -- and then cast votes.

So, senators put their collective foot down.

A bill to deregulate interior designers died in the Senate 32-6. Another conforming bill died 21-18.

State Sen. Jack Latvala, who previously served in the Senate from 1994-2002 and was elected again in 2010, took to the floor early in the morning on May 7 to decry the entire process.

""I don't really want to get into winners and losers. I think that winners and losers, which ever way they interpret it, are the people of Florida,"" Latvala said. ""There is one lesson I hope we learn. When I left the Florida Senate in 2002, the (conforming) bill was 11 or 12 pages. Sen. (Thad) Altman recently counted the number of pages for the implementing bill in 2008, it was 400 pages. I mean, conforming bills. Sen. Altman also counted the pages in the conforming bills this year -- 2,200.

""In three years, the pages in the conforming bills have gone from 400 pages to 2,200,"" he said.

Talking directly to Senate President Mike Haridopolos, Latvala then said: ""I pray that when we have the closing night of our session next year that your leadership will show us that we can turn the clock back on that trend.""

Latvala's numbers -- courtesy of Altman -- may sound staggering. But they're pretty much right.

House and Senate leaders proposed 43 conforming bills to go alongside their nearly 500-page budget. We counted the pages of each of the bills. Some takeaways:

* A government reorganization bill, SB 2156, was so big that we couldn't download it onto our computer in an Adobe Acrobat version. We had to open a different version of the bill to find out that it includes 20,990 lines of text -- which would translate to about 740 pages;

* A growth management bill, HB 7207, measured 349 total pages;

* The smallest conforming bill was just two pages. It eliminated the cybercrime unit in the Attorney General's office.

In total, we counted 2,170 pages of conforming bills (the specific number can vary slightly based on the exact number of pages in the government reorganization bill).

Compare that to 2008, when there were 29 conforming bills and a total of 499 pages. We built a spreadsheet so you can see the difference between the years for yourself.

Latvala said that from 2008-2001, ""the pages in the conforming bills have gone from 400 pages to 2,200."" We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB710C0>],/factchecks/2011/may/07/jack-latvala/senator-rails-against-growing-conforming-budget-bi/
"['Oregon', 'Transportation', 'John Lee']","
Did The Oregonian debunk a 10-year old study on Sellwood Bridge traffic?
","
PolitiFact Oregon loves to see The Oregonian cited in arguments for and against ballot measures. It makes us feel useful. So we were initially pleased to read in the arguments against a new vehicle registration fee for the Sellwood Bridge this comment from Clackamas County GOP Chairman John Lee: ""The study that states that >70% of the traffic on the bridge is to/from Clackamas is over 10 years old and has been thoroughly debunked by the Oregonian.""  

Measure 3-372, for those who don’t follow Clackamas County news, would increase the state’s motor vehicle registration by $5 a year for county residents. The money, about $22 million, would go toward replacing the dilapidated Sellwood Bridge that is in neighboring Multnomah County but used by Clackamas County residents.

Just how much of the bridge is used by those residents has played a central role in the campaign. Proponents like to cite Metro’s May 1999 South Willamette River Crossing Study,which shows that about 70 percentof the 30,000 trips across the bridge each day originate or end inClackamas County.

Opponents of the measure argue that the study is dated and in fact says no such thing. This is where PolitiFact Oregon comes in.

First, we dug up the study and on page 5 we found the relevant pie chart. The pie shows that 50 percent of trips over the bridge are between Clackamas County and Portland; 13 percent of trips are between Clackamas and Washington counties; and 7 percent of trips are between east and west Clackamas County. That adds up to 70 percent of trips either end or begin in Clackamas County.

But wait, here’s the rest of the pie: 17 percent of trips are between the east and west sides of Portland, and 13 percent of trips are between Portland and Washington County. So the pie chart also states that 80 percent of the trips end or begin in Portland.

Both percentages were included in a Feb. 16 story by Yuxing Zheng, The Oregonian’s Clackamas County reporter. So it turns out she added some context from the study -- but it’s a pretty far stretch to say that The Oregonian ""debunked"" anything.

""We have not debunked it at all,"" she said, ""because it is factually correct.""

Now we acknowledge that the 1999 study is old, with traffic figures based on 1994 travel. So we poked around for newer figures and found this: a 2006 semi-update of the 1999 study with 2030 traffic projections. This version projected 76 percent of trips starting or ending in Clackamas County, with 9 percent of trips solely within the county. Trips ending or starting in Multnomah County would account for 79 percent of trips. (This totals more that 100 percent because trips can begin or end in either county.)

We talked to Lee about this, and were rather impressed with his candor in a follow-up email.

""My statement that the Oregonian ""debunked"" the study rather than the >70% Clackamas traffic may have been worded better,"" he wrote, adding that he was really bristling at previous media reports that characterized Clackamas County residents as making 70 percent of bridge trips, which is not completely accurate.

For example, The Oregonian published an editorial and a news story in February 2010 about a Portland City Club report, which inaccurately stated that Clackamas County drivers would account for three times the number of trips across the Sellwood Bridge as Multnomah County drivers. The Oregonian corrected that figure in a March story when City Club issued a correction; the March story also stated that 79 percent of traffic would start or end in Multnomah County, and 76 percent would start or end in Clackamas County.

""The impression given to voters has been that Clackamas residents use the Sellwood bridge MUCH more than anyone else so they should pay for it to be replaced,"" Lee wrote.

We feel for the GOP county chairman. It’s frustrating when statistics are short-handed to the point of being inaccurate. But we have to object to his claim that The Oregonian debunked a study that claimed ""more than 70 percent of trips ends or starts in Clackamas County."" The March 2010 story simply corrected one figure -- which was retracted by City Club itself -- and added context.

We rate the statement False.

State Rep. Rick Hardcastle says benzene has never been proven to be harmful
","
During House debate, state Rep. Rick Hardcastle brushed off a colleague’s concerns about benzene emissions near Texas schools.  ""Are you aware benzene is also a compound in soap?"" Hardcastle said April 28. ""Found at every car wash in this state — and several other industries in this state? And it’s never been proven to be harmful.""

The Vernon Republican was opposing an amendment by Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, that would prohibit the Oil and Gas Commission from issuing drilling permits for gas wells within 1,200 feet from a public school unless they meet a set of conditions, including installing emission controls and ensuring certain pollutants, such as benzene, fall below certain concentrations.

Members tabled Burnam’s proposal. Still, we wondered if benzene has really never been proven harmful?

First, a benzene primer: According to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, benzene is an organic chemical compound found most often in the air as a result of emissions from burning coal and oil, drilling for natural gas or in gasoline vapors, car exhaust, cigarette smoke and other sources. The chemical also is used as a solvent for inks, paint and plastics and to manufacture detergents.

EPA spokesman Joe Hubbard told us benzene is a ""widely used chemical formed from both natural processes and human activities."" Still, in 1986, the agency classified benzene as a ""human carcinogen and hazardous air pollutant,"" he said.

When we reached Hardcastle, he agreed that benzene is ""a proven carcinogen"" but said that’s only so when a person is ""overly-exposed to it"" for a long period of time. Otherwise, he said, it hasn’t been proven harmful.

""It’s a carcinogen, but everything’s a carcinogen,"" he said. ""You eat too much white bread and it’s a carcinogen.""

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokesman Terry Clawson told us that benzene is harmful depending on its concentration in air and how long someone is exposed to it. ""Typical outdoor concentrations"" of benzene, less than one part per billion, are ""much lower than concentrations that have been shown to cause harmful effects in people,"" he said. But exposure to higher concentrations, tens of thousands of parts per billion, over a period of many months to years ""has been shown to cause harmful effects on blood,"" he said. Longer exposures, over many years, have ""been shown to cause leukemia in workers,"" he said.

A fact sheet issued by the agency in October 2007 says as much: ""Permitted levels of benzene should not cause adverse health and welfare effects,"" but breathing high levels of the chemical compound can damage blood cells, human studies indicate. ""Some occupational workers, who have been exposed to some of the highest air concentrations of benzene for years, experienced a decrease in the number of white blood cells circulating in their blood.""

According to the EPA’s web page on hazards associated with benzene, chronic exposure for a year or more has caused blood disorders, including reduced numbers of red blood cells and aplastic anemia — a risk factor for developing acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. The EPA site says short-term exposure to benzene may cause drowsiness, dizziness, headaches, eye, skin and respiratory tract irritation, and, at high levels, unconsciousness.

And a February 2009 study funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences found that leukemia risks could be greater at ambient levels of benzene exposure — that is, benzene in the air where people live, rather than where they work —  than previously thought.

A 2009 EPA summary says that some studies, such as those gauging links between childhood exposure to benzene and childhood cancer, are equivocal. A 2001 study found a connection between Hodgkins lymphoma and young children who lived in high-traffic ares with higher concentrations of benzene during pregnancy or early childhood, while a 2002 study found no connection between childhood cancer rates and benzene concentrations in high-traffic neighborhoods.

Closer to home, a 2010 study by researchers at the University of Texas and the Texas Department of State Health Services found that women living in Texas neighborhoods with high levels of benzene (more than 3 micrograms per cubic meter of air) were more likely to bear children with spinal bifida — a serious birth defect that can cause paralysis and neurological disorders.

According to an August 2007 benzene fact sheet published by the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, ""some women who breathed high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods and a decrease in the size of their ovaries."" But, according to the fact sheet, ""we do not know for certain that benzene caused these effects.""

Recent studies have found that environmental exposure to benzene increases the risk of childhood cancer, birth defects and lowers birth weight, he said. ""Cancer is not the only concern. ""While it’s true that the only ‘proven’ effects are in occupationally exposed workers, studies strongly suggest that adverse effects on children and pregnant women are probably at lower environmental levels.

Finally, Martyn Smith, a toxicology professor at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied the health effects of benzene, told us that Hardcastle is ""wrong.""

There is no known threshold for when benzene becomes carcinogenic, Smith said. According to a study Smith authored that was published in the Annual Review of Public Health in April 2010, ""there is probably no safe level of exposure of benzene, and all exposures constitute some risk.""

Where does that leave us?

It’s true that benzene is a common air pollutant and is found in everyday products such as detergents. But to claim that airborne benzene has not been proven harmful flies in the face of scientific evidence that long-term exposure in the workplace can cause cancer and other negative health effects — not to mention studies suggesting lower levels of environmental exposure may also be unsafe.

U.S. Rep. Ron Paul says prices are increasing and unemployment is continuing to increase
","
U.S. Rep. Ron Paul is courting the belly vote.

During the first 2012 presidential debate in South Carolina on Thursday, the Texas Republican said the economy will cause President Barack Obama’s re-election efforts to suffer.

""My theory is that people vote from their bellies because it’s whether they’re hungry or not or have jobs and need things, that’s why people vote,"" Paul said. ""And we’re in big trouble. Prices are going up, unemployment is continuing to go up.""

We decided to check whether both prices and unemployment are rising.

Let’s start with the former.

Cheryl Abbot, an economist at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, told us that prices are almost always going up because of inflation — the question is whether prices have been increasing at a faster rate as of late.

And the answer is yes. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index, year-over-year inflation rate has been accelerating since November 2010, when the rate was 1.1 percent. The bureau’s most recent data is from March, when the inflation rate was 2.7 percent.

The price spike is ""almost entirely due to gasoline prices,"" Abbot said. Take gasoline prices out of the picture, and the rate change is nominal, she said.

What about unemployment?

Flash back to January 2008, when the unemployment rate stood at a mere 5 percent. By October 2009, it was 10.1 percent. During most of 2010, unemployment hovered just below 10 percent, peaking in November at 9.8 percent.

But since then, the rate has fallen every month, dropping to 8.8 percent in March.

Until today, that is, when the the bureau reported that unemployment ticked up two-tenths of a point, to 9 percent, in April.

That’s still high by historical standards, Abbot said, but she quibbles with Paul’s claim that unemployment ""continues to go up.""

So do we. We have no qualms with Paul’s price claim, but unemployment has dropped steadily for four of the last five months. And the labor bureau didn’t report April’s uptick until after Paul made his debate talking point.

We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC0A380>],/factchecks/2011/may/06/ron-paul/us-rep-ron-paul-says-prices-are-increasing-and-une/

Tim Pawlenty quotes Obama's words on health care from the Iowa caucuses
","
Tim Pawlenty had the chance to attack Mitt Romney's 2002 Massachusetts health care plan at a debate for Republican presidential candidates on the Fox News Channel on May 5, 2011. Pawlenty attended the debate; Romney didn't.

Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, opted instead to attack President Barack Obama's health care plan, calling the new law ""a top-down, government-run, centralized, limited choice, limited option system.""

""President Obama stood in Iowa in 2008 on the night of the Iowa caucuses and he promised the nation that he would do health care reform focused on cost containment, he opposed an individual mandate, and he said he was going to do it with Republicans. He broke that promise,"" Pawlenty said. 

We've investigated the charge that the law is a ""government takeover"" of health care and rated it False. (In fact, it was our 2010 Lie of the Year.) The health care law does dramatically increase federal regulation of health insurance, but it leaves in place private insurance and private health care providers. Some have said the plan is the same as the one Romney supported in Massachusetts back in 2002, a claim we've rated Mostly True. The federal law isn't an exact copy, but it's very similar.  
At the debate, the moderator described the Massachusetts plan and then asked Pawlenty, ""A poll just weeks ago showed that 84 percent of Massachusetts residents are satisfied with the plan. Why isn't that good enough for you?"" Pawlenty didn't directly answer the question, instead opting to attack Obama's plan. 
Here, we were interested in checking Pawlenty's statement about what Obama said on the night of the Iowa caucuses, that he ""promised the nation that he would do health care reform focused on cost containment, he opposed an individual mandate, and he said he was going to do it with Republicans."" We wondered if that was accurate or if Pawlenty was putting words in Obama's mouth. 
We found a copy of Obama's comments and identified the brief yet relevant passage. Here's what Obama said: ""I'll be a president who finally makes health care affordable and available to every single American, the same way I expanded health care in Illinois, by bringing Democrats and Republicans together to get the job done."" 
Let's take this piece by piece: 
Obama ""said he was going to do it with Republicans.""  Indeed, Obama said he would bring the parties together ""to get the job done."" It's also clear he did not succeed at that. The final health care law passed without a single Republican vote, and a few Democrats even crossed over to vote against the bill. (One Republican House member did vote for an early version of the bill, but not the final version.) Some Obama supporters have argued that he tried to work with Republicans -- debate on the bill dragged on for more than a year -- but was unsuccessful. Whatever the reasons, the bottom line is, yes, Obama said he'd enlist Republicans, but no, it didn't happen. We'd rate this point True.  
Obama said he ""opposed an individual mandate."" You may not remember this, but we sure do: Obama opposed requiring people to buy health insurance, a point that was endlessly debated in the 2008 Democratic primaries. Obama's plan did not include a mandate; plans from candidates Hillary Clinton and John Edwards did. ""I believe the problem is not that folks are trying to avoid getting health care. The problem is they can't afford it. And that's why my plan emphasizes lowering costs,"" Obama said back then.  
The night of the Iowa caucuses, Obama said he wanted to make health ""available"" to all Americans. Given all the discussion of the mandate back them, it seems that was an allusion to his opposition to the mandate. As actual legislation was being developed in 2009, however, Obama changed his mind about the individual mandate and accepted it. We rated his change of heart a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter. Obama said he was willing to accept it as long as it included a hardship exemption. The individual mandate works by imposing fines on people who don't have insurance. If people can't find affordable insurance to buy, as measured by a percentage of income, they would qualify for the exemption.  
On this one, Obama didn't mention an individual mandate explicitly on the night of the caucuses. But he seemed to allude to it, and it was widely known to be his position. He later changed on that, and the final bill did include a mandate. We'd rate this point by Pawlenty Mostly True. 
Obama said ""he would do health care reform focused on cost containment."" On the night of the Iowa caucuses, Obama didn't say he would focus on cost containment; he said he would make health care ""affordable and available."" It's not exactly the same thing. But then we pulled up our old copy of Obama's health care plan, and it reminded us of how much it emphasized cost containment. Pawlenty argues that Obama's plan doesn't focus on cost containment; Obama would no doubt disagree. In our analysis of the health care plan, we've noted that it does include a variety of measures aimed at containing costs, but there's uncertainty as to how well these measures will work in the coming years. According to official projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, people will see different amounts of cost savings, depending on what kind of insurance they have. Finally, officials in Massachusetts are still working on containing costs. So this point is a bit murkier, and we'd rate it Half True. 
Pawlenty claims that Obama broke his promises. It's clear that Obama didn't get Republican votes for health care, and he reversed himself on opposing an individual mandate. The jury's still out on cost containment. However, we have been tracking a campaign promise of Obama's to ""cut the cost of a typical family's health insurance premium by up to $2,500 a year."" We've rated that promise Stalled, because premiums are not projected to decrease in the coming years. There's a bit of uncertainty there, however, as it will be several years before the health care law is fully implemented. 
Overall, we rate Pawlenty's statement Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBCFC440>],/factchecks/2011/may/06/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-quotes-obamas-words-health-care-iowa-/
"['National', 'Taxes', 'Gary Johnson']","
Gary Johnson says U.S. has ""the highest corporate income tax in the world right now”
","
If there’s one issue that binds Republicans, it’s a preference for low taxes. So it’s no surprise that in the first debate of the 2012 presidential campaign -- held May 5, 2011, in Greenville, S.C. -- the topic came up.

At one point, Fox News commentator Juan Williams asked Gary Johnson -- the former Republican governor of New Mexico and a strong libertarian -- about corporate taxation.

""Gov. Johnson,"" Williams said, ""the nation's unemployment rate is 8.8 percent and this week, jobless claims rose to their highest level in eight months. Among your proposals for getting the private sector to start hiring are eliminating corporate income tax, doing away with the federal minimum wage law and to stop extending unemployment benefits. Isn't that just a windfall for big business?""

Johnson responded, ""Well, absolutely not. I think that repealing, or doing away with the corporate income tax is simply getting us back to where we were. And we need to understand that the corporate income tax is a double tax -- that we all own the corporations, and when income gets distributed to us, we pay the tax on that. So, we have the highest corporate income tax in the world right now. Let's abolish it.""

We have looked at the question of whether the United States has ""the highest corporate income tax in the world"" in previous items, so we thought we’d revisit it now.

There are two primary ways to compare corporate tax burdens. One is to compare statutory corporate tax rate -- the rate that’s actually on the books.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of more than two-dozen large, industrialized democracies, publishes the rates of its member countries. The most recent data shows Japan on top at 39.54 percent, vs. 39.21 percent for the United States. Japan had been scheduled to cut its corporate tax rate to a level below the United States, but the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster that crippled portions of the country earlier this year has left that in doubt.

The other way to look at it is to gauge what firms actually pay, once exclusions and other adjustments are taken into account. This is called the ""effective"" tax rate.

The World Bank has assembled data from 183 nations and made a series of statistical adjustments to produce a full international comparison of effective tax rates. By this measurement, the U.S. rate is considerably lower than the published rate -- 27.6 percent. But in a comparative sense, that's still pretty high: Among larger international economies, only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand imposed a higher effective rate, according to the World Bank study.
   
The World Bank also produces another -- and broader -- statistic. It factors in not only the corporate profit tax but also a range of other taxes paid by businesses, including the cost of employee taxes borne by the employer. When the World Bank ranked countries from the lowest level of taxes to the highest, the U.S. ranked 124th out of 183 -- meaning corporate taxes were relatively high. A number of other large and/or democratic countries were higher, including Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Spain and Sweden.
   
This last measure provides a wider snapshot of U.S. tax policy toward businesses, but it also introduces some complications. Factoring in the employer-paid portion of labor taxes makes the corporate tax rate seem higher in countries that provide higher benefits such as pensions or health care through business taxes, while making the rate seem lower for countries that provide less generous benefits through the tax code. So making apples-to-apples comparisons can be tricky.

There's also broader context that Johnson doesn't get into. In a previous item, we noted that when all taxes, including those such as personal income taxes and property taxes -- not just corporate taxes -- are taken into account and compared to gross domestic product, the U.S. doesn't rank near the top of the OECD table in total tax burden.

Still, Johnson’s claim was more limited, addressing only corporate taxation.

To be more accurate, Johnson should have said the United States has the highest ""corporate tax rate"" rather than the highest ""corporate taxes."" By using the term ""corporate taxes,"" Johnson opens the door to the broader World Bank figure, which would put a number of other major countries above the U.S. in the rankings.

That way of looking at it would undercut Johnson’s argument. On the other hand, he is close to correct when using the two more common benchmarks -- statutory tax rates (in which the U.S. trails only Japan, for now) and effective rates (where the U.S. trails only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand). On balance, we rate Johnson’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBE14C0>],/factchecks/2011/may/06/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-says-us-has-highest-corporate-income-/

Think we have it tough? In Africa, people walk up to 300 miles to vote, GOP senator says
","
Republicans and Democrats in the Florida Senate argued on May 5, 2011, over the purpose of a major elections overhaul, with Democrats saying the bill will suppress votes and Republicans countering that it will help prevent fraud.

HB 1355, which passed both chambers and now heads to the desk of Gov. Rick Scott, eliminates a four-decade-old provision that allows voters who have moved or changed their last name to update their information at the polls on Election Day. Those voters would have to file provisional ballots that are reviewed after the election. The bill also requires third-party groups like the League of Women Voters to register with the state and to turn in signed voter registration forms within 48 hours instead of the current 10 days.

Democrats argued the changes make voting harder.

Sen. Mike Bennett, R-Bradenton, said that's okay. Florida has made voting too easy, he said during debate, and people should be required to make an effort to cast a ballot. ""We all want everybody to vote,"" he said. ""But we want an informed voter.""

Voting is a privilege, Bennett said, so how easy should it be?

""Do you read the stories about the people in Africa? The people in the desert, who literally walk two and three hundred miles so they can have the opportunity to do what we do, and we want to make it more convenient? How much more convenient do you want to make it? Do we want to go to their house? Take the polling booth with us?

""This is a hard-fought privilege. This is something people die for. You want to make it convenient? The guy who died to give you that right, it was not convenient. Why would we make it any easier? I want 'em to fight for it. I want 'em to know what it's like. I want them to go down there, and have to walk across town to go over and vote.""

Do people in Africa really walk 200 to 300 miles to vote?

To put that in perspective, we're talking about walking the distance between Tallahassee and Biloxi, Miss., on Interstate 10, or the distance from Miami to Daytona Beach along I-95.

We didn't have to go too far to find an answer.

A group of African elections experts and officials happened to be in Gainesville May 1-10 learning about the American elections process. We were able to get them on the phone with the help of University of Florida political science professor Daniel A. Smith.

Through a Department of State translator, we asked each of them if people walk 200 to 300 miles in order to vote in Africa. We didn't have to wait for the translation...we heard the laughter.

""A maximum of two kilometers,"" said Mr. Alpha Faye, a teacher of history and geology in Senegal and an elections observer. (Two kilometers is about 1.25 miles).

Ms. Khadijetou Sall, a Mauritanian social worker and elections monitor, said that just like the United States, her country uses public facilities as polling places -- schools, medical clinics, other facilities in local villages. Ms. Mehla Ahmed Talebna, also of Mauritania, said that major parties also provide transportation for voters to make it to the polls, a practice also common in the United States.

""No question, no one walks through the desert to vote,"" Talebna said.

In Chad, a landlocked country with huge deserts in the north, the maximum distance you might have to walk is 5 kilometers (about 3.1 miles), added Mr. Baidessou Soukolgue, a program officer at the Chad office of the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy.

In Niger, it's up to 4 to 5 kilometers to a polling place or about 3 miles, said Mr. Abdoulaye Issoufou. ""It is more difficult to vote here than in Niger,"" Issoufou said. Elections officials even have plans for the country's nomads -- who move with their cattle to find water and land for grazing.

None of the African elections officials we spoke with heard of any case of someone walking 200 to 300 miles to vote. In fact, they wanted to know where Bennett got his information from. We would, too. We searched news accounts of the recent elections in Chad, Uganda, Nigeria and elsewhere and found no instance of people walking hundreds of miles in order to vote.

No doubt about it: This claim is Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDDF0B40>],/factchecks/2011/may/06/mike-bennett/think-we-have-it-tough-africa-people-walk-300-mile/
"['Bipartisanship', 'Campaign Finance', 'Candidate Biography', 'Elections', 'Wisconsin', 'Herb Kohl']","
Sen. Herb Kohl says he’s never done any negative campaigning
","
Twenty-three years into his Senate tenure, Wisconsin’s Herb Kohl hasn’t announced whether he will seek another six-year term in 2012.

But as Republicans step up their criticism of him, Kohl is making crystal clear his disdain for the kind of rough-and-tumble campaign environment that almost surely would be part of another campaign.

Compared to his last couple races when Kohl used his massive personal fortune to vanquish underfunded opponents with soft-sell TV ads, it would be a new environment for the senator who owns the Milwaukee Bucks and built the Kohl’s department and grocery store chains.

In remarks to reporters in Madison on April 28, 2011, Kohl ruminated about the state of today’s campaigns. He said ""people don’t like anybody in public life"" because of ""venomous"" attacks and sniping among congressional members, something he said he engages in ""hardly at all.""

Then he got specific: ""I’ve been through four campaigns and have not done any negative campaigning. And I don’t get into any personal jousts with other people in public life. But that’s just my style.""

So has Kohl really avoided any negative campaigning?

That’s quite a claim in this age of mud-slinging and aggressive campaign tactics. We decided to check it out.

Of course, it would be impossible to track down every campaign statement Kohl made since 1988 and copies of decades-old TV ads. So we focused our look-back to media descriptions of TV ads, debates and the candidates’ strategies in his four races. We also talked to the people who should know best: several of his former opponents or their aides, Kohl’s campaign staff, and a longtime political reporter.

Kohl has of course benefited from negative attacks launched by groups supporting his campaigns, but he spoke only of his own campaigns’ conduct, so we’ll limit our review to that.

One more note before we begin: Because there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes ""negative"" campaigning, we asked Team Kohl what exactly he meant by his claim.

""Sen. Kohl has said that he believes campaigning is about telling the people of Wisconsin what he’s done and what he plans to do, not tearing down his opponent or telling people not to vote for them,"" Kohl press secretary Lynn Becker said. ""He has not been deliberately malicious or factually dishonest in his campaigns or while serving in public office.""

Indeed, his two most recent opponents said there was no negative campaigning in their contests -- and had high praise for Kohl.

""He never did anything negative in his campaign. He’ll have the job as long as he wants the job,"" said John Gillespie, founder of Rawhide Boys Ranch, who lost to Kohl in 2000.

""Say hi to Herb if you talk to him. Tell him I owe him a dinner,"" said Robert Lorge, Kohl’s 2006 rival.

Fair enough. Those were landslide wins.

What about the earlier contests?

1988: Kohl was a surprise entrant in the Democratic primary, winning the nomination comfortably over former Gov. Tony Earl, Ed Garvey and Doug La Follette. He frustrated his rivalsby limiting his debate participation and spending millions on TV ads.

At the time, Earl’s media consultant David Axelrod charged that Kohl’s popular slogan -- ""Nobody’s Senator But Yours"" -- was an implicit negative attack. It implied that candidates who -- unlike Kohl -- have to raise most of their campaign money are beholden to donors, said Axelrod, who later went on to help a guy named Barack Obama get elected president.

Earl attacked Kohl as uninformed and error-prone, prompting Kohl campaign aide Bill Christofferson to call Earl ""desperate"" and guilty of misrepresentation.

Insiders on both sides agree that Kohl ran no attack ads in the primary -- and none in the very tight general election that saw Republican state legislator Susan Engeleiter close the gap to just a few pointswith a series of ads targeting Kohl in the closing weeks.

Engeleiter herself told us she has ""nothing but positive recollections"" of a ""pretty cordial campaign."" She also praised Kohl’s dealing with her when she later was confirmed as administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration.

La Follette and Garvey say today that they wouldn’t call Kohl’s primary race negative. Regarding Kohl’s slogan, La Follette agreed with Kohl aide Christofferson, who said:  ""Herb Kohl was talking about himself, not anyone else, when he promised to be 'nobody's senator but yours.'""

Indeed, Kohl explicitly used his positive campaign ads as a selling point, and called his victory a blow against negative campaigning.

1994: In his first re-election campaign, Kohl wasted little time aggressively portraying Republican opponent Robert Welch, a state lawmaker from Redgranite, as an ""extreme conservative"" and flip-flopper. At an early debate, he cited Welch’s no-exceptions stance against abortion and his vow never to vote for a tax hike as ""extreme."" According to media accounts, he did not explain the flip-flop charge.

Afterwards, Welch told reporters Kohl was ""nastier than I expected.""

Later, after Welch attempted to tie Kohl to President Clinton, Kohl launched a rare TV ad that focused on an opponent by name. Another followed. The ads accused Welch of distorting Kohl’s record. One said that ""fellow Republicans"" had criticized Welch’s tactics -- something deemed misleading in a Milwaukee Journal fact check.

The exchange led Welch to accuse Kohl of running a ""multimillion dollar mudslinging campaign."" Kohl said it was Welch who went negative.

The rhetoric heated up. At one point in the race, after Welch accused Kohl of ""religion bashing,"" Kohl spokesman Jeffrey Gillis said that "" Welch's attack again shows that he'll say or do anything to get elected.""

So, that seems like quite a bit of snarling.

Looking back, though, Welch’s campaign manager Mike Maxwell doesn’t have strong opinions about the back and forth.

""I don’t know that Kohl was particularly negative through that election,"" he told us. He didn’t recall the ""distort"" ad that Kohl ran. He did say that some might consider the ""extreme"" charge a negative attack.

Kohl, Maxwell recalled, ""just had overwhelming resources and then he signed (Bucks first round draft choice Glenn Robinson) six days before the election."" (We could not reach Welch for comment).

Kenneth Lamke, a Milwaukee Sentinel reporter who covered the 1994 race, offered the strongest opinion we heard on whether Kohl went negative against Welch. He says yes.

Lamke said the ""extreme"" charge by Kohl was ""within bounds but uncharacteristic of Herb."" Lamke viewed the attack as unprovoked and an exaggeration; Gillis, the Kohl aide, said it was a response to the drumbeat of criticism of Kohl during the Republican primary. Lamke, we should note, asked us to describe his personal politics as ""leans Republican.""

We asked several political scientists to characterize the language of the Kohl ad. They reacted cautiously because we could not provide the ad itself, just direct quotes from it in media accounts. That makes it impossible to fully judge the tone. 
Vanderbilt professor John Geer, an author of a much-cited book on negative campaigning, said it sounded like a ""tame"" response ad -- ""not the kind of classic negative ad the public doesn’t like."" Darrell West, of the Brookings Institution, agreed. 
UW-Madison’s Ken Goldstein said Kohl’s ad met the academic research definition of ""negative"" because it focused on Welch, not Kohl. The test of whether it was unfair is whether it was accurate, he said. 
So Kohl’s campaigns have been remarkably low-confrontation affairs, with the most notable exception being 1994, the first -- and perhaps only -- time Kohl aired TV spots going after an opponent.

So how does Kohl fare on his statement that he has never campaigned negatively?

Clearly, Kohl has spent the vast bulk of his time and money on upbeat, positive ads. Even his opponents agree strongly with that -- one even wants to buy him dinner.

The only ad that pops up as arguably negative is the 1994 ""distort"" spot against Welch. It drew some critical attention, but is viewed as a pretty tame response ad. Beyond that, Kohl’s campaigns have engaged in some labeling and name calling. And Kohl’s aggressive 1994 portrayal of Welch as an ""extremist"" was arguably negative.

Kohl is mostly on target here, with some minor exceptions.

Rep. Scott says 12 percent of high schools produce half of nation's dropouts
","
U.S. Rep Bobby Scott cited a staggering statistic when he announced he was introducing a measure to curb the high school dropout rate.

""Nearly 2,000 high schools - roughly 12 percent of all secondary schools in the United States - produce about half of the nation’s dropouts,"" Scott, D-3rd, said in an April 7 news release.

Is it true that such a small percentage of the nation’s high schools have such a large impact on the country’s dropout problem?

Scott’s office directed us to a 2007 report by Robert Balfanz, co-director of the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University and a widely quoted expert on the dropout issue.

Based on 2006 data, the report classified 1,999 high schools across the nation as ""low performing."" Balfanz said these schools, representing about 14 percent of the nation’s regular and vocational high schools enrolling 100 or more students, reliably produced 50 percent of America’s dropouts. He dubbed them dubbed ""dropout factories.""

An even greater share of the nation’s minority dropouts came from these schools: 81 percent of Native Americans; 73 percent of African-Americans and 66 percent of Latinos. They were attended by 34 percent of the white dropouts.

Scott accurately characterized the numbers in the report. But the study is several years old and we wanted to take an updated look.

Balfanz re-examined the issue with other researchers in a 2010 report titled ""Building a Grad Nation."" Using U.S. Department of Education figures, the authors found the number of the country’s worst-performing schools had fallen from 2,007 in 2002 to 1,746 in 2008.

The study was co-sponsored by the America’s Promise Alliance. Co-founded by retired Army General and Secretary of State Colin Powell, the non-profit group has proposed a ""Civic Marshall Plan"" to increase the number of students completing high school.

A March 2011 update of the ""Building a Grad Nation"" study found that in 2009, the latest year statistics are available, the number of dropout factories fell yet again to 1,634.

Those 1,634 low-performing schools represent about 10 to 12 percent of the nation’s high schools and still produce about half of the nation’s drop outs, said Colleen Wilber, a spokeswoman for the America’s Promise Alliance.

Every state has at least one ""dropout factory,"" which Balfanz defines as a school in which at least 40 percent of freshmen fail to make it to their senior year. For high schools that only have grades 10-12, his reports examine how sophomore year enrollment compares to the senior year.

The reports do not identify any of the troubled schools by name. The largest number are in the South. Virginia had 29 of them in 2009, 25 in 2008, and 26 back in 2002.

Scott’s bill -- also introduced in the Senate by Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa -- would strengthen regulations developed in 2008 that require states to use the same formula in reporting high school graduation rates. It would set a national graduation rate goal of 90 percent. The national high school graduation was 74.9 percent in 2008, the last year data was available.

To sum up:

Scott said that nearly 2,000 high schools, about 12 percent of those in the U.S., produce half the nation’s dropouts.

He accurately cited a report based on 2006 data. An updated study found the number of low-performing schools dropped to 1,634 in 2009.  That does not diminish Scott’s point that a small percentage of high schools have an enormous impact on the nation’s dropout problem.

We rate Scott’s claim True.

David Wu highlights worries over Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal
","
Medicare is the federal program that provides health care to 46.5 million Americans (including 511,450 in Oregon) and remains one of the country’s most popular but expensive programs.

It’s also something less obvious - a potent political tool that candidates use often to help their chances. It’s especially true for embattled candidates looking for some medicine of their own.

Which leads us to Rep. David Wu, the incumbent Democrat from Oregon’s 1st district whose erratic behavior in the weeks before Election Day last year triggered the departure of several senior staffers and questions about his chances to win re-election in 2012.

In an April 21 press release, Wu warned that seniors in his district would face $6,000 in higher annual health care costs if a Republican budget proposal is passed. ""Amazingly, House Republicans think they can get away with plans to increase costs for Oregon seniors by $6,000, issuing health care vouchers in order to give millionaires another $200,000 in tax breaks,"" Wu says in his press release.

It’s an inflammatory statement designed to energize seniors and Medicare supporters to rally against the budget written by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. As a byproduct, Wu is also hoping that defeating the budget plan will bring votes his way in 2012. 
On May 5, 2011, senior Republicans conceded that a deal with Democrats on Medicare was virtually impossible. But let’s examine the math behind Wu's suggestion.

Ryan’s proposal aimed to balance the budget by cutting spending $5.8 trillion over 10 years, reforming taxes and restraining the growth of the most costly entitlement programs - Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

Right now, Medicare is a ""fee for service"" program, which means if you qualify for coverage the program will pay your health care provider for each procedure or visit. Ryan wanted instead a subsidy that will pay part - but probably not all - the cost of a person’s health care insurance.

""Beginning in 2022, all newly-eligible Medicare beneficiaries (i.e., individuals turning 65 as well as younger, disabled individuals becoming eligible for Medicare) would only have access to health coverage through private insurance plans, rather than through the current government-run Medicare program,"" an analysis in April by the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation said.

""Under the new premium support system … the government would make payments directly to private health plans on behalf of Medicare-eligible enrollees, rather than pay hospitals, physicians, and other medical providers directly for the services. …If the government payments to plans on behalf of enrollees were insufficient to cover premiums and/or other costs, beneficiaries would be responsible for additional costs,"" Kaiser says.

This is where Wu’s math comes in, with help from Kaiser and the Congressional Budget Office. Wu says the $6,000 higher cost per year is the difference between the amount of the federal voucher and the likely cost of health insurance purchased on the open market.

CBO says that the most generous $8,000 voucher provided by Ryan’s plan would cover 39 percent of the cost of the average private plan for a 65-year-old in 2022. Which means the plan actually costs about $20,500 and that beneficiaries would be on the hook for about $12,500 of the cost.

According to calculations by the CBO and Kaiser, a typical beneficiary would have to pay $6,150 out-of-pocket in 2022 if Medicare essentially remains the same as today. Under Ryan’s plan that out-of-pocket cost would have jumped to $12,500, which is an increase of $6,350.

Ryan argues that Wu and other critics, including President Barack Obama, do not take into account the effect millions of new customers flooding a market will have. He figures competition will lower prices as insurers battle to capture new business underwritten with government subsidies.

""Medicare is projected to go bankrupt in just nine years unless we act to curb the relentlessly rising cost of health care,"" Ryan wrote in an April 24 op-ed published by The Washington Post. ""This cannot be done with across-the-board cuts in Washington. It has to be done by giving seniors the tools to fight back against skyrocketing costs. That’s why our budget saves Medicare by using competition to weed out inefficient providers, improve the quality of health care for seniors and drive costs down.""

He and his allies also point out that Medicare costs are growing explosively and if not addressed the program will require deep cuts or higher out of pocket costs.

Regardless of the uncertainties, there is strong evidence that people who reach age 65 in 10 years and begin using Medicare would certainly pay more under Ryan’s plan than they would if they became eligible today.

Is the difference $6,000 or more? Could it be less? The answer to each is perhaps. But given current knowledge and calculations $6,000 is a number that can be defended. For that reason, we rate Wu’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC758E40>],/factchecks/2011/may/06/david-wu/david-wu-highlights-worries-over-paul-ryans-medica/

Kathie Tovo says one of Randi Shade's biggest donors is lobbyist for racetrack
","
Kathie Tovo, among challengers to Place 3 Austin City Council Member Randi Shade, says in at least two recent mailers sent to voters that despite a city budget crisis, the council might give $4 million a year for 10 years to subsidize a racetrack.

That’s referring to possible council action designating a portion of estimated city sales and use tax revenues to cover costs related to future Formula One races on the track planned southeast of Austin.

Here, we’re not delving into whether such spending would be a subsidy. We’re wondering about what Tovo adds in her mailers: ""And one of (Shade’s) biggest contributors is the racetrack lobbyist.""

Tovo’s campaign manager, Mark Yznaga, told us in a telephone interview the lobbyist is Richard Suttle, a partner in the influential Austin law firm, Armbrust & Brown.

Yznaga conceded that Suttle has personally given Shade’s campaign only $25, the maximum any lobbyist working City Hall can give per election. But, he said, lawyers and spouses connected to the Armbrust & Brown firm accounted for 51 firm-connected contributions, 45 for $350, six for $25, for a total $15,900 from late December through April 4, the end of the latest reporting period.

Nudged about Suttle’s tiny donation, Yznaga replied: ""You’re being silly. It’s quite well known in the city that (Suttle) is the lobbyist who does a lot of Armbrust & Brown work.""

Yznaga noted that 16 members of the firm, which lists 21 lawyers on its website, contributed the maximum allowed, $350. And he pointed out that David Armbrust, among the firm’s founders, is listed on Shade’s finance filings as a bundler, which the city defines as anyone who has solicited and obtained contributions for the candidate adding up to more than $5,000 during a finance reporting period. Armbrust, like Suttle a city-registered lobbyist, gave $25.

Suttle is a familiar figure at City Hall, where he frequently represents real estate developers. He has reported 55 clients to the city, including Circuit of the Americas, which is building the racetrack.

Next, we reached Suttle, who called the characterization of him as one of Shade’s biggest contributors ""a stretch. It’s old-school campaign lies."" The city ordinance limiting individuals who lobby the city to $25 donations means he couldn’t be a top donor.

""I have to chuckle,"" he said, adding that he told his wife, who also donated $25 to Shade’s campaign: ""I guess 50 bucks gets us on the big contributors list now.""

In a telephone interview, Shade’s campaign manager, Katherine Haenschen, pointed out that the money donated by the Suttles accounted for a minuscule share of more than $168,000 Shade raised from November through April 4.

She said by email: ""By my calculations, our average donation is $208. Suttle's $25 is
about 1/8 of that. Furthermore, the last time I checked, there are only 10 individuals who have donated LESS than Richard Suttle!""

That may be true. But donors connected to Armbrust & Brown accounted for 9 percent of Shade’s contributions through April 4. Shade’s finance reports show 9 bundlers other than Armbrust accounting for 15 percent of her campaign contributions through April 4. The next-most-successful single bundler raised about $6,300, less than half Armbrust’s haul for Shade.

Armbrust’s bundling is surely appreciated by the incumbent and signals the firm’s lawyers, including Suttle, want her to win a second term. But Tovo overshoots when she spears the racetrack lobbyist. Other members of his law firm are responsible for sending far more money Shade’s way. We rate the claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE0B580>],/factchecks/2011/may/06/kathie-tovo/kathie-tovo-says-one-randi-shades-biggest-donors-l/

MARTA chair says transit system ""more and more safe""
","
A witness account of a recent attack on a MARTA train had the makings of a gritty TV drama.  

It took place just before midnight on a Saturday. The train car doors slid open at Garnett Station. A mob of teens streamed in, chanting the initials of a notorious Atlanta gang. 

The doors closed. There was nowhere to run. 

""There was blood everywhere. People were hollering and screaming,"" a rider told Channel 2 Action News. 

The April 16 attack left two Delta Air Lines employees with minor injuries. The witness account, criticized as sensational and inaccurate by MARTA officials, revived public anxiety over safety on the public transit system. 

New MARTA Board Chairman Jim Durrett tried to reassure the public during an April 28 interview with Denis O’Hayer on WABE-FM (90.1). 

""When you look at crime statistics, riding MARTA has been becoming more and more safe over the years,"" Durrett said. 

More and more safe? What about 14-year-old Rueben Hand III, whose throat was slashed New Year’s Day at Five Points Station? And chess champ Anthony Beavers, 19, who was shot to death during a robbery at the East Point station in March 2010?

Police made arrests in both slayings, as well as last month’s attack. 

Transit agency spokeswoman Cara Hodgson referred PolitiFact Georgia to crime statistics on the MARTA website. She also sent us a written statement that said, in part, that Durrett’s statement was ""unequivocally accurate and reasonable.""  

We took our own look at MARTA’s crime data. They tell a more nuanced story. 

The transit system is policed by the MARTA Police Department, a full-service, nationally accredited law enforcement agency with about 300 sworn personnel, its own criminal investigations unit, and an emergency call center. It’s responsible for law enforcement at MARTA’s buildings, stations, trains, buses and vans.  

MARTA police sends its crime statistics to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which publishes them each year. The most recent data is from 2009. 

Durrett did not specify during his WABE interview the years he thinks the transit system became safer. The data Hodgson referenced covered four years. Since the FBI’s data was more comprehensive, we used that agency’s numbers. 

Crime on the transit system is rare, according to FBI statistics on ""Part I"" crime, a category of serious offenses such as murder, rape, robbery, larceny and burglary that are more commonly reported to police. 

And overall, crime on MARTA is dropping, the data shows. Part I offenses are down a whopping 42 percent during the past decade, from 752 incidents to 438. This decline was led by a drop in nonviolent property crimes, which are by far the most common type.  

But violent crime rose 8percent to 163 incidents from 2000 to 2009. The increase was led by a 26 percent climb in aggravated assaults to 96 attacks. Murder and rapes generally held steady while robbery declined. 

Violent attacks increased even as MARTA ridership dipped by 6 percent to less than 157 million unlinked trips, or passenger boardings, according to federal statistics. 

The increase in violent crime is more dramatic over a five-year period. Those offenses increased by 36 percent from 2005 through 2009, led by a 27 percent jump in robbery and 41 percent increase in aggravated assault. This took place as ridership climbed by 10 percent.  

So do statistics show riding MARTA has become ""more and more safe,"" as Chairman Durrett said? 

People on MARTA are less likely to be victims of crime than they were 10 years ago. This is especially true for property crimes. Riders are much less likely to have their wallets swiped. 

Still, they are somewhat more likely to get violently attacked.

Durrett’s remark did not give this factor the weight it deserves. For this reason, he earns a Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA9A2C0>],/factchecks/2011/may/06/jim-durrett/marta-chair-says-transit-system-more-and-more-safe/

Rep. Ucci says requiring banks to have outside security cameras would deter robberies
","
On the morning of Sept. 20, 2010,  a 49-year-old service station manager brought a deposit bag with $12,542 to a Citizen Bank branch in Woonsocket. A man in a ski mask confronted him outside the bank and demanded the money.

When David Main tried to run away, the robber fatally shot him outside the bank entrance and ran off. Three accomplices have since been indicted for the crime.

Now state Rep. Stephen Ucci is sponsoring legislation that would require all banks to ""maintain security video cameras covering all customer doors, automatic teller machines, and night deposit repositories.""

""If that bank had been required to install security cameras outside of its building years ago, the victim may still be alive today,"" Ucci said in a statement. ""A robber’s primary goal is to get in and out of the bank or ATM as quickly as possible without being recognized. A surveillance camera capturing a criminal’s face and other identifiable traits would certainly discourage robbery attempts and serve as a deterrent to robbers.""

The killing of Main, a father and husband, provoked outrage and calls for the death penalty.

Ucci told us he submitted his legislation after talking to Main’s employer, who told him about the killing. He said the police did not ask him to pursue the bill and that he did not research the subject.

While we understand his motivation, we wondered: does video surveillance deter robberies at banks?

We often see surveillance images of robbers -- some disguised, some not -- who clearly were not deterred by cameras prominently placed in banks.

So we searched for some evidence.

For starters, we learned that nationwide, 5,628 bank robberies (including a very small number of larcenies and burglaries) were reported in 2010 to the FBI. Loot was taken more than 90 percent of the time. The crimes resulted in 106 injuries and 16 deaths.

Of the banks that were targeted in these cases, 5,543, or 98 percent, had some form of video surveillance.

That’s quite a few robbers unfazed by video surveillance. Did plenty of others refrain from robbing banks because of video cameras? No study shows that, as far as we know.

We did find one enlightening report, written by Deborah Lamm Weisel, director of police research in the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at North Carolina State University. Her 2007 text on bank robbery was created for the non-profit Center for Problem-Oriented Policing and appears on the U.S. Department of Justice’s web site.

Weisel notes that the number of incidences has increased dramatically since the 1960s, as banks expanded hours and branches.

""Bank robberies are usually fast, low-risk crimes, because employees are trained to comply with a robber’s demands,"" she writes.

When listing measures that heighten a robber’s ""perception of risk,"" she mentions hiring security guards, assigning employees to greet customers and enforcing policies prohibiting caps and sunglasses inside the bank. She did not include electronic surveillance.

""Cameras do not appear to reduce robberies. Many bank robbers are not deterred because they simply do not believe they will be caught. Others believe that cameras can be thwarted with a disguise or by covert behavior or that cameras can be disabled such as with spray paint; or they simply do not think about cameras at all,"" Weisel writes.

Surveillance, she said, helps  ""in identifying and apprehending suspects and can aid in prosecution as well. ""

Douglas Johnson, vice president of risk management policy at the American Bankers Association, agreed.

""I’ve always heard and believed that cameras are not a deterrent measure. Cameras and video are there specifically for apprehension purposes,"" he said.

Cameras are already at all ATMs, he noted, and do not prevent ATM crime.  

William Farrell, legislative council to the Rhode Island Bankers Association, testified against  Ucci’s bill at the State House because of civil liberty concerns and other issues. When interviewed, he said that industry experts don’t view surveillance as an ""effective tool in terms of deterrence.""

We did find a 2009 article, in which representatives of The Security Executive Council, a risk mitigation research and services organization, wrote that ""parking lot cameras … could help identify perpetrators before they put their masks on. They could also act as a deterrent."" But the authors emphasize apprehension, adding only that such video surveillance ""could also"" serve as a deterrent.

When we told Ucci our findings, he said his intent was not just to prevent robberies of banks, but of customers, too. Exterior surveillance could deter robbers from attacking customers outside, he said, as well as provide information about a robber’s identity and getaway.

Ucci, no doubt, sincerely wants to prevent another tragic death like David Main’s. And police officials in Providence and Woonsocket told us that video surveillance certainly helps catch and send robbers to prison, preventing repeat offenders from robbing again.

But we couldn’t find any evidence that outdoor surveillance deters robberies of customers.
And the experts we consulted doubt its deterrence value.

We rate Ucci’s claim False.
