Nancy Pelosi correct that renewing kids' health program saves money
","As a federal government shutdown loomed, lawmakers discussed whether to fold the reauthorization of a popular children’s health plan into a final legislative bargain. At her weekly press conference, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made the case for reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, for as long as possible. CHIP provides health coverage to certain low-income children and pregnant women whose family income levels are above the threshold to obtain Medicaid coverage. It is funded jointly by the federal government and the states. In 2016, CHIP served 8.9 million beneficiaries. The reauthorization ""should have been done in September, first of all,"" Pelosi said in her Jan. 18, 2018. ""Second of all, we wanted 10 years … which, by the way, saves $6 billion."" Republicans, she added, rejected a 10-year reauthorization. ""Doing it for six years saves $1 billion. That's good,"" she said. ""Doing it 10 years, saving $6 billion is better. In fact, it's best."" A few days later, after government funding had lapsed, lawmakers decided to include a six-year CHIP reauthorization in the bill that reopened the government. We were struck by Pelosi’s claim that a federal program to provide health coverage for 8.9 million children and pregnant women could actually save the government money, rather than costing it. So we took a closer look. When we contacted Pelosi’s staff, they pointed us to a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the pending reauthorization bill that had been released the previous day, Jan. 17. CBO is Congress’ nonpartisan arbiter of projected costs of legislation. CBO said that a six-year CHIP reauthorization would produce an additional $8.204 billion in revenue, but only $7.223 billion in additional costs. That means a cumulative savings of $981 million, or nearly $1 billion. (It’s in the chart on page 4 here.) As for a 10-year reauthorization, Pelosi’s office pointed us to a Jan. 11, 2018, CBO analysis. The report projected a 10-year reauthorization ""would decrease the deficit by $6 billion over the 2018-2027 period."" So Pelosi was correct on the numbers. The broader question: Why does CHIP save the government money? In short, it’s because the alternatives cost more. According to CBO, ""extending funding for CHIP for 10 years yields net savings to the federal government because the federal costs of the alternatives to providing coverage through CHIP (primarily Medicaid, subsidized coverage in the marketplaces, and employment-based insurance) are larger than the costs of providing coverage through CHIP during that period."" ""It’s a very popular program across party lines, and the CBO score had it saving money,"" said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studies health care policy. Our ruling Pelosi said that reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program ""for six years saves $1 billion"" and that doing it for 10 years saves $6 billion. CBO analyses back up Pelosi’s numbers. Because the reauthorization of CHIP would essentially take the place of more expensive programs, doing so would eventually net savings for the government.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Stacey Abrams']","
Did Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate protect college aid program?
","Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has taken some heat for co-sponsoring a 2011 bill to revamp the HOPE higher education aid program. Critics of the former House minority leader say she cut a deal that hurt poor and minority students. The Abrams campaign rejected the charge. ""Under Abrams’ leadership, Democrats fought to prevent certain cuts and make sure the bill included funding for remedial classes at technical colleges, a 1 percent low interest loan program, and prevented the use of ACT/SAT testing standards that would have harmed poor students and students of color,"" spokeswoman Caitlin Highland wrote in an email Jan. 17. A key point of contention centers on the role of standardized test scores in the aid program. In this fact-check, we looked at whether Abrams prevented the use of ACT/SAT testing standards in setting eligibility for scholarships. HOPE stands for Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally and dates from 1992. It was one of the country’s earliest merit-based state aid programs. Over the years, it reached hundreds of thousands of students and provided billions of dollars in assistance. Until 2011, it had two basic streams: HOPE grants defrayed costs for attending technical colleges, and HOPE scholarships covered the full-tuition, plus books and other fees, for people working on two-year associate’s and four-year bachelor’s degrees. In 2011, costs were outstripping proceeds from the Georgia state lottery that funded the program. The state’s newly elected governor, Republican Nathan Deal, moved to trim the spending. In February 2011, flanked by lawmakers including Abrams, Deal unveiled a plan for HOPE. Among its many measures, it created two tiers in the scholarship awards part of the HOPE program – one for the best students and one for good but not exceptional ones. The original full-tuition HOPE scholarship was renamed the Zell Miller scholarship in honor of the former U.S. senator and governor. It significantly racheted up the eligibility requirements. Aimed at high performers, the Zell Miller scholarship program was limited to students with a 3.7 grade point average and a combined score of at least 1200 for the critical reading and math sections on the SAT or a 26 ACT score. The original HOPE scholarship remained in name, but the bill made it less generous. Instead of full tuition, it provided support that approached 90 percent of tuition, and it no longer covered books and other costs. Unlike the Zell Miller award for elite scholars, the HOPE scholarship remained free of a standardized test score requirement. As before, students were eligible if they had at least a 3.0 grade point average. Did Abrams actually save the HOPE scholarship program from a standardized test requirement? Abrams’ communications director Priyanka Mantha told us Abrams did. ""The original Republican proposal sought to impose testing requirements on students who wished to receive the scholarship, in order to narrow eligibility,"" Mantha said. ""But under her leadership, the scholarship retained an eligibility tier without testing requirements because such tests would have disproportionately disqualified low-income students and students of color."" There is no hard data on the discussions that took place behind closed doors, but an Atlanta Journal Constitution article from that time said the test score idea was in play. The news report listed eight suggestions. One of them was ""require high school graduates to earn a minimum SAT/ACT score to be eligible."" Mantha said the creation of the Zell Miller scholarship with a test score requirement was the result of Abrams’ intervention. ""The two tiers of the HOPE program are the crux of the compromise she achieved,"" Mantha said. ""Students who may have been eliminated from eligibility under the GOP proposal instead retained access to a version of the HOPE scholarship."" Ben George, chief of staff to the Senate Minority Leader in 2011, said his boss and other Democrats were not part of the discussions and were ""caught completely off-guard"" by the deal with the governor. As part of the 2011 bill, lawmakers raised the grade average for the HOPE grant for technical colleges from 2.0 to 3.0. According to a report from the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning study center, full-time enrollment in the state’s technical college system fell ""nearly 25 percent between 2011 and 2012."" In 2013, lawmakers rolled back the hike in the grade average. Other changes, however, remained in place, including pulling back the amount of HOPE grant and scholarship aid. That made it harder for lower income students to stay enrolled. After the first two years, a Wall Street Journal analysis found that students from higher income neighborhoods went from being twice as likely to secure a full-tuition scholarship to three times as likely, compared to students from lower income neighborhoods. Georgia State University told the Journal that it had to drop dozens of students for not paying tuition after their scholarship aid dropped (although most of them were able to return after the school made a special plea to donors). Abrams said she led the fight to prevent the use of standardized test scores as part of the HOPE program. In 2011, she supported a plan to make minimum test scores part of the eligibility requirements for the full-tuition HOPE scholarship. The bill that emerged renamed the full-tuition scholarship, raised the minimum grade point average and added a minimum test score requirement. The bill did not add similar requirements to the original scholarship program, but made it less generous. Abrams’ statement is accurate but it leaves out important details. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809721C3C0>],/factchecks/2018/jan/24/stacey-abrams/georgia-governors-race-hope-scholarship-abrams/

But now dying of pancreatic cancer with one week left to live, the hitman wanted to come clean and told his story to the Fox News intern. The intern allegedly told The Patriot News that the hitman ""put three bullets in Vince Foster and two in Seth Rich. He tied up more loose ends than any other hitman in history."" Foster was the former White House counsel who committed suicide in 1993. Rich was the Democratic National Committee worker who was murdered in 2016.

"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'Jon Husted']","
Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted's tweets about close elections is accurate
","Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted often cites the number of elections with razor-thin margins when talking about his responsibility to maintain accurate voter rolls. ""When we say ‘one vote matters,’ it’s not just a saying – it has proven true 141 times in #Ohio over the last five years,"" Husted tweeted Jan. 3, linking to data about the 2017 elections. Husted has drawn national attention for the state’s longstanding policy of removing voters from the rolls who haven’t voted in recent years or confirmed their addresses, a policy challenged by the ACLU and other voting rights advocates. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the policy later this year. A spokesman for Husted sent us data showing the 141 elections that resulted in a tie vote or a one-vote difference between 2013 and 2017. That data proves Husted’s point, but we will explain it in more detail. Husted is running for lieutenant governor in the May 8 Republican primary for governor; he is the running mate of Mike DeWine, the current attorney general who is running for governor. Republican incumbent Gov. John Kasich is term limited. Husted’s data pertains to both local races for office as well as issue-oriented ballot questions. Issues and ballot questions require a majority vote in order to pass, so in the case of tie votes, the matter fails. In races determining local offices such as city council, in the case of tie votes, winners are determined by lot such as a coin toss or name draw. While the number of races that resulted in ties or were decided by one vote sounds like a lot in sheer numbers, it doesn’t add up to much when you consider that Ohio has a massive number of local elections in each cycle. In the November 2017 general election, there were 29 races that resulted in a tie or a one-vote difference. Statewide, there were about 1,500 local issues on topics such as a levy for cemeteries, road improvements, a fire contract and liquor laws. Some of these elections only drew hundreds of votes in various villages and townships. For example, a bond renewal in Charleston failed with a 41-41 tie. The Secretary of State’s office didn’t have the total number of all elections on the ballot, but in addition to the local issues, there were also local races for office and statewide issues. So while we don’t have data to calculate an exact percentage, it’s clear that the 29 races that Husted cited are only a fraction of a percentage of the total number of elections. Ohio State University assistant professor Vladimir Kogan, who studies state and local government, told PolitiFact that the one-vote threshold isn’t particularly meaningful or more important than other close races. Some people point to these close elections to justify voter ID laws, arguing that a single fraudulent vote could have decided an election, Kogan said. However, a single-vote election could just as well be decided by a voter ID law that keeps a single otherwise eligible voter from casting a ballot, he said. ""In other words, close elections increase the importance both of policies that reduce fraud but also of the potential implications of those policies for turnout,"" he said. Husted has cited the one-vote races as part of the justification for maintaining accurate voter rolls. ""When a single vote can have such a big impact in so many places, you can understand why we focus so heavily on accuracy of the voter rolls and the integrity of the elections process, and why we encourage every voter to take their right and responsibility to vote seriously,"" he said in 2013. He also cited the one-vote elections when he commented about his investigation that found 82 noncitizens who were alleged to have voted illegally in at least one election. ""Every vote matters, and any illegal vote can have an effect,"" he said in 2017. Husted tweeted ""When we say ‘one vote matters,’ it’s not just a saying – it has proven true 141 times in #Ohio over the last five years."" The tweet linked to a press release that said Husted was referring to races and local questions that resulted in tie votes or a difference of a single vote. Husted’s office provided data showing the 141 races for local office or local issue questions that were decided by that narrow margin between 2013 and 2017. Husted’s numbers are correct. However, we will note that races this close are very rare in the context of all the elections in Ohio.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Economy', 'Donald Trump']","
Do immigrants cost U.S. taxpayers $300 billion annually?
","President Donald Trump wants immigrants to come based on skills, not family ties, so he’s pushing to limit the number of relatives lawful permanent residents can petition to join them in the United States. A page on the White House website argues so-called ""chain migration"" is bad for the U.S. economy. ""There is general agreement amongst immigration experts that low-skilled migrants create a net fiscal deficit, creating more in government expenditures than they pay in taxes. According to one study, current immigration policy imposes as much as $300 billion annually in net fiscal costs on U.S. taxpayers,"" said one of the graphics posted Dec. 15. Graphic posted on WhiteHouse.gov The economic impact of immigration is widely debated, but PolitiFact decided to take a closer look at the $300 billion figure. Trump’s team highlighted a September 2016 Washington Times story headlined: ""Mass immigration costs government $296 billion a year, depresses wages."" It reported on a study from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on the economic and fiscal consequences of immigration. A consultant who contributed to the report told us that in 2013 the total fiscal burden -- average outlays minus average receipts multipled by 55.5 million individuals -- was $279 billion for the first generation of immigrants. But making a conclusion on that one figure is a mighty case of cherry-picking. The National Academies found that first-generation immigrants (who were born outside of the United States) cost governments more money than the native-born population. The costs are largely taken on by state and local governments that educate the immigrants’ children. But members of the second generation ""are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the U.S. population,"" the report said, with tax contributions greater than their parents and the native-born population. In the long term, the immigrant impact is ""generally positive"" at the federal level but remains negative at state and local levels, varying significantly across states. ""To characterize that one number as the cost to current native-born taxpayers, is absolutely a case of cherry-picking one result out of a very detailed report,"" said Gretchen Donehower, an academic specialist at the University of California at Berkeley and consultant who contributed to the report. Donehower gave us three caveats to the White House’s message: The government runs on a deficit, so on average, taxpayers, including the native-born, benefit more than they pay in taxes. While members of the first, second, and third generations on average all cost more than they pay, we are all pushing a substantial amount of debt onto future generations — and immigrants and their descendants will also be ""on the hook"" for that debt. Some costs won’t go away even if immigrants do. If all of the first-generation immigrants suddenly left the country, the government wouldn’t immediately have its expense burden reduced by $279 billion. Calculations in the study included defense costs and interest on the existing public debt, which would not go down without the 55.5 million immigrants. If those costs were excluded, the total fiscal burden for the first generation and dependents would go down to $43 billion, and the per capita burden would be more for the native-born population than for the first-generation immigrants. The overall effect of immigration on economic growth was positive. Whatever costs immigrants might present now will be ""paid back"" by overall economic growth that will lead to more tax revenue on average for the government and less demand for need-based benefit programs. ""The $279 billion calculation does not include any estimate of this effect and so is an upper bound on total fiscal impact,"" Donehower said. The study analyzed fiscal impacts using assumptions under different scenarios, which led to varying outcomes, said Chris Mackie, a study director with the Committee on National Statistics at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The $279 billion impact stems from the combination of worst-case assumptions, he said. Under other assumptions, the fiscal burden was $43 billion. The point is that these numbers are estimates and depend on various factors, including immigrants’ age, education and timeframe examined. The study also said the historical record suggests that the total net fiscal impact of immigrants across all levels of government has become more positive over time. ""The evidence does not suggest that current immigrant flows cost native-born taxpayers money over the long-run nor does it provide support for the notion that lowering immigration quotas or stepping up enforcement of existing immigration laws would generate savings to existing taxpayers,"" said a post on Econofact co-authored by Donehower and Francine Blau, an economics professor at Cornell University who chaired the panel that released the report. The claim from the White House shows ""a pretty misleading reading of the study,"" said Margaret Peters, an assistant professor of political science at the University of California-Los Angeles. ""While the first generation does impose fiscal costs, those costs are more than made up for at the federal level by the second generation (the children of immigrants),"" Peters said. ""On the state level, it is true that immigrants impose more of a burden in large part because they have children who go to school and states don't always recoup the costs of schooling."" David Dyssegaard Kallick, director of immigration research at the Fiscal Policy Institute, said, ""This is just sophistry."" Since the United States has been running a deficit for years, ""by definition, all Americans have a bigger net cost than contribution — first-generation immigrants, second-generation immigrants, and those of us who have been here for three or more generations,"" he said. ""That’s a failure of tax policy, not a story about immigrants."" The White House claimed that ""current immigration policy imposes as much as $300 billion annually in net fiscal costs on U.S. taxpayers."" A study from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine analyzed the fiscal impact of immigration under different scenarios. Under some assumptions, the fiscal burden was $279 billion, but $43 billion in other scenarios. The report also found that U.S.-born children with at least one foreign-born parent are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors, thanks in part to the spending by local governments on their education. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz says he's opposed shutdowns, but he hasn't always
","With an end to the federal government shutdown in sight, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tried to argue that, contrary to popular belief, he was not the driving force behind the previous government shutdown in 2013. Back in 2013, Cruz -- then a junior member of the Senate’s minority party -- had tried to end funding for the Affordable Care Act. He pushed for language to defund Obamacare in spending bills, which would have forced then-President Barack Obama to choose between keeping the government open and crippling his signature legislative achievement. As the high-stakes legislative game played out, Obama and his fellow Democrats refused to agree to gut the law, and the Republicans, as a minority party, didn’t have the numbers to force their will. Following a 16-day shutdown, lawmakers voted to fund both the government and the Affordable Care Act. Cruz was widely identified at the time as the leader of the defunding effort. Most famously, Cruz spoke about defunding Obamacare on the Senate floor during a 21-hour speech, punctuated by Green Eggs and Ham as a bedtime story for his children. Many in Cruz’s own party, even those sympathetic with his goals, blamed him for a tactical blunder. During the spending impasse, his Republican colleagues launched ""a barrage of hostile questions"" at a GOP-only lunch, questioning whether Cruz had thought through the endgame. By the time Cruz was running for president in 2016, some Republicans were willing to criticize his approach publicly. Grover Norquist, an influential anti-tax activist, told the Washington Post in 2016 that Cruz’s shutdown plan was like a plotline in TV’s South Park in which a group of gnomes comes up with a nonsense plot to become rich. Josh Holmes, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told the Post that Cruz’s approach was ""like a toddler’s version of legislating."" Leading up to the 2018 shutdown, Cruz’s role in the 2013 budget impasse received fresh media coverage, since he was now in the Senate majority. Would he be able to reconcile his past tactics with his current urgings not to shut down the government? This came to a head during a Senate hallway exchange between Cruz and reporter Kasie Hunt that aired on MSNBC on Jan. 22, 2018: Cruz: ""We should not be shutting the government down. I have consistently opposed shutdowns. In 2013, I said we shouldn't shut the government down. Indeed, I went to the Senate floor repeatedly asking unanimous consent to reopen the government."" Hunt: ""Sir, you stood in the way of that."" Cruz: ""That's factually incorrect. It's a wonderful media narrative, but only one thing causes a shutdown: when you have senators vote to deny cloture on a funding bill. And when that bill comes up, you have a vote. A yes means fund the government, a no means don't fund the government. In 2013, virtually every single Republican voted to fund the government, including me multiple times. In fact, every single Democrat I believe in 2013 voted to shut the government down. The same thing is true here. Virtually every single Republican voted this week to fund the government. Virtually every single Democrat voted to shut it down."" Hunt: ""Sir, that's simply not the case. This was about Obamacare funding…"" Cruz: ""Those facts are incorrect. ... I get that you want to debate me, but you don't actually have any facts."" Cruz’s argument that he didn’t cause a shutdown is one he and his camp has made in the past. In his 2015 book, A Time for Truth, Cruz wrote that neither he nor his ally, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, ""nor the House Republicans even once voted to shut down the government. To the contrary, over and over again we voted to fund the government."" And in the 2016 Post article, then-Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said the senator ""didn’t pursue a government shutdown strategy. That’s not even sane. That would be a good thing to go out and campaign on? That wasn’t what he did. He led the fight to defund Obamacare."" This echoes the framing Cruz offered Hunt -- namely, that his motivation was not to keep the government from being funded, but rather to defund Obamacare, and that the only reason people believe this is because of the biased media. However, even if, for the sake of argument, you accept Cruz’s line of thinking, his hallway comments offered a very specific definition of determining whether a lawmaker had ""consistently opposed shutdowns."" Specifically, Cruz said that ""only one thing causes a shutdown: when you have senators vote to deny cloture on a funding bill."" Cloture refers to a Senate vote to cut off debate and proceed to a bill; it’s a prerequisite for considering a bill, and these days, it typically takes 60 votes. So did Cruz ever ""vote to deny cloture on a funding bill""? He did. It came on the legislation to end the 16-day shutdown -- a bill that didn’t include the Obamacare defunding language that he had been seeking. If this spending bill didn’t pass, the government wouldn’t be funded and would have to remain closed. As it happened, the bill passed by a large bipartisan majority, but Cruz was one of 16 senators to vote against cloture. He was also one of 18 to vote against the bill itself. By doing the ""one thing"" that he himself said defines causing a shutdown, Cruz didn't ""consistently oppose shutdowns."" ""When he knew everyone else would vote to end the shutdown, he voted against funding the government,"" said Josh Ryan, a political scientist at Utah State University and author of the forthcoming book The Lawmaking End Game: Bargaining and Resolution in Congress. Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told PolitiFact that his ""goal was to defund Obamacare, not shut down the government, and that is the point he was making today. He voted several times and fought in the face of (Democratic) opposition to fund vital government services -- including the military, veterans benefits, the National Guard, and National Health Institute -- while working to defund Obamacare before it went into effect, at which point he knew it would be markedly more difficult to undo. Sen. Cruz voted against cloture on the final bill because it still funded Obamacare, and he was committed to continuing the debate to defund it, while supporting bills to fund the other functions of government not impacted by Obamacare."" Cruz said, ""I have consistently opposed shutdowns."" Debunking this assertion doesn’t even require leveraging the many Republican statements criticizing Cruz’s legislative tactics for prompting the 2013 government shutdown. It only requires using the standard Cruz laid out in the same interview -- that ""only one thing causes a shutdown: when you have senators vote to deny cloture on a funding bill."" Cruz did that very thing in 2013, when he was one of 16 senators to vote against cloture for the spending bill that would go on to end the shutdown. He was also one of 18 senators to vote against the bill itself.

"['Immigration', 'Homeland Security', 'Texas', 'Paul Sperry']","
Commentator: El Paso fencing in 2010 drove down violent crime, illegal crossings and drug smuggling
","Conservative Paul Sperry highlighted fencing erected near El Paso a decade ago as evidence that President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall could enhance security. Sperry wrote in a January 2018 New York Post commentary that the fencing, described as completed in 2010, explains a dramatic decrease in violent crime in the West Texas city and plummets in illegal crossings and drug smuggling. We wondered about that after Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, promoted Sperry’s commentary on Twitter and Bob Moore, former executive editor of the El Paso Times, asserted in his own tweet that El Paso had low violent crime rates as far back as 2005 while illegal border crossings, Moore wrote, decreased for varied reasons around 2010 including the Great Recession. Sperry, whom we emailed without hearing back, wrote that once the fencing went up, illegal crossings and levels of violent crime and drug smuggling rapidly subsided and that since then, El Paso has consistently topped rankings for cities of 500,000 residents or more with low crime rates, based on FBI-collected statistics. We'd suggest that claims about any city’s safety rank be considered with caution. Such rankings are oft tied to FBI statistics that the agency counsels against using to rank or compare communities. We’ve also done several separate fact-checks noting flaws in claims about El Paso’s safety standing. On another front, it appears the fencing touted by Sperry was not finished in 2010. Ramiro Cordero, a spokesman for the Border Patrol’s El Paso sector, which takes in New Mexico, El Paso County and part of adjoining Hudspeth County, advised by email that from 2007 to approximately 2014, two types of fencing got built near the El Paso metro area: double-layered mesh 18 feet tall and mesh on movable barriers going up 22 feet. In 2009, David Aguilar of the Border Patrol specified at a U.S. Senate hearing that 626 miles of congressionally ordered fencing had been completed along the border. When fully built, Aguilar said, the additions would cover 661 miles from Texas into California, counting 115 miles each in New Mexico and Texas. Decreased ‘illegal alien’ apprehensions We explored each part of Sperry’s statement separately, starting with whether the new fencing greatly diminished border crossings. All along the southwestern border, it’s worth noting, apprehensions by the Border Patrol peaked in 2000 at 1.6 million (yearly total) and later generally declined starting around the time of the 2008-09 recession, Michelle Mittelstadt of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that studies worldwide immigration, has noted. Mittelstadt told PolitiFact in April 2017 that factors in Mexico had contributed to the drop-offs including lower birth rates, increased educational levels and an improved economy. In his commentary, Sperry wrote that according to Homeland Security data, ""the number of deportable illegal immigrants located by the U.S. Border Patrol plummeted by more than 89 percent over the five-year period during which"" the fencing between El Paso and neighboring Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was completed. Sperry said that when the El Paso fencing project ""started in 2006, illegal crossings totaled 122,261, but by 2010, when the 131-mile fence was completed from one end of El Paso out into the New Mexico desert, immigrant crossings shrank to just 12,251. They hit a low of 9,678 in 2012, before slowly ticking back up to a total of 25,193 last year. But they’re still well below pre-fence levels, and the Border Patrol credits the fortified barrier dividing El Paso from Mexico for the reduction in illegal flows,"" Sperry wrote. We found that he accurately recapped government-posted tallies of ""illegal alien apprehensions,"" which are generally used as a metric to measure illegal immigration. An exception: When we checked, the Border Patrol was reporting a slightly greater number of apprehensions in 2006, 122,656 making the 9,678 apprehensions in the sector in 2012 92 percent less than apprehensions in 2006. Unaddressed by Sperry: All along the nation’s southern border, according to the Border Patrol, apprehensions decreased each year from 2007 through 2011. That is, the agency’s pre-2017 low of 327,577 apprehensions in 2011 was down 69 percent from 1,071,972 apprehensions in 2006 and down 72 percent from 1,171,396 apprehensions in 2005. Border Patrol video singles out change in tactics Next, we reached out to the Border Patrol to ask about the fencing alone driving down apprehensions. We fielded no comment from Carlos A. Diaz, the agency’s Southwest Border branch chief, though he pointed us by email to a 2017 Customs and Border Protection video describing enforcement actions from 1992 through 2016 to stem illegal crossings. The El Paso portion of the video doesn’t mention fencing. Rather, it singles out the 285,000 apprehensions made in the El Paso sector in 1993--which a narrator says was the year that the Border Patrol implemented Operation Hold the Line at El Paso calling for the ""forward deployment of agents and technology to high-traffic areas. ""Focusing on prevention through deterrence,"" the narrator continues, ""the strategy proved successful and apprehensions decreased over 70 percent"" in the sector in one year ""and in 2015, 14,495 apprehensions were made in the El Paso sector."" That snippet led us to revisit federal tallies of apprehensions, which show both a post-1986 high of 285,981 apprehensions in the sector in 1993 and a 72 percent plummet to 79,688 apprehensions in 1994 though apprehensions increased the next two years, reaching 145,929 in 1996. In subsequent years through September 2017, the sector reported decreased apprehensions in 13 years and increased apprehensions in eight years; its 25,193 apprehensions in 2017 amounted to the sector’s third-most in a decade, possibly a reminder that economic conditions on both sides of the border, or unsafe conditions in parts of Central America, also can sway decisions to cross the Rio Grande. Other Border Patrol views When we asked, a couple of Border Patrol officers credited the El Paso fencing with enhancing enforcement. Doug Mosier, a Customs and Border Protection spokesman, said he’s worked as an El Paso-based agency public affairs officer since 1986. By email, Mosier said Operation Hold The Line ""revolutionized the way that border security was conducted in terms of federal law enforcement prevention efforts."" Mosier said Silvestre Reyes, later elected to the U.S. House, ""had tried a similar strategy on a smaller scale when he was a Border Patrol chief in McAllen, Texas, and it worked well for that community."" According to a 2013 El Paso Times news story, the approach instigated by Reyes, described as still in place, ""called for the deployment of every available Border Patrol agent to different sites along 20 miles of the El Paso-Juarez border, roughly from Sunland Park, N.M., to the Zaragoza port of entry."" Mosier elaborated to us: ""So, as the chief of El Paso Sector in 1993, he essentially positioned as many U.S. Border Patrol agents as he could spare (approximately 250 agents) along a primary 20-mile stretch of border separating El Paso/Juarez, over a three-week period. The result was astounding, since illegal apprehensions immediately dropped by approximately 80-percent overnight. Crime and loitering also fell by the wayside in the downtown district, which was later substantiated in several surveys and polls taken by the El Paso Times, and the then--El Paso Herald Post. ""At first the border community was in shock, but that soon gave way to widespread support which manifested in improved living conditions for residents in El Paso, and in some areas of N.M."" The Times story said that after Hold the Line was implemented, Reyes went on to urge more strategic fencing. Mosier, asked to assess the effects of the fencing, said that when ""primary pedestrian fencing (18-feet) was implemented in 2008, it provided effective infrastructure in much-needed areas of the border. It also improved USBP effectiveness by better directing illegal immigration into areas where Border Patrol had more resources to monitor traffic via technology, aircraft, combined with increased agent personnel. We said at that time, and still say today, that those combined resources, our strong working relationship with law enforcement partners, and the support by residents in El Paso were essential to the success of El Paso border security efforts,"" Mosier said. Cordero, who also told us he’s worked for the agency in the sector for 18 years, agreed the fencing helped reduce apprehensions but, he said, other enforcement activities and cooperation between law agencies and with Mexican authorities also mattered. Victor Manjarrez Jr. of the University of Texas at El Paso told us he was the sector chief when the fencing went up. By email, Manjarrez deemed the fencing a factor in driving down apprehensions along with increased Border Patrol personnel, expanded technology and infrastructure including lights and roads. ""Although the pedestrian wall had a huge impact,"" Manjarrez said, ""so did the increase in Border Patrol agents"" driven by a 2004 congressional directive to beef up the agency. ""I would disagree that the wall was the sole reason for the decline in criminal activity, but"" it ""was a MAJOR factor in improving the quality of life."" El Paso crime Sperry wrote that FBI crime-rate information shows the fencing drove down crime in El Paso. In fact, Sperry wrote, El Paso before 2010 ""was mired in violent crime and drug smuggling, thanks in large part to illicit activities spilling over from the Mexican side. Once the fence went up, however, things changed almost overnight."" His commentary also said: ""According to FBI tables, property crimes in El Paso have plunged more than 37 percent to 12,357 from their pre-fence peak of 19,702 a year, while violent crimes have dropped more than 6 percent to 2,682 from a peak of 2,861 a year."" Moore countered in a post-publication tweet that El Paso’s violent crime rate was on the slide long before the fencing got built. Our search of the Nexis news database showed too that the El Paso County sheriff, Richard Wiles, told a U.S. Senate committee in 2009 that by that year, El Paso had been considered one of the country’s safest cities for a dozen years, ""long before the new fence was built,"" Wiles testified. Moore, answering our request for more information, emailed us his spreadsheet suggesting that each year from 2000 through 2016, El Paso’s violent crime rate based on FBI data far trailed the average violent crime rate for like cities of 500,000 to 1 million residents. The FBI’s posted figures enabled us to confirm that El Paso’s violent crime rate trailed the national average for cities of 500,000 to 1 million residents from 1985 through 2016. The city’s rate also mostly decreased year to year, the figures indicate, though the city still saw 11 year-to-year increases with the biggest rate bump, 10 percent, occurring in 2008. Conversely, El Paso’s rate sank 10 percent or more 10 times in the 30 years including 1994, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006--all before the new fencing was mandated or fully installed--with the other big drops occurring in 1987 and 2013. Drug smuggling Sperry wrote that drug smuggling at the El Paso ""border entry point has also fallen dramatically. In fact, since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half."" ""The year before the wall was fully built in 2010,"" Sperry went on, ""the volume of illegal drugs confiscated by the feds along the El Paso border hit 87,725 pounds. The year after, the amount of drug seizures plummeted to 43,783 pounds. Last year, they dropped even further to a total of 34,329, according to Border Patrol reports obtained by The Post."" We found slightly different figures. Regardless, a chart provided by Cordero showed that the dollar amount of illegal drug seizures in the El Paso sector substantially declined from 2007 through 2014, when the agency’s $35.2 million in seizures was more than 400 percent less than the nearly $151 million in seizures in 2006. While seizures escalated in 2015 and 2016, reaching $54 million, they declined to $39 million in 2017, the agency’s chart says. Drug Seizures, El Paso Sector, U.S. Border Patrol, Fiscal 2006 though Fiscal 2017                SOURCE: Email, Ramiro Cordero, agent, U.S, Border Patrol, El Paso sector, Jan. 18, 2018 We later ran these mostly reduced interdictions of illegal drugs past Sanho Tree, director of the Drug Policy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies, which calls itself ""Washington’s first progressive multi-issue think tank."" Tree said by phone he wasn’t aware of research on the effect of the El Paso fencing on drug smuggling. Yet generally, Tree said, declines in captured drugs don’t necessarily signal fall-offs in smuggling, which relies on frequent shifts in methodology extending to drones, tunnels, even catapults. ""What you interdict shows you what you’re catching, it doesn’t show what you’re not catching,"" Tree said, adding that it’s hard to model the effects on smuggling of particular law enforcement tacks. Local police agencies didn’t engage with this fact-check. Sgt. Enrique Carrillo of the El Paso Police Department replied by email: ""We are not commenting on this."" Our requests to interview Sheriff Wiles went unfulfilled. Our ruling Sperry wrote that the fencing finished near El Paso in 2010 dramatically curtailed illegal crossings, local crime and drug smuggling. Such crossings evidently plunged after the fencing was built (though they later rebounded a bit) and it could be that drug smuggling fell off as well. Yet this claim fails to account for El Paso's violent crime rate trending down long before the fencing went up nor does it acknowledge other factors affecting security including a pre-1995 shift in enforcement strategy and stepped-up Border Patrol staffing. We give the fencing some, not all, credit and rate this statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Was Evan Jenkins once Joe Manchin's spokesman?
","Did a Republican candidate in the West Virginia primaries for U.S. Senate once serve as a spokesperson for his Democratic opponent?

""Do you remember when @EvanJenkinsWV was @Sen_JoeManchin’s spokesperson? It’s true! How will Jenkins effectively criticize Manchin when he was his spokesperson & held a fundraiser for him.

How will Jenkins effectively criticize Manchin when he was his spokesperson & held a fundraiser for him. Manchin will simply portray Jenkins as a dishonest flip-flopper, & it will be true. #wvsen Jenkins has switched parties several times. He switched from a Democrat to Republican in July 2013 to successfully challenge U.S. Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va. But Jenkins was never on Manchin’s payroll in the typical manner of a ""spokesperson."" In the parlance of political campaigns, it is the role of a spokesperson to offer public statements for the candidate that appear in news stories and press releases. That is not what Jenkins did, although he did support Manchin back then as a fellow Democrat. Morrisey’s tweet was in reference to a public candidate forum sponsored by the local chapter of the NAACP and the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition in October 2004. Jenkins, then a Democrat, represented then-Democratic gubernatorial candidate Manchin, at the event. ""Incumbent legislative candidates present included delegates Kevin Craig, Margarette Leach and James Morgan and senators Bob Plymale and Evan Jenkins, all Democrats,"" The Huntington, West Virginia Herald-Dispatch reported on Oct. 27, 2004. ""Jenkins was there to represent democratic gubernatorial candidate Joe Manchin."" Manchin did not attend the forum, where candidates for the state Legislature and county and city offices fielded questions on crime prevention, the environment and education, according to the news report. Morrisey spokeswoman Nachama Soloveichik clarified that Jenkins wasn't an official part of Manchin's team as a spokesperson, but rather, acted as his representative at this event. She did not provide evidence of any other times this occurred. Neither Jenkins nor the reporter, Jean Hardiman, recall how exactly Jenkins represented Manchin. ""Evan does not recall that local forum in detail but knows he did not give a speech or answer questions on Manchin’s behalf,"" Andy Sere, Jenkins’ spokesman, said. Sere offered Jenkins likely passed along his colleague’s regrets for his absence. ""At a lot of events, one politician will stand up to speak for someone who couldn’t be there and read something on the person’s behalf, or offer to relay concerns or take questions on the person’s behalf,"" Hardiman said. ""This may or may not have been the case. And he may or may not have been officially asked to be there, but I didn’t ask that question apparently."" Morrisey’s spokeswoman said it doesn’t matter that Jenkins wasn’t paid or hired to represent Manchin. ""He did it as a friend and political compatriot. That’s the whole point,"" Soloveichik said. ""How can he credibly take on Manchin when he was serving on Manchin’s team not that long ago — representing him at events and hosting fundraisers for him."" A spokesman for Manchin’s Senate campaign, Grant Herring, recalled Jenkins as a ""big supporter"" of Manchin in past campaigns.

Donald Trump’s ‘fake news’ epithet emboldens despots around the world
","Hours before President Donald Trump revealed the recipients of his ""fake news awards,"" one Republican lawmaker took to the Senate floor to deliver a stern warning about the perils of undermining journalism. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., cautioned that Trump’s anti-press rhetoric, such as calling the New York Times, CNN and ABC News an ""enemy of the American people,"" serves to embolden repressive governments around the world. ""Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press,""  Flake said, ""but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible."" Flake then ticked off several examples where foreign leaders deployed the phrase ""fake news"" to foster distrust of the media. Based on our review of the evidence, it’s reasonable to conclude that Trump’s disparagement of the media has been replicated abroad. An aide to Flake said the senator had referred to a Politico article that identified more than 15 instances where foreign leaders invoked the phrase ""fake news."" Here’s a sample: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in February invoked ""fake news"" to dismiss an Amnesty International report that up to 13,000 prisoners had been executed in one of his military prisons, saying the allegations were a reminder that ""we are living in a fake news era."" A security official in Buddhist-majority Myanmar in December used the term ""fake news"" to deny the very existence of the Rohingya people, a persecuted Muslim minority who are being ethnically cleansed, according to the United Nations. ""There is no such thing as Rohingya,"" the Myanmar official said. ""It is fake news."" Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in July said it was ""fake news"" that a constitutional crisis was playing out in Venezuela against a backdrop of widespread protests, human rights abuses and long-standing economic privation. ""The media spreads lots of false versions, lots of lies. This is what we call 'fake news' today, isn't it?"" he told Russian broadcaster RT, which the U.S. government considers a Kremlin propaganda outlet. An op-ed with the headline ""Trump is right, fake news is the enemy, something China has known for years"" ran in May in the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party in China, which is perennially a leading jailer of journalists. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in October said he had been ""demonized"" through ""fake news"" coverage of his brutal drug war, which has seen an unprecedented scale of extrajudicial killings, according to Human Rights Watch. At a joint press appearance in Manila in November, with Trump laughing at his side, Duterte called journalists ""spies."" There’s reason to think Trump inspired these responses. He has helped to popularize the phrase ""fake news,"" while shifting its meaning. According to CNN, Trump has used the word ""fake"" more than 400 times since his inauguration, including ""fake news"" and its variants. Overall, use of the phrase ""fake news"" across all forms of media increased 365 percent from November 2016 to November 2017, according to the Collins Dictionary, which named ""fake news"" its 2017 word of the year. At PolitiFact, we have used the term ""fake news"" to refer to fabricated content masquerading as a portrayal of actual events, naming it our 2016 Lie of the Year after made-up stories dominated social media during the presidential election. Trump, however, uses ""fake news"" to dismiss coverage that is unsympathetic to him and his administration, or as a criticism against entire news organizations. He’s also taken credit for rebranding the term ""fake news"" to apply to fact-based journalism, calling it ""one of the greatest of all terms I've come up with."" Experts said it’s easy to see why Trump’s use of the term ""fake news"" appeals to authoritarian leaders. Authoritarian governments are typified by highly centralized power and the predominance of the state over individual rights. ""Every authoritarian needs to spread his own version of reality, and will invest time and resources to discredit anyone else's,"" said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University. ""Many of them are corrupt, and if an investigation threatens to compromise their authority, or charges of wrongdoing come down, they need the public to believe only what they say."" Ben-Ghiat said Trump’s consistent efforts to attack the press as purveyors of bias and lies against him, and incite hostility toward individual news outlets and journalists, can be seen as part of a larger campaign against sectors of society that value evidence and investigation. ""When Trump says ‘I am the only one who matters’ it is not just self-glorification, but a message about whose version of the facts should count in America,"" she said. ""How can foreign rulers not feel empowered by this?"" A First Amendment advocate we spoke to drew parallels between Trump’s use of the term ""fake news"" and George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984, in which an authoritarian state inverts language to mean the opposite of its literal definition. ""It is a characteristic of authoritarian leaders, whether Communist or Nazi, to appropriate ordinary words and declare them to mean the opposite,"" Bruce Johnson, a Seattle-based media lawyer, told PolitiFact. ""Repressive regimes hold power by depriving their population of independent thinking and making the masses believe lies."" It’s worth noting we found no mentions of ""fake news"" from foreign leaders before 2016. The rise of the ""fake news"" epithet coincided with one of the most dangerous years for journalists. Last year, the Committee to Protect Journalists found 262 journalists were jailed for their work, a historic high for the second year in a row. In 21 cases, journalists were jailed under ""false news"" statutes, more than double the number in 2016, and in more countries, said Courtney Radsch, advocacy director at Committee to Protect Journalists.   ""It’s created an environment where it’s more permissive for governments to jail journalists on false news charges,"" she said. ""They certainly don't think they're going to face many repercussions or condemnation from the United States when you have the president making those comments on a regular basis."" Human rights activists say the growing disregard for facts has been making their job harder, too. ""Political leaders around the world have begun to deploy the label ‘fake news’ as a smear on fact-finding by journalists, human rights organizations, perhaps even prosecutors,"" wrote Iain Levine of Human Rights Watch. ""In doing so, they seek to break the link between evidence and culpability, making it more difficult to ensure those accountable pay for their misdeeds."" Flake said that Trump's use of the term ""fake news"" to undermine journalism seems to have ""inspired dictators and authoritarians."" Trump popularized the phrase ""fake news"" over the past two years as a way to dismiss news coverage that is unsympathetic to him and his administration, even when the reporting is accurate.  There are more than a dozen recent instances where foreign leaders, including dictators and authoritarians, have similarly invoked ""fake news"" to dismiss allegations against them, including widespread extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses. We found no mentions of ""fake news"" from foreign leaders before 2016. Expanded use of the epithet has also emboldened authoritarian governments to jail more journalists under ""false news"" statutes, experts said.   Flake has solid examples from around the world to back up his statement, and there’s strong correlation here given the timeline. We rate this claim True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096772600>],/factchecks/2018/jan/22/jeff-flake/donald-trumps-fake-news-epithet-emboldens-despots-/
"['Jobs', 'Population', 'Illinois', 'Rahm Emanuel']","
Chicago’s private-sector employment: Really the highest in city history?
","In a recent WGN radio interview, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel boasted that the count of private sector jobs in the city had hit an all-time high even as employment statewide sagged. ""Chicago now has the highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city,"" Emanuel told host Steve Cochran. ""And we’re doing it even with a state that’s actually dragging us back."" To put a fine point on it, Emanuel repeated the claim a minute later. ""I just told you, Chicago now has the highest private sector employment — ever,"" the mayor said, stressing the word ""ever."" All of which raises a demographic and workplace quandary. Census data make clear that the Chicago of today is a much smaller place than the Chicago of yesteryear. State officials counted nearly 1.18 million private sector jobs in Chicago, a number Emanuel’s office says is a record. How then to reconcile that claim with a city population swoon dating back to the 1950s? We decided to check. Chicago was long known as the ""second city,"" and while there is debate about the derivation of that nickname it is clear that for much of the last century the city trailed only New York in size. Census data show the city’s population peaked at 3.6 million in the official 1950 count. It was a very different era. South Side steel mills were thriving and the stockyards of ""hog butcher to the world"" fame were humming. The postwar suburban boom was only in its infancy, and the expressway system that eventually would make reverse commutes feasible had yet to be laid out. Just shy of 1.5 million Chicago residents held private sector jobs, according to the 1950 census, more than one-third of which were in manufacturing industries. Back then, Chicago’s workforce was still very much a collection of lunch-pail toting, blue-collar strap hangars, the decline of which is much lamented by politicians of today. The city’s population dwindled over the intervening decades, as did the number of jobs held by its residents. Today, the census pegs the city’s population at 2.7 million, down 900,000 from its 1950 high. But as late as 1970, census data show the population stood at nearly 3.4 million, with 1.2 million employed in the private sector. Yet Emanuel says private sector employment in the city is the highest ever. For an explanation, we reached out to the mayor’s office, where Emanuel spokesman Grant Klinzman pointed us to a December report from the Illinois Department of Employment Security. Klinzman said the nearly 1.18 million private sector jobs for Chicago were the highest in the history of the state report, which is issued annually. That explanation is problematic. In his radio remarks, Emanuel was emphatic that the 2017 jobs numbers were ""the highest in the history of the city,"" not just in the history of the report. What’s more, the Chicago numbers aren’t the highest in the history of the report, not by a longshot. Indeed, IDES spokesman Bob Gough said the state report series goes back to the 1950s, though only the last few decades worth of reports are posted online. Gough provided a copy of an old report that detailed city jobs numbers dating back to 1957. That year, it showed, Chicago logged 1.38 million private sector jobs—200,000 more than the current figure Emanuel says is a record. In 1990, the IDES private sector job tally for Chicago stood at 1.2 million, still in excess of the 2017 total. Loading... Gough said the methodology of data collection had changed over the years, but the bottom line employment numbers were unaffected. While Emanuel’s claim is contradicted by both state employment and federal census data, it’s important to note that the two agencies measure different things so their results don’t perfectly align. The census counts jobs held by Chicago residents, while the IDES counts jobs physically located in the city even if they are held by suburbanites and other non-residents. When we ran the old census data by Klinzman, he dismissed the line of questioning as irrelevant. ""At this point, we are parsing footnotes on a census report that predates the Eisenhower Administration,"" he wrote in an email. Experts we spoke with didn’t see it that way. ""Just the raw population of the city of Chicago in 1950 was 3.6 million people,"" said Peter Creticos, director of the Chicago-based Institute for Work and the Economy. ""We're at 2.7 (million). Just sort of on the face of it, you start to wonder."" Emanuel said,""Chicago now has the highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city."" That claim is refuted by a broad array of both state and federal jobs data which show Chicago was once a much bigger city with many more residents employed and many more jobs within the city limits than it has today. There is no doubt that the city jobs picture is brighter now than it has been in quite some time. But Emanuel took inarguably good news and sought to make it stupendous with his unsupportable contention that Chicago’s count of private sector jobs is now greater than at any time in the city’s history. We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967A5280>],/factchecks/2018/jan/22/rahm-emanuel/chicagos-private-sector-employment-really-highest-/

Would Trump bill have kept his grandfather and Melania from immigrating to U.S.? (And you, too?)
","In his bid to win the southern Wisconsin U.S. House seat held by GOP Speaker Paul Ryan, Democrat Randy Bryce is also running against President Donald Trump. The iron worker and union leader, who has raised more than $1 million, criticized Trump at a Jan. 10, 2018 campaign event in Racine, saying: His own legislation, what he wants to do as far as (unintelligible) immigrants, his own family would not have been allowed into the country, based on what he's doing. In other words, if legislation backed by Trump had been in place years ago, would his own family have been barred from entering the United States? As we’ll see, Bryce points to two family members -- Trump’s paternal grandfather and his current wife -- and pending legislation that would create a point system for qualifying to immigrate to the United States. What we found is that odds would have been against -- perhaps heavily against -- both Friedrich Trump and Melania Trump, but that Bryce’s declaration goes too far. There are a number of unknowns, particularly with Melania, which means there isn’t evidence to prove she would not have been allowed to immigrate. Pending immigration legislation The Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act was introduced in August 2017 and endorsed by Trump and is pending in the U.S. Senate. It is aimed at reducing legal immigration levels by half over a decade. The bill, as reported by PolitiFact National, would shift legal immigration into the United States from a system favoring family reunification to one based on skills and merit. People applying to immigrate would have to achieve at least 30 points under a system that would award points based primarily on age (younger is better), education (especially science and technology advanced degrees), ability to speak English, an offer of a high-paying job having been made and bringing along more than $1 million to invest. The New York Times offered a test you can take online and it quoted an economist who estimated that only 2 percent of Americans would get the 30 points needed just to be considered for immigration.

Under RAISE, he could not have applied for immigration until he turned 18. A Washington Post analysis cited to us by Bryce’s campaign noted Friedrich Trump’s lack of English-speaking and lack of high-level job skills, and concluded that had the RAISE Act been in place, Trump ""would likely not have gained entry to the United States."" Washington University law professor emeritus Stephen Legomsky, an immigration law specialist, went further. He told us that ""even under the most favorable assumptions, it’s extremely unlikely"" that Friedrich Trump would have amassed the minimum of 30 points just to be considered for immigration. Syracuse University political science professor Elizabeth Cohen, whose specialties include immigration, called Friedrich’s chances ""highly unlikely."" Gwenda Blair, a Columbia University journalism adjunct faculty member and author of The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President, helped us understand why Friedrich would have had such an uphill battle. She told us that before Friedrich immigrated, he had little, if any English-speaking skills; almost certainly had not finished high school; having trained as a barber’s apprentice, almost certainly would not have had a high-paying job awaiting him in New York; and, coming from a low-income family, almost certainly would not have had a large sum of money to invest. As for the first lady, the case is not overly favorable, but also not clear cut. Wife Melania Trump Bryce’s campaign pointed us to a San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News article. It declared that if RAISE were in place when Melania Trump arrived with a temporary visa ""she wouldn’t stand a chance of being able to stay."" According to the Mercury News: Melania, a native of Slovenia, first came to the United States, at age 26, on a tourist visa in August 1996. A few months later, she obtained an H-1B visa for skilled workers. There’s some question about whether she did some modeling work before getting her H-1B visa as well as how she obtained a green card in 2001. She married Trump in 2006 and became a U.S. citizen. ""At best, Melania could probably score about 21 points, so there would be no visa for her,"" the article said. She did have more going for her than Friedrich did. English: Melania currently speaks English with a heavy accent, but it’s one of five languages she’s reportedly fluent in. There’s no way to know, at the time she came to the United States, whether her English-speaking skills would have earned her zero points, 12, or some number in between. Education: Melania briefly studied architecture and design at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia. But, according to Vanity Fair, she dropped out after winning runner-up in a beauty contest. So, for a high school diploma or the equivalent, that’s one point. Job awaiting: At age 18, in Milan, Italy, Melania signed on with a modeling agency that said it sponsored the visa that brought her to New York in 1996. In New York in 1996, Melania would have needed a starting salary of at least $53,100 to earn any points, according to Cohen. Means: Another unknown is whether Melania could have brought along a large sum of money, even if that seems unlikely. Melania’s father managed a chain of car and motorcycle dealerships, and her mother was either a fashion designer or a garment factory worker, according to the New York Post. She would have earned points if she could have come over with the current equivalent of more than $1.35 million. Legomsky, the Washington University law professor, pointed out that even if Melania amassed 30 points, which he said was unlikely, it would be difficult for her to be chosen for immigration given that more applicants would have much higher scores. But he said he could not say for certain. Syracuse’s Cohen said Melania ""probably would have come close"" to hitting 30 points, and potentially could have exceeded 30, depending on her English proficiency and the salary of her first job. The White House responded to our request seeking information about Bryce’s claim, but did not provide any information. Our rating Bryce says that under Donald Trump’s ""own legislation,"" Trump's ""own family would not have been allowed into the country."" It seems unlikely, perhaps highly unlikely, that either Trump’s grandfather or his wife would have earned enough points under the legislation to be eligible for immigration. But, particularly with Melania Trump, it can’t be known for certain. For a statement that is partially accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976EF280>],/factchecks/2018/jan/19/randy-bryce/would-trump-bill-have-kept-his-grandfather-and-mel/

Fact-checking Cory Booker's statistic on attacks by white nationalist hate groups
","U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said in an interview on CNN that President Donald Trump’s reported comments describing Haiti as a ""s---hole"" present a ""moral moment"" for our country and caused pain for Haitians and other minorities. Booker then pivoted to talk about minorities being victims of crimes by white nationalist groups: ""In American history since 9/11, we've had 85 major attacks in our country, 73 percent of them have been by white nationalist hate groups against minorities, against Muslims, against others,"" Booker said Jan. 16. We fact-checked Booker’s numbers and found that he cited a valid government report.  However, he took a statistic in the report and flubbed how it was labeled. Booker’s spokesman said he was citing numbers from an April 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, ""Countering Violent Terrorism."" The report draws on data from the U.S. Extremist Crime Database that is maintained by the University of Maryland National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. The GAO report examined terrorist violence from Sept. 12, 2001 -- the day after the 9/11 terror attacks -- through Dec. 31, 2016. It found 85 deadly attacks in the United States by violent extremists. Among those incidents, far-right violent extremist groups were responsible for 62 incidents (73 percent) while radical Islamist violent extremists were responsible for 23 incidents (27 percent). Booker used the term ""white nationalists,"" but that’s not exactly the same thing as far-right extremist groups.  Far-right extremist groups are motivated by ideologies seeking an idealized future favoring a particular group. They include white supremacists and anti-government militias, among others. The GAO report (see page 29) shows that a subset of far-right incidents -- about 38 incidents -- were committed specifically by white supremacists. That means that about 45 percent of the 85 incidents were committed by white supremacists while Booker had said that 73 percent of the incidents were committed by white nationalist hate groups. We sent our findings to Booker’s spokesman Jeff Giertz to show that the GAO report showed a smaller percentage committed by white supremacists than the figure cited by Booker. Giertz pointed to additional perpetrators who were not identified as white supremacists in the table, but other sources such as news accounts or court records showed they held white supremacist or racist views. For example, the GAO labeled the murderers of minority victims in an Arizona incident as ""far right violent extremists"" but an Arizona Supreme Court ruling stated that they participated in a militia that focused on ""uplifting"" the white race and fostered negative views of minority groups. William Parkin, who helps direct the U.S. Extremist Crime Database, said that they break down incidents into categories based on the primary ideological motivation of the act. There could be secondary or mixed motives. ""That being said, there is a fluidity between varying far-right extremist ideologies,"" said Parkin, a Seattle University criminal justice assistant professor. ""At the individual level, it would not be uncommon for those who identify as being white supremacists to also be anti-government, and vice versa."" We will note that pinpointing what percent of attacks were committed by any particular label of perpetrator is not an exact science, and that the numbers can change depending upon definitions. Another source of data on such attacks is the New America Foundation, which found that about 70 percent of deadly attacks are by people motivated by far right views since Sept. 11. However, that includes individuals motivated by views other than white nationalism including more general anti-government views and anti-abortion views. ""Overall, though the definition of the ideologies is a bit too specific in Booker’s comment, it does convey the larger difference in number of deadly attacks from the far right as opposed to other motives though it is important to note that jihadists have killed more people despite carrying out fewer attacks,"" said David Sterman, New America analyst. Booker said, ""In American history since 9/11, we've had 85 major attacks in our country, 73 percent of them have been by white nationalist hate groups."" Booker cited a GAO report that analyzed violent incidents. While Booker said that 73 percent were by ""white nationalist hate groups,"" the report said that 73 percent were by a broader category of ""far right wing violent extremist groups."" The same report shows about 45 percent of incidents were committed by white supremacists. The number could rise if we counted additional perpetrators who sympathized with white supremacist ideals but were not labeled as white supremacists by the GAO. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BB5C00>],/factchecks/2018/jan/18/cory-booker/fact-checking-cory-bookers-statistic-attacks-white/

Missing data sinks U.S. and apartheid South Africa claim on black-white wealth gap
","Since August, the New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof has written a series of columns aimed at showing that white and black Americans live in very different worlds. For Kristof, understanding this reality is essential if the country hopes to fix the trends that lie behind the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of the police. Comedy Central’s The Daily Show picked up on an interview Kristof did with CNN and inserted a clip in its Dec. 4, 2014, program. Kristof was making a fundamental point about inequality in the United States. ""The race gap for wealth in the United States right now between the median white family and the median black family is 18-fold,"" Kristof said. ""That’s greater than the black-white wealth gap was in apartheid South Africa."" For those who might not remember, apartheid was the iron-fisted system of comprehensive segregation that held sway in South Africa until 1991. Nearly all the country’s land was reserved for whites. Non-whites were divided into Indians, coloreds and blacks. Laws decreed where nonwhites could live and blacks were isolated in regions dubbed Bantustans. Needless to say, all economic advantages flowed to whites while blacks faced enormous barriers. If disparities were greater today in America, it would be shocking indeed. We decided to probe into Kristof’s claim that the wealth gap is worse in the United States. A reminder: Wealth is distinct from income. It measures how much we own, not how much we make. While the two are closely tied, economists talk about wealth in terms of net worth. A house for example adds to our net worth if its value is higher than the amount of the mortgage. Assets minus debts gives you net worth. The latest government numbers back up the American slice of Kristof’s argument. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2011 the net worth for the median white household was 17.5 times greater than the median black household. That’s pretty much what Kristof said. His statement however runs into trouble on the South African side. Not because it is provably wrong, but because there is no data to back it up. In his corresponding newspaper column, Kristof backed his point with a link to a blog run by a former southern Africa bureau chief for the Washington Post. The blog said, ""Racial inequality in apartheid South Africa reached its zenith in 1970 when black households’ median net worth represented 6.8 percent of whites’, according to an analysis of government data by Sampie Terreblanche, professor emeritus of economics at Stellenbosch University."" Another way to say the same thing is that the median net worth of white households was nearly 15 times greater than that of blacks. That would put Kristof on solid ground, but for one thing. The economist Sampie Terreblanche told PunditFact that his analysis dealt with income, not wealth. ""The per capita income of African blacks in South Africa was in 1970 only 6.8 percent of the per capita income of the Whites,"" Terreblanche said. ""It is in Table 10.8 in my 2002 book The history of inequality in South Africa."" When we told Kristof about this discrepancy, he contacted Terreblanche himself and heard the same thing. Terreblanche says he has only written about per capita income, not household wealth. While we cannot compare the wealth gap between apartheid South Africa and the United States, we can look at the income gap between the two countries. Through that lens, apartheid South Africa was far worse for blacks. Blacks in South Africa in 1970 earned 6.8 percent of the per capita income of whites. Blacks in the United States in 2009 earned 65 percent of the per capita income of whites, In 2013, the median household income of blacks in the United States was 59 percent that of whites. Ingrid Woolard is professor of economics at the University of Cape Town and heads South Africa’s national household panel survey the National Income Dynamics Study. ""I am 99 percent certain that no household-level data exists on wealth in South Africa pre-1994,"" Woolard said. ""I think people get confused between income and wealth. Even income data for black households prior to 1993 is patchy. There is very little wealth data for South Africa even post-apartheid."" We found World Bank data on inequality in South Africa, but it examined the distribution of income, not wealth. While income and wealth often go hand-in-hand, they don’t always move the same way. The Pew Research Center noted that in America, since 1967, black-white income gap narrowed a bit, but the wealth gap grew wider. (We found different estimates of the black-white income ratio over time, with the complicating factor that in 1967 the Census Bureau did not distinguish between whites and non-Hispanic whites. Based on 1967 race categories, the number shifted from 58 percent in 1967 to 63 percent in 2013.) Our ruling Kristof said that for median families, the wealth gap in America now between blacks and whites is ""greater than the black-white wealth gap was in apartheid South Africa."" That statement is based on a blog post that in turn relies on a South African economist. Something must have become garbled because that economist told PunditFact he has written about disparities in income, not wealth. The two measures are very different. Another South African economist said she knows of no household wealth data for her country before 1994, which would be several years after apartheid ended. We do not doubt that the wealth gap between blacks and whites was large under apartheid but Kristof relied on a source that mischaracterized the data and spoke with a precision that could not exist. As such, no comparison to the wealth gap in America is possible. Without any supporting evidence, this claim rates False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C105C0>],/factchecks/2014/dec/17/nicholas-kristof/missing-data-sinks-apartheid-wealth-gap-claim/

Do 73 percent of benefits from mortgage deduction go to those earning $250,000 a year?
","Not long before he was to officially retire from the U.S. Senate, Oklahoma Republican Tom Coburn appeared on CNN to discuss the Senate’s report on alleged CIA torture of detainees. But the Dec. 11, 2014, interview, eventually turned to an issue Coburn is better known for -- cutting government spending. Coburn aimed his comments at tax breaks given to people who, he suggested, don’t really need them. ""We're going to spend $5 trillion over the next five years in terms of tax benefits to selected groups of people that may not necessarily be (helpful in) growing and creating new jobs,"" Coburn said. He continued, ""Home mortgages -- everybody said that's a middle-class benefit. It's not -- 73 percent of it goes to people making a quarter-million dollars or more a year. So, that's not middle class. That's upper class."" We wondered if Coburn’s numbers were accurate, so we took a closer look. Pretty quickly, we were able to find where the 73 percent figure came from. It stems from a report by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress. The May 2013 report attempts to classify which classes of Americans benefit from ""tax expenditures."" What’s a ""tax expenditure""? It’s Washington jargon for a preference written into the federal tax system -- basically, a tax break -- that reduces the amount of revenue the government brings in. Typically, such tax breaks provide financial assistance to identifiable groups of people -- homeowners, in the case of the mortgage-interest deduction. The provision in question allows homeowners to deduct the amount of the mortgage interest they paid during the year when figuring out how much they need to pay in federal taxes. Coburn’s concern was that the deduction disproportionately benefits richer homeowners, rather than middle-class homeowners. It would seem to make sense that richer homeowners would benefit from this deduction more than less-well-heeled homeowners would, if only because the richer you are, the more expensive your house will likely be, and, therefore, the more you will tend to pay in interest. But Coburn’s statistic inflates the degree by which the richest Americans benefit from the tax break. CBO found that 73 percent of the benefits from the mortgage-interest deduction went to the top quintile of Americans, as measured by their pre-tax income. (""Quintile"" refers to the top one-fifth of the income spectrum.) The CBO report doesn’t specify the income cutoff to make it into the top quintile. But other data shows that it’s well below the $250,000 Coburn cited. Census Bureau figures for 2012 found that only 2.4 percent of American households earned at least $250,000. This suggests that the top quintile starts somewhere between $100,000 and $125,000. That estimate is backed up by calculations from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, which found that the top quintile starts at a little over $100,000. Even more persuasively, the Tax Policy Center looked at the exact question Coburn raised. The center didn’t specifically break out incomes above $250,000, but it found that those with incomes above $200,000 took 45.2 percent of the benefits from the deduction. That means that those earning $250,000 would be taking somewhere between 35 percent and 40 percent of the benefits. Thirty-five to 40 percent is certainly a disproportionate share -- those earning $200,000 or more accounted for just 6.3 percent of all taxpayers -- but it’s still only about half of Coburn’s 73 percent share. Coburn ""is way off,"" said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center. Coburn’s office clarified the discrepancy by saying that he had been referring to CBO’s average household income for the top quintile in 2011. That was $234,700, or within shouting distance of a quarter million dollars. However, the $234,000 figure is the average income of all households in the top quintile, meaning that many of the households in that grouping earned less than that. We believe the lower figure -- the top-quintile entry threshold of a little over $100,000 -- more accurately reflects the point Coburn was making. Our ruling Coburn said 73 percent of the benefits of the mortgage-interest deduction ""goes to people making a quarter-million dollars or more a year."" In reality, 73 percent of the mortgage-interest deduction benefits go to those making a little over $100,000 a year, not $250,000 a year. That’s still a large amount of the benefit going to a relatively high-income group, but it’s not as high as Coburn indicated. In reality, 73 percent of the benefits are sent to the top-earning 20 percent of taxpayers, rather than to top 5 percent, as Coburn suggested.

WMC’s Kurt Bauer says businesses favor ‘right-to-work’ states when looking for expansion sites
","Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s first term was marked by a flood of pro-business legislation. With Walker poised to start a second term in January 2015, the state’s leading business lobby -- Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce -- wants Walker and Republicans to press further in the name of creating a better business climate. Tops on the legislative agenda for the group, at least based on a Dec. 8, 2014 opinion piece by its president and CEO Kurt Bauer, is so-called right-to-work legislation. ""Should joining a private-sector union be voluntary as it is in 24 states or should it be mandatory?"" Bauer wrote. He added: ""Beyond the personal freedom component to this debate is the economic development argument. It is well-known that site selectors who decide where businesses expand or relocate shun closed shop states like Wisconsin in favor of Right to Work states like Iowa, Indiana and Michigan."" Iowa’s right to work law dates to 1947. Indiana and Michigan approved the change in 2012. One four-letter word caught our attention in Bauer’s piece: ""shun."" Is Wisconsin getting shut out of business expansion because it allows private employers to sign contracts with unions that require all covered employees to join the union? A closer look We started by asking Bauer about the term ""site selectors."" Bauer told us it refers to CEOs and consulting firms who help companies search for new locations. He pointed to a 2012 survey of U.S. corporate executives regarding factors they consider when choosing sites for expansion or relocation. In that survey by Area Development magazine, 72 percent said it was important or very important that a state has passed ""right-to-work"" legislation. Bauer noted that in a November 2012 article in the magazine, one consultant estimated that three-fourths of his firm’s clients want only locations that are in right-to-work states. That kind of anecdotal evidence was mentioned repeatedly by site-search consultants quoted in the magazine, as well as in another publication, Site Selection. Estimates vary on the strength of the preference. States will be eliminated at the first stage in ""about half"" of projects, one consultant told Site Selection. After Michigan passed right to work, another consultant told the publication that ""it will get Michigan a few more looks on site searches, mostly industrial ones. It’s hard to know what percentage."" Some consultants say manufacturing companies are more likely to steer clear of unions when compared to firms in other sectors. Wisconsin is a manufacturing-rich state. Area Development magazine framed the right to work debate this way: Businesses tend to support right-to-work because it makes unionization less likely and in turn often means lower labor costs. Unions oppose them because right to work weakens union membership and wages. ""In a right-to-work state, any worker choosing not to join the union or pay for the services still gets the benefits,"" the magazine noted. ""Unions often refer to those workers as ‘free riders,’ and because wages tend to be lower in right-to-work states, unions famously refer to the concept as ‘right-to-work for less.’ While ""shun"" suggests Wisconsin simply loses out when businesses are deciding where to build, even a quick peek at the state jobs agency’s website yields examples to the contrary. Global food ingredients company Kerry expanded here as did Seneca Foods; Plexus Corp. built a global headquarters in Neenah; Amazon is opening a new facility in Kenosha. The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation ""does not track whether unionization or Right to Work Laws are a factor in a company’s decision to relocate or expand in Wisconsin,"" jobs agency spokesman Mark Maley said. The same 2010 article Bauer cited noted that ""choosing a state with a low-union profile or locating in a (right to work) state only ranked 10th and 12th respectively among a list of 26 different site selection factors,"" according to Area Development’s 26th Annual Corporate Survey. In the most recent Area Development survey, published in 2013, these factors were ahead of union issues: taxes, availability of buildings, energy costs, building costs, telecommunications infrastructure, skilled workforce, highway connections, government investment in workforce development. Bauer acknowledged many factors can come into play when businesses make such decisions. Responses from his group’s own survey of members show that some executives are concerned about the lack of a right to work law. But the number (15 percent) was well short of a majority. In past years, the WMC did not ask specifically about attitudes toward unionization. But that changed in 2014, the group said. Some 260 executives participated in the survey. ""When asked what one thing state government can do to improve Wisconsin’s business climate, 35 percent said reduce taxes, 15 percent said become a Right to Work state and 14 percent said reform employment laws, like harmonizing the state and federal versions of family medical leave,"" a WMC news release noted. Our rating Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce said: ""Site selectors who decide where businesses expand or relocate shun closed shop states like Wisconsin in favor of Right to Work states like Iowa, Indiana and Michigan."" There’s anecdotal evidence that some firms screen out states without right to work laws when seeking to expand, and surveys of site selectors say this issue is important. But its far down the list of top concerns for many site selectors, suggesting that ""shun"" is too strong a term.

Does Yoho's bill restrict background checks on immigrants?
","House Republicans are so displeased with President Barack Obama’s executive action granting amnesty to undocumented immigrants, they voted to strip White House authority over the matter altogether. U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, a veterinarian from Gainesville, introduced HR 5759 on Nov. 20, the same day Obama issued guidelines sparing from deportation more than 4 million immigrants who have been in the country illegally for five years or more but have American-born or legal-resident children. Obama’s action lets those immigrants stay for three years and allows them to apply for work permits if they pay fees and pass a background check. Yoho’s bill, which passed the House along party lines on Dec. 4, sought to stop Obama by taking away the president’s right to act unilaterally on immigration, making such actions illegal. It has widely been viewed as a symbolic gesture, and the Democrat-controlled Senate didn’t vote on it before the end of the session, so the bill died. But wait: Yoho’s office told PolitiFact the congressman would reintroduce the bill next session -- when Republicans control both houses of Congress. The White House said even if the bill had managed to pass the Senate, Obama would have vetoed it, since the measure ""would make the broken immigration system worse, not better,"" according to a statement of administration policy released the day the House approved the bill. ""By attempting to restrict the Administration’s ability to conduct national security and criminal background checks on undocumented immigrants, H.R. 5759 would make the Nation’s communities less safe."" Since Yoho said the bill would be coming back, we wondered if the legislation would restrict the White House’s ability to conduct security and background checks. Checking the background H.R. 5759 keeps the executive branch from doing anything to exempt or defer any individual or groups from being subject to current immigration laws. ""Any action by the executive branch with the purpose of circumventing the objectives of this statute shall be null and void and without legal effect,"" the bill says. That’s a tall order: Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., recently said presidents going back to Dwight Eisenhower have issued executive actions on immigration, a claim we found Mostly True. Prior executive actions on immigration have provided asylum to specific groups, deferred removals from the United States and expanded the definitions of immigration laws to include more immigrants than originally covered. (H.R. 5759 would allow action that would save groups facing mortal danger, like refugees, or to keep criminal aliens or witnesses in the country at the request of law enforcement.) The White House told PolitiFact Florida that Obama’s action requires about 4 million eligible undocumented immigrants to register and undergo checks by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The checks would determine if someone is a threat to national security or public safety, has a criminal history or has perpetrated fraud, among other flags. Homeland Security didn’t answer our questions about how the order would affect their current workload, but Boynton Beach immigration attorney Richard Hujber said it will lead to a crush of cases in an already backlogged system. The agency has to perform background checks for everything the government processes, he said, whether it’s for a work permit, a travel permit, a citizenship application or anything else. Citizenship and Immigration Services posted about 1,000 job openings the day after Obama’s announcement. About 95 percent of Citizenship and Immigration Services budget comes from fees the immigrants pay. Yoho’s office countered that Homeland Security would still have the power to perform background checks as usual. ""The congressman’s bill simply clarifies that the president does not have authority to exempt/defer deportation for categories of illegal aliens; because that would in effect be changing or rewriting law, which is a constitutional power of Congress, not the executive,"" Yoho spokesman Brian Kaveney told us in an email. So it’s not that background checks wouldn’t be performed anymore; they couldn’t be performed as part of the executive action’s guidelines because the president’s deferment would no longer be allowed. Mark Schlakman, a law professor and senior program director for Florida State University’s Center for the Advancement of Human Rights, was dubious about whether public safety would be any more endangered by not performing these checks. It’s hard to make that case when these immigrants weren’t previously going to submit to background checks anyway, he said.

Our ruling President Obama’s office said Yoho's HR 5759 attempts ""to restrict the Administration's ability to conduct national security and criminal background checks on undocumented immigrants."" The bill would make illegal any move from the White House that reclassified large categories of immigrants counter to current immigration law. Obama’s action establishes reprieve from removal after undocumented immigrants passed a background check, which would likely strain an already backlogged system. It ostensibly follows current laws as guidelines. But because Obama's action defers the status of the immigrants, the process it proposes to set up would violate the terms of Yoho’s bill. The Department of Homeland Security would continue to be able to perform checks as usual, so there’s little evidence public safety would be any more threatened than before.

Is the U.S. prison population as big as Russia, China and North Korea combined?
","The United States gets a bad rap for the huge number of residents in lockup across the nation. And in many cases, its reputation for incarcerating more people than any other country is deserved. But one recent attempt by Hollywood activists who wanted to put the country’s prison population in perspective went too far. Following on protests stemming from the shooting of Michael Brown, director-writer Matthew Cooke and producer-actor Adrian Grenier co-wrote a Huffington Post column that called on Americans to support three groups focused on criminal justice reform. Many of the claims in the column were supported by links from outside sources, but one that wasn’t caught the eye of a reader, who asked us if it is true. ""Behind the front lines we've systematically corralled masses of Americans into the largest prison system on the planet. We have more of our people in prison than Russia, China, and North Korea combined,"" the column said. ""And most are non-violent, so what is this colossal net we've cast over so many people? What's it really doing? And who are the 2.3 million Americans we've dragged into cages?"" We can only evaluate statements on the Truth-O-Meter from one person at a time, so we’ll focus on Cooke since we spoke to him for our story. About that interview: After we presented some of our initial findings to Cooke via email, he quickly wrote back that he used the wrong countries in his statistic. He meant to include Iran, he said, which has about 220,000 prisoners, and not Russia. He said he would seek a correction for that line, but the overarching point that there are more people locked up in the United States than other countries holds up. Here’s what we found. Nailing down how many Americans are behind bars is complex. We saw recent estimates from 2.24 million people, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, to more than 2.4 million, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a Massachusetts think tank that advocates for reducing the American prison population. It’s hard to calculate a tally of inmates because the scope of incarceration facilities is so wide. There are state prisons, local jails, federal prisons, military prisons, juvenile correctional centers, immigration detention facilities and others for American Indian territories and overseas territories. State prisons house the biggest chunk of inmates by far at an estimated 1.36 million people, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, which detailed population snapshots for nine population facilities in a pie chart earlier in 2014. Combined with the massive turnover of old inmates leaving and new ones coming in, it makes pinning down an exact number very difficult. For the sake of fleshing out Cooke’s initial comparison with China, Russia and North Korea, we delved into a global report from the International Centre for Prison Studies, which is widely reported and recently partnered with the Institute for Criminal Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London. The group’s China estimate is 1.64 million sentenced prisoners, though it does not factor in citizens who are in pre-trial detention or ""administrative detention,"" which could be around a half-million people. For Russia, the prison population was estimated at 681,600 in January 2013, down from earlier years after leaders granted political amnesty to prisoners, and tuberculosis swept detention facilities. The center does not have a reliable estimate for North Korea, notorious for its secretive government and political prison camps, though it loosely references an estimate of 150,000 prisoners. A United Nations report showed satellite images of prisons holding around 120,000 people. Regardless, using the conservative estimates for just China and Russia produces a sum (2.321 million) that is either more or less than the estimated U.S. prison population depending on the source. Adding in rough estimates for part of North Korea’s population obviously pushes up the total. Peter Wagner, executive director of the Prison Policy Initiative, said we should set the raw numbers aside because they are not as useful as comparing each country’s incarceration rate, which factors in population size. The U.S. prison population rate is highest in the world, at 716 per 100,000 of the national population, according to the International Centre for Prison Studies. Russia’s is 475 prisoners per 100,000 of the national population, and China’s is 121 per 100,000 population, which is below the world’s median rate, Wagner pointed out. More than half of countries and territories have rates below 150 per 100,000 population, the report said. Wagner’s group also compares incarceration rates for U.S. states with other countries. At the top are Southern states like Louisiana (1,341 inmates per 100,000 population) and Mississippi (1,155). At the bottom are Northeastern states like Maine and Vermont (rates of 277 and 257, respectively), which still put more people behind bars than any of the United States’ close allies, such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Canada. Our ruling Cooke (and Grenier) tried to make a striking point about the size of the U.S. prison population when they wrote, ""We have more of our people in prison than Russia, China, and North Korea combined."" When we contacted Cooke, he acknowledged that the comparison is questionable, as respected (and conservative) estimates for China and Russia alone exceed the low-end count of American prisoners. Cooke said he would change the line in the column to be more accurate, and it now says, ""We have more of our people in prison than anyone else -- more than Iran, more than North Korea, more than Russia or even China."" (Kudos to him for acknowledging the error.) Still, experts say the preferred measure of comparison, a country’s incarceration rate, shows the United States far ahead of other countries, which supports the underlying point. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0A5E40>],/factchecks/2014/dec/16/matthew-cooke/us-prison-population-big-russia-china-and-north-ko/

PolitiFact: High school diplomas will be new under prison partnership
","Gov. Nathan Deal announced in November that the state Department of Corrections will be partnering with a charter school to help inmates at one state prison receive their high school diplomas. Deal said the program should allow inmates at Lee Arrendale State Prison in Habersham County to ""change the direction of their lives"" and have ""a greater chance of avoiding relapse"" once they are back in society. Seven out of 10 inmates in Georgia’s state prisons lack a high school diploma or GED, the governor said. ""It has been many years, if ever, since an inmate has completed his or her high school diploma while incarcerated in a state correctional facility for adults,"" L.C. ""Buster"" Evans, assistant commissioner of the Georgia Department of Corrections, said in a Nov. 12 press release. The statement by Evans, a former Forsyth County school superintendent, piqued our interest. Hadn’t policymakers in Georgia and nationally been talking on and off for years about the high rate of recidivism among released prisoners? And hadn’t most concluded that the solutions are complex but include addressing systemic barriers to success, such as insufficient job skills and education? We began by contacting Susan Megahee, a spokeswoman at the Georgia Department of Corrections, which runs one of the nation’s largest prison systems with nearly 55,000 inmates, more than 160,000 probationers and 12,000 employees. We asked about Evans’ statement. ""We have no historical data of any offender receiving a high school diploma,"" Megahee told PolitiFact. That doesn’t mean that some inmates who have entered the prison system as high school dropouts haven’t become more marketable -- from an educational standpoint -- while behind bars. Indeed, thousands have. But until now, the avenue they had was the GED, a four-subject high school equivalency test that measures skills required by high schools and expected by colleges and employers. The four subjects are science, social studies, mathematical reasoning and reasoning through language arts. GED programs are available to offenders in state prisons, private prisons, transitional centers and the Bainbridge Substance Abuse Treatment Center, Megahee told PolitiFact. Inmates at those facilities earned 1,557 GEDs in fiscal 2009, 1,510 in 2010, 1,620 in 2011, 1,260 in 2012, 1,290 in 2013 and 1,167 in 2014, according to the Technical College System of Georgia, the agency that administers the GED program. The Department of Corrections in the past has assessed offenders’ level of education by three standards -- Literacy Remedial Reading, below the fifth-grade level; Adult Basic Education between the fifth-grade and eighth-grade levels; and General Educational Development (GED), testing at or above the eighth-grade level with the potential to earn a high school equivalency diploma. ""Now, that our partnership with (Mountain Education Charter School) has been established, we will offer an additional opportunity for education, which is a true high school diploma,"" Megahee said. ""These options will help prepare returning citizens for successful re-entry."" This is possible under a state law that designates the Department of Corrections as a ""special school"" district, she said. Beginning in January, teachers from the Mountain Education Charter School -- a collaboration between the school districts in Elbert, Fannin, Forsyth, Gilmer, Lumpkin, Pickens, Rabun, Towns, Union and White counties -- are expected to use online and self-paced instructional programming to work with suitable inmates from Arrendale. These teachers already work with nontraditional students, and this program with the Department of Corrections will pair them with some of Arrendale’s 1,400 female inmates -- 200 of whom are under age 22. ""This will have a long-term impact on recidivism by graduating more inmates with a high school credential,"" said Mike Light, a spokesman for the Technical College System of Georgia and a former spokesman for the Department of Corrections. He said it reflects positively ""on the governor on down"" and marks a major shift in philosophy from the days when prisoners were released with $25 and a bus ticket and told ""hope you don’t come back."" The prison system will still have GED programs, and it announced in August that it is fast-tracking GED programs for inmates at Arrendale and two other medium-security prisons. Inmates at these facilities will be able to prepare for their GEDs in 10 to 12 weeks -- rather than the normal 16 to 18 months -- and then be eligible for further vocational and job training, state officials said. ""With over 27,000 offenders that have self-reported as not having a high school diploma, offering this additional programming will allow for more offenders to earn their GED,"" Department of Corrections Commissioner Brian Owens said in August. ""Offender education is a top priority in our departmental efforts toward criminal justice reform."" GEDs are recognized nationwide and accepted by more than 95 percent of U.S. employers, colleges and universities, the Technical College System of Georgia website states. Our conclusion: L.C.""Buster"" Evans, assistant commissioner of the Georgia Department of Corrections, said: ""It has been many years, if ever, since an inmate has completed his or her high school diploma while incarcerated in a state correctional facility for adults."" He is technically correct that Georgia prisons have not had a high school program such as the one that is being launched in January. And in a prison system where seven out of 10 inmates lack a diploma or GED, this could be the start of major improvements. But the GED is a high school equivalency, recognized by the vast majority of employers, colleges and universities. And that’s something the state has been helping some inmates attain for years. That’s important context. For this reason, we rate Evans’ statement Mostly True.

Peter King says Senate CIA report found detainees were not killed, did not suffer 'lasting injuries'
","Rep. Peter King brushed off a new Senate report on the CIA interrogation program as a partisan, one-sided account. Nothing to see here, people. Move along. During a Dec. 9 appearance on a local radio station, King, a New York Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterintelligence & Terrorism, said that the CIA tactics were ""rough, they were tough, but they were not torture."" He went on to downplay the report’s findings. ""This is not a case where people were killed,"" he said. ""We’re not talking about anyone being burned or stabbed or cut or anything like that,"" he added. ""We’re talking about people being made to stand in awkward in positions, have water put into their nose and into their mouth. But again, nobody suffered any lasting injuries from this."" The Senate Intelligence Committee began investigating the scope of the CIA Enhanced Interrogation Program in 2009. On Dec. 9, committee chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., released the executive summary of the committee’s review of the program, which began in the wake of the 9-11 terrorist attacks. It alleges the program was not effective in gathering intelligence, CIA officials lied to Congress and the president about its effectiveness, the program was poorly managed, and the tactics were more brutal than people were told. Those conclusions are contested by many CIA officials and some Senate Republicans, who wrote a 160-page minority opinion. However, many details uncovered by the report, on which King was commenting, don’t appear to be disputed and are based on 6.3 million pages of documents and CIA cables reviewed by Senate staff. Even an ancillary reading of the Senate report’s executive summary — a 600-page document that is only one-tenth of the still-classified full study — finds King’s comments to be dubious. King’s staff did not respond to requests for comment. ""Not a case where people were killed"" Let’s put to bed one false claim King made off the bat: that no one was killed. In fact, someone did die as a result of the interrogation program. In 2002, the CIA interrogated Gul Rahman at Cobalt, an overseas detention center with an undisclosed location described as a dungeon. Many of the controversial interrogations outlined in the report took place at Cobalt. Rahman, described in the report as a suspected Islamic extremist, underwent ""48 hours of sleep deprivation, auditory overload, total darkness, isolation, a cold shower, and rough treatment,"" according to communications with CIA headquarters. Later, Rahman was shackled to the wall and made to lie on a cold concrete floor. He was stripped of all of his clothes except a sweatshirt. In the morning, guards discovered Rahman was dead, likely from hypothermia. ""Not talking about anyone being burned or stabbed or cut or anything like that"" The report describes how detainees at Cobalt were subject to something called ""rough takedowns"" that included physical abuse. ""Approximately five CIA officers would scream at a detainee, drag him outside of his cell, cut his clothes off, and secure him with Mylar tape. The detainee would then be hooded and dragged up and down a long corridor while being slapped and punched."" These takedowns were ""thoroughly planned and rehearsed"" and did cause physical harm to detainees. Rahman, for example, had abrasions on his face, legs, and hands, medical examiners found. One of the most discussed elements of the CIA report is the use of ""rectal feeding"" or ""rectal rehydration."" In at least five cases, detainees were force fed through their anus. In one instance, a lunch of ""hummus, pasta with sauce, nuts, and raisins was ‘pureed’ and rectally infused"" into a  detainee named Majid Khan, the report said. While current and former CIA officials have defended the practice as medically necessary, Physicians for Human Rights said in a statement that rectal feedings are, ""a form of sexual assault masquerading as medical treatment."" The CIA’s chief of interrogations characterized rectal feeding as a demonstration of ""total control,"" the report said. Additionally, an unidentified individual in the report said the procedure was used to make people talk and helped to ""clear a person’s head."" One detainee, Mustafa al-Hawsawi, as a result of rectal feeding was ""later diagnosed with chronic hemorrhoids, an anal fissure, and symptomatic rectal prolapse,"" the report said. These instances of physical harm directly contradict King’s description. ""We’re talking about people being made to stand in awkward in positions"" King’s statement significantly downplays what detainees endured. For starters, they were not just made to stand in awkward positions. That tactic was used in addition to sleep deprivation methods that required detainees remain awake for up to 180 hours. Additionally, two detainees broke bones in their feet while trying to escape capture. Despite a CIA physician recommending they stay off their feet for several weeks, the two detainees were placed in ""standing sleep deprivation."" One of the detainees was kept awake on his feet for 52 hours, the other for an undisclosed amount of time. Similar tactics were used on a detainee with a sprained ankle and on a detainee with a prosthetic leg. Detainees were often naked and shackled with their hands above their head in complete darkness and loud music blasting. In April 2006, President George W. Bush ""expressed discomfort"" when shown images of a detainee ""chained to the ceiling, clothed in a diaper, and forced to go to the bathroom on himself,"" according to the reports’ account of CIA documents. ""Nobody suffered any lasting injuries from this"" You could probably successfully argue that death is a pretty lasting injury. As were the chronic hemorrhoids and anal fissure suffered by the detainee who faced rectal feeding. But there were additional injuries as well. Abu Zubaydah, a high-level target, was captured in a raid during which he sustained a gunshot wound. Despite the obvious need for medical attention, care was instead withheld to convey that it  was contingent on Zubaydah’s cooperation. The wound eventually deteriorated due to a ""combination of a lack of hygiene, sub-optimal nutrition, inadvertent trauma to the wound secondary to some of the stress techniques utilized at that stage, and the removal of formal obvious medical care,"" the report said. Zubaydah also lost an eye in custody and was subjected to waterboarding, a procedure that simulates drowning. In one session, he ""became completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth."" He was revived and vomited large amounts of water. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, often described as the architect of the 9-11 plots, was waterboarded 183 times over 15 sessions. While King alleged no lasting injuries from this technique, the report indicates otherwise, said David Schanzer, director of the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security at Duke University. ""Methods were approved that if used only very sporadically might not have caused permanent damage, but they were used in combination and repeatedly over a course of sometimes weeks or months,"" Schanzer said. ""I think to write off those kinds of compounded injuries as being insignificant is totally inconsistent with the facts."" Our ruling King said, ""Nobody suffered any lasting injuries"" as a result of the CIA enhanced interrogation program. He also said downplayed the methods, claiming it was ""not a case where people were killed,"" and that the techniques amounted to ""people being made to stand in awkward in positions."" This is the opposite of what the report showed. One need not agree with everything in it to conclude that someone did die, an eye was lost, detainees were made to stand on broken limbs and deprived of sleep for 180 hours. It’s as if King didn’t read the report before he went on the radio. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967E7140>],/factchecks/2014/dec/15/peter-king/peter-king-says-senate-cia-report-found-detainees-/

Cromnibus includes taxpayer funding for group that bankrolled Turkey luxury hotel, Heritage CEO says
","Saturday night, Congress approved a $1.1 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September. It passed with bipartisan support, but not without criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. On Fox News Sunday Dec. 14, Michael Needham, CEO of conservative activist group Heritage Action, said he was disappointed that Congress approved such a massive spending bill, with what he sees as irresponsible provisions. ""They put forth one of the worst pieces of legislation,"" Needham said. ""A $1.1 trillion spending bill that has a carve out for Blue Cross Blue Shield, has a carve out for Wall Street. Reauthorizes something called the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which provides taxpayer-backed loans so that the Four Seasons Hotel can build a resort in Turkey."" We were curious about the last part of Needham’s claim -- that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), a government institution, financed a Four Seasons hotel in Turkey. When we reached out to Needham, his communications team told us that he misspoke -- he meant to say Ritz-Carlton, not the Four Seasons. We consider that to be a minor error that doesn’t distort Needham’s point because both are luxury hotels. That flub aside, we found that Needham’s claim is on target. It is, however, a narrow portrayal of what OPIC does. The hotel in Istanbul (not Constantinople) What’s OPIC? It’s a finance institution run by the federal government. Like a bank, it finances loans with interest and offers political risk insurance. What separates OPIC from other finance institutions, though, is that it helps American businesses break into developing economies -- places where a business might struggle to find private investment locally. For example, OPIC likely wouldn’t back a project in a wealthy country like Austria, where there is plenty of capital available. They would be much more likely to back a project in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2013, OPIC lent $3.75 billion, according to a press release. For 37 consecutive years, the agency has generated a net income for the United States Treasury by collecting interest off its loans and insurance premiums. Supporters say OPIC fosters economic growth in developing nations and benefits American businesses. Opponents, such as Needham, see OPIC as corporate welfare and misuse of tax dollars. In 2000, OPIC gave the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company a $50 million loan to open a hotel in Turkey, which is the project Needham was talking about. (The Four Seasons, we should note, does have a luxury hotel in Istanbul, but OPIC did not finance it.) According to annual reports, OPIC regularly finances hotels and tourism -- in addition to an array of other industries such as manufacturing, renewable energy and agriculture. In 2013, OPIC financed construction of a hotel in South Sudan, as well as hotel expansions in Armenia and the nation of Georgia. Since 2000, the organization has also financed hotels in Iraq, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Liberia, Guatemala, South Africa and more. OPIC spokesman Charles Stadtlander told PolitiFact that the Ritz-Carlton in Turkey is ""well on its way to paying its loan back with interest."" Stadtlander said, though, that Needham mischaracterized the hotel by calling it a ""resort."" He said it is a business-oriented hotel that was built with the idea in mind of bringing CEOs, foreign ministers and investors to Turkey, keeping with OPIC’s economic development mission. The hotel is an ""essential piece of business infrastructure,"" Stadtlander said. Our ruling Needham said OPIC ""provides taxpayer-backed loans so that the Four Seasons hotel can build a resort in Turkey."" The Ritz-Carlton, not the Four Seasons, received a $50 million OPIC loan to build a hotel in Istanbul in 2000. While Needham got the name of the hotel chain wrong, we think most people would forgive mixing up two high-end hoteliers. That said, talking about building hotels overseas doesn’t give the full picture of what OPIC does.

Webb says U.S. has 5 percent of world's population, 25 percent of its ""known"" prisoners
","The United States has too many people in behind bars, says former U.S. Sen. Jim Webb, who’s considering running for president. ""We have 5 percent of the world’s population, 25 percent of the world’s known prison population,"" Webb, a Democrat, said during a Dec. 3 conference with Virginia journalists that was coordinated by the Associated Press. The statement isn’t new to Webb. He cited the same figures during his term in the Senate from 2007-2013 when he introduced unsuccessful legislation to create a National Criminal Justice Commission charged with making recommendations for overhauling the U.S. justice system. We emailed Webb three times asking for the sources of his numbers, but didn’t hear back. So we set out on our own to see whether his statistics on the United States’ outsized prison populations hold up. The same statistical claim has been made by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. The first part of the statement -- the U.S. share of the world’s population -- is pretty much correct. The U.S. has a population of 319.4 million while the global population is about 7.2 billion, according to the Census Bureau. That works out to a 4.4 percent share of the world’s population. The second part -- the United States’ share of the world’s prison population -- comes from the Centre on Prison Studies at the University of Essex in the United Kingdom, which publishes widely cited studies on the global prison population. In its latest report, from October 2013, the center said there were 10.2 million people in penal institutions around the world. The U.S., the center said, had 2.24 million prisoners -- a figure that includes 1.5 million people in state and federal prisons and about 740,000 in local jails. That means the U.S. held nearly 22 percent of the world’s prison population. The center puts a few qualifiers on its figures, which are mostly provided by each country’s national agency overseeing prisons. Not all of the national numbers are complete, particularly for China.  The Chinese government says the nation has 1.64 million prisoners, but an estimated 650,000 more may be serving in pre-trial or ""administrative detention,"" according to the center. Hard figures on the penal populations aren’t released by some nations, including North Korea. There are an estimated 150,000 people living in pre-trial or administrative detention in that country, the center said. If estimates of North Korean prisoners and Chinese tallies for pre-trial detainees are included, then the world penal population is closer to 11 million, the center said. That would mean the U.S. prison population would be 20 percent of the world’s prison population. We note, however, that Webb’s qualified statement said the U.S. had one quarter of the world’s ""known prison population."" It also should be pointed out that the year from which the study tallies prison populations differs from country to country. For example, the U.S. prison population comes from the December 2011 while other countries’ populations were tallied at different times from September 2011 to September 2013. Despite the issues, the center’s list is the most comprehensive tally of the global prison population. Its research has been cited by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- a group of three dozen industrialized nations -- and by the National Academies of Sciences. Michael Rushford is president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, which backs tough criminal sentences. He said the problem with the center’s research is some country’s prison tallies can’t be verified independently and those nations are likely low-balling the size of their penal populations. ""Are we taking communist China’s word on how many people they have in prison? They have no reason to tell us the truth,"" Rushford said. ""It’s easy to verify who is in prison in Great Britain or Switzerland … You try that in North Korea or China or Iran."" Why does the U.S. have a such a high level of incarceration? One large reason -- according to Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, a group seeking to reform justice policies -- is that the U.S. has higher violent crime rates than most industrialized nations, leading to longer prison sentences. Another reason is that the U.S. tends to dole out longer sentences than other nations, he said. An April 2014 report from the National Academies of Sciences said the U.S. prison and jail population in 2012 was 2.23 million -- seven times the number in 1972. The study attributed the growth to several factors, including tough-on-crime policies that created mandatory minimum sentences and increased penalties for drug-related offenses. Although on an upward trend for decades, the level of the U.S. inmates has declined in recent years. A 2013 report by the International Centre for Prison Studies showed the U.S. had the world’s highest incarceration rate at 716 inmates per 100,000 people. Updated figures on the center’s website show the U.S. now has 707 prisoners per 100,000 population, ranking it second behind the island nation of the Seychelles (population 90,595), which has a prison population rate of 868 per 100,000 people. Our ruling Webb says the U.S. has 5 percent of the world’s population but 25 percent of the world’s  ""known prison population."" His numbers are a bit off. The U.S. has 4.4 percent of the world’s population and 22 percent of its prisoners. But we won’t quibble. Webb’s central point holds up: That, when measured in global percentages, the United States’ prison population is five times greater than its general population. We rate Webb’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B9B880>],/factchecks/2014/dec/15/jim-webb/webb-says-us-has-5-percent-worlds-population-25-pe/

Susan Stimpson says Bill Howell has been the force behind major Va. tax hikes
","Susan Stimpson, former chairwoman of the Stafford County Board of Supervisors, recently announced her candidacy for the House of Delegates, challenging House Speaker William Howell in next year’s Republican primary. She said Howell, who has led the House since 2003, has abandoned conservatives. ""Bill Howell has been the consistent force behind every major tax increase in Virginia in the last decade,"" she said in a Dec. 2 news release. ""He has voted for them, he has engineered them and they are his legacy. Simply put, Bill Howell has lost his way and is the chief architect of a tax-and-spend agenda that rewards the politicians and punishes the middle class."" It would be no small feat for Howell to be the force behind every state tax increase of the last decade and still manage to be re-elected as speaker every two years by the House’s Republican majority. So we examined Stimpson’s claim. Tim Edson, Stimpson’s spokesman, sent us vote records, news releases and articles that cover three major tax increase bills in 2004, 2007 and 2013. So let’s enter the Wayback Machine. 2004 Gov. Mark Warner proposed a $700 million a year tax increase to bolster education, public safety and health programs. The Senate went a few leaps further, adding transportation to the mix and approving a tax hike of almost $2 billion a year. Howell voiced opposition to both plans but never voted on them. The transportation bill was killed in the House Finance Committee. The tax standoff led to 115-day impasse in passing a two-year state budget. It was broken after moderate House Republicans crafted a compromise bill for a $615 million tax increase. The bill faced a major hurdle on April 6 when it came before the House Finance Committee. Stimpson points to articles in several newspapers the next day saying the legislation passed on a 10-8 vote after the Howell persuaded four anti-tax Republicans on the panel to skip the meeting. The speaker had been under pressure to allow the full House an opportunity to vote on the measure and, at the time, there appeared to ample votes to still kill it on the floor. A week later, however, the House approved the tax increase on a 52-46 vote when 17 rebellious Republicans joined forces with Democrats. Howell voted against the bill. The tax hike went on to pass the Senate and was signed by Warner. Howell would later strip three Republicans leaders of the tax compromise of some of their appointments to powerful committees and state commissions. 2007 Howell sponsored legislation to raise about $500 million a year for transportation, most of it by diverting funds that had helped pay for other services. But $158 million of the sum would come from raising fees on drivers and imposing heavy penalties on chronically bad drivers. The bill also gave Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads power to raise a combined $600 million more by establishing transportation commissions in their regions that would be authorized to raise taxes. Although the General Assembly approved the legislation, it had short-lived success. Less than a year later, lawmakers repealed the new penalties of bad drivers -- which could exceed $1,000 -- amid a public outcry. And the state Supreme Court struck down the regional transportation authorities, ruling that the legislature cannot delegate taxing power to unelected bodies. 2013 Howell sponsored a successful bill to raise about $750 million annually for transportation. Most of the money comes from a new tax on the wholesale price of gas, an increase in the state sales tax from 5 percent to 5.3 percent, and an increase in the motor vehicle sales tax from 3 percent to 4.3 percent. The bill also imposed a series of regional tax increases in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads -- including an 0.7 percent sales tax hike -- to help the congested areas raise a combined $680 million a year for transportation. Howell said he carried the bill to improve the safety of Virginia roads and because he was concerned transportation problems could undercut Virginia’s ability to recruit new corporations and retain the ones already here. Half of the 66 Republicans in the House voted for the measure, which was also backed by then-Gov. Bob McDonnell, also a Republican. Matt Moran, a spokesman for Howell, reminded us there were several large proposed tax hikes that the speaker opposed. Indeed, records show that Howell either voted or spoke out against $1 billion-plus tax increases former Gov. Tim Kaine unsuccessfully sought in 2006, 2008 and 2010. Our ruling Stimpson says ""Howell has been the consistent force behind every major tax increase in Virginia in the last decade."" She’s right on the transportation tax bills that were passed in 2007 and 2013. Howell sponsored the measures and encouraged fellow House Republicans to vote for them. There’s complexity to the speaker’s role in the passage of the 2004 tax increase for education, public safety and health programs. Howell consistently spoke out against the bill and voted against it.   But the bill survived a hostile House committee because Howell persuaded four conservative allies to skip the vote. This was a political miscalculation by the speaker rather than a nod of support. Howell was under pressure to let the full House vote on the measure. He was outmaneuvered a week later when 17 Republicans joined Democrats to narrowly pass the tax hike. Howell retaliated by stripping leaders of the GOP revolt of some duties. So we find Stimpson’s statement accurate, but in need of this clarification: Howell was an unwitting force behind one of the tax increases. We rate Stimpson’s claim Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D17140>],/factchecks/2014/dec/15/susan-stimpson/susan-stimpson-says-bill-howell-has-been-force-beh/

""Drugged driving"" claim based on flawed data
","Cautions abound from opponents and supporters alike in Georgia’s debate about whether to legalize medical marijuana. The most likely measure to pass is a bill that gained traction last year and is being reintroduced this year by state Rep. Allen Peake, R-Macon, to allow cannabis oil for treatment of certain seizure disorders and other health problems. But a second bill to allow vaporized, edible and smokeable marijuana for medical use has prompted new claims about safety problems and other unintended consequences. Chuck Spahos, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, told a joint legislative committee that no district attorney in the state will prosecute those caught with cannabis oil. But he warned lawmakers about smokeable marijuana, saying that Colorado has seen the number of traffic fatalities go up among drivers who test positive for marijuana, at the same time that state’s overall traffic fatality rate declined. ""Colorado has seen a decrease in traffic fatalities by 14.8 percent between 2007 and 2012,"" Spahos said. ""But it’s up 100 percent for operators who tested positive for marijuana."" ""We don’t want to stand in the way of this oil being available,"" he said. ""This is how bad it’s going to be if we let it go too far."" So did medical marijuana really lead to such a dramatic uptick in stoned drivers? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out. First, it’s important to understand Colorado’s history on the issue. Voters there approved medical marijuana in its smokeable form in 2000. But commercialization of the drug did not really begin until 2009, when federal officials announced they would not seek prosecution of those complying with state medical marijuana laws. Voters approved recreational use of the drug last year. So the statistics Spahos referenced covered just before the rapid growth of marijuana dispensaries but before recreational use was permitted. He cited an August 2014 report from the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Traffic Area as his source. The report is unequivocal. The exact figures cited by Spahos are found in the findings under the report’s section for impaired driving. A chart breaks down the actual numbers: Year Statewide Fatalities Operators Testing Positive 2007 554 39 2008 548 43 2009 465 47 2010 450 49 2011 447 63 2012 472 78 Based on this report, Spahos’ claim appears accurate. However, there are several complications with the data. No one from the RMHIDTA responded to requests for comment. The report cites the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration and its own research for its data. But when contacted, a spokesman for the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration referred us back to the Colorado Department of Transportation for the figures, saying each state reports different information. No federal data could confirm the report’s claim. Meanwhile, the statistics from Colorado’s DOT don’t match the RMHIDTA report. The DOT figures are: Year Statewide Fatalities Drivers Testing Positive 2007 554 26 2008 548 31 2009 465 37 2010 450 42 2011 447 52 2012 474 36 The DOT figures confirm an overall decrease in traffic fatalities, but show about a 39 percent increase for drivers who tested positive for marijuana. That’s still an increase, but hardly a 100 percent jump. More importantly, Colorado DOT spokeswoman Amy Ford said the agency is cautious to use their own data to make any pronouncements. That’s because the data is incomplete. Not every driver in a fatal crash is tested for drugs. Colorado law long allowed a conviction based on just drunken driving – at .08 percent blood alcohol level – so some agencies never bothered with any additional testing. The state only began tracking drugged driving – driving high – this year, so there is no historical data to compare, Ford said. ""We do not draw an incredible amount of conclusions from that data,"" she said. The federal data for all states likewise focuses on drunken, not drugged, drivers. Several studies show that marijuana can slow reaction time and similarly impair drivers in much the way alcohol does. One study found that dead drivers were three times more likely to test positive for cannabis in 2010 when compared to those who died in 1999.  But the marijuana will show up longer in blood work and does not appear to increase the chances of a fatal accident as much as booze, according to a 2013 study by researchers at Columbia University. So if Georgia were to legalize smoking marijuana, does that mean there would not be a rash of high drivers risking their safety and that of others? Colorado’s research indicates specific drivers – essentially young men – are more likely to drive high when the drug is legal. The state has launched a public awareness campaign to the new law that allows police to cite those motorists for driving under the influence, Ford said. In other words, there are clear dangers to driving under the influence of marijuana, much as there are for driving intoxicated. But while a regional report claims that those risks have led to a 100 percent increase in fatal crashes where the driver tested positive for cannabis, official state figures directly contradict those figures. Spahos was citing that published report, but the report and figures surrounding the topic are flawed. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097381E00>],/factchecks/2014/dec/15/charles-chuck-spahos/drugged-driving-claim-base/

Cheney on torture report: Saddam Hussein 'had a 10-year relationship with al-Qaida'
","Former Vice President Dick Cheney has been a consistent defender of past interrogation techniques. ""We are castigating the CIA for doing what the president ordered them to do and the Justice Department said was legal,"" Cheney said on NBC’s Meet the Press, Dec. 14, 2014. For Cheney, the deaths of 3,000 people on 9/11 at the hands of al-Qaida terrorists justified expanded interrogation methods and the subsequent invasion of Iraq. ""We got to the point where we were very concerned about the possible linkage between terrorists on the one hand and weapons of mass destruction on the other,"" Cheney said. ""Saddam Hussein had previously had twice nuclear programs going. He produced and used weapons of mass destruction. And he had a 10-year relationship with al-Qaida."" Cheney and the rest of the administration of President George W. Bush made the link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida a linchpin in its rationale for war. In that light, Cheney’s claim about a 10-year relationship merits a closer look. His statement runs counter to at least two major official inquiries. The 9/11 Commission, an independent, bipartisan body created by Congress and Bush, had the job of writing a complete account of the circumstances surrounding the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Among its tasks: Examine the ties between al-Qaida and Hussein’s regime. The commission found isolated contacts over the years between Iraq and al-Qaida terrorists but nothing more. The commission released its report in 2004. ""To date we have seen no evidence that these or the earlier contacts ever developed into a collaborative operational relationship,"" the report said. ""Nor have we seen evidence indicating that Iraq cooperated with al-Qaida in developing or carrying out any attacks against the United States."" In 2007, the Institute for Defense Analyses, a nonprofit research branch of the Pentagon’s Joint Forces Command, completed its assessment based on over half-a-million captured Iraqi documents. That study ""found no ‘smoking gun’ (i.e., direct connection) between Saddam's Iraq and al-Qaida,"" the analysts wrote. When it suited their goals, both the Hussein regime and al-Qaida leaders might support the same third-party militant groups in different countries, but the researchers said the two parties had little else in common. ""To the fundamentalist leadership of al-Qaida, Saddam represented the worst kind of ‘apostate’ regime,"" they wrote. ""A secular police state well practiced in suppressing internal challenges."" Al-Qaida had good reason to mistrust Hussein. In the mid 1990s, the Iraqi government cracked down and arrested religious extremists who it saw as a threat to Hussein’s power. Peter Neumann is a professor in the War Studies Department at King’s College in London and the author of several books on terrorism. Neumann called Cheney’s statement ""absolutely false."" ""There was no relationship of any kind, and Vice President Cheney, despite making these claims for more than 10 years now, has failed to present any evidence to support it,"" Neumann said. ""He's, as far as I can see, also the only significant person in the Bush administration that's left making this claim."" There are isolated examples where Iraqis operating on their own joined forces with al-Qaida and still maintained contacts with members of the Iraqi military, but there is no sign that the connection was any stronger than that. We tried to reach Cheney through a spokesman and did not hear back. Recently, Cheney said that Hussein either supported or tolerated some fundamentalists who went on to become al-Qaida leaders. The Washington Post Fact Checker looked at Cheney’s evidence in July 2014 and found it lacking. Hussein was ready to encourage extremists when he thought they would destabilize his enemies such as the Kurds in northern Iraq. That’s not the sort of relationship that would tie Iraq to the 9/11 attacks. Our ruling Cheney said Hussein had a 10-year relationship with al-Qaida. Two comprehensive, high-level government reports largely refute that statement. That includes one Pentagon study that relied on a trove of secret Iraqi government documents that fell into American hands after the invasion. While there are cases where the two interests overlapped, there is no evidence of a deep-rooted, meaningful relationship over 10 years as Cheney claimed.  We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968AD3C0>],/factchecks/2014/dec/14/dick-cheney/cheney-torture-report-saddam-hussein-had-10-year-r/

In wake of Senate report, Dick Cheney says terrorists 'not covered by the Geneva Convention'
","Former Vice President Dick Cheney has had a relatively quiet couple of years since leaving the White House. But with the recent release of a Senate report on alleged torture by the CIA, it was inevitable that Cheney -- who is closely associated with the post-9/11 policy of ""enhanced interrogations"" for captured terrorists -- would return to television screens. On Dec. 9, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a report about the CIA’s interrogation techniques in the wake of 9/11. About 500 pages of the 6,700-page report were made public. The report concluded that the techniques were not an effective way to gain intelligence from detainees, and that the CIA misled Congress and the White House. The report detailed such techniques as ""rectal rehydration"" and the use of coffin-size confinement boxes. A few days before a scheduled appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, Cheney sat for an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier. Here’s a portion of their exchange on Dec. 10, focusing on the fate of the detainees discussed in the Senate report. Baier: ""Is there anything to the Geneva Convention, to the world rule of law on this?"" Cheney: ""Sure there is. But remember, the terrorists were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment you would accord to those."" There’s significant disagreement between Cheney and his critics on the issue of torture or ""enhanced interrogation techniques."" Still, experts told us that the question of what protections, if any, the detainees qualified for under the Geneva Convention -- is somewhat more clear-cut than other aspects of this policy debate. So we’ll take a closer look at Cheney’s claim that terrorist detainees ""were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment."" The Geneva Conventions First, some background on the Geneva Conventions. They are a group of four international treaties covering different aspects of how civilians, prisoners of war and soldiers are to be treated once they are rendered incapable of fighting. (Read more about them here.) The most recent version of the treaties in force date from 1949; the United States has ratified all four though it has not ratified some of the protocols added later. The conventions guarantee a certain level of protection for former combatants, including prisoners of war and civilians. They set out in detail the requirements for food, clothing, shelter, safety from combat, access to medical care, and other matters. However, whether fighters could qualify for these protections depended on whether they adhered to some basic rules of law such as wearing uniforms, carrying arms openly, answering to a chain of command, and not committing war crimes. Many of those who would one day end up in Guantanamo Bay and other sites were from non-state terrorist groups and did not adhere to these rules. So these fighters were not guaranteed the same protections afforded POWs. Cheney’s strongest point in his interview with Baier was to draw this distinction between prisoners of war, who receive these extensive protections, and ""unlawful combatants,"" who do not. There is, in fact, a distinction in the level of protection. What undercuts the accuracy of Cheney’s claim, however, is a different part of what he said. It’s misleading for him to say that such combatants are ""not covered by the Geneva Convention."" While detainees who do not have POW status don’t get the top level of protection, they do get more basic protections from the Geneva Conventions. And glossing over those less-stringent protections hides an important point: Even the lower level of protection would have shielded detainees, at least on paper, against some of the harsh treatments now alleged in the Senate report. Experts pointed us to identical passages in each of the four conventions, known as ""Common Article 3."" Among other things""prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever"" by Common Article 3 are ""violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture"" as well as ""outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment."" In other words, despite the implications from what Cheney said, even unlawful combatants ""have minimum protections under the Geneva Conventions,"" Richard D. Rosen, director of the Center for Military Law & Policy at Texas Tech University Law School. The Hamdan decision In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, there was considerable debate inside and outside the Bush administration about how captured members of al-Qaida and the Taliban should be treated. The Bush administration contended that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to terrorism suspects held abroad, siding with White House and Pentagon lawyers over objections from the State Department. Administration lawyers also approved the ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" and said they were legally permissible. The debate about the Geneva Convention piece of the equation ended in June 2006, when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling in Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld, a watershed case on detainee rights. The 5-3 majority wrote that Common Article 3 ""affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory who are involved in a conflict 'in the territory of' a signatory."" In other words, by this decision, ""our own Supreme Court has made it completely clear that, whatever their status, (detainees) are entitled to some minimal protections under the Geneva Convention,"" said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor. ""That ruling is binding law in the United States, no matter what the former vice president says."" University of Notre Dame law professor Mary Ellen O’Connell, a specialist on international law, agreed. ""The Supreme Court's ruling in Hamdan conflicts directly with the vice president’s assertion,"" she said. We will also note that while Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is one source of basic protection for detainees, their rights to these protections may be bolstered by other international agreements as well. One is Article 75 of Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions, which includes minimal protections for all people, whatever their status, who are caught in a conflict. While the U.S. has not ratified this protocol, the U.S. government has said that, ""out of a sense of legal obligation"" it will adhere to Article 75 for ""any individual it detains in an international armed conflict, and expects all other nations to adhere to these principles as well."" And despite resistance during the Bush administration, two other international agreements to which the United States is a party -- the 1984 Torture Convention and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights -- would also prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, experts said.   Our ruling Cheney said that terrorist detainees ""were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment."" Cheney has a point that unlawful combatants are not afforded as high a level of protection as prisoners of war or civilians. However, his comment glosses over the fact that unlawful combatants are still accorded a minimum degree of protection, including a ban on ""violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture,"" and ""outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment,"" both of which have been validated by the Supreme Court. This is an important omission, since some of these very actions have been alleged in the Senate report. Because the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A6FC0>],/factchecks/2014/dec/14/dick-cheney/wake-senate-report-dick-cheney-says-terrorists-not/

Mike Stenhouse: According to HUD, it’s unfair, unjust for wealthy to live in exclusive neighborhoods
","For more than three years, the Rhode Island Division of Planning has been working on RhodeMap RI, a long-term economic development plan meant to help guide efforts to improve the state’s economy. The process, partly financed by a $1.9-million grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),  didn’t get much notice until a nearly 200-page draft of the plan was released in mid-September, igniting a firestorm of controversy. Critics of the plan denounced it as a thinly disguised blueprint for social engineering. If it is implemented, they say, local communities will be forced to cede authority to the federal government on issues such as affordable housing and land use, and individual property rights will be under threat. Supporters, including Governor Chafee and the planners and community leaders who drafted the plan, say it’s a well crafted, comprehensive guide that will help move the state’s economy forward over the decades ahead. They say there’s nothing in the plan that would infringe on individual property rights or local home rule. The debate grew so heated at one meeting a shouting match broke out, with charges of racism and bigotry hurled. And last week, at a meeting of the Statewide Planning Council, opponents called it unconstitutional, socialist and even treasonous. Nonetheless, the council voted unanimously to adopt it. Mike Stenhouse, CEO of the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity, a conservative research group, has led the opposition. A few weeks ago, he talked about the plan on WPRO-AM’s ""The Dan Yorke Show."" Yorke asked Stenhouse to cite a component of the plan ""that highlights what you think is problematic."" ""I’m going to give you my interpretation,"" Stenhouse responded. ""I don’t have their plan in front of me. What we believe, for instance, take Poppasquash Point in Bristol. According to HUD, it is patently unfair and socially unjust that wealthy people can live in an exclusive neighborhood."" We wondered whether Stenhouse was right about HUD’s view of wealthy neighborhoods such as Poppasquash Point, one of the state’s priciest enclaves. When we asked Stenhouse about his statement, he told us he was not directly quoting HUD, but said that his statement was ""an accurate interpretation of HUD’s openly stated intent."" He provided links to multiple documents to support his position. While we don’t view Stenhouse’s statement as a direct quote of HUD policy, we do  believe that listeners who heard Stenhouse’s preface -- ""according to HUD"" -- would assume he was summarizing HUD’s policy. Stenhouse’s backup is comprised primarily of links to a news story and an editorial in Investor’s Business Daily and links to various legal  documents and HUD regulations. The Dec. 13, 2013 news story quoted an official from New York’s Westchester County -- more on Westchester in a moment -- as saying that, in HUD’s view, ""even quarter-acre (lot) single-family zoning …may very well be discriminatory and perpetuate 'segregation."" Stenhouse characterized those comments as ""HUD’s words,"" but they are actually the words of a HUD critic, not the agency itself. The June 20, 2014 editorial criticized HUD’s proposed ""Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing"" rule,  characterizing it as a mechanism to force communities to change zoning laws to allow construction of ""subsidized and other affordable housing to bring more low-income minorities into `white suburbs.’"" But again, these are the words of a HUD critic, not the agency. The other documents largely come from a long-running legal  dispute in Westchester County. In 2006, the Anti-Discrimination Center, a  fair housing advocacy group, sued Westchester County in federal court, arguing the county had defrauded taxpayers by accepting $50 million in HUD grant money while failing to remove barriers to fair housing as required by law. A federal judge ruled in the group’s favor. In 2009, the county reached a landmark settlement agreeing to spend some $50 million to build or acquire 750 affordable-housing units, 630 in communities in which African Americans comprise less than 3 percent of the population and Hispanics make up less than 7 percent. The conflict continues as Westchester County has yet to complete an analysis of local zoning and, thus, has lost more than $20 million in federal grants. Stenhouse highlighted passages in the Westchester settlement agreement that show HUD seeking to enforce the Fair Housing Act by requiring wealthy communities, such as Bedford and Scarsdale, to take steps to increase housing availability for Hispanics, African Americans and low-income residents. The act, adopted in 1968, prohibits discrimination by housing providers, such as landlords and real estate agencies, based on race, religion, sex, national origin, whether a family has children, or disability. Any community that accepts HUD funds must comply with the act. Stenhouse also refers to the federal Community Development Block Grant program regulations and to HUD’s proposed  Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule. Under the rule, communities that receive HUD grants would be required to certify that they’ll work toward analyzing and removing barriers to fair housing. None of the documents, however, show HUD targeting wealthy people or describing exclusive neighborhoods as ""unfair"" or ""unjust."" After reviewing the documents Stenhouse provided, we came to two conclusions. First, it is clear that HUD and the federal government say it is illegal for communities to enact zoning and other ordinances that, in effect, exclude low-income, minority and other protected groups. Second, HUD’s policies relate to the planning and zoning actions of governing bodies, not the personal actions of individuals. We found nothing in the documents to support Stenhouse’s claim. We also reached out to national housing experts and academics specializing in housing law. Four got back to us. None agreed with Stenhouse’s characterization of HUD’s regulations. ""I’ve never seen that language used by HUD or anyone at HUD,"" said Daniel Lauber, past president of the American Planning Association and of the American Institute of Certified Planners and current president of Planning/Communications, a national firm that assists communities with land-use issues. The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule and Community Development Block Grant regulations ""are all aimed at removing barriers to fair housing that artificially force segregation on us,"" Lauber said. Such obstacles include discriminatory real estate practices; zoning policies imposing large lot sizes; and artificially increasing the cost of housing. ""When they enter into these contracts to take HUD money, they know they are going to have to further fair housing."" (Bristol, home of the wealthy neighborhood Stenhouse mentioned, received $655,615 Community Development Block Grants through HUD from 2011 to 2013, according to the state Division of Planning.) According to David Reiss, a professor of real estate and housing policy at Brooklyn Law School, ""HUD does not interpret the FHA [Fair Housing Act] to mean that `wealthy people’ can’t `live in an exclusive neighborhood.’"" ""An exclusive neighborhood is an expensive one – the FHA does not ban expensive neighborhoods."" Reiss continued in an email statement. ""What it does do is ban exclusionary practices.  Exclusionary practices are those that exclude people based on certain of their characteristics such as their race, sex or religion.  To my knowledge, HUD has never taken the position that merely living in an exclusive – that is, expensive -- neighborhood violates the FHA."" We also asked HUD whether Stenhouse had accurately characterized its rules. ""There are simply no policies, practices, regulations or anything that can validate such hyper hyperbole,"" Brian Sullivan, a public affairs officer with HUD, said in an email statement. Our ruling Mike Stenhouse said ""According to HUD, it is patently unfair and socially unjust that wealthy people can live in an exclusive neighborhood."" There’s no doubt that HUD has challenged what it considers to be discriminatory practices at the community level, including exclusionary zoning ordinances. But that’s not nearly the same as objecting to the right of wealthy people to live in expensive neighborhoods. We rule Stenhouse’s claim False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809738DE80>],/factchecks/2014/dec/14/mike-stenhouse/mike-stenhouse-according-hud-its-unfair-unjust-wea/

Can a single parent in Wisconsin easily get $35,000 per year in government benefits?
","Once it became clear that Wisconsin Republican Glenn Grothman would win a U.S. House seat in the November 2014 elections, his penchant for making provocative statements gained national attention. So much so that, after Grothman claimed the seat held for 35 years by Tom Petri, we decided to publish an In Context article fleshing out five of his most biting sound bites. It quickly became one of our most popular items of the year. But while those statements were more opinion than fact, Grothman has also taken his turn on our Truth-O-Meter. He earned a True, for example, for saying a study showed that children who lived with a biological parent and the parent’s partner were 20 times more likely to be sexually abused. On Nov. 30, 2014, the congressman-elect made another statement that made us stop and say, ""Really?"" In an interview on ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" a statewide public affairs show on WISN-TV in Milwaukee, Grothman said welfare reform would be one of his priorities in Washington. Saying the first step is to educate people about benefits, he declared: ""A single parent with a couple kids can easily get $35,000 a year in total benefits between the healthcare and the earned income credit and the FoodShare and the low-income housing and what-have-you."" Grothman went on to say that amount is a ""bribe not to work that hard or a bribe not to marry somebody with a full-time job."" We wondered how easy it is for a single parent in Wisconsin to get $35,000 a year in state and federal benefits. Grothman’s evidence Grothman based his claim on a September 2012 memo from the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The bureau is a well-respected nonpartisan scorekeeper of state budget matters. But it’s important to note this memo responded to a specific request Grothman made in his capacity as a state senator, rather than something the bureau produced on its own. Lawmakers often make requests of the bureau, but the way they tailor their requests can limit the bureau's analysis. Indeed, the memo was titled: ""Value of (state and federal) public assistance and student financial aid benefits and tax credits available to two hypothetical families."" Both hypothetical families rented a three-bedroom apartment in West Bend (the Milwaukee suburb where Grothman then lived), had two children -- ages 3 and 7 -- and had no health insurance through an employer. The difference was that one hypothetical family was a single parent working part-time, earning $10,000 per year, and going to technical college full-time. The other example was a married couple. One parent worked full-time and the other worked part-time while attending technical college full-time. They earned $50,000 per year. When the Washington Post Fact Checker checked Grothman’s claim, it said Grothman based his $35,000 figure on what the memo estimated the single parent could potentially receive in two categories: public assistance and tax benefits. That is, more than $29,000 in public assistance --  including child care subsidies, rent assistance and food stamps -- and more than $5,000 in tax credits. When we spoke to Grothman, he cited different tallies from the memo. In addition to public assistance and tax benefits, the memo also did calculations in two more categories: student aid for the parent attending technical college and BadgerCare health care benefits. The grand totals for all four categories of benefits were vastly different. Roughly $47,000 for the single mother (again, public assistance being the largest category). And roughly $8,000 for the married couple (from student aid and health benefits, no public assistance). Although the difference between the two grand totals is about $39,000, Grothman said he claimed $35,000 just to give himself a ""cushion."" And he said the intent of his claim was to highlight what he called the ""marriage penalty"" -- lower benefits for a married couple versus a single parent. Regardless of how Grothman explained the figure to the Fact Checker and to us, either way, there are problems with his characterization of the $35,000. Understanding the figure  As the Fact Checker pointed out: ""It’s easy to pick and choose what would make up a person’s ‘welfare package,’ and tack a number to it. This is essentially what Grothman did"" in requesting the memo. The Fact Checker gave Grothman ""two Pinocchios,"" the second-lowest of their five ratings, for a claim that contains ""significant omissions and/or exaggerations."" Grothman argued to us that his examples weren’t cherry picked -- that a single parent with two children is common, and so are the vast majority of benefits the single parent could receive, including child care, health care and food stamps. But in its memo, the fiscal bureau was careful to say ""no data exist on the number of households that may actually be receiving the combination of tax and program benefits"" listed for the hypothetical families. The memo added: ""Although the number of families who would qualify for all of the benefits described in this memorandum is unknown, it is likely to be quite small relative to the state’s overall population."" One other point: Grothman made his claim in the context of reducing ""welfare"" benefits. But while some of the assistance he cites, such as food stamps, might commonly be considered to be welfare, other benefits -- including tax credits and student aid -- are not.    Our rating Grothman said: ""A single parent with a couple kids can easily get $35,000 a year"" in public assistance in Wisconsin. On one level, Grothman is using a common example in terms of a single parent with two children, but his use of the word ""easily"" goes too far. The very analysis he cites as evidence concludes that only a small  percentage of Wisconsin residents would qualify for all of the various child care subsidies, housing aid, food stamps and tax benefits that Grothman cites. Our rating is Mostly False.

Kristof: U.S. imprisons blacks at rates higher than South Africa during apartheid
","The primary debate over race in this country seems to be whether the country needs to have a debate at all. Polls show white and black Americans have markedly different views of where the problems lie. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof has written a series of articles called ""When whites just don’t get it."" Kristof applauded the progress in race equality America has achieved, but he basically argued that whites don’t know what life is like for blacks, and he presented many stats to show that great inequality remains. Comedy Central’s The Daily Show aired video of Kristof making his case Dec. 4. ""The United States right now incarcerates more African-Americans as a percentage than apartheid South Africa did,"" Kristof said in the clip. Numbers on the American side are easier to come by and are straightforward. Kristof cited an Aspen Institute report that said, ""The United States imprisons a larger percentage of its black population than South Africa did at the height of apartheid."" The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that, in 2010, the incarceration rate for black men in all of the country’s jails and prisons was 4,347 people per 100,000. For whites, the rate was 678 people per 100,000. America imprisons people far more in general than comparable countries. Among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations, the United States is the clear leader with an incarceration rate about two and half times higher than the second place country, Chile. Precise numbers from South Africa during the apartheid years are more elusive. As a refresher, apartheid was South Africa’s policy of strict segregation and differential treatment of people according to their race. It became fully part of South African law in 1950 with passage of the Population Registration Act. That law dovetailed with other bills to anchor race-based controls. For instance, the Lands Act set aside about 87 percent of property for whites, and the Group Areas Act forbid nonwhites from living in white-designated zones. The 1950 legislation involved a set of ""pass laws,"" so called because they created an internal passport system that supported the forced segregation. The apartheid era lasted more than 40 years, ending in 1991 with the repeal of the apartheid laws. William Worger, professor of history at the University of California-Los Angeles, is a longtime researcher of the apartheid era. Worger said the pass laws did much to fill the prisons. ""Most of the arrests and imprisonment in South Africa were for pass laws offences,"" Worger told PunditFact. ""The incarceration rate in South Africa in 1984 -- the midst of apartheid -- was 440 persons imprisoned per 100,000 population. Blacks comprised around 94 percent of those incarcerated."" Based on Worger’s numbers, that would translate to an imprisonment rate of 612 per 100,000 for blacks in 1984. A report from the advocacy group The Sentencing Project found an incarceration rate of 851 black South Africans per 100,000 in 1993 (two years after the end of apartheid). The figure tracks back to a 1993 report of the South African Correctional Services. The report combined the categories of ""black"" and ""colored"" to produce the black male rate of incarceration. That’s two snapshots over a span of a decade, but it’s the best we have. In both cases, the numbers don’t begin to approach the current U.S. incarceration rate of African-American males. Whatever the limits in these data, the relative numbers for South Africa and the United States hold up, simply based on the number of beds in the South African prison system. In 1992, according to a report by University of Cape Town researchers, the country housed about 109,000 inmates in space designed for about 88,000. While overcrowding was known to have been worse before 1992, the black imprisonment rate could not have come close to today’s American rate simply due to limited room. There’s something of an international theme in countries comparing themselves to apartheid South Africa. We found Australian journalists drawing the same contrast relative to rates of imprisonment in their country. Our ruling Kristof said that America puts African-Americans behind bars at a higher rate than South Africa did under apartheid. Based on the known evidence, that appears to be correct. In 2010, the black male incarceration rate in the United States was 4,347 people per 100,000 in the United States. That comes nowhere close to reported incarceration rates of blacks in South Africa during and immediately after the apartheid era. We rate the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809738D200>],/factchecks/2014/dec/11/nicholas-kristof/kristof-us-imprisons-blacks-rates-higher-south-afr/

Steve Adler says San Antonio recycles 40 percent of water, Austin only 5 percent
","An Austin mayoral candidate suggested the Texas capital greatly lags the Alamo City in a wet way. In a Nov. 19, 2014, Time Warner Cable News debate with his Dec. 16, 2014, runoff opponent, Mike Martinez, Steve Adler said: ""The city of San Antonio reuses almost 40 percent of its water. You know how much the city of Austin reuses? About 5 percent. And that's not right. We can do better."" Adler has talked up San Antonio before; in his September 2014 water agenda, he pointed out San Antonio’s wide lead in water reuse, and advocated reforming Austin’s ""purple pipe"" system (state law requires pipes carrying non-potable treated wastewater be colored purple). It’s no light topic. Texas’ 2012 State Water Plan, a 50-year strategy for keeping water supply up with demand, says the state must quadruple its use of reused (or recycled) water, adding over 300 billion gallons to yearly supply by 2060.   To clarify: Water reuse doesn’t necessarily mean sending purified toilet water to the tap (as Wichita Falls does). Cities normally discharge treated wastewater, not fit to drink, into a local river, but some reuse it for irrigation or industry. San Antonio is recognized as an innovator in water conservation, but in looking into Adler’s statement, we found his comparison doesn’t match apples to apples. That is, San Antonio uses most of its recycled water in ways that Austin cannot: It fills its urban rivers with recycled water and sends recycled water to power plants just a few miles downriver. The comparison also is flawed because the cities already pipe about the same percentage of recycled water through purple pipes to city customers for irrigation and industry. Adler’s data To launch this check, we queried Jim Wick, Adler’s campaign manager, on the candidate’s statistics. He provided information received on April 11, 2014 by an Adler supporter, William Moriarty, who is also a member of Austin’s Water and Wastewater Commission. Moriarty had requested water recycling statistics from the Austin Water Utility, which serves more than 890,000 customers in Austin and surrounding communities, and the San Antonio Water System, which serves more than 1.6 million customers in Bexar and surrounding counties. -Austin Water division manager Raj Bhattarai said Austin’s wastewater treatment plants treated 33.84 billion gallons in 2013, of which 1.47 billion gallons, or 4.3 percent, were reused. -SAWS senior resource analyst Gregg Eckhardt said San Antonio’s wastewater treatment plants treated 45.22 billion gallons in 2013, of which 16.2 billion gallons, or about 35 percent, were reused. Eckhardt said 75 percent of the reused water was sent via the San Antonio River to power plants downstream, 15 percent was piped to city customers and 10 percent was added to urban waterways to boost flows. But a July 2014 email, also provided by Wick, threw up a flag; Eckhardt told the Adler campaign that the state, unlike SAWS, doesn’t consider water pumped to boost streamflow to be reused. Put another way, not counting flow augmentation, San Antonio reuses about 32 percent of its wastewater. This turn made us wonder: what else are the cities reporting as reused water?  It was here that we learned about water delivered both via big rivers and purple pipes. Purple pipes Daryl Slusher, an Austin Water Utility administrator, said by phone Austin’s reuse tally only includes water piped from wastewater treatment plants to customers. Austin’s 48 miles of purple pipes serve 69 customers for recycled water including golf courses, city parks and Austin Energy, according to a utility spokesman, Jason Hill, who also said the number of customers the utility could serve was capped by ""infrastructure limitations."" Meaning? The city has to build more purple pipes. The Austin American-Statesman reported in December 2009 that Austin then planned to spend $180 million expanding the purple pipe system -- over three decades. Adler’s web-posted water agenda says city policies make it costly for irrigation customers currently using drinking water to switch to recycled water. By email, Wick told us Adler supports an exemption to the purple-color requirement for irrigators who already have underground networks of white-colored pipes and want to use recycled water. Then again, we realized, the Austin City Council on Nov. 14, 2014, adopted an ordinance doing just that: allowing irrigators to use recycled water without replacing existing pipe networks. So, is Adler’s plan already moot? Not quite, Wick said by email, adding that Adler believes the city’s already-approved expansion of purple pipes should be completed more quickly than planned. San Antonio also sends recycled water through purple pipes. In fact, a 2013 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report called San Antonio’s 110 miles of purple pipe ""the nation’s largest direct recycled water delivery system."" Eckhardt told us customers include golf courses, conference center air-conditioning cooling towers, computer server-farm cooling systems, Trinity University and factories like a Toyota truck plant.  Map of San Antonio’s recycled water system, including purple pipe, taken with permission from Eckhardt’s The Edwards Aquifer Website. CPS Energy pumps water from its station on the San Antonio River to fill Braunig and Calaveras lakes, cooling reservoirs for power plants. According to Eckhardt, 5 percent of San Antonio’s treated wastewater was pumped to city customers through purple pipes in 2013. According to Hill, about 4 percent of Austin’s treated water was pumped back through the purple pipes that year. So if San Antonio hardly outperforms Austin in getting recycled water to city customers, how does San Antonio lay claim to recycling so much more wastewater The difference is almost all about whether water put in a river should be counted as recycled. Power plants In 2013, SAWS sent 12.2 billion gallons of recycled water--83 percent of the utility’s total reported water reuse--about four miles down the San Antonio River to three Bexar County CPS Energy power plants, which are not linked to the purple pipe, according to SAWS communications manager Anne Hayden. Eckhardt said San Antonio was the world’s first city to fill power plant cooling reservoirs with treated wastewater. Previously, he said, the plants were cooled with drinking-quality water. Austin likewise dumps its treated wastewater into the Colorado River. And likewise, a multitude of downstream users pump water from the river, including the Fayette Power Project 83 miles downstream and the South Texas Nuclear Project about 150 miles downstream. But unlike in San Antonio, the plants don’t exclusively use treated wastewater; The Lower Colorado River Authority also sends water from the Highland Lakes, upstream reservoirs that also supply Austin, said LCRA spokeswoman Clara Tuma by email. She said treated wastewater discharged by Austin ""is available for use by all senior water rights holders downstream who may need the water,"" including cities and irrigation districts. Downstream users consume enough that not much water from Austin actually even makes it to the coast at Matagorda Bay, where river flow has dwindled to record lows. But Slusher said the Austin utility doesn’t count downstream use as reuse because unlike SAWS, Austin loses ownership of water it releases into the river, which becomes property of the LCRA. Robert Mace, executive administrator at the Texas Water Development Board, said SAWS’ transfer of water to CPS counts as reuse because the San Antonio utility has a contract to provide the water. He said: ""Water that's put back into river without some sort of formal agreement is referred to in the reuse subculture as ‘de facto reuse'"" and is not credited to any utility. Another key detail: San Antonio lives on groundwater, and SAWS pumps aquifer water to fill the San Antonio River, unlike Austin which gets water from upstream. Absent SAWS’ treated wastewater, Eckhardt said the power plants would have to use drinking-quality aquifer water. Filling streams and rivers As it turns out, indeed, most of San Antonio’s creeks and rivers would run dry without the city’s treated wastewater, including the waterways along the downtown Riverwalk, said Hayen with SAWS. Hayden said San Antonio pumps about 5 million gallons of treated wastewater a day to keep the San Antonio River flowing, supporting tourism downtown and ecosystems downstream. Eckhardt said he considers flow augmentation reuse because before treated wastewater ran through San Antonio rivers, they were fed by wells pumping drinking-quality water from the Edwards Aquifer, which of late no longer need to pump. State water authority By phone, Mace said there were no statewide guidelines regulating what a utility could or could not report as water reuse. However, he said a 2013 TWDB water reuse survey did not count water used for streamflow boosts in San Antonio. The survey, which only reports recycled water customers within city limits, found Austin reused 3-3.5 percent of its wastewater that year while San Antonio reused 19-24 percent. However, Mace said, excluding recycled water sent to CPS power plants, San Antonio reused 3-3.8 percent of its wastewater. Our ruling Adler said San Antonio reuses 40 percent of its water while Austin reuses just 5 percent, indicating that the capital should catch up to its sprawling southern neighbor. Those percentages are offered by the respective local water utilities. However, both cities have been piping about the same share of treated water to local industrial and irrigation customers. This statement failed to acknowledge that San Antonio lays claim to even more recycling in ways Austin cannot match. This is mainly because, unlike San Antonio, Austin doesn’t own any of the treated wastewater it pours into its major river (while SAWS owns the water it puts into the San Antonio River). We rate this comparison Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
