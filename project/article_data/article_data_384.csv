Analysis bashing DHS COVID-19 calculations is built on errors, omissions
","A surge in coronavirus cases in September pushed Wisconsin near the top of a dubious national ranking — most new COVID-19 cases per capita. Predictably, that spurred a related jump in the percentage of COVID-19 tests yielding positive results in the state. The rise has prompted renewed scrutiny of the state’s COVID-19 response. Some claim this is proof Gov. Tony Evers’ mask mandate isn’t working, while others say it means we aren’t taking the threat — or the mask mandate — seriously enough. But the conservative MacIver Institute took another tack, zeroing in on the formula used to establish the positivity rate to claim that errors by the state Department of Health are what is actually causing the increase in that key measure. ""Bad Math Driving Wisconsin’s Exploding Positive Test Rate,"" declared a Sept. 23, 2020, headline that was shared widely on social media. The MacIver story went on to make a series of claims building on that thesis: ""A fundamental flaw in how the Evers’ Administration calculates Wisconsin’s daily COVID-19 positive test rate has excluded hundreds of thousands of test results and led to a wildly distorted picture of the state’s progress in confronting the virus,"" said the story’s first paragraph. It later quoted Ryan Westergaard, DHS chief medical officer, as explaining the positivity rate is calculated by dividing the number of positive cases by the number of people tested — not the total number of tests. The MacIver piece calls this a ""shocking admission.""  But it’s only shocking if you haven’t been paying close attention. This is how DHS has consistently calculated test positivity, and since mid-August the department has even explicitly laid this out in the COVID-19 dashboard. What’s more, it’s an acceptable way — even the preferred way, by some — to do the calculation, since it weeds out multiple tests of the same person. Here’s why this ""bad math"" claim is ridiculous. The most obvious error in this claim is blaming math for the ""exploding positive test rate."" The seven-day average of tests with positive results — a more reliable marker than daily totals since it smooths out daily jumps caused by changes in testing volume — rose slowly through August, from about 6% to 8%. It then spiked starting in September, pushing the seven-day average close to 20% by the end of the month. The MacIver piece posits this is due to errant calculations. But this rate has been calculated the same way throughout this entire stretch. So whatever one’s objections to the methodology, if the same formula is used at the beginning and the end of a given time period, and the rate increases dramatically in that span, the increase is real. The MacIver piece notes in its critique that test positivity is important because it’s one of six so-called ""gating"" criteria Evers is using to shape state policy on the pandemic. If test positivity is being used incorrectly, that would make it harder to achieve the thresholds set by Evers, and for the state to reopen fully. Test positivity is, indeed, one of the criteria.  But the MacIver implication that it lacks legitimacy falls flat. The criteria doesn’t call for a specific percentage level to be met. Rather it calls for a downward trajectory for 14 days. And, as we noted, the same measuring stick — the formula — has been used throughout. That brings us to the heart of this claim, that DHS is using ""bad math"" in calculating the percentage of positive tests. The MacIver piece itself elaborates on this, asserting, ""If the goal is to calculate the daily positive test rate, then DHS is using the wrong numerator and denominator."" DHS calculates percent positivity by dividing the number of people with positive test results by the number of people tested in a given span. (Their dashboard includes daily counts as well as a seven-day and 14-day average.) The MacIver piece asserts this is incorrect, saying the state should instead be basing the calculation off the raw number of tests, which would deliver a lower percentage. But the state’s approach is actually both widely used and preferred because it prevents people who are tested often from skewing the data.  These aren’t people who feel sick or exhibit symptoms and seek a test — the typical sort of person tested. Rather, these are people who are tested regularly based on their position (such as a front-line health care worker) or situation (such as living in a nursing home where an outbreak has occurred). Counting each of those negative test results would give an unrealistic picture of how frequently positive tests are occurring in the population — the core question all testing is trying to answer. ""Our data report individuals tested,"" Westergaard said in a June 11, 2020, media briefing. ""So, if an individual was tested more than once because they were being followed to see if they cleared the infection or if they were tested a couple times weeks apart, they would be considered a single case and not multiple cases in our data."" Johns Hopkins University, which operates a COVID dashboard has become a go-to national resource in the pandemic, endorses this approach. Officials there said some places aren’t using it only because their data doesn’t allow them to break it down this way. ""We feel that the ideal way to calculate positivity would be number of people who test positive divided by number of people who are tested,"" says an explainer posted on the Johns Hopkins dashboard. ""We feel this is currently the best way to track positivity because some states include in their testing totals duplicative tests obtained in succession on the same individual, as well as unrelated antibody tests. However, many states are unable to track number of people tested, so they only track number of tests."" The CDC also notes this is a standard way of approaching test positivity calculations. Their website lists it as one of three formulas used by various agencies. The CDC calculates positivity by dividing the number of positive tests by the total number of tests taken. It notes it only uses this approach because it doesn’t have access to the data state and local health departments have to identify  — and separate out  — repeat tests from the same individual. Some states divide the number of people with positive tests by the total number of tests taken. Some states use Wisconsin’s approach, dividing the number of people with positive tests by the number of people tested. The New York Times — which also runs a  COVID dashboard  — notes at least 18 states report tests like Wisconsin, based on the number of people tested, rather than the number of tests. None of this national context was included in the MacIver piece. DHS spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt said Sept. 29, 2020, the agency was in the process of launching an updated dashboard that shows test positivity calculated using both approaches — number of people and number of tests. She said both measures ""are informative to the response effort in Wisconsin.""  One more quick note for some general context on this metric. The COVID Tracking Project, another dashboard operator, said in a Sept. 22, 2020, blog post that test positivity is useful but also ""one of the most commonly misunderstood metrics for monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic."" It notes percent positivity rates can vary greatly based on who officials decide to test. ""The choice of who gets tested is based on state- or county-specific criteria, but is often made based on how sick people appear to be, which in turn influences test positivity,"" the blog post said. ""If a state only tests people who have clear symptoms of the virus, it will likely have a higher test positivity than one that is also testing asymptomatic people."" A MacIver article widely shared on Facebook says ""bad math"" is to blame for Wisconsin’s ""exploding positive test rate."" This is wrong on multiple fronts.They’re asserting manipulated math is behind the increase in test positivity, but it’s actually because the number of people testing positive has risen based on human behavior.  There is no ""bad math."" The state DHS uses a methodology (tallying people tested rather than raw tests) that is widely used by health agencies around the country. It is considered a more accurate approach because it assures people who are tested on a regular, even daily, basis — such as health care workers — don’t skew the data. And whatever the quibbles with the methodology, this wouldn’t cause the increase in the test positivity rate because the formula DHS used to calculate the rate was the same throughout the time period. That makes this claim both false and ridiculous, or as we call it, Pants on Fire. Note: DHS updated their COVID-19 dashboard Sept. 30, the day after this story published, to include test positivity in terms of both tests and people. That does not affect the rating for this item since the per-person method remains on the DHS website and remains an acceptable and even preferred approach. ",/factchecks/2020/sep/29/maciver-institute/analysis-bashing-dhs-covid-19-calculations-built-e/

No, Pepsi didn’t omit ‘under God’ from the Pledge of Allegiance on can design
","Pepsi has come under fire for nearly two decades for its supposed decision to release cans showing an excerpt from the Pledge of Allegiance — minus the phrase ""under God."" And yet, Pepsi never has issued such a can, nor has it ever announced plans to do so.

""Don’t buy the new Pepsi can coming out with pics of the Empire State building and the Pledge of Allegiance on them. Pepsi left out 2 little words in the pledge ‘Under God.’ Pepsi said they didn't want to offend anyone.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claims in the post are false and have been around since 2002. Pepsi has never released a can that featured the Empire State Building and/or a truncated excerpt from the Pledge of Allegiance. These inaccurate claims against Pepsi appeared after Dr Pepper unveiled a can in November 2001— in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks — that featured an image of the Statue of Liberty and the words, ""One Nation … Indivisible."" At the time, Dr Pepper was owned by Cadbury Schweppes PLC not PepsiCo, Inc., which owned Pepsi. Pepsi and Dr Pepper were separate companies 2001 and remain separate today.  At one point, Pepsi released a statement titled, ""False rumor alert: patriotic cans,"" according to Snopes.com. ""You’ve received an erroneous email about a ""patriotic can"" that Pepsi allegedly produced with an edited version of America’s Pledge of Allegiance. The truth is, Pepsi never produced such a can,"" the statement said. ""A patriotic package used in 2001 by Dr Pepper (which is not a part of PepsiCo) was inappropriately linked to Pepsi."" Cadbury Schweppes also issued a statement noting that its patriotic Dr Pepper can in fact left out most of the 31 total words in the pledge:  ""The special packaging was designed to reflect our pride in this country's determination to stand together as one. The Statue of Liberty and Pledge of Allegiance were chosen as two of the greatest symbols of American freedom. Only three words were used from the Pledge of Allegiance. Those three words were in concert with the patriotic mood of the nation.""  The limited edition patriotic can was retired in February 2002 and would not be used again, the statement said.

No, Merrick Garland isn’t investigating Donald Trump for tax evasion
","In 2016, Senate Republicans refused to hold a confirmation hearing for Merrick Garland, then-President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.  The seat was eventually filled by Neil Gorsuch, whom President Donald Trump nominated after taking office. Garland, shut out, kept his post as chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  But reports suggesting a possible Garland score-settling were off base. And Garland is not investigating a tax evasion case against Trump, as a recent Facebook post claims.  ""Holy Cow!"" begins the post before referring obliquely to the president. ""Guess who’s investigating Turnip’s tax evasion case? None other than … Merrick Garland. I know he’ll be utterly fair. It’s just kind of sweetly karmic that it’s his case.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  First, Trump has not been charged with tax evasion. The Manhattan district attorney’s office recently suggested in a court filing that it has grounds to investigate the president and his business for tax fraud, but that’s a case over the president’s financial records that’s being fought in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  The claim in this Facebook post appears to stem from efforts by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to review Trump’s financial information. In April 2019, the committee subpoenaed several years of the president’s financial information from Mazars, an accounting firm that prepared Trump’s financial statements. The request came after Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, claimed Trump had inflated his net worth as he unsuccessfully tried to buy the Buffalo Bills football team.  Trump responded by suing the accounting firm and the House committee’s chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., to keep the records private. U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Congress was within its rights to request the records as part of an investigation into whether the president illegally inflated or deflated amounts on his financial statements.   Trump appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where Garland served as chief judge.  At the time, publications such as Newsweek reported that Trump’s ""subpoena appeals now head to Merrick Garland’s court."" Vanity Fair published a story with the headline: ""Trump begs Merrick Garland to keep his financial lies private."" The magazine also tweeted the story, writing: ""Trump’s fate now rests in the hands of Merrick Garland, the judge whose Supreme Court seat Republicans effectively stole.""  Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, took issue with that framing.  ""Dear internet,"" he tweeted at the time. ""Chief Judge Garland is one of 11 active judges, and 17 judges total who currently hear appeals on the D.C. Circuit as part of three-judge panels. The odds that his case goes to a panel including Garland, specifically, are … modest."" And in fact, the case didn’t wind up with Garland. In October, a three-judge panel ruled 2-1 that the House committee could subpoena Trump’s records. Garland was not on the panel. Two judges appointed by Democratic presidents — David Tatel and Patricia Millett — wrote the ruling for the court. Judge Neomi Rao, who was appointed by Trump, dissented. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in July that the House can subpoena the records if it meets rigorous standards. The Supreme Court then kicked the case back to the appeals court for further review. It’s now being briefed again before the three-judge panel, Vladeck told us.  The panel does not include Garland, who stepped down as chief judge in February but continues to serve on the court.  ""The only way he’d even be involved in this case at this juncture is if it goes before the en banc (full) court rather than the three-judge panel, which seems more than a little unlikely,"" Vladeck said in an email.  We rate this Facebook post False.",/factchecks/2020/sep/29/facebook-posts/no-merrick-garland-isnt-investigating-donald-trump/

Biden ad compares Trump’s taxes with nurses, firefighters
","Joe Biden’s campaign seized on a report that Donald Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and in 2017. Hours after the New York Times broke its story, based on a review of two decades’ worth of the president’s tax returns, the Biden campaign posted a 30-second ad comparing Trump’s reported tax bill with the taxes paid by certain categories of essential workers. In the ad, a series of faces appear on screen as text cites the ""typical income tax"" of an elementary school teacher ($7,239), a firefighter ($5,238), a construction manager ($16,447), and a registered nurse ($10,216).  Finally, the ad shows footage of Donald Trump exiting Air Force One, with the text: ""Federal income taxes paid: Donald Trump, $750."" The $750 figure in the ad is based on the Times’ reporting on Trump’s 2017 return. We haven’t seen Trump’s tax returns ourselves, since he hasn’t released them to the public. (He’s the only major-party presidential nominee in modern times not to do so.) The Times said it obtained the tax returns from someone who had lawful access to them, but would not publish them in order to protect its source’s identity. A lawyer for the Trump Organization, the umbrella group for the president’s private business interests, challenged the Times’ reporting, writing in a statement that ""over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015.""  The Times noted that the attorney’s statement appeared to conflate income taxes with other federal taxes such as Social Security and Medicare taxes, and the company did not furnish any documents to substantiate its claim. As for the ""typical income tax"" comparison for other workers, the Biden ad didn’t cite a specific source. The fine print on the ad says only that this information was based on ""2019 data,"" but doesn’t go into detail. So we were curious about where the campaign got these numbers. It turns out the tax amounts cited in the ad aren’t sourced from a federal tax agency. Rather, to calculate the typical income taxes for various professions, the Biden campaign took the annual mean wages of those professions as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and then used H&R Block’s tax calculator to estimate an income tax bill.  Whether that bill qualifies as ""typical"" is not clear. The calculations used in the ad were based on an estimate of what a 40-year-old single person (not head of household) would owe. Elaine Maag, principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, noted that various factors — whether someone is single or married, how many children they have, and whether they took standard or itemized deductions — affect the income taxes a person pays. Single people without children, who don’t qualify for tax credits and exemptions for children and dependents, will generally pay more in federal taxes than married couples or families with children. In 2016, middle-income households making about $60,000 a year paid $2,200 in federal income taxes, according to the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan governmental agency. That’s far less than the amounts cited for any of the professions in the Biden ad. Since the Biden campaign didn’t take these variations into account when making its calculation, the income taxes it cites in the ad are not so much ""typical"" as they are guesses for a certain segment of taxpayers in those professions.  Mark Mazur, former assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy and director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said that the Biden campaign’s calculations ""get you in the general ballpark"" of the real income tax average by profession, but that a more precise measure would also have taken household makeup into account.  It would be more accurate to say that the Biden campaign calculated the tax of ""a 40-year-old single person, whose only income comes from his job,"" he said in an interview.  In addition, Mazur noted that the Biden campaign used a 2019 tax calculator rather than a tax calculator for 2016 or 2017, the years for which Trump reportedly paid $750.  Despite the holes in the comparison, tax experts agreed that the general thrust of the ad is accurate based on the Times’ reporting.  ""Most Americans are paying way more than $750,"" said Mazur.  According to Vox, a single adult with no children and making as little as $17,900 in 2017 would have paid $750 in income tax.  A Biden ad compared the amount of federal income tax Trump reportedly paid in 2017 with the ""typical income tax"" paid by categories of essential workers.  According to tax policy experts, the Biden campaign used incomplete data to arrive at the amounts for the ""typical income tax"" paid by essential workers. The figures were based on tax estimates for single taxpayers with no children or dependents, or other sources of taxable income, and it didn’t account for workers in other filing categories. But the experts said the general thrust of the ad is accurate: Most Americans paid far more than $750 in federal income taxes.  The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

Molly Gray’s claim she voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 is false
","As the country presses toward an election defined by disagreement over the current president, whether or not candidates voted for or against Donald Trump in 2016 is a basic political litmus test in 2020.  Molly Gray, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, seemed to understand that when she proclaimed at a debate last week, ""I proudly voted for Hillary Clinton."" Gray’s Republican opponent, Scott Milne, had asked her about the gap in her voting record, from 2010 to 2016 (she voted in 2008 and then again in 2018).  ""This is not the time to vote shame Vermonters,"" Gray responded. ""I proudly voted for Barack Obama. I proudly voted for Hillary Clinton. And, yes, there was a period in my life where I was not a consistent voter. I was working incredibly hard traveling across the state. And I wasn’t registered where I was living, and there’s no excuse for that so I’m not going to talk about it anymore."" But Gray has previously admitted that she didn’t cast a vote in the 2016 presidential race, in which Clinton had the chance to become the first female president. Instead, the 36-year-old Gray has said Trump’s election opened her eyes to the importance of politics, and helped spark her decision to run for high office. So why did she claim last week that she voted for Clinton in that election? VTDigger emailed Gray’s campaign to find out.  ""To say she did not vote, is true,"" Gray’s campaign manager, Samantha Sheehan, wrote in an email, ""to say she did not attempt to vote is false which is what she clarified last night."" In an interview Friday, Gray said by ""voting"" she meant going through motions of filling out an absentee ballot (she was living in Switzerland and traveling at the time). ""The act of filling in the ballot and sending the ballot, to me, was I attempted to vote for Hillary Clinton."" she said. ""So did I vote? Was my vote counted? No. Could it be counted? No. But did I attempt to vote? Yes."" Gray’s campaign has previously provided VTDigger with an email Gray sent to the town clerk in Newbury, where her parents live on a fruit and vegetable farm, dated November 7, 2016, the day before Trump’s election. In that email, Gray references a previous effort to obtain an absentee ballot, and makes a last-minute effort to vote in any way possible. ""Can you confirm that I can write in the VT candidates (Governor, Lt Gov, AG, etc?)"" Gray wrote to the town clerk. ""I think it is fine if you receive this after tomorrow, and I believe it is actually meant to address situations where an absentee ballot is not received and sent in time. In the alternative, if it is possible to vote via email, I’d like to do that."" But the town clerk apparently informed her it was too late. ""Molly did not receive an absentee ballot,"" Sheehan wrote in an email to VTDigger in July, ""and she didn’t get a federal write-in ballot to the town clerk in Newbury in time."" Sheehan added in a separate email at the time: ""As mentioned by phone, 2016 was an excruciating disappointment and wake-up call for Molly. She wasn’t able to vote, and because of that has made promoting vote-by-mail and information about how to vote a cornerstone of her campaign."" Gray’s voting records show that she voted in Burlington in 2008, and then registered in Newbury in 2017, where she voted in the 2018 midterm election. She also has an active voter registration in Washington, D.C., where she lived for a few years after graduating from college, but has never voted there.  Milne’s campaign on Monday fired the latest shots in a related salvo over voting records, hitting back against spurious claims about his own voting record made by a pro-Gray political action committee. Molly Gray said ""I proudly voted for Hillary Clinton"" during a debate last week. Setting aside some of the related competing claims from the candidates and their allies, it’s clear that Molly Gray did not vote for Hillary Clinton.  Additionally, Gray did not attempt to qualify or add additional context to her claim, likely leaving some viewers with the distinct impression that she did vote for Clinton in 2016.  But public records and Gray’s own statements confirm that she did not. We rate this claim false. ",/factchecks/2020/sep/29/molly-gray/attempted-didnt-vote/

Many of the 2020 presidential candidates released their tax returns on the campaign trail, posting them online for voters to review.  ""By allowing the public to see their taxes, the Democratic candidates are creating a contrast with President Donald Trump, who defied tradition by refusing to disclose his taxes when he ran for president in 2016,"" the New York Times reported in 2019.  Here’s what we know.  According to Biden’s 2017 tax return, he had made payments toward his federal income tax totaling $3,742,974. That’s the number that appears in the Facebook post. But the return says he still owed $1,666, so in all, he was on the hook for a little bit more: $3,744,640. According to Harris’ 2017 tax return — page 280 of 528 in this PDF of her 2004-18 tax returns that her campaign released—  her total federal tax was $516,469, the number that appears in the Facebook post. Including an estimated tax penalty of $2,608, she owed about $519,000 that year.  According to Sanders’ 2017 tax return, he owed $343,882.   According to Warren’s 2017 tax return, the total federal income tax she owed was $268,484. The Facebook post gets Sanders’ and Warren’s federal tax debts correct, and it’s very close on how much Biden and Harris owed in 2017. It also says that Trump paid $750 in federal taxes that year, which the New York Times recently reported.  We haven’t seen Trump’s income tax returns — he’s the only president in modern times to withhold them from the public. A lawyer for the Trump Organization told the New York Times that ""most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate"" in response to a letter the newspaper sent summarizing its findings.  ""Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,"" the lawyer told the paper in a statement. The New York Times noted that this claim appeared to conflate income tax with other federal taxes Trump has paid, including Social Security and Medicare. If evidence emerges to bear that out the claims of Trump’s lawyer, we will reconsider our rating on this fact-check.  For now, we rate this post Mostly True.",/factchecks/2020/sep/28/viral-image/trumps-reported-tax-payments-much-lower-biden-harr/

What Tillis leaves out about Cunningham's butler's pantry
","U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis claims that his Democratic opponent is out of touch with most North Carolinians. And he saved one of his more memorable accusations against Cal Cunningham for his closing statement in the Sept. 14 debate on WRAL. ""Cal criticizes tax breaks for the wealthy, but when Cal was making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, he got a $40,000 tax incentive to update his butler’s pantry,"" Tillis said in his closing statement. (Around the 58-minute mark of this video). ""I didn’t know what a butler’s pantry was because we didn’t have them in the trailer parks I grew up in,"" he said. ""But really, he may have qualified for it but used that. Cal will say anything to get elected."" Republicans have used various forms of this claim to attack Cunningham, citing a story by Real Clear Politics.  Tillis offered a similar line during the Sept. 22 debate on CBS 17, saying: ""When (Cunningham) was making almost $300,000 a year, he got a tax credit from the state of North Carolina, $40,000, to renovate his house including a butler’s pantry,"" he said around the 26-minute mark of this video. The Tillis campaign went a step further in a recent press release, accusing Cunningham of ""abusing"" the tax credit. Meanwhile, the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s video ad claimed that Cunningham got a tax break for not only a butler’s pantry, but also a wet bar. (If these attacks sound familiar, that may be because Tillis’ fellow Republican North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr questioned his opponent’s use of the same tax credits back in 2016.) So what’s the truth about Cunningham’s use of the tax credit and his home renovation? Cunningham did receive a $38,000 tax credit for renovations to his house, which is considered a historic property. A butler’s pantry was one part of several renovations. The ""butler’s pantry"" and ""wet bar"" were two terms used by an inspector to describe the same area in Cunningham’s kitchen. They are not two separate areas. There’s no evidence that Cunningham has done anything illegal.  Additionally, Cunningham says he doesn’t have a butler. According to state law, the owner must spend at least $25,000 on renovations to qualify for a tax credit. The owner must also ""provide a copy of the certification obtained from the State Historic Preservation Officer verifying that the historic structure has been rehabilitated in accordance"" with state law. Cunningham owns a historic home in Raleigh and he applied for the credits in 2014. We reached out to the state’s Historic Preservation Office about Cunningham’s renovations. Officials said they’re not allowed to speak about individual taxpayers.  However, they directed us to state records showing who has received tax credits for historic home restorations. PolitiFact also obtained Cunningham’s application. Records from 2015 show Cunningham spent $129,536 on renovations to his home. Records show he then received $38,860 in tax credits, which were granted to him in installments of $7,772 over the course of five years (as required by law). Cunningham’s application includes notes from an inspector, revealing each part of the house under consideration for renovations. It shows he sought to: Add a roof over the basement doorway Add stained glass windows to bathrooms Replace hardwood floors, Remove walls on the first floor, as well as one in the upstairs bathroom. Relocate a sink, Repair a retaining wall outside, And renovate part of the kitchen. The ""butler’s pantry"" is one of several renovation ideas mentioned in the inspector's notes about the kitchen. ""The kitchen seems to be in two distinct pieces, much (of) which is in what was probably the original kitchen,"" the inspector wrote. ""The secondary cooking area and eating bar are in the space that was probably originally the breakfast room. Several of the appliances are non functional and need replacing."" The inspector said this about Cunningham’s plans to update the kitchen: ""Modifications hope to consolidate the main kitchen elements back into the original space and render the cooking extension into more (of) a wet bar/butler’s pantry area. The stove that does work will replace the cooktop and wall oven in the primary kitchen space. Dishwasher will be replaced with new venting to be determined."" That’s all the application says about the ""butler’s pantry"" area. So what, exactly, is a butler’s pantry? ""A butler’s pantry is pretty common. Basically an extra kitchen prep space,"" Michele Walker, spokeswoman for the state’s Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. Realtor.com, a website created by the National Association of Realtors, wrote in 2019 that a butler’s pantry isn’t as fancy as it sounds.  Historically, the spaces were used ""to store (as well as to count and polish) the family silver, numerous sets of china, and large serving dishes like platters, tureens, and coffee urns."" ""Today, butler's pantries are located just off the kitchen or dining room and are used as staging areas for serving meals, and as a storage space. In a butler's pantry, you'll commonly find a countertop and cabinets for keeping serving pieces, tableware, wine glasses, table linens, candles, and other items for the dining room."" Butler’s pantries were fairly common in middle-class houses from the 1920s, according to Myrick Howard,  president of Preservation North Carolina, a private nonprofit that aims to restore historic properties. ""You wouldn’t call it a butler’s pantry in 2020 because you don’t have a pantry. It’s the same thing you’d probably call a wet bar."" Cunningham doesn’t have a butler, nor has he ever, campaign spokesman Aaron Simpson said. It’s debatable whether this tax credit program is for ""the wealthy."" Of course, people who don’t have enough money to own a house wouldn’t qualify. At the same time, some who qualify might be middle-class. (We won’t even attempt to draw those lines.) However, the Cunningham campaign pointed out that Tillis has praised historic tax credits in the past. Although Tillis didn’t vote, he was speaker in 2011 when the state House voted to extend the tax credit for renovations to historic homes -- along with other tax provisions. When the tax credit was left out of a state budget proposal in 2014, Tillis was speaker of the state House. According to the Winston-Salem Journal, Tillis said the credits had shown a ""well-documented return on investment."" North Carolina offers credits for both residential properties, as well as commercial or what the state calls ""income producing property."" Since the first credits were enacted back in 1998, they’ve promoted more than $3 billion in renovations to commercial and residential properties, Howard said. Another article from 2014, this one in the Wilson Daily Times, quoted Tillis saying the historic tax credit had helped North Carolina. ""That particular program has been a very positive thing for towns. It is a return on investment,"" Tillis is quoted saying in the article. The Cunningham campaign provided a hard copy to PolitiFact. Tillis said Cunningham ""got a $40,000 tax incentive to update his butler’s pantry."" That’s not as far off-base as his campaign’s press release or the NRSC ad, which exaggerate the facts. But they still need clarification. The tax credit was for more than just the butler’s pantry. In Cunningham’s case, the term is used to reference a space in his kitchen -- not a closet used by an employee. Tillis’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Trump misses the mark with claim that Green New Deal proposal wants to ban cows
","In a recent visit to Wisconsin, President Donald Trump offered a series of warnings to voters, but here in the heart of dairy country one in particular stood out. Trump argued that if Joe Biden is elected president, other Democrats would try to jam through the so-called Green New Deal, a proposal aimed at combating climate change and positioning the U.S. for a more environmental-friendly economy. The proposal was introduced by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, and supported by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and others in the Deomcratic presidential primary. Pointedly, Biden did not offer his support for it. In his speech, Trump argued the Green New Deal sought to do a lot of things, including ban air travel (not true) and require a bridge be built to Hawaii (also not true). Then he landed on livestock. ""Cows are out,"" he said in the Sept. 17, 2020 speech. ""Cows, they don’t want cattle, they don’t want cows.""  Does the Democratic-backed Green New Deal really ban cows, a major source of beef and dairy products? No.  Let’s look closer. Since it was unveiled in February 2019, the Green New Deal has been a flashpoint in American politics.  Introduced by Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, the plan calls on the government to reduce the country’s reliance on fossil fuels and curb greenhouse gas emissions throughout the economy, according to a Feb. 21, 2019 report from the New York Times. The goals could be accomplished through making investments in cleaner energy and changing many facets of life, such as how buildings are designed, how people travel and what people eat.  But what about cows?  According to a Feb. 12, 2019 examination of the Green New Deal by PolitiFact National, there is no actual mention of cows in the deal’s text.  The first mention of cows came in additional documents posted and shared by Ocasio-Cortez’s staff around the time of the introduction of the resolution. The line in particular that critics seem to have latched onto states ""we aren’t sure we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes.""  The statement was a part of a fact sheet that Ocasio-Cortez provided to media outlets, according to factcheck.org, and was also a blog post on her website. Those documents -- which were never part of the text of the bill -- have since been taken down, but that hasn’t stopped the president from repeating the claim.  To be sure, cows do play a role in rising global temperatures. Cows produce methane gas as a byproduct of digestion, thanks to their multiple stomachs. That methane is typically released from their body in the form of burps and sometimes flatulence (ie. farting cows).  Those cow emissions add up to 70% of all such emissions from livestock, or about 5.5% of greenhouse gases tied to human activity, according to an Associated Press report. In comparison, emissions from the burning of fossil fuels is roughly 10 to 17 times greater than warming caused by livestock farting and burping, the same report said.  When we asked Trump’s Wisconsin team for backup, they did not respond to the request. The strongest evidence against the claim, though, may be comments from Ocasio-Cortez herself. Shortly after critics took off with the cow claim, Ocasio-Cortez addressed the comments in an appearance on the ""Desus and Mero"" show on Showtime, according to a March 8, 2019, article in the  New York Times headlined, in part, ""No one is taking your hamburgers. But would it even be a good idea?"" That piece quotes Ocasio-Cortez saying: ""It’s not to say you are going to force everybody to go vegan or anything crazy like that. But it’s to say, listen, we’ve got to address factory farming, maybe we shouldn’t be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner.""  Researchers have said, the Times article notes, that reducing the consumption of red meat, such as beef, would be better for peoples’ health and the environment. But, it acknowledges,  agriculture is a hard industry to completely ""decarbonize""  because it’s about keeping people fed. And that would be hard to do without beef.  Or, for Wisconsin purposes, without dairy. Trump claimed that the Green New Deal, proposed by liberal Democrats, among other things aims to ban cows: ""Cows are out … They don’t want cattle, they don’t want cows.""  But the text of the measure  does not mention cows at all, a once-posted supporting document acknowledged it would be hard to ban ""farting cows"" and the main sponsor has explicitly said the proposal is ""not to say you are going to force everybody to go vegan or anything crazy like that.""

Amy Coney Barrett, the Supreme Court and the Affordable Care Act: what the record says
","Democrats have complained loudly about the unfairness of an election-year Supreme Court selection for President Donald Trump when President Barack Obama was denied the same opportunity. But now that Trump has named a candidate, they’re also worried about her positions on the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature health care law.  Joe Biden, Obama’s vice president and now the Democratic presidential nominee, spoke about it in remarks he made on the Supreme Court on Sept. 27.  ""It should come as no surprise that President Trump would nominate Judge Amy Coney Barrett,"" Biden said. ""She has a written track record, disagreeing adamantly with the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the ACA. In fact, she publicly criticized Chief Justice Roberts’ opinion upholding the law eight years ago."" We decided to look into the evidence. We found that Barrett hasn’t written a lot about the Affordable Care Act, but what she has written has been decidedly negative about the Supreme Court’s 2012 ruling upholding its constitutionality.  Her most extensive writing on the Affordable Care Act that we found was a 2017 book review titled, ""Countering the Majoritarian Difficulty."" The book review focused on judicial restraint and when courts should invalidate laws passed by legislatures. Barrett’s writing suggests sympathy with Supreme Court justices who are both ""originalists"" and ""textualists,"" best exemplified by Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, who objected to the majority view that upheld the Affordable Care Act in two cases: the National Federation of Business (NFIB) vs. Sibelius and and the later King vs. Burwell.  Those cases, upheld by Chief Justice John Roberts and the court’s left-leaning justices, found the law constitutional because it ultimately depended on the federal government’s taxing authority to compel people to buy insurance (called the individual mandate). Scalia argued that was wrong because, among other things, the law itself called the tax a penalty. Barrett’s review said that Roberts ""has not proven himself to be a textualist in matters of statutory interpretation."" Her writing also suggested she sided with Scalia: ""To the extent that NFIB v. Sebelius expresses a commitment to judicial restraint by creatively interpreting ostensibly clear statutory text, its approach is at odds with the statutory textualism to which most originalists subscribe. Thus Justice Scalia, criticizing the majority’s construction of the Affordable Care Act in both NFIB v. Sebelius and King v. Burwell, protested that the statute known as Obamacare should be renamed ‘SCOTUScare’ in honor of the court’s willingness to ‘rewrite’ the statute in order to keep it afloat.""  The Washington Post cited an interview with Barrett in 2015 on the radio program ""On Point,"" in which Barrett said of the decision that ""it’s clearly a good result that these millions of Americans won’t lose their tax subsidies,"" but ""the dissent has the better of the legal argument."" (We were unable to find a transcript or recording of the complete interview.) When President Trump nominated her as his selection to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barrett noted her close ties to Scalia and his judicial approach, calling him a mentor with an ""incalculable influence"" on her life and alluding to a textualist approach.  ""His judicial philosophy is mine, too: a judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold,"" she said.   Finally, other liberal groups pointed to a letter Barrett signed along with many Catholic clergy, religious and legal experts that objected to the Obama administration’s policies on birth control and the Affordable Care Act. The letter argued that the administration was infringing on Catholic institutions’ religious liberty by requiring them to accommodate their employees’ access to contraception as part of health insurance.   We reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign, but did not hear back. Biden said that Barrett ""has a written track record, disagreeing adamantly with the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the ACA. In fact, she publicly criticized Chief Justice Roberts’ opinion upholding the law eight years ago."" The track record we found is not very lengthy, and it is more academic than ""adamant."" But it is there, and it strongly suggests Barrett would have sided with Scalia over Roberts in finding the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional.   We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2020/sep/28/joe-biden/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-and-affordable-car/

Fred Upton campaign ad says Jon Hoadley voted to defund the police. That’s not true.
","A television ad from incumbent U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., attacks his Democratic challenger, state Rep. Jon Hoadley, for a vote he cast in June in Michigan’s House. ""Hoadley voted against law enforcement, siding with defund the police, making families less safe,"" the narrator in the ad claims. The ad features Berrien County Sheriff Paul Bailey, who claims that ""what Hoadley did to vote to defund the police was wrong."" But Hoadley didn’t vote to defund the police. Upton’s ad cites Hoadley’s Jun. 17 vote against a resolution adopted by the Michigan House that discourages local governments in Michigan from defunding or abolishing their local police departments. Resolutions offer the Legislature a way to state its priorities, but they are nonbinding. The resolution did not propose to increase or decrease funding for local police departments, whose budgets are determined at the local level. Bailey stands by his claim that Hoadley voted to defund the police. ""It is concerning when Jon Hoadley – who sits on the Appropriations Committee – talks about how frustrating it is that ‘everything but police got cut’ or how important it is to discuss ‘reprioritizing parts of our budget.’ Then, just weeks later, he chooses to vote against a resolution that discourages local governments from defunding or abolishing their police departments,"" Bailey said in a statement to PolitiFact Michigan. Bailey was referring to remarks Hoadley made during a June 12 event organized by Mothers of Hope, a community organization based in Kalamazoo, during which Hoadley was asked about his position on defunding the police. ""It is frustrating that everything but police got cut whenever there was a question — was the pile big enough? So I think it’s important we’re having this conversation now about reprioritizing parts of our budget,"" Hoadley said. ""It's clear to me and in the eyes of law enforcement – his vote was a vote to defund the police,"" Bailey added. Josh Paciorek, communications director for Upton’s campaign, told PolitiFact Michigan in an email: ""We’re taking law enforcement’s view on this one."" The phrase ""defunding the police"" has come to refer to a range of policies, from redirecting some funding toward community development initiatives to dismantling police agencies altogether. It has served as a shorthand rallying cry for activists demanding police reforms, as well as a political cudgel for conservatives seeking to paint liberals as soft on crime. Hoadley said he did not vote to defund the police. ""I voted against an inaccurate resolution that was attempting to score political points, not solve problems,"" he said in a statement to PolitiFact Michigan. ""Many of my colleagues spoke to the need to vote ‘no’ on the resolution and continue the real work on criminal justice reform, racial justice, and properly supporting public safety so both officers and residents are more secure."" The resolution Upton’s ad refers to was introduced by Republican state Rep. Ryan Berman and passed with support of all 58 House Republicans and 21 House Democrats. Hoadley was among the 29 Democratic members of the House who voted against the resolution. Berman explained that he introduced the resolution as a kind of referendum on calls to defund or abolish police departments. ""The notion of outright defunding police departments is dangerous, and I’ve tendered this resolution to take a stand against it,"" said Berman on the House floor. The resolution did not propose increasing funding for local law enforcement departments. While Berman and Hoadley took different positions on the resolution, they agreed on one thing: The COVID-induced economic recession has created fiscal challenges for local governments that could affect police budgets. ""With potentially massive budget shortfalls facing us due to COVID-19, I imagine it will be even tougher for departments financially in the coming years,"" Berman said on the House floor. In a statement explaining his vote, Hoadely agreed with Berman’s assessment but argued that that the resolution’s intent would strip local governments of the flexibility they need to respond to budget shortfalls. ""We cannot opine from the floor of the statehouse on what local communities should or (should) not spend their dollars on while not offering solutions,"" said Hoadley, adding: ""How do you tell your local firefighters that potentially half of you are going to have to get laid off but, that’s OK because this resolution thought that police departments shouldn’t be subject to the same budget realities as everyone else?"" Paciorek, from the Upton campaign, argued that Hoadley’s acknowledgement of the fiscal constraints facing local governments — including police — was inconsistent with his vote. ""Why would he vote against a resolution that discourages local governments from stripping even more resources from police services?"" he asked. Hoadley criticized the resolution as a way of shutting down debate around police reform, but he did not say that funding for police should be reduced. A campaign ad from Upton says Hoadley voted to defund the police. In June, Hoadley voted against a resolution discouraging local governments from reducing their police department’s budgets or abolishing their department. He cited the need to continue discussion about criminal justice reform and to give local governments flexibility to make spending decisions. He did not vote to reduce spending on law enforcement.

Trump spox's absurd claim that Clinton, Obama are responsible for Capt. Humayun Khan's 2004 death
","As Donald Trump attacked the family of a Muslim soldier killed in the Iraq war, his spokeswoman blamed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for Capt. Humayun Khan’s 2004 death. It all began when Khizr Khan, Humayun’s father, seared Trump in an emotional speech at the Democratic National Convention. Trump responded by criticizing Khizr’s wife, Ghazala (who responded in the Washington Post) and crying foul over Khizr’s ""vicious attacks."" This earned him the censure of just about everyone. But all this criticism is misdirected, Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson said Aug. 2 on CNN: ""It was under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost (Khan’s) life."" Given that Khan died five years before Obama became president and Clinton secretary of state, we were perplexed by this statement, so we reached out to Pierson. Pierson told us her point was Clinton voted for the war in Iraq in 2002 and ""decided not to provide support"" and that Obama continued George W. Bush’s rules of engagement policy and ""further restricted engagement in Afghanistan."" Trump (who, in at least one interview, also supported the invasion) had nothing to do with either decision, Pierson said. Pierson reiterated those points in an Aug. 3, interview with CNN. ""Apologize for the timeline. What I was talking about is the fact that Donald Trump has no connection to anything having to do with Capt. Khan, who was a brave war hero. The timeline is very simple and true ... Hillary Clinton voted for the war in Iraq. She did not support the surge. Barack Obama made things worse by invading more countries than President Bush did"" Pierson is well within her rights to critique Clinton’s voting record and Obama’s defense policies. But in her original CNN interview, she went further and said Obama and Clinton changed the rules of engagement that ""probably cost"" Khan’s life. That’s nonsensical. Even if we put the anachronism aside, experts told us restrictive rules of engagement  — military directives that regulate the use of force in armed conflict — were not an issue in Khan’s death. Lt. Col. David G. Bolgiano is a retired military officer who served with Special Operations Forces and the 82nd Airborne Division in Iraq and Afghanistan and currently practices military and security law in Washington. He told us the rules of engagement, which really haven’t changed since the Reagan years, give all troops the right to use deadly force to defend themselves. Though the Obama administration has been criticized for directives that seek to limit civilian deaths, that right still applies today. And that was the case in 2004, when Capt. Khan died in a suicide bombing at age 27. On June 8, 2004, a taxi packed with explosives drove into the gate of his compound in Baqubah, Iraq, while he was inspecting soldiers on guard duty. According to his commanding officer, Khan ordered his man to ""hit the ground"" as he approached the vehicle and motioned for it to stop. The bomb then exploded, killing Khan as well as the two suicide bombers and two Iraqi civilians. ""Capt. Khan had all the authority in the world to use deadly force"" under the rules of engagement, said Bolgiano, who was serving in Iraq in 2004. He added that Khan’s actions were a testament to his bravery and selflessness. ""The officer makes a judgement call,"" said Anthony Cordesman, a national security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has advised General Stanley McChrystal. ""They are very difficult calls to make. But the officer did what a good officer should do, he took the risk and made a command decision."" Khan was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart and Bronze Star. Experts warned that politicization of the rules of engagement were not appropriate and potentially dangerous. ""I can’t think of anything worse than somehow getting into a tactical situation where you’re going to have to deal with concerns in the field over campaign rhetoric,"" Cordesman said. Our ruling Pierson said, ""It was under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost (Capt. Khan’s) life."" First, Pierson’s point about rules of engagement is inaccurate and irrelevant. Under the rules of engagement in 2004 and today, Khan would have been able to use deadly force to defend himself. More importantly, Khan died five years before Obama became president and Clinton his secretary of state.

Gwen Graham says Rick Scott boasts about Florida's low wages
","A Donald Trump presidency would be as bad for America as Gov. Rick Scott has been for Florida, U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham said to delegates at the Democratic National Convention. At a Florida delegation breakfast on July 28, Graham compared the Republican presidential nominee to former businessman Scott, saying they were both from the ""con-man wing"" of the GOP. She said Scott has stunted Florida’s economy by keeping it a low-wage state. ""After six years, we’re now the third most populous state, but we rank 38th in wages,"" said Graham, the daughter of former Florida Gov. Bob Graham. ""Scott's actually proud of how low they are. He goes out around the country and advertises that to other states."" We wondered if Floridians really earned so little, and whether Scott was so proud of low wages that he was using it as a selling point for other states. We found Graham was tripped up by details for both parts of this claim. Low for a reason Let’s start with that number 38. Graham’s office told us was from Census data from the 2011 American Community Survey ranking median household income. The first thing to know about that is the figure is out of date. The latest data from the 2014 survey show Florida has actually regressed to 40th. The second thing to know is that median household income, economists told us, isn’t the same as wages. Wages are a stand-in term for what we’d consider a rate of payment for a unit of time, usually measured in hours.  Income can include things like social security, capital gains, rent, dividends and interest. The Bureau of Labor Statistics records wage estimates based on several different occupations. The state’s median and mean hourly wages for all occupations clocks in at $15.29 and $20.60, respectively, trailing the national median and mean of $17.40 and $23.23. Moody’s senior economist Chris Lafakis used the agency’s Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, and said Florida ranks 30th by that measure. A big reason for that is because Florida’s tourism-based economy is filled with low-skilled jobs that just don’t pay all that well. Meanwhile, the cost of living here is marginally lower than the national average, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Taxes, not wages Scott’s refrain for the past six years has been about creating jobs as the state recovered from recession. One of Scott’s methods has been to try to steal jobs from other states (and not necessarily very high-paying ones). When we reviewed Scott’s statements from these recruiting missions — to places like Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Illinois — we found he did focus quite a bit on the state’s low taxes for businesses. The lack of state income tax also was a major highlight of sales pitches. A Graham spokesman said she was specifically referring to a radio ad that ran in California during Scott’s trip there in May 2016. The commercial attacked California’s recent move to raise the minimum wage to $15, while touting Florida’s growing economy. ""Seven hundred thousand. That’s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage,"" said the ad from Enterprise Florida, the state’s public-private economic development arm chaired by Scott. ""Ready to leave California? Go to Florida instead — no state income tax, and Gov. Scott has cut regulations. Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them."" PolitiFact Florida previously researched whether California stood to lose 700,000 jobs because of the wage increase and rated the statement Mostly False. We learned the figure was a projection of how many jobs California could have added by 2026 if it didn’t increase the minimum wage, not a decline in net employment. Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz said the ad wasn’t Scott bragging about low wages, but rather him pointing out differences between the states’ economies. ""He has never said he is proud of how low our wages are,"" Schutz said. It’s possible to argue Scott’s comparison is inferring Florida is benefitting precisely because it’s not raising wages like California. He has certainly been accused of talking up Florida’s low wages, even though he doesn’t explicitly say it. ""By raising the minimum wage in California, 700,000 people are going to lose their jobs, there are a lot of opportunities for companies to prosper in Florida and compete here and that’s what I’m going after,"" Scott told the Los Angeles Times in May. But that strikes us more as saying California is going too high, not necessarily talking up that Florida is staying too low. Keep in mind that Florida’s minimum wage of $8.05 per hour is already higher than the federally mandated $7.25 an hour, and is pegged to inflation by law. Experts told us companies weigh many factors when deciding whether to relocate. Businesses usually are more concerned with how well a labor pool will perform for the compensation they receive. ""That doesn’t mean ‘cheap’ workers, but workers that represent a good value (how productive workers are relative to the cost of hiring workers),"" Rollins College economics professor Bill Seyfried said in an email. Florida also is not the only state faced with lackluster wage growth. Tina Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University, said trying to increase purchasing power is a global problem. She cited an Indeed Hiring Lab report that said real wage growth is lagging overall. ""Only 16 percent of jobs today are both high-paying and saw wage growth at least matching inflation over the past 10 years,"" she said. Our ruling Graham said, ""We rank 38th in wages. ... (Rick Scott) goes out around the country and advertises that to other states."" There are issues with the figure she used, which is both outdated and an improper reading of how wages are calculated. But while there’s no question Florida’s wages are low by national standards, it doesn’t appear Scott has boasted (at least publicly) about this fact while recruiting businesses from other states. The closest example is Enterprise Florida’s California radio ad, which focused on the Golden State’s lower jobs forecast after boosting the minimum wage. While clearly opposing the $15 minimum wage, the ad focused on lower taxes and less regulation, not Florida’s minimum wage. We rate Graham’s statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e3466756-1fd9-4fa7-8d70-4ed10bc7f1c8",/factchecks/2016/aug/03/gwen-graham/gwen-graham-says-rick-scott-boasts-about-floridas-/

Do trade deals threaten India as low-cost HIV drug maker?
","If there was one success story to emerge from the International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa, it was that more people are getting treated for HIV/AIDS than ever before -- about 17 million by the latest United Nations estimate. Falling drug prices played a key role in helping providers reach this point. But the international health group Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières) warned at a press conference that trade negotiations around the world put future gains at risk. The group said its latest report ""examines multiple global threats to access to affordable treatment, including trade deals which threaten India’s role as the ‘pharmacy of the developing world.’"" Trade is at the center of the U.S. presidential election for its effect on the American work force. But is there more at play? We wondered if it’s true that the next round of agreements, both those that involve the United States and those that don’t, would undermine some large drug makers in India. Why India India matters because thanks to the country’s patent laws, India and generics go together like toast and jam. The rules there make it easier than other places for companies to churn out generic drugs once the patent on the original version runs out. Generics are cheaper than their brand name cousins and if you want to stretch a dollar, you take the generic option. Doctors Without Borders said 97 percent of the drugs it uses to treat people with HIV are generics made in India. That includes medicines for HIV itself, as well as for diseases like pneumonia and tuberculosis that hit people with suppressed immune systems. Doctors Without Borders is worried less about the drugs it uses today and more about the ones it’s counting on in the future. As the number of people coming in for treatment rises, doctors are finding more who don’t respond to the most common, or first-line, medications. Doctors Without Borders is focused on making second-and-third-line drugs more affordable to keep pace with a growing need, and they see India as the place to make that happen. Impact of trade deals Although the Trans-Pacific Partnership gets a lot of attention in the United States, India is not part of it. But it is part of discussions involving the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a mega-regional pact that aims to tie together 16 countries including China, India, Australia, Japan, South Korea and many other Asian nations. The European Union is also seeking a regional trade agreement with India and other Asian countries. Both of those trade negotiations have sought to get India to tighten its patent laws. The United States has too, through a one-on-one process overseen by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The issues that office has raised mirror ones in the big trade deals. The USTR’s latest report criticizes India’s patent laws, saying ""the pharmaceutical industry in particular faces a host of challenges related to intellectual property rights."" What do U.S. trade negotiators not like in particular? For one, India is reluctant to grant new patents for a drug or blend of drugs built around medications that already enjoy patent protection. These so-called secondary patents extend the time for the drug maker to enjoy exclusive production rights. That translates into a chance to charge higher prices. American officials also don’t care for India’s rules on clinical trial information. When someone invents a drug, they have to prove it’s safe and effective. That proof is in the trial reports. India lets generic drug makers rely on the original clinical trials. One way to extend the exclusive right to make a drug is to bar generic drug makers from using that data for a number of years. Would these sorts of changes make life easier for the makers of new drugs and harder for the generic manufacturers? We found no dispute that they would. We talked with independent experts who think India should stand its ground and those who thought it ought to bend, but either way, they agreed on who wins and who loses. There are good arguments on both sides for protecting the profits of companies that invent new drugs, versus making drugs more affordable. We take no position on the larger question of where the right balance point falls.  We're focused only on the claim that large trading partners want to move Indian law in favor of the inventors of new drugs. Lee Branstetter is a professor and trade specialist at Carnegie Mellon University. He thinks Indian law ought to change at the expense of the generic companies. ""In the short run, this will constrain the profit opportunities for the generic producers,"" he told us. Srividhya  Ragavan, a professor of law at Texas A&M, thinks India’s laws strike the right balance as they are. She told us she sees the U.S. position as ""an effort to weaken India’s generic drug industry."" We found any number of articles that reached the same conclusion. But just because Branstetter and Ragavan see eye to eye on how these policy shifts would undermine generic drug makers, that doesn't mean they agree on what this means for the availability of low-cost drugs. Ragavan told us ""the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and EU’s trade negotiations, are all targeting India’s generic drug industry much to the detriment of access to medication to the poor people."" Branstetter said that’s unlikely and highlights an important feature in the overarching trade rules of the World Trade Organization. The escape hatch Branstetter said based on what he’s seen in other countries (he cited Peru as an example) he doubts that would happen. But even if it did, he said, a part of the WTO code -- the Doha Declaration on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement -- gives countries the chance to override a patent that limits a drug’s availability. Branstetter calls it an escape hatch. ""Any member state could declare we have a public health emergency,"" Branstetter said. ""Then, they can force the company that holds the patent to licence the manufacture of that drug to a domestic or foreign drug producer, who would provide it at an agreed price."" Branstetter notes that the Trans-Pacific Partnership specifically requires any country that signs it to accept that Doha declaration. Countries have taken this step before. At the height of the AIDS crisis in the mid 2000s, Indonesia, Malaysia, Ghana, Mozambique and many others issued what are called compulsory licenses to get affordable HIV/AIDS drugs to their citizens. Still, Rohit Malpani, director of policy of the Doctors Without Borders- Access Campaign, told us that in recent years, the number of compulsory licenses has fallen off. ""Even if countries have the right to use the safeguard and can use them they do not,"" Malpani said. He suggested several reasons, including a lack of political will and pressure from the United States, the EU and the drug companies. Our ruling Doctors Without Borders said that trade deals threaten the capacity of Indian generic drug makers to produce the next round of HIV drugs. We found that trade negotiations, whether part of large regional trade agreements or unilateral discussions between the United States and India, have language that work against India generic drug makers. They push India to be more ready to grant patents for drugs that are extensions of  drugs that already enjoy patent protection. And they want India to bar generic drug makers from relying on the clinical trial data produced by the inventor of the drug. Both measures would make patents last longer and give the drug companies more time to charge higher prices. None of the articles we read or experts we reached doubted this result or that this would undermine the generic drug makers. Our experts disagreed on whether this would reduce access to critical drugs. The trade deals do no favors for India’s generic drug makers. With a caveat about future access to drugs, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/aug/03/doctors-without-borders/do-trade-deals-threaten-india-low-cost-hiv-drug-ma/

Sheriff David Clarke says 'it's a lie' that black males twice as likely as white to be shot by cops
","On July 17, 2016, the day six officers were shot in Baton Rouge, La., Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. engaged in a testy interview about police shootings and race relations. About 2 minutes in, as the Fox News insider sat side-by-side with CNN anchor Don Lemon at the site of the Republican National Convention, Lemon abruptly went to a commercial as he and Clarke talked over each other. Clarke, a conservative who runs as a Democrat, was in Cleveland as a prime-time speaker at the GOP’s convention the following day. In the interview, Clarke made a claim about President Barack Obama and the police shooting of civilians during this exchange: Clarke: There is no data -- and you know this -- there is no data, there is no research that proves any of that nonsense. None. Even -- Lemon: You’d have to be more specific about what data and what nonsense you’re talking about. Clarke: That law enforcement officers treat black males different than white males in policing in these urban areas. Lemon: There is data that supports that. Clarke: There is not data. Lemon: The president spoke about it. Cedric Alexander, who’s a law enforcement officer -- Clarke: The president has been lying about it. He said it again the other day, when he said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males. Don, that is a lie. Lemon: That is not a lie. So, Clarke makes a two-part claim: 1. That Obama said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males. Is that what Obama said? 2. That the figure Obama cited is ""a lie"" because ""there is no data"" to back it up. In other words, are black males twice as likely as white males to be shot by police? In paraphrasing the president and calling a statistic a lie, even while saying there is no relevant data, Clarke makes a claim that’s on an important topic but in a somewhat muddled way. Let’s try to sort it out. What Obama said Clarke didn’t provide us any evidence that Obama said what he said he did. But the White House provided us, and PolitiFact National has annotated, what the president said July 7, 2016 in Warsaw, Poland. Obama spoke days after the fatal police shootings of two African-American men -- Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile, in Falcon Heights, Minn. One statistic the president recited was: ""Last year, African-Americans were shot by police at more than twice the rate of whites."" So, Clarke was slightly off in his paraphrasing. Obama’s reference was to all African-Americans, not just African-American males. The statistic Now to the second part of Clarke’s claim -- whether it’s ""a lie"" because ""there is no data"" that black males are two times more likely than white males to be shot by a law enforcement officer. This is where Clarke goes more astray. The sheriff told us through a spokeswoman to ""read Heather Mac Donald's book, War on Cops. It's chock full of data that supports my position."" Mac Donald, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research in New York, told us she didn’t have any statistics on whether black males are more likely to be shot by police. Mac Donald did emphasize that how often black males are shot by police should be considered not in terms of what percentage black males are of the total population, but their rates of violent crime, since being involved in violent crime increases the likelihood of being shot by police. That view has been advanced by some criminologists. And the Washington Post, in its reporting on fatal shootings by police, has noted that a disproportionate number of murders and other violent crimes are committed by black Americans. The Post, which won a 2016 Pulitzer Prize for its work on fatal shootings by police, reported in July 2016 that, taking into account population, black Americans are 2.5 times as likely as white Americans to be shot and killed by police officers. (And The Guardian, which tracks people killed by police by shootings or any means, reported that in 2015, black people were killed by police at twice the rate of white, Hispanic and native Americans. ) But, again, those figures are for fatal police shootings. When it comes to the likelihood, by race and gender, of being shot by police, University Louisville criminology and criminal justice professor Justin Nix told us: ""We just don’t have the data to make a statement like that."" Nix and four other criminology and criminal justice professors told us there simply are no national figures on all police shootings. Said Samuel Walker at the University of Nebraska at Omaha: ""I’m cautiously optimistic,"" given the attention being paid to police shootings, ""that the FBI will begin collecting the data."" Our rating Clarke made essentially a two-part claim. He said that Obama ""said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males,"" but he was slightly off, in that the president spoke about all African-Americans and whites, not just males. Clarke also said the two times more likely statistic is ""a lie"" because ""there is no data."" He is correct that there is no national data on all police shootings -- fatal and non-fatal -- to back that statistic. But he goes too far in saying it is a lie, given that we don’t know if the statistic is accurate. For a statement that contains some element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/aug/03/david-clarke-jr/sheriff-david-clarke-says-its-lie-black-males-twic/

Donald Trump correctly claims homeownership is at a 51-year low
","Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has often used economic statistics to attack President Barack Obama’s administration, and he did the same following the Democratic National Convention. ""American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62.9% - lowest rate in 51yrs,"" Trump tweeted July 30, 2016. ""WE will bring back the 'American Dream!"" We haven’t fact-checked Trump on this particular statistic before, so we took a look at the data. On the numbers The ""homeownership rate"" is defined as the proportion of occupied households actually owned by those living there. A Census Bureau report released last week contains Trump’s 62.9 percent figure, referring to the non-seasonally-adjusted homeownership rate. Trump’s tweet referred to Federal Reserve Economic Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. His math checks out — the homeownership rate (again not seasonally adjusted) was last this low in 1965, 51 years ago. As the graph shows, the rate grew steadily since 1995, reaching a 69 percent peak in 2005. But it has been in decline ever since.  Other studies paint a similar picture, such as one finding the share of first-time home buyers in 2015 was 32 percent, the lowest since 1987. So Trump’s data is accurate, but there are some caveats. Demographic trends Experts told us millennials are largely to blame for the dropping homeownership rate, but it’s as much their lifestyle preferences as it is a sign of a poor economy. Many millennials graduated college at the onset of the 2008 recession, meaning more people chose to live with their parents, said Adam DeSanctis, economic issues media manager at the National Association of Realtors. One survey identified rising student and credit card debt, as well as difficulties saving for down payments, as key deterrents. At the same time, lifestyle choices — such as marrying later in life, going to college and having fewer children — all contribute to lower levels of homeownership, DeSanctis said. Jed Kolko, an independent housing economist, argues that lifestyle shifts, not financial variables, are primarily responsible for more youth living with their parents. Many millennials have expressed little desire to own a home, said Byron Studdard, a financial adviser at Studdard Financial, which focuses on estate and retirement planning. Witnessing the financial crisis and their parents’ difficulties paying off their mortgages, as well as general desire to be mobile, serve as deterrents. Studdard also cautioned against comparisons to 1965, because that was a different generation that was more likely than millennials to view homeownership as the first step to prosperity. ""I’m not sure the homeownership rate is necessarily going to be a good indicator of if America is great again, like it was when we had the World War II generation,"" Studdard explained. How big a problem is it? While the falling homeownership rate is not a positive, economists we spoke to disagreed on how problematic it was. In a New York Times article, Kolko wrote that the homeownership rate is misleading because it fails to capture renters. He said the ""headship rate"" — the percent of adults heading a household — is a better figure that captures both owners and renters. Increases in the headship rate still stimulates household construction, he said. That rate, according to the Census Bureau’s 2015 Current Population Survey, has been going up as of 2013. Slight decreases in owner-occupied households were outpaced by increases in renter households, said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at Trulia, a company providing real estate information for buyers and sellers. Yet renter-households still boost demand for construction and other goods, he said. The comparative benefits of renting versus owning a home are still disputed, said Aaron Terrazas, a senior economist at Zillow, an online real estate database company. On the other hand, DeSanctis said the low homeownership rate poses problems for the American economy. Owning a home has typically been a major source of investment for the middle class, and renting does not fulfill the same investment function. ""As a result, the country has become more unequal in recent years as rising home values have benefitted current homeowners greatly at a time more people are renting and facing escalating rental prices each year,"" he said. He said Trump has a point in identifying the troubles people have buying a home, especially as rising rental rates and housing prices surpass income gains. The biggest housing losses immediately after the recession affected middle-aged adults, Terrazas said. Our ruling Trump said homeownership is at its lowest since 1965. The numbers back him up. However, there are some caveats. Some of the decline is due to lifestyle, and not economic, changes. In addition, experts told us the housing market is not in as dire straits as one statistic suggests. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/aug/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-correctly-claims-homeownership-51-yea/

Joe Biden wrong to say Donald Trump has called for carpet bombing
","The morning before he was scheduled to speak at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden made an appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe program, where the topic quickly turned to foreign policy and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. ""Some of the things he says, like for example, I know he's trying to be tough but he's going to go out and carpet bomb,"" said Biden. ""You want to make friends and influence people in the Middle East? So you're going to go carpet bomb innocent people and bad people at the same time, and that's going to help us fight against ISIS and Daesh?"" Biden said. ""I mean, the things he says are — are — are — make absolutely no sense."" Carpet bombing is the strategy where the military indiscriminately bombs everything within a predetermined area regardless of whether civilians are present. A few hours later, at a news conference, Trump said Biden had lied about his position. ""I never said I wanted to carpet bomb,"" Trump responded. ""That was Ted Cruz."" Who's correct here? We contacted a Biden spokeswoman but didn't receive a reply. So we searched the transcripts of major interview shows and Trump rallies and could find no instance where Trump called for carpet bombing. Instead, the Republican has repeatedly said he would ""bomb the hell out of ISIS,"" with no reference to carpet bombing or any comparable tactic. Some examples: He's said he would ""bomb the hell out of them"" to destroy ISIS's oil-producing capacity, then send in United States oil companies to take that oil because ""there is no Iraq"" (Fox News, June 16, 2015);  ""I'd bomb the hell out of the oil fields. I'd then get Exxon, I'd then get these great oil companies to go in. They would rebuild them so fast your head will spin"" (CNN, July 8, 2015). And this July 8, 2015, exchange with NBC's Katy Tur: Trump: ""With ISIS, you kill them at the head. You take the oil. That’s where they’re getting their money. If you bomb the hell out of it, you bomb the hell out of it. You’ve got to stop their wealth. They have tremendous wealth."" Tur: ""What about civilians?"" Trump: ""I'm talking about oil. I’m talking about oil areas. I'm not talking about civilian areas."" Tur: ""Civilians are near oil areas."" Trump: ""Oh, give me a break, Katy. Go ahead. Next question."" Trump is also correct that Cruz was the candidate who called for carpet bombing. The Texas senator proposed the strategy in a Dec. 5, 2015, speech, promising that ""we will utterly destroy ISIS. We will carpet bomb them into oblivion. I don't know if sand can glow in the dark, but we're going to find out."" Cruz repeated it several times throughout the campaign but tried to redefine carpet bombing by saying he did not want civilians to be targeted. (PolitiFact concluded in December 2015 that Cruz's definition, saying that only enemy soldiers would be bombed, was essentially the opposite of carpet bombing.) So Trump was right and Biden was wrong. We should also note that Biden isn't the only Clinton enthusiast to level that accusation against Trump. Four days later, on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos, retired Marine Corps General John Allen, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan, made a similar claim. Allen, who spoke at the Democratic convention, has endorsed Clinton. ""What we do have to do, George, is listen to what (Trump) has been saying about our military,"" Allen said. ""He's called it a disaster. He says our military can't win anymore. That's a direct insult to every single man and woman who's wearing the uniform today. He's talked about needing to torture. He's talked about needing to murder the families of alleged terrorists. He's talked about carpet-bombing ISIL."" ""Who do you think is going to (be) carpet-bombed when all that occurs?"" Allen said. ""It's going to be innocent families."" Our ruling Biden said that Donald Trump ""is going to go out and carpet bomb."" Trump has made it clear that he's not going to be reluctant to bomb ISIS, but the candidate has not, as far as we could find, called for a practice that includes bombing civilians, which is what carpet bombing can entail. It was another GOP candidate, Ted Cruz, who called for carpet bombing. We rate Biden's claim as False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f4590925-b207-4146-81aa-f6940c99f7c6",/factchecks/2016/aug/02/joe-biden/joe-biden-wrong-say-donald-trump-has-called-carpet/

Attacking Pat Toomey: Did he try to shut down government over Planned Parenthood?
","The latest ad from the PAC Majority Forward goes after Pat Toomey’s stances on abortion. It accuses the senator of voting against Planned Parenthood, being against a woman’s right to choose and supporting the overturning of Roe v. Wade. In one segment, Majority Forward, which bills itself as an organization with a goal of increasing voter registration and turnout and is associated with the pro-Democrat Senate Majority PAC, claims Toomey ""even tried to shut down the federal government in order to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood."" Planned Parenthood was a major point of contention last year, and Toomey has long been an opponent of the organization. But did Toomey really try to shut down the federal government? The dispute over Planned Parenthood peaked last September after a series of undercover videos of its executives and technicians discussing aborted fetuses had been released by the Center for Medical Progress. House and Senate Republicans, primarily Tea Party figures, responded by calling for Congress to defund the organization. The debate caused complications as legislators worked toward a spending deal needed to keep many government programs running.   Planned Parenthood gets about $450 million each year in federal funds, mostly out of funding from Medicare and Medicaid. On September 24, the Senate voted on a spending bill containing language to defund Planned Parenthood. Toomey was one of 47 senators who voted in favor of the bill -- not enough for it to pass. On September 30, the day before the deadline for the government shutdown, the Senate passed a spending deal that didn’t contain language to defund Planned Parenthood. Toomey was one of 20 senators to vote no on the final bill, compared to 78 senators who voted yes. This came about a week after Toomey told New York magazine he didn’t think it was a good idea to cause a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood.   A government shutdown was a possible result if the bill did not pass. ""He voted against the continuing resolution that funded Planned Parenthood and the government,"" said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown’s Government Affairs Institute. ""Whether he was threatening to shut down the government may be rhetorical.""    Last year, after Toomey voted against the spending plan, he released a statement saying, ""I have strongly supported efforts to permanently stop government shutdowns. Shutdowns are no way to conduct the nation’s business....It is now apparent that the government will not shut down, so the question before the Senate is whether taxpayers should be forced to fund Planned Parenthood’s outrageous extremist practices. I voted against that, and I am instead in favor of shifting Planned Parenthood’s funding over to health centers that provide essential services to women in need.""   Toomey’s campaign condemned the Majority Forward ad, saying the PAC was lying and said Toomey has fought to end government shutdowns. Majority Forward did not respond to a request for comment.    Our ruling  With Republicans calling to defund Planned Parenthood last year, a federal spending plan was pushed to the brink. Had a plan not passed before Oct. 1, the government would have shut down like it did in 2013. On September 30, a few days after voting for a failed spending bill that would have defunded Planned Parenthood, Senator Pat Toomey voted no on a final spending bill overwhelmingly approved by the Senate. So Toomey voted against a bill that averted a government shutdown. By doing so, he didn’t do the same thing as try to ""shut down the government,"" as Majority Forward claims.

Dave Brat: Education Committee 'is deciding what's going to be in your local salad bar'
","Uncle Sam’s overreach is so great that his fingers are in your local salad bar, according to U.S. Rep. Dave Brat, R-7th. During a podcast interview on TheBlaze, a news network founded by conservative commentator Glenn Beck, Brat said Washington should cede control over many of its programs to state and local governments. And he called for the crumbling of some federal pillars. ""The Department of Education for starters, right?"" Brat said on June 29. ""A few weeks ago, (the) education committee in Congress is deciding what’s going to be in your local salad bar. For real. You can’t make it up."" Our thoughts went to the salad bars at local groceries and restaurants, and we wondered whether the education panel really is deciding their contents. Lettuce tell you what we found. For starters, Brat’s statement was overly broad. Barbara Boland, the congressman’s press secretary, said Brat was referring to salad bars in schools. Boland pointed us to a reauthorization bill, called the ""Improving Child Nutrition Education Act of 2016,"" which would put new restrictions on a federal program that offers free breakfasts and lunches to low-income students. The measure was approved by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, by a 20-14 vote, on May 18. Under the Republican-sponsored bill, schools would qualify for free meals for all of their students if 60 percent of their students come from low-income homes. The current threshold for school-wide free meals is 40 percent. The bill also adds momentum to Republican efforts to give states control over free-meals programs. It would start a pilot program in which three states would be given block grants to pay for food and would be freed from some federal nutritional mandates on the meals. The nutritional standards have been a big deal since 2010, when Congress - at the urging of first lady Michelle Obama - required free-meal schools to serve healthier food. Subsequent regulations by the U.S. Department of Agriculture established minimum weekly requirements for servings of meats, vegetables, fruits, grains and milk. They also established minimum and maximum calorie standards for each breakfast and lunch. Many Republicans, including Brat, say the standards are burdensome on schools and have resulted in hungry students being served unappetizing meals that barely are eaten.   What about salad bars? Many schools have found that salad bars are popular with students and a good way to satisfy vegetable requirements for children who receive free meals. Federal regulations encourage their use. But only one sentence in the 180-page House bill addresses salad bars. It instructs the USDA to create regulations that would give free-meal schools ""flexibility"" in setting up and running salad bars. That’s contrary to Brat’s claim that the education committee was ""deciding"" what’s going to be in any salad bar - school or otherwise. Salad bars came up for only two minutes during a five-hour debate the committee held on the bill on May 18. That occurred when Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., withdrew an amendment that would have required the USDA to draw up a plan to expand the use of salad bars in free-meal schools and offer one-time federal grants to pay for their purchase and installation. ""There is nothing in the House bill that regulates what schools can serve in their salad bars,"" we were told by Lorelei Disorga, vice president for the United Fresh Produce Association, a lobbying organization that monitors school lunch legislation. We received a similar statement from Tyler Hernandez, deputy communications director of the House Education and Workforce Committee. ""HR 5003 does not dictate what must be served on salad bars,"" he wrote in an email, referring to the bill by its congressional number. But there’s one more thing consider. Brat’s office makes a point we noted earlier: This year’s legislation largely reauthorizes the 2010 free-meals bill that instructed the USDA to devise regulations for healthy breakfasts and lunches. The regulations, enacted in 2012, include weekly standards for the amount of vegetables served: 3.75 cups for grades K-8; 5 cups for grades 9-12. Within those rules are a subset of minimum requirements for the types of vegetables served, identified as ""dark green,"" ""red-orange"" and ""beans and peas."" The USDA, in a 2013 memo, said it has received ""numerous inquiries"" on how free-meal schools with salad bars can make sure they’re complying with the vegetable regulations. The department recommended prepackaging salads with the proper mix, posting instructional signs by salad bar, or stationing staff at the end of the salad bar to ensure each student leaves with a federally reimbursable meal. We finally should note that Republicans on the education committee voted 20-1 to pass this year’s reauthorization bill. Brat was the lone GOP dissenter. In a May 19 news release, Brat said the healthy-meal regulations have resulted in students being served ""stomach-churning school lunches."" Boland, Brat’s press secretary, also told us in an email that the congressman is concerned by the rising cost of the free breakfast and lunch programs. The price is about $16.5 billion this year and is expected to reach $31 billion in 2025, according to projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Boland said Brat thinks the programs would be run more efficiently by states. Our ruling    Brat said, ""A few weeks ago, (the) education committee in Congress is deciding what’s going to be in your local salad bar."" The congressman misspoke. The committee never has considered what should be in the salad bars of, say, restaurants or grocery stores. Brat’s office said the congressman was referring to school salad bars. Brat points to the committee’s May passage of a bill providing free breakfasts and lunches for students from low-income homes. The measure does not specify what vegetables should be served, and the panel spent no time haggling over amounts of lettuce, carrots and tomatoes. Setting nutritional standards would be left to the USDA. The bill largely would reauthorize free-meals legislation passed in 2010 that prioritized serving healthy food to students. In the aftermath, the USDA established copious regulations that include minimum weekly servings of green and red-orange vegetables and legumes. Many schools have salad bars, and it can be argued that Congress has allowed the USDA to regulate their contents. But it’s hard to imagine any salad bar worth its salt not offering a mixture of vegetables.  So Brat’s statement that the education committee is deciding salad bar contents - in schools or, perhaps, anywhere - is a stretch, and we rate it False.",/factchecks/2016/aug/02/dave-brat/dave-brat-education-committee-deciding-whats-going/

Wrong: Fox News anchor says networks covered Khizr Khan but skipped Patricia Smith
","On Fox and Friends the week after the Democratic National Convention, Brian Kilmeade criticized a ""double standard"" in the media. He accused major media networks of covering Khizr Khan’s remarks — accusing Republican nominee Donald Trump of not reading the Constitution — live, but not covering Patricia Smith, the mother of Benghazi victim Sean Smith, live. ""Nobody covered those (Patricia Smith’s) remarks live but almost everybody covered Khan's, Mr. Khan's remarks live,"" Kilmeade said. That’s wrong. We looked through television programming from both events using a recording service that chronicles and time-stamps live television programming. Here’s what we found. What aired Smith’s speech, on the first night of the Republican National Convention July 18, 2016, began around 8:24 p.m. ET. The speech was aired live by both CNN and MSNBC. It was not live on Fox News, coincidentally. Fox News went to commercial right before Smith took the stage and returned to a phone interview between Donald Trump and Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly. Lou Dobbs Tonight on the Fox Business channel had footage of the speech, but no audio. The broadcast networks, NBC, CBS, ABC and FOX, did not cover any convention programming before 10 p.m. ET. Khan’s speech aired at 9:13 p.m. ET on July 28, 2016, from Philadelphia. Again, it was aired live by CNN and MSNBC but not Fox News. Fox News was in a commercial when Khan began speaking. The cable network showed pictures of Khan speaking on the side but did not have audio. When Fox News returned from the break, it went to a press conference on ISIS by FBI director James Comey. C-SPAN also covered both speeches live. A Fox News spokeswoman did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling Kilmeade said ""nobody"" aired Patricia Smith’s remarks live, but ""almost everybody"" covered Khan’s remarks live. CNN, MSNBC and C-SPAN covered both speeches live. Coincidentally, Fox News — of which Kilmeade is an employee — covered neither live. Point being: the speeches were covered the same.

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that Clinton, Democrats rigged debate dates to conflict with NFL
","Did Democrats rig the presidential debate schedule so the highly anticipated faceoffs would run opposite major sporting events? Donald Trump seems to think so. ""As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games,"" he wrote in a July 29, 2016, tweet. ""Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!"" He was referring to the the first two debates --  Sept. 26, when the Atlanta Falcons are set to play the New Orleans Saints on Monday Night Football, and Oct. 9, when the New York Giants are scheduled to play the Green Bay Packers on Sunday Night Football. Trump’s tweet underscores one of Trump’s recurring campaign themes -- that Hillary Clinton is ""crooked,"" including playing with a stacked deck against her primary challenger, Bernie Sanders. Hard evidence to support the allegation of bad faith by the Democratic National Committee against Sanders in scheduling the primary debates is elusive, as we’ve noted. But what about the fall’s debate schedule, which includes three presidential and one vice presidential debate between Sept. 26 and Oct. 19? The short answer is that Trump is wrong: The national parties have no role in setting the dates for the general-election debates. They were actually determined by an independent, bipartisan organization, well in advance of when the parties’ nominees became clear this year. (Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to an inquiry.) The debate-setting process Unlike primary debates, which are set by the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee in collaboration with media outlets, the four general-election debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. While presidential debates were held in 1960, 1976, 1980 and 1984, the current system emerged in 1987 with the creation of the commission. At the time, it was co-chaired by two party leaders, Democrat Paul Kirk and Republican Frank Fahrenkopf. Those two men left their party positions in 1989, and since then the commission has included both Democrats and Republicans, along with journalists and other prominent figures, while staying away from people holding the parties’ official leadership positions. Fahrenkopf remains a co-chair, with Mike McCurry, a spokesman for then-President Bill Clinton, co-chairing for the Democrats. Democrats on the commission include former Rep. Jane Harman of California, while the Republicans include former Sens. John Danforth of Missouri and Olympia Snowe of Maine and former Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana. The commission works hard to avoid any suggestion of bias, said Alan Schroeder, a Northeastern University journalism professor and author of Presidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail. ""The way to depoliticize is to do everything early -- the candidate-inclusion criteria, the dates and locations, the formats, "" Schroeder said. In the case of the 2016 general election debates, Schroeder said in January 2015 the commission solicited bids from universities willing to host a debate, and announced the 16 applicants in April 2015. Most importantly for evaluating Trump’s tweet, the commission announced the dates and locations on Sept. 23, 2015. That’s almost 14 months before Election Day. Back then, the Republican field had 17 candidates and there was widespread skepticism that Trump could win the nomination. Clinton, for her part, was the frontrunner but facing a spirited challenge from Sanders. Equally important, the NFL schedule wasn’t set until April 14, 2016 -- about seven months after the commission announced the debate dates. It shouldn’t be a surprise that there would be a game on a Sunday or a Monday night -- the NFL has been playing football on Monday nights since 1970 and on Sunday nights since 1987. But it’s something of a game of triage when trying to avoid sporting events at that time of year. Besides professional football, debate planners typically have to contend with playoff baseball and Saturday college football. ""In choosing the dates, the commission sits down with a calendar to look at network programming -- the Olympics, playoff games, religious holidays,"" Schroeder said. ""It’s never a clear calendar -- there are always conflicts of some kind or another. So they pick the best days possible and days that would generate most viewership."" The debate commission echoed this theme when it responded to Trump’s tweet with this statement: ""The Commission on Presidential Debates started working more than 18 months ago to identify religious and federal holidays, baseball league playoff games, NFL games, and other events in order to select the best nights for the 2016 debates. It is impossible to avoid all sporting events, and there have been nights on which debates and games occurred in most election cycles. A debate has never been rescheduled as a result. ""As a point of reference, in a four-year period, there are four general election debates (three presidential and one vice presidential) and approximately 1,000 NFL games. ""The CPD selects the debate dates a year in advance in order for the television networks to have maximum lead time and predictability in scheduling these extremely important civic education forums. The CPD believes the dates for the 2016 debates will service the American public well."" In 2012, the final presidential debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama was scheduled on a Monday night that happened to be opposite a professional football game between the Detroit Lions and the Chicago Bears, and Game 7 of the National League Championship Series between the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals. And of course, for Americans torn between football and politics, there are more options today than ever, including DVR and online streaming. Put it all together, Schroeder said, and the ""idea of anyone gaming that process is really inconceivable."" Our ruling Trump said that Clinton and her party ""are trying to rig the debates"" so that NFL games drain away viewers. However, neither Clinton nor her party were involved in setting up the dates for the general-election debates, as they were during the primary debates. Instead, that task falls to a bipartisan commission that has no connection to either the campaigns or the parties. In fact, the debate dates were chosen seven months before the NFL schedule was even released, making scheduling conflicts almost unavoidable -- not the work of one campaign or party.

Hillary Clinton's wrong claim that FBI director Comey called her comments about email 'truthful'
","Hillary Clinton said that she has told the public a consistent and truthful story about classified material on her emails, and FBI director James Comey backed her up. That immediately caught our attention. On the July 31 edition of Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace played a video montage of several times Clinton said something like: ""I am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time."" Wallace remarked, ""After a long investigation, FBI director James Comey said none of those things that you told the American public were true."" That’s not what Clinton heard Comey say, she responded. ""Director Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails,"" she said. Clinton appears to have selective hearing. In saying Comey called her answers ""truthful,"" Clinton was apparently referring to — and putting a positive spin on — a comment Comey made in a July 7 congressional hearing regarding Clinton’s closed-door interview with the FBI as part of their investigation. Comey said, ""We have no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI."" In her interview with Wallace, Clinton was making the point that what she told the public is consistent with what she told the FBI, and Comey said what she told the FBI was ""truthful,"" campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said. So Clinton’s statement implies that Comey has confirmed that her public comments are accurate. That is incorrect. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked Comey at the July 7 congressional hearing, ""Did she lie to the public?"" Comey responded, ""That's a question I'm not qualified to answer."" He also said he hadn’t compared Clinton’s public comments with the FBI interview to see if there were inconsistencies. There is no transcript of the FBI interview. When Comey announced the FBI’s findings July 5, it was clear that there are obvious inconsistencies between what Clinton said publicly about classified information on her private email server before her FBI interview and what the FBI found. Pointedly, Clinton said there wasn’t any classified information in her email, and he said there was. Take the video Wallace played on Fox News Sunday. In it, Clinton said, ""I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified materials"" (March 10, 2015); ""I am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time"" (July 25, 2015); ""I had not sent classified material nor received anything marked classified"" (Aug. 18, 2015). But Comey reported that, of the tens of thousands of emails investigators reviewed, 113 individual emails contained classified information, and three of them bore markings signifying their classification status. (Information can still be classified even if it does not have a label.) Eight email threads contained top-secret information, the highest level of classification, 36 contained secret information, and the remaining eight contained confidential information. About 2,000 emails have been retroactively classified, or up-classified, meaning the information was not classified when it was emailed, but it is now. ""Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,"" Comey said in a July 5 statement. Then, there was this exchange between Comey and Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., at the congressional hearing: Gowdy: ""Secretary Clinton said there was nothing marked classified on her emails either sent or received. Was that true?"" Comey: ""That’s not true."" Gowdy: ""Secretary Clinton said, ‘I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material.’ Was that true?"" Comey: ""There was classified material emailed."" In fairness to Clinton, Comey said some of the classified emails were insufficiently marked, and it’s understandable that she didn’t realize that some of the ones without labels were actually classified. But he also said of some of the classified emails that did not bear markings, ""There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about the matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation."" We’ll also note a couple other major inconsistencies between Clinton’s remarks and the FBI’s findings: Clinton repeatedly said she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department in 2014, about 30,000 emails. However, Comey said FBI investigators uncovered ""several thousand"" work-related emails that she had not handed over to the State Department. And, Clinton has said her email servers ""had numerous safeguards. It was on property guarded by the Secret Service. And there were no security breaches."" Comey said that while there’s no evidence anyone successfully hacked Clinton’s email servers, they certainly were susceptible to attack. There was no full-time security staff, which are found at government agencies and commercial email providers like Google. Further, he noted that Clinton used her personal email abroad, which could have allowed ""hostile actors"" to access her account. Our ruling Clinton said regarding the presence of classified information in her email, FBI director James ""Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people."" A reasonable person would interpret Clinton’s statement to mean that Comey has endorsed her public remarks about her email. This is not the case. Talking specifically about Clinton’s closed-door FBI interview, Comey said there is ""no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI"" about her email practices. But Comey has specifically declined to comment on whether Clinton’s public remarks have been accurate. Further, while not explicitly rebuking Clinton’s public comments, Comey highlighted a major problem with them. Clinton repeatedly said she did not have any classified information whatsoever in her email, marked or unmarked. After the FBI investigation, including the interview with Clinton, Comey said she unequivocally did.

Are Liberian girls more likely to be married than literate by the age of 18?
","Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist and author Tina Rosenberg recently drew attention to a shocking statistic about women’s education in the African country of Liberia. ""This is education in Liberia,"" Rosenberg wrote in the New York Times on June 14. ""A girl is more likely to be married by 18 than to know how to read."" Liberia was devastated by civil war between 1989 and 2003. More recently, its schools were closed for six months following the outbreak of the Ebola virus in 2014. Our partners at Africa Check looked at the available survey data to determine the accuracy of Rosenberg’s claim. Recent data doesn’t support claim Rosenberg, who won the Pulitzer for non-fiction The Haunted Land: Facing Europe's Ghosts After Communism, told Africa Check that her claim was based on a Liberian database of statistics collected from the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF). The database reported that 37.9 percent of children are married in Liberia by 18. That is fractionally higher than the female youth literacy rate of 37.2 percent, according to the UNICEF database. The problem is those figures come from 2007 reports and are out of date. The 37.9 percent figure for child marriage appears to track back to Liberia’s Demographic and Health Survey from 2007. The youth literacy figure is likely from a 2007 UNESCO Institute for Statistics’ estimate. The estimate covers women between the ages of 15-24, not just girls 18 and under. The most recent data comes from the country’s 2013 Demographic and Health Survey. Teen marriage rates in Liberia The Demographic and Health Survey presents data in five year increments for people aged 15 to 49. Women who are 18 fall into the youngest age group of 15 to 19. However, the survey is missing data for marriage rates for this age group. Instead, a United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund note on interpreting child marriage data recommends using the next age group: ""Looking at the group of women 20 to 24 years old is simpler and allows for the inclusion of all girls who were married or in union by age 18 within the closest time period for which complete data are available."" Following this standard, the 2013 Demographic and Health Survey shows that 35.9 percent of Liberian women aged 20 to 24 reported being married by the time they were 18. This method is imperfect because it doesn’t tell us about the chances that a girl under 20 today will have been married by 18. However, it gives us the best estimate for youth marriage rates for a group of young women who could reasonably be called girls. Literacy rates in Liberia The 2013 survey reported a literacy rate of 64.2 percent for women between 15 and 24 years of age. Someone is considered literate if they went to high school or if they can read a whole sentence or part of that sentence. The literacy rate decreases slightly to 58.9 percent when you look at women ages 20 to 24. Other organizations define literacy more strictly. For example, UNESCO doesn’t include people who can only read part of a sentence in the literate population. If we apply UNESCO’s literacy definition to Liberian women aged aged 20 to 24, literacy drops to 51.2 percent – still much higher than the marriage figure of 35.9 percent. Our Ruling Rosenberg made the claim that a Liberian woman is ""more likely to be married by 18 than to know how to read."" This claim relies on data from an old 2007 survey. Using a more recent survey and the closest age group for which data are available, the comparison doesn’t hold. Young Liberian women are more likely to know how to read than be married. We rate this claim Mostly False. This fact-check originally was published by Africa Check.

Sen. Sherrod Brown says Trump tax cut is for 'millionaires like himself'
","Just days after revealing that he’d been through a deep vetting process as a choice for vice president -- but wasn’t picked -- Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown took the stage on the final day of the convention in Philadelphia. Brown, who insisted all along that his gig representing Ohio is satisfying enough, delivered a speech that drew contrasts between nominees Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. ""While Trump outsources jobs, Hillary Clinton has a real plan to bring jobs back to America – like a $10 billion ‘Made in America’ plan with tax credits to revitalize manufacturing,"" Brown said. ""Trump proposes tax cuts, too – $3 trillion for millionaires like himself and $2 trillion for corporations like his. Of course we can’t say for sure how much Trump will take for himself, because he’s refused to share his tax returns with the American People."" It’s been widely reported that Trump’s tax plan generously favors the top one-percent of Americans. We asked Brown’s Senate office for his sources of the numbers ""$3 trillion"" and ""$2 trillion."" Trillions tend to sound exaggerated -- maybe because that many zeroes make our eyeballs swim. Rachel Petri, from Brown’s senate office, offered a piece from Citizens for Tax Justice to back up the claim about Trump’s planned corporate tax cuts.   Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal think tank, plotted a hypothetical analysis of Trump’s proposal, if implemented in 2016. They found that the changes would equal $12 trillion less revenue collected in federal taxes over the next decade. ""This includes $9.6 trillion in personal income tax cuts, $2 trillion in corporate income tax cuts, and the $300 billion cost of repealing estate and gift taxes,"" according to the report (emphasis ours). Petri said that the $3 trillion for millionaires figure comes from data from the Tax Policy Center, which was analyzed by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. That report estimates that the tax cuts going to millionaires would result in a loss of revenue collected by approximately $3.2 trillion over 10 years. Since both groups Brown pulled stats from are liberal-leaning, we looked for a report from a source that skews conservative. One such group, the Tax Foundation, reported a cost of $1.54 trillion for Trump’s corporate tax cuts over 10 years. Though that is off by half a trillion, rounding up would get it to Brown’s $2 trillion quote. The Tax Foundation estimates $10.2 trillion less revenue over a decade due to reduced individual tax rates. The top one-percent of earners would see 27 percent of the cut under the plan, which is about $2.75 trillion. (Correction Aug. 2, 2016: An earlier version of this fact-check had a different calculation.) Again, rounding up gets it to Brown’s $3 trillion under this analysis. Trump is no longer the presumptive Republican candidate, but this is a presumptive tax plan. In May, Trump tapped two all-stars of conservative fiscal policy to help with a revamp. As of yet, Trump Tax 2.0 is still pending. Our ruling Addressing the DNC, Brown said that Trump’s tax plan would cut ""$3 trillion for millionaires like himself and $2 trillion for corporations like his.""  Those numbers basically check out, via Brown’s think-tank sources. A conservative group’s analysis fell a little shorter, but supports Brown when rounded up. It’s all subject to change upon the unveiling of Trump’s Tax Plan Part Two. But it is accurate as of Brown’s speech. We rate the statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0b1c5101-f92c-4d53-b889-a223ba2ead27",/factchecks/2016/aug/01/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-trump-tax-cut-millionaires-/

Donald Trump gets a Full Flop for whether he's had a relationship to Vladimir Putin
","The intrusion into the Democratic National Committee’s computers, allegedly by Russian hackers, has put a renewed spotlight on Donald Trump’s connections to Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin. When Trump sat for an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos shortly after the Democratic National Convention, Stephanopoulos brought up the topic. Trump told Stephanopoulos that he didn’t have a relationship with Putin. Stephanopoulos challenged him on this -- and the host was on solid ground. Trump’s denial of a relationship with Putin contradicted what he had said on multiple previous occasions. Prior to early 2016, Trump seemed to tout his ties to the Russian leader. Trump, a lifelong businessman, boasted of foreign policy experience based on his experience hosting the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013. For instance, during an interview with Fox News on May 6, 2016, Trump told host Bret Baier, ""I know Russia well. I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago, Miss Universe contest, which was a big, big, incredible event. An incredible success."" But the closeness Trump claims to Putin-era Russia has prompted questions from critics, including foreign policy professionals in both parties. The U.S.  government sees Russia as a geopolitical rival and Putin in particular as a sometimes problematic force in international relations. Trump’s seeming fondness for Putin has worried critics in both parties. For instance, Trump took flak a few days before the Stephanopoulos interview after he seemed to encourage Russia to spy on the United States in order to find thousands of Hillary Clinton’s emails. ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" he said. ""I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press,"" Trump said during a news conference in Florida."" So, facing growing questions about the wisdom of attaching his star to Putin’s, has Trump changed his position on whether the two have had a relationship? Here’s a closer look. Trump’s earlier comments suggesting a relationship with Putin Here are four occasions between 2013 and 2015 when Trump touted his ties to Putin. • When Thomas Roberts of MSNBC asked Trump, ""Do you have a relationship with Vladimir Putin? A conversational relationship or anything that you feel you have sway or influence over his government?"" Trump responded, ""I do have a relationship, and I can tell you that he's very interested in what we're doing here today. He's probably very interested in what you and I am saying today, and I'm sure he's going to be seeing it in some form."" -- interview, November, 2013 • ""You know, I was in Moscow a couple of months ago. I own the Miss Universe Pageant and they treated me so great. Putin even sent me a present, a beautiful present."" -- address at the CPAC conference, March 2014 • ""Russia does not respect our country any longer. They see we've been greatly weakened, both militarily and otherwise, and he certainly does not respect President Obama. So what I would do—as an example, I own Miss Universe, I was in Russia, I was in Moscow recently and I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin, who could not have been nicer, and we had a tremendous success. The show was live from Moscow, and we had tremendous success there and it was amazing, but to do well, you have to get the other side to respect you, and he does not respect our president, which is very sad."" -- address at the National Press Club, May 2014 • ""As far as the Ukraine is concerned … if Putin wants to go in -- and I got to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes. We were stablemates, and we did very well that night."" -- portion of an answer at the Fox Business News debate, Nov. 2015. (The notion that the two men appeared together on 60 Minutes has been debunked. As Time magazine put it succinctly, ""In fact, they weren’t even on the same continent."") The Stephanopoulos interview Recently, though, Trump has changed his tune. Here are excerpts from the Trump-Stephanopoulos interview, which aired on ABC’s This Week on July 31. Stephanopoulos: ""Let's talk about Russia. You made a lot of headlines with Russia this week. What exactly is your relationship with Vladimir Putin?"" Trump: ""I have no relationship to -- with him. I have no relationship with him."" Stephanopoulos: ""But if you have no relationship with Putin, then why did you say in 2013, I do have a relationship. In 2014, I spoke…"" Trump: ""Because he has said nice things about me over the years. I remember years ago, he said something -- many years ago, he said something very nice about me. I said something good about him when Larry King was on. This was a long time ago. And I said he is a tough cookie or something to that effect. He said something nice about me. This has been going on. We did 60 Minutes together. By the way, not together-together, meaning he was probably shot in Moscow…."" Stephanopoulos: ""Well, he was in Moscow…."" Trump: ""And I was shot in New York."" Stephanopoulos: ""You were in New York. But that's the thing."" Trump: ""No, just so you understand, he said very nice things about me, but I have no relationship with him. I don't -- I've never met him. … I have no relationship with Putin. I don't think I've ever met him. I never met him. … I mean if he's in the same room or something. But I don't think so. ..."" Stephanopoulos: ""You've never spoken to him on the phone?"" Trump: ""I have never spoken to him on the phone, no. … Well, I don't know what it means by having a relationship. I mean he was saying very good things about me, but I don't have a relationship with him. I didn't meet him. I haven't spent time with him. I didn't have dinner with him. I didn't go hiking with him. I don't know -- and I wouldn't know him from Adam except I see his picture and I would know what he looks like."" Also, on July 27, Trump said at a press conference in Florida, ""I never met Putin -- I don't know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin."" For the record: Media outlets have said the more accurate translation for what Putin said was ""flamboyant,"" rather than ""genius,"" and Putin subsequently confirmed that he was trying to indicate ""flamboyant"" when he made his his remark. Our ruling Trump has changed what he’s said about whether he’s had a relationship with Putin. In 2013, he said, ""I do have a relationship."" In 2014 he said, ""I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin"" and said the Russian leader had sent him a present. In 2015, he said, ""I got to know him very well"" due to their joint appearance on 60 Minutes. More recently, though, Trump has said, ""I never met Putin -- I don't know who Putin is"" and ""I have no relationship with him.""

Actor James Woods peddles bogus quote from Hillary Clinton's 'It Takes a Village'
","Actor James Woods took aim at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on Twitter, using her own words against her to suggest she would create a ""nanny state."" Woods tweeted an image attributing to Clinton a quote from her 1996 book, It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us, asking viewers to ""Read this. Twice."" ""I believe the primary role of the state  is to teach, train and raise children. Parents have a secondary role,"" the quote reads. There’s just one problem.

At the time, we looked at her book on Google Books and searched for the quote both on Google and on Lexis-Nexis. We did not find the quote then, and we didn’t this time after re-doing the search. The Clinton campaign declined to comment. We found quotes from the book making the opposite point. ""Parents bear the first and primary responsibility for their sons and daughters — to feed them, to sing them to sleep, to teach them to ride a bike, to encourage their talents, to help them develop spiritual lives, to make countless daily decisions that determine whom they have the potential to become,"" the book says on page four. The word ""secondary"" does not even show up in the book, our search showed. It Takes A Village has been criticized for suggesting society was responsible for parenting children, and Clinton does argue that society at large — government included — has a role in a child’s development. ""But I was also blessed with caring neighbors, attentive doctors, challenging public schools, safe streets, and an economy that supported my father’s job,"" she wrote. ""Much of my family’s good fortune was beyond my parents’ direct control, but not beyond the control of other adults whose actions affected my life."" She does not say, however, that ""parents have a secondary role,"" as Woods alleged. Paul Kengor, a professor of political science at Grove City College and a Ronald Reagan biographer, said there is a typical divide in how conservatives and liberals (such as Clinton) view child care. He said it was conceivable Clinton would support a primary role for the state due to her liberal persuasion. William Chafe, a history professor at Duke University, disagreed. He said the book's message was to uphold a community commitment to the well-being of women and children, not to shift responsibility, calling the latter a ""willful misreading."" What societal role is too much is for readers to decide, but the quote is fabricated. Our ruling Woods claimed that Clinton wrote that ""the primary role of the state is to teach, train and raise children. Parents have a secondary role."" That’s a bogus quote attributed to Clinton’s book It Takes a Village. We rate Wood’s claim Pants on Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/35155d42-dcb3-42d1-98e0-c97b41e96061",/factchecks/2016/aug/01/james-woods/actor-james-woods-uses-fabricated-hillary-clinton-/

Sorry, Hillary: Trump actually has made a few things in the USA
","Hillary Clinton followed her history-making DNC speech by staying in Philadelphia for an extra day and giving yet another speech Friday. The location was different, Temple University on North Broad Street rather than the Wells Fargo Center on South Broad, but much of the message was the same, primarily because she spent time attacking Donald Trump. At one point during the speech, Clinton said, ""He doesn't make a thing in America."" The comment came after a week of DNC speakers taking shots at Trump. Multiple politicians, including U.S. Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Clinton, pointed out many of Trump’s products are made in foreign countries, such as his vodka and his neckties. These are indeed made overseas. But what about everything? Has Trump really not made a thing in America? This was a quick fact to check. While many of his products have been made overseas, some are made in America, such as his suits. Amazon features more than a dozen Trump-brand suits. Yes, some are made in China and some have no country listed for where they’re made. But some are made in the United States. A previous PolitiFact check also found Trump-brand wine to be made here in the U.S. For a product to be considered made in the USA, according to the Federal Trade Commission, ""all or virtually all"" of the product has to be made in the United States. The FTC can bring legal action against companies suspected of making misleading claims about the origins of their products.    On Trump’s website, he sells several apparel items, including the ""Make America Great Again"" hats, as well as t-shirts, signs and buttons. All of them are said to be made in America. Though photos on the internet circulated of one of his hats having been made in China, PolitiFact found that wasn’t true. According to the AP, the ""Make America Great Again"" hats are stitched at a small factory in Los Angeles. Workers at the factory in which the Make America Great Again hats are made told the AP the some of the materials that go into the hats are imported. Clinton’s campaign responded to an inquiry about Clinton’s statement by providing links to articles explaining where certain Trump items are made. It did not respond to questions about why Clinton said Trump had not made a thing in America or whether the campaign has discovered discrepancies in where Trump items are made that have not been reported. Our ruling Speaking in a packed Temple University gym, Hillary Clinton questioned Donald Trump’s ability to create jobs for Americans and said, ""He doesn't make a thing in America."" Many of Trump’s products are made overseas, but not all of them. At the least, some of his suits and the campaign memorabilia he sells on his website are made in the United States. We rule the claim False.",/factchecks/2016/aug/01/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-went-overboard-calling-out-donald-/

Trump campaign wrong about Clinton influence on debates against Sanders, Trump
","The day after Hillary Clinton wrapped up the Democratic nomination for president, Republican rival Donald Trump was already accusing her of ""rigging"" the presidential debates to coincide with NFL games in the fall. ""As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!"" Trump tweeted. Trump doubled down on his charge Sunday, telling ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that he ""got a letter from the NFL saying this is ridiculous"" (which the NFL denies). Campaign chairman Paul Manafort echoed the complaint on NBC’s Meet the Press. ""The DNC hack showed you that the Clinton campaign was working to schedule debates against (Bernie) Sanders, which have the least possible viewing audience. Mr. Trump’s saying, Look we want the maximum viewing audience,"" Manafort said. ""We're not going to fall ploy to the Hillary Clinton ploy that she did against Bernie Sanders of trying to have the lowest viewing audience. We want the biggest."" It is well-established that the Democrats held fewer primary debates on nights with a lighter audience and with more popular programming. However, Manafort’s statement overplays what’s in the DNC emails and ignores how presidential primary and general election debates are actually set. There is no evidence in leaked DNC emails that the Clinton campaign lobbied for weekend dates or fewer debates in her primary fight against Sanders. There is also no evidence that the Clinton campaign had any hand in the setting the debates between Trump and Clinton. A bipartisan commission released the chosen dates 11 months before Clinton and Trump secured the party’s nomination. Debating the Democratic debates We asked the Trump campaign for specific emails released by WikiLeaks that prove Manafort’s point about the Clinton campaign colluding to minimize debate viewership, but we didn’t hear back. Our own search turned up no smoking emails. The party announced it would host six debates in May 2015, and released in August dates for the first four square-offs — three of which fell on weekends. Many criticized the DNC for the paucity and poor timing of these debates, and experts we spoke with agreed that the schedule benefitted Clinton. Not only, however, do zero emails in the WikiLeaks DNC archive involve anything about the scheduling of these planned debates. There is also no proof of the Clinton campaign having any say over the dates. In most exchanges, DNC staffers are discussing logistics (i.e. asking MSNBC if anchor Chris Matthews would be willing to meet with donors and requesting expense invoices) or media coverage and backlash. Overall, there’s no evidence of intent to harm Sanders with the debates or collusion between the Clinton camp and the DNC, said Kathleen Jamieson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who wrote the book Presidential Debates: The Challenge of Creating an Informed Electorate. Aaron Kall, the director of debate at the University of Michigan, commended the DNC for adding three more debates after a series of primary wins for Sanders in early 2016. He said the changed philosophy may be the best evidence that the DNC was listening to Democratic voters. A scuttled Fox debate Manafort may have been alluding to a few email threads that detail negotiations over a fourth Fox News debate in California that ultimately didn’t happen. While some backs-and-forth indicate a lack of enthusiasm, they do not show the DNC or the Clinton actively trying to schedule the debate to hurt Sanders. Former DNC chair Wasserman Schultz wasn’t thrilled about the idea at first, but her objection seemed to be Fox News hosting, not the idea of an extra debate in general. ""Boy, they (Fox News) are laying it on thick,"" she wrote May 13. ""The RNC would never do an MSNBC debate for the same reason that we shouldn't do this one."" Negotiations nonetheless continued as the Clinton campaign and DNC seemed to be at odds with the Sanders campaign over whether the debate would be sanctioned by the party (which would give the DNC more control). Fox eventually sent invites to both camps with the DNC’s blessing, and Sanders campaign spokesman Michael Briggs emailed the DNC May 18 notifying them that Sanders had accepted the invite. ""Lol,"" responded DNC communications director Luis Miranda. Wasserman Schultz told her staffers that the Clinton declined to ""take the bait"" May 19, and the Clinton campaign declined Fox’s invite a few days later, squashing the possibility of a fourth debate. Wasserman Schultz addressed the criticism lobbed at her for the debates specifically in an May 18 email, pushing back on the notion she ""put them on weekends so people wouldn’t see them"" and arguing that the DNC worked with the networks and campaigns on the dates. ""Debates were a success! And when he (Sanders) wanted more, she went to bat with the Clinton campaign and got more debates,"" Wasserman Schultz wrote. General confusion, not collusion Manafort’s second charge that Clinton had something to do with putting two general election debates on nights with football games is less credible. The Commission on Presidential Debates is a bipartisan organization that works independently of the campaigns. As our friends at the Washington Post Fact-Checker pointed out, the commission released its schedule in September 2015, long before Trump and Clinton became party nominees and long before the NFL released its schedule in April 2016. ""The Commission on Presidential Debates started working more than 18 months ago to identify religious and federal holidays, baseball league playoff games, NFL games, and other events in order to select the best nights for the 2016 debate. It is impossible to avoid all sporting events, and there have been nights on which debates and games occurred in most election cycles. A debate has never been rescheduled as a result,"" the commission said in a statement. The Trump campaign’s charges are ""absolutely baseless,"" said Alan Schroeder, a professor at Northeastern University who wrote Presidential Debates: Fifty Years of High-Risk TV. ""There is no rigging, and nothing different about this year's schedule from previous cycles,"" Schroeder told us. Kall of the University of Michigan said the commission does not consult the campaigns during the planning process. ""They don’t talk to any of the campaigns. They come up with a schedule that works with the hosts and they also have to juggle religious holidays."" Given that there are 256 NFL games from early September to December, Kall said, it would be near impossible to schedule a debate that wasn’t on a weekend or holiday and didn’t coincide with a game. Plus, it’s happened before, Jamieson reminded us. Take, for example, the last debate of the 2012 presidential election. It occurred Oct. 22, the same night as a Detroit Lions game against the Chicago Bears. It still pulled in 59.2 million viewers. Trump and Clinton’s sparring will likely draw even bigger audiences considering Trump’s ability to command press and public attention and Clinton’s decades-long tenure in the political limelight. Even with the NFL conflicts, Kall told us he expects at least 70 million if not 100 million viewers. In other words, Trump will probably get his maximum viewing audience. Our ruling Manafort said, ""The DNC hack showed you that the Clinton campaign was working to schedule debates against Sanders"" and the Clinton campaign is continuing this ""ploy"" against Trump. Experts agree the Democratic primary debate schedule was more advantageous to Clinton than Sanders, but there is no evidence in the DNC emails that show Clinton conspired to make this happen. As for the notion that Clinton rigged the presidential debate schedule ahead of the general election, experts told us it’s pretty absurd. The commission that plans the debates released its schedule six months before the NFL released theirs, and almost a year before Clinton and Trump became the Democratic and Republican nominees.   We rate Manafort’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3d3d7132-4bb2-4d4e-bb0a-96b66d4f2b0d",/factchecks/2016/jul/31/paul-manafort/trump-campaign-chief-dnc-leak-proves-clinton-campa/
