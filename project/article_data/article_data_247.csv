Sexual assault, domestic violence themselves are not pre-existing conditions under GOP health bill
","Democrats savaged the Republican legislation, pushed by President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, that would replace Obamacare. ""Under ‘Trumpcare,’"" U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin declared in a May 4, 2017 news release, ""being a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault could be considered pre-existing conditions."" The claim by Moore, who has talked publicly about being a victim of domestic violence and sexual assault herself, cuts to one of the big fears around health care -- that having something that is considered a pre-existing condition means a person has to pay more for insurance, or could be denied coverage altogether. Typically, this refers to things such as diabetes or cancer. But sexual assault or domestic violence? Obamacare vs ‘Trumpcare’ The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is the 2010 legislation adopted under President Barack Obama. It prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage -- or charging higher premiums -- because a person has a pre-existing medical condition. Under the American Health Care Act (sometimes called ""Trumpcare""), insurers would still be prohibited from denying coverage based on a pre-existing condition. The bill was narrowly approved by the House of Representatives and could be changed in the Senate. But in its current form, the bill would give states the option to allow insurers to charge people with pre-existing conditions higher prices. Republicans argue those people would be protected, because those states would have to set up high-risk pools to insure people with pre-existing conditions. But many analysts believe the law would still leave those people more vulnerable to cost increases that could make their plans unaffordable. (The day after the House passed the bill, GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said he would consider allowing insurers to charge higher prices. But later that day -- in an indication of how politically touchy the issue is -- he backed away from that comment after it drew criticism.) Pre-existing conditions Bloggers claimed that under the GOP bill, sexual assault is a pre-existing condition, which PolitiFact National rated Mostly False. PolitiFact National spelled out what would happen under the GOP bill regarding sexual assault and experts told us that the same would apply to domestic violence. In a nutshell: The bill does not single out any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition. Conditions stemming from a sexual assault or domestic violence, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or certain sexually transmitted diseases, could be judged to be a pre-existing condition. States would have the option to allow insurers to charge higher prices to people with an existing condition, possibly making coverage unaffordable. Our rating Moore says that ""under ‘Trumpcare,’"" the Republican replacement for Obamacare, domestic violence and sexual assault ""could be considered pre-existing conditions"" -- something that could trigger higher insurance prices for those victims. Moore’s claim goes too far. Simply being a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault would not mean a person had a pre-existing condition. But it is important to know that conditions stemming from those assaults, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, could. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/may/09/gwen-moore/sexual-assault-domestic-violence-themselves-are-no/

No, coffee is not the second-most traded commodity after oil
","Starbucks has a reputation for serving a strong cup of joe, but the ubiquitous coffee retailer’s director of public policy offered a claim on Capitol Hill that turns out to be a thin brew. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee invited Starbucks’ Kelly Goodejohn to talk about how doing well can mean doing good. A 20-year veteran of the coffee trade, Goodejohn had some key points for the senators. ""Coffee is grown in challenging regions, often with war-torn pasts, but we have seen coffee as a stabilizing force that provides prosperity and economic stability,"" she said. Coffee, Goodejohn said, is a big economic deal. ""Coffee is the second-most traded commodity after oil, and 25 million farmers around the world rely on income generated from growing coffee,"" she said. Holy latte! We’ve all seen coffee take off in America, but are those beans really the other black gold? We decided to check Goodejohn’s ranking of oil and coffee. The hard numbers show her statement has been provably incorrect for about as long as Goodejohn has been in the business. Comparing the goods Part 1: Market size Since oil comes in barrels and coffee beans in 60 kilogram sacks, you can’t just stack them side by side. So the most obvious comparison is the dollar value of the world market for each. The United Nations trade statistics branch estimated the oil export market at $788 billion in 2015. The estimate for aluminum was $106 billion, for copper $104 billion, and iron ore and concentrates $67 billion. Calculating the world market for coffee is a little trickier because the United Nations trade data lumps coffee in with other products that contain even just a trace of coffee, such as powdered mixes. With help from John Baffes, senior economist at the World Bank’s Development Prospects Group, we estimated the size of the coffee export market at about $19 billion. (We got the amount of coffee sold from the International Coffee Organization and the average price per kilogram from the World Bank. Baffes confirmed our math.) The Starbucks press office pointed to a report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development that estimated the total market at $23 billion. The keen observer will note that the coffee market is about one-fourth as large as the markets for aluminum and copper, and also less than the market in iron ore. But what about other agricultural products? Based on sales data from the U.S. Agriculture Department and the World Bank’s price data, the world market for wheat was $29 billion and for soybeans, $57 billion. Both beat out coffee. Baffes, who co-authored a report on global commodity markets in 2000, said the claim about coffee being second only to oil is old news. ""This used to be the case back in 1970,"" Baffes said. ""However, later grains and metals overtook coffee."" In that 2000 report, coffee ranked 15th, bested by, among others, hardwood logs, bananas and gold. Over the years, there have been several efforts to correct the record. Science writer Mark Pendergrast included the errant claim in his 1999 book Uncommon Grounds: The History of Coffee and How It Transformed Our World. Ten years later, he wrote a correction (and fixed the error in the second edition). ""I was wrong, and so is everyone else who keeps repeating this myth,"" he wrote in 2009. Voices in the coffee industry itself have also tried to rebut the claim. At one time, coffee represented the second-most valuable commodity exported by developing countries, but there’s no evidence that’s still the case. Comparing the goods Part 2: Futures trading When we asked the Starbucks organization for the source behind Goodejohn’s claim, the press office suggested we look at a webpage on commodities trading. The site is a consumer guide to investing in commodities, and it said, ""Coffee is the most traded commodity after oil."" This seemed to suggest that Starbucks had another yardstick in mind -- the number or value of coffee contracts bought and sold by investors. In other words, we shouldn’t measure the amount of actual coffee or costs, but the bets on coffee prices. We found several similar websites that repeat the claim, such as Investorguide.com, Economics.help and a Kenyan-based training group called Institute of Trade Development. None of these sites say how they reached this conclusion. In contrast, the Futures Industry Association, a reliable source of commodity trading data, posts annual data. In its 2016 survey of the number of contracts traded, soybeans and rapeseed meal (or canola meal) top the list of the 20 highest volume-traded agricultural contracts. Coffee contracts don’t show up in the top 20. Coffee Co-mission, a group of small coffee roasters based in Winston-Salem, N.C., went through this comparison in 2015 and found that among commodities ""whether the measure is by quantity or value, coffee does not even make the top 100."" Pendergrast said, ""I don't think that this urban coffee myth has ever been true, regardless of how you look at it."" Our ruling A Starbucks executive said coffee is the second-most traded commodity after oil. We examined it two ways, and the statement failed on both. The markets for several commodities including soybeans, wheat, aluminum, copper and iron ore are larger than the coffee market -- in some cases, four times larger. The statistic also falls short in terms of the commodity contracts traded by investors. Both the number of coffee contracts traded and the value of contracts are much lower than for many other commodities. This claim has been challenged since 2000 by economists, journalists and voices in the coffee industry. But it still found its way into a congressional hearing despite being very, very wrong.

Some sex offenders will be allowed to drive for Uber and Lyft
","When ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft start in upstate New York in July, will registered sex offenders be allowed behind the wheel? Republicans in the State Senate have introduced a bill that would prohibit all sex offenders from driving for the ride-hailing companies. State Sen. Thomas D. Croci, R-Long Island, said that when lawmakers passed legislation this year allowing the companies to operate upstate, they left a loophole allowing some who are on New York's Sex Offender Registry to drive for the companies. Lower-level sex offenders can become drivers seven years after their prison release ""Allowing anyone who appears on the New York State Sex Offender Registry to be drivers for ride-share companies presents an unacceptable risk to our citizens,"" Croci said in a statement. Is Croci right? Can some sex offenders drive for Uber and Lyft? What’s in the law? Lawmakers in April added a new section to the state Vehicle and Traffic Law allowing ride-hailing companies to operate outside of New York City. The legislation outlines who can drive for those companies and what type of auto insurance they must carry. The law requires ride-hailing companies to perform a background check on prospective drivers. They have to check New York’s Sex Offender Registry and the National Sex Offender Public Registry. Those who are on the national registry are barred from ever driving for ride-hailing companies. But not all registered sex offenders are on it. New York state recognizes three levels of sex offenders, based on their risk of committing another sex crime. Those categorized as Level 1 pose the lowest risk. Level 2 and Level 3 offenders pose moderate and high risks, respectively. New York state’s Level 2 and Level 3 offenders are listed on the national registry, and they remain on it for life. So they will never be able to drive for the companies. The waiting period New York state's Level 1 offenders are not on the national registry. And, state law does not allow information about Level 1 sex offenders to be posted online. Federal agencies have access to the information but state law blocks it from being posted on the national registry. That does not mean all Level 1 sex offenders can drive for the ride-hailing companies. Level 1 offenders must wait seven years after their release from jail or prison before they are allowed to drive. If the offenders are not incarcerated, the seven-year waiting period starts when they are convicted, according to state law. It is not just sex offenders who can eventually drive for ride-hailing companies.Several other crimes have a waiting period to drive for Uber or Lyft, according to the law. Someone convicted of manslaughter or a burglary would be eligible to drive for Uber or Lyft seven years after their conviction or release. A misdemeanor offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs has a three-year waiting period. Our ruling Croci, a state senator from Long Island, said that in some cases a sex offender ""who appears on the New York State Sex Offender Registry"" would be able to drive for Uber or Lyft. Level 1 sex offenders are not listed on the national sex offender registry, and would therefore be allowed to drive for ride-hailing companies seven years after they are released from prison or, if they were not incarcerated, after their conviction.  Croci’s statement is True.",/factchecks/2017/may/08/thomas-croci/some-sex-offenders-will-be-allowed-drive-uber-and-/

Tom Price misleads on Obamacare tax penalty
","Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price argued that people are currently uninsured because they don’t like Obamacare. ""When I talk to the doctors that I used to practice with right here in Atlanta, what they tell me is that the current system isn't working for them or for their patients,"" Price said in a May 7 interview on CNN’s State of the Union. ""We have got 20 million folks out there across this land who have told the federal government, ‘Phooey, nonsense, I'm not going to participate in your program because it doesn't do what I need done,"" he said. ""So, they are paying a penalty. They're paying the IRS a fine or a penalty because the federal government is dictating to them what they don't want to do, or they are saying, give me a waiver."" Price’s characterization leaves out a lot. Many of the 20 million are likely uninsured not as a personal preference, but because they still can’t find coverage. Penalty under the Affordable Care Act The Affordable Care Act includes an individual mandate to urge people to obtain health care coverage. The mandate that began in 2014 penalizes individuals for each month they lack health insurance that meets the minimum essential coverage. The penalty is assessed on tax returns and increases every year a person remains uninsured. The fee is whichever is higher: 2.5 percent of household income or $695 per adult or $347.50 per child. The mandate has many exemptions depending on income, membership in groups like Indian tribes, and incarceration. If individuals don’t fall into those categories, the health insurance marketplace lays out 14 categories that exempt people from the financial penalty if they cannot afford it, such as being homeless or filing for bankruptcy. The American Health Care Act passed by the House May 4 gets rid of the individual mandate, one of the least popular provisions of the law. In January, the Internal Revenue Service reported that in 2016 about 80 percent of taxpayers -- 117 million -- indicated on tax forms that they had qualifying coverage all year while about 12.7 million taxpayers claimed one or more exemptions. The most common exemption was for people who earned below a certain threshold in a state that didn’t expand Medicaid. Additionally, the IRS reported that 6.5 million taxpayers were paying a fine instead of getting insurance. Add that to the people who claimed exemptions from the penalty, and that totals 19.2 million, close to Price’s 20 million.   Still, that means just over 60 percent of the 20 million who aren’t insured are claiming exemptions. Steven Ullmann, director of the University of Miami’s Department of Health Sector Management and Policy, said millions of people struggle to find coverage because they aren’t eligible for Medicaid due to states not expanding Medicaid. There are also those who don’t qualify for the federal subsidy to purchase insurance through the exchanges. ""They are uninsured because there is no way that they can afford the insurance,"" he said. ""Then there are others, generally the ‘young invincibles,’ who find that the penalty of $695 is less than the cost of the insurance policies (generally over $2,000 a year),"" he said. ""They’d rather go bare and take their chances."" The penalty hasn’t had its intended effect of driving people to sign up for health care, said Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts. ""To be effective, the penalty almost certainly needs to be bigger,"" he said. ""And for a lot of obvious political reasons, that sort of tougher penalty is not in the cards now, nor was it plausible when the ACA was drafted. A weak penalty was the original sin of Obamacare."" Price's office didn't respond to our queries. His claim is similar to a statement by President Donald Trump at a Feb. 27 meeting with health insurance company executives. ""It's gotten so bad that nearly 20 million Americans have chosen to pay the penalty or received an exemption rather than buy insurance,"" Trump said. (That claim was debunked by fact-checkers including the Washington Post and CNN.) On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that gave federal agencies broad authority to defer or delay any part of the Affordable Care Act that costs anybody any money, including the penalty. The IRS said in February that it was reviewing Trump’s order ""but that legislative provisions of the ACA law are still in force until changed by the Congress, and taxpayers remain required to follow the law and pay what they may owe‎."" Our ruling Price said, ""We have got 20 million folks out there across this land who have told the federal government, ‘Phooey, nonsense, I’m not going to participate in your program, because it doesn’t do what I need done.’ "" Price mentioned the number of people who are either paying a fine because they don't have insurance or who are claiming an exemption, usually because they don't qualify for affordable coverage. About 6.5 million taxpayers reported the penalty in 2016 tax filings, and 12.7 million taxpayers claimed one or more exemptions, bringing the total to about 20 million. But Price makes it sound like all of those people are simply declining coverage. In reality, many can't qualify for affordable coverage, even if they would like to.

The post was flagged by Facebook users as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on fake news in users’ feeds. The post said Obama and the men were at an unnamed park in Chicago, and were charged with wanton endangerment of animals, public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance. Obama had been forbidden by her famous parents from going to any such party, the story said, but disappeared before turning up at the police station. This didn’t happen, of course, because the story is fake. It turned up on a few other websites around May 6. But it actually originated on May 5 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked.

Raul Labrador's claim that no one dies from lack of health care access: Pants on Fire
","What Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, told a restive town hall audience in Lewiston, Idaho, was destined to go viral. And it did. At the May 5, 2017, event, questioners asked the congressman about the Republicans’ vote the previous day on a major health care overhaul that would roll back many aspects of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, including limits on expanding Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor. ""You are mandating people on Medicaid accept dying,"" one audience member said. To which Labrador responded, ""No no, you know that line is so indefensible. Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care."" The crowd howled in protest, and the comment drew immediate national attention. Writing in CNN, political commentator Chris Cillizza awarded his ""Worst Week in Washington"" award to Labrador, saying that the congressman had essentially handed Democrats a video clip that was ""a ready-made attack line against every vulnerable House Republican."" Given all the attention to Labrador’s comment, we decided to fact-check it. It’s not our first time looking at a similar question. Because of varied results from academic papers, we have struggled since 2009 about how to rate claims that a specific number of people die every year because they were uninsured -- a common talking point for Democrats. We found it difficult to pinpoint a specific number. However, Labrador’s statement put a different twist on the question. Rather than saying that a specific number of people had died due to lack of health insurance, Labrador said that no one had. Could that be right? Labrador’s explanation When we contacted Labrador’s office, his staff pointed us to a Facebook post where he explained his remark the following day and accused the media for only focusing on a few seconds of a longer discussion.   ""During ten hours of town halls, one of my answers about health care wasn’t very elegant,"" Labrador wrote. ""I was responding to a false notion that the Republican health care plan will cause people to die in the streets, which I completely reject. ... In the five-second clip that the media is focusing on, I was trying to explain that all hospitals are required by law to treat patients in need of emergency care regardless of their ability to pay and that the Republican plan does not change that."" (Here’s the full exchange as posted by Labrador’s office.) However, even if you buy the argument that emergency room care would protect the uninsured, that leaves out a whole range of chronic and potentially deadly diseases -- from heart disease to diabetes -- that can be prevented only through long-term access to physicians. A literature review We found at least seven academic papers that detected a link between securing health insurance and a decline in mortality. In general, these papers present a stronger consensus that having insurance saves lives. • In 2002, a panel of more than a dozen medical specialists convened by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine estimated that 18,000 Americans had died in 2000 because they were uninsured. In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, published a paper that sought to update the IOM study with newer data. Replicating the study’s methodology, Dorn concluded that the figure should be increased to 22,000. • A 2009 American Journal of Public Health study concluded that a lack of health insurance ""is associated with as many as 44,789 deaths in the United States, more than those caused by kidney disease."" • Three studies looked at state-level expansions of Medicaid and in each case found ""significant"" improvements in mortality after such expansions of coverage. These include a 2012 New England Journal of Medicine study of New York, Maine, and Arizona by Harvard researchers, and a 2014 study of Massachusetts by researchers from Harvard and the Urban Institute. • A 2014 study published by the health policy publication Health Affairs looked at states that, at the time, had declined to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. It estimated that the 25 states studied would have collectively avoided between 7,000 and 17,000 deaths. • A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found improved survival rates for young adults with cancer after securing insurance under the Affordable Care Act. • A 2017 study in the journal Medical Care looked at a provision of the Affordable Care Act that allows young adults to be covered under a parent’s policy. The study found a decline in mortality among this population from diseases amenable to preventive treatment. (Mortality from trauma, such as car accidents, saw no decrease, as would be expected.) Any contrary views? We found two papers that might conceivably provide support for Labrador’s position. But as we’ll see, even the papers’ authors did not agree with Labrador. • A paper published in April 2009 in HSR: Health Services Research. In it, Richard Kronick of the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at the University of California (San Diego) School of Medicine, raised questions about the conclusions of the seminal Institute of Medicine study from 2002. Kronick’s study adjusted the data -- as the IOM had not -- for a number of demographic and health factors, including status as a smoker and body mass index, and found that doing so removed the excess number of deaths found in the original study. • A 2013 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine co-authored by Katherine Baicker of Harvard University compared about 6,000 patients in Oregon who got coverage through a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn’t. While the study found improvements in out-of-pocket medical spending and lower rates of depression among those who got coverage, key benchmarks for physical health -- including blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar -- did not improve in such patients. So we asked both of these papers’ authors whether their papers could be used as justification for what Labrador said. ""Rep. Labrador is misinformed,"" Kronick said. ""Common sense, as well as the accumulated weight of evidence is sufficient to convince any reasonable analyst that lack of health insurance results in excess morbidity (that is, sickness) and mortality."" Baicker, too, said she sees ""strong evidence"" that Labrador’s statement ""is false. I agree that the exact number is up for debate, but the fact that it is more than zero seems clear to me."" Every other health policy analyst who responded to us for this article agreed that Labrador was wrong. Some saw common sense as equally persuasive as the peer-reviewed research. ""I was just at a physicians’ meeting where people described patients they had treated who had died because of a lack of coverage,"" said Harold Pollack, an urban public health researcher at the University of Chicago. ""Everyone who does this for a living has personally experienced it in one way or another."" Our ruling At the town hall, Labrador said, ""Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care."" Extensive research over the previous decade generally points to tangible reductions in mortality after patients obtain health insurance. Two papers found more equivocal results, but we reached authors of both papers, and they agreed that their findings do not support Labrador’s remark. While the exact number of deaths saved by having health insurance is uncertain, the researchers we contacted agreed that the number is higher than zero -- probably quite a bit higher.

Don Huffines overstates share of Texas property taxes paid by businesses
","State Sen. Don Huffines, R-Dallas, all but scolded students and parents visiting the Texas Capitol who insisted their tax dollars should help improve public schools rather than help fund private schools. Huffines, who has pushed for private school vouchers and ""school choice"" legislation, asked the visitors from the Richardson school district why they feel they can decide where tax dollars should go when, he said, ""62 percent of all property taxes are paid by businesses,"" not individuals, according to a video of his Feb. 27, 2017, appearance taken by an audience member and posted on YouTube by the pro-Democratic Lone Star Project. Readers asked us to check the share of property taxes paid by businesses, which turned out not to be as straightforward a calculation as hoped. Huffines points to all taxes paid by businesses To our inquiry, a Huffines’ Senate aide, Brent Connett, said by phone the senator drew his ""62 percent"" figure for the business share of property taxes from data cited in a January 2017 research report by the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a nonpartisan business group. The report attributed the data to the Council on State Taxation, a Washington-based trade association for corporate businesses, ""Nationally,"" the Texas group reported,  ""business accounts for 44.1 percent of all state and local taxes. In Texas, business foots 61.5 percent of the total bill."" That’s a bit up from what we confirmed in a 2013 fact check finding Mostly True a claim by a Texas Association of Business leader that businesses were paying roughly 60 percent of all state and local taxes – not just property taxes. At the time, a state projection indicated businesses would soon foot 52 percent of all state taxes with residents covering 48 percent. Estimates of property taxes alone But in his appearance before the Richardson visitors, Huffines was speaking solely about the business share of property taxes collected by local jurisdictions including school districts and city and county governments. Hunting figures specific to property taxes only, we turned to the council’s December 2016 report, the same one cited by TTARA, analyzing taxes paid by businesses in the 50 states the year before. In fiscal 2015, the report says, ""Texas had the largest dollar increase in business property tax revenue for the third year in a row, collecting $1.3 billion more than in 2014."" We didn’t spot any breakdown of the business share of property taxes alone; otherwise, a chart  says Texas businesses paid $35 billion in local taxes that year, amounting to 63 percent of $55.3 billion in locally levied taxes including sales and property taxes. We had better luck with TTARA’s president, Dale Craymer, who told us its latest published foray into estimating the business share of property taxes was a May 2008 TTARA research report stating that in 2007, businesses paid 56.4 percent, or $19.5 billion, of $34.6 billion in property taxes collected statewide. Craymer said the association estimated the business share of property taxes starting from biennial reports by the Texas state comptroller breaking down the types of property of businesses and residents, also drawing on research by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which analyzes property taxes paid by different types of industry. The comptroller’s latest data, covering fiscal 2014-15 and published in December 2016, lists categories of property-taxpayers, but that data are hard to decipher because each one is further sorted by governmental jurisdictions with school districts and city governments, for instance, analyzed separately. Most of the 18 categories of property struck us as hard to divide into paid-by-business versus paid-by-others. Fair point, said Austin economist Stuart Greenfield and TTARA analyst John Kennedy. Both said that grouping the categories presented by the comptroller into ""businesses"" and ""residents"" isn’t a black-and-white exercise. For instance, Greenfield said, property taxes classified as ""multi-family residential"" lumps together taxes paid by residents and business owners. That said, the comptroller’s figures applicable to school districts alone suggest that homeowners through 2014-15 paid 43 percent of all school property taxes with others, including businesses, accounting for 57 percent. The 2008 TTARA report says Texas residents in 2007 paid $15.2 billion, or 43.7 percent, of all property taxes. Craymer told us the association subsequently analyzed property taxes collected in more recent years. Those results weren’t published, he said, but it looks like Texas businesses most recently have paid closer to 60 percent of all property taxes, though the percentage also fluctuates. So, per the comptroller’s research, businesses and other non-homeowners have lately accounted for 57 percent of all school property taxes and, according to TTARA, 60 percent of all property taxes. State comptroller’s projections Seeking a state estimate covering all property taxes paid by businesses, we connected with Kevin Lyons, spokesman for Comptroller Glenn Hegar, who gently said no dice. Lyons told us that the agency doesn’t track the business share of property taxes. Then again, he pointed us to biennial comptroller reports projecting business and consumer shares of property taxes levied by type of jurisdiction two years down the road. The latest report, published about three weeks before Huffines spoke, states that businesses in fiscal 2019, beginning Sept. 1, 2018, will likely account for 51.4 percent of what school districts raise in property taxes with individual consumers ponying up 48.6 percent. Among businesses, corporations, partnerships and sole proprietors are projected to provide 41.5, 8.3, and 1.6 percent shares, respectively. Greenfield, a former analyst for the comptroller’s office, said by phone the predicted shares of property taxes funded by ""individual consumers"" and businesses has remained consistent over time at around 48 percent and 52 percent, respectively, a point that held up in our review of the comptroller’s projections for fiscal 2013, 2015 and 2017. Our ruling Huffines said businesses pay 62 percent of all property taxes. That figure reflects the business share of all state and local taxes including sales taxes--not property taxes alone. Most recently, in contrast, a state projection predicts businesses will account for 51 percent of what school districts raise from property taxes in 2018-19--a share in keeping with previous projections.

Ivanka Trump's new book includes quote falsely and frequently attributed to John Quincy Adams
","Ivanka Trump’s new book Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success leans on a litany of inspirational quotes to help women balance their lives at home and the office. Featured voices include Walt Disney, Toni Morrison, Betty Friedan, Maya Angelou, Nelson Mandela, Estee Lauder, Sheryl Sandberg and our sixth president, John Quincy Adams. Trump used the following quote about leadership to tee off a passage about leading with purpose from any level: ""If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more, you are a leader."" John Quincy Adams Her decision to include this particular quote (page 179) may have been inspired by a 2015 tweet from her father, President Donald J. Trump. ""If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader."" – John Quincy Adams The quote gets good play in leadership circles and memes online. And it looks somewhat legitimate when you Google ""John Quincy Adams,"" appearing as the top quote. To our ears, you are more likely to hear this nugget of wisdom in management training than in the early period of our nation. We reached out to learn more from her publisher but did not hear back. While it’s impossible to prove someone never, ever said something, the quote has all the traces of being fake. The real person who said the quote, or at least a version of it, could be a woman known for celebrating her fake attributes, Dolly Parton. ""I've never seen that from J. Q. Adams,"" said H. W. Brands, a University of Texas at Austin presidential historian and author. ""It doesn't sound like him. He wasn't the dreamy type."" Brands continued: ""Adams had a rather crimped view of human nature. He thought most people were rascals. He disliked democracy because he thought it fostered pandering to people's baser instincts."" Adams was a prolific writer, in keeping with family tradition. He maintained a diary from 1779 to 1847, spanning more than 15,000 manuscript pages and 51 volumes. No, we did not read them all, nor did we review his complete correspondence and speeches from his time in the revolution and as a lawyer, diplomat, secretary of state, and president from 1825-1829. But we did talk with someone else well-versed in his considerable output: Sara Martin, editor in chief of The Adams Papers of the Massachusetts Historical Society. ""I am confident that this is not a JQA quotation,"" she said. ""It neither sounds like him, nor is it really the vein of political thought that he typically expresses in his quotations."" She sent us real quotes from Adams relating to leadership to show the difference, backed up with links to his diary entries. (Here’s the whole list.) ""But the man who expects that all mankind, or the circle in which he moves will treat him according to his real merits, must have very little experience in the ways of men."" Diary entry from Aug. 8, 1787 ""All zealots justify unworthy means by the sanctity of the end."" Diary entry from Aug. 3, 1788 ""A politician in this country must be the man of a party. I would fain be the man of my whole country."" Diary entry from Jan. 28, 1802 ""The tendency of all private associations to settle into factious cabals is the besetting sin of all elective governments."" Diary from entry from Oct. 2, 1844 You get the picture. The most-detailed effort to track down the real source of the leadership quote was Quote Investigator in 2011. The website concluded that the quote likely evolved from a version used by Parton before it was assigned to Adams in its current form. Quote Investigator found that the 1997 book The Most Important Thing I Know quotes the singer and actor as offering, ""If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader."" Our ruling The quotation Ivanka Trump chose, one of many, is a worthy reflection. But it was a silly and easily avoided mistake to assign the words to John Quincy Adams, as others on the internet have done, when there is no record of him saying it. There are a lot of other verified options. We rate this statement False.",/factchecks/2017/may/05/ivanka-trump/book-john-quincy-adams-quote/

Fake news says Bill O'Reilly beaten unconscious by liberal New Yorkers
","Ousted Fox News host Bill O’Reilly had already taken a drubbing over sexual harassment allegations, but fake news purveyors then started circulating a false story that he’d been beaten unconscious, too. ""Bill O’Reilly in critical condition after being attacked by ‘tolerant’ liberals,"" read a headline on a May 4, 2017, story at DailyUSAUpdate.com. We found the story posted on other websites, as well. The article was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to winnow fake news from users’ news feeds. The post — which again, is fake — said O’Reilly was buying bagels in New York when three men and two women began complaining about his treatment of women. O’Reilly was forced off Fox News Channel on April 19 and lost his show, The O’Reilly Factor, after multiple reports of sexual harassment. The New York Times had reported the network paid about $13 million to settle claims. The confrontation turned aggressive when the liberals (as identified in the story) attacked O’Reilly, dragging him into the street and kicking him until ""until he was unconscious and bleeding."" The attackers ran off, the post said, leaving O’Reilly with four broken ribs and a punctured lung. He possibly suffered ""a cardiac event,"" the story said. Except none of the details about an attack are true. There is no apparent way to contact DailyUSAUpdate.com administrators, who have hidden the site’s registration information. There were no reports from legitimate media sources that this event occurred, in any case. Surely such an attack would have been widely covered. The hoax came about a week after other reports that Ted Nugent had been killed in a hunting accident and Sarah Palin had been run off the road and was in a coma. The fake O’Reilly story originally came from TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. TheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.""

Headlines that say GOP bill makes sexual assault a pre-existing condition are misleading
","Some blogs this week circulated a bombastic claim about the House Republican health care plan: that it would make sexual assault a pre-existing condition that might result in denied coverage. ""Under Trumpcare plan, rape would be considered a pre-existing condition,"" said the Resistance Report May 3. ""In Trump’s America, rape is a pre-existing condition,"" read a headline by the Cut, a New York Magazine blog. We found similar headlines on Bustle and the Intellectualist, as well as in some viral tweets. We should say right off the bat that the Cut has since changed its headline and issued a correction, as did Mic. The updated headlines say sexual assault ""could"" be a pre-existing condition, which is more accurate because it is not so definitive. Here’s what’s wrong about the viral narrative. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because a person has a pre-existing medical condition. Republicans’ Affordable Care Act replacement — the American Health Care Act, which the House passed May 4 — weakens those protections. These blog posts get at a real problem with the Republican bill if it were to become law. Victims of sexual assault could, conceivably, find themselves in a situation where they can’t afford insurance because of medical issues that stem from their assault. But the headlines that say the GOP bill makes sexual assault a pre-existing condition are hyperbolic based on the what the bill actually says. They stoke fears that the bill singles out victims of sexual assault, limiting their access to health care specifically. But the Republican bill doesn’t pinpoint any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition; that’s something the insurance companies or individual states would decide. As it stands, anyone with a pre-existing condition could face problems. Problems prior to the Affordable Care Act The blogs discuss anecdotal stories of women who, prior to the Affordable Care Act, were sexually assaulted and then sought treatment stemming from that assault. Later, when these women tried to purchase health insurance, they were denied coverage. These women weren’t necessarily denied coverage because of the sexual assault; rather, it was because of residual treatment they sought afterward, such as taking HIV-preventative medication or seeing a therapist. None of the several health insurance experts we consulted were aware of insurance companies with policies that specify ""sexual assault"" or ""rape"" as a condition to consider when evaluating someone’s eligibility. But insurance resources did regularly list mental health issues or sexually-transmitted illnesses as pre-existing conditions. For example, if a person were pricked with a used needle or had consensual sex with someone they later discovered had HIV, that person might also take HIV preventatives. And because they took that medication, they, like some sexual assault victims, might have trouble buying health insurance on the open market. If a sexual assault victim chose not to seek medical treatment, he or she wouldn’t necessarily face the same challenge in getting insurance. ""This is not something specific about sexual assault,"" said Urban Institute senior fellow Linda Blumberg. ""But to the extent victims of sexual assault are needing to take this (HIV) medication, they’re very vulnerable in terms of getting insurance coverage in the future."" What repealing the Affordable Care Act could mean The Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent authority on health policy, recently wrote policy papers about pre-existing conditions prior to the Affordable Care Act and how repealing the law would affect women.  Neither of those two articles say sexual assault victims would face a particular challenge. The Republicans’ bill doesn’t change what is or is not a pre-existing condition. What it does is allow more consideration of pre-existing conditions than is permitted under the Affordable Care Act. ""The bill just leaves it to the imagination at this point,"" Blumberg said, referring to what insurance companies might consider as a pre-existing condition. To be clear, the bill doesn’t allow insurance providers to deny coverage to someone based on pre-existing conditions outright. But with a waiver, states can allow providers to set premium costs based on an individual’s ""health status."" Even though the bill puts in some protections, health economists say this could make insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions. Before the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies were not transparent about what counts as a pre-existing condition, and the House Republican replacement doesn’t change that, said Kathryn Votava, president of health care consulting company Goodcare. This allows for the real possibility that sexual assault victims who seek medical treatment could face challenges in getting health insurance if the Republican bill becomes law, she said. ""Could"" is the key word. What ultimately happens depends on whether the bill is changed in the Senate and how states and insurance companies respond. The lack of transparency, as well as the potential for different policies from state to state, would put a significant burden on consumers trying to figure out whether they can obtain insurance given their health status, said Claire Brindis, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California San Francisco. For victims of sexual assault in particular, the bill could have a chilling effect, she added. Women might choose not to seek medical treatment after an assault because they are concerned it might affect their ability to get health insurance down the line. Sexual assault ""is the tip of the iceberg,"" Brindis said. ""There are many many other examples of unexpected events that occur in day to day life, that you can’t plan for, can’t avoid."" Our ruling Various bloggers wrote that under the House Republican health plan, sexual assault is a pre-existing condition. Several websites have since softened their headlines to be more careful, going from ""would"" to ""could."" The bill does not change what is or is not a pre-existing condition; the health insurance companies write those definitions for themselves. The House bill also does not single out sexual assault or any other medical issue as a pre-existing condition. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, some victims of sexual assault said they had trouble getting health insurance because they sought medical services that the insurance companies viewed as evidence of a pre-existing condition, such as for sexually transmitted illness or mental health. The Republican bill might make it harder for people who have pre-existing conditions to get affordable health care coverage. Victims of sexual assault would face the same challenge as others with pre-existing conditions. But we don’t know for sure given the bill’s current form.

Police smoke marijuana yearly to test potency, Alex Jones says
","Texas-based radio show host Alex Jones admitted during a child custody hearing that he has smoked cannabis, in violation of state law. But he only smoked it once per year, he reasoned — just like law enforcement does. Locked in a custody battle over his three children with his ex-wife, the conservative media personality made the admission during testimony in Austin, Texas, on April 20. That’s right, 4/20. Jones said that he tries marijuana annually to gauge its potency. He argued from the stand that he thought marijuana was too strong, a shortcoming he blamed on billionaire George Soros, a frequent scapegoat of conspiracy theorists. Why smoke cannabis annually? ""That’s what police do,"" Jones said, according to the Austin American-Statesman. ""They smoke it once a year, too."" Jones has admitted to smoking marijuana before, and notably sparked up on Joe Rogan’s podcast earlier this year. While marijuana is illegal in Texas, it is decriminalized in California, where Rogan’s show was recorded. PolitiFact has checked claims about marijuana potency before, the gist being that cannabis is as much as 800 percent stronger now than it was four decades ago. We attempted to contact Jones through his InfoWars website to suss out the basis of his claim that cops rolled their own, but did not receive a response. Jones may have been speaking anecdotally, with or without firsthand knowledge of stoner cops. Law enforcement agencies, however, suggested that Jones was just blowing smoke. Where there’s smoke In general, when people talk about marijuana’s potency, they mean the levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. That’s the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, which contains hundreds of chemical compounds. There’s plenty of research that shows THC levels have increased over the years. A 2010 study by researchers at the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi, for example, found that the THC concentrations had risen by about 171 percent in just a 16-year time period. That study used 46,000 samples of marijuana seized during law enforcement raids. But there was no indication that cops smoked the ganja to find out how strong it was. That’s a job for a laboratory. There are a couple of methods for measuring the chemical compounds in cannabis, but all of them take a certain level of scientific proficiency and technical equipment. Many states that have medical or recreational marijuana have labs that test for these compounds; one company in California has even developed testers for business use outside of a lab. But it’s not like you can take a few hits and spit out a THC percentage, the way Jones implied. We don’t know how he concocted his theory, or which police department he believed was letting officers light up, but we checked with a few places. The Texas Department of Public Safety said they did not have any specifics about departmental drug testing, either for seized evidence or for employees. The state does operate several crime labs that test drugs seized as evidence. The Texas Police Association also did not tell us any particular procedure used by law enforcement agencies. They only said that each department in the state would have its own policies and methods. Since Jones is in Austin, we went to the local P.D. to ask them if it’s possible cops spark up the local dank to get an idea of how strong the weed is there. In a word, no. Jennifer Herber, a spokeswoman for the Austin police department, pointed out that the department’s policy manual prohibited marijuana use. The department does not test cannabis, she said. On a federal level, Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Russ Bayer said the DEA operates its own labs to gauge potency and purity of all kinds of drugs, including marijuana. Depending on the case, the labs may test evidence from federal cases or helping local authorities. But agents toking up to give drugs a personal test? ""It’s laughable. Not plausible,"" Bayer said. ""Frankly, it’s insulting. The DEA would never allow consumption of any controlled substance."" Our ruling Defending his own use of marijuana, Jones said police officers ""smoke it once a year, too."" He didn’t offer any proof of his claim that cops light up joints annually to test the strength of cannabis, and we couldn’t find any. Perhaps Jones anecdotally knows or has heard of police officers who don't keep off the grass, but we didn't find a cop shop that said that was a policy. Law enforcement agencies generally test marijuana potency in a laboratory setting, and not by lighting up in the squad room (or elsewhere). For lack of evidence, we rate this statement False.",/factchecks/2017/may/05/alex-jones/police-smoke-marijuana-yearly-test-potency-alex-jo/

Villaraigosa’s Mostly True claim about the rise in school graduation rates
","Early in his campaign for California governor, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has repeatedly touted his accomplishments as an education reformer. At a candidates’ forum in Sacramento in late March, Villaraigosa had this to say about his involvement with the Los Angeles Unified School District: ""When I became mayor of Los Angeles, we had a 44 percent (high school) graduation rate. I said that was unacceptable. I challenged that notion. I said the mayor needs to be involved with our schools. We need to partner together. As I left, after a number of reforms, we grew our graduation rate from 44 percent to 72."" This wasn’t his first reference to graduation rates. Villaraigosa also cited it  in his campaign press release announcing his run for governor in November 2016. It’s safe to say he'll talk a lot about this between now and the 2018 election. We wanted to know whether the district’s graduation rate really had improved that much and whether Villaraigosa was directly involved in these gains. We set out on a fact check. First, some background Villaraigosa is among several prominent Democrats competing to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others include California Treasurer John Chiang; Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction; and Gavin Newsom, the state’s current lieutenant governor. Republican candidates include John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a former professional football player.  Tracking the Truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked? Email us at [email protected], tweet us @CAPolitiFact or contact us on Facebook. Villaraigosa was mayor of Los Angeles from July 2005 through July 2013. Soon after taking office, he made a failed bid to take control of the school district. His office did eventually, however, take over the administration of several of the district’s lowest performing schools. Now, the numbers Asked for evidence about the graduation rate numbers, Villaraigosa’s campaign spokeswoman Michelle Jeung cited two studies conducted in the mid 2000s, and detailed in news reports from the time, that found the district’s graduation rate hovering at about 44 percent. As reported by the LA Daily News in June 2006, ""Just 44 percent of Los Angeles Unified students receive a high school diploma, making the 727,000-student district's graduation rate among the lowest of large urban school districts,"" according to a national study by the nonpartisan publication Education Week. The report relied on enrollment data from the 2002-2003 school year, according to a Los Angeles Times article. Villaraigosa’s spokeswoman also cited a March 2005 Harvard University study, Confronting the Graduation Rate Crisis in California. It put the district’s graduation rate at 45.3 percent, based on enrollment data from the early 2000s. At the time, L.A. Unified officials strongly criticized the Education Week report, saying in the Daily News article that the district’s graduation rate, by that time, was ""closer to 64 percent."" The district’s chief instructional officer called the Education Week study ""horrifically flawed"" and ""unfair"" because of the methodology used, according to a Los Angeles Times article from the same year. They questioned the use of the data from 2002-2003 and said the school district had made graduation rate strides. District officials added that the studies did not take into account students who move during the year. ""We're making real gains in this. We're keeping kids in longer, but we're also getting more accurate information,"" LA Unified Superintendent Roy Romer said. Graduation rate as Villaraigosa left There’s less contention over the school district’s graduation rate at the end of Villaraigosa’s time as mayor. For the 2013-2014 school year, which immediately followed Villaraigosa’s final term, the district had a 70.2 percent graduation rate, according to California Department of Education data. The following two school years, the rate increased to 72.2 percent and then 77 percent. Peter Tira, a spokesman for the state Department of Education, noted there’s been a change in how graduation rates are calculated. Before the 2009-2010 school year, the state included students who had transferred to adult schools or been sent to juvenile hall when it calculated graduation rates. Tira said it no longer includes these and other categories of students. Villaraigosa’s role There’s disagreement over just how low the school district’s graduation rates were in the early-to-mid 2000s. But there’s little doubt Villaraigosa charged head-first into education reforms as mayor. Some informed observers of Los Angeles politics and education told us the former mayor does deserve credit for improvements at the school district, though they say it wasn’t his doing alone. One of them is Ben Austin, who served as deputy mayor under former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. He said Villaraigosa endorsed and helped elect a majority of the district’s school board. ""He exercised a tremendous amount of influence over the school board to the point of installing his own superintendent"" through the board, added Austin, who serves on an advisory board for Students Matter, a nonprofit that promotes access to quality public education. Austin said he supported Villaraigosa in his runs for mayor. Villaraigosa’s spokeswoman cited the former mayor’s creation in 2007 of the nonprofit Partnership for Los Angeles schools as one of his biggest education reforms. Through the Partnership, Villaraigosa took over 16 of the district’s worst-performing schools. Citing data released by the school district, the Partnership reported a 41 percent graduation rate increase at its schools from 2008 to 2015. During his time as mayor, Villaraigosa repeatedly clashed with the city’s teachers union over school reforms. In a statement, United Teachers Los Angeles Alex Caputo-Pearl said it was ""a stretch at best"" to say Villaraigosa was responsible for the district’s improved graduation rates. Dan Schnur is director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. He is a former Republican consultant. Schnur said he has no reason to dispute the graduation rate numbers cited by Villaraigosa. ""The question is: Who deserves the credit for that happening? (Villaraigosa) did prioritize the issue in his campaign and in his administration,"" Schnur said. ""The case can be made that his use of the bully pulpit (as mayor) was a contributing factor."" Schnur’s wife, Cecile Ablack, served as Villaraigosa's deputy mayor for communications. Experts told us much of the credit goes to the district’s students and the school board Villaraigosa helped form. ""He elected a (school board) majority of pretty bold reformers,"" Austin noted. Our ruling California gubernatorial candidate and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa recently claimed about the Los Angeles Unified School District: ""When I became mayor of Los Angeles, we had a 44 percent (high school) graduation rate. I said that was unacceptable. I challenged that notion. I said the mayor needs to be involved with our schools. We need to partner together. As I left, after a number of reforms, we grew our graduation rate from 44 percent to 72."" A 2006 study by the nonpartisan Education Week placed the district’s graduation rate at 44 percent, while a Harvard study the year before placed the rate at 45.3 percent. They both used enrollment data from the early 2000s. School district officials in 2006 disputed the findings, saying improvements had been made and the rate was closer to 64 percent. District data shows that rate had climbed to 70.2 percent immediately after Villaraigosa’s term ended. It rose to 72.2 percent and then 77 percent in the following two years. Several observers of Los Angeles politics and education said Villaraigosa doesn’t get all the credit but did play an outsized role. He helped elect a reform-minded school board, install a superintendent and created a nonprofit that took control of and helped improve the district’s worst performing schools. The dispute over the district’s view of its graduation rate is missing from Villaraigosa’s statement. As is the fact that the studies used data from the early 2000s, a few years before Villaraigosa took office. But there’s certainly evidence to back up the former mayor’s claim about graduation rate improvements and his influence. In the end, we rate Villaraigosa’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

Super PAC attack blaming Tammy Baldwin for deaths of 3 veterans at Tomah VA hospital lacks evidence
","When seeking re-election in 2018, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin could be vulnerable to criticism of how she responded to an opioid painkiller scandal at the Tomah VA Medical Center in western Wisconsin. But an attack ad from Americas PAC that began airing April 27, 2017 claims Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about ""overmedicated veterans"" at Tomah and made ""deadly mistakes"" that left three veterans dead. The first-term Wisconsin Democrat has said her office made mistakes in handling a key inspection report about the Tomah VA and emails from a whistleblower. But that’s different than making mistakes that were deadly to three veterans. One death occurred years after the veteran ended his treatment at the Tomah VA and another had nothing to do with overmedication. As for the third veteran, Jason Simcakoski, Baldwin had requested investigations into the Tomah prescription practices before Simcakoski overdosed at the facility. And although Baldwin was slow to respond to emails from a whistleblower, those emails weren’t received until after Simakoski’s death. The ad Americas PAC is an Iowa-based super PAC that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for or against political candidates. It is largely funded by Republican Richard Uihlein, co-founder of Uline, a Wisconsin shipping and packaging supplies distributor. Another Uihlein-supported super PAC, also eyeing 2018, previously attacked Baldwin with a claim we rated Mostly False about funding U.S. military troops. As for the Americas PAC attack, we’re presenting the entire script of its radio ad to show how sound bites, spliced with narration, connect Baldwin to the the deaths.    Newscast audio: New developments tonight in a Wisconsin VA hospital investigation. Senator Tammy Baldwin -- Newscast audio: -- and investigating claims of a cover-up involving one Senate Democrat. Narrator: A whistleblower went to Democrat Sen. Tammy Baldwin for help protecting disabled veterans. Newscast audio: Senator Tammy Baldwin learned of the allegations that the patients were being overmedicated. Narrator: And Tammy Baldwin was slow to take action. Talk show audio: -- critical of Senator Baldwin of having a delayed reaction to the March report. Narrator: When disabled veterans were counting on her, Tammy Baldwin blinked. Interviewer audio: Did your office drop the ball? Baldwin audio clip: Mistakes were made. Narrator: Deadly mistakes. Three disabled veterans died. Newscast audio: -- after the deaths of three patients at a VA hospital. Narrator: When facing security challenges from Russia, China and ISIS, will Tammy Baldwin make another mistake? Now let's look at the three deaths. Two of the deaths The Tomah VA and how politicians responded to problems there have been in the news since January 2015, when the California-based Center for Investigative Reporting exposed the overprescription of opioid drugs by the facility. The day after the Baldwin attack ad began airing, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that two Wisconsin radio stations had pulled the ad after lawyers for Baldwin’s campaign complained it was false. Tom Donelson of Americas PAC told the Journal Sentinel and us that the committee stands by the ad. But two of the three deaths clearly don’t support the attack on Baldwin: Jacob Ward had been heavily medicated at the Tomah VA and later became a drug addict. But his parents said his care at Tomah ended in 2007 and they transferred him to the Milwaukee VA in 2008 and that they didn’t blame the Tomah VA for his death. Ward, who was 27, overdosed on heroin and cocaine in a Milwaukee apartment on Sept. 4, 2013. That was six years after he stopped going to Tomah and a year before the whistleblower contacted Baldwin. Thomas Patrick Baer, 74, died Jan. 14, 2015 at a hospital in La Crosse, Wis., two days after he suffered two strokes at the Tomah VA while waiting for treatment there. His death was not connected to overmedication. That leaves Simcakoski, who suffered a fatal drug overdose in the psychiatric ward of the Tomah VA. He had been prescribed 15 drugs, including muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, antipsychotic medicines and an opioid painkiller. Let’s look at a timeline of his case and how it relates to Baldwin, based primarily on Gannett Wisconsin Media news reports. Jason Simcakoski Between April and June of 2014, Baldwin wrote letters to the Tomah VA director, a VA official in Washington and the VA inspector general in Washington. She asked each of them to investigate allegations that ""a large percentage of veterans"" at the Tomah VA were being treated for abuse of opioids and other drugs that had originally been prescribed by the facility -- and that continued to be prescribed to them. The allegations were made by a constituent who wanted to remain anonymous, according to the letters. That means Baldwin had taken those steps months before the Simcakoski’s death, which occurred on Aug. 30, 2014. Moreover, Ryan Honl, the whistleblower alluded to in the radio ad, didn’t make a complaint to Baldwin’s office until nearly a month later. Baldwin nevertheless has been criticized because she took no action between Aug. 29, 2014 -- the day before Simcakoski’s death, when her office received an inspection report documenting the overprescribing of opioids at Tomah -- and January 2015, when the Center for Investigative Reporting revealed the circumstances of his death and Baldwin called for an investigation. In between, Honl had repeatedly emailed Baldwin’s office asking that Baldwin call for an investigation and make the inspection report public. Baldwin later said she was disciplining her chief of staff and two other aides for failing to take appropriate action on complaints about Tomah. And she said her office made mistakes in handling the inspection report and the whistleblower’s pleas. Still, Baldwin didn’t receive the inspection report until the day before Simcakoski’s death and the whistleblower didn’t begin contacting her until after Simcakoski’s death. Our rating Americas PAC says Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about ""overmedicated veterans,"" she made ""deadly mistakes"" and ""three veterans died"" at the Tomah VA hospital. Baldwin has acknowledged mistakes in the handling of an inspection report and a whistle blower’s emails about veterans being over prescribed opioid painkillers at Tomah. But none of those tie Baldwin to the deaths. One death had nothing to do with overmedication. One was an overdose, but it occurred in Milwaukee years after the veteran stopped being treated in Tomah and before the whistleblower contacted Baldwin. And the third death, though an overdose at the Tomah VA, also occurred before the whistleblower contacted Baldwin (and only one day after she received the inspection report). We rate the statement False.   Related fact check: The attack on Baldwin is along the lines of one made against Democrat Russ Feingold, who ran unsuccessfully against Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in 2016. A super PAC claimed that when Feingold was in the Senate, he received a memo in 2009 that ""outlined veteran harm"" at the Tomah VA ""and nothing was done.""

Trump says recent CNN poll shows him competitive in contest with Obama
","
At an April 27, 2011, news conference in Portsmouth, N.H., businessman and possible Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump boasted about how good a candidate he would be against President Barack Obama.

In a news conference that followed the White House’s release of Obama’s original birth certificate -- after Trump for weeks had publicly raised questions about whether Obama was actually born in Hawaii -- Trump said, ""I think, if I do run, I'll do very well. And I think -- look, I'm already leading the polls, and I'm not running. ... CNN did a poll recently where Obama and I are statistically tied. If you would like, I can send it to you. Just call up CNN.""

There was no need to call up CNN. The network quickly posted a story headlined, ""Trump cites CNN poll, but CNN didn't conduct such a poll.""

The authors of the CNN article said that Trump may have been referring to a Newsweek/Daily Beast poll from February -- more than two months ago.

According to CNN, the national survey by Newsweek/Daily Beast ""indicated that in a hypothetical general election matchup between President Barack Obama and Trump as the GOP nominee, Obama beat Trump by only two percentage points, 43 to 41, which was well with in the survey's sampling error.""

More recent polls tell a different story, however, suggesting that the results from Newsweek/Daily Beast head-to-head matchup between Obama and Trump are either outdated, an outlier or both.

The website RealClearPolitics, which tracks most political polling, offers six such head-to-head matchups, with an average margin of more than 13 points in Obama’s favor. Here’s the rundown:

•  ABC News/Washington Post (April 14-17): Obama 52, Trump 40
•  McClatchy/Marist (April 10-14): Obama 54, Trump 38
•  Rasmussen Reports (April 15-16): Obama 49, Trump 34
•  FOX News (April 3-5): Obama 52, Trump 34
•  Newsweek/Daily Beast (Feb. 12-15) Obama 43, Trump 41
•  Public Policy Polling (Feb. 11-14), Obama 48, Trump 34

A couple of notes: Rasmussen and Public Policy Polling use automated-dialing methods, which many polling experts consider less reliable than polls conducted by human operators. In addition, Rasmussen is widely considered Republican-leaning while PPP is a Democratic firm. The other four firms that asked the question are independent polls sponsored by media organizations and which use traditional polling methodology.

In addition, the two earliest polls -- including the Newsweek/Daily Beast poll -- were conducted before Trump became closely identified with the birth certificate issue. On Feb. 10, 2011, Trump for the first time used a high-profile venue to publicly question Obama’s background, when he told attendees of the conservative CPAC conference that ""the people that went to school with (Obama), they never saw him, they don't know who he is."" (Four days later, PolitiFact gave the statement a Pants on Fire rating.)

After Trump began broadcasting his views on Obama’s birth certificate in a series of nationally televised interviews, his head-to-head numbers against Obama worsened. His average for the four polls conducted in April produced an average Obama lead of more than 15 points.

So, Trump not only gave an incorrect attribution for the poll that showed him within the margin of error, but he also ignored or didn't know about more recent polls that suggest he would not do well in a head-to-head contest against Obama. We also think it’s misleading of Trump to characterize the poll as ""recent."" In another context, he might have an argument that it’s ""recent,"" but in a dynamic, fast-changing primary contest, two months is the equivalent of a geological eon. The fact is, the most recent four polls show Trump losing to Obama by near-landslide proportions.

Mike Haridopolos says many states, but not Florida, are deficit spending
","
After some bumps and squabbling, Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos and House Speaker Dean Cannon emerged from secret budget negotiations on April 26, 2011, to announce that they had reached the framework of a budget agreement.

The framework is just that -- the amounts of general revenue funding allocated to each budget area. The Senate and House must still agree on how, exactly, to spend that money.

Still, it was cause for celebration for both Haridopolos and Cannon, who issued a joint press release.

""Resolving a budget shortfall of nearly $4 billion is a tall order, but I'm pleased the House and Senate worked through this difficult process,"" Cannon said. ""Our allocations ensure that we preserve our bond ratings by maintaining adequate reserves. Most importantly, we do not take money out of the struggling Florida economy by increasing taxes or fees.""

Added Haridopolos: ""While many states and the federal government are floundering under crushing deficit spending, we kept our promise that we would not raise taxes or fees during these difficult economic times. For months, I've heard over and over again that we would never be able to get this done. Working as a team, the House and Senate reached these budget allocations on behalf of all Floridians.""

What struck us in the two statements is Haridopolos' claim that governments at the state and federal level are ""floundering under crushing deficit spending."" We know that the federal government is spending more money than it takes in, meaning it's borrowing money to keep the government running. But we wondered whether other states were in the same fiscal predicament.

Make no mistake, states are in a financial pinch.

According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, nearly every state is proposing spending less, after adjusting for inflation, than it did in 2008 when the recession began. The center, which is considered Democratic-leaning, said at least 25 states have proposed health care cuts. At least 21 states are proposing significant cuts to K-12 public education, another 20 states are proposing cuts to higher education, and at least 15 states have proposed government work layoffs and/or benefit cuts for state workers. For the record, only 48 states are proposing budgets this year. Kentucky and Wyoming operate on two-year budget cycles. 
But are states running deficits? 
Not really, said two experts we asked -- Jon Shure of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Ron Snell with the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
Forty-nine of 50 states are required to pass balanced budgets every year, Shure said. States ""might borrow for capital improvements and the like, but not for their operating budgets,"" Shure said. ""Vermont is the exception. It has no balanced budget requirement but has still chosen not to borrow for operating expenses."" 
Snell added that Illinois and California can roll forward unpaid bills for one year, but then are required to pay off those debts in the next year. But they are not allowed to carry deficits for multiple years. 
""States have a requirement to balance their operating budgets,"" said Snell, whose group says, like Shure’s, that only Vermont is not required to pass balanced budgets. 
Shure said that because of the financial crisis, every state has had to make cuts, most have used reserves, and more than 30 states also have created additional revenues by increasing either some fees or taxes.

Florida has taken a cuts-only approach, Shure said. (Though he noted that the state did raise a host of fees in 2009, and also has raised tuition rates for Florida universities.) Of the $70 billion state budget passed last year, $2.2 billion is directed to pay debt service for capital projects, according to John Kuczwanski, communications manager at the State Board of Administration.

Haridopolos spokesman David Bishop said Haridopolos was trying to note that many states chose to raise taxes, while Florida did not.

""The wording was meant to infer that states are facing tough economic decision(s) and have deficits when compared to last year's (current year) budget,"" Bishop said. ""Many states like California and Illinois have chosen to raise taxes.""

Here's what Haridopolos said, in praising the framework of Florida's 2011-12 budget: ""While many states and the federal government are floundering under crushing deficit spending, we kept our promise that we would not raise taxes or fees during these difficult economic times."" Haridopolos might have been trying to say that many states raised taxes to balance their budget, but we're sticking to his actual words.

Vermont is the only state -- either by statute or constitution -- that can run deficit budgets like the federal government. But it's chosen to balance its budget. All other states are required to pass balanced budgets. We rate Haridopolos' claim False.

President Barack Obama says Rep. Paul Ryan voted for wars, tax cuts and a drug bill that weren’t paid for
","
In closed-door remarks to campaign supporters on April 14, 2011, President Barack Obama looked back in frustration at lengthy negotiations with Republicans over funding to keep the federal government operating.

Obama opined, as a CBS News online story reported, that he expects Republicans to continue using the budget process to ""enact their political agenda under the guise of cutting spending.""

The president singled out U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the House Budget Committee chairman who has authored a long-term deficit-reduction plan.

""When Paul Ryan says his priority is to make sure, you know, he's just being America's accountant, trying to be responsible ...This is the same guy who voted for two wars that were unpaid for, voted for the Bush tax cuts that were unpaid for, voted for the prescription drug bill that cost as much as my health care bill -- but wasn't paid for,"" Obama told his supporters. ""So it's not on the level.""

In making the remark, Obama pointed to several big-ticket items approved during the Bush administration while Ryan was in Congress -- ones he says have helped drive the nation’s record deficits.

Given the prominence of the protagonists and the timeliness of the comments, we decided to take a look at Obama’s critique of Ryan.

With the words, Obama is offering an opinion about how Ryan has framed his budget-cutting efforts. We can’t fact-check the president’s opinion about Ryan’s message. But we can focus on the factual assertions, and try to put them into some context.

We started with the White House, which declined to comment, saying the president’s remarks spoke for themselves.

Let’s look at the votes.

There is no dispute Ryan voted for Afghanistan and Iraq war funding; for the major tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 (and extended in 2010); and for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit created in 2003.

All were big-ticket items.

But Obama goes a step further to assert that all were ""unpaid for."" That’s Washington parlance for bills not offset by corresponding spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere in the federal budget.

Budget experts we consulted and the historical record confirm there were no direct offsets built into those bills.

Obama’s claim on the prescription drug bill was slightly different -- that it wasn’t paid for and ""cost as much as my health care bill.""

Let’s break this into two parts.

Obama appears to refer to the gross outlays needed for the two landmark bills.

For the Medicare prescription drug bill, passed in 2003 and effective in 2006, we found a range of cost estimates for 10 years: $395 billion to $720 billion. The official Congressional Budget Office estimate was the low end.

That was at the time. Now, government estimates show the original cost projections were too high, perhaps by as much as 40 percent, said Jon Gabel, senior fellow in health care research at the National Opinion Research Center.

Obama’s health reform bill -- the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- was pricier, with estimates in the $800 billion to $1.4 trillion range.  Ryan and Republicans opposed the bill.

But the two measures were passed seven years apart, so inflation may be a factor.

Paul Van de Water, a former Congressional Budget Office official who is now a senior fellow with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, did an inflation-adjusted comparison and found the Medicare bill is probably two-thirds or three-quarters the cost of the Obama health care measure.

That is, Obama’s health care bill is still hundreds of millions of dollars more costly than the Medicare drug bill.

So the president was off in equating the gross cost of the bills.

On the offset question, the Medicare prescription drug bill, however, indisputably added to the federal deficit. It was not offset by new revenue or other spending cuts.

In contrast, the official government estimate of the 2010 health care law’s impact said it would actually reduce the deficit, in part because of the new taxes it enacts to help offset the cost of expanding health coverage.

The source for that is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

The CBO’s estimate is hardly undisputed -- Ryan, other Republican leaders and various budget analysts have argued that the CBO’s report was skewed by questionable assumptions given to it by the Obama administration. They contend the law would actually add to the deficit.

Nevertheless, we -- and Congress -- have used CBO estimates as the gold standard on such matters. So Obama has a pretty firm leg to stand on in saying his health bill was paid for while the Medicare bill was not.

That covers the details behind the president’s remarks. In this case, it’s important to put them into their proper context. We consulted several experts and sought Ryan’s take.

Ryan was asked in a recent interview about Obama’s citing the Medicare drug program, the two wars and the Bush tax cuts as major drivers of the deficit.

He disagreed: ""We still had these enormous, building, unfunded liabilities, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security -- I mean, the big drivers of our debt.""

His office sent us a defense of his votes on war funding, quoting his budget plan: ""Like all categories of government spending, defense spending should be executed with greater efficiency and accountability. But responsible budgeting must never lose sight of the fact that the first responsibility of the federal government is to provide for the defense of the nation.""

On the Bush tax cuts, Ryan aides said the congressman believes that ""we have deficits because Washington spends too much, not because Americans are taxed too little."" He says the tax cuts helped fuel economic growth and bring in more tax revenue.

Indeed, in December, Obama himself backed a compromise with Republicans, including Ryan, that extended the Bush tax cuts.

""Bottom line: Ryan has voted for massive new spending and so has the president,"" said Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.

Iraq war costs have topped $1 trillion, said Scott Lilly, former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee and now a research fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Neither Bush’s war effort in Afghanistan nor Obama’s escalation there has been paid for, both analysts noted.

In April, both Obama and Ryan unveiled long-term deficit reduction plans in the neighborhood of $4 trillion over a decade or more.

So where does this leave us?

The president cherry-picked a handful of votes in an effort to show that Ryan is not pristine on the subject of the deficit.

Obama got it right on Ryan’s support for the big-ticket bills, including war funding, Medicare prescription drugs and the Bush tax cuts. He was also on target in saying that none was offset or ""paid for"" by spending cuts or tax increases. That’s the main part of his claim.

He was off the mark in asserting that one of the bills -- Medicare prescription drugs -- was as costly as his 2010 health care reform bill.

That puts him at Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/27/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-rep-paul-ryan-voted-wa/

Luck runs out for student on lottery claim
","
With the cost of higher education rising every year, some students probably think they need to win the lottery to afford tuition.

But others -- math majors probably -- believe there’s a more likely way for the Georgia Lottery Corp. to help students pay their bills. Student organizations along with some state lawmakers have called on the corporation, the quasi-governmental entity that runs the game, to provide a higher percentage of its proceeds to the HOPE scholarship fund.

Last month Georgia Students for Public Higher Education, a group that has participated in public protests related to a variety of issues, and other student organizations criticized elected officials and the Geogia Lottery Corp. at a rally in downtown Atlanta in response to cuts in the HOPE scholarship program.

Allie McCullen, a statewide organizer with Georgia Students for Public Higher Education and a senior at the University of Georgia, said in a speech: ""The Georgia Lottery Corp. has only once in the past 16 years paid out the agreed upon 35 percent of proceeds to the account which funds the HOPE scholarship.""

Not a single PolitiFact scribe has yet to retire on a big-ticket prize. So we decided that in the meantime we’d look into whether the odds of the Georgia Lottery Corp. paying the agreed upon percentage to the HOPE scholarship are better than the 1 in 175 million odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot.

McCullen said she obtained the figure from an article published in February in the University of Georgia’s student newspaper The Red and Black, a publication she has been quoted in several times this year.

The Georgia Lottery Corp.’s numbers show the lottery provided 36.1 percent of its revenue toward education in 1995, 35 percent in 1996 and 35 percent in 1997.

But McCullen, who has also been quoted in The New York Times, points to the steadily declining percentage of revenue going toward education as proof that the theme of her speech still stands.

Since 1997 the percentage of revenue declined from 35 percent to a low of 25.6 percent in 2009. And the lottery has not provided 30 percent of its revenue to the education fund since 2004.

""I do recognize I had incorrect information, but since 1997 we have not seen a return to the 35 percent,"" she said. ""I think the opinion I expressed remains the same.""

Also in dispute, however, is what percentage of revenue the lottery is required to provide the scholarship fund.

The statute states that net proceeds of the lottery should be 35 percent of gross revenue ""as nearly as practical.""

The Georgia Lottery Corp. said in a statement to PolitiFact that the phrase was added to the statute to allow the lottery to be flexible and maximize its revenue.

If the organization was legally required to provide 35 percent, it could not provide large enough cash prizes to entice those looking for a lucky day, the corporation said.

""In fiscal year 1997, the Georgia Lottery returned 35 percent of lottery revenues to the state for lottery-funded educational programs in the amount of $581 million,"" the corporation said in a written statement. ""In FY10, the Georgia Lottery raised a record $883.9 million for HOPE and Pre-K, accounting for 26.1 percent of lottery revenues. Undoubtedly, more Georgia students benefited from the larger dollar amount, not the larger percentage.""

The dollar amount in 2010 is more, but the Georga Lottery Corp. did not make a straight comparison. In 2010 dollars the $581 million in 1997 would be the equivalent of $789 million.

But some elected officials do not believe the 35 percent number included in the legislation is meaningless.

Rep. Stacey Evans, D-Smyrna, said the intent of the legislation was to ensure the lottery comes close to 35 percent. She said that intent is not respected today.

""I’m not sure they’re even trying anymore,"" she said. ""We need more oversight of them and need them to come close to that 35 percent.""

If McCullen had said the Georgia Lottery Corp. has not hit its target of 35 percent since 1997, the accuracy of her statement would have hinged on what ""as nearly as practical"" means and why the legislation even included the number 35 percent. The legislators who PolitiFact spoke with agreed that the number was included for a reason and the corporation has not come close to reaching that target in recent years.

But, alas, McCullen said that in the past 16 years the Georgia Lottery Corp. met the 35 percent goal only once, but it has met the target three times. So she has a better chance of winning the lottery than receiving a True on the Truth-O-Meter.

We rate her statement False.",/factchecks/2011/apr/27/allie-mccullen/luck-runs-out-student-lottery-claim/

State Rep. Cheryl Grossman says GOP saved the state $250,000 with cuts to standing committees
","
Republicans, who control the Ohio House, called a news conference April 12 to pat themselves on the back for the work they had done the first 100 days of their two year stretch in the 129th General Assembly.

The group, led by Speaker William G. Batchelder, is quite proud of some of its early accomplishments.

A particular claim that state Rep. Cheryl Grossman, a Republican from Grove City near Columbus, made when it was her turn at the podium resonated most with Politifact Ohio.

""As far as standing committees, we have 10 fewer standing committees. So we’ve saved the state about a quarter-of-a-million dollars ($250,000) through the reduction of the standing committees."" said Grossman, a former Grove City mayor.

At a time when Ohio’s economy is still struggling to recover from a devastating national recession in recent years which helped blow an $8 billion deficit in the state’s budget, any amount of savings is a good thing. So PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Grossman’s figures.

We called the House Republican caucus (basically, Batchelder’s office) for an explanation and information to back up Grossman’s comments. The caucus said it verified its numbers through the House clerk’s office, which is considered independent but is run by a Republican appointed by Batchelder. (The speaker always gets to appoint the clerk and usually it is someone from the same political party.)

To start with, Batchelder eliminated 10 standing committees that existed during the 128th General Assembly under House Speaker Armond Budish, a Democrat. That dropped the number of standing committees from 27 to 17.

Above their standard annual pay, stipends are paid to leaders of the each committee: $6,500 for the chairman and $5,000 each to the vice-chairman and ranking minority member for a total of $16,500 in extra pay each year per committee.

Multiply that by 10, the number of committees eliminated, and you come away with $165,000 in annual savings. Grossman didn’t say it, but can we give her the benefit of the doubt? She meant in each year of the biennium considering lawmakers salaries are paid on an annual schedule.

So, that $165,000 over two years becomes $330,000 in savings, and that is not including the additional cost for benefits for lawmakers who receive the stipends.

But Batchelder did add three new standing sub-committees that did not exist under Budish in the previous two years. The sub-committee chair gets $5,000 and ranking minority member $2,500 (there is no vice chairman for these committees) totaling $7,500 per subcommittee. By adding three sub-committees Batchelder created a new line of expense totaling $22,000 a year in extra pay for lawmakers, not including benefits.

Subtract that from the savings generated from the elimination of sub-committees and House Republicans still save the state about $286,000.

But hold on.

While state representatives can serve in a leadership role on more than one committee they can only be paid one stipend. There were seven Democrats who pulled double duty under Budish, meaning they served as a chair or vice chair on more than one committee, but they were only paid one stipend, says House minority caucus spokesman Keary McCarthy.

Michael Dittoe, a spokesman for House majority caucus, provided the math in an e-mail. The savings on stipend payments, when the unused stipends are removed, amounts to $217,000, he said. Adding in savings from retirement costs  and administrative costs that aren't incurred raises that about 17 percent to just under $254,000. 
So it seems Grossman was right on the money as far as the dollars and cents in her claim. 
But wait, there’s more.

Grossman says the House Republicans are ""saving"" the state money. That’s an attractive claim in the middle of budget season. Gov. John Kasich last month proposed a $55 billion, two year spending proposal that closes the deficit. The House is currently reviewing the proposal.

According to an analysis of the House of Representatives budget proposal, Batchelder’s leadership team is requesting the same appropriation in each of the next two years as the House is spending in the current year, just shy of $20 million per year.

""I’m not sure how one can claim savings when they are spending the exact same amount,"" said the Democrats McCarthy.

Politifact Ohio followed up with Dittoe. Preparing the House budget request involved use of cost projections made prior to the new General Assembly being sworn into office. Those projections anticipate increased costs, particularly for health care benefits, that prompted the House to recommend a spending plan that could cover some ""worst case scenarios,"" he said in an e-mail. 
He notes, though, that while the projections suggest healthcare costs could rise nearly $500,000 for just the members of the General Assembly, the requested budget was flat. The hope is that  cuts elsewhere will cover those increases, if they come to pass. And, he added, that the exact funding level for the House won't be known until the budget is passed. 
So where does that leave us? 
There is an element of truth in Grossman’s claim: there are 10 fewer standing committees and the amount paid for leadership stipends will be less.

But the bigger point she made that day while standing before a throng of media, including television cameras, was that Republicans are saving Ohio $250,000.

Where’s the savings?

Republicans may have cut spending in one area -- committee costs -- but the budget request for House operations is at the same level, which means that money was redirected to be spent elsewhere. And Dittoe cited one area in particular - health costs. 
That’s a critical fact that would give the listener a different impression of Grossman’s claim -- that characterizing the committee changes as a savings to the state of Ohio is misleading.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Grossman’s statement as Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/27/cheryl-grossman/state-rep-cheryl-grossman-says-gop-cuts-standing-c/

Sen. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla claims only 2 to 3 voters a day reported at some Miami-Dade early voting sites
","
From the state that brought you the infamous 2000 presidential election recount comes talk of once again tweaking the state's election process.

State lawmakers are mulling SB 2086, an omnibus bill packed with different election-related proposals, one of which seeks to reduce the number of weeks allowed for early voting from two weeks to one. Republicans laud the measure as an efficiency move, while Democrats say the bill could disenfranchise voters.

State Sen. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, a Miami Republican, listed his reasons for supporting the measure during an April 15, 2011, Senate Rules Committee meeting.

""Generally, early voting in Miami-Dade County has not been very efficient,"" Diaz de la Portilla said, as reported by the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald Tallahassee Bureau. ""What you see more often than not is that there is a trickle of two or three people a day at a very high cost to keep those public libraries and polls open. … We felt it was an efficiency measure.""

We wondered if Diaz de la Portilla's low turnout number is correct for people trickling in to Miami-Dade's 20 early voting sites.

First, some background on early voting. It became an option for Florida voters in 2004, in response to the flawed 2000 presidential election. Lawmakers vowed to leave as little room for error as possible after that vote, where voters complained about complicated ballots and being turned away from overcrowded voting locations.

In Miami-Dade, there are 1,205,770 voters registered for the 2010 general election in November (including 368,221 Republicans and 532,095 Democrats). Of all those, 97,076 voted early on the Nov. 2 ballot that included the U.S. Senate race, governor, state cabinet and constitutional amendments.

We called Diaz de la Portilla's Tallahassee office seeking comment from the senator, but did not hear back. However, we did get a response from the Miami-Dade Elections Department when we asked about early voting statistics.

The elections department provided us with early voting tallies from seven recent elections. They were the 2006 primary and general elections; the 2008 presidential primary, regular primary and general elections; and the 2010 primary and general elections. You can find them all here. While some sites are busier than others, we could only find two cases where the number of voters on a particular day fell to single digits -- and that was likely because of Tropical Storm Ernesto, not because of inefficiencies.

On Aug. 29, 2006, early voting was suspended for a day as the storm passed through South Florida. And on Aug. 30, only eight people showed up to vote at Florida City City Hall and five at Miami City Hall. Each of the other sites also had low numbers that day, probably a result of weather distractions.

For other dates over those seven elections, daily voting tallies at different sites ranged from 13 to 3,324. Most recently, in the Nov. 2 election, the lowest turnout was 80 voters, recorded at the Lemon City Library on Oct. 23. For all 20 sites over the 14-day early voting period, an average of 117 votes were cast in the 2010 primary and 346 votes in the 2010 general election.

If fact, as each election cycle has gone by, the number of voters casting early votes has increased.

For example, during the 2006 general election, 66,192 voters cast their ballot at an early voting site to decide between then-Republican Charlie Crist and Democrat Jim Davis for governor. That number swelled to 326,492 early votes cast during the 2008 presidential election when Democratic Sen. Barack Obama defeated Republican Sen. John McCain. Granted, presidential elections usually draw a bigger turnout, but even during the 2010 Senate and gubernatorial election, 97,076 voters headed to early voting sites -- a 47 percent increase from the 2006 election.

""A lot of it has to do with the outreach we’re doing in the community, and people being more aware as each year goes by that early voting is an option,"" said Miami Dade Elections spokeswoman Christina White.

It costs Miami-Dade County approximately $2,000 a day, per site, to conduct early voting, White said. For 20 sites over 14 days, that's $560,000.

When asked whether Diaz de la Portilla’s figures of two to three voters a day trickling into sites seemed accurate, White said: ""I think the spreadsheets speak for themselves.""

During the 2008 presidential election, early voting sites were so packed that voters usually waited in lines that circled the libraries and city halls where early voting is held.

""Voters waited more than four hours to get their ballot counted at the Aventura Government Center,"" according to a Nov. 3, 2008, Miami Herald article detailing the long waits.

The lines and wait times at some Miami-Dade early voting sites were so long that the elections department eventually created a link on its website updating wait times at each site.

""At 3 p.m. at the Miami-Dade government center, the line was hundreds strong winding its way through the outdoor plaza,"" according to a Nov. 2, 2008, Miami Herald article. ""Large golf umbrellas poked out of the crowd, first steeling people from the rain and then the sun. Some people in line checked the wait times from PDAs.

''I think we'll go to Aventura,'' voter Craig Hooten, 41, told a Miami Herald reporter on that date, after noting an hour and 45-minute line at the Aventura City Hall early voting site.

While there have been cases of early voter turnout falling below the double-digit mark, those instances were related to inclement weather. Overall, early voting in Miami-Dade County has experienced steady growth each election cycle, with some sites processing more than 3,000 voters.

Mickey Mouse was registered to vote in Florida, Republican House member claims
","
A bill that would make major changes to state election law passed the Florida House 79-37 on April 21, 2011, but not before Republicans and Democrats argued over the intent of the 157-page bill.

Democrats say the bill is an attempt to suppress the votes of minorities, women and young people -- in part because the bill eliminates a four-decades-old provision that allows voters who have moved or changed their last name to update their information at the polls on Election Day. Those voters would have to file provisional ballots that are reviewed after the election under the proposed law.

Another sticking point with Democrats is that the bill requires third-party groups like the League of Women Voters to register with the state and to turn in signed voter registration forms within 48 hours instead of the current 10 days.

But Republicans say the changes are to protect the state against possible voter fraud.

""This is a great country. Our vote is precious, and we're going to protect it,"" said Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, sponsor of the bill, HB 1355. During the floor debate, Rep. Eric Eisnaugle, R-Orlando, more directly rebuffed the suggestion from Democrats that the legislation isn't needed and noted several instances of fraud.

(You can watch Eisnaugle's comments by clicking here. He starts speaking about two hours and 28 minutes in.)

""One of my colleagues suggested that we spent hours of time on a problem that doesn't exist, also suggesting that nothing in this bill helps people vote,"" he said. ""Well, members, it doesn't take much to find the documentation of fraud that some third-party registration organizations have committed right here in Florida. Just go on Google, and go to the news section and you can find a pretty long list of articles documenting the fraud we have seen. We have seen allegations of fraud, (Florida Department of Law Enforcement) investigations. (We have seen) falsifying of hundreds of registrations, including the registration of an actor who was already deceased at the time. In another case, Mickey Mouse was registered to vote.

""In yet another case, hundreds or thousands ... of students were registered to vote without their knowledge after they simply signed a petition, having no idea that their information was then going to be turned around and used to register their names on the voter rolls here in Florida.

""If we don't take action to put an end to the fraud, our vote doesn't matter as much,"" Eisnaugle said.

Eisnaugle made three different fraud claims, and we plan to touch on each in this fact check to see if they're true. But for the sake of the Truth-O-Meter, we're going to home in on the line that stuck out because of the absurdity of it, if true: ""Mickey Mouse was registered to vote.""

Registered dead actor

Eisnaugle said one case of fraud included the falsifying of hundreds of voter registrations, and the registration of an already dead actor.

This story comes from South Florida before the 2008 presidential election and involves the now-defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- or ACORN. Eleven people hired by ACORN to register potential voters near Homestead were accused of falsifying hundreds of voter registration applications.

In this instance, it was ACORN who turned in the hired workers. ACORN officials noticed the discrepancies in the cards turned in by the suspects and contacted authorities. The group workers turned in 1,400 cards, of which 888 were found to be fraudulent. Included among the fraudulent voter applications -- deceased actor Paul Newman. Workers also filled out a voter application for singer James Taylor or filled out several cards for the same real voter, the Miami Herald reported after the fraud was made public on Sept. 9, 2009.

Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle praised ACORN for assisting authorities, and told Fox News that no one voted in the election using the fraudulent voter applications.

""We've been very aggressive about a lot of these cases,"" Fernandez Rundle said. ""But we would not have known about these workers unless ACORN brought it to us.

""It's really minor, ineffectual attempts (by the hired workers) to justify getting paid an hourly basis. It could not have impacted the voting process whatsoever. Nonetheless, we cannot turn a blind eye to this.''

Students duped

The story of the students thinking they were signing petitions -- only instead to be registered to vote -- comes from the 2004 presidential election.

In October 2004, the St. Petersburg Times published a story talking about instances on campuses across the state where students were unwittingly either being registered to vote, or were being signed up to vote as Republicans when they wanted to be registered as something else.

The Times quoted officials at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement who said that 4,000 students may have fallen for the trick. The likely suspect, the Times reported, was a group hired by the National Republican Committee to register voters.

The workers would have the students sign a petition to legalize marijuana or a petition urging stiffer sentences for child abusers. Then, workers would have students unknowingly fill out a second form registering them to vote as Republicans.

Mindy Tucker Fletcher, a senior adviser to the Florida GOP, told the Times that it doesn't help the party to register Democrats as Republicans if they didn't then vote to re-elect George W. Bush.

In 2008, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement also investigated the stories of two Orlando-area teens who received voter registration cards in the mail even though they were too young to vote. The girls said they filled out entry forms to win a riding lawn mower while at the mall, and that they think someone used their information to forge or create voter applications. The voter applications were stamped with ACORN symbols. 
Mickey Mouse

Then there's Mickey Mouse, the cartoon face of the Disney empire, and apparently a Florida registered voter. (Take that, California!)

It turns out Mickey did fill out a voter registration application in Orange County ahead of the 2008 presidential election. Mickey checked the box indicating that he was updating his voter registration information and was changing his name.

According to the application, Mickey appears to have listed a birth date of Jan. 15, 2002, the address of ""15 Ave 17 0922"" in Orlando, and a zip code, 56812, that isn't on file with the United States Postal Service.

The phone number -- with a 407 area code -- was disconnected when we called on April 22.

Mickey's Social Security number started 123.

Orange County elections officials rejected his application, which was stamped with ACORN's label. 
So Mickey was never officially registered to vote. 
ACORN officials told the St. Petersburg Times, in a story published in October 2008, that the group scanned suspicious applications and that they believe the Mickey Mouse application did not come from them.

Florida law requires third-party groups like the now-defunct ACORN or the League of Women Voters to turn in every application to elections supervisors. The purpose is to prohibit a group from not turning in registrations it may not like because of a voter's party choice. 
Our ruling 
What's worth noting is that, in all three stories Eisnaugle cited, the fraud was exposed. The only real impact was that students in 2004 were registered as Republicans when they wanted to be registered as something else. It's also worth noting that it's unclear how HB 1355 -- had it been part of election law -- would have altered any of the above three scenarios. 
Here's what Lyndsey Cruley, a spokeswoman for House Republicans, told us in response to our efforts to contact Eisnaugle. 
""If you listen to Rep. Eisnaugle’s remarks in full, it is clear that his entire speech was directed only toward the actions of some third-party registration organizations,"" she said. ""Rep. Eisnaugle cited accurate information that such a third-party registration organization fraudulently submitted a registration for Mickey Mouse. In doing so, he intended to illustrate the need for provisions included in HB 1355 that would identify and prevent potential voter fraud from illegal voter registrations by third-party registration organizations. 
""Currently, there is no mechanism to identify which groups or person is responsible for submitting fraudulent registration forms and this measure would correct that, adding an additional layer of accountability to our state’s elections process. In sum, although Rep. Eisnaugle’s remarks could be interpreted, if taken out of context, in two different ways, he clearly intended to demonstrate that some third-party registration organizations have committed fraudulent actions here in Florida."" 
Cruley is right that the bill would require third-party groups like the League of Women Voters to identify voter registrations they submitted. 
But we're checking Eisnaugle's claim made on the House floor that Mickey Mouse was registered to vote.

Mickey never got that far. Someone filled out an application for him, but the application included so many inaccuracies that -- even if mice were allowed to vote in Florida -- Disney's animated superstar would have had problems. To us, the application looks more like a dumb prank than attempted voter fraud. And it was rightly rejected by the elections supervisor.

State Senator Tim Grendell says parent questionnaires to have a role in setting teacher pay
","
Ohio’s new collective bargaining law does away with the traditional pay structure for public workers that values work experience and replaces it with a system that focuses on job performance.

For public school teachers, the shift means teacher evaluations would be factored into their salary.

The new law, known as Senate Bill 5, has been signed by Republican Gov. John Kasich but it is not in effect yet. Organized labor groups and Democrats are trying to repeal SB 5 through a voter referendum this fall because they say the law is unfair to middle-class, working families.

State Sen. Tim Grendell, a Republican from Chesterland who voted against SB 5, criticized the new structure for paying teachers during a televised forum about the state budget April 18 in Cleveland.

""In Senate Bill 5, there is this new method of evaluating teachers…you’re also going to be rated on what the parents think of you and they can send questionnaires and surveys home to parents,"" Grendell said.

Allowing parents to play a role in evaluating teachers – and ultimately deciding how much they get paid – is problematic, Grendell said, because teachers are responsible for disciplining their children.

Since SB 5 continues to be a heavily debated issue and because supporters of the law have accused teachers unions of misleading their members about how the law will affect salaries, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Grendell’s claim.

Within SB 5 – a massive law change that overhauls collective bargaining for public employees and establishes numerous rules regarding pay and benefits – is a section devoted to paying teachers. The law eliminates the previous structure set in law, which sets raises based on a teacher’s education level and work experience.

The law says that school boards must adopt a pay structure based on a teacher’s performance. The law does not prescribe dollar amounts for salaries, but it says that districts must factor five categories into their performance-based pay schedule: what type of license the teacher holds, whether the teacher is ""highly qualified"" as defined by state law, students’ classroom performance, teacher performance evaluations, and any other criteria the board decides to incorporate.

Grendell’s claim related to teacher evaluations, so let’s zero in on that aspect of the performance-based pay structure. SB 5 includes a description of what the teacher evaluations would look like.

The law requires the State Board of Education to establish a framework for the evaluations. Local school districts then will adopt their own specific evaluations based on the state’s framework.

The evaluations will include whether parents and students are satisfied with a teacher, ""which may be measured by surveys, questionnaires, or other forms of soliciting feedback,"" the law reads.

Teacher evaluations also will measure how the teacher works in the classroom, which can be gauged by classroom observations; how the teacher communicates with students, parents, colleagues and members of the community; and students’ test scores.

Local school districts will have some discretion in deciding how to weight the different pieces of teacher evaluations, but they are expected to include each factor laid out under the new law.

As Grendell pointed out at the budget forum, the law does call for parent questionnaires to gauge parent’s satisfaction.

Randy Forbes says the U.S. pays China $73.9 million per day in debt interest
","
When Rep. J. Randy Forbes voted against the budget compromise between President Barack Obama and Republican leaders earlier this month, he said the measure did not do enough to cut the nation’s debt.

Forbes, R-4th, said failure to address the nation’s borrowing weakens the United States and strengthens China, the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt. The representative is chairman of the Congressional China Caucus and often discusses that nation’s growing military power.

""Each day our nation pays communist China $73.9 million in interest on our debt, money that is allowing them to aggressively modernize their military and increase their global influence,"" Forbes said in an April 14 press release.

Forbes’ number -- $73.9 million a day in interest payments to China  -- left our heads spinning. We set out to see if it was right.

First, a little background. The total federal debt, as of April 22, was $14.29 trillion. Of that amount, about $9.65 trillion is called public debt, which refers to all federal securities held by institutions and individuals outside the U.S. government. That includes China and other foreign nations.

The remaining debt -- about $4.64 trillion --  is held by the Federal Financing Bank, U.S. government trust funds, and other federal funds and accounts. The largest trust fund is the one that endows Social Security.

Our discussion and calculations for this fact check, as well as Forbes’, are based on the public debt.

China buys U.S. Treasury bonds in public auctions, the same way other nations and investment companies purchase our debt.

The Treasury Department said that as of February 2011, China, along with Chinese companies and investment groups, held $1.15 trillion in U.S. debt. Japan was the second-largest foreign holder, at $890.3 billion, with Great Britain third at $295.5 billion. In total, about $3.16 trillion of the U.S. public debt, or 33 percent, is held overseas. The rest is owned by Americans.

Because American debt has long been considered one of the safest investments in the world, the government can borrow money at very low costs, paying less than 2 percent average annual interest on its debt during the past decade.

In fiscal 2010, which ended Sept. 30, the federal government spent $197 billion on interest payments for public debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office. If we divide that by 365 days, we reach an average daily interest payment of $539,726,027. Because the Treasury doesn’t make payments on weekends or holidays, and because debt payments vary depending on when a Treasury note was issued, the actual daily number was probably never that exact amount.

On Sept. 30, 2010, China held about 12.8 percent of the U.S. public debt. If we assume China got 12.8 percent of our interest payments, it would have received roughly $68.9 million per day during fiscal 2010.

Forbes based his comments on fiscal 2011, in which the CBO estimates the government will spend $225 billion, or $616,438,356 per day, on interest payments. China held 12.1 percent of public debt at the end of February. So if the 2011 estimates hold and China holds the same proportion of debt throughout the year, it would receive about $74.4 million per day.

Forbes made his calculations with the March 16 public debt figures. That explains the $500,000 difference between his calculation and ours.

We don’t know the exact mix of debt held by China. If the debt owned there is primarily short-term bonds, then the interest rates would be lower. If China mostly holds 10-year or 30-year bonds, it would stand to receive higher payments. Our calculations, and those by Forbes, assume China’s debt holdings mirror the larger pool of U.S. debt.

Let’s review:

Rep. Randy Forbes says the United States pays $73.9 million per day in interest to China. He based his statistic on the percentage of U.S. debt held by China and the CBO’s estimate of how much we will spend on interest payments during the 2011 fiscal year.

We looked into the numbers and discovered that based on CBO and Treasury Department data, China likely received about $68.9 million per day during the 2010 fiscal year. Based on the nation’s February holdings and the CBO data, China should receive about $74.4 million per day in payments during the current fiscal year.

Forbes got the numbers right. We rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/26/randy-forbes/randy-forbes-says-us-pays-china-739-million-day-de/

Paul Krugman said large majorities favor higher taxes for the rich and no cuts to Medicare
","The debate to balance the federal budget and reduce the nation's debt has raged in recent weeks, with Democrats and Republicans arguing about spending, taxes and entitlements such as Medicare.

Paul Krugman wrote recently in his New York Times column that a knock-down, drag-out fight may be inevitable, given that the two parties have such different visions for the country.

""So when pundits call on the parties to sit down together and talk, the obvious question is, what are they supposed to talk about? Where’s the common ground?"" Krugman wrote.

Krugman, who sides with the Democrats over Republicans on budget issues, said the Democrats have a winning case to present to the public.

""For what it’s worth, polls suggest that the public’s priorities are nothing like those embodied in the Republican budget,"" Krugman said. ""Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy. Large majorities — including a majority of Republicans — also oppose major changes to Medicare. Of course, the poll that matters is the one on Election Day. But that’s all the more reason to make the 2012 election a clear choice between visions.""

We decided to check Krugman’s numbers on the polls after a reader asked us to look into it.  Let’s take the issues one at a time.

""Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy.""

Different polls phrase the question differently, but the bottom line is the same. We found three recent polls that back up Krugman’s point.

""In order to reduce the national debt, would you support or oppose raising taxes on Americans with incomes over 250 thousand dollars a year?"" Support: 72 percent. Oppose: 27 percent. Unsure: 1 percent. (ABC News/Washington Post Poll. April 14-17, 2011)

""Do you support or oppose doing each of the following to deal with the federal budget deficit? … Increase taxes on income over $250,000."" Support: 64 percent. Oppose: 33 percent. Unsure: 3 percent. (McClatchy-Marist Poll. April 10-14, 2011.)

""Now looking ahead to next year's federal budget, do you think it should or should not include higher taxes for families with household incomes of $250,000 and above?"" Should: 59 percent. Should not: 37 percent. Unsure: 4 percent. (USA Today/Gallup Poll. April 11, 2011.)

Krugman seems on firm ground here.

Large majorities ""also oppose major changes to Medicare.""

Again, we found several recent poll questions addressing this point.

""In order to reduce the national debt, would you support or oppose cutting spending on Medicare, which is the government health insurance program for the elderly?"" Oppose: 78 percent. Support: 21 percent. Unsure: 1 percent. (ABC News/Washington Post Poll. April 14-17, 2011.)

""I'm going to read you two statements about the future of the Medicare program. After I read both statements, please tell me which one comes closer to your own view. Medicare should remain as it is today, with a defined set of benefits for people over 65. OR, Medicare should be changed so that people over 65 would receive a check or voucher from the government each year for a fixed amount they can use to shop for their own private health insurance policy."" Should remain as is: 65 percent. Should be changed: 34 percent. Unsure: 2 percent. (Also from the ABC News/Washington Post Poll. April 14-17, 2011.)

""Do you think the government should completely overhaul Medicare to control the cost of the program, make major changes to Medicare but not completely overhaul it, make minor changes to Medicare, or should the government not try to control the costs of Medicare?"" Not try to control costs: 27 percent. Minor changes: 34 percent. Major changes: 18 percent. Completely overhaul: 13 percent. Unsure: 8 percent. (USA Today/Gallup Poll. April 11, 2011.)

""In order to reduce the federal budget deficit, would you be willing or not willing to reduce spending on Medicare, the government health insurance program for seniors?"" Not willing: 76 percent. Willing: 22 percent. Don't know/No answer: 2 percent. (CBS News Poll. March 18-21, 2011.)

""Do you think it will be necessary to cut spending on Medicare, the federal government health care program for seniors, in order to significantly reduce the federal budget deficit?"" No: 54 percent. No opinion: 27 percent. Yes: 18 percent. Not sure: 1 percent. (NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll. Feb. 24-26, 2011.)

""For each (government program), please tell me if you think significantly cutting the funding is totally acceptable, mostly acceptable, mostly unacceptable, totally unacceptable: Medicare."" Totally unacceptable: 46 percent. Mostly unacceptable: 30 percent. Mostly acceptable: 16 percent. Totally acceptable: 7 percent. Unsure: 1 percent. (Also from NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll. Feb. 24-26, 2011.)

Those numbers express widespread opposition to cutting Medicare. And indeed, when the Wall Street Journal reported its results in February, Republican pollster Bill McInturff said the results were ""a huge flashing yellow sign for Republicans on how much preparation will be needed if they propose to change Social Security and Medicare."" As we were working on this report, a new poll was released suggesting that the public might not be so opposed to changes in Medicare. We should note that these results were released publicly after Krugman's column appeared. As explained in the Principles of PolitiFact and the Truth-O-Meter, our rulings are based on the information known at the time the person made the remarks. ""In order to reduce the budget deficit, it has been proposed that Medicare should be changed from a program in which the government pays doctors and hospitals for treating seniors to a program in which the government helps seniors purchase private health insurance. Would you approve or disapprove of changing Medicare in this way?"" Approve: 47 percent. Disapprove: 41 percent. Don't Know/No answer: 12 percent. (New York Times/CBS News Poll. April  15-20, 2011.) The New York Times noted in its story that the response was at odds with other recent polls, and concluded that results may vary depending on how the question was asked. When we contacted Krugman for a comment, he noted that the poll came out after his column was published and that it's at odds with the other previous polls. ""I strongly suspect that the Times result is an outlier -- it looks so different from everything else we're hearing,"" Krugman said via e-mail. We should note that Krugman parenthetically added that a majority of Republicans also opposed major changes to Medicare. We were not able to find party breakdowns for all of these polls, but the ones we did see showed that Republicans opposed changes to Medicare as well. A CBS News Poll from March showed that 67 percent of Republicans were not willing to reduce spending on Medicare. In the USA Today/Gallup poll, 33 percent of Republicans said the government should not try to control the costs of Medicare, with another 28 percent of Republicans said the government should make only minor changes.

Our ruling

Krugman said that ""large majorities"" support support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy, and recent polls support that point. On Medicare, several polls suggest that large majorities, including a majority of Republicans, oppose major changes to the program. One poll, released after Krugman wrote his column, showed an advantage for the Ryan plan. But the preponderance of evidence at the time Krugman made his statement bears him out.

Donald Trump says Iraq has the second-biggest oilfields in the world
","
During an April 14, 2011, interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, businessman and potential Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Iraq is strategically important to the United States because of its vast supply of oil.

Trump said the United States spent $1.5 trillion on the Iraq War, and it could all go down the drain because the nation is so unstable.

""Iraq has the second-largest oilfields in the world. Fifteen trillion dollars worth of oil, second to Saudi Arabia. We go over, we decapitate their armies. Their armies are wiped out. They have weak armies, it is a corrupt society anyway, I mean, it's totally corrupt what is going on over there. We then leave in Iran which has fought for years back and forth, back and forth, because they were basically of equal strength, well, now they are not. Iran will come in. And they will take over Iraq, within two seconds after we leave, forget it, it is not even a contest. ...

""So, they are going to have the second-best oilfields in the world, second-biggest oilfields in the world that we made possible with our soldiers, thousands of people dead, wounded and … less importantly, $1.5 trillion. So, I said very simply. That if it is me, we take the oil. You know, in the old days, when you win a country, you win a country. Now with our stupid people, we win a country, we lose money, we lose soldiers, we lose lives, and then we leave.""

We won’t address Trump's opinions about Iraq and the war, but we did wonder whether he was right to say that ""Iraq has the second-largest oilfields in the world (behind) Saudi Arabia.""

Trump’s comment was rather disjointed, so we had to do a bit of interpretation before looking at the statistics. (We e-mailed his office but did not hear back.)

Based on the wording and context, we concluded that by referring to the ""second-largest oilfields in the world,"" Trump meant oil reserves, not production. He clearly indicates that Iraq’s fields are a valuable resource, and we concluded that the real prize is the oil remaining to be extracted, rather than what is being produced.

Second, we concluded that Trump had actually used the ""oilfields"" statistic to refer, interchangeably, to two distinct periods in time -- right before the Iraq War, and the present day. He used the same statistic in both referring to the eve of the Iraq War and also to what could happen in the near future if we abandon Iraq and Iran takes over. So we will look at the figures for 2002, the last full year before the Iraq War, and 2010, the most current statistics available.

So do the figures back up Trump’s claim? We turned to the website of the Energy Information Administration, the federal agency that compiles energy statistics.

One caveat: EIA says its estimates of energy reserves are from a variety of sources and may not be precise. Experts confirmed for us they can be inconsistent and sometimes exaggerated.

That said, let’s see what EIA says about Iraq and other countries.

In 2002, Iraq’s proven reserves of crude oil amounted to 112.5 billion barrels. That indeed ranks second to Saudi Arabia, with 261.8 billion barrels.

By 2010, Iraq’s proven reserves had risen slightly, to 115 billion barrels, but other countries passed it by. Saudi Arabia was still first, with 262.6 billion barrels, but new to the top tier were Venezuela (211.2 billion barrels), Canada (175.2 billion barrels) and then Iran (137.9 billion barrels).

So currently -- or in the near future, a time when Trump says Iran would ""take over Iraq"" within ""about two minutes after we leave"" -- Iraq ranks fifth in the world, not second, at least according to this estimate.

So where does this leave us? For the part of the comment in which Trump appeared to be talking about the eve of the Iraq War, he’s correct that Iraq had ""the second-largest oilfields in the world … to Saudi Arabia."" But where he flashes forward to a hypothetical, near-term takeover by Iran, Trump’s statistic is off slightly, since Iraq -- while still high on the list -- has been passed by three additional countries.

Sen. Stephen Wise says everybody on death row was in foster care
","
Here at PolitiFact Florida, we always welcome suggestions for claims worth checking.

This item came to our attention via Twitter from Florida Times Union political columnist Abel Harding.

""Sen. Stephen Wise: 'Every prisoner on death row was a foster kid.' Any way to check that @PolitiFact_FL?""

We were up for the task.

Wise's comment came during the March 30, 2011, Senate Education PreK-12 Committee hearing, during a discussion of SB 1546, a charter school expansion proposal sponsored by Sen. John Thrasher. The measure is aimed at authorizing state universities and other Florida College System schools to enter into charter school contracts with local school districts.

Leslie Poole, outreach director for the Washington, D.C.-based The Seed Foundation, a nonprofit that operates two high-performing ""urban boarding schools,"" testified before the committee about the success of the foundation's charter program. The foundation's two schools in the District of Columbia and Maryland have been featured on 60 Minutes. President Barack Obama held a bill-signing at the D.C. school in 2009, where he lauded the program as ""a true success story.""

When asked by Wise how many children in the program came through the foster care system, Poole responded that of the D.C. school's 336 students, about one-third of them have been touched by the child welfare system.

""I'll just say this to you members, so you can kind of know what the situation is in Florida,"" Wise said after Poole's comments.""One-third of all the inmates in the State of Florida come through the foster care system. Every person on death row was a foster care kid. This is a program that will make a difference in kids' lives.""

(You can hear the statement on this video of the meeting posted on the state Senate website. Wise's remark is about 41 minutes into the meeting.)

As of April 22, 2011, there are 393 inmates on death row, according to the Florida Department of Corrections. We were startled to hear that every one of these killers has something in common. Could it be that all of them had, at one point, been through the foster care system?

We wanted to ask Wise and his legislative staff for the source of his statement. But after calling and e-mailing him and his staff for four days, we never heard back.

So we started looking. 
State agencies and advocates

• Department of Corrections: The agency responsible for death row keeps stats on the age, race and gender of death row inmates -- you can view it online -- but has nothing regarding their upbringing, said department spokeswoman Jo Ellyn Rackleff. 
""All we keep is documents regarding their conviction, none of which would indicate if they were in foster care,"" Rackleff said in a phone interview.

• Florida Department of Children and Families: The agency that administers the state's foster care program says it collects no data on foster care children who wind up on death row. DCF does periodically survey adults ages 18 to 22  to determine their status after they leave foster care, and it produced a 2009 report titled ""Independent Living Transitional Services."" According to the report, roughly 9 percent of 1,500 respondents between the ages of 18 and 22 said they had been incarcerated within the past 12 months. 
""We do know that kids who have been in the foster care system have a higher risk of being arrested, but whether or not they end up on death row, that's too specific to know,"" said Diane Hirth, spokeswoman for DCF. ""If we tracked that information, we would have to do it in reverse. Why not track all the foster kids who graduated college and became successful?""

• Commission on Capital Cases: Created by the Legislature in 1997, the commission oversees capital punishment cases and ensures that those convicted have proper access to legal representation. Roger Maas, the commission's executive director who has headed the commission since its formation, said he does not have such statistics. 
""Let me know if you figure out if it's true or not,"" Maas said. ""I've never heard that, but it would be interesting to know.""

• Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty: This Tampa-based group advocates for the elimination of the death penalty and is headed by Mark Elliott. Elliott said he has not come across any studies similar to what Wise claimed. 
""It doesn’t sound familiar,"" Elliott said, before referring us to a Miami-based criminal attorney.

• Defense attorney: Terence Lenamon has made a name for himself representing high-profile death penalty cases, and founded the Florida Capital Resource Center, which collects statistics to provide to death penalty defense attorneys. He has been featured on CNN's Nancy Grace show and on the A&E reality crime-series The First 48. Lenamon currently represents Casey Anthony, the Orlando mother charged with murdering her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee Anthony. 
""I can assure you, not everyone on death row has been in the foster care system,"" Lenamon said in a phone interview. ""I have two guys on there right now who weren't in the foster care system. That right there dispels the theory.""

Two killers who weren't in foster care

The two clients Lenamon was referring to are Wadada Delhall and Harrel Braddy.

Delhall was sentenced to death row in September 2008, after a jury found him guilty of the first-degree murder of Hubert McCrae. Delhall reportedly shot McCrae 11 times in front of an auto-repair shop where McCrae worked. McCrae was a witness to a previous murder at the same shop in which Delhall's brother was a suspect.

During the sentencing hearing, Delhall's mother, Grace Allen, pleaded with the jury to spare her son's life, according to an Aug. 16, 2008, Miami Herald article. Allen told jurors how Delhall, her eldest son, assumed the responsibility of taking care of his five younger brothers when he was 18, because she was arrested on charges of drug trafficking in 1995.

""He took care of his brothers, but he was never in foster care,"" Lenamon said.

In Braddy's case, a Miami-Dade judge handed down the death penalty in 2007 for the 1998 killing of a 5-year-old girl. Braddy was accused of dumping Quatisha Maycock's body in the Florida Everglades, where she was attacked by alligators.

""The child was found dead in the Everglades with alligator bite marks on her head and stomach and her left arm severed,"" reads an Oct. 16, 2007, Miami Herald article on the trial. ""The medical examiner testified that the girl was still alive when one or more alligators bit her. Braddy told investigators he left Quatisha in the swamp because she witnessed him trying to kill her mother, who survived Braddy's choking attack.""

The article notes that both of Braddy's parents attended the trial, and Lenamon again stated his client was never in the foster care system.

""I think it's kind of an irresponsible assertion to make without backing it up,"" Lenamon said of Wise's claim.

Possible source

The closest we came to information similar to Wise's claim was a March 24, 2009, posting that appeared in an online forum maintained by the Sun-Sentinel.

The article was written by Mike Dunlavy, then chairman of Florida Youth Shine, a statewide advocacy group for foster care children. Dunlavy spent years in the Florida foster care system as a child, and was appointed by then-DCF secretary Bob Butterworth to a state Task Force for Child Protection.

In the online forum called ""The Slant,"" Dunlavy described a 2009 visit to Tallahassee to speak to the Senate PreK-12 Education Committee, of which Wise was also then a member.

Dunlavy wrote: ""Sen. Frederica Wilson, a Miami Democrat, asked, 'What happens to the foster youth who do not enter the Independent Living program.' That one was easy. 'Unfortunately,' I said, 'many of them fall to the wayside, contributing the root of the many ailments that plague our communities. Without support it's hard to imagine them creating a better way of life for themselves.'

""She followed up with a statistical question that no one in the room knew off hand. Trying to maintain my wit, I answered 'I'll research that,' but you all might find it interesting that recent research shows that every person currently on Death Row in Florida spent time in foster care.""

We tracked down Dunlavy in Jacksonville, where he remains active in foster care advocacy, to ask him about that comment. He said he received the anecdote from a Tallahassee lobbyist dealing with children's rights issues. He could not recall the name of the person who gave him that statistic, or what group she might have represented.

""I think it stretched so that it wasn't just kids in foster care, but kids who went through the adoption process, or kids who didn't quite make it into the foster care program but were abandoned,"" Dunlavy said. ""Thinking back, I don't know how complete that figure was.""

Our ruling

To us, this claim is woefully incomplete and unsubstantiated. The state agencies that supervise death row inmates and foster kids said they don't have information about inmates who were in foster care, nor do any other groups involved with death row or foster care that we could find. We easily found two cases of inmates on death row who had not been through the foster care system, disproving the claim of ""all"" death row inmates. A foster care advocate who made the same claim two years earlier says today he can't vouch for it.

Perhaps Wise was just repeating Dunlavy's comment from 2009, or perhaps he is privy to other information that ""every person on death row was a foster kid."" We wish that the senator had called back to tell us the source for his comment, because it carries a harsh sting for those who are or have been in foster care, as well as the officials, families and volunteers who work with them. If we hear from him later, we will update this item. For now, we rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2011/apr/25/steve-wise/sen-stephen-wise-says-everybody-death-row-was-fost/

Wisconsin Sen. Dan Kapanke says protesters at the Capitol damaged the windshield of his car
","
By now we're all familiar with the scene in Madison on the night of March 9, 2011. That's when Republican state senators -- with their Democratic colleagues still in hiding in Illinois -- approved Gov. Scott Walker's plan to strip most collective bargaining rights from public employees. 
As Republican senators made quick work on the bill, word spread like wildfire and angry protesters streamed to the Capitol Square.

The senators voted and headed out, taking care to avoid the crowd.

Tensions were high, along with concern for lawmakers’ safety. In the weeks leading up to the vote -- and on that evening -- there were reports of death threats emailed to lawmakers (one woman has been charged) and other concerns, from protests at the homes of GOP lawmakers to reports of nails strewn in their driveways.

A damaged windshield soon joined that list -- and quickly drew national attention.

It came to light a week later when state Sen. Dan Kapanke (R-La Crosse) and an aide told several news outlets, including the Journal Sentinel, he was scaling back public appearances in his district out of concerns for his safety. In doing so, they cited vandalism to his car while it was parked at the Capitol.

Did protesters damage the windshield of his car?

In the wake of a newly released police report on the incident let’s rewind the tape.

On the night of March 9, Kapanke’s car was parked in the Martin Luther King Jr. circle near an entrance of the Capitol, an area reserved for lawmakers. After the vote, police told Kapanke not to go to his car because the area was teeming with protesters, he said in an interview. An officer fetched the silver 2001 Honda Accord and delivered it to him at a nearby state office building.

Kapanke headed home to La Crosse.

On the road, he noticed something seemed wrong with the windshield.

""As I was driving, and it was dark, I noticed something across my windshield. I thought somebody might have used a marker"" to draw on the glass, he said in an April 9, 2011, interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin.

The damage he noticed was a crack, and he decided to report it to Capitol Police. He filed the report one week later, March 16, 2011, when he was next in Madison.

Kapanke said filed the report because authorities asked lawmakers to let them know if they experienced anything unusual.

According to the report, an officer and two state troopers, including an accident reconstruction specialist, looked over the windshield that day.  The Capital Times first reported April 5, 2011 on the police report.

""I informed Kapanke after looking at the chip and the crack it looked to me like a stone chip and not someone hitting the windshield,"" Capitol police officer Chris Weiss wrote in the report.

The troopers came to the same conclusion. The report also said police reviewed surveillance video of the parking area and saw no one damaging cars.

The report says Kapanke, one of the GOP senators facing a potential recall, was informed of the findings and the case closed on the day it was reported -- March 16.

But the public heard about the damage for the first time the following day, when the senator cited the damage while discussing plans to scale back his public schedule out of concerns for his safety.  

La Crosse Tribune reporter Chris Hubbuch inquired about the schedule changes on March 16, 2011, a few days after they were mentioned in a short email to local media outlets. In response, Kapanke’s office sent a new email that mentioned the safety concerns.

Hubbuch said he followed up and Kapanke aide Rose Smyrski called him back and listed the broken windshield as among the matters that was causing concerns for the senator’s safety.

""She said his window was broken,"" Hubbuch said.

Hubbuch said he used the term ""smashed"" in his story, which he called an ""unfortunate choice of words."" ""The implication to me was that somebody broke his windshield.""

Smyrski confirmed the conversation in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin -- the decision to cancel the events was made ""in conjunction with the threats."" She cited the emails, nails ""and then the broken window.""

It was the first time the windshield damage was cited in connection with the senator’s changed plans. But the La Crosse Tribune wasn’t the only one to hear the connection between the windshield and the canceled appearances.

Smyrski was cited in several other spots including the Journal Sentinel on March 17, 2011 saying the damaged windshield and other intimidation led the senator to change his schedule.

Kapanke told a La Crosse TV station in a story that aired March 17 that he was concerned for his safety. He reminded viewers of the Jan. 8, 2011 shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.

""In light of what happened in Arizona with the congresswoman, you know you’re a little bit more cautious and so we canceled a couple of meetings,"" he told the TV station. ""I want to be out with the people, I will still do that. I just won’t be quite as scheduled so people know in advance where I'm going to be at a certain time, I'm just going to go unscheduled if you will.""

The broken windshield story went national.

Websites including the Drudge Report and The Weekly Standard picked up on the story using headlines such as ""More Leftist Violence: Senator’s Property Damaged."" Fox commentator Glenn Beck also weighed in. Innumerable bloggers also linked to or rewrote the news accounts.

So let’s clear up this item.

Kapanke reported the windshield damage to Capitol police a week after noticing the damage -- the next time he was in Madison. On the day he filed the report, police blamed gravel -- not protesters -- for the damage.

Capitol Police told Kapanke their conclusion on the damaged windshield on March 16, 2011. Yet on that same day, and in the ensuring days, he and his staff publicly listed the damaged windshield -- blaming it on protesters -- as a rationale for scaling back public events in his district. Kapanke allowed the myth of the smashed windshield to run wild and uncorrected for almost three weeks after he knew it was not true.

What we do know is that we smell something like smoke -- like a smokescreen.

Education Association president says Virginia teacher salaries below national average
","
The Virginia Education Association has complained for decades that salaries for state teachers are below the national average.

Kitty Boitnott, president of the 60,000-member organization, made the claim during an April 20 interview with WVTF Public Radio in Roanoke about merit pay for educators.

""The General Assembly has offered numerous times to get our teachers into the national average, and we’re certainly nowhere near that, and yet now we’re going to offer limited incentives to just a handful of people,"" Boitnott said. ""That doesn’t make sense to me.""

We examined her claim that state teachers are paid below the national average.

Carol Donohue, the assistant director of government relations for the Virginia Education Association, said Boitnott’s information comes from a December 2010 report from the National Education Association.

The report shows that the average 2010-2011 salary for classroom teachers in Virginia was $51,559. That’s about 9 percent lower than the average national public teacher salary of $56,069, according to the report.

Virginia had plenty of company in paying its teachers below the national average. In addition to the Old Dominion, 34 other states had teacher salaries trailing the average, according to the NEA report.

Virginia’s average pay for teachers ranked 23rd-highest among states. The top average state-wide salary was $72,708 in New York, while the lowest was $35,201 in South Dakota.

So in raw dollars, Virginia’s average teacher salary ranks near the middle of states.

The amount of money it takes to live comfortably in Virginia is going to be different than what it takes in New York or South Dakota. So we looked at where Virginia ranks in cost of living.

Virginia was the 26th most expensive state to live in during the last quarter of 2010, according to a report by the Missouri Department of Economic Development.

In other words, Virginia ranks in the middle of state both in teacher salaries and cost of living.

The VEA has long argued that Virginia is wealthy and can afford to pay teachers better than most states. Higher salaries, it argues, would help Virginia recruit and retain the best instructors.

We looked at Virginia’s ability to pay more, turning to data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.

In 2010,Virginia’s per capita income was $44,762 -- the seventh highest among the states.

So it’s a logical argument that Virginia has greater ability than most states to pay teachers more. Virginians have higher salaries than most Americans. Their cost of living, meanwhile, ranks in the middle of states.

But we digress. Boitnott said Virginia pays its teachers below the national average and we owe you a rating on that.

"['Georgia', 'Public Health', 'Nathan Deal']","
Governor says Georgia health declining
","
Put down that Krispy Kreme, fellow Georgian. And quit smoking. You’re ruining our state’s reputation.

Georgians eat all the wrong things. We don’t exercise enough. Our children are plump.

It’s only getting worse, Gov. Nathan Deal said in a recent speech to the Georgia Public Health Association.

""Over the last 10 years, Georgia's public health has declined,"" Deal said.  

This statement made the PolitiFact Georgia team curious. Yes, we’re chubbier than we once were. But are we sliding in other areas?

Deal made the claim after the passage of House Bill 214, which would create a new Georgia Department of Public Health. The legislation elevates public health to a Cabinet-level position, which supporters think will give the health of Georgians the attention it needs.   

To back up the claim, Deal’s office sent us an essay from Atlanta Hospital News and Healthcare Report, an industry trade newspaper.

""Ten years ago . . . Georgia ranked 34th in health determinants in the United Health Foundation’s annual ranking of American states,"" it read. ""Today we’re 47th.""

We looked at the rankings ourselves.  

United Health Foundation’s America’s Health Rankings is a yearly initiative that has scored states’ overall health since 1990. The ranking is based on a wide range of measures such as the infant mortality rate, the prevalence of smoking, violent crime, the percent of children in poverty and cancer deaths.

We found that the figures in the trade newspaper article were slightly off target and don’t reflect the broader picture presented by the rankings.

But first, a little about measuring the health of large populations.

Assessing the health of communities is an art as well as a science, experts told us. Thousands of pieces of health data are available. Those who use them to publish rankings make judgment calls on what measures to use, what sources to consider, and how to weigh their importance.

Those measures aren’t always directly about health. They also can include high school graduation, poverty and crime rates. People who have lower incomes can have stress problems and poor access to health care and healthy food, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. These all hurt their well-being.  

""There is a correlation between health and wealth,"" Benjamin said.

Now, back to America’s Health Rankings.

In 2010, Georgia’s overall ranking was 36. This was a major improvement from 2009, when the state ranked 43.

The survey included rankings in subcategories that included the ""health determinants"" that the trade industry publication cited. They are circumstances and environmental factors that have a major impact on your health. Another subcategory was health outcomes, a measure based on mortality and other markers that show whether the population is healthy.

Georgia’s health determinants rank sank two notches from 35 to 37 between 2001 and 2010. But outcomes improved by five places from 40 to 35.

(America’s Health Rankings for 2010 came out after the Atlanta Hospital News and Healthcare Report essay was published. The 2009 data showed the health determinants rank declined from 36 in 2000 to 47, which is slightly different from the figures in the article. Outcomes ticked downward from 40 to 41.)

Georgia’s 2010 ranking was unusually good. The state peaked in 1996 at 32, then sank to the low 40s by 2001. It stayed there until last year.

Overall, however, America’s Health Rankings showed health in Georgia improved in some areas and declined in others.

The rankings’ authors consider obesity and smoking to be the two most important health factors because they cause a host of other problems. Obesity rose in the past decade, but smoking declined.

Other measures showed mixed outcomes. There were declines in some health factors such as the percentage of children in poverty, people without health insurance, and adults with high cholesterol. They all increased in the past decade.   

But other measures showed improvement. Cancer deaths, violent crime, infant mortality and rates of infectious disease all declined.

We looked for other sources of information to see if they showed different results. We consulted the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s Kids Count report, a well-regarded state-by-state measure of children’s health, and data from the Georgia Division of Public Health.

Between 2002 and 2010, Georgia’s Kids Count ranking mostly hovered in the low to mid-40s out of 50 states. That’s well below average, but not a clear decline. The percentage of low birth weight babies, obese children, and children in poverty increased, but other measures such as teen births, infant mortality and child deaths showed improvements.   

Georgia Division of Public Health figures paint a mixed picture as well.

All sources we consulted found that the health of Georgians improved in some important categories and declined in others.

Overall, Georgia’s health hasn’t truly ""declined"" in the past decade as Deal said. It’s consistently low compared with other states, and during the past 10 years, our record has been mixed.

Sen. Sherrod Brown says unionization rates are higher at companies that are foreign owned
","
The stated mission of the U.S. Commerce Department is to help make American businesses more innovative at home and more competitive abroad.

That mission made manufacturing and exports two of the top concerns of Sen. Sherrod Brown when his Senate Appropriations Subcommittee held a hearing on the department's proposed budget for fiscal 2012.

The Ohio Democrat called for a national manufacturing strategy, which is the goal of a bipartisan bill he introduced this month with Sen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican.

But Brown also asked Commerce Secretary Gary Locke what the department is doing to attract foreign investment to the United States. Foreign companies ""tend to invest in manufacturing"" and to spend money on research and development, Brown said.

""Foreign companies in the United States have a significantly higher unionization rate than other companies overall,"" he added.

That caught PolitiFact Ohio by surprise.

We knew that union membership has declined significantly since the 1980s, but we also knew that the United Auto Workers has struggled to organize workers at foreign-owned factories, mainly in the South. None of the factories operated by foreign automakers in the region has union workers.

Brown said he understood the surprise, given our auto-centric perspective, but assured us he could back up his statement.

He went a step further and provided specific numbers in a statement from his office: 12.4 percent of workers at foreign-owned U.S. subsidiaries are union employees while fewer than 7 percent of private-sector workers in the U.S. are union employees.

In support, Brown's staff referred us to the Organization for International Investment, a Washington-based business association representing U.S. operations of global companies. Its statistics, we confirmed, are drawn from publicly available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Their figures showed:
  
In sum, U.S. employees of foreign-owned companies have a higher rate of union membership than the U.S. workforce as a whole, and a much higher rate than workers in the private sector.

"['Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Mark Pocan']","
Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan says salaries and benefits for state workers total only 8.5 percent of state budget
","
When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took aim at public employees with his now-famous budget-repair bill, he used stark rhetoric to make a case for curtailing collective bargaining and making employees pay more for health care and pensions.  

""I don't have anything to negotiate. We are broke in this state,"" Walker said in February 2011, making a claim we ruled False. ""We have been broke for years. People have ignored that for years, and it's about time somebody stood up and told the truth. The truth is: We don't have money to offer.""

A week later, state Rep. Mark Pocan -- who drew a False from us for claiming Walker’s $3.6 billion estimate of the state budget deficit was ""bogus"" -- took aim at the Republican governor.

In a Feb. 19, 2011 blog post titled ""Scott Walker’s top ten lies,"" Pocan tried to shred Walker’s rationale for the budget-repair bill, which would reduce the deficit but is now tied up in court.

The Madison Democrat, a 13-year lawmaker, had this to say about what he labeled lie No. 9:

""Walker has said that our budget problems are largely due to employee wages. Not even close, Governor. Total salaries and compensation in the last budget were 8.5 percent of the entire state budget.""

Pocan’s claim got national exposure when it was re-posted two days later on the liberal DailyKos.com, a leading political website.

Although the claim was made weeks ago, it remains relevant. How much state employees cost taxpayers is central to the debate over their compensation and collective bargaining powers -- and we still get reader requests to check it out.

So we did.

Pocan’s assertion that employee wages and benefits comprise 8.5 percent of the state budget contained an asterisk, leading readers to a footnote. The footnote said the 8.5 percent figure came from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, but that the figure excluded the University of Wisconsin System and the Department of Corrections, which includes the state prisons.

Those are two massive state operations.

So, right off the bat, Pocan’s claim is dubious. If employees in major departments are not included, it’s going to make the overall cost of wages and benefits seem smaller.

Indeed, the footnote -- which did not explain why the two areas were excluded -- said that when the UW System and corrections are considered, employee compensation costs make up 17.7 percent of the state budget.

We wanted to see the Legislative Fiscal Bureau report that Pocan cited as his source, but Pocan refused to provide it. The bureau also would not provide the report, saying it was confidential to the lawmaker who requested it.

The Legislature Fiscal Bureau is generally regarded as the gold standard in financial matters of the state. But without seeing the bureau’s report, we don’t know what information it was asked to generate and we can’t see how it arrived at the two percentages cited by Pocan.

So, we sought out other sources.

Dale Knapp, research director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, cited the state’s 2010 Annual Fiscal Report, which shows that ""general purpose revenue,"" or the general fund budget, was $12.8 billion.

He also cited the state’s 2010 personal services and fringe benefit report, which showed that spending on salaries and benefits was $2.22 billion.

That means salaries and benefits were 17.3 percent of the state budget. That’s more than double Pocan’s 8.5 percent claim (though nearly the same as the 17.7 percent figure cited in his footnote.)

Since Pocan’s blog post attacked Walker, we also asked the governor’s office to weigh in. It provided a memo issued by the state budget office, which is part of Walker’s administration. The memo was issued to ""interested parties"" on Feb. 9, 2011, two days before Walker introduced his budget-repair bill.

The memo said employee compensation costs were $2.11 billion, nearly the same as Knapp’s $2.22 billion. However, the memo compared the employee costs to the ""state operations"" budget, which is only $3.67 billion, to conclude that employee costs make up 60 percent of that budget.

What’s going on here?

The compensation numbers are being compared against two different measures of state spending.

State operations covers only the UW System, corrections, the courts and other state departments -- in other words, direct services provided by state employees. The overall budget includes some $9 billion more that the state takes in and distributes to local governments, schools and individuals.

We asked two other government finance experts for guidance.

Milwaukee County Auditor Jerome Heer said the method used to calculate the 17 percent figure is reliable because it takes into account not only what the state spends to provide direct services but also what it sends to local governments and to individuals.  

City of Milwaukee Deputy Comptroller Mike Daun said there is value in the method used to calculate the 60 percent figure in that it relates only to the employee costs as a percentage of direct services.

However, both agreed Pocan’s 8.5 percent figure does not reflect the share of the state budget that goes to salaries and benefits.

Let’s sum up.

Pocan claimed in a blog post that salaries and benefits for state employees comprise 8.5 percent of the state budget. He did not provide evidence for the figure. In a footnote, Pocan acknowledged that two huge state operations -- the university system and corrections -- were not included, and that if they were, the figure is about 17 percent.

The Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance agreed with the 17 percent, while the state budget office argued that the figure is 60 percent. Experts said the two figures are different ways to express what employees cost. But everyone agreed that Pocan’s 8.5 percent -- the main number he used, which was repeated elsewhere -- is not accurate.

We rate Pocan’s statement False. 
(Editor's note: On April 25, 2011, the day after this item was published, Rep. Mark Pocan wrote in a blog post that we incorrectly stated in the item he refused to provide a memo that he relied on in making his claim about employee compensation.

We have searched for the email on this end, including having the Journal Sentinel’s IT department check all filters for an email sent at the time in question, and have no record of receiving it.

Our practice is to link to all of the source documents we use on items and would have done so with the memo Pocan requested from the fiscal bureau. The document in question simply reiterates the numbers that were cited. Thus, they do not affect the False ruling -- which Rep. Pocan has not challenged.

Here is a summary of our efforts to reach Rep. Pocan for his input on this item:

We emailed him April 8, 2011, asking for evidence he had to support his claim. We didn't get a reply, so we emailed him again April 12, and then emailed and called him on April 14. In the phone conversation, Pocan said he relied on a Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo in making his claim, but said that he would not send us the memo. We sent another email the same day, asking Pocan to reconsider.

That is all reflected in the email Rep. Pocan said he sent to us, which is linked in his follow up post on his blog. Pocan also linked to the memo.)",/factchecks/2011/apr/24/mark-pocan/wisconsin-rep-mark-pocan-says-salaries-and-benefit/
