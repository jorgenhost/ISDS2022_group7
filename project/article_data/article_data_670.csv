No, Obama did not settle 1 million ‘Islamics’ in Minnesota
","Amid nationwide demonstrations against police brutality, some protesters are demanding the defunding of police departments. A Facebook post claims the reason why protesters in Minneapolis are calling for defunding police is that they want to establish Islamic law there. The claim ignores the fact that the city is where George Floyd died May 25 after a police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes, sparking weeks of local and national protests. ""The point of defunding the Police in Minneapolis is that Minnesota is where Obama settled 1 Million Islamics. They want Sharia Law,"" the June 8 post stated. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s unpack this. The talk of defending the police doesn’t necessarily mean defunding them entirely. As we’ve reported, while some protesters want to eliminate police departments, others want to revisit the functions of the police and redirect some of that funding toward other services.  In Minneapolis, the City Council voted June 12 to begin efforts toward getting a charter amendment referendum on the November ballot. The proposal would eliminate the Minneapolis Police Department as a charter department and create a new public safety organization. A majority of council members have said they favor dismantling the Police Department. Refugee resettlement typically is reported based on the countries where refugees arrive from, not the religion they might practice. Minnesota, which has about 5.6 million people, has the nation’s largest number of people from Somalia, where more than 99% of the population is Muslim. Islam’s followers are Muslims, not ""Islamics."" About 1% of Minnesota’s population is Muslim. We rated as Pants on Fire a claim that President Barack Obama settled 43,000 Somalian refugees in Minnesota as part of plans to elect Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Muslim and Minnesota Democrat, in 2018. About 6,320 refugees from Somalia were resettled in Minnesota between 2009 and 2017, when Obama served as president, but the pattern of Somali settlement in Minnesota long predated Obama’s tenure in the White House. As we’ve reported, Sharia is a form of Islamic law, although Muslims differ on its interpretation. It is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living and financial dealings. Muslims living in the United States can put marital disputes and other personal matters in front of a tribunal made up of leaders of their faith. That’s allowed and has been used by Catholics, Jews, Lutherans, Baptists and other religions for decades. It falls under the umbrella of mediation, when people agree to work out their differences through a process outside of the courts. For any other situation, the government’s legal system prevails. . As Cyra Akila Choudhury, a law professor at Florida International University, told us for another fact-check: ""If Muslims choose to abide by Sharia as a private matter with regard to the practice of their religion, it is protected by the Constitution insofar as the practice does not contravene the laws of the land. So, for example, Sharia principles of criminal law would not be given accommodation."" We didn’t find evidence of any effort to establish Sharia in Minneapolis. Micaela Schuneman, refugee services director for the International Institute of Minnesota, a nonprofit that does refugee resettlement in the Twin Cities, told PolitiFact that claiming that Muslims want to install Sharia ""is a fear tactic often cited by people opposed to refugee resettlement. But I am unaware of plans in any Minnesota communities to pass new laws or ordinances"" based on Sharia. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, which describes itself as the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, on June 10 called for dialogue with St. Charles, Mo., Mayor Dan Borgmeyer after Borgmeyer ""falsely"" claimed that Muslims in Minneapolis are seeking to enact Islamic principles into law. A Facebook post claimed: ""The point of defunding the Police in Minneapolis is that Minnesota is where Obama settled 1 Million Islamics. They want Sharia Law."" The number of refugees from Somalia, which is nearly 100% Muslim, resettled in Minnesota under Obama is 6,320. Minneapolis is where the death of George Floyd occurred, touching off protests against police racism brutality. There is no evidence that efforts to defund the police in Minneapolis are at all related to Sharia.

How the Black Lives Matter Global Network is set up
","As donations continue to flow into Black Lives Matter, some conservative commentators claim the civil rights organization behind the movement is not an actual charity. ""According to its website Black Lives Matter, Inc is NOT a charity. It is a full-fledged corporation that does NOT have any locations,"" said Candace Owens in a June 11 tweet. ""Can anyone tell me then where the hundreds of millions BLM has raised goes?"" The tweet, which has also been shared as a screenshot on Instagram, has been retweeted more than 47,000 times. The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.)  We previously fact-checked a false claim that donations to Black Lives Matter are funneled to ActBlue, a nonprofit technology company that helps Democratic campaigns and causes raise funds. So we wanted to look into this post, too. (Screenshot from Twitter) Owens is wrong. The Black Lives Matter Global Network is incorporated in Delaware, but it’s a charity that’s fiscally sponsored by another nonprofit called Thousand Currents. The Black Lives Matter Global Network has chapters around the country. The Black Lives Matter movement is decentralized with no formal hierarchy. It was co-founded by three black community organizers in 2013, Patrisse Khan-Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi, following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida. Khan-Cullors, Garza and Tometi created Black Lives Matter Global Network as an outgrowth of that movement, with a stated mission to ""build local power and to intervene when violence was inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes."" The network was incorporated in Delaware in November 2016, according to the state’s corporations division. But nowhere on its website does the Black Lives Matter Global Network describe itself primarily as a ""corporation,"" as Owens claimed — and the organization still operates as a charity. Incorporation is a common first step toward becoming a nonprofit organization because it offers tax advantages and legal protections. While nonprofits that incorporate are technically corporations, they are still considered nonprofits. Why?  ""Congress has created almost three dozen types of tax-exempt organizations in different sections of the tax code,"" says the National Council of Nonprofits. ""The one common condition is not paying out profits"" to owners or shareholders. For example, the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which owns PolitiFact, is incorporated in Florida and uses its earnings to develop teaching programs and online content for journalists. The institute also has an incorporated foundation. Similarly, the Black Lives Matter Global Network has a foundation that was incorporated in Delaware one year after the network. Since it’s a relatively new nonprofit, the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation has a partnership with a larger organization that oversees its finances. In 2016, the Black Lives Matter Global Network approached Thousand Currents, a nonprofit organization that partners with grassroots groups and movements, to create a fiscal-sponsorship agreement. Fiscal sponsorships are set up when a charitable organization is ""not yet recognized as tax-exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3),"" according to the National Council of Nonprofits. ""In this capacity, we provide administrative and back-office support, including finance, accounting, grants management, insurance, human resources, legal and compliance,"" a spokesperson for Thousand Currents said in an email. ""Donations to BLM are restricted donations to support the activities of BLM."" Since the Black Lives Matter Global Network is not yet its own 501(c)(3) organization, it does not have publicly available tax returns. Other nonprofits named after the Black Lives Matter movement, such as the ""Black Lives Matter Foundation"" in California, are not associated with the network, BuzzFeed News reported June 15. However, some financial information about the Black Lives Matter Global Network is available on Thousand Currents’ most recent financial audit. RELATED: ‘Defund the police’ movement: What do activists mean by that? That document indicates that, as of June 2019, Thousand Currents held $3.35 million in assets representing restricted donations for the Black Lives Matter Global Network. The same audit shows that $1.8 million in restricted donations were released to Black Lives Matter in the year ended June 30, 2019. Referred to simply as the ""fiscal project"" on Thousand Currents’ audit, Black Lives Matter spent much of that money on salaries, consultants and travel. We look at Thousand Currents’ most recent tax returns to get a clearer picture, but they do not report separate expenditures for the Black Lives Matter Global Network or a ""fiscal project."" In a June 11 statement, the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation announced the creation of a $6.5 million fund for grassroots organizing efforts. The fund is available to all chapters affiliated with the network and will give unrestricted grants of up to $500,000. The Black Lives Matter Global Network has active chapters in 16 cities in Canada and the United States, according to its website. Most chapters have a website and corresponding social media profiles, many of which are verified. We reached out to the Black Lives Matter Global Network repeatedly for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Regardless, Owens’ tweet is inaccurate.

Was race the only difference in sentencing of two defendants in Florida?
","Research shows African Americans face harsher treatment than whites in the criminal justice system, including longer prison sentences. A Facebook post tries to illustrate that point through a graphic comparing the results of two cases overseen by the same judge.  The post compares the case of Chase Legleitner, a white 19-year-old, with Lamar Lloyd, a black 21-year-old. It says that Legleitner was sentenced to two years in jail while Lloyd was sentenced to 26 years in prison — both by Circuit Court Judge Sherwood Bauer Jr. in the 19th Circuit in Martin County.  The claim gets the basic facts correct, but it omits an additional difference in the white defendant’s case. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A similar graphic has circulated at least since 2018.  This claim was also shared by various celebrities commenting on racial injustice in June following the death of George Floyd in police custody.  The juxtaposition of the two robbery cases is from the Sarasota Herald-Tribune’s award-winning 2016 ""Bias on the Bench"" series. The newspaper examined millions of court documents on crimes in Florida from 2004 through 2016. The investigation concluded that blacks are more likely to be found guilty than whites and usually get longer sentences.  One article used the sentences for Legleitner and Lloyd as an example to show that Bauer sentenced African Americans to longer terms. Bauer told the newspaper that race is of ""complete insignificance"" in his treatment of defendants. Here are the basic facts of the two cases: Legleitner robbed men in a 2008 drug deal. Lloyd robbed a Pizza Hut and gas station the following year. Both men pleaded no contest to two counts of armed robbery and had open pleas, which means they weren’t promised a particular sentence. Each had a single misdemeanor on his record and tallied the same point total on scoresheets used to determine incarceration time. Based on their score of 138 points, the state’s guidelines called for a sentence of just under seven years to life in prison. Bauer sentenced Lloyd to 26 years in prison in 2010, and the following year sentenced Legleitner to about two years in jail, including time already served. David Lustgarten, the assistant state attorney who prosecuted Legleitner, told PolitiFact that the defendants’ point totals on the scoresheet don’t tell the full story. Lustgarten said he was familiar with the facts of Lloyd’s case. Legleitner, he said, was one of about a half dozen defendants who were involved in a scheme to approach other men under the guise of buying drugs, but planned to rob them. Legleitner helped the prosecution build the case against the co-defendants who were armed, including testifying against one at trial. ""I told Judge Bauer at sentencing that without his testimony I would have never secured a conviction against the two bad actors,"" Lustgarten said.  The Herald-Tribune article alluded to the fact that Legleitner cooperated when it stated that ""the prosecutor lobbied hard for leniency."" Legleitner’s defense attorney didn’t respond to our questions. Lloyd’s case involved fewer defendants.  Lloyd’s was a ""clear-cut case,"" said Adam Guzi, who prosecuted Lloyd and recommended a 30-year sentence. Guzi said he had witness accounts from the Pizza Hut and the Sunoco gas station as well as another witness who had spotted the defendants appearing to inspect another restaurant earlier. Prosecutors didn’t need Lloyd’s cooperation to convict the other man, Guzi said. Lloyd’s defense attorney, J.D. Lewis IV, said he thought that his client’s sentence was outrageous at the time. But asked about the role of race in Lloyd’s sentencing, he told PolitiFact, ""I can’t personally say there is evidence that race was a factor."" In general though, Lewis said he believes that there are racial disparities in the criminal-justice system. ""I would be naive to think racism does not play a part in the criminal justice system,"" he said. Following the Herald-Tribune’s series, the 12th judicial circuit wrote a rebuttal, which included an analysis of the two robbery cases handled by Bauer in the 19th circuit. Bauer’s office directed us to part of the rebuttal written by Diamond Litty, public defender for the 19th circuit (Legleitner and Lloyd both had private counsel.) The public defender pointed to Lustgarten’s testimony at the sentencing hearing that Legleitner was ""morally cooperative, honest, forthright, and remorseful.""  The public defender also noted that Legleitner stole from someone who was a drug user or dealer, while Lloyd stole from employees at work. We sent a summary of our findings to Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice advocacy group.  Mauer questioned why states have a complex scoring system in their sentencing guidelines if it doesn’t pick up significant case distinctions. ""In this case, essentially the black defendant gets sentenced by the guidelines system and the white defendant gets the benefit of wide-ranging judicial discretion,"" he said. ""This doesn't necessarily mean that the white defendant ‘got off too easy’—  just as likely that the black defendant got punished too severely.""  Prosecutors have long recommended a reduced sentence in exchange for a defendant’s cooperation, Mauer said. But in the era of mandatory sentences and enhanced prosecutorial power, the scale of that benefit has increased dramatically.   ""So defendants who don't have information to trade or wish to contest the charges are faced with the prospect of a dramatically higher sentence for the same conduct as another who chooses to plead guilty,"" he said. A 2000 research report by the National Institute of Justice, a federal agency, concluded that despite decades of reform efforts, in some jurisdictions, blacks and Hispanics received longer sentences or differential benefits from guideline departures than similarly situated white offenders.  The disparities appeared in Southern and non-Southern jurisdictions, in state and federal court systems, and in jurisdictions with and without sentencing guidelines. A Facebook post said a white armed robbery suspect was sentenced to two years in jail while a black armed robbery suspect was sentenced to 26 years in prison by the same Florida judge in two separate cases. The post gets the basic facts correct: The two defendants both pleaded no contest to the same crime, both had one prior misdemeanor and both scored the same number of points on a system designed to calculate their sentences. But prosecutors said the white defendant got a reduced sentence after cooperating with prosecutors to convict co-defendants, a fact that’s not mentioned in the graphic.  We rate this claim Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2020/jun/17/facebook-posts/was-race-only-difference-sentencing-two-defendants/

Claim that state workers are being paid to sit “idle” at home leaves out context
","The coronavirus pandemic has left millions without work in the United States. In Wisconsin, more than 2.6 million weekly unemployment claims were filed between March 15 and May 30, 2020. And though the number of weekly claims has gradually declined, more than 728,000 claims remained unpaid at the end of May.  The state Department of Workforce Development is working to hire additional workers to handle unemployment claims. But former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who lost to Democrat Tony Evers in 2018, has his own idea of how to tackle it. ""Assign all state employees who have been idle at home to process unemployment benefits,"" Walker said in a June 5, 2020 tweet. Are there really state workers sitting ""idle at home"" during the crisis? The June 5, 2020 tweet wasn’t the first time Walker, who is now president-elect of the conservative group Young America’s Foundation, made such a claim.  In a May 20, 2020 New York Times Op-Ed, he wrote ""many state government employees are still receiving paychecks as they sit idle at home."" When asked to back up the claim, a Walker spokesperson pointed to a March 23, 2020 memo to Wisconsin state employees from Department of Administration secretary Joel Brennan.  A provision of the memo says non-essential employees who are unable to do their jobs from home are eligible to use up to 80 hours of paid administrative leave.  Employees eligible for the administrative leave are available for alternative assignments, including to support ""various activities around the state’s COVID‐19 response efforts,"" according to the memo. The provision took effect March 25, 2020. Both non-essential employees and appointed employees are eligible for administrative leave, but those hired in response to the coronavirus pandemic are not. The memo says employees may use the money to cover normal work hours for those who are sick or deemed ""unable to telework"" by their supervisor.  Wisconsin Department of Administration spokesperson Molly Vidal called Walker’s statement a ""gross oversimplification."" Vidal said the policy allows employees who have not yet earned paid administrative leave benefits ""to access leave if they contracted COVID-19, needed to care for a family member with COVID-19 or due to the sudden closure of childcare facilities.""  She emphasized that employees are required to use up all other leave options — such as paid vacation time — before being able to use this administrative leave. Vidal added that 8 percent of eligible state employees are using the program -- or, about 2  percent of all state employees. These employees, she noted, are often custodians, facility repair workers and tour guides.  Beyond that, hundreds of state employees have been temporarily reassigned to assist with the state’s coronavirus response, according to Vidal. Some of the tasks include transporting testing supplies and becoming coronavirus contact tracers.  Walker claimed there are state employees being paid to sit ""idle"" at home. Although there are state employees who are being compensated while unable to work due to coronavirus, there are stipulations that need to be met before a non-essential worker can qualify for paid administrative leave. What’s more, some people in nonessential jobs and unable to work from home have been put on to other COVD-related tasks. Our definition of Half True is ""the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""

CNN did not lighten a photo of the man accused of driving into Seattle protesters
","A popular hoax on Facebook and Instagram falsely claims that CNN doctored an image of a man who allegedly drove into a crowd of protesters in Seattle. After his vehicle came to a stop on June 7, driver Nikolas Fernandez allegedly shot and wounded one of the demonstrators at the protest, which took place in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood. Large crowds have been gathering there since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in late May. The incident is one of several in which motorists have targeted nationwide protests against police brutality in recent weeks. But a June 14 Facebook post claims that CNN’s coverage of the Seattle shooting was manipulated. ""CNN lightened the photo of the man who drove into the protester last night in Seattle,"" reads text on the image, which was shared by a fan page for President Donald Trump ""They said he was white..

It’s been shared more than 5,500 times, and we’ve seen many similar posts online. (Screenshot from Facebook) On June 12, Fox News ran digitally altered photos of the so-called Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, also known as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest, where demonstrators have gathered for the past week without police. Did CNN do the same thing? No — the social media posts are inaccurate. The photo of Fernandez appears to be doctored. ""This ‘framegrab’ social media post was flagged to us earlier, and it certainly looks doctored from all of our double checking,"" said Bridget Leininger, senior director of communications at CNN, in an email. ""CNN reported the story, but did not identify the person. Also, the logo added into this social media account’s ‘framegrab’ is not CNN style. CNN does not alter skin tone."" CNN’s digital story about Fernandez does not identify or include an image of him. But just to be sure, we checked the tape. None of the network’s coverage from the week after the Seattle shooting included a close-up photo of Fernandez. Instead, it relied on eyewitness video that showed a car driving into a crowd and protesters running away. The photo in the Facebook post includes a white CNN logo with a red background on top of the lightened image of Fernandez. But CNN’s television coverage usually has a red logo with a white background in the lower third of the screen. It also includes the time and whether the coverage is live — details that the Facebook image leaves out. (Screenshot from CNN) The original photo of Fernandez holding a gun was taken by Dean Rutz, a photographer for the Seattle Times. It does not appear to be lightened.

Conspiracy claim linking COVID-19 reports with the number 322 is nonsense
","Some people can’t resist a good conspiracy. Turns out, many also can’t resist one that’s exceptionally easy to disprove. An array of Facebook posts recently surfaced singling out the number 322 and a purported connection to COVID-19. In a social media landscape rife with claims about manufactured COVID case and death tallies, and conspiracies related to vaccines, 5G cell towers and whatever else, the clear implication is there’s something nefarious going on.

That post was accompanied by 17 different photos noting the number 322 in headlines dating back to March. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). We found at least 15 different versions of this claim scattered across Facebook, together shared thousands of times. The comments on the various posts offer a smorgasbord of explanations. Some noted the ""Skull and Bones"" secret society at Yale University is also called ""Order 322."" Others noted the numbers add up to seven, or that terrorist attacks in London and Brussels occurred on March 22 (3/22). Sigh. Allow us to point out the obvious. You can find this supposed connection to COVID-19 with just about any number in the low three-digit range. We’re in the midst of a global pandemic that is unprecedented in this age of media saturation. All manner of local and regional publications have been reporting on COVID-19 case and death numbers for months. There is no time in history where this many media outlets have been so focused for this long on one singular topic — particularly one in which counting stats are so critical and readily available through online searches. In other words, there are a lot of media outlets posting a lot of numbers. And America really loves units of government. Across the nation you’ll find more than 3,000 counties. Beyond that, there are nearly 20,000 incorporated places (primarily cities, towns, villages, boroughs), about 3,000 of which have at least 10,000 people. Add that to the 50 states and, well, the entire rest of the world, and you’ve got a lot of places tallying COVID data that could potentially add up to 322. But in case you’re somehow not convinced yet, we’ll follow the advice of one poster and Google this. We ran a Google News search using the terms ""322 cases"" AND COVID, to find online references to where ""322 cases"" appeared as a unit on a page that also referenced COVID. Then we did the same with the numbers around 322. Here’s what we found as of about noon on June 16, 2020. ""320 cases"" AND COVID — 8,660 results (larger, since many reports round off the numbers) ""321 cases"" AND COVID — 1,170 results ""322 cases"" AND COVID — 1,960 results ""323 cases"" AND COVID — 2,240 results ""324 cases"" AND COVID — 1,600 results ""325 cases"" AND COVID — 2,530 results We’ll spare you another set of bullets, but searches with the word ""deaths"" in place of ""cases"" yields the same type of results. In other words, you can find COVID-19 media reports citing any number in that range. An array of Facebook posts claim a link between the number 322 and COVID-19 in media reports. The implication is that there is something shady or manufactured in the way these tallies are reported. But even in the context of social media in 2020, this is ridiculous. The volume of media reports on COVID-19, the number of cases and the number of local and regional units of government means there is ample opportunity for tallies to add up to just about any number, particularly in the low triple digits. Google searches prove out that 322 isn’t even a particularly common number. We rate this Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2020/jun/16/facebook-posts/conspiracy-claim-linking-covid-19-reports-number-3/

Blacks, Hispanics less likely to have jobs where they can work from home
","The coronavirus has hit the African American and Hispanic community particularly hard. In New York City, for example, the death rate for African Americans is double the white death rate. In an interview on CNN, Desiree Rogers, CEO of the cosmetic firm Black Opal Beauty and former social secretary in the Obama administration, said the jobs black people do put them more at risk. ""We know that only 20% of African Americans had jobs where they could work from home,"" Rogers told CNN June 10. ""What does that tell you? They don't have the capacity to be able to work from home. They have service jobs, and so that means they have to be out."" Social distancing under COVID-19 thrust millions of workers into telework. Rogers’ stat that only one in five African Americans were able to exercise that option is accurate. The American Time Use Survey has been asking households how they spend their time since 2003. Broadly, people report what they have done in a 24-hour period. According to the latest survey data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 19.7% of African Americans could work at home. The fraction was even lower for Hispanics — about 16%. The option to work at home was available to 30% of whites and 37% of Asians. The figure for all workers is 28.8%. Economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics said their survey doesn’t show why the numbers play out the way they do, but they pointed to government data on race and ethnicity and type of job. Black Americans represent a bit over 12% of all workers, but are 26% of workers in health care support occupations, a field that includes hospitals and nursing homes. Those are places of high risk for exposure to the coronavirus.  There are other reasons why the virus has a disproportionate impact on African Americans, including underlying health conditions and less access to health care.  Rogers said that only 20% of African Americans have jobs where they could work from home.

No, this photo doesn’t show a woman George Floyd assaulted
","In the wake of worldwide protests against police brutality following the death of George Floyd, some internet users are spreading misinformation about Floyd’s arrest record.  Floyd had multiple brushes with the law and was sentenced to serve five years in prison for his involvement in an armed robbery in 2007 while he still lived in Houston. But the facts of the incident have gotten muddled on the internet, and some posts claim the woman robbed, Aracely Henriquez, was pregnant and that Floyd beat her and threatened to kill her baby. Social media users are also sharing a photo of a woman with bruises and cuts on her face, claiming it’s Henriquez.  Here, the photo appears on Instagram. We won’t repost the text or image here, because the photo is not of Henriquez, and several of the details about the robbery are either made up or exaggerated.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

""I posted my story over a year ago to use my voice to spread awareness and encourage other women to speak out about the injustices they've faced. Today my photo is being used as political propaganda/click bait to make people believe that George Floyd deserved to die. I am disgusted and humiliated, not for myself, but for my country."" Meanwhile, some of the assertions made about the details of the robbery are not accurate.  Floyd was arrested in 2007 for his involvement in an armed home robbery and was sentenced to five years in prison, but court records do not indicate that Henriquez was pregnant at the time of the incident, or that Floyd threatened to kill her baby. According to the police’s probable cause report, Henriquez, another woman and a toddler were home at the time of the incident and Floyd was one of multiple men who forced their way into the home, during which he threatened her with a gun. She was injured during the home invasion, but the report says her injuries were inflicted by another man, not Floyd. An Instagram post claims an image of a woman with bruises on her face is Aracely Henriquez, the victim of an armed home robbery that Floyd was involved in. But the image isn’t of Henriquez. It shows an American student who was assaulted in Madrid in 2018 . Floyd served five years in prison for the armed robbery, but there is no evidence that Henriquez was pregnant at the time, and her injuries were inflicted by another man.

Widely shared Facebook posts mislead on COVID-19 mortality rate
","Determining the death rate of COVID-19 is a big challenge, especially at this still-early stage in the pandemic.  Health officials and epidemiologists say there are many unknowns: How many people got infected but were never tested? How many died of the disease without being counted as coronavirus deaths?  The answer is a moving target and at least one health expert believes it could be many months before a precise mortality rate is known.  ""We won’t know until a year from now,"" said Thomas Novotny, professor emeritus of epidemiology and biostatistics at San Diego State University. ""There’s so much we don’t know.""  That uncertainty, however, hasn’t stopped claims from catapulting across social media saying the severity of the virus was overblown. Posts cut and pasted and shared thousands of times on Facebook and Instagram say: ""The CDC just confirmed a 0.2% death-rate for COVID19,"" suggesting the rate is far lower than officials previously reported. The posts also claim that government officials misled the public about the number of coronavirus deaths and argue that closing down the economy wasn’t necessary.   This is a screenshot of one of the many misleading and widely spread Facebook posts that claims the CDC ""confirmed"" a 0.2% mortality rate for COVID-19. The federal agency hasn’t established a mortality rate for the disease.  Several of these posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook). The posts, some of which implore readers to ""make this viral,"" include multiple misleading and false statements. But for this fact check, we decided to focus on whether the CDC has really ""confirmed"" a 0.2% mortality rate and to offer some context on the lethality of the virus. We will base our rating on that specific claim. Background On Mortality Figures On March 3, the World Health Organization announced that 3.4% of confirmed coronavirus patients around the world had died. That figure is what epidemiologists call a ""case fatality rate.""  The ratio is ""crudely calculated by dividing the number of reported deaths over the number of reported confirmed cases,"" Carla Drysdale, a WHO spokeswoman, told PolitiFact National in March. She also said the ratio would change over time and vary from place to place.  But the mortality rate, or ""death rate"" as the Facebook posts terms it, is much more difficult to determine. It is calculated by dividing the number of people who die from COVID-19 in a certain geographic area by the total estimated number of people infected. It doesn’t rely solely on confirmed deaths and infections. The biggest problem is the denominator. Many who develop mild cases of COVID-19 or show no signs at all are never tested and thus aren’t counted, skewing the ratio.  Did The CDC Really ‘Confirm’ A 0.2% Death Rate? The Facebook post’s claim that the CDC ""confirmed"" a 0.2% death rate draws on information in a planning document the federal agency published in May. The 0.2% figure is included, but it’s the lowest in a range of five estimates. Earlier this month, USA Today analyzed the five scenarios in the document while fact-checking the same claim about a 0.2% death rate that had spread widely on Facebook and Instagram.  ""The first four are varying estimates of the disease's severity, from low to high, while the fifth represents the 'current best estimate,'"" USA Today reported. ""The range of estimates put the fatality rate for those showing symptoms between 0.2%-1%, with a 'best estimate' of 0.4%. It also places the number of asymptomatic cases between 20%-50%, with a 'best estimate' of 35%. By combining the two estimates, the estimated overall fatality rate of those infected with the virus – with and without symptoms – would be 0.26%.""  The USA Today fact check concluded that saying the CDC has ""confirmed"" 0.2% as the death rate ""paints a misleading picture because the CDC has clearly stated the number is subject to change. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said the claim in the social media posts is simply ""wrong. The CDC did not confirm that."" He estimated COVID-19’s death rate at ""between 0.8% and 1.0%.""  ""No serious examination of the data from this pandemic would lead one to conclude that 0.2% is a realistic possibility,"" Jha wrote in an email.  The Facebook posts also attribute several quotes to ""the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute."" An online search shows Jha made similar statements, but on a completely separate topic.  ""This is pretty stunning to me — my quote being misused to promote a falsehood,"" Jha said, noting he had not been aware of the posts before being contacted by PolitiFact California. Several health experts have described the CDC estimates as low and lacking in transparency.  Nicholas Jewell, professor of biostatistics at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health,  questioned the CDC’s 0.26% mortality rate, saying ""it’s not transparent where that comes from."" ""That’s very much on the low-end of what’s been reported by good studies,"" he added.  The CDC did not respond to a request for comment.  Health officials have cited a May study from the University of Washington, which estimated that if all infections were known, the true death rate for Americans who show symptoms would be about 1.3%. From a public health perspective, Jewell said that claims like the one spreading on Facebook can ""do a lot of damage, largely because when it’s seized on, it undercuts your message"" to continue social distancing and wearing masks.  ""The whole idea that this wasn’t so bad is just, in my view, nonsense,"" Jewell said. Asked about the mortality rate claim in the Facebook posts, Novotny, the professor of epidemiology at San Diego State University, said ""it misrepresents what the risks are.""  Comparing COVID 19’s Mortality Rate To Influenza In March, Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told PolitiFact National that most experts believe the ultimate death rate for this coronavirus will wind up being higher than the rate for seasonal flu, which hovers around 0.1%. That lines up with what Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Congress during his March testimony. ""The percent mortality will depend on what the denominator of number of cases is,"" Fauci said. ""So if you’re not counting every case, the mortality will be high. If you are counting a lot of cases that are sub-clinical, mortality will become low. But no matter how you slice it, it’s many, many, many more times lethal than the influenza that we get in the season."" Our ruling Facebook posts claim the CDC ""confirmed a 0.2% death-rate for COVID19.""  The claim draws from the low-end of a range of estimates the CDC published in May saying the fatality rate for those showing symptoms was between 0.2% and 1%, with a ""best estimate"" of 0.4%. The estimated overall mortality rate of those with and without symptoms would be 0.26%.  Health experts, however, said it’s difficult to pin down a precise mortality rate early in a pandemic and that the federal agency hasn’t yet ""confirmed"" any rate but instead offered best guesses. Over time, it is possible that estimates will show a lower than initially expected mortality rate, especially as more testing is conducted in the United States.  Currently, however, the true number of deaths and infections are hard to determine, as some deaths caused by the virus aren’t counted and many people with mild cases of the coronavirus are never tested.  Several experts said they project the mortality rate is on the higher-end of the CDC’s estimated range, closer to 1%, which is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.  In the end, the post wrongly suggests that health officials have established COVID-19’s true mortality rate and selectively picks the low-end of a range of estimates.  We rate the claim Mostly False.  MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",/factchecks/2020/jun/16/facebook-posts/widely-shared-facebook-posts-mislead-covid-19-mort/

VP Mike Pence says Oklahoma flattened the COVID-19 curve. That’s False
","President Donald Trump is receiving criticism for his decision to restart in-person, indoor rallies with an event in Tulsa on June 20. During a White House roundtable on June 15, Vice President Mike Pence defended Trump’s decision by praising Oklahoma’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. At a discussion of issues affecting older Americans, Pence said, ""The president and I have both spoken to (Oklahoma) Gov. Kevin Stitt in the last several days and even earlier today. And Oklahoma has really been in the forefront of our efforts to slow the spread. And in a very real sense, they've flattened the curve. And today, their hospital capacity is abundant. The number of cases in Oklahoma — it's declined precipitously, and we feel very confident going forward with the rally this coming weekend."" However, Pence’s remarks represent an unduly optimistic reading of Oklahoma’s actual coronavirus data. (The Trump campaign and the White House did not respond to inquiries.) The state opened some businesses on April 24 and others on May 1. We looked at the raw data for Oklahoma from the Covid Tracking Project. The following chart shows both the daily number of new, confirmed cases in Oklahoma and the seven-day rolling average, which smooths out day-to-day variations in the data. (For instance, weekends often show artificially low totals because offices are closed.)   The strongest evidence for Pence’s characterization comes in the early part of the period. From early March to early April, the daily case count skyrocketed, but then it eased and remained more or less in check through the end of May.  This fits the pattern of ""flattening the curve,"" a term that gained currency early in the pandemic to describe a hoped-for phenomenon by which Americans would stay at home to stop the virus’ spread, thus keeping new infections from overwhelming the hospital system. However, Pence overstated the case. First, it’s incorrect to say that infections in Oklahoma ""declined precipitously."" As the chart shows, it was, at best, a modest decline between early April and the end of May. It could be more accurately described as a plateau. Second, any ""flattening the curve"" period is old news. Over the most recent week, the number of new cases has increased every day and produced a spike beyond anything previously seen in Oklahoma. The seven-day rolling average for new infections is now more than double where it stood at the end of May, just before the spike began. ""It looks from the data that the number of cases is on the rise, and rising quite steeply,"" said Nicole Gatto, associate professor in the School of Community and Global Health at Claremont Graduate University. Tara C. Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University, agreed. ""The seven-day average doesn't look great for the most recent part of June,"" Smith said. ""They had slowed new cases for a while, but the trend now seems to be reversing."" Equally important, the recent spike does not appear to be traceable to a big surge in testing. Here’s a chart of the seven-day rolling average of daily tests in Oklahoma: The number of tests conducted has generally risen over time. But the number of tests actually fell during the period when the number of new infections was spiking.  Pence said, ""In a very real sense, (Oklahoma has) flattened the curve. ... The number of cases in Oklahoma — it's declined precipitously."" This observation is outdated and inaccurate. In June, Oklahoma’s daily caseload has risen consistently, and to levels higher than at any point in the pandemic.

Doug Pederson and the truth about two-point conversions
","The Eagles missed a two-point conversion with four seconds left in Sunday’s game against the Ravens that would have given them a likely victory. Carson Wentz threw an incomplete pass over the middle to wide receiver Jordan Matthews, and fans and media wondered why they didn’t even have running back Ryan Mathews on the field.   ""Your chances of throwing it,"" coach Doug Pederson said afterwards, ""are actually a little bit better in that situation."" The last few years in the NFL, teams have thrown on two-point conversions far more often than they have run. But is that really the smart decision? Do you have a better a chance of converting a two-point conversion on a pass than a throw? Let’s start by confirming Pederson is not alone in favoring the pass. In regular season games since 2012, according to Pro Football Reference, teams have gone for two 366 times. They have passed the ball 275 of those times, a 75 percent rate. Teams have been successful on 132 of the passing attempts, 48 percent. That’s pretty good, and statisticians have been saying for years teams should go for two more often. But for rushing the ball, conversion rates are even better. Since 2012, 48 of the 91 two-point conversion rushing attempts, 53 percent, have been successful.       Pederson, perhaps more than anyone, should know rushing the ball can be effective on a two-point conversion. Though the sample size is tiny, the Eagles ran the ball three times up the middle this year for a two-pointer. They were successful each time, including early in Sunday’s game. Pederson talked more about his decision during a press conference Monday, saying he correctly assumed the Ravens would stack the box for this late-game situation, making it a difficult running play. According to Football Outsiders, the Ravens’ defense ranks No. 2 in the league in short-yardage running plays. Mathews had dominated the Ravens for much of the game, rushing for 128 yards on 20 carries.     ""Listen, there was zero, in my mind, opportunity to run,"" he said. ""Because what we anticipated is what we got defensively. They gapped out. They zero blitzed us. There was not going to be a lane. It was going to be a one-yard loss if we tried to run the football at that time."" He continued, ""I know what we did the first two-point conversion. It was in the first half of the game when really I decided to go for two then because of the weather. I didn’t want to take points off the board necessarily with a potential missed extra point with the way we were kicking into the wind at that time. So, that’s a different situation, different scenario. This was a true, got-to-have-it situation and we had our best play at that time against that defense."" In the fourth quarter this year teams have been even more likely to pass the ball on two-point attempts, throwing 52 times compared to running 10 times. But those who’ve tried running have often been successful, converting seven of 10 fourth-quarter rushing attempts. In the last five years, teams using rush plays on two-point conversions in the fourth quarter have been successful 56 percent of the time. Teams passing the ball in the same timeframe on two-point conversions have been successful 46 percent of the time.  Through a spokesperson, Pederson declined to discuss further justification for his decision or evidence for why he believed the chances of throwing it are better than running. Our ruling Eagles coach Doug Pederson chose to pass the ball on a two-point conversion that would have likely won Sunday’s game against the Baltimore Ravens. He didn’t even have running back Ryan Mathews on the field and explained ""your chances of throwing it are actually a little bit better in that situation."" The last five years of two-point conversion data show otherwise. Teams have converted 53 percent of running attempts on two-point conversions, compared to 48 percent of passing attempts. Pederson may have been right to throw against the Ravens, but his justification for his decision was wrong.

"['Illinois', 'David Menchetti']","
Illinois, Indiana work comp law: Same words, different results
","One of the hottest and most divisive topics in Illinois politics for the last 18 months has been workers’ compensation reform. Gov. Bruce Rauner and business groups say the state’s workers’ compensation system is unfairly biased against employers and has led, in the most recent national report, to Illinois having the eighth highest workers’ compensation insurance rates in the nation. Two dominant themes have emerged in the workers’ compensation debate. One is that Indiana has been a magnet for Illinois business relocations because it has very low workers’ compensation insurance rates. The other is that Illinois has high rates because of the state’s ""no-fault"" workers’ compensation system. Any injury ""arising out of and in the course of employment"" is compensable with workers’ compensation benefits, including medical care and paid time off for recovery. In legal terms, Illinois has no-fault standard of ""causation."" Thus, a pre-existing condition that is aggravated in the course of work is covered under workers’ compensation. Given all this, a statement made during an Illinois House committee hearing on a workers’ compensation reform bill might have struck an odd chord. ""The causation standard in Indiana is exactly the same as it is in Illinois,"" said David Menchetti, a labor attorney with the Chicago firm Cullen Haskins Nicholson Menchetti. Menchetti testified at the hearing in opposition to the bill, which would change Illinois’ causation standard to the one described in Rauner’s reform agenda. If Indiana is attracting businesses away from Illinois because of its low workers’ compensation insurance premiums, and if Illinois’ no-fault causation standard is the cause of its high insurance rates, could Indiana really have the same legal standard as Illinois? We decided to check. Turnaround Rauner’s Turnaround Agenda contains a section devoted solely to enhancing the state’s causation standard, and he has spoken extensively about the need to switch to a standard in which workers’ compensation benefits aren’t granted unless the workplace is ""more than 50 percent responsible for the injury compared to all other causes."" He’s also been vocal about Illinois losing jobs and businesses to Indiana because of, among other things, Illinois’ high workers’ compensation insurance premiums. ""We should be kickin’ tails, and look what’s happening to us,"" Rauner said in a speech in August at the Illinois State Fair. ""Our jobs are going to Indiana. Come on. They’re going to Indiana. They ain’t going there for the weather."" Rauner is not the first to invoke the state’s causation standard as problematic for businesses. In a 2012 brief, Attorney General Lisa Madigan wrote, ""To protect taxpayer dollars, the legislature must address and change the causation standard that is currently applied by the IWCC and the courts."" The attorney general’s office, however, has never advocated for a specific standard and has not issued an official opinion on Rauner’s proposal. ""From our perspective, there ought to be reasonable ways to change the standard that would not damage the purpose of workers’ compensation to ensure that employees who are injured on the job can fully recover,"" Madigan’s chief of staff, Anne Spillane, told Politifact Illinois in September. The codes The Illinois Workers’ Compensation Act invokes the term ""arising from and in the course of"" employment seven times in defining injuries subject to workers’ compensation. Likewise, the Indiana Workers’ Compensation code (ICC 22-3-6-1-[e]) defines ""injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment"" as compensable under the state’s workers’ compensation system. By contrast, Florida -- whose causation standard Rauner wants to replicate in Illinois -- adds a conditional clause in its code: ""If an injury arising out of and in the course of employment combines with a preexisting disease or condition to cause or prolong disability or need for treatment, the employer must pay compensation or benefits required by this chapter only to the extent that the injury arising out of and in the course of employment is and remains more than 50 percent responsible for the injury as compared to all other causes combined and thereafter remains the major contributing cause of the disability or need for treatment. Major contributing cause must be demonstrated by medical evidence only."" (440.09 [b]) But if Indiana and Illinois have identical causation standards in their workers’ compensation statutes, why are Indiana’s insurance premiums so much cheaper than those paid by businesses in Illinois? Menchetti cites two primary reasons. One is that Indiana pays significantly lower workers’ compensation benefits. The other, he says, is that employers in Indiana, not injured employees, have first choice in medical treatment. A national compilation of workers’ compensation laws by the Workers’ Compensation Research Institute confirms that the initial choice of treating physician in Indiana lies with the employer, while in Illinois the choice is the employee. A 2015 report by nonprofit, investigative journalism website ProPublica shows that, on benefits for permanent partial disability, Illinois consistently paid more than the national average while Indiana generally was close to average. (Compensation for loss of an arm in Illinois, for example, is $439,858. The national average is $169,878, and Indiana pays $202,050.) More than just causation While the statutes in Indiana and Illinois may use the same definition for causation, how the law is interpreted and applied makes the difference on cost, says Michael Lucci, who has studied workers’ compensation and written extensively about it for the libertarian Illinois Policy Institute, which favors Rauner’s reform agenda. ""I think the difference you’ll find is largely subject to judicial interpretation and arbitration rulings,"" Lucci says. ""Causation is a difficult issue. We haven’t engaged particularly hard on this issue."" In a recent analysis, Lucci offered a seven-point plan for reducing Illinois’ workers’ compensation insurance premiums. Changing the causation standard was not among them. The difference between eighth-most-expensive Illinois and second-least-expensive Indiana for workers’ compensation insurance, Lucci says, can’t be bridged by changing the causation wording alone. ""Their arbitrators have a narrower view of what constitutes a workplace injury,"" Lucci says. Our ruling Attorney David Menchetti testified before the Illinois House Labor and Commerce Committee that, ""The causation standard in Indiana is exactly the same as it is in Illinois."" State workers’ compensation statutes in both states confirm that Indiana and Illinois both are ""no-fault"" states in which an injury need only happen in the workplace to be covered by workers’ compensation. Both define qualifying injuries as those as those arising from employment with no other conditions. As noted in statements from Menchetti and Lucci -- who are on opposite sides of the larger workers’ compensation reform issue -- the causation standard’s effect on workers’ compensation insurance rates is open to debate. The standard itself in Illinois and Indiana statutes is not. We rate this statement True.  ",/factchecks/2016/dec/19/david-menchetti/illinois-indiana-work-comp-law-same-words-differen/

Is California's economy 'growing a hell of a lot faster' than Texas?
","Stoking their long-running feud, California Gov. Jerry Brown recently jabbed at former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, saying Golden State is ""growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas."" Brown made this claim in the middle of an impassioned defense of climate change science at the American Geophysical Union conference on Dec. 14, 2016 in San Francisco. ""We’ve proved in California that the economy grows. And it grows in part because of the climate rules that we’ve adopted,"" Brown said. Perry, a climate change skeptic, was recently selected U.S. energy secretary by President-elect Trump. While Texas governor, he repeatedly visited California in an attempt to lure jobs to the Lone Star State, with the promise of less regulation and lower costs. In his speech, Brown said Perry’s critiques about California’s job-killing red tape don’t hold up. ""Now remember our new secretary of energy, he was coming to California to say: ‘Come to Texas because we have all the jobs in Texas."" ""Well, Rick: I got some news for you, California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas, and we have more sun than you have oil!""  Gov. Jerry Brown makes his claim about California ""growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas"" at about the 13:00 minute mark in the video above.  With Brown’s reference of Perry, we took his ""faster than Texas"" claim to mean faster economic growth with a focus on jobs. We decided to zero-in on job growth rates in California and Texas, while also weighing GDP and unemployment trends in the states. We’ll leave the fun comparison of sunshine to oil for Brown and Perry to wrestle with another day. Our research We concede there’s no definition for what ""a hell of a lot faster"" growth looks like. Still, we’ll do our best to sort out the governor’s claim. Brown’s spokeswoman pointed us to several news articles detailing California’s recent economic improvements. Looking solely at 2015 job growth rates, Brown’s claim appears to hold up. In that year, California added 483,000 jobs, posting a jobs growth rate of 3 percent, based on data we crunched from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That pace was twice as fast as Texas’ 1.5 percent job growth rate. California’s rapid employment gains have slowed somewhat to about 2 percent this year through November. That may not qualify as ""a hell of a lot faster,"" but it’s still greater than Texas’ roughly 1.6 percent job growth rate so far this year. The business website Kiplinger.com forecast California would rank 10th in the nation among states for fastest job growth in 2016. It noted that Texas was not on its Top 10 list. It wasn’t long ago, however, that Texas outpaced California. In 2014, Texas recorded a 3.7 percent job growth rate, ahead of California’s 2.9 percent pace. Looking to the future, California’s job gains may slow. The closely watched UCLA Anderson Forecast predicts jobs to grow by only 1.5 percent in the state during 2017 and just 0.8 percent in 2018. Because Brown used the phrase ""is growing,"" we’ll judge him on the most recent figures, not future forecasts. Overall economy While the pace of job growth is important, it’s not the only measurement of a state’s economic health. And Brown’s claim could be interpreted as California’s overall economy, not just jobs, is growing much faster than the economy in Texas. In August, PolitiFact Texas took a deep look at the economies of both California and Texas to evaluate a June claim by Julián Castro, the U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development, that ""Today, California is kicking our butt, creating more jobs and more economic growth than Texas."" It rated the claim True, citing greater jobs, per capita income and GDP growth rates in California. It noted Texas had a lower jobless rate. Building on that fact check, we looked at the most recent economic figures for both states to see if the assessment still holds. We found that California’s GDP grew faster than Texas’ in the first two quarters of this year, at rates of 2 percent and most recently 2.2 percent compared with Texas’ 1.3 percent and its most recent quarter, a negative 0.8 percent, according to a news release in December by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. It was a different story in 2015 when Texas’ GDP expanded by 4.8 percent (a figure that was recently revised upward) compared with California’s 3.8 percent GDP expansion. Comparing unemployment rates, Texas, at 4.6 percent in November, has consistently fared better than California, where the rate was 5.3 percent in November, and has hovered well above 5 percent this year. California had one more economic bright spot in 2015: Per capita personal income grew at twice the rate as in Texas, 5.4 percent to 2.6 percent, according to federal data. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown recently claimed ""California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas."" We took this to mean economic growth with a focus on the pace of job creation. California’s 3 percent job growth rate in 2015, which doubled Texas’ pace, definitely fits into Brown's colorful claim. But California’s rate has slowed to about 2 percent so far this year, closer to Texas’ 1.6 job growth rate. Other economic metrics show California faring better than Texas in several, though not all, categories: California’s GDP expanded faster than Texas’ GDP in the first two quarters of this year, though Texas had a faster GDP growth rate in 2015. Also, per capita income grew twice as fast in California as Texas in 2015, also backing Brown’s statement. Texas, however, has consistently held a lower jobless rate than California in recent years.   Brown, like the state’s economy in recent years, is on the right track. And while California has expanded jobs and its economy faster than Texas in many cases, there are a few cases where that growth has been strong but not necessarily ""a hell of a lot faster."" We rate Brown’s statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/158c502a-4b3e-463d-906f-529da13e2451",/factchecks/2016/dec/19/jerry-brown/are-jobs-california-growing-hell-lot-faster-texas/

Bryce Reeves says single mom can make almost $50,000 a year on public dole
","State Sen. Bryce Reeves is running in a crowded Republican primary field for lieutenant governor on a small-government platform. ""My goal, as lieutenant governor, is to reform taxes, help to get people off of welfare,"" Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, said on ""The John Fredericks Show"" radio program. ""If you’re a single mom and you have two kids in the city of Richmond, you can almost make $50,000 a year on the public dole."" We wondered whether that single mom in Richmond really could receive so much public assistance. Reeves’ claim is based on a report by the Virginia Department of Social Services that examines the ""road to self-sufficiency"" taken by a fictitious Richmond mom with two boys, ages 3 and 7, as she gradually works toward a higher income level where she can pay completely for her family’s basic needs without relying on public assistance. She starts out working 40 hours a week at a minimum-wage job, earning $15,080 a year. The Department of Social Services provided us a chart showing the public assistance she’d receive at that wage level for a year: •Welfare, $3,840 •Food stamps, $2,268 •Women Infants and Children food basket, $600 •Child care assistance, $12,468 •School lunch, $1,296 •Housing voucher, $10,692 All of that assistance comes to $31,164 a year. That doesn’t include the value of medical benefits the three-person family would get. Necole Simmonds, a Department of Social Services spokeswoman, told us in an email that the mom might be eligible for Medicaid while her children would be eligible for FAMIS Plus, a medical insurance program for children in low-income families. We asked about the cost of providing the fictitious Richmond family with medical insurance. Simmonds pointed us to estimates by the Kaiser Family Foundation of per-capita Medicaid spending in Virginia in 2011 - the latest year available. It came to $4,411 for an adult and $2,698 per child. These are not ideal figures because they’re bit old and, as we noted, the kids would be insured by FAMIS Plus, not Medicaid. The Department of Social Services couldn’t provide an estimate on per-capita benefits from FAMIS Plus. Despite these issues, the figures provide an approximation of the cost of publicly funded medical services for the fictitious family. And when we add the medical costs to the other benefits listed above, the family would be receiving close to $40,000 in total public assistance - short of the figure Reeves cited. Simmonds told us in an email that ""the total value of the benefits a woman with two young kids making minimum wage may receive does not add up to $50,000."" When we reached out to Reeves’ campaign, a spokeswoman told us the senator misspoke and said Reeves was not trying to suggest that the single mom would be getting nearly $50,000 from the public dole. ""What he was trying to say was: ‘If you’re a single mom, and you’ve two kids in the city of Richmond, you almost have to make $50,000 a year to get off the public dole,"" Sam Azzarelli, communications director for the Reeves campaign, wrote us in an email. There are some problems with this amended claim that we also should point out, even though it’s not the focus of this fact-check. The fictitious mother loses most of her public assistance by the time she’s earning $33,800. At that point she no longer qualifies for welfare, food stamps, child care and housing assistance. As a result, she’s left with an income that leaves her hundreds of dollars short each month of meeting her family’s basic needs. The only major benefit her family continues to get is medical assistance for her two children, and that ends when her income reaches $42,120. But the family is not self-sufficient at this point and won’t be, according to the Department of Social Services report, until the mother is earning $50,440. At that earning level, the mother is able to pay all of the basic expenses of housing, food, child care, health care and transportation. Our ruling Reeves said, ""If you’re a single mom, and you’ve two kids in the city of Richmond, you can almost make $50,000 a year on the public dole."" Although Reeves acknowledges he misspoke, he wasn’t far off. That mother, if she was working full time at minimum wage, could receive about $40,000 a year in public assistance. So we rate Reeves’ statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/dec/19/bryce-reeves/bryce-reeves-says-single-mom-can-make-almost-50000/

Schaefer's claims of UM System funding fall short
","In a full-page ad published on Nov. 13 in the Columbia Daily Tribune, Republican state Sen. Kurt Schaefer took credit for boosting University of Missouri System funding. In the ad, Schaefer, who represents Boone County, touted his accomplishments as the chair of the Missouri legislature’s Senate Appropriations committee. Schaefer is wrapping up his second four-year term in the Senate. Barred by term limits from serving another term, he ran for attorney general but lost in the primary election to Josh Hawley. ""I was able to make sure that the University of Missouri, Boone County, and Columbia received much needed funding on a number of important projects,"" he wrote. Among his listed achievements was increased funding for the UM System. Schaefer wrote that he helped secure the largest amount of state funding for the four-campus system in the last two years since 2008. Is he correct? We decided to check it out. By the numbers Schaefer cites two amounts for the legislature’s appropriations to the UM System: $434 million for fiscal year 2016 and $448 million for fiscal year 2017. In 2008, the legislature appropriated $431 million to the system’s operating budget. So, technically, funding has increased. But Schaefer did not take into account inflation or rising enrollment over time. In today’s dollars, 2008's appropriations to the UM System total $474 million. That’s a lot more than the legislature allotted for the past two years. Moreover, enrollment has increased. In the fall of 2015, the total enrollment for the UM System was 59,807 full-time students. The fall of 2015 coincides with fiscal year 2016. Enrollment for 2016 dropped slightly: 57,778 students. By comparison, enrollment in 2008 was 51,012 students. That means that in 2008, state-appropriated dollars per student totaled $9,300, after the amounts are adjusted for inflation. In 2015, the amount per student was significantly lower – $7,256 — a 22 percent decrease. A contentious relationship Schaefer was an outspoken critic of the UM System following student protests at MU last year. The protests, which began after students said administrators failed to address racism on campus, culminated in the resignation of then-UM System President Tim Wolfe in November 2015. Schaefer lambasted MU’s handling of Melissa Click, a professor who stoked tension on the day of Wolfe’s resignation when she asked for ""some muscle"" to remove a student journalist from a protest. In January, Schaefer and more 100 other legislators signed letters urging the UM System Board of Curators to fire Click. The curators voted to fire her in February. He also proposed a legislative commission this year to scrutinize the UM System’s structure, including its diversity programs. Angry about a lack of university leadership during the protests, legislators advocated cutting the UM System’s budget. Schaefer supported that effort, though he took strides to lessen the proposed cuts. The legislature cut appropriations to the system by $3.8 million for fiscal year 2017. Our ruling Schaefer praised his work on the Senate Appropriations Committee, citing increased funding for the UM System as one of his accomplishments. But it’s clear from the data that state funding has not kept pace with rising inflation. In reality, state funding for the UM System has decreased considerably since 2008, despite what Schaefer wrote in his ad. We rate his claim Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2016/dec/19/kurt-schaefer/schaefers-claims-um-system-funding-fall-short/

"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Kirk Watson']","
Kirk Watson says average Austin homeowner pays $1,300 to $1,400 that goes to other school districts
","For years, Austin taxpayers have indirectly helped fund schools elsewhere in accord with the state’s more than 20-year-old system for equalizing aid among school districts, some of which have vast differences in taxable property wealth. Kirk Watson, the Democratic state senator from Travis County, attached an ear-catching figure to those costs during a November 2016 Texas Tribune panel discussion about hot issues in the 2017 legislative session. ""In Austin, Texas,"" Watson said, ""the average homeowner is paying about $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture,"" as in funds shifted to less property-rich districts elsewhere. ""And so that’s going to the state to fund state obligations. We have got to look at how we’re doing our school finance system so that we can do right by the people in this state and have a fair and equitable system."" We asked Watson’s office how he arrived at his figure for how much average Austin homeowners are paying to schools elsewhere. By email, Kate Alexander said Watson relied on September 2016 testimony by the Austin school district’s chief financial officer. According to Nicole Conley's prepared remarks for a Sept. 28, 2016, appearance at a joint hearing of the Texas House committees on appropriations and public education, Conley described the Austin school district as the state’s largest single payer of recapture. ""Our payment alone comprises 13 percent of all state collections,"" Conley’s testimony says. ""During the next five years—between fiscal years 2016 and 2020—Austin ISD is projected to pay almost $2.6 billion in recapture payments to the state. By 2019, more than half of every tax dollar collected in Austin will go to the state."" Later in her testimony: Conley said: ""So to put it in perspective, we could lower our tax rate by 35 cents if we weren’t sending $406 million to the state under the recapture system. For the average homeowner in Austin, that would amount to about $1,400 in lower taxes. That’s fairly substantial; that’s pretty significant tax relief. That would certainly make Austin more affordable for some of our taxpayers."" To our inquiry, district spokesman Jacob Barrett told us Conley reached her savings figure for the average homeowner starting from the district’s 2016-17 budget indicating it expects to pay $406 million in recapture to the state in accord with the school funding system. That payment amounts to 38 percent of the district’s $1.061 billion in budgeted property taxes, Barrett noted. Barrett said the district got to the average homeowner’s share of the budgeted recapture payment starting from its average taxable value of a home in the district of $328,844 (as of June 2016) on which such an owner expected to pay $3,548 in school maintenance and operations property taxes at the M&O tax rate of $1.079 per $100 valuation. Finally, Barrett said, multiplying the 38 percent by that $3,548 delivers the portion of taxes on an average-value residence that goes to recapture of $1,355. Barrett also emailed us a December 2012 district document showing that by amount, the Austin district's 2015 recapture payment was followed by what was paid by the Highland Park (Dallas); Eanes; Cotulla; and Karnes City districts, respectively. Also, the document says, the Austin district’s annual recapture payment is projected to exceed $630 million in 2019 when ""more than half of every school property tax dollar collected locally will be ‘recaptured’ by the state."" Next, we asked non-district experts--Joe Wisnoski, a former Texas Education Agency official; Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials; and Christy Rome, who advocates for districts required to make recapture payments--to evaluate how the Austin district determined the average Austin homeowner will pay $1,355 in school property taxes toward the district’s 2016-17 recapture total. Solid, each expert said. By email, Wisnoski cautioned though: ""The average doesn’t really describe much about the distribution of payment amounts, so you don’t really know how many taxpayers are clustered close to that amount, and how many are really far away (high or low) compared to the average."" Finally, we looked into how much a district resident with the median value home might be paying toward its recapture total. For that, we ran the median value of homes in the Austin district as of Aug. 8, 2016--$261,487--through the district’s equation. Result: The median-value homeowner will be expected to pay $2,821 in M&O school taxes, of which $1,078 would be her or his share of the district’s recapture payment. Barrett, the district spokesman, didn’t question our math. He noted, though, that Watson referred to ""the average homeowner."" It’s fair, Barrett said by email, ""to use the variable that we do.""   Our ruling Watson said the average Austin homeowner pays about $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture, as in funds ultimately spent in other districts. By the Austin district’s analysis, the owners of a home at the district’s average taxable value for 2016-17 stands to pay $1,355 in school property taxes toward the district’s more than $400 million recapture payment for the year.

"['Economy', 'Taxes', 'New York', 'Andrew Cuomo']","
Most taxes are lower since Cuomo was elected
","Andrew M. Cuomo targeted high taxes when he announced his candidacy for New York governor. ""We’re tired of seeing New Yorkers leave the state because they can’t pay their taxes anymore,"" Cuomo said at his May 2010 announcement. Now, more than halfway into his second term, Cuomo says he’s kept his promise to lower taxes. ""I’ve spent less than every other governor and when you spend less you can cut taxes. Taxes for every New Yorker are lower today than when I started,"" Cuomo said during a recent speech in Fishkill. ""Corporate taxes are down to the level they were at in 1968. Middle-class taxes are down to the level they were at in 1947. Manufacturing taxes are down to the level they were at in 1917."" Is Cuomo right? Are taxes for every New Yorker lower? Personal income taxes Income taxes are lower for earners at all wage levels compared with 2010, according to the state Department of Budget. From the highest-income residents to couples earning less than about $40,000 annually, tax rates are lower, though not dramatically for the highest earners. A married couple making more than roughly $2.1 million is taxed at an 8.82 percent rate, down from 8.97 percent. In 2010, married couples making $500,000 were taxed at 8.97 percent. Now, married couples making between roughly $320,000 and $2.1 million are taxed at 6.85 percent. For couples earning less than about $40,000 annually, the tax rate has stayed the same since 2010, ranging from 5.9 percent to 4 percent for the lowest earners. The Department of Budget says deductions have increased for those earners despite the flat rate. Deductions have been indexed to inflation since Cuomo and the legislature passed new tax law in 2011. That means deductions should be larger for anyone in this wage category who earns the same amount in 2015 as in 2011. The same is true for single filers. The tax rate has decreased for anyone making more than about $20,000 annually. The rate has stayed the same for anyone making less than that, though deductions are indexed to inflation for these filers as well. Business income taxes Manufacturers were taxed on income at a rate of 5.9 percent in 2010. That same tax has now been reduced to 0 percent according to the Department of Budget. Manufacturers also receive a 20 percent real property tax credit if they own or lease property. Corporate taxes are also lower. In 2010, the corporate net income tax was 7.1 percent. Now, it’s 6.5 percent. Property taxes Property taxes statewide continue to rise despite a state imposed cap. Most municipalities are not able to raise property taxes more than 2 percent without voter approval. The Department of Budget says the property tax bill for a typical taxpayer is more than the state income tax amount. A report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy shows a resident's income level determines which tax hits the hardest. School taxes rose in the four years following the cap’s implementation in 2012, according to the Empire Center for Public Policy. School taxes are usually the largest part of a municipality’s property tax bill. The level of state aid to schools affects how much districts raise in property taxes. The rate at which these taxes increased is lower now than it was four years ago. Before the tax cap, the average property tax increase was 5.3 percent a year. The average increase was 2.2 percent in the first three years after the cap took effect, according to a report from the state. Sales tax The first 4 percentage points of sales taxes are levied by the state. Anything beyond that is levied by counties or cities. Increases in the local portion beyond 3 percent must be approved by the state Legislature and signed by the governor. The state portion of sales taxes has been unchanged since Cuomo took office. But the local portion has increased in seven counties, each time with state approval. The Essex County sales tax rate, for example, increased from 3.75 percent to 4 percent in 2013. Our ruling ""Taxes for every New Yorker are lower today than when I started,"" Cuomo said during an event in Fishkill. If Cuomo had said income taxes for every New Yorker are now lower, he would have been right. It’s true that income taxes for individuals, corporations, and manufacturers are lower than when he took office in 2011. Although the Cuomo administration has slowed property tax growth through a state-imposed cap, property taxes continue to increase for residents. And the property tax takes a bigger bite than the income tax for many residents.  Also, the state has also approved some sales tax increases at the county level since Cuomo took office.

"['Energy', 'Illinois', 'Jeanne Ives']","
In Illinois energy debate, Ives' German anecdote is Mostly True
","On Dec. 1, the last day of the fall veto session, the Illinois General Assembly passed a controversial bill that provides $2.35 billion in ratepayer-funded subsidies to prevent two Exelon-owned nuclear power plants from closing. The legislation also includes up to $220 million a year in funding for the development of renewable energy resources like wind and solar, a provision that won over environmental advocates because it beefs up the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard. While the Future Energy Jobs Bill garnered strong bipartisan support and was signed by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner the following week, 56 lawmakers voted against it, with many arguing it would result in higher energy prices. During a floor debate, one of these opponents, state Rep. Jeanne Ives, R-Wheaton, lamented that the bill ignored the free market and favored special interests, including huge profitable corporations and green energy companies. Ives argued the strengthened wind and solar mandates within the legislation would drive up energy prices and wouldn’t improve the environment. As an example, she pointed to Germany, a country widely hailed as a world leader in renewable energy production. ""Germany managed to increase its use of renewables and its output of carbon dioxide at the same time — because it resorted to cheap coal to keep the lights on at a price its people could afford,"" she said. Does Ives’ statement hold true? We checked the record to find out. Cost of clean energy  Ives, who argues the energy overhaul ignores the the movement away from wind and solar in Europe, cited an April op-ed in the Wall Street Journal by business columnist Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., who’s also a member of the newspaper’s editorial board. The statement Ives made on the House floor is practically identical to what Jenkins writes. In the article, Jenkins claims the reason Germany saw an increase in carbon emissions despite boosting its use of renewables is because wind and solar are ""only competitive to the extent that fossil-fuel plants remain on hand to provide backup power"" when the wind isn’t blowing or the sun isn’t shining. Jenkins then addresses the ""fight"" happening in many states across the United States, saying it ""concerns the exorbitant costs imposed on other ratepayers to subsidize backup power for solar adopters."" Ives also provided a link to a report by the Institute of Political Economy at Utah State University, which includes a case study about Germany’s solar industry. However, it should be noted one of the authors, Randy Simmons, has ties to the fossil fuel industry and the oil-based conglomerate Koch Industries, which has been accused of trying to undermine the nation’s clean energy push through lobbying efforts.   According to the study, Germany’s residential electricity prices increased by about 50 percent between 1998 and 2015, in part because of subsidies provided to renewables like solar. The authors note Germany has begun to phase out solar subsidies because of high costs, despite solar being the country’s desired goal for its energy portfolio. ""The German government is not alone in paying large sums of money on behalf of solar power. Because solar power is intermittent, traditional electricity producers have had to make substantial changes to their plants to handle the fluctuating electricity demands,"" according to the report. A November 2015 article published in The Economist about Germany’s energy market, explains that because electricity generated by wind and solar is free at the margin, ""green-power producers offer it for next to nothing in wholesale markets."" The next-lowest bids typically come from nuclear power stations, followed by lignite (brown) coal-burning plants, hard coal and then gas-fired power stations.   Energy companies begin accepting the lowest bids and once the day’s requirement has been filled, successful bidders are paid the highest price required to clear the market, according to the article.    ""The surge of solar and wind power is pushing down the clearing price and bending Germany’s energy market out of shape. Power stations burning natural gas increasingly find no takers for their electricity, so they sit idle,"" reports The Economist. ""Meanwhile the cheap, carboniferous lignite power stations burn on."" Carbon causes  Despite renewables accounting for one-third of power generation in 2015, Germany saw a 1.1 percent increase, or 10 million tonnes, in carbon dioxide emissions when compared to 2014, according to the think tank Green Budget Germany. A higher demand for heating oil and diesel due to cooler temperatures, as well as the use of lignite coal for power generation, were attributed to the slight rise in CO2 emissions. However, the reason dirty coal continues to comprise a significant portion of Germany’s energy portfolio dates back to a social movement and government program against nuclear power that began in the 1970s called the Energiewende, which means ""energy transition."" The movement was reinvigorated by the Chernobyl accident in 1986, and then again by Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011. In the wake of Fukushima, Germany set an aggressive goal to phase out all nuclear power plants by 2022, while boosting its use of renewables and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels. Andrew Barbeau, a senior energy consultant for the Environmental Defense Fund who played an instrumental role in negotiating and crafting the Exelon bill, said there is a ""huge corollary"" between Illinois and Germany. Barbeau, who recently was in Germany, said Ives’ statement brings up about two-thirds of what’s happening with regard to the country’s energy transition.   ""It’s a lot about carbon, it’s a lot about fossil fuels, but it’s more about getting rid of nuclear,"" Barbeau said. ""What the environmental groups have been saying… is if you close nuclear plants prematurely without having enough renewables on the grid to replace them, then you’re going to see new coal and gas plants built."" Part of the reasoning around the Exelon bill, Barbeau says, was to keep the nuclear plants online until there is enough renewable capacity on the grid to replace them so no new coal- and gas-fired power stations have to be built. ""The large driver of those carbon emissions -- and this is what was very clear to the environmental organizations involved in the Illinois debate -- is if you get rid of nuclear too soon, then all of a sudden you have new coal and gas, and carbon emissions will go up,"" Barbeau said. ""And that’s exactly what happened in Germany."" Like in southern Illinois where coal provides 40 percent of electricity for consumers, coal comprises 42 percent of power generation in Germany, and thousands of Germans are employed in lignite coal mines. In March 2015, attempts to regulate lignite-burning power stations through carbon taxes were met with fierce opposition from miners and others within the coal industry. Instead, German officials this past spring decided to mothball and decommission eight lignite power stations while compensating plant operators for lost profits. Germany’s federal economics and energy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said this will allow the country to take 13 percent of lignite coal capacity off the market in the coming years, and help meet its carbon emissions target, reports Clean Energy Wire. Our ruling State Rep. Jeanne Ives said, ""Germany managed to increase its use of renewables and its output of carbon dioxide at the same time because it resorted to cheap coal to keep the lights on at a price its people could afford."" In 2015, renewable energy accounted for nearly one-third of Germany’s total electricity generation, compared to 25.9 percent in 2014. During this same time period, carbon dioxide emissions rose slightly by 1.1 percent. While subsidies for wind and solar is part of the reason Germany’s residential consumers have seen electricity prices rise 50 percent between 1998 and 2015, the country’s aggressive push to eliminate nuclear energy by 2022 has been the main driver behind the coal and carbon comeback. Prematurely closing down nuclear power plants without having enough renewables on the grid to replace them led to an uptick in the use of lignite coal and therefore carbon emissions. As of 2015, coal supplied Germany with 40 percent of its power total power generation, even though renewables’ share surged to 30 percent.   This statement is accurate, but requires additional context about Germany’s energy transition.

Pants on Fire! Trump tweet about White House, Russian hacking probe
","President-elect Donald Trump continues to question whether the Russian government tried to interfere in the U.S. election. Trump has said it could have been China who hacked emails of Democratic operatives and the Democratic National Committee. Or someone ""sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds."" And if it is the Russians, why did the White House wait so long to act? Trump asked on Twitter. ""If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?"" Trump tweeted early Dec. 15. If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost? Only that’s not true. The administration announced its findings a month before Election Day, and the White House’s announcement prompted a memorable exchange at the final presidential debate. Who’s the puppet?  On Oct. 7 — a few months after WikiLeaks released a trove of DNC emails, but the same day WikiLeaks released emails of Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta — President Barack Obama’s administration said it was confident Russia was behind the cyberattacks. ""The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations,"" read an Oct. 7 joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The U.S. Intelligence Community consists of 17 agencies and organizations within the executive branch, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence speaks on the group’s behalf. Their statement said releases of alleged hacked emails on DCLeaks.com and Wikileaks and by the online persona Guccifer 2.0 were ""consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts."" ""These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process,"" the statement said. ""Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities."" Clinton used the statement as ammo when she referred to Trump as Putin’s preferred ""puppet"" in the Oct. 19 presidential debate. (""No puppet, you’re the puppet,"" Trump replied.) When Clinton brought up the intelligence community’s statement, Trump said, ""She has no idea whether it is Russia, China or anybody else."" Post-election doubts After the election, Trump has been just as dismissive about Russian involvement. Regarding Russia’s involvement in the DNC email hack, Trump told Time magazine (which named him Person of the Year), ""I don’t believe it. I don’t believe they interfered."" On Dec. 12, Trump also questioned the timing of concerns about election-related hacks, tweeting, ""Unless you catch ‘hackers’ in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?"" Republican and Democratic leaders have raised concerns about Russia’s role in the election and have called for a congressional investigation. According to a New York Times investigation, Obama warned Putin about the cyberhacking and potential U.S. retaliation in person at the G-20 summit in China. The administration, however, chose to issue the joint written statement from Homeland Security and the national intelligence director rather than a more public rebuke from Obama. ""It was far less dramatic than the president’s appearance in the press room two years before to directly accuse the North Koreans of attacking Sony,"" the New York Times noted. Obama was aware of Russian hackers previously targeting the State Department, White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the New York Times reported, but he chose not to publicly call out Russians or issue sanctions out of ""fear of escalating a cyberwar, and concern that the United States needed Russia’s cooperation in negotiations over Syria."" Our ruling Trump tweeted, ""If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?"" About a month before the Nov. 8  election, the Obama administration accused Russia of interfering in the U.S. elections, directing the release of emails ""from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations."" This didn’t happen under the radar. Trump was confronted with it at the final presidential debate.

Website falsely claims Florida called for recount over voter fraud
","A website misleadingly claimed that the Sunshine State has pushed for a recount of presidential election results, citing widespread voter fraud. ""Florida Moves For FULL RECOUNT Of State Over Massive Voter Fraud,"" read the headline of a Dec. 6, 2016, post on BipartisanReport.com. While the post itself recounts a real news story about a lawsuit claiming voter fraud in Florida, the headline is inaccurate enough to give people the wrong impression that a potential recount is underway. The Tallahassee Democrat reported on Dec. 5 that three Florida residents had filed a lawsuit against President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and the state Cabinet and Florida’s 29 Republican electors. The website also cites the same story in the Detroit Free Press. The filing alleges that the state’s election results were invalid, contending that voting machines malfunctioned or were hacked, many votes went uncounted and mail-in ballots weren’t included, among other problems. The suit aims to force a recount of votes by insisting Hillary Clinton would have won the election had there been no alleged impropriety. Trump won Florida by almost 113,000 votes, and there has been no proof of ""massive voter fraud."" The election results were certified on Nov. 22, with only ""minor problems"" reported by election officials. Despite what the headline implies, state officials have not pushed for a recount. Under Florida law, a recount is triggered if a candidate wins by 0.5 percent or less. Trump’s margin of victory over Clinton was about 1.4 percent. A voter may file a lawsuit to contest the results within 10 days of the results being certified. The results can be contested if there’s a suspicion of fraud or corruption, a candidate being ineligible, a dispute over vote totals or bribery. With the assistance of a left-leaning Washington-based group called Protect Our Elections, the trio of plaintiffs filed their lawsuit on Dec. 2, the final eligible day to contest the results. The Facebook post of the report did mention the lawsuit, also noting ""Trump is NOT happy."" But there’s a good chance he won’t say anything about the lawsuit at all. Even Orlando attorney Clint Curtis, representing the plaintiffs in the recount lawsuit, acknowledged the action may produce zero results before the Electoral College votes on Dec. 19. ""They can ignore it entirely,"" Curtis told the Tallahassee Democrat. Our ruling Bipartisan Report’s headline read, ""Florida Moves For FULL RECOUNT Of State Over Massive Voter Fraud."" A trio of Florida voters contested the results, not state officials. Their lawsuit cited potential problems like uncounted or improperly tallied votes and voting machines that didn’t work or were hacked. The lawsuit likely won’t bring a recount — or any action at all — before the Electoral College votes. The headline confounds readers by misrepresenting what the story actually says.

"['Immigration', 'Homeland Security', 'PunditFact', 'Geraldo Rivera']","
Mostly False: Claim that tens of thousands of children are rushing the border fearing Trump's wall
","Fox News’ correspondent Geraldo Rivera said a wave of immigrants from Central America is hitting the United States ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Thousands of children and families have been apprehended at the southwest border in recent years as they try to flee violence and poverty in Central America, particularly in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. More attention should be given to Central America’s economic and safety issues, Rivera said. But he said another concern is also driving immigration to the United States: Trump’s promised border wall. ""You have a situation where you have all, tens of thousands of children being rushed across the border. Ironically ... why are they coming now? Why were there 45,000 last month as compared to a year ago?"" Rivera asked during a Dec. 12 interview on Fox News’ Hannity. ""They're coming because they fear the wall. They fear that the wall will start construction on Jan. 20, and they won’t be able to come and go the way they have been for decades."" We were curious about his statement that tens of thousands of children were rushing across the border before Trump takes office and builds a wall. While many children are coming across the border, it’s not at the level Rivera said, and there are other factors motivating them to come to the United States. ""I do not think that significant numbers of children are arriving at the border because they fear that the wall will hurt their future chances,"" said Denise Gilman, who directs the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law. ""I have personally spoken to many children and mothers who have arrived at the border and almost all are seeking refugee protection, in the form of asylum."" Our requests to Rivera for more information about his data went unanswered. November 2016 apprehension data not yet available Border apprehension data is frequently used as a measure of illegal entry into the United States. Rivera mentioned ""last month’s"" border crossings, which we took as November, but the latest information available goes through October 2016, the first month of fiscal year 2017. Immigration authorities in October caught 46,195 individuals of all nationalities along the southwest border. However, just 6,754 were younger than 18 years old. A total of 5,451 children were from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, according to border patrol data. ""Within these totals, we have seen corresponding increases in the numbers of unaccompanied children and individuals in families apprehended,"" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a November statement. ""We’ve also seen increases in the numbers of those who present themselves at ports of entry along the southwest border seeking asylum."" Southwest border apprehensions of unaccompanied minors increased 37 percent in October 2016 compared to October 2015. Overall apprehensions increased 41 percent. The main takeaway for our assessment of Rivera’s statement: While overall apprehensions in October 2016 were up from the year before at around 46,000 people, the number of children caught is much smaller. Reasons for Central American children crossing the border So there has been a year-over-year uptick in apprehensions along the southwest border. Why? An August 2016 Congressional Research Service report noted that gang-related violence, poverty and lack of educational and employment opportunities in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras played a key role in children’s decisions to leave their homes on their own and cross illegally into the United States. We could not find strong evidence to back up Rivera’s assertion that the election influenced their decision to come. Media reports published after the election included comments from the mayor of McAllen, Texas, Jim Darling, who said he believed talks about a wall being built along the border motivated immigrants to come sooner rather than later. ""I’m sure that the discussion about a wall and getting tough on immigration was used by people down there to say, ‘Get up here now before it’s too late,’ "" Darling, whose city borders Mexico, told the Washington Post. ""If you talk to them, they all know about President Trump,"" Darling told CNN. ""They all know about a wall. ... The cartels that are encouraging and making money off this travel, they go down and they exploit that."" Darling told CNN he had spoken with recent arrivals. The CNN report, however, also said that Manuel Padilla Jr., chief patrol agent of the Rio Grande Valley Sector, has not noticed an election effect and cited violence and poverty as factors for immigration. Gilman, of the Texas School of Law immigration clinic, also said Central Americans are fleeing extreme violence in their countries. ""I have never yet heard a single child or mother mention the wall as a factor in their decision to migrate or in the timing of their arrival,"" Gilman added. Children and families have not been crossing in great numbers for decades. That has been the case only in recent years, most notably in 2014 and driven by the violence in Central America, Gilman said. Many Central Americans turn themselves to immigration authorities in order to seek asylum protection; to apply, individuals must be physically present in the United States and can do so regardless of how they arrived or of their current immigration status. Immigration officials said that 2014 was the first time Central Americans apprehended on the southern border outnumbered Mexicans. ""The demographics of illegal migration on our southern border has changed significantly over the last 15 years – far fewer Mexicans and single adults are attempting to cross the border without authorization, but more families and unaccompanied children are fleeing poverty and violence in Central America,"" Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security, said in an October statement. Back to Rivera’s comment, a month’s worth of data is also not sufficient to infer increases stem from fears about Trump’s administration policies, said Peter Margulies, who teaches immigration law and national security law at Roger Williams University School of Law. Immigration flows are influenced by many reasons, including conditions in immigrants’ native countries, Margulies said. Still, prospective immigrants care about how politics affects U.S. immigration policy, and smugglers ""will try to exploit fear of President-elect Trump's immigration plans to encourage people to try to enter the U.S. sooner rather than later,"" Margulies said. Our ruling Speaking about children crossing the southwest border, Rivera said tens of thousands are coming now ""because they fear the wall."" About 46,000 people were apprehended at the southwest border in October 2016, the latest data available. But speaking specifically about all unaccompanied children crossing the border, the number is much lower, 6,754. It’s not likely, given the ongoing high levels of violence and poverty in Central American countries, that fears of the election were the primary motivation behind these crossings. The number of Central American unaccompanied children crossing the border increased before the election, peaking in 2014. One month’s worth of data and anecdotal evidence is insufficient to explain that increases stem from fears of a wall, though smugglers might try to exploit that fear to push people toward the United States. Rivera’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Websites offer false headlines about treason 'charges' for Trump, Comey, others
","Social media platforms have lit up recently with various combinations of the words ""treason"" and ""Trump."" But there’s less to the rhetoric than meets the eye. One prominent example making the rounds comes from the aggregation site Realtime Politics. A recent post was headlined, ""BREAKING: Democrats Filing TREASON Charges Against Trump, McConnell, Giuliani, & Comey MONDAY MORNING"" (That would be President-elect Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, former New York City mayor and Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani, and FBI Director James Comey.) The article begins, ""Following the news that the CIA has determined Russia was involved in swaying the election for Donald Trump, both Democratic and REPUBLICAN senators are calling for an investigation into the Russian cyber-attacks that interfered with the presidential election. Four senators issued a statement, Chuck Schumer (D-New York), Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island), John McCain (R-Arizona), and Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina). ... ""Now a group of Democrats plans to file treason charges against Trump, and others that knew about Russia's interference in the election. The group, democraticcoalition.org, announced their plan on Twitter."" So what’s happening here? As we were preparing our fact check, the page in question appears to have been taken down, replaced by a ""404 error"" message. But similar headlines have also surfaced on such sites as Bipartisan Report and New Century Times. We should start by noting that that none of the senators cited in the Realtime Politics article, despite their criticism, have filed any treason ""charges"" (and it’s not clear that they could in any case). Rather, the story is based on a Dec. 11 tweet by a Democratic strategist and fundraiser, Scott Dworkin, who is advising the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, an advocacy group founded earlier this year. In the tweet, Dworkin wrote, ""Breaking: We are filing complaints for treason tmrw on Trump, McConnell, Giuliani & James Comey. #DworkinReport #TrumpLeaks Russians #AMJoy Dworkin did not reply to a call from PolitiFact or an email sent to the firm he founded, Bulldog Finance Group, so we don’t know whether he actually filed a complaint on Dec. 12 -- or, perhaps more important, what kind of complaint it was. But if Dworkin did file a complaint, it wouldn’t have carried much legal weight. Treason is a serious crime that is cited by name in the Constitution, so an ordinary member of the public can’t file ""charges"" over treason on their own. ""Private citizens can’t initiate prosecution,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania constitutional scholar. All they could do is ""tell some federal prosecutor that they think a crime has been committed,"" Roosevelt said. It would then be up to the prosecutor and their superiors to determine whether to proceed -- a move that would not be taken lightly. A previous complaint filed by Dworkin was somewhat more logical. As our friends at Snopes.com have outlined, Dworkin on Oct. 28, 2016, wrote a letter to the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility, requesting that the office open an investigation into possible violations of the Hatch Act by Comey, who many Democrats blamed for airing allegations about Hillary Clinton’s emails late in the presidential campaign. The Office of Professional Responsibility is a Justice Department unit ""responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct"" involving Department attorneys and law-enforcement personnel that ""relate to the exercise of their authority to investigate, litigate or provide legal advice, as well as allegations of misconduct by law enforcement personnel when related to allegations of attorney misconduct,"" according to the office’s web page. So the complaint to the Office of Professional Responsibility about Comey at least made some sense, even though experts have previously told PolitiFact that Comey’s potential to be prosecuted under the Hatch Act is uncertain at best. But accusing anyone -- much less the president-elect and other high officials -- of treason represents a whole other level, experts said. For treason, there is ""a high bar for prosecution, because such prosecutions were common under the King of England, and the founders wanted to protect against frivolous allegations,"" said Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in government ethics at the law firm Akerman. Not surprisingly, Kappel said, the resulting statute on treason ""has been narrowly construed in keeping with the founders’ concerns.""   Experts agreed that since the treason statute refers to ""giving aid and comfort"" to ""enemies"" of the United States, initiating a prosecution -- to say nothing of winning a conviction -- is a steep climb. The statute, Kappel said, has long been interpreted to refer to ""states with which the Unites States was then at war – not merely states that are in some way hostile to the United States. … Since we are not currently at war with Russia, there is no legal basis for a treason complaint.  For that reason, the Justice Department is unlikely to act on any such complaint."" Roosevelt agreed. ""Russia doesn’t meet that criterion,"" he said. The complaint ""sounds empty to me,"" he added. Our ruling Realtime Politics, echoing posts elsewhere, headlined an article, ""Democrats Filing TREASON Charges Against Trump, McConnell, Giuliani, & Comey."" It’s unclear whether such a request has been made, but calling the complaints ""charges"" is wrong. Only prosecutors, not ordinary Americans, can file ""charges."" Moreover, experts told us that the likelihood of actual criminal charges for treason being filed are small, at least given what’s known about the evidence so far. Among other things, treason has historically been judged to require a state of war, something that does not currently exist between the United States and Russia.

Pledging cuts, Donald Trump says at Wisconsin rally that U.S. has highest corporate tax rate
","During a speech in which he warmed up to U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, gave a shout-out to Vince Lombardi and even name-dropped Kanye West, president-elect Donald Trump also reaffirmed his promise to cut taxes. Trump appeared Dec. 13, 2016 with vice president-elect Mike Pence and a host of Badger State Republicans, including Ryan, at the Wisconsin State Fair Park Exposition Center. This stop on his multi-state ""thank-you tour"" was mostly a campaign-style rally, but there was some policy, too.   Midway into his remarks, Trump said: ""We’re going to undertake one of the great tax reforms and simplifications in American history. This includes a massive tax cut for the middle-class and middle-class families from Wisconsin, too. ""We’re also going to lower our business tax rate so that new companies will come to our shores and hire workers in cities like right here. Is that OK? That’s what we want. We’re going to bring our rates down from 35 percent, we’re going to try to get it down to 15 percent. So, right now -- and by the way the jobs will pour in -- so, right now, we’re the highest-taxed nation in the world. And when we finish, we’ll be one of the lower taxed, one of the lower."" Whether the president-elect keeps his promises on taxes will be something to be determined by PolitiFact National’s Trump-O-Meter, which will be launched in 2017. But we can answer now whether America’s business tax rate is the highest in the world. Top U.S. rate: 35% The corporate income tax rates in the United States range from 15 to 35 percent. And that 35 percent top rate -- at least as a ""statutory"" rate (more on that below) -- is relatively high. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development publishes the top corporate tax rates for the 35 countries that belong to its organization, which includes most advanced, industrialized nations. The U.S’ top rate of 35 percent ranks first, just ahead of France, 34.4 percent; Belgium, 33 percent; and Australia and Mexico, 30 percent. On the low end: Switzerland, 8.5 percent; Ireland, 12.5 percent; Latvia and Canada, 15 percent; and Germany, 15.8 percent. Sometimes references are made to a combined corporate tax rate, which includes federal and state corporate taxes; the U.S.’ combined rate is 38.9 percent. But Trump was referring to the 35 percent federal rate, the one he vows to reduce. There are, however, two clarifying points to make. Other nations, and what is paid To back Trump’s statement, his campaign cited a Forbes article that noted the United States has the highest corporate rate among industrialized nations. But Trump didn’t limit his statement to industrialized nations. The accounting firm PwC tracks the top federal corporate tax rates for 155 countries. That list shows five other countries that also have a top rate of 35 percent: Argentina, Chad, Congo, Malta and Zambia. And there are two countries with higher top corporate tax rates: United Arab Emirates, 55 percent; and Puerto Rico, 39 percent. It also needs to be understood that America’s 35 percent top rate is the statutory rate -- before deductions -- but U.S. companies aren’t actually taxed at that rate. Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits. Indeed, a March 2016 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that in each year from 2006 to 2012, at least two-thirds of all active corporations had no federal income tax liability, although larger corporations were more likely to owe tax. And a May 2016 paper by Reed College economics professor Kimberly Clausing found U.S. multinational firms have used tax planning to generate effective tax rates ""that are far lower than the statutory rate, and often in the single digits.""
 Our rating Trump said America’s federal business tax rate is the highest ""in the world."" The top corporate tax in the United States is 35 percent, highest among the world’s industrialized nations. But five smaller nations have the same rate and two smaller ones, United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico, have rates above 35 percent. Also, the 35 percent U.S. rate is only the starting point, given that corporations can use exemptions and deductions to effectively reduce that rate and pay lower taxes.

Fake news: Popular post claims Obama-led U.N. to make U.S. pay African-Americans reparations
","A fake news story circulating online falsely says President Barack Obama has used the United Nations to somehow force the United States to pay African-Americans reparations for slavery. The headline from the website Freedom Daily is wrong in every way and should be disregarded. ""Obama-Led U.N. Has Just Made It Official, U.S. To Immediately Pay Blacks ‘Reparations’,"" it read on Dec. 9, 2016. Freedom Daily, which bills itself as ""a forum for discussing meaningful conservative American and world news,"" quotes a story from a similar website called the Conservative Daily Post. These websites ridicule a report from the United Nations' Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, a Geneva-based panel that had found the United States’ history of slavery had left a lasting impact on American society that justified reparations to African-Americans. They presented their report to the United Nations Human Rights Council in September 2016. The group of global human rights experts concluded from their research that past transgressions had led to current strife in America. ""In particular, the legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remains a serious challenge, as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of African descent,"" the report read. ""Contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching."" The panel said progress had been made in America over the decades, but the nation was facing a ""human rights crisis"" brought on by the lingering racial discord. The ""reparatory justice"" suggested by the panel includes considering benefits similar to those sought by a Caribbean coalition seeking reparations from European countries that colonized them. Those reparations encompass the possibilities of ""a formal apology, health initiatives, educational opportunities, an African knowledge programme, psychological rehabilitation, technology transfer and financial support, and debt cancellation."" Let’s first acknowledge that Obama doesn’t lead the United Nations, though the United States certainly holds sway over U.N. actions. The United States is a charter member of the group, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and a significant financial contributor. But the body is led by South Korean Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who will be succeeded by Portuguese leader Antonio Guterres on Jan. 1, 2017. Furthermore, Obama has publicly said that he does not support the idea of financial reparations for slavery. He has said he’d prefer to focus on expanding access to jobs, health care, education and other programs to address the disadvantages minorities face. Additionally, the panel’s findings are nonbinding. The United Nations isn’t forcing the United States to do anything. The report was an academic exercise to explore the legacy of slavery on modern America. There’s nothing official about the report beyond its U.N.-sanctioned research. There certainly isn’t any plan for the federal government to pay such reparations, immediately or otherwise. Our ruling The website Freedom Daily said in a headline that the ""Obama-Led U.N. has just made it official, U.S. to immediately pay blacks ‘reparations’."" The posts track back to a U.N.-affiliated panel that concluded America’s history of slavery has stacked the deck against modern African-Americans. The group found that reparations to those citizens are justifiable. Every part of the eye-grabbing headline is wrong: Obama doesn’t lead the United Nations, the report is non-binding and has no official impact on the federal government, and there are no plans for the U.S. to immediately pay reparations. About the only thing accurate thing in the posts are that such a study even exists, but it’s presented in such a misleading way that it’s beyond just inaccurate.
