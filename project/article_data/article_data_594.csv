Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett says 53 percent of Detroit’s police force moved out of city after residency rule was lifted
","
Facing an uphill fight to preserve a requirement that police officers live in the city, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is invoking Detroit -- perhaps America’s No. 1 symbol of urban decay.

Milwaukee is one of the nation’s last big cities with a residency rule, but Republicans in control of state government appear poised to change that. Gov. Scott Walker’s budget would free Milwaukee teachers of residency, and a GOP-backed bill would let Milwaukee police and firefighters live anywhere in the five-county area.

Barrett opposes both moves, arguing that city property values will decline because large numbers of middle-class employees will move to the suburbs. Proponents -- typically employee unions -- say workers should be able to live where they want to live.

The mayor quantified his concern in a Business Journal story in which he explicitly predicted Milwaukee could see a Detroit-style devastation of its tax base if residency rules are ended.

""Eleven years ago, the city of Detroit lifted the residency requirement for police officers and today, 53 percent of officers live outside of the city,"" said Barrett. ""If we want the tax base of Milwaukee to resemble the tax base of Detroit, this is the way to go.""

He added: ""I don’t want the tax base of Milwaukee to be as decimated as the tax base in Detroit.""

Did Detroit’s police force undergo such a radical geographical change? And how much of the blame for tax-base losses is traceable to dumping residency?

A bit of background first.

All Milwaukee city employees are currently required to live within the city limits, a rule that has been in place since 1930, according to the mayor's office. Chicago, another holdout for residency, apparently will stick with it based on comments by incoming Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

What about Detroit?

Mayor Dave Bing recently unveiled a program to help cops buy homes in the city -- an effort to reverse the migration that Bing says followed the 1999 scrapping of Detroit’s residency law by Michigan state lawmakers.

In his 2011 state of the city speech in February, Bing said approximately half of the Detroit force now lives outside the city’s confines.

We asked Bing’s office for backup, and spokesman Dan Lijana said the precise figure is 53 percent, and we confirmed that with the Detroit Police Department.

So on the numbers Barrett is right. And Detroit is not alone in seeing big numbers of employees leave.

St. Louis dropped its requirement in 2005 and 36 percent of those eligible to live elsewhere have so far chosen that route.

Barrett points to a 1994 city-commissioned study on teachers that predicted 60 percent would live outside the city without a residency requirement. The conclusion was based partly on other cities’ experiences. Marc Levine, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professor who has studied urban out-migration, said he estimated 50 percent to 65 percent would leave over time.

Unions who back lifting the rules predict far less impact than city officials.

""I don’t think it will cause a mass exodus or the doom and gloom the mayor portrays,"" said Milwaukee Police Association President Michael Crivello.

But what about the assertion, implicit in Barrett’s remarks, that the loss of residency requirements leads to tax base losses? That’s part of the claim, too.

Academics, real estate officials and City Hall agree that sale prices could get pushed down, especially in pockets near the city’s edges where many city employees and teachers tend to live. They disagree on the extent of the reduction in values, and how widespread it would be.

Nailing down the extent of the cause and effect in other cities is difficult if not impossible. There is a dearth of useful research trying to parse out exactly how much impact residency has on a city’s tax base.

But there is strong anecdotal evidence that Detroit’s decades-long population and tax base decline was accelerated after the state dropped residency for city workers, said Patrick Anderson, a former Michigan budget official and expert on the economics of Michigan cities.

Anderson is CEO of Anderson Economic Group, which predicted negative effects from dropping residency, in  a study commissioned by Detroit officials in 1999.

At the same time, Anderson said, you can’t blame most of Detroit’s woes on the residency change. And Milwaukee, he said, has avoided some of the disastrous political squabbling and decision-making that hurt Detroit.

Anderson notes Milwaukee has not taken the hits Detroit has -- and in fact its population has stabilized. That’s a point Barrett agrees with. The mayor  attributes some of that to the residency rule, and says he wants to avoid action that tips the trend in the wrong direction.

Said Anderson: ""Once a city starts to deteriorate in safety, public services, tax base and cost, no ordinance will keep people inside its fence.""

It’s also worth noting that those cities that have dropped residency rules have taken different approaches.

Some have tried to limit a fast exodus -- and the potential hit on their tax base.

Philadelphia, for example, requires five years on the force before officers can live outside the city; St. Louis makes it seven.

The Milwaukee police bill does not put on any such restrictions.

Some observers, though, see an overreach in Barrett’s allusion to Detroit.

""That’s a worst-case scenario,"" said Marquette University economics professor David Clark. ""When you look at Detroit, they have faced significant challenges that we have not faced. They were tied to one industry. We have a more diverse employment base. We don’t have the crime they have and haven’t seen entire neighborhoods empty out like they have.""

So, the real estate market, the economy, crime and other quality of life factors can play into moving decisions -- and the impact on home values.

Let’s return home and to the question at hand.

Barrett notes that less than a decade after Detroit dropped residency, less than half its police force still lives in the city -- and in the same breath ties the change to the ""decimated"" state of Detroit’s tax base.

The statistic Barrett cited was confirmed by Detroit officials and has gone unchallenged.

Evaluating the implicit claim that ties the residency issue to tax base loss is more difficult. Experts agree there is at least some negative impact, but note there are many other factors at work.

"['Abortion', 'Georgia', 'Hank Johnson']","
Congressman says federal funding cuts could increase abortions 44 percent
","
Federal budget wars have morphed into culture wars, and fiscal and social conservatives have set their sights on cutting family planning funds.

The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives voted last month to take away $317 million in funds for the Title X program, which provides reproductive health services such as contraception and HIV testing for people who cannot afford it.

Now the program’s fate lies with the Democratic-controlled Senate, and Title X defenders are launching a counterattack. In an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, a Lithonia Democrat, unleashed a statistic that could give even a staunch Title X critic pause.  

""Studies have shown that in the absence of Title X, we are going to see the level of abortion in Georgia increase by about 44 percent,"" Johnson said.

Really?

Title X serves at least 144,000 Georgians, of whom 139,000 are women. Federal rules bar those funds from being used for abortion. But anti-abortion advocates believe that revoking them would hurt groups such as Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions at some of its clinics.

The House also voted to bar all federal funding for Planned Parenthood.

Johnson spokesman Andy Phelan sent us statistics from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy group, to back up the congressman’s claim.  

Guttmacher’s roots lie in the movement to support abortion rights, but advocates on both sides of the abortion debate use its research to back their positions.

Johnson’s paraphrase of Guttmacher’s research was right on. The institute’s Title X fact sheet for Georgia says, ""In the absence of these services, the level of abortion in Georgia would be 44 percent higher.""  

Methods to determine whether publicly funded family planning services reduce the number of unintended pregnancies have existed for ""decades,"" said Guttmacher’s Jennifer Frost, a senior researcher and lead author of a 2008 paper about the group’s predictions.

In the absence of affordable care, women tend to choose birth control methods that are less effective, Frost said.

Since researchers cannot conduct actual experiments on what would happen if these services ended, Frost and her colleagues considered five types of behaviors -- ranging from switching contraceptive methods to dropping contraception all together -- that women might choose if funding disappeared.

The research team knew from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey data how often women who adopt these behaviors had unplanned pregnancies and abortions. It used this information for its projections.

Nationally, abortions would rise by about one-third, the team predicted. Because Georgia women use Title X services at greater than the national rate, Guttmacher predicted a 44 percent increase here.

In 2008, 39,820 women obtained abortions in Georgia, according to Guttmacher.

We were unable to find another study on Georgia similar to Guttmacher’s, but its research does align with studies on the broader topic of how contraceptive use affects abortion rates. When contraception increases, the abortion rate generally declines, said Charles Westoff, a Princeton University professor who has compared data for dozens of countries.  

""It is obvious to most people that if the prevalence or availability of modern contraceptives is reduced, the unintentional pregnancy rate will rise and thus the abortion rate,"" Westoff said.

Guttmacher may have underestimated the unintended pregnancies Title X averts, said Diana Greene Foster, a reproductive health expert at the University of California, San Francisco. She studied the group’s California numbers and thinks they are 20 percent too low.

""I can’t say that their estimate of pregnancies averted for Georgia is too low by 20 percent. But I believe that in general, their methodology produces conservative estimates,"" Foster told PoltiFact Georgia in an e-mail.

University of Alabama professor Michael New, whose research is widely used to support anti-abortion positions, says Guttmacher’s figures are unpersuasive.

New cited a 2002 Guttmacher study on women who had abortions. Of those who did not use contraceptives, 12 percent said they could not afford or gain access to them. This low percentage suggests Title X has little effect on abortions, New said.  

That same study, however, also found that women with lower income and education levels are less likely to use contraception, and those who use no contraception are more likely to have abortions.

New also cited a Guttmacher analysis of abortion statistics in 13 countries. Abortions declined in seven of those countries after modern contraception became popular, but they initially rose in the U.S. and five other countries. Still, in the U.S. and at least three other countries where abortions increased, abortion rates eventually declined.

Did Johnson get his facts right?

Johnson said ""studies"" show Georgia’s abortion level would increase by 44 percent. In fact, he cited a single study from a widely respected group. While scholars have found that in general, increases in the use of contraceptives lead to decreases in abortion, and one expert said Guttmacher may have underestimated its Georgia figures, we found no other study that confirms or refutes its conclusions about this state.

Johnson would have been right if he said that studies show contraception decreases abortion, and that without Title X funds, abortions could rise.  

But he didn’t. We therefore rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/22/hank-johnson/congressman-says-funding-decision-could-increase-a/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan says CBO model of economy self-destructs due to rising deficits in 2037
","
Recently, House Budget chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., allowed journalists from CNN to attend a closed-door briefing that he held for fellow Republican lawmakers. One comment Ryan made during his presentation caught our eye.

""The Congressional Budget Office has this economic model where they measure the economy going forward, and they are now telling us that the entire economy crashes in the year 2037 because their computer simulation can't conceive of any way in which the U.S. economy can continue,"" Ryan said, according to the CNN report, which also included a video clip of the comment.

We wondered whether Ryan was accurately describing what the CBO -- Congress’ non-partisan fiscal-analysis office -- was saying. We found that Ryan has a point about the peril facing the economy from the nation’s rapidly growing debt, but we also found that his comment was somewhat exaggerated.

We turned to several economists, including liberals and conservatives, to see whether they knew of evidence that might support Ryan’s statement.

They pointed to several documents that shed light on the claim. One was the CBO’s analysis of Ryan’s own budget ""roadmap,"" published in early 2010.

The report compared Ryan’s proposal to a CBO model that takes the current baseline budget numbers and adjusts them to account for a number of policy changes, most of which are expected to be enacted. This can be considered an approximation of the status-quo.

Analyzing this status-quo model, the CBO wrote that  ""it is not possible to simulate the effects … after 2058 because deficits become so large and unsustainable that the model cannot calculate their effects."" (The CBO went on to write that, compared to the status-quo option, Ryan’s plan did a better job of bringing down the debt and promoting economic output.)

Still, the year this economic model essentially blows up, according to CBO, is 2058 -- 21 years later than what Ryan said in the CNN clip.

Subsequent estimates, with new data and revised methodologies, produced different -- and more dire -- conclusions.

The CBO published a document called the Long-Term Budget Outlook in June 2010 and then revised it in August 2010. Like the analysis of Ryan’s plan, this study also used multiple models to analyze the future fiscal and economic picture.

The CBO cautioned that one of these economic models breaks down if debt were continue to accrue indefinitely. ""The economic model used for this comparison is capable of estimating outcomes only under sustainable government policies,"" the CBO wrote, referring to policies that rein in the debt rather than letting it spiral out of control.

Under the August revision, the CBO says this model functions through at least 2035.

Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said it’s plausible that the model could implode as early as the 2030s, though he added that other models analyzed by the CBO do not predict an implosion that soon.

So the CBO has used a variety of models to analyze the future state of the economy, and some of them suggest serious problems for the economy within the next few decades. But there’s uncertainty about whether any of the CBO models specifically fail by 2037, as Ryan says, and his language -- that the ""entire economy crashes"" -- is probably a bit too apocalyptic given the uncertainties of the modeling.

Our experts added a few other caveats.

The model Ryan is referring to is based on the assumption that no policy changes are made to reduce the debt.

Even though lawmakers have typically been loath to touch the main drivers of the nation’s debt burden -- entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare -- some economists said that it was unrealistic that politicians would simply let the economy implode rather than making changes to stave off that fate.

""This one is same category as shouting, ‘If you keep going like this, you're going to end up the Pacific Ocean’ to someone headed west from New Jersey,"" said Dean Baker, a liberal economist. ""It is absolutely true, but in an absurd way.""

Baker said that the CBO does long-term budget projections that assume that ""Congress never does anything even as the debt increases, pushing up interest payments, leading to ever-larger deficits. … I'm not sure what Ryan thinks that he is showing by this. It is almost inconceivable that we would ever see anything like this.""

The models the CBO uses are just that -- models.

Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that he agrees that the economy is in danger, but not necessarily for the reasons laid out in the model. He thinks the general burden of government will be more of a defining factor than deficits or debt per se.

""The real issue is whether the CBO model makes sense,"" Mitchell said. ""I don't think it does because it is based largely on deficits and debt being the key determinants of economic performance. That's not true, though in extreme cases those factors can be very important. People are right to worry about the long run, even if CBO's methodology is a bit dodgy.""

So where does this leave us? We’ll start by listing the exaggerations in Ryan’s statement.

First, he implies that there’s only one CBO model, glossing over the fact that the agency uses multiple models that have produced varying results. Second, Ryan predicts a collapse in 2037, but there’s considerable variation in the doomsday year depending on the model the CBO uses and the data it plugs into its calculations.

Third, Ryan’s statement assumes that no change will be made from current policies before a collapse -- an assumption that’s unlikely. And fourth, his claim that the CBO’s ""computer simulation can't conceive of any way in which the U.S. economy can continue"" strikes us as an overstatement. In fact, the CBO finds lots of unpalatable scenarios if things get bad enough, but the agency doesn’t go so far as to suggest that the economy will simply cease functioning. Economies are far more complex than any single model, so just because a model stops working, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the economy will bring us back to hunter-gatherer days when the model stops working.

What saves Ryan’s comment is that, despite his exaggerations, his general point is valid. The economists we spoke to agreed that that the nation’s current path of deficits and debt, if not altered, will become unsustainable.

""The issue is simply that under current law, the debt-to-GDP ratio soars so high that economic models break down,"" said J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""The truth is that nobody really knows what would happen as the debt-to-GDP ratio pushes through 100 percent on the way to 200 or 300 percent. The models certainly are not capable of anticipating the effects.  But you don't have to have an economic model to appreciate the clear picture of fiscal Armageddon.""

Generally, then, Ryan’s oversimplifications and exaggerations lead us to downgrade our rating, but his broader point about the perils of the debt for the nation’s economy remains accurate. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/21/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-cbo-model-self-destructs-due-rising/

Rick Scott presses for Panama trade agreement after international trip
","
Florida Gov. Rick Scott led a delegation of state business leaders to Panama March 17-18, 2011, where Scott met with government leaders, surveyed the expansion of the Panama Canal, and urged President Barack Obama to send a free trade agreement between Panama and the United States to Congress for ratification.

Scott said the free trade agreement, which has been languishing since 2007, could mean jobs for Florida's less than bustling economy.

""In Panama, I saw firsthand the construction being done to expand the Panama Canal,"" Scott said on March 18 during his weekly radio address. ""Florida must be ready for the massive Post-Panamax ships from Asia, Europe and Central and South America that will come and go through the canal.

""After meeting with Panamanian trade leaders, I am convinced more than ever that free trade agreements with Panama and other Latin American countries are essential to Florida's future. Florida has an important stake in ratification of trade agreements with both Panama and Colombia – agreements that have been waiting for congressional ratification since 2007.

""According to 2009 estimates, an agreement with Panama could result in almost 1,900 Florida jobs in the first year -– and about 15,000 jobs after five years,"" he said. ""Florida exporters will lose market share if these agreements are not in place.""

At a time when the state's unemployment rate sits at 11.9 percent, we thought it appropriate to check Scott's job-creation figures.

Republicans have been pressuring Obama to submit the Panama trade agreement and another agreement with Colombia to Congress for ratification. White House officials have said the president plans to pursue both trade deals -- which have been languishing since 2007 -- though each has problems that need to be addressed. In Colombia, it's concerns over labor rights. In Panama, it's the country's history of being a tax haven as well as a requirement that at least 40 workers must agree to start a union.

The agreement with Panama would make 88 percent of U.S. commercial and industrial exports duty-free immediately, with remaining tariffs being phased out over a 10-year period, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. More than 60 percent of farm exports to Panama would also be immediately duty-free upon the agreement's ratification.

Scott's job-creation estimates come from an analysis produced by Enterprise Florida, an economic development public-private partnership chaired by the governor.

The group produced a six-page report in May 2009 discussing the implications of the Panama-U.S. trade agreement in Florida. Much of that analysis, the report says, is developed using estimates and trade scenarios developed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The U.S. Chamber predicted that U.S. exports would grow at an annual rate of 25 percent if the trade agreement is approved, compared to 16.5 percent if a trade agreement is not reached. That would translate to an additional $263 million in exports in the first year of the agreement, Enterprise Florida said. By the fifth year, exports would be $2.8 billion higher annually. U.S. imports from Panama would not increase substantially, the analysis concluded.

What would that mean for Florida?

Enterprise Florida concluded that by using the chamber's growth assumptions -- and the U.S. Department of Commerce's ""rule of thumb"" that each additional $1 billion in exports creates 11,000 jobs -- Florida would see an additional 995 jobs in the first year of the agreement and 10,600 additional jobs after five years. On top of that, Enterprise Florida said, the state would see an increase in services exports -- tourism, education and training, banking -- that would create 900 jobs in the first year and 4,500 by the fifth year.

Added together, that's a total of 1,895 jobs in the first year and 15,100 by the fifth year, according to Enterprise Florida.

Scott properly cites the totals in his figures, but he doesn't explain just how speculative they are.

To create job estimates, Enterprise Florida first had to estimate the increase in export traffic produced by the agreement, then estimate the dollar figures associated with that increase. The group then had to estimate how much of that increase would be confined to Florida. And then they had to produce job estimates using another estimate that $1 billion in additional exports create 11,000 jobs (we found other estimates that say $1 billion creates 6,000, 9,000 or even 25,000 jobs).

What's more telling is that the United States International Trade Commission attempted to determine the economic impact of the Panama treaty -- just like Enterprise Florida -- and said it couldn't.

In a 175-page study that relied on 2006 data, the trade commission said that Panama ranks as the 45th-largest market for U.S. exports ($2.5 billion), and accounted for less than 0.5 percent of total U.S. exports ($929.5 billion). The chief export to Panama is petroleum products. U.S. merchandise imports from Panama, meanwhile, were valued at $337.6 million, making Panama the United States' 102nd-largest import supplier. Panama's biggest export is fish.

""It was not possible to quantify the impact of the (trade agreement) on U.S. gross domestic product, overall trade, aggregate employment and overall consumer welfare,"" the commission wrote. Later, the commission said that any impact on the U.S. economy would be small.

The trade commission predicted that, as a result of the trade agreement, the largest growth will accrue in the U.S. exports of rice (145 percent), pork (96 percent), beef (94 percent) and passenger vehicles (43 percent). ""Again, these would amount to a very small dollar-value increase given that, with the exception of rice, the U.S. exports of these goods to Panama represent less than two-tenths of one percent (0.2 percent) of U.S. exports to the world and even a smaller portion of U.S. production,"" the commission wrote.

Imports would not grow significantly because most Panamanian products already enter the United States duty-free, the commission said.

In trumpeting a possible trade agreement with Panama, Scott tried to highlight the benefits to Florida by saying the agreement ""could result in almost 1,900 Florida jobs in the first year – and about 15,000 jobs after five years.""

Scott rightly couches his job claim by noting that it's an estimate and offering the qualifier ""could,"" so we can't fault him too much. But the fact is the analysis Scott relied on to make his claim is based on a series of significant assumptions or estimates, and a much more thorough analysis concluded that determining the impact on jobs created by the trade agreement with Panama was not possible. The lesson here is to be wary of any job estimate figure. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-presses-panama-trade-agreement-after-in/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says a ""rather extraordinary amount of non-classroom employees"" were added by Texas school districts over the last decade
","
Hinting that Texas school districts should adjust budgets without laying off loads of teachers, Gov. RIck Perry told Capitol reporters March 9 that non-classroom school employees are burgeoning.

""Over the course of the last decade, we have seen a rather extraordinary amount of non-classroom employees added to (Texas public) school rolls,"" Perry said. ""So are the administrators and the school boards going to make a decision to reduce those, or are they going to make a decision to reduce the number of teachers in the classroom? I certainly know where I would point.""

Responding to a request for more information that day, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said in an e-mail that from 1998-99 to 2008-09, the number of Texas public school teachers rose 27.1 percent from 256,276 to 325,809 while the number of administrators increased 35.6 percent from 18,531 to 25,130.

Diving in, we broadened the back-up comparison bandied by Perry's office to encompass a full decade. In 1998-99, according to TEA, teachers comprised 51 percent of the state’s 506,604 full-time employees and administrative staff made up 3.4 percent. Other non-classroom workers, including support and  auxiliary staff, accounted for the rest. 
In 2009-10, teachers amounted to 50 percent and administrative staff accounted for nearly 4 percent of the state’s 661,286 full-tiime school district posts.

So, teachers were slightly down as a share of school district workforces and administrators were up. But how ""extraordinary"" (in Perry’s words) was that increase?

Frazier said the figures fueling Perry’s statement trace to a December recommendation by State Comptroller Susan Combs that the state ""study patterns in school district administrative staffing."" From 1998-99 to 2008-09, Combs says, the ratio of Texas school teachers to administrators declined from nearly 14-to-1 to 13-to-1--meaning 1,571 administrative positions would have to be cut to achieve the previous ratio.

Administrators are defined in the recommendation as superintendents at all levels (assistant, associate and deputy), chief administrative officers, chief executive officers and/or presidents, tax assessors and/or collectors, athletic directors, business managers, directors of personnel and/or human resources, instructional officers, principals, assistant principals, registrars and teacher supervisers.

Tom Currah, an assistant director at the comptroller’s office, told us in an interview that Combs focused on positions the education agency defines as administrative--not counting, for instance, counselors, librarians, janitors and similar support and auxiliary staff. ""We were looking at management types,"" Currah said.

Next, we used the TEA’s counts to take a crack at school districts’ staff changes over the decade.

Some perspective: Student enrollment increased from more than 3.9 milllion in 1998-99 to more than 4.8 million in 2009-10, up 22 percent.

For 2009-10, the state counted 333,090 teachers, up 28 percent from 1998-99, and 25,525 administrative posts, up 48 percent. Districts’ employees over all totaled 661,286, an increase of 31 percent.

Staffing was down from 1998-99 in only one of nine administrative categories, tax assessor-collectors. Among other categories, the biggest percentage increases resided in district instructional program directors or executive directors (up 55 percent); assistant principals (up 53 percent); and directors of personnel/human resources (up 51 percent). The biggest increase in raw numbers, from 3,167 to 9,129, was for assistant principals.

We noticed that another school employee category, support staff, increased by a larger margin than administrative staff--by 60 percent to 59,571 positions as of 2009-10. Two other categories, paraprofessionals and auxiliary staff, increased less than 30 percent each.

Among support staff positions, ""other campus professional personnel"" increased nearly 300 percent, totaling 5,635 in 2009-10, and other non-instructional district personnel nearly doubled to 13,568. TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told us examples of other campus professionals, who serve on one or more campuses, include community liaisons, informational technology staff and instructional officers. Examples of non-instructional personnel include administrative department heads, associates or assistants and professional-level staff in areas including food service, research/evaluation, transportation, purchasing and security.

Next, we looked at the overall change in all non-classroom employees, who increased 33 percent to 328,194 from 1998-99 to 2009-10. One way of summing this up is to say the districts’ overall hiring rate of non-classroom workers ran 18 percent ahead of the hiring rate for teachers.

How come?

Lynn Moak, a former TEA administrator and Austin lobbyist whose clients include an alliance of large school districts, suggested in an interview that some of the faster-paced increase in support staff traces to positions funded by federal, not state, aid. Broadly, he said, the increase reflects districts hiring people to guide teachers and students toward fulfilling toughened accountability standards.

""You didn’t do that by adding more teachers"" necessarily, Moak said. ""You did that by making the teachers we had better.""

A March 4 online post by his firm, Moak, Casey & Associates, says that most of these non-teaching, non-administrative staffers ""are providing services to students"" and ""are not easily expendable, particularly if current service levels are to be maintained and compliance with federal and state requirements is to be met.""

""If you’re trying to maintain student performance while you’re trying to go through these financially tight times, you’re going to see a lot of different patterns depending on how the district is organized and how the district is doing,"" Moak said. ""If the district is needing a lot of help from these other (non-classroom) staff, the district may choose to keep these other staff rather than keep teachers.""

Upshot: Over the decade, the increase in non-classroom employees -- especially in support and administrative staff -- outpaced growth in student enrollment and teachers. But whether this addition of non-classroom staff qualifies as ""extraordinary"" is open to debate. We rate Perry’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/21/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-there-was-extraordinary-growth-non/
"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Chris Larson']","
Wisconsin state Senator Chris Larson says Democrats who left the state to delay a vote were exercising a “Wisconsin filibuster” provided by the state’s constitution
","
In the fall of 2010, Chris Larson was serving in relative obscurity as a member of the Milwaukee County Board.

By March 2011, he was a political celebrity, lauded by some -- and vilified by others -- as one of 14 Democratic state senators who fled to Illinois for more than three weeks to thwart a quick vote on Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to curtail collective bargaining rights for public employees.

""Today’s Heroes: the Wisconsin 14"" trumpeted the national AFL-CIO website.

""When are they going to come back? Are they coming back from somewhere downstate? This seems ludicrous,"" MSNBC host and political commentator Chris Matthews said on his March 9 show, 21 days after the Democrats left. ""This is something that happens in a banana republic. When are we going to have a Legislature meeting in Wisconsin and decide this?""
 
As senators on both sides face possible recall elections, Larson is now defending leaving the state not only as the right thing to do -- but as a matter of the lawmakers exercising their state constitutional rights.

The Democrats returned March 12 after Republicans removed fiscal items from the bill, allowing them to vote without needing 20 members present -- the 3/5ths quorum requirement that allowed for the departure. There are 19 Republicans in the Senate.

Interviewed March 11 at an Illinois rest stop on his way home, Larson told a WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) television reporter he would do it all again to stall moves by the GOP majority in Madison.

""That’s a tool that our constitution gives us,"" Larson said. ""It’s a little bit different than the U.S. filibuster, but it’s the Wisconsin filibuster and that’s how it works.""

The reporter followed up: ""Leaving the state is the new Wisconsin filibuster?""

Larson, cracking a brief smile, responded: ""It is.""

Most people are familiar with the filibuster, a legislative tactic common to the U.S. Senate and some state legislatures that allows a minority-party’s objection to stall or kill final action unless a super-majority wants to proceed. In the U.S. Senate, it used to involve round-the-clock speeches but now is a simple procedural maneuver.

During the heated and massive Madison protests, we heard some casual references to the boycott as a ""filibuster with feet.""

But did Larson mean to assert that Wisconsin’s Constitution, adopted in 1848, provides for a filibuster?

He did, according to his chief of staff, Justin Sargent:

""This is in Article 8, Section 8 of the State Constitution. This constitutional filibuster essentially stops passage on a bill that is fiscal, if the body is lacking a 3/5ths quorum.  In special session, this is the only defense the minority has to stop or even temporarily delay a bill.""

Larson himself was less emphatic when we asked him about the filibuster comparison. He said he meant only to draw an analogy between the boycott and a filibuster.

We decided to test his claim given the historic nature of the boycott and the prospect it could happen again.

Let’s start with what both sides -- and experts -- agree on: Wisconsin by legislative rule does limit debate. But it does not provide for a filibuster by statute, rule or any constitutional provision.

Cutting off debate is rare, but it happens.

The constitutional section Larson cites requires a 3/5th’s quorum to vote on certain tax and fiscal items -- not to pass the measure, but to act on the measure. It was that provision Democrats took advantage of in staying away.

Beyond that, the debate turns to warring legal interpretations.

But we can learn from those as well.

Lawyers and officials on the Republican side say not only is there no constitutional filibuster, but the Democratic boycott violated the constitutional oath of office and a Senate rule that bars absenteeism without leave.

""It’s a grossly frivolous and very dangerous misstatement that they could absent themselves purposely from the body to avoid a quorum,"" said Jim Troupis, a lawyer who advised Senate Republicans. ""If there was no duty to attend, there would be no duty to have a Legislature.""

This would lead to an executive branch dictatorship, he contended.

During the legislative battle, an Oconto County Circuit Court judge ruled that State Sen. Jim Holperin (D-Conover) appeared to be violating a rule that requires senators to attend sessions. But he wrote that it is the Senate -- not the courts -- that enforce those rules.

A lawyer who has advised the Democrats, Jeremy Levinson, agreed lawmakers have to show, but said the penalties for absenteeism are so weak that ultimately it is up to voters to decide whether lawmakers have shirked their duty.

Levinson argues the constitution, in effect, allows boycotts because it lets legislators make their own rules -- and the rules have not effectively barred such behavior.

University of Wisconsin political scientist Donald Downs, a constitutional scholar affiliated with the law school, agreed, with qualifications.

""It’s a new constitutional argument,"" Downs said. ""I would say the burden of proof is on him to show it’s a right, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court has been open-minded concerning the power of each house to determine it’s own rules.""

Labor lawyer and author Tom Geoghegan, a prominent liberal critic of unlimited filibustering, said the boycott move was permitted by the state constitution.

""It’s a provision that’s an extra check on the majority just slamming something through,"" he said.

But Andrew Welhouse, spokesman for Republican Sen. Scott Fitzgerald, the majority leader, said the quorum requirement was turned on its head by Democrats.

""It was originally intended as a way to protect the minority from the majority by making sure that a proper number of officials were there to do business, not enable the minority to stand in the way of the majority,"" he said.

Looking back into history, what was the original stated purpose of the provision requiring 20 senators in attendance?

The constitutional provision dates to Wisconsin’s statehood in 1848 and was modeled after a New York state provision. In a later discussion at the New York constitutional convention of 1915, it was said that a 3/5th’s quorum approach ""was designed to prevent hasty and careless legislation and to insure a larger attendance when a bill was to be voted upon,"" according to documents archived by the New York State Library.

Indeed, the Wisconsin boycott that would follow nearly a century later is an echo of sorts to concerns raised at the time.

Opponents of the super quorum ""argued that a small minority merely by refusing to make an appearance could obstruct a vote and defeat legislation."" (italics added)

So those are some of the arguments.

Let’s get to the nub of the matter.

Was the Democrats’ move a ""constitutional filibuster"" that’s only a little bit different than the U.S. Senate filibuster, as Larson said?

The general idea is the same -- a procedural mechanism for stalling a vote.

But it’s not a filibuster, said Geoghegan, as well as Mordecai Lee, a former Democratic state senator from Milwaukee. Closer to a filibuster, Lee said,  was the 61-hour debate that Assembly Democrats forced on Walker’s budget-repair bill.

Lester Pines, an attorney for the Madison teachers union, said the boycott delayed the vote, but he agreed that the Wisconsin Constitution ""wasn’t intended to provide a filibuster."" He called the Democrats’ action ""civil disobedience.""

We asked Larson to explain why, if the action was provided for in the constitution, he and the others had to leave the state to exercise a Wisconsin constitutional right.

He said the Democrats were just being ""extra safe"" because Republicans appeared to have the ability to compel attendance but it was unclear to what lengths they would go and what the legalities were. 
Court rulings are lacking on whether they could have stayed in state and avoided being forced back to the Capitol, he said. 
Of course, by noting they could have been compelled to return, Larson undermines the main argument that they were free to leave.

Where does all this leave us?

Larson attaches a clever label to the three-week Democratic boycott, calling it the ""Wisconsin filibuster"" and saying the state constitution explicitly gives senators that tool.

Like the U.S. filibuster, the Dems’ move was a procedural tactic to delay a vote. But that’s about where the similarities end.

There is no dispute -- even among Democrats -- that Wisconsin lacks a filibuster provision used in other states and in the U.S. Senate. Indeed, Democrats felt shaky enough about their legal ground that they left the state to avoid being compelled to return to Madison.

The quorum provision in the constitution did create an opening for the Democrats to no-show. So, in that sense, Larson is correct that the constitution ""gave"" them a tool to delay the vote. But a critical fact that would give a different impression is left out: Wisconsin has no filibuster provision.

Organizing for America says GOP budget would cut 1 million jobs
","
Organizing for America has hit the web this week to marshal opposition to $61 billion in budget cuts proposed by House Republicans.

OFA is a Democratic organization that arose from President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign operation. Its Virginia arm claimed in Twitter messages and a Facebook posting in mid-March that the GOP budget plan ""would cut nearly a million jobs.""

Since the U.S. has added about 1.3 million total jobs in the past 12 months, any plan that could take away 1 million sounds like serious business. We set out to see if OFA and the Democrats have their facts right.

Democrats have been brandishing two big numbers during the debates. One is a claim that 700,000 jobs would be lost if the GOP budget is enacted. The second, as mentioned above, is that almost one million jobs are at stake.

Alec Gerlach, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, told us these different numbers are based on separate economic estimates. The 700,000 figure comes from a report by Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.

Zandi said the spending cuts would reduce the U.S. Gross Domestic Product and cause a loss of 700,000 existing and anticipated jobs by the end of 2012.  

Zandi’s computations are complicated. They do not mean that 700,000 people would lose jobs. They include a loss of hypothetical jobs Zandi believes would be created if government spending is not cut.

The estimate of ""nearly a million jobs being lost"" first appeared in a Feb. 15 column by Dana Milbank, a left-leaning columnist at The Washington Post. Milbank spoke with Scott Lilly, former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee and now a research fellow at the left-leaning  Center for American Progress.

Lilly estimated the GOP plan would eradicate 650,000 jobs, both at government agencies and at companies working for the government. With those unemployed workers suddenly spending less money, he told us another 325,000 jobs -- or one for every two laid-off workers -- could be lost.

""If you are cutting highway spending or clean water work, the impact can occur over three to four years,"" Lilly told us. ""If you cut federal employees and reduce the number of people at the Social Security Administration this year, you know the exact timing of the impact.""

These estimates, as well as a report by Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips warning that a $60 billion cut could cost the economy 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent of its GDP growth in the middle part of this year, have drawn fire from some economists.

John Taylor, a conservative economist at Stanford University, believes the economy would grow faster if Congress pushes through spending cuts and shows it has a ""credible’ debt reduction plan. He said the cuts would make businesses less worried about future tax increases, meaning they would be more likely to start hiring additional employees. His reasoning has been embraced by many Republicans, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, R-7th.

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told a Senate committee March 1 that while GOP spending cuts would ""have a negative impact"" on the economy, he said the job losses ""would be certainly much less than 700,000."" The Fed chairman also disputed the idea that the cuts could lower GDP growth by 2 percent.

Federal spending cuts are a rarity in the United States, occurring just a few times since World War II. The major reductions came at the end of World War II and the Korean War. Private  sector jobs increased after both of those wars, but the gains were driven by many factors, including the return to a peace-time economy and the demobilization of millions of soldiers, many of whom went directly into the private work force.

During larges stretches of the 1980s and 1990s government spending grew at a slower rate than the overall economy,and large job growth occurred. But economists told us there is a not a direct link between spending policies and job policies.

Let’s review.

Organizing for America’s Virginia chapter said the GOP spending plan could ""cut nearly a million jobs,"" basing these estimates on a report from Scott Lilly, a budget expert at the liberal Center for American Progress.

Other economists, including Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, believe the impact of the spending cuts would be much smaller. And Republicans have brought forward a number of economists who say spending reductions would increase employment.  

Democrats -- and the economists they cite -- may be right when they say the GOP’s proposed  cuts would cost large numbers of jobs. But they are basing their reports on economic projections, not guarantees. Just as we said when House Majority Leader Eric Cantor declared lower spending would create more private sector jobs, no one knows for sure.

Rep. Steve LaTourette says the government is growing while the economy is shrinking
","
Ohio Senate Bill 5 would restrict collective bargaining for state workers and severely limit it for local government employees.

Rep. Steven LaTourette says won't endorse the bill as written, although he doesn’t have a say in it since it’s a bill in the state legislature.

""Being a lawyer, I've never seen the legal system more efficient than sitting down and negotiating over wages and benefits,"" the former Lake County prosecutor said in an interview March 4 with The News-Herald.

Even so, he said, ""I get the fact that we're going to look inward and there seems to be a disconnect between public employment and private employment. If you look at the jobs lost in the private sector as opposed to the job gains in the public sector, it's out of whack. The government's growing and the private economy's shrinking.""

PolitiFact Ohio was interested because the congressman said something similar last summer, when he asserted that American Recovery and Reinvestment Act did little for private jobs while the federal workforce boomed.

The statement is a popular claim among Republicans criticizing the White House and Democratic congressional leadership. PolitiFact has checked out several variations, including more than one from House Speaker John Boehner, and always concluded that the statement contained some truth but glossed over important information.

We wondered if, and how, conditions had changed.

LaTourette's office told us his comments were based on employment figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and on a February report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service titled ""Job Growth During the Recovery.""

We took benchmark dates from the CRS report, which identifies December 2007 as the start of the recession and June 2009 as the start of recovery.

In December 2007, the BLS database of payroll statistics put total employment in the country at 137,983,000. The job losses that followed did not stop after the recovery started, and employment hit bottom in February 2010. In February 2011 -- the last month for which figures are available --  BLS says there were 130,515,000 jobs.

That's a loss of 7,468,000 from the recession's start.

Employment in the private sector, which BLS says was 115,606,000 jobs in December 2007, also bottomed out in February 2010. The number reached 108,298,000 in February 2011, a loss of 7,308,000 jobs.

Total government employment in December 2007 was 22,377,000, according to BLS. That figure rose during the recession to 22,557,000 jobs in June 2009, but dipped by February 2011 to 22,217,000 -- a loss of 160,000.

The total could be considered deceptive, however, because it includes federal, state and local workers. Budget problems have hit state and local payrolls, but BLS statistics say the federal workforce increased by 99,000 jobs from December 2007 to February 2011.

Where does that leave us?

Almost where we started.

Employment is not the chief measure of a growing or shrinking economy. (The gross domestic product (GDP) is. It has been growing, but too slowly to do much for employment, which is why the CRS report cites a ""jobless recovery."")

But employment is the measure that concerns most people.

LaTourette was correct in saying there are fewer jobs now, in total or in the private sector, than there were before the recession. But an important detail to know for context is that jobs have been increasing, not diminishing, for the past year.

And while there are more jobs in the federal government, even without the temporary census workers who inflated earlier statistics, there are fewer government jobs in total.

LaTourette's statement amounts to a verbal snapshot. But while it’s a recognizable picture, it lacks some important details.

That's why we rate it, just as we have previous similar claims, as Half True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/21/steve-latourette/rep-steve-latourette-says-government-growing-while/
"['Oregon', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Tobias Read']","
Tobias Read says Oregon has one of the highest capital gains taxes in the nation
","
Capital gains taxes have quickly become a hot topic at the state Capitol. Of course, there’s been a buzz surrounding them ever since the gubernatorial campaign in 2010 when now-Gov. John Kitzhaber and his Republican opponent sparred over just how much to adjust the state’s rate.

Now, the jockeying has been left to lawmakers who have crafted at least three bills amending the tax to various degrees. At a recent hearing on the bills, Rep. Tobias Read, who favors something of a moderate approach, noted that having a capital gains tax that can, at the highest bracket, reach 11 percent is a barrier for some.

""Having a rate that puts us near the top or at the top of the list makes it more difficult for us as a state to get to the rest of the discussion about the other great things that are in Oregon,"" he said.

This is something we’d heard before -- that Oregon’s rate was one of, if not the, highest in the nation. But when he said it, it occurred to us, we’d never actually checked to see if that were the case. So we set off to correct that oversight.

To start, we contacted Chris Allanach, a senior economist with the House Revenue Committee (the committee where Tobias made his remarks). Allanach said that to the best of his knowledge, Read was onto something -- not only is it among the highest rates, he said, but ""as far as I can tell, it is (the highest).""

(He did caution that this was set to change pretty soon here. When voters approved Measures 66 and 67, they voted to decrease the top income tax rate from 11 percent to 9.9 percent. That means, as of Jan. 1, 2012, the maximum capital gains tax rate will also be 9.9 percent.)

Allanach cited his source as the Federation of Tax Administrators. We went to that site and looked up a comparative table of state income tax brackets. Indeed, it showed that as of Jan. 1, 2011, Oregon was tied with Hawaii for the highest rate at the upper bracket -- 11 percent.

Generally speaking, a state’s capital gains tax rate is only as high as its highest income tax rate. In fact, states often keep it lower than that as an incentive of sorts, Allanach said. That seemed reasonable, but we wanted to make sure that there wasn’t a state out there that might have an unconventional tax rate.

So, we dialed up Ronald Alt, senior research associate with the Federation of Tax Administrators, and asked if he knew of any states that went higher with their capital gains than they do with their income tax. It turns out one does: Massachusetts.

Massachusetts makes a distinction between short term (those held for less than a year) and long term corporate gains. For the former, the state charges a rate of 12 percent.

Where does all that leave us?

Well, Read was right -- we’re among the highest in the nation. If you don’t count Massachusetts’ system, we tie for the No. 1 spot. Even when 2012 rolls around and the rate drops to 9.9 percent, Oregon will still rank as one of the highest -- second only to Hawaii (and, in some cases, Massachusetts). We rate this claim True.

Correctional officer says Rhode Island has nation's most generous ""good time"" policy for prisoners
","
The practice of granting early release to criminals in prison has come under intense scrutiny in Rhode Island, following the news that Michael Woodmansee is scheduled to be set free this summer, after serving 28 years of a 40-year sentence for murdering his South Kingstown neighbor, 5-year-old Jason Foreman.

Many Rhode Islanders were outraged that Woodmansee’s sentence had been shaved by 12 years and he would soon be released to the community, at age 53.

Among those speaking out against Woodmansee’s release is Richard Ferruccio, a correctional officer who was president of the correctional officers’ union for nine years and was a lobbyist on their behalf at the State House.

On the ""Helen Glover"" show on radio station WHJJ (920-AM), Ferruccio complained that Woodmansee would have served his entire 40-year sentence if ""good time"" provisions had not  allowed him to cut his sentence short. There would be less crime, he said, if criminals were kept in prison longer.

He went on to say that Rhode Island’s ""good time"" provisions were already liberal during much of Woodmansee’s time in prison. Then, in 2008, the General Assembly, with support from prison administrators, made the provisions even more favorable to inmates.

""What we had in Rhode Island prior to then [2008] was one of the most generous ""good time"" bills in the country,"" Ferruccio said. ""What we have now is the most generous, in my opinion, ‘good time’ bill in the entire United States.""

We wondered if Rhode Island really has the nation’s most liberal ""good time"" policies.

In general, ""good time"" refers to days prisoners can cut from their sentences for good behavior. At least 38 states offer prisoners the opportunity to earn ""good time."" Many states, including Rhode Island, also grant additional time off for prison work and successful completion of educational programs.

Supporters of such programs say they are incentives to inmates to stay out of trouble while behind bars and can be part of the rehabilitative process. Educational and vocational programs, they say, prepare prisoners for life on the outside. Opponents say they allow dangerous criminals to go free far too early.

The ""good time"" policy in place during most of Woodmansee’s 28 years in prison granted inmates up to 10 days off per month for good behavior, plus two more days for working in prison.

In 2008, the General Assembly approved  up to five more days per month for those taking classes or participating in programs. That brought the maximum time an inmate can earn to 17 days per month.

The Assembly made the change in part to save money. And it worked. In the first year of the new law, the average population of the Adult Correctional Institutions dropped by 87 prisoners, to 3,773, according to a Department of Corrections report.  

To support his argument that Rhode Island’s current ""good time"" law is the nation’s most generous, Ferruccio supplied a March 18, 2008 survey of state policies, compiled by the Connecticut Department of Corrections. (Rhode Island’s law was changed in May 2008.)  

The Connecticut survey shows that at the time of the survey, Rhode Island fell roughly in the middle of states. Some states, such as Georgia, Hawaii and Idaho, had no ""good time"" provisions. But 13 other states had more generous policies. Arkansas and New Mexico, for example,  granted up to 30 days off a month. California would waive half a sentence for non-violent offenders. Iowa reduced sentences by 1.2 days for each day served. North Carolina granted one day off for each discipline-free day served.

A more recent survey, completed in January by the National Conference of State Legislatures but not yet published, found the awarding of ""good time"" appears to be a growing trend. The survey showed that 14  states appear to be more generous than Rhode Island.

Alabama, for instance, grants up to 75 days off per month for good behavior -- the result is those prisoners who qualify serve about a third of their sentences. Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and New Mexico grant up to 30 days per month.

Rhode Island does have the most generous policy in New England, according to the 2011 survey. Massachusetts allows inmates to earn up to 7.5 days per month for educational and work efforts, Maine offers up to 4 days per month. New Hampshire, Vermont and Connecticut have no ""good time.""

When we apprised Ferruccio of our findings, he said he was more certain about New England.

Ferruccio argues that Rhode Island corrections officials misrepresent the total amount of time prisoners can cut from their sentences because they earn additional time off for completing education and rehabilitation programs. But that’s the case in many states. For instance, prisoners who complete their high school equivalency get an extra 90 days in Arkansas and Kentucky, six months in Indiana.

Alison Lawrence, author of the January survey, says most states allow prisoners to accumulate earned time on top of good time. And there is an overall increase in granting more earned time because states believe it leads to less crime.

(Because of the Woodmansee case, Attorney General Peter Kilmartin says he intends to file legislation to reduce ""good time,"" especially for those who commit heinous crimes.)   

In conclusion, if Ferruccio had limited himself to a New England comparison, he would have had a point. But he didn’t. He said Rhode Island has the most liberal ""good time"" law in the nation. That wasn’t true in 2008. And it’s not true now.

Former Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Marla Stephens says the state pays plumbers, others “much, much more” than public defense attorneys
","
Who deserves the least sympathy: lawyers, politicians … Illinois toll booth operators?

The first group seems to make pretty good coin. But when doing work for the State of Wisconsin, private-practice lawyers who take public defender cases haven’t gotten a raise since 1992.

The fact the so-called ""private-bar rate"" -- $40 an hour -- hasn’t been raised in more than 18 years outraged Marla Stephens, head of the appellate division of the state public defender’s office.

Stephens, who lost in the February 2011 primary election for state Supreme Court, raised the issue at a candidates forum on Jan. 27, 2011, saying:

""The State of Wisconsin pays attorneys that it hires much, much more than $40 an hour in every other case. The State of Wisconsin pays plumbers that it hires and engineers that it hires much, much more than $40 an hour to do work for the state.""

OK, we’ll pause here for this acknowledgement: Stephens’ claim was made weeks ago, before that little budget-repair bill from Gov. Scott Walker caught our attention. But her claim still stands and it provides some insight into how the state provides legal representation for poor adults who are facing jail or prison.

First, a little background.

The Legislature created the state public defender’s office in 1978. Public defenders, who are state employees, represent the indigent in every county in Wisconsin. They mostly handle adult criminal cases, but they also work civil matters such as paternity cases.

At the time, the Legislature created a two-tier pay system for private-practice attorneys who put themselves on a list to be assigned cases by the public defender. The hourly rates peaked in 1992 -- $50 for in-court work and $40 for out-of-court work. The current, single rate of $40 an hour has been in place since 1995.

Despite the lack of raises, some 1,300 private-practice attorneys take public defender cases. In 2010, they handled 53,380 cases, two-thirds of them criminal, according to Deborah Smith, the assigned counsel division director for the public defender’s office.

So that’s the lay of the land. Now let’s examine what Stephens said.

Her first claim was:

The state pays private-practice attorneys ""much, much more than $40 an hour in every other case.""

We asked Stephens’ campaign manager, Jon Lipshutz, for evidence to support her two claims. On this point, he cited two Milwaukee Journal Sentinel articles.

An August 2009 article said a Madison attorney was paid $175 an hour to represent the state in a lawsuit over the state’s registry for same-sex couples. And a July 2010 article said the state paid another Madison attorney up to $665 an hour in a complex insurance case involving the receivership of Ambac Assurance Corp.

Obviously, those attorneys were paid far more than $40 an hour -- but their cases were considerably different than the typical public defender case.

To get a more comprehensive picture, we went to Carla Vigue, spokeswoman for the state Department of Administration. She said the lowest rate a state agency paid for an outside attorney over the past year was $95 an hour, for legal services to college students.

The state Office of Lawyer Regulation, however, pays what is known as the Supreme Court rate of $70 an hour to attorneys it hires to prosecute lawyer misconduct cases. The Supreme Court rate is also used when judges appoint lawyers to cases for any reason.

So, the lowest rate we could find that the state pays to lawyers for non-public defender cases is $70 an hour. That’s $30, or 75 percent, more than what the state pays for public defender cases.

Stephens’ second claim was:

The state pays plumbers and engineers ""much, much more than $40 an hour.""

Lipshutz confirmed that Stephens was referring to plumbers and engineers hired on contract. He referred us to the state’s VendorNet website but did not provide evidence of what the state pays contract plumbers and engineers.

We again went to the Department of Administration. Vigue said engineers are paid $80 an hour -- twice the rate paid to private attorneys on public defender cases.

Plumbers, meanwhile, are paid the prevailing wage, which varies by county and by the type of job.

Vigue provided plumber rates for Milwaukee, Dane and Brown counties. The lowest rate for typical jobs, in Brown County, is $46.69 -- the basic hourly rate of $31.65, plus $15.04 per hour for fringe benefits.

So, the state does have a rate it pays for certain plumbing jobs that is lower than the $40 public defender rate -- at least if benefits are not considered in the plumber rate.

Of course, Stephens’ larger point is that the amount paid for public defenders should be increased. Two attempts to force this to happen are pending.  

A March 2010 petition asks the Supreme Court to raise the court-appointed rate to $80 an hour and to index it to inflation. And the 2011-2013 state budget request by the public defender’s office asks that the rate be raised to $70, at an estimated cost of $16.4 million per year.

Let’s return to the claim at hand.

Attorney Marla Stephens said the state pays hourly rates to most lawyers, as well as to engineers and plumbers, that are ""much, much more"" than the $40 it pays private-practice attorneys to handle public defender cases. That kind of characterization is subjective. But the rates paid to other attorneys and to engineers are considerably higher. The rate paid to some plumbers is lower, and only when benefits are not included.

"['Rhode Island', 'City Government', 'David Cicilline']","
Cicilline says Providence had “very little” in reserve fund when he took office
","On March 3, Providence’s new mayor, Angel Taveras, released ""staggering"" figures showing that the city has a $180-million structural deficit for this fiscal year and next and has nearly depleted its reserve or ""rainy day"" funds. ""I thought we had a Category 3 hurricane,"" Taveras said. ""This is a Category 5.""

In the wake of that announcement, Taveras’ predecessor, U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, was criticized for leaving the city in poor financial shape and draining reserve funds to balance his last city budget.

Cicilline denied that he had masked an emerging financial crisis in Providence and he defended his accomplishments during his eight years as mayor, saying that, ""When I took office in 2003, we had very little reserves, and we worked very hard to build up our reserves.""

We decided to take a look. We began by asking Cicilline’s communications director, Jessica Kershaw, to provide the basis for the former mayor’s statement.

In reply, Cicilline’s congressional office issued a statement saying: ""When referring to the unreserved fund balance, or rainy day fund, as the attached Comprehensive Annual Financial Report shows, in 2003, when Cicilline took office as mayor, there was $10 million, and the Cicilline administration more than doubled that by building it up to $22 million by 2008.""

Attached to the statement was a page from the city’s audited financial statement for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2010. That page shows Providence had an ""unreserved"" general fund balance of $10.2 million at the end of fiscal year 2003. That total rose to a high of $22.36 million at the end of fiscal year 2008, but it plunged to $2.08 million at the end of fiscal year 2010.

So does $10.2 million represent ""very little reserves""? Well, at that time $10.2 million was just under 3 percent of the city’s $345 million in actual general operating spending for 2003.

Certainly, that’s not nearly as much as the $22.36 million in unreserved fund balance that the Cicilline administration had accumulated by fiscal year 2008 -- about 5 percent of the city’s actual spending that year.

But it’s a whole lot more than the $2.08 million that the Cicilline administration had left by the end of fiscal year 2010 -- about 0.5 percent of the actual spending.

And it looks really good in comparison with the $220,814 that remained in those reserves as of March 11.

But what is the standard for determining whether a city’s rainy day fund is sufficient? Public finance literature often focuses on a 5 percent standard. And this year, the Government Finance Officers Association executive board is recommending revised ""best practices"" that call for the equivalent of two months -- or 16.6 percent -- of annual spending.

With that in mind, did Cicilline have ""very little reserves"" when he had $10.2 million, or about 3 percent?

Gary S. Sasse, the former Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council director and state revenue director who is now financial adviser to the Providence City Council, said, ""I would say 3 percent is marginal reserves. It doesn’t meet the requirement of 5 percent. But it’s better than nothing. It’s better than we have right now.""

City Treasurer James J. Lombardi III, a critic of Cicilline’s financial practices, said that while the 2003 unreserved fund balance fell below  the 5 percent threshold, that doesn’t mean Providence had ""very little"" reserves at the time. ""Clearly, it was a lot more than we have today,"" he said.

Plus, the Cicilline administration had other restricted contingency accounts as a cushion, Lombardi said. And in 2003, the city’s assets included the Dunkin’ Donuts Center, which it later sold. Now, the city has slashed its unreserved general fund balance, depleted restricted contingency accounts and borrowed at least $60 million to balance the budget, he said.

Cicilline has defended his decision to use reserve funds and to borrow money to balance budgets, saying those actions were better than cutting city services and significantly raising taxes. ""It was a judgment that I made that that was the best way to navigate through the worst economy since the Great Depression,"" he said.

So where does that leave us?

Certainly, it’s true that when Cicilline took office, the unreserved fund balance did not meet the often-cited 5 percent threshold and it fell well short of the 16.6-percent goal that a professional group now recommends.

But it’s a stretch for the former mayor to characterize the $10.2 million he had in 2003  as ""very little."" After all, that’s almost five times what was in the reserve fund in his last year in office.

Given municipal finance standards, there is an element of truth in Cicilline’s claim, but his statement ignores critical facts that would give a much different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, that is the definition of ""Barely True.""

Portland Mayor Sam Adams says Portland’s spent on its bike infrastructure what it would normally spend on a single mile of highway
","

Portland’s biking infrastructure is the stuff of legends. For the people who support it, we’re Biketown U.S.A. -- the city that boasts (at least among medium and large cities) the highest bike commuter rate. For those who are less into that title, our investments in cycling paths and signs are monetary drains on the city budget.

You’d think, then, given the strong feelings, that Portland has made significant investments to get a significant infrastructure.

But something Mayor Sam Adams said recently caught our attention. In a video on Streetfilms.org, Adams touts our biking culture while adding that we built our bike network for about the same amount of cash that a mile of highway would set us back.

""You know in 1993 we weren't the bicycling capital of America,"" he says. ""Seventeen years later, for the equivalent cost of a single mile of freeway, we have a bike infrastructure.""

Could that be true? We checked it out.

Our first stop was the mayor’s office, which forwarded us an e-mail from Roger Geller, the city’s bike coordinator. Geller said that in 2009, the staff set out to put together an estimated total cost for the city’s bike infrastructure in 2008 dollars.

When all was said and done, they came up with an estimated value of $52 million and adjusted it up to $60 million to be safe. Here’s how they arrived at that figure:

""We assumed that all elements that contributed to the city's bikeway system were reasonable costs to include, even if they were not built for the express purpose of creating a bikeway. For example, we included the cost of pedestrian half-signals and bicycle-pedestrian bridges across I-5, among others. These signals and bridges facilitate crossings for existing bicycle boulevards, even though they were in place before the bicycle boulevards were constructed.

""For multi-use trails we split the construction cost of the trail in half and assigned half the cost to pedestrians. For the Eastbank Esplanade I believe we divided the cost into thirds and assigned one-third of the cost to park development, as much of the construction of that pathway was not about transportation but was also about creating a parklike environment.""

To be clear, he added, the network did not actually cost $60 million. It was probably less than that: ""The $60 million figure is essentially the replacement value of our network as it existed in 2008 in 2008 dollars. In other words, if the bikeway network disappeared overnight -- and all the elements that contribute to its functionality, whether built by the city's bikeway program or not -- $60 million is approximately what it would cost to replace it all.""

We called Geller directly to go over the specifics with him, just to make sure we were on the same page. We wanted to be sure that this official estimate included bike-only corridors and other such construction projects.

He confirmed it did, adding: ""I'm very confident in the quality of our estimates.""

The one thing Geller said it didn’t include was city programs that deal with bicycles -- Oregon Safe Routes to School, for example. Even so, the cost of those activities, stretching back to 2004, could be absorbed in the rounding up from $52 million to $60 million, Geller said.

Next up, we needed an estimated cost for a mile of freeway. This is where things get a bit tricky.

The cost of a mile of freeway isn’t easy to pin down. The mayor’s office said Adams was referring to a mile of a typical 4-lane urban freeway. That cost, according to the city’s data, ranges between $20 to $80 million depending on various environmental factors.

They chose $60 million -- the middle road -- to indicate the average cost. ""Of course,"" Geller wrote in the original e-mail, ""it is possible to find examples right here in our region of a single interchange that cost much more than $60 million.""

Their source for that figure was the Rails to Trails Conservancy. That group published the figure in a 2008 report on transportation. We asked the Conservancy for their original source and they sent us a document that offers a considerably wider price range.

According to that document the cost of freeways (in 2006 dollars) breaks down as such:

-Rural areas: $3.1 million to $9.1 million per lane mile; $12.4 million to $36.4 million for a four-lane mile.
-Urban areas: $4.9 miilion to $19.5 million per lane mile; $19.6 million to $78 million for a four lane mile.
-Areas with severe restrictions: $16.8 million to $74.7 million per lane mile;  $67.2 million to nearly $300 million for a four-lane mile.

We tried to get some official estimates from the U.S. Department of Transportation, but they did not respond to our inquiry. Still, the numbers that the Conservancy reported seem to match other estimates, such as this one from the Michigan Department of Transportation.

So, where does that put us with our ruling?

It seems to us that Geller’s estimate of the total value of the bike infrastructure is somewhat inflated. When Adams used this statistic he didn’t make clear that he was talking about an urban four-lane freeway. But, certainly, $60 million in bike infrastructure is well above the $12.4 million it would take to make a mile of four-lane rural freeway.

That said, Adams is the mayor of an urban area and it makes sense that he would be thinking in terms of the cost of urban freeway construction. When you’re talking about that sort of freeway construction, $60 million falls pretty near the middle of the $20 million to $80 million estimated average cost.

The mayor could have been a little more exact, but his statistic -- that Portland has spent on its bikeway infrastructure what it would spend on a mile of freeway -- seems to stand up to scrutiny. We’ll give this one a Mostly True.

Charlotte city councilor: pieces of 9/11 planes haven't been produced
","Never mind that TV stations aired live footage of a plane striking the World Trade Center on 9/11. Or that there are thousands of witnesses who also saw the planes strike the Twin Towers. Or that Osama Bin Laden took credit for the attack. LaWana Mayfield, a Democratic Charlotte city councilwoman, is apparently unconvinced that planes struck the towers and caused them to collapse. In fact, she’s skeptical that pieces of the plane exist at all. On Facebook, Mayfield recently posted a link to an obscure website promoting the idea that the towers in New York City may have fallen on Sept. 11, 2001, for some reason other than being struck by airplanes. ""I am still waiting for someone to produce pieces of the alleged plane that opened the doors for US Citizens to loose all privacy rights (from the conspiracy theorist in me),"" she posted. Mayfield later apologized for posting comments that caused ""hurt and pain,"" but has declined to acknowledge that planes were responsible for the collapse of the Twin Towers. She appeared on the WCNC show ""Flashpoint"" to discuss the post. When asked directly about the post – ""Do you believe the planes took down those towers?"" – Mayfield dodged the question. ""What I believe is that we lost Americans during this event. What I believe is that after this event, our nation identified a segment of our community and said this community is now terrorists. And from that moment, we have been saying 'terrorists, terrorists, terrorists,' "" Mayfield said. But, she added, ""white Americans who have committed mass killings since that time"" were not called ""terrorists."" It’s unclear what, exactly, Mayfield believes happened on 9/11. She didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. When reached by phone Wednesday, Mayfield said the email likely went into a folder she created for 9/11-related emails and that she hadn’t seen it. She then declined to comment on her Facebook post, saying she was walking into a meeting. The ""three-day news cycle"" has passed, Mayfield said, adding ""I’m trying to tackle this housing crisis."" It is clear, however, that planes hit the Twin Towers and caused them to collapse. Let’s break this down as simply as possible. The plane There are eyewitnesses who saw the planes hit the towers. News cameras also captured footage of the second plane hitting the south tower. Large pieces of the airplanes were found around Ground Zero, as documented by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in 2002. A piece – part of a plane wing – was found nearby in 2013. CNN uploaded video of the wing removal. A fragment of one of the planes is on display at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum in New York. Researchers at Popular Mechanics Magazine published a book debunking theories that the planes weren’t actually planes, but missiles or something else. The collapse Conspiracy theorists have argued that jet fuel can’t melt steel beams, so the Twin Towers couldn’t have fallen over due to the impact of a plane alone. But the fuel doesn’t need to melt the beams in order to damage their structural integrity. Furthermore, the World Trade Center was built with a load-bearing core in its center (as opposed to concrete columns). But that center, the Washington Post pointed out, was surrounded by a ""thin exterior shell — a density of eight to nine pounds per cubic foot. That’s lighter than balsa wood."" The Facebook post Mayfield paired her comments about 9/11 with a link to an obscure website, AwarenessAct.com. The site boasts about a feature in the July-August 2016 issue of Europhysics News magazine examining the likelihood that the Twin Towers collapsed as a result of a controlled demolition. According to fact-checking website Snopes.com, the article was written by ""a group of scientists who have long been involved with the promotion of 9/11 conspiracy theories."" EDP Sciences, which produces Europhysics News, later released a statement on Twitter that downplayed the scientific legitimacy of the article. ""EDP Sciences follows the most rigorous peer review standards for its journals of which [Europhysics News] is not one,"" the statement reads. ""As a magazine, the editorial policy of EPN is to publish news and views, which are sometimes controversial. EDP Sciences recognizes that the article discusses some speculative and controversial issues,"" the statement continues. ""However EPN and EDP Sciences believe that the best (and the most scientific) way to settle such issues is to publish them and have an open discussion with all due arguments in which the truth will finally emerge."" Our ruling Mayfield described the planes that hit the World Trade Center on 9/11 as ""alleged"" planes and said pieces of the planes had yet to be revealed to the public. Eyewitness accounts, video, plane debris and most credible science points to the fact that airplanes struck the Twin Towers on Sept. 11, 2001, causing them to collapse.

Are people of color arrested more often for marijuana in New York?
","Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand says legalizing marijuana would benefit communities of color, particularly in New York City. Gillibrand says people of color are arrested for marijuana possession at a much higher rate than white people, despite similar marijuana use. ""Black and Latino people in NYC are arrested at TEN times the rate of white people for virtually the same rate of marijuana usage,"" Gillibrand tweeted. New York state is exploring the possibility of legalizing marijuana for recreational use. The state Department of Health has begun a study on how legalization would affect residents. So are blacks and Latinos arrested ten times as often as white people for marijuana? New York City data Gillibrand relied on data from a February article published by Politico New York, which cited data from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services. The agency provided that data to us for this article. The numbers confirm Gillibrand’s claim: Eighty-six percent of people arrested for criminal possession of marijuana in New York City last year were either black or Hispanic. Five percent were classified as ""other"" by the agency. Nine percent of those arrested were white. The agency tracked 17,880 total criminal marijuana arrests in New York City last year. Almost half of the people arrested — 8,565 — were black. Some 6,853 were Hispanic and 890 were identified as ""other."" Only 1,572 of the offenders were white. There are a few caveats to the data. For one, it doesn’t include every marijuana arrest in the city. The data only tracks arrests for burning marijuana in public or possessing more than 25 grams at a time. More severe crimes, like selling marijuana, are not included in the numbers. The data also excludes cases where a more serious crime was involved. For example, if marijuana was found on someone pulled over for driving while intoxicated, the agency would not report the drug possession in this dataset. Statewide data The gap is not as wide outside New York City, state data shows. There were 5,417 of the same type of marijuana arrests upstate and on Long Island in 2017, according to the data. Of those, about 31 percent were white, 37 percent were black, and 25 percent were Hispanic. The remaining arrests were marked as ""other."" That still means about two-thirds of those arrested for marijuana possession outside New York City were people of color in 2017. Marijuana use by race Gillibrand also said the rate of marijuana use is the same regardless of race. The Politico article cites data compiled by the American Civil Liberties Union to support that claim. Fourteen percent of blacks and 12 percent of whites reported using marijuana in the past year in 2010, according to federal data. The ACLU analyzed data from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program and the U.S. Census Bureau.  Jon Gettman, an associate professor of criminal justice at Shenandoah University, used the same data to calculate more recent numbers for this article. About 14 percent of whites and 16 percent of blacks reported using marijuana in the past year in 2016. Data previously compiled by Gettman for the Brookings Institution showed the rates of use by whites and blacks have been about the same since at least 2001. Our ruling Gillibrand said blacks and Latinos in New York City are arrested at 10 times the rate of whites for marijuana possession, despite using it at about the same rate as whites. State data proves Gillibrand’s claim. Nine percent of people arrested for marijuana possession in the city last year were white versus 86 percent that were black or hispanic.

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.

The ban was part of the annual USDA funding bill and was renewed a year at a time until it expired in 2011. In 2011, Congress lifted the five-year-old ban on funding horse meat inspections in a spending bill that former President Barack Obama signed into law.

Greg Abbott claim about border apprehensions, heroin seizures light on factual backup
","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says that apprehension of border-crossing immigrants and drugs have increased dramatically from last year, justifying his decision to step up National Guard troops assigned to the Texas-Mexico border in keeping with President Donald Trump’s desires. Abbott said in an April 9, 2018, interview with Trey Ware on San Antonio’s KTSA radio station: ""People must understand the math behind what is going on and that is this: And that is from this March, being last month, compared to last year, there’s been a more than 200 percent increase in the number of people who are apprehended coming across the border. And I’ll tell you this, there’s been more than a 200 percent increase in apprehension(s) of heroin coming across the border. This is real dangerous stuff that we must get control of before we further lose control of our border."" We were curious about those stats, so we asked the governor’s campaign for backup. We didn’t hear back. Next, we turned to government-posted border and heroin apprehension figures, focusing first on apprehensions of people. Counting border apprehensions Apprehension counts--often cited as an indication of illegal border crossings--are regularly posted by Customs and Border Protection, the part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security primarily responsible for regulating the movement of people and goods across U.S. borders. Generally, the number of people detained in the Border Patrol’s Southwest region, which runs from Brownsville, Texas, to San Diego, Calif., has mostly decreased since 2005, according to a CBP document we checked that provides such details for every year since 2000:                SOURCE: Web page, ""Total Monthly Apps by Sector and Area, FY2000-FY2017,"" Customs and Border Protection, undated (accessed April 10, 2018) But Abbott’s claim to KTSA was limited to comparing the number of individuals apprehended near the border in March 2018 with the tally of individuals detained the same month the year before. We confirmed a more than 200 percent difference in apprehensions for the chosen months. That’s partly because the 2017 count was historically low. In March 2018, a CBP chart indicates, Border Patrol agents apprehended 37,393 individuals near the border. That was up 207 percent from the agency’s March 2017 apprehension of 12,195 individuals along the border. But the chart shows, too, that that the March 2017 count was down 64 percent from March 2016--and the lowest for any March from 2000 on:                SOURCES: Web pages, Customs and Border Protection,  ""Total Monthly Apps by Sector and Area, FY2000-FY2017,"" undated; ""Southwest Border Migration FY2018,"" last published April 4, 2018; ""CBP Enforcement Statistics FY2018, undated (accessed April 10 and 19, 2018) We sought an independent fix on recent changes in apprehensions by comparing the CBP figures covering the first half of fiscal 2018, through March of this year, with the same stretch of fiscal 2017. According to those figures, there were 173,599 apprehensions along the southern border in the first half of fiscal 2018--down some 13 percent, we calculated, from the 199,171 border region apprehensions in the first half of fiscal 2017. We also asked Carlos A. Diaz, chief of CPB’s Southwest Branch, to address the count of March 2018 apprehensions singled out by Abbott compared with border apprehensions the same month of the year before. By email, Diaz replied: ""The increase and decrease in entries during any given period is determined by ‘push/pull’ factors,"" which, he said, can seem bigger if you compare shorter time periods. ""These factors,"" Diaz wrote, ""vary by country of origin (push) and by perceived policy changes in the U.S. (pull). In 2017, there was the perception by individuals wishing to enter illegally into the U.S. that there would be immediate policy changes to how the U.S. handled illegal immigration. This perception was due in large part to the newly elected President Trump’s proclamation on enforcing immigration laws."" Diaz, asked if CBP believes there’s been a fresh surge in people illegally trying to enter the U.S. from Mexico, reminded us of the big percentage differences between apprehensions in March 2017 and March 2018. In his April 2018 reply, he further said: ""The current entry numbers are following statistical norms when compared to years 2014, 2015 and 2016."" Heroin seizures Next, we sought information speaking to Abbott’s heroin statistic. Mexico remains the primary smuggling route for increased heroin reaching the U.S. and, the Drug Enforcement Administration says, opium poppy cultivation in Mexico has increased in recent years, according to the agency’s 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment. That report says federal seizure data also indicate a shift of heroin transportation through the U.S.-Mexico border and away from commercial air routes, ""the method most commonly used by traffickers of South American and Asian heroin."" In 2008, the report states, 47 percent of CBP heroin seizures were made from air conveyances and 49 percent were made on land. In 2016, the report says, 14 percent were made in the air and 82 percent on land. ""This increase is primarily due to the more prominent role Mexican traffickers have taken in the United States heroin market, and also partially due to increased law enforcement presence on the Southwest Border,"" the report says. Our look for figures specific to Abbott’s claim led us to a couple of CBP charts--one showing the Border Patrol lately on pace to capture fewer pounds of heroin than before and the other indicating a national spurt in heroin seizures by the agency. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, through March 2018, the Border Patrol reported seizing 263 pounds of heroin near the southern border--which, we gauged, breaks out to 28 percent of the 953 pounds of heroin seized along the border by Border Patrol agents through the entire previous fiscal year, from October 2016 through September 2017. The second chart states that CBP’s Office of Field Operations reported seizures of 2,479 pounds of heroin in the first half of fiscal 2018--which breaks out to nearly 70 percent of the 3,626 pounds of heroin seized by that office through all of fiscal 2017, possibly an indication that far more heroin will ultimately be seized through the full year. A note: We saw no indication on the chart of where the office’s seizures took place--on the border or elsewhere.                SOURCE: Web page, ""CBP Enforcement Statistics FY2018,"" Customs and Border Patrol, undated (charts fetched April 19, 2018) To our inquiry, Melvin Patterson, a DEA official, emailed a breakdown showing annual heroin seizures in the border region by law agencies, though the information wasn’t up to date. According to the breakdown, the 2,443 kilograms in heroin seizures along the border in the fiscal year running through September 2016 ran short of the 2,855 kilograms seized there the previous fiscal year; it also ran behind the 2,559 kilograms seized in fiscal 2014. Patterson said the government had yet to post relevant data for October 2017 and beyond. It could be that Abbott reached his seizures’ percentage based on information from the Texas Department of Public Safety. We queried DPS, but the agency didn’t respond. Our ruling Abbott said that as of March 2018 compared with 2017, ""there’s been a more than 200 percent increase in the number of people who are apprehended coming across the border. And, I’ll tell you this, there’s been a more than 200 percent increase in apprehension(s) of heroin coming across the border."" This claim has an element of truth in the 200-plus percent escalation in apprehensions when you compare the chosen months, though it’s worth noting that the percentage starts from border apprehensions in March 2017 setting an 18-year-low. Meantime, we found, border apprehensions in the first half of fiscal 2018 trailed apprehensions in the comparable stretch of 2017. We didn't find evidence that border heroin seizures have lately increased more than 200 percent. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Are most of our taxes spent on the war on terror? No
","A recent Facebook post by Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., made an incorrect assertion about the scale of military spending in the federal budget. When PolitiFact contacted Khanna’s office, the congressman personally emailed us to say he was fixing the post — which happened before we could publish our fact-check. Our reporting started when a reader asked us to fact-check the April 19 post on Khanna’s Facebook page. Khanna’s post shared a graphic that was headlined, ""Your Taxes Are Going to War."" The post was attributed to the National Priorities Project, an effort sponsored by the liberal Institute for Policy Studies, but the group said it is not responsible for the graphic.  The part that caught our eye was Khanna’s personal comment alongside the graphic: ""Republicans mention ‘fiscal responsibility’ when talking about cutting SNAP and Medicaid, even though most of our taxes are spent on the so-called ‘War on Terror’ which has sacrificed countless lives. It’s time to change our priorities."" Here’s a screenshot of the original post.   Our policy is to acknowledge and applaud after-the-fact corrections by speakers we check, but we still put the original comment to the Truth-O-Meter. So we’ll do that here. One tricky aspect of checking Khanna’s statement is that the federal budget does not cleanly separate ""War on Terror"" spending from overall national defense spending. Under a simple but admittedly generous definition, we assumed that the entirety of spending on national defense went to the ""War on Terror."" The reality is that many aspects of the federal military budget — from nuclear weapons to troops stationed in South Korea to the U.S. Marine Corps band — are far removed from the front lines of the ""War on Terror."" (Khanna offered us an even more expansive estimate that include veterans services, the State Department and other agency spending, but we decided to stick with our definition.) Another tricky aspect is that Khanna referred to ""our taxes."" It’s not always easy to determine what ordinary Americans pay in federal taxes. Obviously they pay income taxes directly, but many taxation specialists would say that taxpayers indirectly foot the bill for corporate taxes and for the employer’s share of payroll taxes. For simplicity, we decided to include all tax revenues collected by the federal government, regardless of type. So how does national defense spending compare with federal tax revenues? Federal tax receipts in 2017 totaled $3.3 trillion. By comparison, outlays for national defense totaled $598.7 billion. That works out to 18.1 percent of tax receipts — not ""most"" of our taxes, as Khanna originally put it. ""It is pretty far off the mark to say that the majority of taxes are used for the wars,"" said Todd Harrison, the director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Even if you wanted to expand it as broadly as possible to include all national defense, homeland security, and veterans funding, it still does not add up to half."" In fact, while federal spending on national defense is sizable, it pales compared to social spending. If you add together the two programs Khanna cited — Medicaid and SNAP (what used to be called food stamps) — and further include Social Security and Medicare, those four programs collectively accounted for 60.4 percent of tax receipts, or more than three times the proportion spent on the military. It’s also worth remembering that all federal spending currently exceeds the amount of taxes collected -- that’s what having an annual deficit means. Khanna would have been more accurate if he had clarified that he was talking about ""discretionary spending"" rather than the entire federal budget. What does that mean? There are actually four major types of spending. One type of spending, known as ""mandatory spending,"" is essentially automatic, given to any American who’s eligible based on existing rules and formulas. This category includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. Another type of spending is interest on the federal debt. This spending is also mandatory, but is typically considered a separate category. The two remaining types fall under ""discretionary spending."" The term ""discretionary"" doesn’t necessarily mean less important, but it does mean that such lines of funding must be approved on a more or less annual basis by Congress. All spending on national defense falls into the category ""defense discretionary spending."" And all other types of federal spending — from the Labor Department to the Environmental Protection Agency — makes up the category ""non-defense discretionary spending."" This chart shows that non-defense discretionary spending slightly outpaces defense discretionary spending, but the two are very close. So Khanna would have been closer to the mark if he’d said that national defense spending accounted for about half of discretionary federal spending. That’s what Khanna did when he changed the wording of his post. ""We should have clarified that this was excluding mandatory spending,"" Khanna said in an email to PolitiFact. ""The caption we used is clearly poorly written. We do believe it is the majority of discretionary spending when counting all of the costs of the war on terror — which are beyond defense. ... You were right to bring it to our attention."" The new caption on Khanna’s post reads, ""Republicans mention ‘fiscal responsibility’ when talking about cutting SNAP and Medicaid, even though a majority of our taxes, related to discretionary spending, go to the so-called ‘War on Terror.’ Post updated to clarify that these numbers are related to discretionary spending only — based on PolitiFact's Louis Jacobson’s comments."" Khanna’s original post said, ""Most of our taxes are spent on the so-called ‘War on Terror.’"" That’s close to accurate if you specify that you’re referring to discretionary spending only, but the original post did not do that. To his credit, Khanna pointed out the distinction when he rewrote the post. We applaud the change, but our policy is to rate the original wording, and that earns the initial statement a False.",/factchecks/2018/apr/24/ro-khanna/are-most-our-taxes-spent-war-terror-no/
"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Gwen Graham']","
Did Gwen Graham vote to deny the resettlement of Syrian refugees?
","Gwen Graham’s opponents for Florida governor criticized her during the first Democratic debate over a past vote to put extra restrictions on Syrian refugees. Orlando-area businessman Chris King said the 2015 vote made it harder for Syrian refugees to come to this country (even though it never passed). Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum pointed out how former President Barack Obama was against the legislation. Graham, who served one term in Congress representing north Florida, said her vote on the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act would not have banned refugees from the country. ""That vote was not a vote to deny access to the United States,"" Graham said April 18 in Tampa. ""It was a vote that would only have certified the process that was in place."" Given the pushback from her opponents, we wondered if Graham was right about the effect of the legislation. The SAFE Act did not explicitly deny refugees’ entry to the United States. However, Graham downplayed the new burden it would have placed on the processing of certain refugees that would have slowed the process, likely resulting in at least a pause in admissions. The Republican-controlled U.S. House passed the SAFE Act (HR 4038) in response to the Nov. 13, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris that resulted in more than 130 deaths. The vote was 289-137. Forty-seven Democrats, including Graham, broke from the party and voted for the legislation. The bill never made it through the Senate. Supporters at the time said the bill would increase national security. ""In light of new threats, we must strengthen our vetting process,"" Graham told reporters at the time. ""We must be able to identify those who wish to do us harm, while continuing to offer a safe haven to those in need of refuge from war and persecution."" But opponents including the Obama White House said the bill would in effect prevent Syrian immigrants from coming to the United States. The end of the statement by the White House indicated Obama would veto the bill if it made it to his desk. Slamming the door in the face of refugees would betray our deepest values. That's not who we are. And it's not what we're going to do. So what would this legislation have really have meant for Syrian refugees? Under the existing requirements, experts said refugees experienced a processing time of 18 to 24 months in 2015. Refugees had to undergo a security clearance check that could take several rounds, an in-person interview, approval by the Department of Homeland Security, medical screening, a match with a sponsor agency, ""cultural orientation"" classes, and one final security clearance. The legislation would have added a layer of certification to the process that was in place. It would have required each refugee case to have the sign-off of three agency heads. Here’s a key portion of the text: ""A covered alien may only be admitted to the United States after the Secretary of Homeland Security, with the unanimous concurrence of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence, certifies to the appropriate Congressional Committees that the covered alien is not a threat to the security of the United States."" Had this become law, it would have extended the waiting period for these applications. ""To ask that we have my FBI director make personal guarantees would effectively grind the program to a halt,"" U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a news conference after the bill passed the House. So a more reasonable interpretation of this bill is that it would have slowed down or temporarily paused refugees from coming in to the United States. That is important context in understanding Graham’s defense. ""The bill did not specify how the certification process would work, so DHS, the FBI, and the Office of the National Intelligence Director would be tasked with agreeing on standards—which could take months (and result in a pause),"" said Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute. Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, a nonprofit organization that provides humanitarian aid and assistance to refugees, agreed that nothing in the legislation stopped refugees from coming in. But he said the measure would have crippled the existing program. ""Such a new security layer would have added a major bureaucratic hurdle without value, as it would largely be redundant to the existing (checks),"" he said. The flow of Syrian refugees has decreased significantly since 2016 when the U.S. resettled more than 15,000, according to the Refugee Processing Center. In calendar year 2017, the country let in 3,024 refugees from Syria. So far this year, that number is just 11. A few days into his administration, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to indefinitely suspend the entry of Syrian refugees. A revised order in March 2017 suspended refugee entry for 120 days, but did not single out Syrian refugees for indefinite admission. Refugee admissions eventually resumed under ""enhanced vetting."" In September 2017, Trump also reduced the cap on refugees coming to the United States from anywhere in the world to 45,000. Graham said her 2015 vote for the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act was ""not a vote to deny access to the U.S."" Graham’s take on the legislation requires some context. While it would not have prevented Syrian entry outright, it would have installed a significant new layer of bureaucracy that would have at least delayed their entry. The bill would have required the signature of three agency heads for each case, an extraordinary hurdle on top of previous requirements.

Bernie Sanders says US military spending is bigger than the next 12 nations combined
","A ""moral economy"" means spending more on things like health care and education and less on the military, according to Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders, a Vermont independent and Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, shared a stage with the Rev. William Barber II at Duke University in Durham on April 19 to talk about systemic inequality during their event to honor Martin Luther King Jr. To drive home his point about U.S. defense spending, Sanders said, ""We’ve spent more money on the military than the next 12 nations combined."" ""That,"" Sanders added, ""you will never hear in the media."" Be careful what you ask for, Senator. A familiar claim PolitiFact has checked claims about military spending before. And if Sanders’ claim sounds familiar, that may be because President Barack Obama made a similar claim during his 2016 State of the Union address. ""We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined,"" Obama said. It’s been two years since we rated Obama’s claim Mostly True on our Truth-O-Meter.   At the time, PolitiFact relied on the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a think tank, for information to rate Obama’s claim. By that group’s calculation, the United States in 2014 — the most recent year available at the time — spent more than the next seven countries combined. Updated SIPRI numbers show that the United States spent $611 billion in 2016, more than eight other countries combined — but not 12. The institute hasn’t released numbers for 2017. So does that mean Sanders is exaggerating? A year late Sanders’ office, upon being contacted by PolitiFact, cited as his source a 2016 report by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. The 2016 report shows that the United States spent about $604.5 billion on its military, which indeed is higher than the next 12 countries combined. China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, India, Japan, France, Germany, South Korea, Australia, Brazil and Italy spent a combined $601 billion in 2016. However, the most recent IISS report shows the U.S. spending is ahead of the next 10 countries. The United States spent $602.8 billion, while the next 10 countries spent a combined $593 billion. The change in ratio has more to do with foreign countries than it does with the U.S. military budget. While U.S. spending dipped slightly, Saudi Arabia boosted spending by nearly $20 billion. China and Brazil increased spending by about $5 billion apiece. PolitiFact alerted Sanders’ office to the updated IISS numbers. ""We will update our talking points,"" Sanders spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis said. Our ruling Sanders said the U.S. government has spent ""more money on the military than the next 12 nations combined."" He cited a 2016 chart that supported his claim, but it has been updated recently to a new pecking order of military spending. Still, Sanders’ claim is in the ballpark.

Middle-class tax cuts as weapon in Nevada Senate race

Heller’s campaign announced its latest attack on Rep. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., in a press release on tax filing day. ""Heller campaign releases new digital ad on Jacky Rosen’s reckless promise to repeal middle-class tax cut,"" the campaign wrote on April 17. The Heller campaign ad consists mainly of broadcast clips of reporters giving examples of companies that announced bonuses and raises for workers. But it closes by saying Rosen ""wants the tax bill repealed,"" and includes a clip of a newscaster saying ""Nevada Congresswoman Jacky Rosen wants the recently passed GOP tax bill repealed."" The Heller campaign said that report was about a Las Vegas event held by the advocacy group Not One Penny. The event was part of a nationwide protest against the Republican-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and Rosen participated. The group billed the national action as the ""Repeal the Trump Tax Tour,"" saying the new tax law ""will raise taxes for 92 million middle-class families, rip health care away from 13 million people, and threaten life-saving programs — all to give tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations."" According to the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings, 90 percent of middle-income households would pay less in 2018, but those savings largely disappear by 2027, except for the top 1 percent of earners. For its stop in Las Vegas on Jan. 15, 2018, the group called on Republicans to ""repeal the Trump Tax on middle-class Families,"" as the group’s press release put it. We watched the full video of the event. Rosen left no room for doubt that she opposed the Republican tax cuts. ""This tax bill at its core is a giveaway to special interests and the wealthy,"" Rosen said. ""And it will disadvantage millions of working families in the long run. In 10 years, by 2027, more than half of all Americans will pay more in their tax bill."" Rosen said the bill was ""out of balance,"" but stopped short of calling for full repeal. ""We must come together to use common sense to fix this reckless tax bill and protect our families against long-term damage,"" Rosen said. While the news report quoted in the Heller ad said she called for repeal, Rosen herself didn’t say that. A search of the Nexis news database and of Rosen’s Twitter accounts reveals no mention. Nor could the Heller campaign provide any examples. Heller campaign spokesman Keith Schipper said, ""Rosen never made it a point to say she just wanted to change part of it and keep other parts."" In a March 27 op-ed, Rosen said she supports middle-class tax cuts and chastised Heller. ""If Sen. Heller and Republicans had really wanted to give a tax cut to working families, why not give them a bigger, permanent tax cut directly instead of relying on trickle-down economics?"" she wrote. Heller said that Rosen promised to repeal middle-class tax cuts. The Republican tax law provides immediate tax relief to middle-class families, though those savings expire without further action for all but the highest earners. Rosen spoke at an event that called for repeal of what they called the ""Trump Tax"" on the middle class. However, Rosen said the law should be fixed; she did not say it should be repealed. As a point of policy, both Rosen and the organizers of the event where she spoke support middle-class tax cuts, but not the package passed by Republicans. There’s some nuance here, but Rosen didn’t vow to repeal the current tax law. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/apr/24/dean-heller/middle-class-tax-cuts-weapon-nevada-senate-race/

Do 1,700 families generate 80 percent of crime in Mobile, Alabama?
","Alabama state Sen. Bill Hightower raised a few eyebrows during a debate among Republican candidates for governor when he traced a large portion of crime to a small portion of families in Mobile. Joining Hightower at the April 18 debate were Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle and evangelist Scott Dawson, all of whom are hoping to replace incumbent Gov. Kay Ivey as the Republican nominee after the June 5 primary. Ivey, who stepped into the role after former Gov. Robert Bentley resigned, did not participate in the debate. One AL.com reader asked the candidates, ""As the mom of a third grader who had a classmate say he would bring a gun to school, what will you be doing to keep our kids safe?"" Hightower proposed placing police officers in schools so that they got to know students and prevent crime. ""We know who the difficult students are, more often than not, through their truancy and through their actions,"" Hightower said. ""In Mobile, it’s something like, 1,700 families generate 80 percent of the crime. We know who those families are."" Mobile has a population of about 193,000. Is a small fraction of families generating a majority of crime? Not so fast. It sounded like Hightower was talking about the outsized effects of organized crime in Mobile. But Hightower’s campaign told us he was citing a statistic about school suspensions. That statistic is 15 years old and is the latest study available. In 2003, the Mobile County district attorney researched school suspensions and found that of the 65,000 students in the district, only 1,500 students were responsible for 75 to 80 percent of serious school infractions. The district attorney then cross-referenced the students with home addresses to identify 1,200 households. The office did not study all of the reasons for a suspension, just those that were considered serious — such as burglary or having drugs or weapons on campus. John Tyson, the former district attorney who did the research, emphasized the behavior did not constitute crime under a criminal justice definition. Tyson said there is not a similar data point for more recent years. Still, criminologists were not surprised by the finding. ""The general idea that a few people are engaged in a lot of problem behavior and criminal behavior makes a lot of sense and would be consistent with what we see with a lot of other types of crime,"" said Adam Lankford, an associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Alabama. Sexual assault on campus came to mind, where the number of reported incidents often heavily outweighs the number of offenders. ""A small percentage of the population is responsible for a large percentage of crimes. The same is true of families as criminal behavior often runs within families,"" said James Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University. Lankford took issue with Hightower’s description of the role of families. While social factors play a role in problematic behavior, the research identified correlation, not causation. It did not place blame on a small proportion of families for crime. In fact, Tyson warned against using the word ""crime"" to describe the behavior, as the research looked at addressing school suspensions and absences to address potential future crime, not actual crime. Tyson said the research was not very relevant for his office. But he did use it as a starting point for the ongoing Helping Families Initiative, which he continues to lead. The initiative pairs K-12 public school students who are identified as at-risk for crime with law enforcement and community resources, such as child services, public health officials and domestic violence experts. The aim is to reduce misdemeanors committed on campus and other criminal acts. The program is active in six districts, including Mobile. Hightower said, ""In Mobile, it’s something like, 1,700 families generate 80 percent of the crime."" Hightower’s point is roughly related to available research. But he did not describe it correctly. He oversimplified research findings of the Mobile County District Attorney’s office about school suspensions. The office learned kids from 1,200 households were responsible for 75 to 80 percent of school infractions in Mobile’s public schools. It did not go so far as to examine the role of the families in those households. Also, it’s important to know the research was from 2003, and we don’t know if the percentage still holds up. And importantly, the study centered on school suspensions and not ""crime,"" in a literal or legal sense. Because the statement is partially accurate but missing critical context, we rate this statement Half True.",/factchecks/2018/apr/23/bill-hightower/1700-families-generate-80-percent-crime-mobile-ala/
