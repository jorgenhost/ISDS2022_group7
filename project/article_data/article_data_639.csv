Starbucks exec didn’t say she dislikes white people
","Don’t fall for social posts with the headline ""NEW Starbucks CEO Has Admitted She Doesnt Like White People."" They are not true. For one thing, the executive mentioned in one post, Rosalind Brewer, is the chief operating officer and group president of Starbucks, not the CEO. But the bigger flaw is in its mischaracterization of something Brewer said in 2015, when she worked for another company. In a CNN interview, she expressed a desire for diversity in the workplace and corporate leadership; she never said anything to suggest she has a problem with white people. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) At the time of the CNN interview, Brewer was CEO of Sam’s Club. The interview was primarily about how Sam’s Club employees were affected by various state and city decisions to raise the minimum wage. Near the end of the interview CNN’s Poppy Harlow shifted the conversation.  She pointed out that Brewer, as a black woman, was in a unique position as a minority in a corporate executive role. Harlow then asked Brewer whose responsibility it is to make the decisions that increase representation for women like Brewer in corporate leadership positions. ""It starts with the top of many companies. It has to start with top leadership,"" Brewer said. ""I can tell you that even with myself, I have to live it also. My executive team is very diverse, and I make that a priority. I demand it of my team and within the structure."" Brewer acknowledged that sometimes she considers it her responsibility to use her platform to encourage her partners to think about diversity in hiring. She said she also demands diversity considerations in the hiring process and talks to her suppliers about diversity as well. Then, she brought up one incident in particular. ""Just today, we met with a supplier, and the entire other side of the table was all Caucasian males,"" Brewer said in the interview. ""I decided not to talk about it directly with his folks in the room, because there were actually no females, like, levels down. So I’m going to have to place a call to him."" Brewer did not say she disliked white people in general, or anyone at all. Neither did she identify the supplier in question, other than mentioning which day the meeting occurred. The post also erroneously says Brewer succeeded Howard Schultz as CEO in 2017.  In September 2017, Starbucks named Brewer its group president and chief operating officer. Kevin Johnson is Starbucks president and CEO, and he has been since April 2017. The Facebook post claims that Starbucks’ CEO has ""admitted"" to disliking white people, basing its claim on a CNN interview with Brewer.  In the interview cited, Brewer talks about how she encourages hiring women and minorities for executive roles. She does not say anything about disliking white people. And in reality, she is the chief operating officer, not CEO.  We rate this post False.","[('Daily Political News, ""NEW Starbucks CEO Has Admitted She Doesnt Like White People,"" Dec. 22, 2019', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200218214634/http://dailypoliticalnews.info/the-new-starbucks-ceo-has-admitted-she-doesnt-like-white-people/'), ('CNN Money, ""Sam\'s Club CEO: Wages will keep rising,"" accessed Feb. 18, 2020', 'No link'), ('Snopes, ""Did Starbucks’ Exec Rosalind Brewer Say She Dislikes White People?""

Death hoax about Kobe Bryant’s eldest daughter spreads online
","We have debunked several pieces of misinformation surrounding the tragic deaths of NBA star Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna, and seven others in a helicopter crash on Jan. 26. We’ve noticed a disturbing trend by some websites reporting false suicides of Bryant’s surviving family members. A new one claims to show the BBC reported on the death of Bryant’s eldest daughter, Natalia. The video shows a photo of Natalia with text that says ""R.I.P. Natalia Bryant 2003-2020.""  This is not true.

This photo of an elephant carrying a lion cub is fake
","""It was considered the best photo of this century,"" the best photo’s caption grandly declares.

An elephant realized that the cub would die and carried him in his trunk to a pool of water walking beside his mother. And we call them wild animals."" For a couple years now, the image, which shows a lion cub tucked into an elephant’s trunk as the animal walks alongside a lioness, has been shared widely on Facebook.

Claim 'busts' Melania Trump for touting false credentials
","Claims about first lady Melania Trump lying under oath about her higher education credentials have resurfaced online. The liberal website ""Political Flare"" posted a story in February 2020 about an answer Melania Trump gave during a 2013 court deposition that involved her defunct caviar skincare line.  Its headline: ""BUSTED: Melania Trump Lied Under Oath in 2013 About Graduating From College With a ‘Bachelor’s in Architecture.’"" The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, the headline is accurate, but the news is several years old. Melania previously touted the inaccurate credential on her old website, MelaniaTrump.com, before it was scrubbed in 2016 and its URL rerouted to the Trump Organization website. It now goes to her Facebook page.  Racked, a defunct fashion blog, in 2016 investigated what happened to Melania Trump’s skincare line, which disappeared along with the website. Its report unraveled a tale about multiple lawsuits between multiple rich people. The story included detail from the deposition in which Melania again provided a false account of her educational background. A number of reports found that while Melania gained entry to the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, she dropped out in her first year. Shortly after the 2016 election, a new biography on the future first lady was posted on Trump’s website that said she ""paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris."" The change was noted in a number of news reports.  The current biography of Trump on the White House website does not include anything about her educational background. The 2013 lawsuit that Racked detailed was a result of a business partner feud and the eventual failure of the holding company of Melania’s heavily promoted skincare line that apparently never made it into stores. A screenshot of the court deposition shows that an attorney asks Melania to please ""explain to the Judge your formal education including what schools you attended and from which you graduated?""  ""I attended and graduated from design school, from Fashion and Industrial Design School and also attended, graduated from architecture degree, bachelor degree,"" she responds.  We reached out to the White House but did not hear back in time for publication. Evidence and previous reporting shows that Melania falsely stated she graduated college with a bachelor’s degree while under oath.

Mike Bloomberg’s redlining remarks distorted by Elizabeth Warren
","U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., used the Democratic primary debate in Las Vegas to launch attacks against Mike Bloomberg, including his the billionaire’s rhetoric on the collapse of the housing market and financial crisis. ""When Mayor Bloomberg was busy blaming African Americans and Latinos for the housing crash of 2008, I was right here in Las Vegas literally just a few blocks down the street holding hearings on the banks that were taking away homes from millions of families,"" Warren said. Warren was referring to a statement Bloomberg made in 2008 in which he said that the end of redlining — a discriminatory practice in which banks refused certain applicants, often African Americans, loans to live in certain neighborhoods — contributed to the collapse of the housing market. But Bloomberg did not blame African Americans, Latinos or any minority group. The Warren campaign pointed to what Bloomberg said at a forum in September 2008 at Georgetown University. At various points in the hourlong interview, Bloomberg spoke broadly about loose lending as a factor in the financial crisis. Bloomberg identified pressure by Congress to expand lending after the ban on redlining as one of those causes. The term ""redlining"" comes from when bankers would draw lines on maps indicating poorer neighborhoods where they would avoid offering mortgages. Those areas often include large minority populations. Bloomberg did not talk about the racial aspects of redlining or bring up any minority groups. Instead, he seemed to define redlining narrowly as excluding loan applicants in poor neighborhoods. And he described a system in which, by enacting a ban on redlining, Congress encouraged banks to give mortgages to people whether or not they could afford them. Here’s what Bloomberg said: ""It all started back when there was a lot of pressure on banks to make loans to everyone. Redlining, if you remember, was the term where banks took whole neighborhoods and said, ‘People in these neighborhoods are poor, they’re not going to be able to pay off their mortgages, tell your salesmen don’t go into those areas.’"" He continued: ""And then Congress got involved — local elected officials, as well — and said, ‘Oh that’s not fair, these people should be able to get credit.’ And once you started pushing in that direction, banks started making more and more loans where the credit of the person buying the house wasn’t as good as you would like."" Warren’s argument is essentially that by citing the pushback against redlining as factor in the crisis, Bloomberg was blaming African Americans and Latinos. Bloomberg’s description of redlining may have sounded naive in that he didn’t explicitly acknowledge the discriminatory impact against racial minorities. But that’s a long way from blaming African Americans or Latinos for the housing collapse.  In the same interview, Bloomberg cited several other factors that led to the crisis, but he made no mention at all of minorities. Bloomberg talked about how the mortgage crisis accelerated after mortgages were approved too easily for borrowers who didn’t have the means to repay them.  ""There was pressure to open up the spigot and to sell mortgages to everyone,"" he said. Bloomberg’s eight-minute answer also lobbed criticism at financial companies, saying that they didn’t understand the risks and volatility of their own products. He said that Bear Stearns, AIG and Lehman Brothers all had reputations for being very aggressive. ""They got themselves so far out there that when the mortgage market collapsed, they couldn’t value the things that they owned,"" he said. ""They didn’t know how many mortgages at the very bottom were going to be good."" In 2011, Bloomberg repeated his opinion that Congress was to blame for the crisis, because it ""pushed the banks to loan to everybody."" In this statement, he appeared to let bankers off the hook. ""It was not the banks that created the mortgage crisis,"" he said. ""It was, plain and simple, Congress who forced everybody to go and to give mortgages to people who were on the cusp. Now I’m not so sure that was terrible policy because a lot of those people who got homes still have them, and they wouldn’t have had them without that."" RELATED: What caused crisis? No one thing Many experts have pushed back against the idea that eliminating redlining was a culprit for the financial meltdown. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that the 1977 law against redlining was ""not a significant factor in subprime lending or the crisis."" When we contacted the Bloomberg campaign, the campaign pointed to other statements Bloomberg made in which he mentioned various factors. Speaking in London in October 2008, Bloomberg said that automated trading contributed to the market’s volatility. He said that the United States had an ""antiquated patchwork of regulatory bodies"" that lacked transparency. At that event, Bloomberg was asked to respond to a magazine article suggesting the origins of the subprime mortgage crisis could be traced to the Clinton administration’s anti-discrimination drive that cajoled banks to lend to people who were not creditworthy. Bloomberg said: ""I think it might have contributed a little bit, but what happened was fundamentally everybody was doing well. And when everybody’s doing well, we let our guard down, we take risks that we would not otherwise have taken, and what happened plain and simple is that the modeling said these mortgages were going to be paid off."" Warren said, ""Mayor Bloomberg was busy blaming African Americans and Latinos for the housing crisis in 2008."" Warren makes it sound like Bloomberg made a clear cut statement blaming minorities for the collapse of the housing market, when that’s not the case. Bloomberg in September 2008 brought up redlining when he was asked about the causes of the financial crisis. Bloomberg said after politicians deemed the process of redlining unfair, banks and lenders extended loans to applicants with poor credit.  But Bloomberg made no mention of race or minorities — he spoke about people in poor neighborhoods. Bloomberg faulted other factors in the crisis including inadequate regulation. Warren’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False. ","[('New York Times, Bush drive for home ownership fueled housing bubble, Dec. 21, 2008', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/business/worldbusiness/21iht-admin.4.18853088.html'), ('Washington Post, Clinton pushes homeownership strategy, June 6, 1995', 'No link'), ('Los Angeles Times, Minorities’ Home Ownership Booms Under Clinton but Still Lags Whites’ May 31, 1999', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/06/06/clinton-pushes-homeownership-strategy/f256ec84-dbf2-4a2d-b487-2882fa157da3/'), ('New York Times, Bush drive for home ownership fueled housing bubble, Dec. 21, 2008', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, What caused crisis?

"['Health Check', 'Joe Biden']","
Yes, Mike Bloomberg called Obamacare a disgrace
","UPDATE: This story was updated to include comments from the Bloomberg campaign we received after the story was posted. The comments do not change the rating.  Sparring over health care during the Nevada Democratic presidential primary debate, former Vice President Joe Biden took issue with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s record on the Affordable Care Act. ""From the moment we passed that signature legislation, Mike called it a disgrace,"" Biden said, a claim he repeated another time during the debate.  Bloomberg sought to refute that charge, arguing that he defended the law and believed it should be expanded. It was a heated moment. Both candidates are trying to tie themselves to former President Barack Obama, who spearheaded the 2010 legislation. So we decided to dig in. We reached out to both campaigns for comment. The Biden campaign sent a CNN article, which cited a speech Bloomberg gave at the Dartmouth Presidential Lecture in July 2010 — just a few months after the health care legislation was passed in March. In the speech, Bloomberg called the Affordable Care Act ""a disgrace."" Bloomberg’s campaign directed us to statements he put out in the lead up to the law’s passage, calling for inclusion of a public health insurance option people could buy into.  We found a video of the speech on YouTube. In the video, Bloomberg was unsparing.  ""We passed a health care bill that does absolutely nothing to fix the big health care problems in this country. It is just a disgrace,"" he said. ""The president, in all fairness, started out by pointing out what the big problems were, but then turned it over to Congress, which didn't pay any attention to any of those big problems and just created another program that's going to cost a lot of money."" Those aren’t standalone remarks. As recently as 2014, Bloomberg called the law ""really dysfunctional"" during a talk he gave at the annual meeting of SIFMA, one of the financial industry’s trade groups.  Both times, Bloomberg was still a registered Independent — he didn’t become a Democrat until 2018. It’s also worth noting that Bloomberg wasn’t espousing a minority view. The ACA’s approval rating was underwater until 2017, according to polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the Foundation.) On the debate stage, Bloomberg sought distance from those remarks, saying he is a ""fan of Obamacare."" ""I wrote something supporting it either in the New York Post or the Daily News,"" he said.  Bloomberg’s campaign pointed us to a 2009 New York Daily News op-ed that called for a public option, along with other statements. But those weren’t his only writings on the law.  A March 27, 2017, New York Post piece, for instance, also talks about the ACA. But it comes years after Bloomberg’s mayorship ended. And while words like ""disgrace"" don’t appear, calling the piece a ""defense"" of the law isn’t entirely fair. In it, Bloomberg noted some key shortcomings — for instance, the health law left 30 million people uninsured. He also argued in support of some ideas more popular with Republicans, such as high-risk insurance pools, as a way to bring down costs. ""It’s regrettable that none of these ideas was seriously considered in the rush to repeal ObamaCare,"" Bloomberg wrote at the time. It is worth noting that Bloomberg’s current health care plan would build on the ACA, largely by increasing subsidies for people buying private insurance on the exchanges, and by installing a Medicare-like public option.

Mike Bloomberg's claim of 95% reduction in stop-and-frisk policy needs context
","Mike Bloomberg’s first appearance in a Democratic presidential debate involved him fending off attacks on his record on the stop-and-frisk policy in New York. The former mayor said too many people were stopped and that he’s apologized for it, but he also claimed that stops were cut back drastically once he learned about it. ""What happened, however, was it got out of control,"" Bloomberg said Feb. 19 in Las Vegas. ""And when we discovered, I discovered, that we were doing many, many, too many stop and frisks, we cut 95% of it out."" Stop and frisk didn’t start with Bloomberg, but it did grow significantly under his tenure as mayor from 2002 to 2013. The practice allowed police to stop, question and frisk any person they believed was involved in criminal activity or in possession of a weapon. Data shows that police disproportionately targeted African Americans and Latinos. A federal judge in 2013 ruled that the New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk tactics violated the constitutional rights of minorities in the city. Is it true that stop and frisks dropped 95% during Bloomberg’s tenure? There’s a way to calculate such a reduction. But it’s just one snapshot of the mayor’s 12 years in office. Another snapshot shows stop and frisks rose 600%. The decline during Bloomberg’s later years as mayor came amid a public outcry about the policy and an impending lawsuit challenging the police department’s tactics in carrying it out. RELATED: Mike Bloomberg’s record on stop and frisk His campaign said his claim relied on data for the first quarter of 2012 and the last quarter of 2013. From January to March 2012, the New York Police Department recorded 203,500 stops, compared with approximately 12,500 stops from October to December 2013. That’s close to a 95% drop. What happened in the years before that while Bloomberg was still mayor? The New York Civil Liberties Union compiled data using NYPD’s annual reports and found that, in Bloomberg’s first 10 years in office, stop and frisk numbers increased significantly. In 2002, there were 97,296 stops recorded — that increased more than 600% by 2011, when there were nearly 686,000 stops. Stops fell dramatically in 2013 to just under 192,000. Bloomberg consistently supported the stop-and-frisk policy during his time in office and defended it  for years after. In May 2012, Bloomberg dismissed critics of the practice as a vocal minority. In August 2013, after a federal judge ruled that the NYPD engaged in unconstitutional behavior under the policy, Bloomberg claimed the judge ""ignored the real-world realities of crime"" and that the city did not get a fair trial. ""You’re not going to see any change in tactics overnight,"" he told the New York Times. In July 2013, Bloomberg told the New Yorker: ""I would suggest to the next mayor, whoever it is, that saving lives is the most important thing, more so than pandering. Stop-and-frisk has been shown to be—not the only, but the most effective tool in getting guns out of the hands of kids."" Bloomberg publicly apologized for the policy for the first time a week before launching his presidential campaign in November 2019. Our ruling Bloomberg said, ""When we discovered, I discovered, that we were doing many, many, too many stop and frisks, we cut 95% of it out."" The reduction Bloomberg touted is based on a comparison of data from the beginning of 2012 and the end of 2013, the end of his time in office.  But as Bloomberg himself acknowledged, stop and frisks had ballooned before that period under his watch. The declines toward the end of his tenure came as the city faced public criticism over the policy and a lawsuit that questioned the legality of the police behavior and its impact on minorities. So while there was ultimately a sharp decline, Bloomberg had presided over a sharp increase in stop and frisks for most of his time as mayor. Bloomberg’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.","[('Email interview, Mike Bloomberg campaign, Feb. 19, 2020', 'https://www.nyclu.org/en/stop-and-frisk-data'), ('New York City Liberties Union, Stop-and-Frisk data, Accessed Feb. 18, 2020', 'No link'), ('New York Civil Liberties Union, STOP-AND-FRISK DURING THE BLOOMBERG ADMINISTRATION 2002-2013, Aug. 19, 2014', 'https://www.nyclu.org/en/publications/stop-and-frisk-during-bloomberg-administration-2002-2013-2014')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/20/michael-bloomberg/fact-checking-mike-bloombergs-claim-95-decline-sto/

Sanders’ talking point about Buttigieg's health industry support needs context
","As Pete Buttigieg gained momentum in the Democratic presidential primary race ― finishing second in the New Hampshire primary and a front runner in the Iowa caucuses ― he has increasingly been on the receiving end of shade from his rivals.  The campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for instance, distributed talking points that zeroed in on fundraising, saying ""Pete Buttigieg is a favorite candidate of Wall Street and the health care industry.""  The former mayor of South Bend, Ind., already faced criticism over his ""billionaire donors,"" which famously manifested during the Dec. 19 Democratic debate. It was then that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., described a Buttigieg fundraiser as held in ""a wine cave full of crystals."" Sanders’ comments led us to wonder if Buttigieg really is the sweetheart of the health care industry. We asked the Sanders campaign for its evidence. Staffers pointed us to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that operates the website OpenSecrets.org and tracks money from individuals and political action committees donated to political candidates and members of Congress. The center analyzes Federal Election Commission data and sorts contributions by categories based on the economic sector from which they come. The Sanders campaign used OpenSecrets data it obtained in December 2019. But the OpenSecrets website has since been updated with fourth-quarter filings, so we couldn’t confirm the figures the campaign cited.   Instead, Doug Weber, a senior CRP researcher, pointed to the 2020 presidential race section of OpenSecrets, saying it contains the most accurate data for presidential campaign contributions. It also highlights industry contribution trends focused only on the presidential giving ― in other words, excluding contributions made to Senate campaign accounts. We asked Weber if Sanders’ talking point about Buttigieg is true. That ""depends on what you mean by ‘health care industry,’"" Weber wrote in an email. OpenSecrets defines its health sector by contributions from PACs and individuals working in various health industries, he said, and ""for our data, that's our broadest definition of health care.""   Based on this sweeping categorization, Sanders is ahead of Buttigieg in health sector donations. The Vermont senator received $2,910,894, while the former South Bend mayor trailed closely behind with $2,713,038.  However, when you break down this data by industries within the health sector, Buttigieg comes out ahead of Sanders in contributions from pharmaceutical companies and also for health services/HMOs ― which includes groups like large insurance companies.  But even this point is nuanced. Former Vice President Joe Biden has received the most money of any Democratic candidate from the pharmaceuticals and health products sector if contributions from his leadership political action committee are included. Leadership PACs are committees unaffiliated with campaigns that can still receive contributions and financially support candidates.  In the health care industry categories of hospitals/nursing homes and health professionals, Sanders has received the most in dollar contributions.  When asked to clarify how the Sanders campaign is defining the health care industry, a staffer responded that ""Bernie Sanders issued a pledge to not accept money from top officials of the insurance and pharmaceutical industries (as distinct from rank-and-file workers in those industries, which the aggregate data you cite deals with). He asked other candidates to do the same. Pete Buttigieg has refused to take that pledge, and has instead raised money from those top officials...These clear, demonstrable and verifiable facts makes very clear precisely what we are referring to.""  The Sanders campaign sent us a list of pharmaceutical and health insurance executives that have contributed to Buttigieg, including employees and executives from AbbVie, Aetna, Anthem, Eli Lilly and Co., Merck & Co. and Pfizer. We checked that list against the Federal Election Commission database to ensure its accuracy. In addition, the Sanders’ campaign shared an October 2019 article from Sludge, an investigative journalism outlet focused on money in politics, which estimated Buttigieg’s third-quarter health care industry donations approached $97,000.  We also checked in with the Buttigieg campaign for a response, which replied that ""more than 800,000 Americans"" have donated to its candidate. The campaign’s emailed statement noted that Buttigieg’s ""Medicare for All Who Want It"" plan draws industry attacks because the health system ""will have to provide more affordable coverage and better care or they will lose customers as people enroll in the public option."" It seems the Sanders’ claim is ""imprecise,"" said Robert Maguire, research director at the nonprofit group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW).  ""Given that the health industry itself is vast, what I assume the Sanders’ campaign … meant to say was that the more corporate aspects of the health industry ― like the pharmaceutical industry and the health insurance industry ― were funding Buttigieg disproportionately to others,"" he added.    Michael Beckel, research director of Issue One, a nonprofit organization focused on transparency and enforcement of campaign finance laws, said the key to understanding this claim is that the Sanders campaign is characterizing money from the health insurance and pharmaceutical industry differently than campaign contributions from individuals, such as nurses and other health professionals.  ""Rank-and-file employees in one industry don't always express the same political preferences as executives in that industry,"" Beckel wrote in an email. ""Even as he's railed against the pharmaceutical industry and insurance industry, Sen. Sanders has welcomed support from labor unions representing nurses.""  Michael Malbin, a political science professor at the University at Albany-State University of New York, also took issue with the idea that an individual giving the maximum amount of money to a campaign could sway the candidate’s policies.  ""Every time election season rolls around, there are stories about individuals employed in one industry favoring one candidate over another, and it could be for whatever reason,"" said Malbin. ""But, you cannot make the inference from industry coding … that they are giving just for a certain economic interest. Let alone that it’s remotely enough money to drive a presidential campaign. … It’s a $2,800 maximum, for crying out loud.""   The actual composition of donors in the health category can’t be known without analyzing OpenSecrets’ full data set ― which we could not do since it’s not publicly available. OpenSecrets does, however, analyze the percentage of small donor donations (less than $200) and large contributions for each presidential candidate. And 56% of Sanders’ contributions are from small donors, while 45% of Buttigieg’s campaign contributions come from that same group.   Sanders’ use of the phrase ""health care industry"" in this instance is too broad to support the point he is trying to make. According to recently updated OpenSecrets data, Sanders has received more donations from the health sector than any other 2020 presidential candidate.  However, when the broad ""health sector"" category is narrowed down to pharmaceutical and health insurance companies, which are two targets of Sanders’ campaign, Buttigieg is shown to have received more donations than Sanders. He has also received donations from top pharmaceutical executives ― offering evidence to support Sanders’ claim. But in specifying donations from the pharmaceutical/health products sector, Biden tops Buttigieg when factoring in contributions to Biden’s leadership PAC. Context is also important. It’s likely a large number of Sanders’ health care contributions are from nurses and doctors as individuals. There’s no way to identify whether this support was related to the candidate’s health policies or motivated by other reasons. Sanders’ claim has some truth to it but is imprecise. For this reason, we rate the claim Half True.","[('Email exchange with Bernie 2020 campaign staff, Feb. 10 and Feb. 13, 2020.\xa0', 'https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/7873.php'), ('Telephone interview with Michael Malbin, professor of political science, University at Albany-State University of New York, Feb. 12, 2020.\xa0', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Michael Beckel, research director, Issue One, Feb. 12, 2020.\xa0', 'https://www.issueone.org/staff/michael-beckel/'), ('Email exchange and telephone interview with Doug Weber, senior researcher, Center for Responsive Politics, Feb. 12, 2020.\xa0', 'No link'), ('Telephone and email exchange with Pete for America campaign staff, Feb. 13, 2020.\xa0', 'https://www.citizensforethics.org/team-member/robert-maguire/'), ('Telephone interview with Robert Maguire, research director, Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, Feb. 14, 2020.\xa0', 'No link'), ('Vox, ""Big Tech opponent Bernie Sanders raises more money from Big Tech employees than anyone else,"" Feb. 6, 2020.\xa0', 'https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/6/21125684/bernie-sanders-tech-employees-donations-andrew-yang-amazon-google-facebook-apple'), ('The Washington Post, ""The Technology 202: Bernie Sanders is no friend of Big Tech.

Conspiracy that Buttigieg never served in the military is Pants on Fire!
","After Pete Buttigieg’s strong showing in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, some social media users went after his military record. One Facebook image published Feb. 12 shows the former South Bend, Ind., mayor in a military uniform surrounded by rugs. His arms and chest are highlighted in certain places by red squares. ""No Unit Patch. No Name Tape. No ‘U.S. Army’ Patch. No Deployment/Combat Patch. No American Flag Patch On Right Sleeve. Uniform Clean As a Whistle,"" the post reads. ""This guy is a fraud.""

(Screenshot from Facebook) The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared hundreds of times and copied by several different users. Buttigieg’s military background is part of his argument for becoming commander in chief. He was a Navy intelligence officer in Afghanistan for six months, according to military records sent to PolitiFact by his campaign. Several news outlets have spoken to his commanding officers and fellow soldiers. Buttigieg joined the Navy Reserve in September 2009. He was a lead analyst tracking the flow of money to terrorist cells. Buttigieg did not see any combat, but he did take more than 90 trips outside secured military installations in Afghanistan. Buttigieg was honorably discharged in November 2017. The conspiracy that Buttigieg faked his military experience appears to have originated on 4chan, a fringe forum where users post anonymously. From there, the falsehood spread to Twitter, where conservatives like former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka amplified it. The origin of the photo of Buttigieg in a uniform without military insignia appears to be a 2014 blog post about a column Buttigieg wrote for the South Bend Tribune. The former mayor’s patches are covered up, but there are a variety of photos of Buttigieg serving in Afghanistan that do show patches on his uniform — including one for the International Security Assistance Force, a NATO-led mission. RELATED: The Stump Speech Analyzer: Pete Buttigieg A U.S. Navy official told PolitiFact that Buttigieg could have been working in an environment in which patches were not authorized for some reason.

The story links to a video of the interview, starting about 35 minutes into the 48-minute conversation. Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Ind., talks about how the current Republican Party conflicts with Christian values like helping those in need, and how there will be ""a reckoning"" over it. Then he says:  ""Right now they hold everyone one in line with this one kinda piece of doctrine about abortion, right, which is obviously a tough issue for a lot of people to think through morally.

The host interjects and says, ""I’m pro-choice."" Buttigieg replies, ""Me too.

When attacked for missed votes, Marco Rubio calls out Barack Obama and John Kerry for missing votes
","A major Florida newspaper’s editorial board called for U.S. Sen Marco Rubio to resign because of his record of missed votes in the Senate. The next day, Rubio was asked about it at the CNBC Republican debate in Boulder, Colo. CNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla asked Rubio about the editorial and if he hated his job. Rubio countered that the Sun Sentinel had showed ""bias"" in its endorsements, because a few other senators who ran for president had missed a huge chunk of votes, too. ""Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes. I don't recall them calling for his resignation. … Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes. In fact, the Sun Sentinel endorsed him. In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again. So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement."" What was the voting record of Sens. Obama, Kerry and Graham when they ran for president? We decided to check the roll call, as well as the endorsement record. Playing hooky In 2008, Obama missed 137 out of 213 votes, or 64.3 percent of votes. (His career absentee rate is 24.2 percent.) In 2004, Kerry missed 89.8 percent of votes. (His career rate is 7.7 percent.) That's somewhat higher than what Rubio said. From January to October 2003, which includes the span of his campaign, Graham was absent 37 percent of the time. (His career rate is 3.2 percent.) Graham also underwent heart surgery on Jan. 31 that year, which caused him to miss votes before his official campaign launch. For his part, Rubio has missed 99 out of 291 votes (about 34 percent) from the start of the year to Oct. 22, more than any other candidate in the race, according to Govtrack.us. Rubio recently took the ""most truant career"" sash from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Here’s how Rubio stacks up against the other senator-candidates right now: Senator 2015 votes missed (Jan. 1 to Oct. 28)  2015 absentee rate Career absentee rate Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) 99 34.0 percent 12.3 percent (176 out of 1,434) Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) 79 27.1 percent 5.8 percent 237 out of 4,107) Ted Cruz (R-Texas) 70 24.1 percent 12.0 percent (114 out of 948) Rand Paul (R-Ky.) 14 4.8 percent 3.7 percent (53 out of 1,434) Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) 10 3.4 percent 3.0 percent (84 out of 2,787) Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y., 2001-2009) NA NA 9.5 percent (249 out of 2,616) Rick Santorum (R-Penn., 1995-2006 ) NA NA 1.9 percent (79 out of 4,156)   The newspaper endorsements The Sun Sentinel is based in Broward County, the county with the highest number of registered Democratic voters in Florida, according to state records through September. The Sun Sentinel endorsed Obama in 2008 but endorsed Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. ""When President came into office in 2009, the economy was in freefall and though untested, he inspired us with his promise of hope and change,"" the Sun Sentinel wrote in October 2012. ""Now, four years later, we have little reason to believe he can turn things around."" Graham ran for the Democratic nomination in the 2004 race but was only a candidate for a few months. He filed his papers to form a president campaign committee Feb. 27, 2003, launched his campaign May 6 and dropped out Oct. 6, 2003. We couldn’t find the Sun Sentinel criticizing his voting record. In October 2004, the Sun Sentinel endorsed Kerry: ""The Massachusetts senator possesses a prodigious intellect capable of grasping the complexities of the serious issues facing the nation and the world,"" the Sentinel wrote. The Sentinel’s editorial page editor Rosemary O’Hara, who joined board in 2012, told PolitiFact that as far as Rubio’s endorsement ""We believed him when he said he wanted to work for Floridians in the Senate."" While Clinton and Obama were criticized when they ran for president for missing votes, ""I don't recall either of them complaining about the job,"" O’Hara told PolitiFact. ""By contrast, Sen. Rubio has made it clear he doesn't like the job, which is why he wants another. Also, Sen. Obama and Clinton were not the senators from Florida. Marco Rubio is our guy. We have a personal relationship with him. We have only two people representing us in the U.S. Senate, and he said he wanted to do the job."" Our ruling Rubio said that Obama ""missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes,"" that Kerry missed ""close to 60 to 70 percent"" and that Graham missed ""over 30 percent of his votes"" when they were running for president. Those numbers check out, though Obama’s and Kerry’s numbers were over the course of an election year. Rubio is also correct that the newspaper didn’t call for their resignations. Overall, we rate Rubio’s statement True. Correction: This report has been updated to correct minor math errors in the calculations of voting percentages. Rubio's numbers remain on track, and our rating remains the same.   ","[('CNBC, Republican presidential debate, Oct. 28, 2015', 'http://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/editorials/fl-editorial-rubio-bush-gs1028-20151027-story.html'), ('Sun Sentinel editorial, ""Marco Rubio should resign, not rip us off,"" Oct. 27, 2015', 'No link'), ('Sun Sentinel editorial, ""Choose Kerry,"" Oct. 17, 2004', 'http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-10-17/news/0410141103_1_iraq-al-qaida-bush-administration'), ('Florida Division of Elections, Voter registration, Sept. 30, 2015', 'No link'), ('CNN, Bob Graham Fast Facts, Oct. 16, 2015', 'http://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/voter-registration-statistics/voter-registration-monthly-reports/voter-registration-current-by-county/'), ('PolitiFact, ""Donald Trump says Marco Rubio has worst voting record there is today,"" Sept. 17, 2015', 'No link'), ('Nexis, GOP CNN Debate transcript, Sept. 16, 2015', 'https://www.cnn.com/2013/08/20/us/bob-graham-fast-facts/'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""His eye on the White House, Marco Rubio racks up the worst missed-vote record in the U.S. Senate,"" Aug. 7, 2015', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, ""Ted Cruz, Barack Obama and the biggest vote-missers in the Senate"", May 1, 2015', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/17/donald-trump/trump-says-marco-rubio-has-worst-voting-record-the/'), ('GovTrack searches', 'No link'), ('Senate.Gov searches', 'http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/eye-on-the-white-house-marco-rubio-racks-up-worst-missed-vote-record-in/2240440'), ('Interview, Rosemary O’Hara, Sun Sentinel editorial page editor, Oct. 28, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/oct/29/marco-rubio/when-attacked-missed-votes-marco-rubio-calls-out-b/

Donald Trump didn't realize his own website called Marco Rubio 'Mark Zuckerberg's personal senator'
","During the Republican presidential debate in Boulder, Colo., Donald Trump faced off with CNBC co-moderator Becky Quick over something Trump had supposedly said about one of Trump’s presidential rivals, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Here’s the exchange: Quick: ""You have talked a little bit about Marco Rubio. I think you called him (Facebook founder) Mark Zuckerberg’s personal senator, because he was in favor of the H-1B visa."" Trump: ""I never said that. I never said that."" Quick: ""So this is an erroneous article the whole way around? … My apologies, I'm sorry."" Trump: ""Somebody's really doing some bad fact-checking."" As it turns out, Quick was, uh, too quick to apologize. We looked at the immigration-policy page of Trump’s campaign website and found the following: ""Here are some additional specific policy proposals for long-term reform: ""Increase prevailing wage for H-1Bs. We graduate two times more Americans with STEM degrees each year than find STEM jobs, yet as much as two-thirds of entry-level hiring for IT jobs is accomplished through the H-1B program. More than half of H-1B visas are issued for the program's lowest allowable wage level, and more than eighty percent for its bottom two. Raising the prevailing wage paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give these coveted entry-level jobs to the existing domestic pool of unemployed native and immigrant workers in the U.S., instead of flying in cheaper workers from overseas. This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program. Mark Zuckerberg’s personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities."" And here’s a screenshot we took during the debate:  Quick circled back later in the debate, noting that she got her information from Trump’s website. Trump did not offer a rebuttal. We did not receive an immediate response from the Trump camp. Our ruling In the debate, Trump said he ""never said that"" Marco Rubio was Mark Zuckerberg’s personal senator.

Rubio says more businesses are closing than opening for the first time in 35 years
","Editor’s note, Oct. 30: After we published this fact-check, we learned that the Census Bureau had new data that showed firm births were greater than firm deaths in 2012 and 2013. We revised our rating from True to Half True and archived the earlier version here. In the third Republican presidential debate, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio faced a question about his many missed votes in Congress. The CNBC moderator asked why he didn’t settle down and get more done before running for the Oval Office. Rubio basically said that the country didn’t have time to wait for him. ""Watching this broadcast tonight, there are millions of people who are living paycheck to paycheck,"" Rubio said. ""They’re working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more and they haven’t had a raise in decades. You have small businesses in America that are struggling. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting,"" he said. Rubio has talked about the birth and death of businesses before. It was accurate at one point, based on census data, and we rated the claim True in June 2015. We rated the statement True on debate night as well. An alert reader, however, contacted us to say the census has released more data than we considered in our original report. So we decided to check that out. The U.S. Census Bureau collects data on firm births and deaths as part of a project called Business Dynamics Statistics. The numbers go back to 1977. From that starting point until 2008 and the Great Recession, each year showed more new firms popping up than existing ones going away. In the three years from 2009 until 2011, the trend reversed. There were more deaths than births. The Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, produced a May 2014 report titled, ""Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros."" The authors used the Census Bureau’s data but at the time, the data they used only went through 2011. The most recent data now goes through 2013, and what’s most significant is that in 2012, the tide changed. That  year, the country saw a net gain of about 36,000 firms and in 2013, a small but still positive increase of a bit over 5,000 new firms. We should note that the difference for 2013 is very small. This chart based on the Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics shows the ebb and flow. When the blue line is above the red one, firm births are greater than firm deaths.  We contacted Ian Hathaway, one of the report co-authors. Hathaway confirmed the latest data and provided an updated spreadsheet. ""We now have data for 2012 and 2013 and both show births exceeding deaths,"" Hathaway said. ""Rubio's information is stale."" This is not to say that firms are being born at anything close to the clip the country saw in past years. Between 1978 and 2007 (the recession began December 2007), an average of about 497,000 new firms appeared each year. The average for 2012 and 2013 is about 409,000. So the pace of growth is much slower, but the net figure may not be in the negative territory that Rubio described. The data for 2014 are 2015 is unavailable. It is worth noting that the number of firms closing has remained fairly stable. The average since 1978 is about 390,000 closing each year. In 2013, about 400,000 shut their doors. We reached out to the Rubio campaign and did not hear back. Our ruling Rubio said that ""for the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting."" As recently as 2014, researchers came to that conclusion looking at Census Bureau data from 2009-11. That’s the information Rubio likely relied on in making his claim. But more up-to-date Census information says the trend has reversed and that in 2012 and 2013, more businesses started then closed. The balance is very tight in 2013 and we don’t have the numbers for 2014 or 2015. We rate this claim Half True.","[('CNBC, Third Republican presidential debate, Oct. 28, 2015', 'https://www.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/bds/data_firm.html'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, Business Dynamics Statistics: Firms', 'No link'), (""PolitiFact, Marco Rubio says for first time in 35 years, 'we have more businesses dying than we do starting', June 2, 2015"", 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/02/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-first-time-35-years-we-have-more-/'), ('Brookings Institution, Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros,\xa0May 2014', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Ian Hathaway, nonresident scholar, Brookings Institution, Oct. 30, 2015', 'https://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2014/05/declining%20business%20dynamism%20litan/declining_business_dynamism_hathaway_litan.pdf'), ('\xa0', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/oct/29/marco-rubio/rubio-says-more-businesses-are-closing-opening-fir/

Chris Christie says Bernie Sanders’s plan is 'to raise your taxes to 90 percent'
","New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie drew chuckles at the Republican presidential debate in Boulder, Colo., when he described the Democratic field as consisting of ""a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist -- and for the sake of me, I can’t figure out which one is which."" He went on to single out Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, one of those three Democratic candidates and a self-described democratic socialist. ""The socialist says they’re going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don’t tell you they’re going to raise your taxes to 90 percent to do it,"" Christie said. That echoed a claim made by Donald Trump at a rally in Richmond, Va., on Oct. 14, 2015. At that rally, Trump called Sanders a ""communist"" and said that tax hikes would come for everyone, not just billionaires. ""This maniac that was standing on (Hillary Clinton’s) right is giving everything away, so she’s following,"" Trump said at the Richmond rally, referring to the Democratic debate the previous night. ""He’s gonna tax you people at 90 percent. He’s gonna take everything. And nobody's heard the term communist, but you know what? I’d call him a socialist/communist, okay? ‘Cause that's what he is."" There’s no doubt that Sanders wants to raise taxes on the richest 1 percent: ""Yes, we are going to ask Trump and his billionaire friends to pay more in taxes. ...We'll come up with that rate. But it will be a damned lot higher than it is right now,"" Sanders said in an Oct. 18 interview with ABC’s This Week. But does Sanders want to tax the average Americans at 90 percent as well? Here, we’ll recap the problems we found with Trump’s claim and address why Christie’s claim was equally problematic. What Sanders has said Sanders hasn’t released a tax plan yet -- the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has a summary of the candidates’ tax plans here -- and we searched Lexis Nexis and CQ and found that Sanders has never explicitly proposed a 90 percent tax rate for billionaires, let alone applying that rate across the board. The confusion may stem from comments Sanders made in May 2015 about the marginal tax rate for the very wealthy. In an interview with CNBC, Sanders he doesn’t think a top marginal tax rate of 90 percent is too high. Before we parse his comment, let’s review what the marginal tax rate means. It’s the tax rate that’s applied to the last dollar you earn. The U.S. tax system is based on tax brackets. Let’s say you were a single filer who earned $410,000 in adjusted gross income last year. The first $9,075 you earned was taxed at 10 percent, the amount from $9,076 to $36,900 was taxed at 15 percent, the amount from $36,901 to $89,350 was taxed at 25 percent, the amount from $89,351 to $186,350 was taxed at 28 percent, the amount from $186,351 to $405,100 was taxed at 33 percent, the amount from $405,101 to $406,750 was taxed at 35 percent, and the amount above $406,751 was taxed at 39.6 percent. (The dollar levels are different for other types of filers, such as couples filing jointly.) In other words, the current top marginal tax rate is 39.6 percent, affecting individuals who make more than $400,000 a year. That’s roughly the threshold to make it into the top 1 percent of incomes if you’re filing as an individual. And even for this sample filer making $410,000, that 39.6 percent tax rate hits only a relatively small amount of their income. The average American never sees marginal federal income tax rates that high. ""If my memory is correct, when radical socialist Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, the highest marginal tax rate was something like 90 percent,"" Sanders said on May 26. (His memory is correct.) ""That's not 90 percent of your income, you know? That's the marginal."" Many on the right and left interpreted Sanders’ comments as advocating for increasing the top rate to 90 percent. The Sanders camp, however, told us the Vermont senator has made it very clear that that’s not what he was saying. And beyond what his camp told us, a review of his past comments — one from 2008, and four more from this year — Sanders doesn’t seem like he’s committed to any figure: • Nov. 5, 2008 on Fox News’ Your World with Neil Cavuto: Sanders said of the top tax rate, ""No, of course, it is not going to be 90 percent."" Pressed by Cavuto for a figure, Sanders said, ""Neil, I’m not going to develop tax policy in a three-minute segment on your show."" • June 2, 2015 on Yahoo! News: In response to host Katie Couric’s suggestion that he proposed taxing the wealthiest Americans at 90 percent, Sanders interjected, ""No, I didn’t. It’s not true. That’s one of these things that seems to be circulating. We haven’t come up with a formal tax proposal. ...Will we raise the individual tax rate for the wealthy? Absolutely, but we haven’t come up with a number yet."" • June 11, 2015 on Charlie Rose: ""We are working right now on a comprehensive tax package which I suspect will for the top marginal rates go over 50 percent."" • Sept. 18, 2015 on CBS This Morning: ""No, I don’t think you have to go up to 90 percent. …I don’t know if you have to go there but we will come up with some very specific ideas."" • Sept. 23, 2015 on CNN New Day: ""If you are extremely wealthy, yes, you are going to pay more in taxes. If you are a large corporation today, by the way, that's stashing your money in the Cayman Islands and not paying a nickel in federal taxes, yes, you are going to be paying taxes."" In short, the most specific figure we found from Sanders on the top marginal tax rate is not terribly specific — ""over 50 percent"" — and it would only affect a tiny fraction of Americans. Nothing is certain but taxing corporations And that’s the point that’s even more problematic with this claim -- who Sanders’ supposed 90 percent tax would affect. Both Trump and now Christie have indicated that essentially everyone will be hit by a 90 percent tax hike. With Trump, this rate would supposedly be levied on ""you people"" in the audience at his rally. Christie, for his part, said Sanders would ""raise your taxes to 90 percent."" But whatever big hike a President Sanders would seek to implement -- and based on his comments it would be something south of 90 percent -- would be targeted mostly at the wealthiest Americans, including hikes to the tax on the largest estates and on trading transactions and an elimination of tax deferrals for U.S. corporations located abroad. The one exception is his call for paid family and medical leave, based on legislation introduced by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., that would require ""just a small increase in the payroll tax"" that would hit everyone, Sanders said on This Week. How small? Employers and employees would chip in an additional 0.2 percent each, bringing the federal payroll tax from 12.4 percent to 12.8 percent. According to a report by Gillibrand’s office, that’s the equivalent of $72.04 per year for the average worker, and $227.40 for the highest wage earners. Beyond this, there’s some doubt that Sanders could achieve his policy proposals without additional tax increases. Indeed, one tax expert cautioned against speculating because Sanders has been so vague about his proposals. ""There is not enough substance to (Sanders’) proposals for anyone to have analyzed them,"" Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said when we checked Trump’s original claim. ""Organizations typically wait until there is a fully formulated plan before they try to model them. Sanders is not anywhere near that point yet."" Our ruling Christie said that Sanders’s plan is ""to raise your taxes to 90 percent."" Sanders hasn’t released an official tax plan, either for billionaires or for anyone else. But based on his previous comments and proposals, the tax policies Sanders is advocating are targeted at corporations and affluent Americans. Sanders has dismissed the notion that he wants to set marginal tax rates for billionaires at 90 percent.

Paul Ryan one of few in GOP to vote 'to force Christian employers to hire' gay people, PAC says
","Even if by one measure he is the most conservative Speaker in decades, the idea of Paul Ryan leading the U.S. House of Representatives is an abomination to some on the right. That was evident on Oct. 14, 2015, more than two weeks before the Wisconsin Republican’s colleagues elected him speaker. A conservative political action committee issued a news release announcing its ""Fire Paul Ryan"" campaign.    The release from the Constitutional Rights PAC made a number of attacks on Ryan, including one about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. ""Paul Ryan would be the most liberal, pro-union, Republican speaker in history,"" said the release, quoting North Carolina Republican Kay Daly, who is running against a GOP incumbent for Congress. ""He is one of only six House Republicans who voted for Teddy Kennedy’s bill to force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees. Even John Boehner never did that!"" As we’ll see, there are problems with each part of the claim. Ryan’s vote The Constitutional Rights PAC, based outside of Washington, D.C., says it ""exists to advocate constitutional governance and remind elected servants of the oaths they swore to uphold."" The PAC takes credit for forcing Boehner, Ryan’s predecessor, to resign, and it ran a ""Fire Kevin McCarthy"" campaign before the California Republican unexpectedly dropped his bid to be speaker.   The PAC’s attack on Ryan is in reference to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, known as ENDA, which aims to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. It has been introduced a number of times, beginning in 1994, but has never become law. The late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was the main sponsor of the 1996 version of ENDA. The measure died after failing in the Senate on a 50-49 vote. So, there was no House vote on the Kennedy bill. Moreover, Ryan wasn’t elected to the House until 1998, two years later. A 2007 version of ENDA did pass the House, 235-184. There was never a vote in the Senate. According to a New Yorker article on the history of ENDA legislation, the measure died because it did not include protection for transgendered persons. Ryan voted yes on that measure. ""They didn’t roll out of bed one morning and choose to be gay. That’s who they are,"" he once said, acknowledging he ""took a lot of grief"" for the ENDA vote from fellow Republicans. The Constitutional Rights PAC, in its original news release, said Ryan was one of only six GOP House members who voted yes. That’s wrong. The release was later revised to say 10. But even that count is misleading, in that it only refers only to Republican House members who voted yes on the 2007 bill and are still in the House. As we noted, Ryan was among a total of 35 GOP House members who voted yes. Ten are still in the House, plus two others who voted yes are now in the Senate. The bill The thrust of the PAC’s claim is that the bill Ryan backed would have forced Christian employers to hire people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. That part of the claim is in error in that the bill did not include transgender people. And the ""force"" part of the claim, particularly as it applies to ""Christian employers,"" goes too far. The bill would have prohibited employers of 15 or more persons from discriminating in employment -- including hiring, firing and compensation -- on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation. At the same time, it would have prohibited the adoption of quotas or granting preferential treatment to an individual based on their sexual orientation. What’s more, the bill had a religious exemption. For example, it did not apply to a ""religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society which has as its primary purpose religious ritual or worship or the teaching or spreading of religious doctrine or belief."" The bill would not have applied, for example, to a religious school in the hiring of teachers who taught religious tenets, though it would have applied in the hiring of more general positions, such as janitor. There would not have been a general exemption, however, for employers who are Christian. For example, under the bill, a Christian owner of a dry cleaning business would have been in violation of the law to not hire a qualified job applicant simply because the person was gay. Madison attorney Tamara Packard, who has taught sexual orientation and the law as an adjunct professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, pointed out to us that there was no affirmative action element or quota in the legislation. (She also noted that, despite that federal ENDA legislation has never become law, discrimination in employment against people based on sexual orientation is illegal under Wisconsin law. The state law also includes a religious employer exemption.) So, it’s a stretch to say the ENDA bill Ryan voted for would ""force"" Christian employers -- or any employers, for that matter -- to hire lesbian, gay or bisexual people. Walter Olson, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us that some employers who would not have otherwise hired a gay person would have been forced to do so, if the person was qualified, or risk violating the law. But what the bill explicitly would have done is prohibit most employers from discriminating against gay, lesbian and bisexual people based on their sexual orientation -- which isn’t the same as requiring they be hired. Our rating The Constitutional Rights PAC said Ryan ""is one of only six House Republicans who voted for Teddy Kennedy's bill to force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees."" Ryan was among 35 House Republicans, including 10 still in the House (not six), who voted for a so-called ENDA bill that would have prohibited employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The ENDA bill Ryan voted for, in 2007, was not Kennedy’s bill from 1996. The 2007 bill would have protected lesbian, gay and bisexual people, but not transgender people. The bill, which exempted religious organizations in the hiring of certain employees, would not have forced employers to hire lesbian, gay and bisexual people but rather would have prohibited discriminating against them based on sexual orientation. We rate the statement False.   More on Paul Ryan Blogger Erick Erickson: ""Paul Ryan is one of less than a dozen Republican congressmen to have voted for every bailout to come before Congress."" Mostly False. Ryan: ""Every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has had"" fast-track trade authority. Half True. Ryan: All 28 members of NATO have ""pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense. But only three countries do -- Britain, Greece and us.""

"['Missouri', 'Peter Kinder']","

Lt. Gov. Kinder right about Nixon's veto overrides
","The Missouri General Assembly entered its yearly veto session on Sept. 16. In it, the Republican-led body voted to override 12 bills vetoed by Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat. Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, a GOP candidate for governor, said the amount of bills overridden in the Sept. 16 veto session represented a historic achievement for Nixon. ""After today, @GovJayNixon will have been overridden more times than all previous governors in #MO history #moleg,"" Kinder said in a tweet. We wondered if Kinder was right. Is Nixon Missouri's most overridden governor of all time? We reached out to Kinder's director of communications, Jay Eastlick, who sent us a list of Missouri governors and the number of times they were overridden. He gathered the information from Anne Rottmann, an administrator at the the Senate Legislative Library. Before the Constitution of 1875, Eastlick said, a simple majority was enough to override a veto. Veto sessions became annual events in 1989. During a veto session, the General Assembly may override any veto issued after the regular session if two-thirds of the members in each chamber agree. The list includes nine governors. It turns out Kinder is right. Not only is Nixon the most overridden governor in Missouri history, more of his vetoes have been overridden than those of all previous governors combined. (The chart below lists Missouri governors and the number of overrides of vetoed legislation. The chart does not include overrides of line item appropriations.)  Nixon vetoes have been overridden 34 times in the past six years: one each in 2011 and 2012; nine in 2013; 11 in 2014; and 12 this year. Between 2012 and 2013, there was a significant spike in vetoes. Legislative makeup under Nixon Of the 34 total overrides, 23 occurred after 2013. That's almost 68 percent of all overrides. Missouri's political climate and the makeup of the General Assembly, especially the House of Representatives, has undergone a noteworthy change during Nixon's current term. Here's a look at how the balance of power has changed:  Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon made history on Sept. 16 by having the most vetoes overridden for a Missouri governor. Missouri GOP members overrode a dozen of Nixon's vetoes. The Missouri legislature has experienced a small but steady increase of Republican seats in the House since 2009. Shy Hardiman The numbers show a small steady increase in Republican seats in the House. We wondered about the significance of this shift in power, so we reached out to a few experts to speak about the veto process and Missouri's political climate during Nixon's time as governor. Marvin Overby, an American politics professor at MU, said the partisan divide does have an impact on veto overrides. ""Any executive (governor or president) facing a legislature in which both chambers are controlled by the opposition will likely be in a position to a) use the veto pen more often and b) face a larger number of overrides."" Nixon faced a Republican-dominated General Assembly for nearly half his tenure as governor. Between 2009 and 2012, the Republicans in the House of Representatives did not hold a veto-proof majority because they didn't occupy two-thirds of the chamber. Every year since, Republicans have maintained a two-thirds margin in the General Assembly. The Senate has maintained a two-thirds margin since Nixon's first year in 2009. In addition to the legislative makeup, Peverill Squire, an American politics professor at MU, said the relationship between the governor and the legislature contributes to number of vetoes and veto overrides. ""The governor has not enjoyed a close relationship with the legislature and that has contributed to the number of bills he has vetoed and the number of those vetoes that have been overridden,"" Squire said. ""But partisanship rather than personal relationships really drives the number of overrides."" So, legislative makeup affects veto overrides and the bills that are vetoed in the first place, but is Kinder's claim significant? Overby said there are many ways to interpret the number of times Nixon has been overridden. ""From Kinder's perspective, the number is notable because it is the most in state history. But from another perspective, it would be reasonable to ask about the percentage of vetoes overridden,"" Overby said. So, we looked at the percentage of vetoes overridden.  Except for 2015, Nixon vetoes were sustained more often than they were overridden. Although 34 veto overrides is a historic number, Squire said it is worth noting that the GOP failed to override the governor on a number of key issues. Overby echoed Squire and said the more interesting question is how Nixon can sustain any vetoes given the makeup of the General Assembly. Overby said the reason vetoes were sustained depends on a multitude of factors: ""a) Nixon's skill in choosing which bills to veto, b) splits within the GOP caucuses in the chambers and c) the fact that vetoes and overrides are not always sincerely about policy … sometimes they are about politics."" Scott Holste, Nixon's press secretary, noted that Kinder's claims leaves out details. ""...the General Assembly has sustained several vetoes on the Governor's key priorities, including Right to Work in 2015, two school voucher bills, and numerous tax break giveaways that would have done serious damage to the state budget…"" Holste said. Holste also said lumping all the veto overrides together misses the point. ""The bills that have been vetoed have been vetoed for a number of different reasons,"" he said. ""In some instances, they are vetoed because of technical errors; others are vetoed because of constitutional problems; others because of unintended consequences."" Our ruling Kinder said Nixon has been overridden ""more times than all previous governors in Missouri history."" Thanks to the growing Republican majority in the legislature and the number of bills Nixon vetoed, that is indeed correct. We rate Kinder's claim to be True.

"['Campaign Finance', 'Wisconsin', 'Russ  Feingold']","
Russ Feingold changes his tune on campaign contributions
","More than 20 years ago, when he was first running for U.S. Senate, Democrat Russ Feingold painted a list of promises on the garage door of his Middleton home. Those 1992 vows -- he called it a contract with Wisconsin voters -- formed the basis of Feingold’s unusual ""everyman"" campaign. They were highlighted in memorable TV ads created by the late Steve Eichenbaum. Among the promises: Feingold said he would ""rely on Wisconsin citizens for most of my contributions."" That grassroots approach helped him win the Senate seat three times. But in 2010, Feingold was ousted by Republican businessman Ron Johnson, who spent millions of his own money on the race. In May 2015, Feingold announced that he would challenge Johnson in 2016. Six weeks later, Feingold filed his first campaign finance report with the Federal Election Commission. It showed he had already raised about $2.3 million. The National Journal reported Aug. 13, 2015 that it had examined Feingold’s individual contributions and determined  the majority of the money had come from out of state. Times change. And so do positions. Cue the Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether a politician has changed position on an issue. Remember: It does not measure whether any change is good or bad policy or politics, only whether the candidate has been consistent. The more-than-half-from-Wisconsin pledge is not a 1992 campaign relic. Feingold followed it in his re-election bids in 1998, 2004 and in 2010. This time around it was clear early on that Feingold planned to run a different kind of campaign. In an Aug. 13, 2015 interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Feingold noted that the campaign finance rules were different now than when he first ran for federal office. The McCain-Feingold campaign finance rules that he famously championed have been undone by the courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens’ United decision, which unleashed virtually unlimited campaign contributions to outside groups.   Feingold said he will not operate in this campaign by the pledge he made in past races. ""It makes no sense now,"" he said. Feingold argues the pledge was made on an election-to-election basis. ""Every single election is different based on the reality of the campaign finance law at the time,"" he said. ""What I did in the past is to offer a pledge or a series of proposals for a six-year term."" Maybe so, but that does not affect us here. We’re rating the consistency of a position, not whether a promise had been broken. Our rating In four Senate campaigns, Feingold abided by the pledge he inscribed on his garage door: He would raise the majority of his campaign cash from Wisconsin residents. Feingold said he was changing with the times, and is no longer bound by his previous pledge. That’s a complete reversal. And a Full Flop.","[('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Johnson hits Feingold for dropping past fund-raising pledge,"" Aug. 13, 2015', 'http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/johnson-hits-feingold-for-dropping-past-fundraising-pledge-b99556775z1-321819341.html'), ('National Journal, ""Feingold’s early fund raising breaks longtime campaign finance pledge,"" Aug. 13, 2015', 'No link'), ('Federal Elections Commission database', 'http://www.nationaljournal.com/s/70193/feingolds-early-fundraising-breaks-longtime-campaign-finance-pledge')]",/factchecks/2015/oct/28/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-changes-his-tune-campaign-contributi/
"['Georgia', 'Congress', 'States', 'Reader ']","
Unfit to serve? Congressman isn't even real
","Oh, our dear PolitiFact Georgia readers. Bless your hearts. That’s not a socially polite insult. We have sincere concerns after hearing from a reader, alarmed at the outlandish statements posted on Twitter by ""Rep. Steve Smith"" of Valdosta. ""Please check out hate-filled (timeline) of @RepStevenSmith,"" the reader asked us. ""How is a misogynist bigot of epic proportions allowed to serve? Dangerous."" Our worry is not with Smith’s timeline. True, it is littered with (cough) liberal use of ""boy"" to demean those who try to engage and plenty of media baiting, along with the promised ""partisan"" thoughts of someone claiming Tea Party membership. But our reader has, sadly, joined journalists Christiane Amanpour and Ezra Klein in becoming the latest victim of the parody Twitter account. Simply: ""Rep. Steven Smith"" is not real. The account, and the Congressman, are fakes. How do we know? We expect to hear protests from our bogus politico on Twitter, so let’s break down how you can trust us on this one. Step One: Read Twitter Smith’s Twitter bio is succinct and looks pretty official. It reads, ""Republican Representative of Georgia's 15th Congressional District. Tea Party Patriot. Constitutionalist. Partisan."" It’s also worth noting that Smith’s followers on the account include a chief of staff, @TJMitchJohnson. That adds to credibility, right? Step Two: Read some government stuff We’re paid to do the research for you, true. But it’s not hard to find an official list of Congressional representatives from the Peach State. Our friends at the government transparency website GovTrack have set up web pages showing the elected representation for every state. Georgia, it shows, is represented by two Senators (like all the other states) and 14 members of Congress. The Congressmen (Georgia has no female representatives) hail from districts made up of about 710,000 people each. For those keeping score, then, there is no 15th district in Georgia. There are only 14. Step Three: Find the real guy A Congressman does of course represent Valdosta. His name is Austin Scott, a Republican whose 8th Congressional District stretches from that south Georgia city, through Scott’s hometown of Tifton and into middle Georgia.  Scott was elected in 2010, riding on an anti-Democratic sentiment that swept national elections that year and flipped control of the House from D to R. While Scott is not a member of the Freedom Caucus that has pulled the GOP to the right in the past year, he is a clear conservative. He has co-sponsored a bill to repeal Obamacare, and he earned a True on the Truth-O-Meter for his claim that 97 percent of Americans aren’t receiving the premium subsidies under that law. Scott also has signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge from the Americans for Tax Reform, promising to oppose any effort to raise taxes and has been especially vocal in his opposition to any new federal gun laws. Scott’s main Twitter account (he also has a campaign account) focuses not only on some of those issues but also the more meat-and-potatoes work you’d expect, like Medicaid workshops in the district and a recent trip to a pecan farm. Step Four: Never forget Google Still not convinced? There is one other way to check your facts. As anyone who has ever watched ""Catfish"" knows, you can look up your Cyrano, or anyone, in Google image. When you drop the photo of the man claiming to be Steven Smith into the search engine, no name will appear. Instead, it takes you to the website of a big-and-tall men’s store in New Hampshire using that photo. But at least the store is called George’s. That’s almost like Georgia. In that same way, Rep. Steven Smith is almost a Congressman. The outrageous statements in question come from a parody account, not a real U.S. representative. How can someone like that serve? The U.S. Constitution says the only rules to serve are to be at least 25, a citizen for seven years and a resident of the state electing you. Of course, all those requirements mean you do have to be real. We rate this as Pants on Fire.","[('""Rep.

Feds own half of U.S. Western states, Jeb Bush says
","GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush has announced he wants a sea change in the federal government’s land management practices. In his Western Land Resource Management plan, which Bush released Oct. 21, 2015, the former Florida governor said federal land holdings are out of control — and therefore, so are expenses and Washington’s influence across the region. ""The federal government owns about half of the West, yet it continues to acquire more land,"" Bush said in the plan, which calls federal holdings ""a liability to economic freedom and growth."" He advocated more state and local control over these lands. Does Washington really own half of Western states, and is it looking for more? We decided to survey this for ourselves. The West vs. Washington There’s no exact total of how much land Washington owns and manages, partly because the total is constantly changing, but it’s a lot. According to the most recent data in a 2012 Congressional Research Service report, the government owns about 635 million to 640 million acres, or about 28 percent of all the land in the country. Most of that land is administered by three agencies in the Department of the Interior: the National Park Service (80 million acres); the Bureau of Land Management (248 million acres); and the Fish and Wildlife Service (89 million acres, plus another 217 million acres of marine refuges and monuments). In the U.S. Agriculture Department, the U.S. Forest Service is in charge of another 193 million acres. The Defense Department runs another 19 million acres in bases, training ranges and more. The rest is divided among several other departments and agencies. There is not an equal split among states, however. To Bush’s point, the federal government owns about 47 percent of the land in 11 Western states — Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. If we head east of the Mississippi River, Washington owns and manages only about 4 percent. This disparity is partly because of history. Most land in the West was at one time public, ranging from purchases from France, Mexico and Russia to land seized from Mexicans and Native Americans. The federal government has transferred land to private interests over the years and has focused on conservation during the last century, but these vast holdings have long been a contentious issue. Many Republicans in Western state legislatures would prefer to keep land-use decisions local. One group called the American Lands Council, headed by Utah Republican state Rep. Ken Ivory, is leading the charge in pushing for transferring federal land to states. The Council did not get back to us for this fact-check, but their website says the group wants federal lands transferred to states to ""provide better public access, better environmental health, and better economic productivity."" Bush’s plan calls for local control and a smaller federal footprint in general. Conservationists and researchers fear the real reason states want these transfers is to sell or lease public lands to private developers for ranching, mining or forestry. This land is our land As Bush says, the federal government is looking to make more acquisitions. His campaign pointed out the Interior and Agriculture departments made a fiscal year 2016 budget request that asked for almost $575 million for land acquisitions (plus $325 million for state conservation grants). The money was earmarked for acquisition projects across several federal agencies that ranged from national park lands to scenic trails to wildlife refuges. That doesn’t necessarily mean those agencies will get that money. The 2016 budget request is dependent on the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a pot of cash pooled from fees on offshore oil and gas leases. Authorized in 1965, the fund is the main mechanism for land purchases and broad conservation efforts. Congress is authorized to set aside as much as $900 million per year from this fund for land acquisition — note the 2016 request is for $900 million in all — but lawmakers rarely give conservation efforts that much. They usually shift the bulk of the money to other expenses and leave little for conservation efforts. Congress authorized $306 million total after a similar $900 million request in 2015. Complicating matters this year is that Congress failed to reauthorize the fund when it expired on Sept. 30. Bush said in his plan he supported a permanent reauthorization of the fund. ""There are additional funding sources for federal land acquisitions, but they are not as significant as LWCF,"" said Martin Nie, director of the Bolle Center for People & Forests at the University of Montana. ""And yes, federal agencies are often in the process of both acquiring more land and conveying (or exchanging) other federal lands."" Greg Zimmerman, policy director at the pro-conservation Center for Western Priorities, also pointed out that total federal acreage has fallen some over the years. That same CRS report concluded the five government agencies we mentioned earlier shed about 18 million acres between 1990 and 2010. Most of that change is from the Bureau of Land Management getting rid of land in Alaska, where the federal government still owns about 62 percent of the state. Our ruling Bush said, ""The federal government owns about half of the west, yet it continues to acquire more land."" He’s right that Washington owns about 47 percent of the land in the 11 most Western states.

Internet graphic asks why the focus on Benghazi when other attacks were never investigated at all
","One of the arguments made by critics of the House Select Committee on Benghazi is that the investigation is being treated differently than previous attacks. The creator of a Web graphic recently sought to draw a sharp contrast, suggesting that there was no investigation of key aspects of other deadly incidents, including the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing, the 9/11 attacks, the Iraq War and embassy attacks under George W. Bush. The post was created by a Facebook community called Point Counter Point and reached a wider audience through a re-posting by Occupy Democrats, a progressive advocacy group with a sizable presence in social media. Here’s part of what the group said in a graphic that circulated on the Internet around the time former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was testifying before the Benghazi select committee: • ""241 Marines die in Beirut. … Zero investigations."" • ""3,000 Americans died on 9-11. … No investigation why (President George W.) Bush ignored all CIA warnings."" • ""4,500 American soldiers die in Iraq. … No investigation why the war lasted 10 years at a cost of $6 trillion."" • ""66 Americans die at U.S. embassies (during the Bush administration). … Zero investigations."" A reader suggested we take a closer look, so we did. We found several problems with these claims, along with a nugget or two that checked out. Here's the graphic we're checking:  The Beirut bombing On Oct. 23, 1983, a truck filled with explosives breached the perimeter of a Marine barracks compound at Beirut International Airport in Lebanon. An explosion destroyed the building and killed 241 U.S. military personnel. The idea that this was never investigated is wrong. A panel led by Adm. Robert L.J. Long, who had recently finished serving as commander of U.S. military operations in the Pacific, produced a report looking at how the attack happened. The panel’s seven-week probe concluded that the Marines did not have the necessary intelligence to counter the attack, and also found problems with the actions of commanders in Lebanon and senior officers above them in Europe. The 9/11 attacks The graphic doesn’t deny that there were investigations of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but it claims that none investigated why Bush ""ignored all CIA warnings."" However, the highest-profile investigation -- commonly known as the 9/11 commission -- did indeed address the nature of advance intelligence about possible attacks and the response within government. The commission found that as 2001 began, counterterrorism officials received ""frequent but fragmentary reports about threats,"" but ""because the amount of reporting (was) so voluminous, only a select fraction (could) be chosen for briefing the president and senior officials."" The number of threat reports surged in June and July, the commission found, including a June 30 briefing to top officials headlined ""Bin Ladin Planning High-Profile Attacks"" and ""Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in U.S."" on Aug. 6, 2001. Efforts to disrupt various plots were undertaken in some 20 countries. The commission concluded that ""no one working on these late leads in the summer of 2001 connected the case in his or her in-box to the threat reports agitating senior officials and being briefed to the president. Thus, these individual cases did not become national priorities."" This conclusion may not have squared with that of some critics -- that Bush was given clear and specific warnings yet ignored them while vacationing at his ranch -- but it’s inaccurate to say that this topic wasn’t thoroughly investigated by the bipartisan commission. The Iraq War Several panels have looked at the Iraq War, including one chaired by former judge Laurence Silberman and former Sen. Chuck Robb; another chaired by former Secretary of State James A. Baker and former Rep. Lee Hamilton; and two directed by the Senate Intelligence Committee. In addition, multiple congressional hearings were held on the issue. The Silberman-Robb panel and the Senate panel were both highly critical of pre-war intelligence. Meanwhile, the Baker-Hamilton commission was not designed to be backward-looking; it was asked to analyze the state of post-war Iraq and suggest paths forward. ""The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating,"" the Baker-Hamilton commission said in its report. ""There is no path that can guarantee success, but the prospects can be improved."" Taken narrowly, the graphic has a point that no commission was created specifically to address the question of why ""the war lasted 10 years at a cost of $6 trillion."" But this glosses over the fact that several major commissions and congressional hearings were undertaken to address the many controversial aspects of the Iraq War, before, during and after the war itself. Embassy deaths under President George W. Bush This is where the graphic makes its most salient point. As PolitiFact has noted, there were at least 20 instances in which terrorists succeeded in killing at least one person in attacks on U.S. embassies, consulates or traveling diplomatic personnel between 2001 and 2009, when Bush was president. (Not all victims were Americans.) But unlike the Beirut bombing, 9/11 and the Iraq War, these attacks did not lead to the creation of a commission, either cumulatively or individually. For the first six years under Bush, the Republicans controlled Congress, while for the final two years, the Democrats did. Ted Bromund, a foreign policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, drew a contrast with how Congress and the executive branch responded to the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Even though these occurred under a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, and a Republican Congress -- a lineup equivalent to the one that produced the Benghazi investigations -- the process back then was much less fraught, even though it played out in the middle of the highly polarizing Monica Lewinsky scandal. The bombings ""were the subject of a substantial State Department investigation, a massive FBI one, and much congressional action around improving embassy security in the late 1990s and early to mid 2000s,"" Bromund said. ""But they were not the subject of much partisan interest because, first, the American people and the American system had not yet fully put two and two together to see these attacks as part of a rising al-Qaida threat, not merely one-off attacks; second, because the Clinton Administration did not seek to deny the obvious, that the Kenyan and Tanzanian attacks were indeed carried out by an organized terrorist group; and third, Clinton struck Sudan and Afghanistan with cruise missiles in 1998, two weeks after the bombing, in retaliation. While there is significant debate about whether the attack struck a relevant target in Sudan, it did draw widespread GOP support."" Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, also pointed to today’s fractious state of partisan politics as a key source of differences in how investigations were handled then as opposed to now. ""The problem with the Benghazi hearings is their blatant partisanship and redundancy,"" O’Hanlon said. Our ruling The graphic says there were no investigations of the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing, none on key aspects of the 9/11 attacks and the Iraq War, and none about embassy attacks under George W. Bush. The graphic has a point that deadly embassy attacks by terrorists during the Bush presidency did not prompt an investigation like the ones we’ve seen on the Benghazi attack. However, it’s flat wrong about the Beirut attack, and its assertion that key aspects of 9/11 and the Iraq War have not been investigated are largely incorrect. We rate the claim Mostly False.

Fact-checking Sean Hannity's claim on the U.S. accepting 250,000 refugees
","Editor’s note: After this fact-check originally published, Sean Hannity responded and provided the source of his claim. We have updated the fact-check to include his source and our analysis of it. The original version of this fact-check is archived here. The ruling remains Pants on Fire. The waves of refugees fleeing Syria and Iraq have given the conflict there a domestic immediacy in the race for the White House. While Europe is absorbing the great majority of refugees, some are headed toward the United States. The question is, how many? About 250,000, according to Fox News host Sean Hannity. During an interview with Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush on Oct. 19, 2015, Hannity worried that ISIS would try to infiltrate the arriving masses. ""You see the backlash emerging now in Europe over the refugee problem for Syria and Iraq,"" Hannity said. ""The president said he’s going to bring in 250,000 refugees into this country."" ""We can’t take 250,000 refugees,"" Bush responded. ""I’ve never heard that, and that would be impossible to imagine logistically for us to screen."" In plain fact, President Barack Obama never said that, nor as far as anyone can tell has any member of his administration. In September, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Obama ""informed his team that he would like them to accept -- at least make preparations to accept -- at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next fiscal year."" The 250,000 figure would dwarf the 120,000 refugees from the Syrian conflict the European community said it aims to relocate inside its members’ borders. What gives? A refugee crisis Hannity said his figure was based on a Sept. 20 Associated Press report. The AP report said that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the United States would accept up to 85,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2016 and up to 100,000 in Fiscal Year 2017. In Fiscal Year 2015, the United States accepted nearly 70,000 refugees. Add those three numbers together and you get 255,000 refugees, Hannity said. That math is right, but none of it makes Hannity's claim accurate. The Associated Press report Hannity cited is discussing the total number of refugees admitted to the United States worldwide. But Hannity, in his remarks Oct. 19 and Oct. 20, was discussing refugees coming from Iraq and Syria, fearing they might be infiltrated by ISIS or al-Qaida. Here, again, is what Hannity said Oct. 19: ""You see the backlash emerging now in Europe over the refugee problem for Syria and Iraq,"" Hannity said. ""The president said he’s going to bring in 250,000 refugees into this country."" And Oct. 20: ""You see what’s happening in Europe, there’s a huge backlash because of Syrian refugees and Iraqi refugees and the cost … We’re being told by our National Intelligence Director that ISIS and al-Qaida, not if, they will infiltrate the refugee community. This president has committed to nearly 250,000 coming to America."" In reality, the commitment Hannity talks about largely has been the standard practice of the United States going back decades. The United States has been accepting on average more than 83,000 refugees a year worldwide from 1980-2008, State Department records show. In Fiscal Year 2013 (the last year for which we have data), the State Department said it would admit up to 70,000 refugees. It ended up admitting 69,926, records show. Those refugee spots are not awarded on a first-come, first-serve basis. They are allocated specifically by region. Europe has an annual limit. So does Africa. So does Near East/South Asia, the area that includes Syria and Iraq. In Fiscal Year 2013, for example, the United States accepted 4,205 Cuban refugees and 16,000 from countries in East Asia. So what’s changing? For Fiscal Year 2016, the Obama administration has proposed raising the cap to 85,000 refugees -- an increase of 15,000 refugees over the previous year. In 2017, the cap would move to 100,000. Many, though not all, of those extra spaces would be used for Syrian refugees, the State Department says. ""We expect to admit some 1,600-1,800 Syrian refugees in FY 2015. In FY 2016, we project we will admit at least 10,000 Syrians,"" the State Department said in a report to Congress. The number of Iraqi refugees admitted to the United States has fluctuated over the years. In Fiscal Year 2013, the United States admitted 19,488 Iraqi refugees, up from 12,163 and 9,388 in Fiscal Years 2012 and 2011, respectively. Here is a breakdown of the State Department’s proposal by region for FY 2016: Refugee Admissions in FY 2014 and FY 2015 Proposed Refugee Admissions by Region for FY 2016 Region   FY 2014 Actual arrivals FY 2015 Ceiling   Revised FY 2015 Ceiling   FY 2015 projected arrivals   Proposed FY2016 Ceiling Africa 17,476 17,000 20,400 22,600 25,000 East Asia 14,784 13,000 17,300 18,200 13,000 Europe and Central Asia 959 1,000 2,300 2,350 4,000 Latin America/Caribbean 4,318 4,000 2,300 2,050 3,000 Near East/South Asia 32,450 33,000 27,700 24,800 34,000 Regional Subtotal 69,987 68,000 70,000 70,000 79,000 Unallocated Reserve   2,000     6,000 Total 69,987 70,000 70,000 70,000 85,000

But that’s all lost on the viewing audience, who gets no idea of the time frame and would reasonably think he’s talking about only refugees from Syria and Iraq. From 1980-2008, the United States has accepted around 83,000 refugees a year. The Obama administration has said it will accept around 70,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2015 and is saying it will accept 85,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2016 and 100,000 in Fiscal Year 2017. Over those three years, that’s about 6,000 refugees more than the recent annual average. Overall, Obama is asking the country to take in an additional 45,000 refugees in 2016 and 2017. Most, but not all, of those additional refugees will come from Syria.

Jeb Bush says top 1 percent pay nearly half of all taxes
","A high school student at a New Hampshire town hall quizzed Jeb Bush on how he will close tax loopholes for the rich. Bush said that although tax brackets are progressive -- meaning the more you earn, the more you pay -- they end up being regressive because rich people invest in the stock market and then have less taxable income. ""On taxes, we do have a progressive tax rate when you consider that the top 1 percent pay 45 percent of all taxes in the country,"" Bush said during the Oct. 14 town hall in Concord. ""That is a fairly disproportionate amount."" Bush then summarized his tax proposal, which includes a tax break for the rich as well as the middle class and cuts the corporate tax rate. Also under Bush’s plan, a family of four that earns $40,000 or less would pay no federal income taxes. We wanted to look at Bush’s comment about how much the wealthy pays in taxes. Does the top 1 percent pay nearly half the taxes in the country? Income taxes vs. all federal taxes We found that the accuracy of Bush’s comment depends on what type of federal taxes we consider. (Our analysis won’t cover state and local taxes, which vary across the country.) The Tax Policy Center, home to widely quoted nonpartisan experts on taxes, calculated in June that the top 1 percent will have 16.5 percent of total income in 2015 and pay 43.6 percent of federal income taxes. So Bush would have been very close to correct if he had specified income taxes, but instead he said ""all taxes."" If we consider all federal taxes, the proportion paid by the top 1 percent is less than what was cited by Bush: 27.9 percent. That calculation by the Tax Policy Center includes a slew of federal taxes that includes income, payroll, corporate, estate and excise taxes. ""It’s the difference between all taxes and federal income taxes,"" said Mike Tanner, a tax expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""He didn’t say federal income tax, but if he is talking about federal income tax he is right."" It’s important to note that while both calculations show an overall progressive federal tax system -- meaning the more you earn, the more you pay -- certain types of taxes are regressive, including payroll and excise taxes. The top 1 percent pay just 5.5 percent of payroll taxes even though they earn about 16.5 percent of total income. In contrast, the middle quintile has 13.8 percent of total income but pay 15.8 percent of payroll taxes. We found another calculation that shows slightly lower numbers than the Tax Policy Center for how much the wealthy pay in taxes. The Congressional Budget Office found that for 2011, the top 1 percent received 14.6 percent of before-tax income and paid 24 percent of all federal taxes and 35.4 percent of all individual income taxes. (The November 2014 report is the office’s most recent one, but it looks at numbers that are a few years older than the Tax Policy Center report.) We sent a spokesman for Bush’s campaign a summary of our findings. Matt Gorman said that Bush was responding to questions about the progressivity about federal income tax brackets. The student did talk about ""tax brackets"" and closing ""tax holes for rich people,"" but he didn’t directly ask a question about ""federal income tax rates."" (Here is PolitiFact’s transcript of their exchange.) Our ruling Bush said, ""the top 1 percent pay 45 percent of all taxes in the country."" Bush was answering a question about taxable income, the progressivity of our tax system and closing loopholes for the rich. So part of the question he faced related to income taxes. And part of his answer related to income taxes, because he talked about his own plan for income tax cuts. But Bush could have been more specific in his reply. The 45 percent number applies to federal income taxes, not all taxes. Bush spoke generically about ""all taxes,"" so if we look at all federal taxes, the share for the top 1 percent was 27.9 percent.

In his book, A More Perfect Union, Carson wrote that ""German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s, and by the mid-1940s Hitler's regime had mercilessly slaughtered six million Jews and numerous others whom they considered inferior. ""Through a combination of removing guns and disseminating deceitful propaganda, the Nazis were able to carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance,"" he wrote. Carson reiterated that argument at least twice -- in an Oct. 8, 2015, interview with CNN host Wolf Blitzer, and then again in a speech at the National Press Club. ""You know, mid- to late-30s, they started a program to disarm the people and by mid- to late 40's, look what had happened,"" he said at the Press Club. PolitiFact decided to analyze Carson’s claim on its Truth-O-Meter. German gun laws As the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany, it inherited a 1928 gun registration law that had replaced a total ban on gun ownership imposed on a defeated Germany after World War I. The 1928 law created a permit system to own and sell firearms and ammunition. ""But this order was followed quite rarely, so that largely, only newly bought weapons became registered,"" said Dagmar Ellerbrock, an expert on German gun policies at the Dresden Technical University. ""At that time, most men, and many women, still owned the weapons they acquired before or during the first World War."" When they came to power, the Nazis used whatever gun records they had to seize weapons from their enemies, but Ellerbock told us the files included very few of the firearms in circulation. ""In my records, I found many Jews who well into the late 1930s possessed guns,"" Ellerbock told us. The Nazis adopted a new gun law in 1938. According to an analysis by Bernard Harcourt, a professor at Columbia University School of Law, it loosened gun ownership rules in several ways. It deregulated the buying and selling of rifles, shotguns and ammunition. It made handguns easier to own by allowing anyone with a hunting license to buy, sell or carry one at any time. (You didn’t need to be hunting.) It also extended the permit period from one year to three and gave local officials more discretion in letting people under 18 get a gun. The regulations to implement this law, rather than the law itself, did impose new limits on one group: Jews. On Nov. 11, 1938, the German minister of the interior issued ""Regulations Against Jews Possession of Weapons."" Not only were Jews forbidden to own guns and ammunition, they couldn’t own ""truncheons or stabbing weapons."" In addition to the restrictions, Ellerbrock said the Nazis had already been raiding Jewish homes and seizing weapons. ""The gun policy of the Nazis can hardly be compared to the democratic procedures of gun regulations by law,"" Ellerbrock told us. ""It was a kind of special administrative practice (Sonderrecht), which treated people in different ways according to their political opinion or according to ‘racial identity’ in Nazi terms."" The power of a police state In short, Nazi-era Germany imposed greater gun restrictions for Jews (and other perceived enemies) at the same time it loosened gun restrictions for other groups. But that’s not what Carson said. He made a more sweeping claim about Nazis disarming German citizens. Carson then goes on to say that the lack of guns allowed the Nazis to ""carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance."" But a key turning point in the Nazi path to power illustrates that the availability of guns was not a pivotal issue. Paramilitary organizations were part of the Nazi operation from its earliest days in the mid 1920s. The Sturmabteilung, or Brownshirts, was a founding Nazi street fighting organization. Another outfit, the Schutzstaffel, or SS, provided protection to Nazi officials as they moved about the country. After Hitler won office, the SS under Heinrich Himmler became part of Hitler's inner circle, and Himmler felt the Sturmabteilung was too difficult to control. He and his collaborators concocted a rumor that the Sturmabteilung was plotting a coup. In 1934, in a span of three days, Himmler’s SS units killed between 85 and 200 Sturmabteilung leaders and other perceived enemies. Hitler himself oversaw the arrest of one of his oldest comrades, Ernst Roehm, the head of the Sturmabteilung. In the middle of that arrest, a truckload of armed Sturmabteilung troops rolled up, but not a shot was fired. Roehm was executed days later. The staff at the German Historical Institute wrote that with this operation, Hitler had managed to ""legitimize outright murder on a large scale – without any legal proceedings whatsoever – and that the country largely accepted the Nazi propaganda that presented this strike as necessary."" Our ruling Carson said that under the Nazis, ""German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s,"" which allowed the Nazis to ""carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance."" This is a misreading of history on two levels. First, German citizens as a whole were not disarmed by the Nazis. Jews and other supposed enemies of the state were subject to having their weapons seized. But for most German citizens, the Nazi period was one in which gun regulations were loosened, not tightened.  Second, a lack of guns was not the issue. If the majority of Germans had wanted to use these guns to fight the Nazis, they could have. But they didn’t. Carson ignores that the Nazis enjoyed significant popular support, or at least, broad acquiescence. We rate this claim False.  ","[('Ben Carson, A More Perfect Union, Oct, 2015', 'https://www.amazon.com/More-Perfect-Union-Constitutional-Liberties/dp/1591848040'), ('C-SPAN, National Press Club - Ben Carson, Oct. 9, 2015', 'No link'), ('CNN, Ben Carson explains Holocaust comments, Oct. 9, 2015', 'http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4555705/carson-npc'), ('Fordham Law Review, On gun registration, the NRA, Adolf Hitler and Nazi gun laws, June 2004', 'No link'), ('German Federal Statistical Office, Gebiet und bevolkerung, 1871-1971', 'https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/08/politics/ben-carson-gun-control-2016-election/'), ('Yizkor Book Project, German security services, undated', 'No link'), ('Gordon Williamson, World War II German Police Units, 2006', 'http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4029&context=flr'), ('German Historical Institute, Nazi Germany 1933-1945, undated', 'No link'), ('German History in Documents and Images, Erich Kempka’s Eyewitness Description of ""Operation Hummingbird"" on June 30, 1934, 1954', 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwiJbAWhwPe_T24yN05OX045WUlPVkNMNUFWRlNBcjg3UWxB/view?usp=sharing'), ('U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, German police in the Nazi state, undated', 'No link'), ('Martin Collier and Philip Pedley, Hitler and the Nazi State, 2005', 'http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/belzec1/bel010.html'), ('National Review, The Weimar Republic’s well-intentioned gun registry became a tool for evil, Dec. 2, 2013', 'No link'), ('Salon, The Hitler gun control lie, Jan. 11, 2013', 'https://books.google.com/books?id=uCynpSZVskgC&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=function+of+Schutzpolizei+der+Laender+1935&source=bl&ots=fL2TjbUPSn&sig=TK5Cc3CUVT4gA4XIYVfb-7kYIXc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCUQ6AEwATgKahUKEwjLsfCu887IAhWCnYAKHYGQBd0#v=onepage&q=function%20of%20Schutzpolizei%20der%20Laender%201935&f=false'), ('Huffington Post, Ben Carson Blames Holocaust On Gun Control, Oct. 8, 2015', 'No link'), ('New York Times, Ben Carson Is Wrong on Guns and the Holocaust, Oct. 14, 2015', 'http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/Volume%207%20Introduction%20English.pdf'), ('German Federal Archives, Arrest of Communists, March 6, 1933', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Dagmar Ellerbrock, professor of history, Technical University of Dresden, Oct. 17, 2015', 'http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/English9_Exeter.pdf'), ('Email interview, Klaus Weinhauer, professor of history, University of Bielefeld, Oct. 18, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Bernard Harcourt, professor of law, Columbia University School of Law, Oct. 16, 2015', 'http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005464'), ('Email interview, Dietrich Oberwittler, professor of sociology, University of Freiburg, Oct. 16, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/oct/26/ben-carson/fact-checking-ben-carson-nazi-guns/

Trump says 61 percent of U.S. bridges 'in trouble'
","Donald Trump wants to build bridges, although not necessarily the political kind. ""We’re like a Third World country,"" he said during a Oct. 14 rally in Henrico County. ""Our airports, our roads, our bridges are falling down. Sixty-one percent of our bridges are in trouble. Do you believe this? We drive over a bridge, it’s in trouble."" We wondered whether the eye-popping 61 percent figure is true. Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to our request for the source of the statistic, so we did some digging. The Federal Highway Administration publishes annual data on deficient bridges in state and federal highway systems. The most recent report, based on December 2014 findings, found that 61,365 bridges are ""structurally deficient."" That breaks down to about 10 percent of the nation’s 610,749 bridges. The FHWA website says ""a `structurally deficient’ designation does not imply that a bridge is unsafe, but such bridges typically require significant maintenance and repair to remain in service, and would eventually require major rehabilitation or replacement to address the underlying deficiency."" These often are rural bridges, according to the agency. The FHWA lists another 84,525 bridges -- or almost 14 percent -- as ""functionally obsolete."" These are mostly urban spans that the agency says don’t ""meet current design standards (for criteria such as lane width), either because the volume of traffic carried by the bridge exceeds the level anticipated when the bridge was constructed and/or the relevant design standards have been revised."" All told, 145,890 U.S. bridges have been identified as deficient. That comes to 24 percent of the nation’s spans. We should note that the Henrico rally wasn’t the first time Trump has used the bridge statistic. During an Aug. 25 news conference in Iowa, he said ""59 percent of our bridges are in trouble."" FactCheck.org published an article two days later saying the claim was inaccurate. Finally, if you’re wondering, Virginia has 13,800 bridges and the highway administration characterizes 3,574 of them as deficient. That’s 26 percent. Of those spans, 1,120 -- or 8 percent -- are structurally deficient. Another 2,454 bridges -- or 18 percent -- are functionally obsolete. Our ruling Trump says ""61 percent of our bridges are in trouble."" The FHWA identifies 24 percent of the bridges as deficient. This doesn’t mean, to borrow a Trump phrase, that ""our bridges are falling down."" It means that the infrastructure is aging and many of the spans require high maintenance, while others are serving more traffic than anticipated when they were built. We don’t mean to minimize the nation’s infrastructure problems, but Trump’s inflated figure is nowhere near the mark. We rate his statement False.","[('C-SPAN, Donald Trump speech in Henrico County, Va., Oct. 14, 2015.

Norment says only 2 percent of Virginia guns sales exempt from background checks
","Efforts to widen Virginia’s background checks on people seeking to buy firearms underwhelm state Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City. ""We have a pretty comprehensive background check right now,"" Norment said during a recent debate with Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax. ""Right now, statistics in the commonwealth of Virginia show that only about 2 percent of the guns that are being bought or sold are outside of that universal background check,"" Norment added. Gov. Terry McAuliffe wants a reluctant General Assembly to expand Virginia’s background check to all prospective gun buyers. His call came in the wake of the Aug. 26 fatal shootings near Smith Mountain Lake of WDBJ-TV reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward. The law now requires all licensed gun dealers - those in the business of selling arms - to conduct a computerized check to determine whether a buyer has a disqualifying criminal record or mental health history. But casual sales and transfers between individuals are exempt. We wondered whether Norment was right in saying only 2 percent of Virginia sales fall into that exempt category. Jeff Ryer, a spokesman for the Virginia Senate Republican Caucus, told us Norment erred. ""As best we can determine, there are no state-by-state statistics available for the source of a firearm used in a crime,"" Ryer wrote in an email. Ryer is correct. Neither the Virginia State Police nor the Virginia Firearms Transaction Center ""has any way of tracking the volume of private sales in Virginia,"" said Corinne Geller, communications manager for the state police. We also should note that there are no conclusive national statistics about the percentage of guns that are sold without a background check. Many gun control advocates - including McAuliffe and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. - have said it’s ""estimated"" that 40 percent of U.S. gun sales occur without background checks. But this claim is based on a small-sample survey of purchasers that’s almost 21 years old and counts some guns that were brought before a national background check law took effect. As we’ve reported, even the researchers of that study say they ""don’t know"" if their findings are relevant today. There’s been no updated national study. A final note: The killer of Parker and Ward bought his gun legally and passed a background check, according to law-enforcement officials. Our ruling Norment said ""only about 2 percent"" of gun sales in Virginia are not subject to background checks. A spokesman says Norment erred, and we agree. No one knows how many guns are sold privately in Virginia or nationwide these days. Statistics aren’t available. We rate Norment’s statement False.","[('Tommy Norment, Debate to with Dick Salslaw, Oct. 5, 2015.', 'https://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/apr/28/tim-kaine/kaine-says-40-percent-guns-sales-estimated-escape-/'), ('Email and interview with Jeff Ryer, spokesman for the Virginia Senate Republican Caucus, Oct. 12-13, 2015.', 'No link'), ('Email from Corinne Geller,', 'https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=13032'), ('U.S. Department of Justice, ""Firearm Violence, 1993-2011,"" published May 2013.', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/oct/26/thomas-norment-jr/norment-says-only-2-percent-virginia-guns-sales-do/

Georgia briefly tops chart for flu reports
","The flu season is upon us. But is it hitting the Peach State harder than other places? We wondered after seeing a map on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website Thursday, showing Georgia with the highest flu activity in the country, and hearing television reports repeating the claim. The short answer: Not really. Flu season starts in October and can run into May. It typically peaks in Georgia by early January, with upticks after Thanksgiving and Christmas when germs are often passed like holiday feasts. Flu vaccines are designed to protect against the main flu viruses that research suggests will be the most common of the season. This year’s vaccines protect against three viruses. The CDC develops its ""flu view"" map based on weekly reports from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico of outpatient visits to doctors for treatment of flu-like symptoms. The information is voluntarily submitted by doctors’ offices to their state public health departments. States on the CDC map are assigned to one of four levels of influenza-like illness activity -- minimal, low, moderate, or high. Georgia was identified as having ""low"" flu activity in the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10, the most recent period for which outpatient information was available on Thursday. But that was a notch above the rest of the nation, which this early in flu season fell in the minimal range. ""The biggest takeaway is the flu is here,"" said Nancy Nydam, spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Public Health, ""and if you don’t have a flu shot, you need to get one."" Georgia did not report any hospitalizations or deaths due to the flu in that week, Nydam said. South Carolina, meanwhile, had four flu deaths but showed up with less flu activity on the CDC map because the map -- again --  is based on how many people see a doctor, not how many die. ""It’s really misleading,"" Nydam said. ""The numbers (of patients with flu-like symptoms) are so low."" Georgia reported 22,273 patients visiting doctor’ offices in the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10, with 379 of those patients or 1.7 percent exhibiting flu-like symptoms. Compare that to a report from a week in December 2014, when 20,835 people visited doctors, 1,643 or 7.89 percent with flu-like symptoms. Changes come quickly If Georgia was identified as the state with the highest flu activity on Thursday, it was a different story Friday. That’s because on Friday the Georgia Department of Public Health had later, data from the week starting Oct. 11. It showed Georgia’s flu activity down in the minimal range, where the rest of the country had been the week before. (Of 25,876 patients, 355 or 1.37 percent had flu-like symptoms. South Carolina and Alaska jumped ahead of Georgia in activity, but they were just higher in the minimal range, Nydam said. The CDC doesn’t look at the flu activity in isolation, said Lynnette Brammer, CDC epidemiologist. The map is just one of nine resources that the CDC uses to track increases in flu-like illnesses across the country, she said. ""You take a look at all those pieces, including laboratory data, and you can get a pretty complete picture of flu that comes in contact with health care systems,"" Brammer said. ""With flu, you should never look at just one piece."" Doctors report cases where patients complain of flu-like symptoms -- fever, cough or sore throat, she said. ""That flu-like illness may have been flu or may not have been,"" Brammer said. Our ruling Georgia had the highest flu activity in the country based on data provided by doctors offices across the country and mapped by the CDC for the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10. That information factors into the CDC’s efforts to track what goes on through flu season. But it’s based on data submitted voluntarily and that, as we have seen, can change week -to-week. That’s important context that downgrades the statement to Mostly True.","[('Center for Disease Control and Prevention ""flu view"" map for week 40 ending Oct. 10, 2015 and for week 41 ending Oct. 17, 2015', 'http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/main.html'), ('""Georgia has highest flu activity in country"" WSB-TV, Oct, 21, 2015', 'No link'), ('""Georgia Has Most Cases of Flu in the Country, Still Ranks ‘Low’ Range,"" WRBL , Oct. 21, 2015', 'http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/georgia-has-highest-flu-activity-country/nn6yW/'), ('""Georgia sees early flu activity,"" WXIA-TV, Oct. 21, 2015', 'No link'), ('Interview with Nancy Nydam, media relations manager, Georgia Department of Public Health', 'http://wrbl.com/2015/10/21/georgia-has-most-cases-of-flu-in-the-country-still-ranks-low-range/'), ('Interview with Lynnette Brammer, epidemiologist, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)', 'No link'), ('Profile, Lynnette Brammer, CDC, The Washington Post', 'http://www.11alive.com/story/news/health/2015/10/21/georgia-sees-early-flu-activity/74352578/'), ('About the 2015-2016 flu season, the CDC -- what you should know', 'No link'), ('\xa0', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/federal-faces-lynnette-brammer/2013/03/11/7d109f12-8a89-11e2-98d9-')]",/factchecks/2015/oct/26/centers-disease-control/georgia-briefly-tops-chart-flu-reports/

Liberal pundit: Marco Rubio opposes rape, incest abortion exception
","The struggles of Jeb Bush have pundits rethinking who will emerge as the Republican establishment alternative to 2016 outsiders like Ben Carson and Donald Trump. A name that keeps surfacing: Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio is the ""candidate who seems to be in the cat-bird’s seat right now,"" said ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. Stephanopoulos asked liberal pundit and former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm if Rubio has Democrats worried. Not really, Granholm said. ""He’s one of the most extreme,"" she said. ""For example, he doesn’t agree with a woman’s right to choose even in the case of rape or incest,"" Granholm said. We previously looked into some of Rubio’s statements and votes regarding abortion. Does he oppose abortion in the case of rape or incest? Rubio’s debate comments Rubio discussed his position on abortion during the first Republican presidential debate, Aug. 6, 2015, in Cleveland. We’ll show you the exchange between Rubio and moderator Megyn Kelly. Kelly: ""You favor a rape and incest exception to abortion bans. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York just said yesterday those exceptions are preposterous. He said they discriminate against an entire class of human beings. If you believe that life begins at conception, as you say you do, how do you justify ending a life just because it begins violently, through no fault of the baby?"" Rubio: ""Well, Megyn, first of all, I'm not sure that that's a correct assessment of my record. I would go on to add that I believe all --"" Kelly: ""You don't favor a rape and incest exception?"" Rubio: ""I have never said that. And I have never advocated that. What I have advocated is that we pass a law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection. In fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States."" The exchange is noteworthy for two reasons. First, Rubio bristles at the suggestion that he favors abortion exceptions for rape and incest. But, he also never definitively answers Kelly’s question about his position. NBC’s Chuck Todd tried to get clarity a few days later on Meet the Press. The takeaway: Rubio supports legislation that makes abortion more rare whether or not exceptions for rape and incest are included. So that means he’ll support legislation that reduces abortion even if it includes exceptions. But that also means he doesn’t necessarily believe that an exception should be included in every piece of abortion legislation. ""I'll support any legislation that reduces the number of abortions, so that means a 20-week abortion ban. At five months, a child -- you'll recognize it as a human being in an ultrasound image. And I'll support that. That doesn't obviously cover the whole gamut, but it reduces the number of abortions,"" Rubio said. ""I'll support any legislation that reduces the number of abortions and there are those that have that exception in it. What I've never done is said I require that it must have or not have exceptions."" Granholm’s office pointed us toward several news accounts highlighting Rubio’s position and the exchange between Kelly and Rubio. The articles largely reach the same conclusion: Rubio will support anti-abortion legislation that includes an exception for rape and incest, but he prefers that the procedure be illegal even in cases of rape and incest. ""I personally believe you do not correct one tragedy with a second tragedy. That's how I personally feel very strongly about,"" Rubio said Aug. 7, 2015, on CNN. ""I believe all human life irrespective of the circumstances in which it came into being is worthy of the protection of our laws. I recognize this is a tough question. It's a very difficult question. And I understand that. Believe me, I do. But by the same token if I have to weigh the two equities here, I'm always going to err on the side of life."" Rubio’s record on abortion Rubio, for the record, has supported legislation in the Senate that includes exceptions for rape and incest. In November 2013, Rubio was one of 40 co-sponsors of a Senate bill entitled ""Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act."" Several GOP presidential candidates backed the bill, including main sponsor Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and co-sponsors Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky. The bill bans abortions at 20 weeks or greater but includes exceptions, including rape and incest. Graham sponsored a similar version in 2015 -- and again Rubio is listed as one of dozens of co-sponsors. The 2015 version also has a rape exception, although the language differs. It requires adult women to obtain counseling or medical treatment for the rape 48 hours before the abortion, with separate criteria for minors about reporting the rape to law enforcement. Rubio has long been an opponent of abortion rights, and his record bears that out. National Right to Life gave him a 100 percent rating for the 112th and 113th congresses. In both sessions, the ratings were based on five votes, such as cutting off funding for Planned Parenthood, repealing or defunding the Affordable Care Act and protecting free speech. The Family Research Council also gave Rubio a 100 percent rating for 13 votes in 2013-14. And NARAL, a group that supports abortion rights, gave Rubio a zero every year between 2011 and 2014. ""I personally and deeply believe that all human life is worthy of the protection of our laws, I do,"" Rubio said in his Meet the Press interview. ""And I believe that irrespective of the conditions by which that life was conceived or anything else, and for me to be consistent on that belief, that's why I feel so strongly about it. ""That being said, I recognize that in order to have a consensus on laws that limit the number of abortions, a lot of people want to see those exceptions and that's why I've supported those laws in the past, as has every pro-life group in America."" Our ruling Granholm said Rubio opposes abortion ""even in the case of rape and incest."" The record suggests Rubio has staked out a slightly more nuanced position. Rubio is staunchly anti-abortion and has suggested he personally opposes abortion in cases of rape and incest, but he has supported abortion legislation that include those exceptions. Rubio says he supports legislation that makes abortion more rare. Granholm’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.","[('ABC This Week, Oct. 25, 2015', 'http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-rubio-abortion-20150807-story.html'), ('Meet the Press, interview with Marco Rubio, Aug. 9, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Rubio spokesman Alex Conant, Oct. 25, 2015', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-08-10/democrats-see-opportunity-in-rubio-s-no-to-abortion-even-after-rape-or-incest'), ('Email interview Granholm spokeswoman Carole Love, Oct. 25, 2015', 'No link'), ('Los Angeles Times, Marco Rubio takes tough stand against abortion, with no exceptions for rape or incest, Aug. 7, 2015', 'https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/7/marco-rubio-touts-abortion-opposition-including-ca/'), (""Bloomberg, Democrats See Opportunity in Marco Rubio's No to Abortion Even After Rape or Incest, Aug. 10. 2015"", 'No link'), ('Washington Times, Marco Rubio touts abortion opposition, including in cases of rape and incest, Aug. 7, 2015', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnnX3-ePOJk'), ('CNN, Interview with Sen.
