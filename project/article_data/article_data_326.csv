Yes, conservatives did share false post about Pritzker’s daughter
","While explaining why his family would not be together celebrating Thanksgiving this year, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker blasted online accusations that his daughter broke COVID-19 protocols at a restaurant gathering. ""A parody Twitter account posted a picture of a group of individuals eating outside a Chicago restaurant, supposedly breaking the COVID rules the city put in place,"" Pritzker said at a Nov. 17 press conference. ""And the person posting the photo claimed one of the people in it was my daughter."" ""My office put out a statement making clear this wasn’t my daughter,"" Pritzker said. ""But that didn’t stop Republican elected officials, a network of propaganda publications in the state and some radio shock jocks from telling people that the picture was of my daughter, despite knowing that this was a lie."" Pritzker said his teenage daughter, Teddi, was in Florida with his wife, and would ""remain there indefinitely"" because she had started receiving ""hateful and threatening messages."" Teddi is not identifiable among the group of 14 diners in the published photo. So we decided to find out where the misinformation came from and who had shared it. What we learned shows the governor was correct about how the rumors spread. The photo was originally shared on Twitter by an account called @deuxmoiworld, according to a thread written by Pritzker’s chief of staff, Anne Caprara. That account links to a website that describes it as a purveyor of ""rumors and conjecture."" By the time we checked it, the image was deleted and the account’s operator had apologized for sharing it. But the image was already being spread on other Twitter accounts, Caprara documented in her thread, including one that described itself as ""a parody account."" Then a website with connections to conservative political operatives called Chicago City Wire picked it up, publishing a post based solely on the parody account’s tweet. That account’s tweets are now private. The story does not say which person in the photo is purportedly Pritzker’s daughter nor what date the photo was taken, though servers in the background are wearing masks. Chicago City Wire is produced by Local Government Information Services, a company run by conservative radio talk show host Dan Proft, state records show. In October, Proft was featured in a New York Times investigation into a nationwide string of local sites that purport to be news sites, but are instead vehicles for stories ordered up by GOP groups and corporate PR firms. In 2015, Proft teamed up with another controversial internet entrepreneur, Brian Timpone, to start a chain of such publications in Illinois. Proft and Timpone did not respond to requests for comment. Following complaints to the Illinois Board of Elections about political funding behind the Illinois sites, the Times reported, a disclaimer on their ""About"" pages now says they are funded, ""in part, by advocacy groups who share our beliefs in limited government."" That disclaimer now appears on Chicago City Wire. We confirmed with Pritzker’s office these were the websites he was referring to as ""propaganda publications."" Propaganda includes ""ideas, facts, or allegations spread deliberately to further one's cause or to damage an opposing cause,"" according to Merriam-Webster. While there’s room for disagreement about the perimeters of the term, Pritzker’s use of it to describe these sites is reasonable in light of the New York Times’ findings. Pritzker’s spokeswoman also pointed to Proft’s radio show, Chicago’s Morning Answer to explain his reference to ""radio shock jocks"" sharing the story. On the Nov. 13 episode of the show, a listener called in to ask co-host Amy Jacobson and a guest host if they would confront the governor about City Wire’s story. Jacobson dismissed that suggestion, but still gave credence to the claim that Teddi was pictured, saying, ""I’m glad that she’s out socializing outside, I’m glad that she’s living and not existing."" When reached by phone, Jacobson declined to comment for this fact-check. Several state Republican lawmakers also chose to share the post, backing up the most serious portion of Pritzker’s claim. ""Like I’ve been saying from the beginning, this is how you handle a lockdown!"" Rep. Darren Bailey of Xenia wrote in a Facebook post sharing the City Wire story. Bailey’s post has since been shared by more than 700 of his followers. Rep. Grant Wehrli of Naperville also retweeted a post from a Twitter user who shared the story. That user has since apologized for spreading false information and deleted her original tweet. Neither Bailey nor Wehrli responded to email inquiries or calls to their district offices asking why they believed the post was credible. Pritzker said ""Republican elected officials, a network of propaganda publications in the state and some radio shock jocks"" were spreading ""a lie"" about his daughter dining outside at a restaurant with a large group of people during the COVID-19 pandemic. The false claim Pritzker is referring to is based on a photograph of 14 individuals gathered around a table, none of which are identifiable as his daughter. It was spread by gossip and parody accounts on Twitter before being picked up by a website operated by a company that accepts money from partisan groups and is run by a conservative talk show radio host whose co-host later repeated the claim on-air. While definitions of ""propaganda"" may vary, Pritzker’s use of the term here is reasonable given the context. Two GOP state lawmakers also shared the post on social media. We rate Pritzker’s claim True. TRUE — The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

No evidence Patton said this about liberal Democrats
","Amid some conservative outrage over the results of the presidential election, an old social media post is gaining traction. A photo shows Gen. George Patton standing in uniform, and overlaid is this quote attributed to the military leader: ""Politicians are the lowest form of life on earth. Liberal Democrats are the lower form of politicians."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Snopes, which previously looked into this attribution, found that it appeared in the 1983 book ""The Unknown Patton"" by Charles Province. But the quote doesn’t have a citation in the book, which advises in its introduction that ""while not all source material was taken literally into quotations or even utilized as pure textual content, they were used rather as background data to supply a feeling or understanding of a situation prior to writing about it.""  ""Politicians are the lowest form of life"" appeared unattributed to Patton in a 1948 book by Stuart Chase called ""The Proper Study of Mankind."" And in 1945, Harry Truman wrote in his diary that a man ""was noted [as] an advanced ‘Liberal’ but not a professional one (I consider the latter the lowest form of politician).""  We reached out to the Virginia Military Institute Archives about the quote. Mary Laura Kludy, the archives and records management specialist, told us that the school has no record of Patton saying it.  ""It is unlikely that it would have been from him,"" Kludy said. Brain Sobel, a media and governmental relations consultant who wrote the 2013 book, ""The Fighting Pattons,"" also told us that he’s never found any original source material showing that Patton said this.  ""Patton did have a general disdain for politics and politicians, but was basically ambivalent about politics,"" Sobel said.  We couldn’t find any original source confirming that Patton said this, and people familiar with his words suspect he did not.  If evidence emerges that the attribution is accurate, we’ll reconsider our rating.  For now, it’s False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970241C0>],/factchecks/2020/dec/04/viral-image/no-evidence-patton-said-about-liberal-democrats/

Affidavit in Michigan lawsuit seeking to overturn election makes wildly inaccurate claims about vote
","A lawsuit is asking a federal court in Michigan to force state leaders to disregard Michigan’s certified election results and award its 16 Electoral College votes to President Donald Trump. It includes an affidavit that makes wildly inaccurate claims about voter turnout in Michigan cities and townships. The affidavit comes from Russell James Ramsland Jr., a cybersecurity analyst and former Republican congressional candidate. Ramsland is the one who mistook voting jurisdictions in Minnesota for Michigan towns in a separate flawed analysis of voter turnout. His latest analysis correctly names Michigan voting jurisdictions, but similarly arrives at inaccurate voter turnout rates. For instance, Ramsland claims that Detroit saw a turnout of 139.29%. The city’s official results show that turnout in the city was actually 50.88% of registered voters. When asked about the error in Ramsland’s affidavit, Gregory Rohl, the attorney representing the plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit in Michigan, said he and his team would investigate the data. ""I’m always willing to learn and surely want the facts set forth to be accurate in any filing bearing my name,"" Rohl wrote in an email to PolitiFact Michigan.  Ramsland’s analysis gained public attention when a witness shared its inaccurate findings during a state House Oversight Committee hearing in Lansing Wednesday. During the hearing, Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, brought a number of witnesses to share allegations of election fraud and misconduct already discredited by election officials and in court. The witnesses included Col. Phil Waldron, who says he’s part of a team that looked into ""election manipulation."" He claimed that ""publicly available information"" from Michigan analyzed in an affidavit shows excessive voter turnout that indicates election fraud. But the numbers do not square with the statement of votes cast from Michigan counties. A chart included in Ramsland’s affidavit lists 21 Michigan cities and townships, five of which are alleged to have recorded a turnout above 90% in November’s election, while 10 purportedly saw turnout of exactly 100% and six surpassed 100%. It is difficult to imagine that a turnout rate above 100% — let alone 782% in the City of North Muskegon or 461% In Zeeland Charter Township — would have escaped election officials compiling the statement of votes cast. But beyond the implausible turnout rates Ramsland alleges, there are other glaring problems with the list. Shelby Township is named twice. So is Zeeland Charter Township, with two vastly different turnout rates: 90.59% and 460.51%. Ramsland lists ""Fenton"" without specifying Fenton City or Fenton Township. But the turnout Ramsland lists for Fenton does not match the turnout in either jurisdiction. The actual turnout statistics reveal the inaccuracy of Ramsland’s numbers. His figure for North Muskegon is off by a factor of 10: The actual number is 78.11%, not 781.91%. For Zeeland Charter Township, he inflated the turnout nearly sixfold. For Grout Township and the City of Muskegon, his number is more than triple the correct number.  There is one location where the actual turnout matches the turnout Ramsland lists: Grand Island Township, a tiny municipality split between an island in Lake Superior and a stretch of the Upper Peninsula’s mainland. Turnout there was 96.77%, according to the official record, as 30 out of the township’s 31 registered voters cast a ballot in November’s election. The 215.21% turnout rate Ramsland listed for Grout Township initially matched the data in the county’s statement of votes cast, but that’s because there was an error in the report. Gladwin County Clerk Laura Brandon-Maveal explained that the election results certified by the county are accurate, but that the number of registered voters used to compute the turnout rate was incorrect. ""We have to hand punch in the total number of registered voters and they put in the wrong number of registered voters,"" Brandon-Maveal said. The county released a corrected report Dec. 3. In a second affidavit Ramsland filed in the same lawsuit Dec. 3, he said that the information source for his first affidavit was data from the state’s open data portal and Secretary of State’s election results page ""that no longer exists."" The Secretary of State's office never shared township, city or precinct turnout data on its results page, according to Tracy Wimmer, a spokesperson for the office. This latest affidavit includes a new list of precincts in another attempt to demonstrate excessive turnout. It shows that ""Spring Lake Township, Precinct 6 — B"" had a turnout of 120%. Spring Lake Township’s clerk said that there’s no such precinct. Spring Lake Township Precinct 6 had a turnout of 66.74% in November’s election. The list also shows that one precinct in the City of South Haven had a 100% turnout rate. The city’s clerk said that there are only eight voters in that precinct, all of whom voted. Ramsland’s new list also showed 33 voting jurisdictions with turnout between 86.79% and 96.77%. An initial review indicated many of these turnout rates are accurate. Michigan had record turnout statewide. President-elect Joe Biden carried the state by more than 154,000 votes. An affidavit filed in a lawsuit in Michigan seeking to overturn the election purports to show turnout rates in Michigan that indicate election fraud. The numbers do not match the official statement of votes cast in all but one jurisdiction, and many inflate the numbers significantly. The official data show that the number of voters who cast a ballot in November’s election did not exceed the number of registered voters in any of the jurisdictions named.

Rick Scott’s claims about Charles Schumer lack evidence
","With the general election over, the nation’s political attention has shifted to Georgia, where runoff elections for two U.S. Senate seats take place on Jan. 5. Democrats need to win both for Sen. Charles Schumer to take over as Senate majority leader.  Sen. Rick Scott, incoming chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, a campaign committee focused on electing Republicans to the Senate, told Fox News his view on what would happen if the GOP lost and Schumer ascended to the leadership post.  We’re going to make sure @SenSchumer doesn’t get his wish to be Majority Leader. He said he wants to take Georgia so Democrats can change America. Thankfully, Georgia doesn’t want the radical change that Schumer, Warnock and Ossoff have in mind. pic.twitter.com/16SarGdbLg ""He wants to eliminate private health care insurance. He wants to ruin the Medicare program by putting everybody on the Medicare system. He wants the Green New Deal, which is going to cost close to $100 trillion and kill our economy, socialism, reduce funding for the police,"" Scott said.  In campaigns, using hyperbole to depict rivals is a common practice. We wanted to know whether the Florida senator described Schumer’s positions correctly.  Scott said Schumer, the senior senator from New York, ""wants to eliminate private health care insurance"" and put everyone on the Medicare system.  Schumer is not a co-sponsor of the ""Medicare for All"" bill sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. In August, during his speech at the Democratic National Convention, Schumer said Democrats would make ""health care affordable for all,"" but he did not elaborate.  In an interview with Vox in March 2019, Schumer was asked if Medicare for All would pass if Democrats controlled Congress and the White House. He replied: ""I can say this. Some strong health care bill would pass."" Asked about implementing a single-payer system, Schumer said he couldn’t predict if that would pass or not, and that views in his conference on the topic are mixed. Senate Democrats are interested in universal coverage, not just access, he said. Without endorsing Medicare for All, Schumer praised its supporters. ""And the energy for Medicare for All that’s out in the streets, it’s great. It pushes everything over that we need to move over,"" he said.  In April 2019, the Associated Press reported that Schumer ""stopped short of throwing his weight behind Sen. Bernie Sanders’ ‘Medicare for All’ plan.""   Thomas P. Miller, co-author of ""Why Obamacare’s Wrong for America,"" and a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that in 2009, during debate around the Affordable Care Act, Schumer proposed a kind of public option, but one that didn’t appeal to his colleagues further to the left. The model proposed by Schumer at the time was self-sustaining, not requiring government subsidy.  We also asked Miller about the broader context of Scott’s remarks, such as the likelihood that the Senate would pass a Medicare for All kind of system if Democrats were in charge. Miller said that would depend on the vote margins - big wins for Democrats could lead them to make greater changes to the health care system - but that he doubts Democrats would abandon private insurance altogether.  We reached out to Scott’s Senate spokesperson and the NRSC, both of which did not respond to calls and email messages.  Schumer’s spokesperson also declined to comment for this fact-check.  When Senate Republicans brought the Green New Deal to the floor -- not because any GOP member supported it, but to force an uncomfortable vote for vulnerable Democratic incumbents -- Schumer took to the Senate floor to condemn the move. He also condemned Senate Republicans for not putting forth meaningful legislation to combat climate change. But Schumer did not endorse the Green New Deal, as proposed by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass.  When a procedural vote on the Republicans’ Green New Deal plan came up, Schumer voted present, as did many of his Democratic colleagues.  The Green New Deal, as proposed by Markey, is a resolution calling on Congress to create legislation that would achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, investments in infrastructure, job creation, clean air and water and healthy food, among other things. Without other legislation, it would not have the force of law if passed. The resolution has been referred to committee in the Senate.  While Schumer has not co-sponsored the Green New Deal, he has co-sponsored the ""Thrive Agenda,"" a resolution that calls for combating climate change while investing in minority communities and creating jobs. It has been supported by the Green New Deal Network, a coalition of organizations such as the Sunrise Movement, which has been a foremost proponent of the Green New Deal.  Scott also said that Schumer wants to ""reduce funding for the police.""  Schumer has endorsed a criminal justice reform bill, the ""Justice in Policing Act."" The bill encourages policing reforms and withholds federal funds if local departments do not make changes, but also provides funding for training. The Congressional Research Service, which produces objective analyses of legislation for members of Congress, found that the receipt of certain federal funds would be conditional on whether state and local agencies prohibited the use of no-knock warrants in certain drug cases, as well as banned choke-holds, and changed use of force standards so the use of deadly force is only used as a last resort to prevent imminent death or serious bodily injury. The legislation also limits transfer of certain military-grade equipment, primarily weapons and vehicles used in combat, to state and local departments.    In June, Schumer opposed a resolution from Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., opposing efforts to defund the police. In itself, this opposition was not a vote to reduce funding for police.   Schumer has not said exactly what kind of policies he would pursue if he becomes majority leader, and he has said repeatedly that ""everything is on the table.""  Scott said that Schumer was in favor of Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and reducing funding for police.  Schumer is not on record supporting Medicare for All, though he has said that a strong health care bill would pass if Democrats take control of the Senate.  He is not a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, though he does support legislation to combat climate change supported by a coalition of progressive organizations, known as the Green New Deal Network.  Schumer supports legislation to make the receipt of federal funds by local and state governments conditional on adopting certain reforms. It would not reduce police funding automatically.    We rate Scott’s statement False.   ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096874B80>],/factchecks/2020/dec/04/rick-scott/scotts-claims-about-schumer-lack-evidence/
"['China', 'Facebook Fact-checks', 'Coronavirus', 'Viral image']","
China has a vaccine and new COVID-19 cases have recently been reported there
","As the U.S. inches closer than ever toward an available COVID-19 vaccine, misinformation about both the disease and how to prevent it are spreading online.  One image being shared on social media makes a claim about China, where the first case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019.  ""Why did China recover without a vaccine?"" the image says. ""And why doesn’t anybody talk about it?""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  First of all, China already has a COVID-19 vaccine.  In late November, the chair of a Chinese pharmaceutical company said in an interview with a Chinese newspaper that nearly 1 million people in the country had used its COVID-19 vaccines. But experts have also credited the country for curbing the spread of the coronavirus by taking other measures. In a nutshell: China moved quickly compared to other countries. Wuhan, where the first case was reported in December 2019, was put on a strict lockdown for more than two months and 9 million people were tested for COVID-19 there within weeks. Public transportation was suspended and across the country 14,000 health checkpoints were established. Residents were severely restricted from moving outside their homes. And China effectively enacted a nationwide contact tracing system. By September, the executive director of the World Health Organization’s health emergencies program was congratulating the Chinese for working ""together tirelessly to bring the disease to this very low level.""  In October, The Lancet medical journal reported that China had managed to control the pandemic rapidly and effectively. The journal credited that feat to a few factors. The country already has a centralized epidemic response system. Few elderly Chinese residents live in nursing facilities, which were a major source of infection in some western countries. And because of the severity of the SARS outbreak in 2002, most adults there were cognizant of what could happen during the coronavirus outbreak.    Chinese residents also broadly complied with mask rules unlike in the United States, where many Americans have refused to wear masks even as cases surge. In China, people were publicly shamed for not wearing masks. ""Drones equipped with echoing loudspeakers rebuked Chinese citizens who were not following the rules,"" according to the Lancet. ""‘Yes Auntie, this drone is talking to you,’ one device proclaimed to a surprised woman in Inner Mongolia. ‘You shouldn’t walk around without wearing a mask. You’d better go home and wash your hands.’"" While restrictions in China are now similar to those in place throughout Europe and the United States, NBC News reported, widespread compliance in China appears to be making a difference. As of Dec. 3, China had 93,203 cases and 4,744 COVID-19 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. That’s far fewer cases and deaths than in the United States, which has recorded more than 14 million cases and more than 275,250 deaths.  Ali Mokdad, a professor of global health at the University of Washington, told NBC that China’s success is possible only through restrictions on individual freedoms that wouldn’t be tolerated here. Its approach has been criticized for being draconian.  But the country is still grappling with COVID-19. After multiple locally-transmitted cases were identified in three cities in November, Chinese officials tested millions of people for the disease and initiated new lockdowns and shuttered schools. ""Recent flareups have shown that there is still a risk of the virus returning, despite being largely controlled in China,"" the Associated Press reported.   The National Health Commission in China recently announced that ""strict containment measures should be taken"" in the winter and spring to prevent cases of COVID-19. The Facebook post says that China has recovered from the coronavirus without a vaccine.  Through a number of severe restrictions, widespread testing, and high compliance among residents there, the country has largely succeeded in bringing the virus to heel but it has not returned to normal operations. In schools, for example, millions of children wear masks and have their temperature checked multiple times a day. And new cases of COVID-19 are still being identified in China.  The country also has a vaccine, and Chinese officials say nearly 1 million people have been vaccinated.  We rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978C5340>],/factchecks/2020/dec/04/viral-image/china-has-vaccine-and-new-covid-19-cases-have-rece/

Alleged ‘backdated’ ballots wouldn’t have been counted even if USPS claim were true
","A U.S. Postal Service contractor working in Wisconsin during the election claims USPS workers told him about 100,000 ""missing"" ballots and a move to backdate ballots. The claims from this purported whistleblower are being trumpeted by an array of conservative news outlets and personalities — including President Donald Trump — amid the ongoing effort to discredit and overturn election results in Wisconsin. Claims of widespread voter fraud across the U.S. have been presented without evidence and led to a string of defeats in court. But this claim carries a particularly noteworthy bit of absurdity — even if it were 100% true, it would not have altered the Wisconsin election results by a single vote. Ethan Pease, a temporary employee of a subcontractor, told his story shortly after the election, but it has found renewed life after he appeared at a Dec. 1, 2020, press conference in Arlington, VA, then made appearances on Fox News with Sean Hannity and Fox Business with Lou Dobbs. Trump posted the press conference video on his YouTube channel. Various write-ups of this claim appeared on an array of conservative websites and were widely shared on Facebook. These stories were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Many narratives citing Pease connect his claim to improperly counted votes. Dobbs introduced Pease as a man who ""has come forward charging postal workers backdated 100,000 mail-in ballots so they could be illegally counted."" The Lutchman Report website said ballots were backdated ""so that the ballots would be counted even if they arrived after the statutory deadline."" But that’s simply not possible — the Wisconsin deadline is based on when ballots are received, not postmarked. Let’s dig into the details. Pease’s claim — sworn to in an affidavit that is being used in a lawsuit challenging the election results — is based on two conversations he had with USPS workers while filling a delivery role around the election. Pease said he started his job Aug. 26, 2020, as a temporary employee with United Mailing Services, working as a route and box truck driver in the Madison area. His job was to pick up mail and bring it back to UMS, which then sorted it so he could drive the sorted mail to USPS. That mail included ballots housed in separate bins. Here’s Pease’s description of the interactions the day after the Nov. 3 election. Nov. 4, I was asked by a senior USPS employee named Monte if I had forgotten any ballots the night before. Monte explained that an order came down from the Wisconsin-Illinois chapter of USPS that 100,000 ballots were missing. Monte then told me that his post office had dispatched employees to look for the missing ballots around 4 a.m., and that only seven or eight were found at UMS. Based on my previous experience and habit of double-checking for ballots, I believed that to be a lie. The following day, Nov. 5, 2020, I had a conversation with a different USPS employee named Rachel, in which she admitted USPS employees were ordered to backdate ballots that were received too late to be lawfully counted. At this point we can’t address the validity of Pease’s claims, though it’s noteworthy they come from a temporary employee of a subcontractor based on his interpretation of conversations, not any direct observation. The USPS did not immediately respond to an email asking if they are investigating the matter. But we do know this had no impact on the election results. The widely shared social media posts built around Pease generally connect his claims to illegally counting those votes, though Pease never made that claim himself in the press conferences or Fox appearances. And that connection is fraught with logical impossibilities. The biggest by far is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Wisconsin voting deadline. An array of litigation on absentee ballots in Wisconsin ended Oct. 26 with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling absentee ballots would only be counted if they were returned by Election Day — upholding previous practice. Democrats and other nonpartisan groups had sought changes allowing ballots to be counted if they were postmarked by Election Day, even if they were received later. So local election workers across the state only counted absentee ballots that were submitted by the time polls closed on Election Day. The entirety of Pease’s allegations involve actions taken Nov. 4 and 5. In terms of the vote tally, it doesn’t matter what USPS employees did with ballots at that point. No election officials were going to count them. And the entire state had already reported its election results (Milwaukee County was last about 4 a.m. Nov. 4) In Madison, where Pease worked, the last election results were reported the night of the election. Reid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, summed it up this way, addressing Pease’s claims: ""In Wisconsin, no ballots received after 8 p.m. on Tuesday, November 3, could be counted, period. It doesn’t matter when they were postmarked. This was extensively litigated in federal courts in the weeks prior to the election and everyone, including the post office, knew that postmarks were immaterial to whether ballots were counted in Wisconsin."" We should also note that some conspiracy theories online connect the timing of Pease’s comment — a ballot search at 4 a.m. Nov. 4 — to the ""vote dump"" claims that allege a jump in votes for Democrat Joe Biden in the wee hours of Nov. 4 is somehow questionable. The vote dump claim has been repeatedly debunked: The increase in votes was simply when the City of Milwaukee finished counting its absentee ballots, which were predictably heavily in Biden’s favor. But the connection is illogical on its face as well. It’s ridiculous to assert a jump in reported votes occurred at the same time employees were searching for ballots across an array of facilities. That supposed correlation leaves no time for ballots to be transported to election officials, verified, counted and added to tallies. Our ruling An array of social media posts have seized on statements from a ""whistleblower"" to say the USPS backdated 100K ballots so they could be counted illegally. We can’t yet gauge the validity of the back-dating claims, but we do know it’s ridiculous to say this affected the Wisconsin vote totals. Absentee ballots had to be received by the time polls closed on Election Day to be counted, and all state election results were reported by the early morning hours of Nov. 4. Pease’s claims relate to actions allegedly taken Nov. 4 and 5. Whatever happened to ballots then, no one was going to count and include them. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978FFE00>],/factchecks/2020/dec/04/facebook-posts/alleged-backdated-ballots-wouldnt-have-been-counte/

No, Georgia election workers didn’t kick out observers and illegally count ‘suitcases’ of ballots
","Georgia election officials disputed a video promoted by President Donald Trump’s campaign as evidence of election fraud, saying the footage shows nothing but ""normal ballot processing."" The surveillance video was introduced as proof of illegal activity by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his team during a Dec. 3 hearing with Georgia state legislators. The Trump campaign then circulated One America News Network’s live coverage of the event online. Social media posts sharing the video were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The posts claim the video footage shows election workers at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena telling election observers to leave, pulling suitcases filled with ballots from under a table, and illegally counting them with no observers present. ""Smoking gun,"" one Facebook post said. That interpretation is wrong, however. The footage doesn’t show any wrongdoing, said Gabriel Sterling, a Republican and Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, in a Dec. 4 tweet. ""The 90 second video of election workers at State Farm arena, purporting to show fraud was watched in its entirety (hours) by @GaSecofState investigators,"" Sterling wrote, linking to a fact-check from Lead Stories. ""Shows normal ballot processing.""  The 90 second video of election workers at State Farm arena, purporting to show fraud was watched in its entirety (hours) by @GaSecofState investigators. Shows normal ballot processing. Here is the fact check on it. https://t.co/HVJsvDjDvi Reporters for Lead Stories spoke with Sterling about the surveillance video. They also talked to Frances Watson, the Georgia secretary of state’s chief investigator, and an unidentified state election board monitor who was present in the room late on election night. The ballots seen in the video were not in suitcases, the officials told Lead Stories. They were in standard ballot containers. And there was nothing illegal about the way they were processed.  In reality, the ballots had been removed from their envelopes and processed while news media personnel and observers were still in the room. Nobody was ever told to leave, Watson told Lead Stories. But some observers exited after the election workers responsible for opening the envelopes and verifying the ballots had finished their job and started taking off for the night. The observers were allowed to return at any time, Watson told Lead Stories. Lead Stories and Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that while the state’s law allows partisan observers to watch, it does not actually require that they be present for ballots to be counted. That lines up with the sequence of events Sterling described in response to a Facebook post about the video. Here’s what he said: ""When the workers began packing up to go, there were two groups, the cutters and the counters. Cutters opened, stacked and prepared ballots for scanning. Scanners … well, they scanned. All of them heard a supervisor say we are finishing for the night, because the cutters had completed their work. The scanners heard they were ‘done’ and started packing up to leave. During that time the elections director called the absentee supervisor at State Farm to tell him the scanners needed to continue their work. So people had already started to leave or had left … cutters, media, monitors. But the video shows no new boxes of ballots brought out from a table, they were all there when the media and monitors were in the room. The video shows them getting back to work scanning. When the (state elections board) monitor arrives they continue to do the same thing they had been doing all night. When the (secretary of state) investigator got there they continued doing the same thing."" Sterling also addressed claims about the video in an interview on Newsmax and walked through the surveillance tape with a WSB-TV reporter. Richard Barron, the elections director in Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, also addressed the issue with the county’s elections officials. In a video published online by 11Alive, the NBC affiliate TV station in Atlanta, he described sending instructions for the scanners to keep going. ""No announcement was ever made to leave, for anyone to leave,"" Barron said. ""Certain staff that were on the cutting stations, that were on the flattening stations, that were extracting from the inner envelopes, those staff left as work completed. I found out sometime, I think a little after 10:30, that they were going to cease operations, and I told them not to do that."" ""It was normal processing that occurred there,"" said Barron, who added that the plastic bins shown in the video were ""bins that they keep under their desks near the scanners."" Other reporters also disputed claims that the video showed illegal counting by election workers. Fulton County tweeted Dec. 4 that it was ""aware of no credible reports of voter fraud.""  A spokesperson for OAN said the video shared by Trump’s campaign and supporters was taken from the network’s live coverage of Giuliani’s presentation at the hearing in Georgia. The source and presentation of the video was not originally from OAN, the spokesperson said. The Georgia secretary of state’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Social media posts claim that video from Georgia shows suitcases filled with ballots pulled from under a table and illegally counted after election observers were told to leave. That’s wrong. State officials have said there was no suitcase, no instruction to leave, and no illegal counting of ballots. The video does not prove that the bins shown contained fraudulent ballots, either. We rate these Facebook posts False.

No, residents that Wisconsin officials suspected of moving are not ""illegal voters""
","A list of Wisconsin voters who state officials believed recently moved was a source of ongoing controversy in the runup to the 2020 election.  The state planned to use this information to update the voter rolls by 2021 — knowing the list contained errors — but many conservatives pushed to have those people pulled off the rolls of registered voters before this year’s election. That didn’t happen. But now President Donald Trump is raising the matter again amid a flurry of other baseless voter fraud claims. Trump took aim at the Wisconsin system — built by Republicans — in a Dec. 2, 2020, speech, including this callback to the contested cleanup of the Wisconsin voter rolls: ""In Wisconsin, the state’s Board of Elections could not confirm the residency of more than 100,000 people, but repeatedly refused to remove those names from its voter rolls before the election,"" Trump said. ""They knew why, nobody else did. I knew why. They were illegal voters."" Trump raises a new issue here, going so far as calling the people on this list illegal voters. So let’s look back at what we know. And why that description is wrong. This controversy dates to October 2019, when the Wisconsin Elections Commission sent mailers to 232,000 people saying it believed they may have moved, asking them to update their voter registration or confirm if they lived at the same address. The commission planned to remove people from the roll in 2021 if the resident took no action. But three voters — represented by Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty — filed a lawsuit in November 2019 arguing the state had to remove the names from the rolls faster. Ozaukee County Judge Paul Malloy agreed and ordered the names be stricken from the voter rolls.  An appeals court later ruled against Malloy, keeping names on the rolls, and an appeal of that is pending before the state Supreme Court. RELATED: Are dead people among the names in Wisconsin voter roll purge? In the meantime, the list shrunk — both from people updating their addresses and from thousands confirming they were wrongly listed as having moved. As of May, about 4,700 voters who were flagged as moving reported they were actually still at their same address.  The list of potential movers was down to 129,000 as of early 2020. That brings us to the core of Trump’s claim: That those remaining on the list at the time of the Nov. 3 election were ""illegal voters."" This is simply wrong. No officials ever asserted these people were unqualified to vote. Even if they had been removed from the list, these voters could have cast a ballot in November by simply re-registering at the polls or anytime before. And we know from voting records that most people in this group were regulars at the polls. Records show 72% of the original 232,000 on the movers list had voted in the 2016 presidential election, and 89% had voted in at least one election since 2006. We have seen no evidence that people included on the list voted improperly in the Nov. 3 election. Among those left on the list prior to the election, those who moved would have been able to register and vote at their new address. And those who hadn’t moved would have been able to vote at their usual polling place, since they remained registered there. Trump said in a speech that residents the Election Commission suspected of moving are ""illegal voters."" But there’s absolutely no factual or logical basis to this claim. Most people on this list have been regular voters, and nothing about being on the list makes them ineligible to vote.  It was just an effort to clarify where voters lived. We rate this False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F11780>],/factchecks/2020/dec/04/donald-trump/no-residents-wisconsin-officials-suspected-moving-/
"['Missouri', 'Liberty Alliance']","
George Soros is not the mastermind behind startup news outlet the Missouri Independent
","The Missouri Independent is a news outlet that was founded in October in partnership with States Newsroom, a national nonprofit funded by grants, donors and readers. It has created nonprofit news organizations in 19 U.S. states. Liberty Alliance, which advocates for conservative causes, has accused the Missouri Independent of being a liberal propaganda outlet created by left-leaning philanthropist George Soros. In a Facebook post, the group told their supporters, ""Beware - George Soros is starting a Fake News site in Missouri. Don’t fall for it - the Missouri Independent is BAD NEWS."" The group has repeatedly made this claim online and even called for conservative elected officials to refuse to give interviews or provide comment to the outlet. This all came to a head when Republican Gov. Mike Parson refused to answer Missouri Independent reporter and deputy editor Rudi Keller’s question at a Nov. 5 press conference. ""First of all Rudi, I’m not gonna answer your question,"" Parson said before Keller had a chance to speak. ""But I’m gonna tell you this: I am not going to respond to a c4 (nonprofit) out of Virginia that is absolutely a propaganda news agency… This political agenda, whether it’s George Soros or people like him, of what you’re gonna be doing is not fair to Missouri outlets."" Before co-founding the Missouri Independent, Keller worked for 22 years at the Columbia Daily Tribune and spent 30 years as a journalist. Liberty Alliance has even created a website devoted to trashing the Missouri Independent and its founders. In addition to calling the founders ""Liberals who have made a career of attacking Conservatives,"" it repeats the claim that Soros is behind it all. ""George Soros-connected entities started the States Newsroom network as a pet project to spread misinformation to appease their Liberal donors,"" it reads. Soros is a Jewish Hungarian whose family hid from the Nazis during the Holocaust and later fled a communist regime in their home country. He eventually emigrated to the United States and became a hedge fund tycoon and one of the wealthiest men in the world. He has used that wealth to support countless liberal causes, largely through his charity, the Open Society Foundations. Conservatives have criticized his use of personal wealth to affect U.S. politics in favor of liberal causes. Soros has also been the target of countless right-wing conspiracy theories including that he is a former Nazi officer, that he’s made it his ""life’s mission to destroy the United States"" and that he instigated racial protests in Charlottesville, Va. PolitiFact and other independent fact-checkers have found these to be false. Chris Vas, the executive director of Liberty Alliance, pointed to an investigation done by the Open Secrets Center for Responsive Politics, a research group tracking money in U.S. politics and its effect on elections and public policy. The investigation detailed a number of news outlets and their financial connections and briefly mentions States Newsroom. It found that States Newsroom had a connection to the Hopewell Fund, a liberal charity that promotes various social projects and left-wing causes, that Vas alleges is run by Soros. States Newsroom’s connection to the Hopewell Fund goes back to the early days of the news organization, before the Missouri Independent was founded. States Newsroom is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit supported by grants and donors. According to Influence Watch, an online database that tracks influencers of public policy, the Hopewell Fund served as a fiscal sponsor before States Newsroom’s tax-exempt status was approved in July 2019. In November that year, the two organizations separated. Fiscal sponsorship allowed States Newsroom — then known as Newsroom Network — to use Hopewell’s legal and tax-exempt status until its nonprofit status was approved. This is a common practice among nonprofits. The Hopewell Fund also managed its funding and performed all the administrative and business functions, such as human resources and legal compliance. States Newsroom and the Missouri Independent said that despite that assistance, the Hopewell Fund did not give any money to the news outlet. The Hopewell Fund’s 2018 IRS 990 tax form — which can be accessed via ProPublica’s nonprofit database — shows that the charity did not give States Newsroom or any affiliated organization more than $5,000. The form does not disclose donations smaller than that. Even if they did, is the Hopewell Fund run by Soros? There is no evidence of this. Based on that IRS 990 tax form, we know that Soros doesn’t serve as an executive there. We also looked through the IRS 990 tax forms filed by Soros’s organization, the Open Society Foundations as well as its sister organization, the Foundation to Promote Open Society, dating back to 2015, the year the Hopewell Fund was founded. We found that neither gave money to the Hopewell Fund. Additionally, neither gave money to States Newsroom or any of its affiliates. At times, projects funded by the Hopewell Fund and Open Society Foundations overlapped. That’s not unusual, and none of them amounted to Soros and Open Society Foundations controlling the Hopewell Fund. States Newsroom discloses all donations over $500. Neither the Hopewell Fund nor Soros are listed as donors. Andrea Verykoukis, deputy director of States Newsroom, also said it received no donations from Soros or the Hopewell Fund. Additionally, Thomas Watson, a representative of the Open Society Foundations, said that neither Soros nor his foundation have given funding to States Newsroom or the Missouri Independent. We reached out to Jason Hancock, editor-in-chief and co-founder the Missouri Independent to discuss their policies. Formerly the lead political reporter for The Kansas City Star, Hancock has spent nearly two decades working for news organizations across the Midwest. The Missouri Independent, like other States Newsroom affiliates, is free to read and has no ads. Unlike many traditional newspapers, it funds its journalism through donations made by readers, grants and foundations, but Hancock said this is the only difference between it and other outlets. Where traditional newspapers have subscribers and advertisers, the Missouri Independent has donors. ""Ultimately, what we’re doing is not that much different from any other newsroom,"" he said. On its website, the Missouri Independent contends that it retains ""full editorial independence, and all editorial decisions are made by our journalists. Donors have no influence over content."" The site pushes investigative beat reporting in state government. Like traditional newspapers, its commentary section is separate from news.  Hancock compared the Missouri Independent’s business model to NPR-affiliated news radio stations that are usually nonprofit and largely funded by donors and grants. Hancock said that fundraising is left to the national offices at States Newsroom and that the Missouri Independent doesn’t deal with any fundraising matters directly. He said that even if he were to cover an event involving a large donor, he would have never met that donor. ""I’m aware of some of the small donors because they may have reached out, like readers who donated 10 bucks or 25 bucks or something like that, but those are the only donors that I’m aware of,"" he said. Hancock said even if Soros cut him a check, his coverage wouldn’t change. He said it’s no different than not letting advertisers dictate your coverage at a traditional newspaper. ""At the end of the day,"" Hancock said. ""if you’re gonna judge us, judge us based on our work, which I think stands with any other journalistic work out there."" Liberty Alliance said, ""George Soros is starting a Fake News site in Missouri,"" referring to the Missouri Independent, but there’s no evidence of Soros being involved. Liberty Alliance points to the Missouri Independent’s parent organization, States Newsroom, and its ties to the Hopewell Fund as evidence. But IRS tax forms tell us that Soros’s foundations have not given any money to the Hopewell Fund, States Newsroom or the Missouri Independent. Soros does not serve in any sort of officer capacity for these organizations. The Missouri Independent is not a ""fake news"" site. It’s a news organization covering state government politics and policy — not a website peddling hoaxes. Therefore, we rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F26E80>],/factchecks/2020/dec/04/liberty-alliance/george-soros-not-mastermind-behind-startup-news-ou/
"['North Carolina', 'Coronavirus', 'Mandy Cohen']","
In NC, COVID-19 deaths surpass 10 years of flu deaths
","Like many states, North Carolina is tracking a record number of COVID-19 cases this holiday season. And in an attempt to explain the severity of the illness, the state’s top health official compared coronavirus deaths to data on the flu. ""Sadly more than 5,000 North Carolinians have lost their lives from this virus since our first death on March 12 of this year,"" Health Secretary Mandy Cohen said during a Dec. 1 press conference. ""To give some perspective, just under 1,500 people died from the flu in the past 10 years,"" Cohen said. ""In just 11 months, Covid has killed more than three times that number."" Is it true that the coronavirus has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in 10 years? According to the state’s data, yes. North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services tracks both COVID-19 and influenza deaths. As of Wednesday morning, the state had counted 5,284 COVID-19 deaths. DHHS says those deaths include people who have had a positive molecular or antigen test for COVID-19, who died without fully recovering from COVID-19, and who had no alternative cause of death identified.  The deaths are reported by hospitals and clinicians directly to the local and state health departments. The first reported COVID-19 death did, indeed, occur on March 12.  The state’s health department also tracks flu deaths and reports each flu season’s data on its website. Flu deaths are reported by health providers and were confirmed as influenza by an appropriate laboratory or rapid diagnostic test. PolitiFact reviewed the last 10 flu seasons, dating back to the 2010-2011 season. In total, we counted 1,486 reported flu deaths. DHHS spokeswoman Kelly Haight confirmed to us by phone that our total is accurate. Here’s a list of the flu death counts by season, and a link to the report for each respective season: 2019-2020: 186 2018-2019: 203 2017-2018: 391 2016-2017: 218 2015-2016: 59 2014-2015: 218 2013-2014: 107 2012-2013: 59 2011-2012: 9 2010-2011: 36 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also tracks flu deaths by state. At a glance, it might seem like the CDC and North Carolina reports contradict one other. For instance, the CDC reported North Carolina had 2,064 flu deaths in 2018, while the state’s health department reported far less. That’s because the CDC sometimes combines flu and pneumonia deaths together, officials said. Under the ""flu & pneumonia"" section on the CDC’s flu deaths by state website, ""most of those deaths are pneumonia deaths,"" said Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications for the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. Some pneumonia deaths are caused by the flu, but some can be caused by ""many other viruses, bacteria, bacteria-like organisms and fungi,"" said Kelly Haight, DHHS spokeswoman. The year 2018 is the most recent year of flu deaths available on the CDC site.  If you start in 2018 and look back 10 years to 1999, Lancashire said ""there were 1,806 deaths from exclusively flu alone – without pneumonia (from the public database CDC WONDER – wonder.cdc.gov).""   ""So if Dr. Cohen was citing deaths from flu alone, she would be correct that COVID19 deaths have exceeded that (number) in NC,"" he said.   The CDC has noted, however, that tallying death counts for COVID-19, flu and pneumonia is complicated and sometimes its data can be incomplete. Cohen said COVID-19 has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in the last 10 years. By the North Carolina health department’s count, there have been 5,200 COVID-19 deaths this year and 1,486 flu deaths over the last decade. Cohen’s claim also tracks with data collected by the CDC, according to an agency spokesman. However, the CDC points out that exact numbers can be tricky to count because there are sometimes delays in processing death information. We rate her statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097102540>],/factchecks/2020/dec/04/mandy-cohen/nc-covid-19-deaths-surpass-10-years-flu-deaths/

Yes, GOP did oppose $40 million for lead pipe replacement because it helped Milwaukee too much
","Has Milwaukee’s position as Wisconsin’s largest city as well as a Democratic stronghold put Brewtown in the crosshairs of state Republicans?  State Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, alluded to the city’s treatment by Republicans about a week before the election, in an Oct. 26, 2020, tweet marking National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week: ""I'm so glad we have a Governor who cares and wants to help WI cities get to 0% lead piping. Sadly, in 2019, Republicans stripped $40 million from the budget for lead pipe replacement - because they thought it helped MKE too much.""  That caught our attention.  Did Republican lawmakers strip funding from the budget for lead pipe replacement because it would help Milwaukee too much?  Under Evers' plan, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, state officials would have borrowed nearly $40 million over the two-year budget period to create a forgivable loan program for local governments to help pay for lead pipe replacements. The borrowing also would have created a separate grant program that would allow farmers to build infrastructure aimed at reducing pollution and help rid contaminants in the Milwaukee River and St. Louis River, which is in northwest Wisconsin. Evers' proposal would have paid for up to 50 percent of the cost of replacing a lead water service line in Milwaukee, if the city qualified for the state program. According to Milwaukee Water Works, there is no lead in the city’s drinking water when it leaves treatment plants.  But there is a danger in the water -- especially in older homes -- because old service lines, which run to individual houses, and interior plumbing may contain lead, which can leach into the water. The most fundamental solution, in Milwaukee and elsewhere, is to replace the old pipes with copper ones, but other interim steps can make a difference, such as assuring at-risk homes have filters on their taps. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to cause developmental delays and learning difficulties in children. Lead exposure also harms adults, who may suffer high blood pressure, joint pain, headaches and an increased risk of having a miscarriage or premature birth.  As of Dec. 31, 2019, the Milwaukee Water Works reported 74,416 lead service lines within its service area, according to Department of Public Works spokesman Brian DeNeve. About 70,000 of those are residential.  Those 70,000 residential lead service lines account for about 40% of the total statewide.  The proposed $40 million in bonding could have led to the replacement of 9% of the state's 170,000 lead service lines still in use, the Evers administration estimated. When asked to provide backup for Larson’s statement, spokesman Justin Bielinski pointed to news articles detailing GOP objections in the wake of the Evers proposal. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, said the plan was too expensive.  ""I feel like the simple answer was to just say we're going to have government pay for all these lead lateral replacements,"" Vos said, according to an April 10, 2019, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. ""But the number nationwide is trillions of dollars, which we will never have the ability — at least in Wisconsin — to be able to do things like that everywhere across the state."" In the same article, state Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, who co-chairs the Legislature’s budget-writing committee, singled out the Milwaukee funding.   ""My understanding is that the proposal — a vast majority of it — is going to Milwaukee,"" Nygren said. ""We had targeted our response to the lead issue as a local opportunity for communities to get involved and provide assistance at the local level, rather than people from Marinette funding lead replacements in Milwaukee. I'm not sure that that's necessarily fair from a taxpayer standpoint."" Meanwhile, a  video titled ""Milwaukee Tries to Pass the Buck on Lead Lateral Replacement"" posted May 20, 2019 by the MacIver Institute to YouTube, shows Vos praising Madison’s efforts to replace lead laterals on its own, without a state mandate, and notes the laterals are owned by homeowners, not taxpayers. ""The City of Madison did a great job over the past dozen years getting rid of lead laterals on their own without a mandate from the state,"" Vos said.  In the video, Vos says those who have already paid to upgrade their laterals should not have to now pay the cost of replacing laterals owned by others. In its description of the video, the MacIver Institute, a conservative think tank, describes this as a ""handout"" to the city from state taxpayers. In May 2019, the Legislature voted along party lines to remove many of Evers’ most significant proposals from his state budget, including the lead proposal.  So, in short, before striking the money from the budget, several GOP leaders cited the fact too much of it would go to Milwaukee. But they also cited other factors, including questioning whether an effort financed by state taxpayers was an appropriate way to tackle the problem. In a tweet, Larson said ""In 2019, Republicans stripped $40 million from the budget for lead pipe replacement - because they thought it helped MKE too much."" At least two key leaders opposed the program, citing -- in part -- the amount of money that would go to the City of Milwaukee. But there were other factors cited as well. Our definition for Mostly True is ""The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""  That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3D0BC0>],/factchecks/2020/dec/04/chris-larson/yes-gop-did-oppose-40-million-lead-pipe-replacemen/

Masks do not kill people and do not reduce blood oxygen levels
","For more than seven minutes, a video on Facebook shows a man in a large brown chair reading calmly from his notes, predicting global food shortages as ""a side effect of the coronavirus hoax,"" and misleading about the use of masks to prevent the spread of the virus. About 34 seconds in, the man says: ""The masks will kill quite a few people, it’s well known that they reduce blood oxygen levels and those with respiratory and cardiac disorders will die. It’s true that surgeons wear masks, but they are different masks and different circumstances and not usually worn all day."" As he reads in a matter-of-fact tone, big red capital letters frame the video: ""They want to kill 6 billion of us. Here’s how they will do it."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The man in the Facebook video was described by The Bangkok Post, a Thailand-based news outlet as a doctor, prolific author, and former newspaper columnist ""who has built a career on being anti-establishment,"" and is now ""peddling played-out COVID-19 conspiracy theories."" This video includes several unfounded and wrong claims, but this fact-check will focus on the claim about masks having a deadly effect. Bottom line: Public health experts say masks are effective in reducing the spread of the coronavirus, and while some people may experience some discomfort wearing them, masks are generally safe to use. (The American Lung Association has suggestions on how to get used to wearing a mask.) For months, people around the world have been using masks to prevent getting or spreading the coronavirus. We found no credible reports of people dying as a result of wearing a mask. Reuters in October debunked a false claim that three children in Germany died from wearing face masks. PolitiFact has also fact-checked a lot of misinformation about masks. No, masks do not shut down or weaken the immune system. No, masks will not reduce blood oxygen levels. ""As a pulmonologist — a doctor who specializes in the respiratory system — I can assure you that behind that mask, your breathing is fine. You’re getting all the oxygen you need, and your carbon dioxide levels aren’t rising,"" Jonathan Parsons, a pulmonologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and director of the Ohio State Asthma Center, wrote in an August blog post. Parsons wrote that people who experience anxiety or claustrophobia when wearing a mask can try to calm themselves by taking long, slow breaths. Thomas Tsai, a surgeon and health policy researcher at Harvard’s School of Public Health, told PolitiFact in May that, ""on the margins we could probably find extreme cases where someone, somewhere with some condition has had an issue with a mask, but that's not the average."" Tsai said there was no data suggesting that it was harmful to wear a standard surgical or cloth mask under normal situations. N95 masks (ones that create a tight seal) are considered to be the most effective in protecting the wearer from airborne particles, and are commonly used by health care workers. Because of a shortage of those masks, public health officials recommended that the general public instead use other types of masks, like cloth masks, and reserve the N95s for health care workers who are routinely exposed to patients with COVID-19. The American Lung Association says that people with chronic lung diseases may be asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 and should wear cloth face masks in public areas. There is some evidence that prolonged use of N-95 masks in patients with preexisting lung disease could cause some build-up of carbon dioxide levels in the body, the association said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters earlier this year that the level of carbon dioxide likely to build up in a mask ""is mostly tolerable to people exposed to it"" and that it is ""unlikely to cause hypercapnia,"" a condition that develops when there is too much carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. The CDC also says that most people with underlying medical conditions can and should wear masks. People with respiratory conditions who remain concerned about wearing a mask safely should talk with their healthcare provider, the CDC said. The CDC does not recommend masks for children under 2 years old or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. A video in a Facebook post claimed, ""Masks will kill quite a few people, it’s well known that they reduce blood oxygen levels and those with respiratory and cardiac disorders will die."" We found no credible reports of people dying because they used masks to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Public health experts say it is not true that masks reduce blood oxygen levels. The CDC says that people with underlying medical conditions should still wear masks. The post is not factual.

Arizona sheriff says Obama called global warming America’s ‘top’ national security threat
","Paul Babeu, the Republican Sheriff of Pinal County, Ariz., near the U.S.-Mexico border, has repeatedly criticized President Barack Obama’s administration for its lack of border security. Babeu, who’s running for Congress this November against a Republican field that includes David Gowan, Ken Bennett and Wendy Rogers, warned of Mexican drug cartels in his county ahead of Memorial Day weekend on Fox News’ Hannity on May 26.

Out of context In March, after the terrorist attacks in Brussels, Obama said, ""I’ve got a lot of things of my plate, but my top priority is to defeat ISIL."" When we asked for evidence on climate change being the top priority, Tim Gaffney, a spokesman with the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office, noted that Obama has made this claim during speaking engagements. Obama has said global warming is a serious threat and has linked it to national security. But, looking back at news reports over the last year, Obama has never explicitly said it was the top national security threat. Rather, he has said global warming is a threat to the whole world. In an April 2015 weekly address, he said ""there’s no greater threat to our planet than climate change.""   In May 2015, Obama also said during a U.S. Coast Guard Academy commencement address that climate change ""is one of those most severe threats."" ""So I’m here today to say that climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security,"" Obama said. ""And make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country."" We should also point out that the U.S. military has focused on the potential threat of climate change going back to President George W. Bush’s administration. In a December 2015 interview, Obama defended his remarks on climate change, noting at the same time that while terrorists will be ""defeated,"" climate change is the ""kind of crisis that we can’t deal with through the deployment of Marines."" Our ruling Babeu said, ""The president has said the national security threat facing America, the top one, is global warming."" Obama continues to cite climate change as a great threat to the world, but framing the issue as the country’s top national security threat is an exaggeration. Obama has said fighting terrorism is his most urgent priority. The Arizona sheriff ignores important context, so we rate his claim as Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0cb68a01-985c-4db8-96bb-cc03740e77a6",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F26800>],/factchecks/2016/jun/04/paul-babeu/arizona-sheriff-says-obama-called-global-warming-a/
"['Labor', 'Iowa', 'Patty Judge']","
Patty Judge's collective bargaining claim rates Half True
","U.S. Senate candidate Patty Judge’s role in a 2008 veto of collective bargaining legislation has emerged as a key issue in Iowa’s Democratic primary, and the state’s largest unions have lined up against her campaign over her perceived unfriendliness to labor. At issue is House File 2645, a wide-ranging and controversial bill that expanded collective bargaining rights for public employees so that many more aspects of workers’ duties and work conditions could be negotiated. The measure flew through the Democrat-controlled House and Senate, going from introduction to passage in 11 days. But Gov. Chet Culver, a Democrat, vetoed the bill. Judge was Culver’s lieutenant governor. In his veto message, Culver criticized the manner in which HF 2645 was passed, calling it ""a poorly written bill with sometimes-ambiguous language that raises troubling, unanswered questions and unresolved uncertainties for management, labor and taxpayers alike."" In recent weeks the extent to which Judge and other Culver administration officials collaborated with lawmakers and labor leaders to improve the bill has been hotly debated. In an Iowa Public Television debate on May 26, Judge said she didn’t ""believe there was a lot of back and forth on that particular piece of legislation"" and said she ""wished we could have worked more closely with labor."" That led to a sharply worded retort from AFSCME Council 61, the state’s main public employees’ union: ""Patty Judge is not telling the truth about labor’s engagement with her administration during this process,"" AFSCME President Danny Homan said.  Then in a Des Moines Register/KCCI debate on Wednesday, Judge said she ""regretted"" how the bill was handled. ""I wish that we could go back and negotiate a good piece of legislation together,"" she said. ""But you know, we can’t. We can’t go backwards. We need to go forwards."" She followed that up by telling the Register that by the time the bill reached the governor, the opportunity for making constructive changes had passed. ""I regret that it had to be vetoed. That decision did not come lightly. There was a lot of thought, a lot of conversation that went into it,"" Judge said. ""But when a bill is sent to the governor’s office, there is no option for changing it. You sign it or you don’t sign it. While there was lots of conversation, there was really no opportunity for any sort of amending."" Did the governor’s office have no opportunity to change the bill in a meaningful way after it was passed? The history of HF 2645 provides the answer. The bill was introduced on March 14. On March 19, it was debated on the House floor, where it faced dozens of proposed amendments before ultimately passing on a 52-47 vote. It then went to the Senate, where it was considered on the floor on March 24. During a lengthy debate, more than 20 amendments were offered and rejected before the bill passed on a 27 to 23 vote. At that point, things slowed down. Rather than sending the bill directly to the governor’s office, Senate records show Majority Leader Michael Gronstal, D-Council Bluffs, filed a motion to reconsider. That parliamentary maneuver freezes legislation in place and allows lawmakers to reopen debate — including, potentially, amending or rewriting the bill and sending it to the other chamber for further discussion. The motion to reconsider held HF 2645 in place for more than a month — until April 25, when Gronstal withdrew it and began the process of sending the bill to Culver to be signed or vetoed. The bill reached Culver on May 5, and he vetoed it on May 15. Judge campaign manager Sam Roecker on Friday argued that the motion to reconsider didn't change the governor's office's ability to influence the bill.   ""She has addressed the issue of the 2008 legislation and has said clearly she regrets the circumstances around which it was vetoed,"" Roecker said in a statement. ""However, regardless of a motion to reconsider, the governor’s office does not have the power to introduce amendments to a bill before or after it’s passed by the legislature."" Our ruling Judge said there’s no option for changing or amending a bill after it’s ""sent to the governor’s office."" That’s true, but it overlooks the month-long period in which this particular collective bargaining legislation was held under a motion to reconsider after it was passed by lawmakers. If legislators, the governor’s office and other interested parties had found a new consensus on the bill’s language sometime within that March 24 to April 25 window, the bill could have been reconsidered by the Senate, amended, returned to the House and ultimately passed in the altered form. For this reason we rate Judge’s assertions that there was ""no option for changing"" the bill and ""no opportunity for any sort of amending"" Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F60940>],/factchecks/2016/jun/04/patty-judge/patty-judges-collective-bargaining-claim-half-true/

Georgia's David Perdue wrong saying more businesses closed in 2015 than opened
","Some Republicans might have misgivings about Donald Trump as the Republican nominee, but Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., isn’t one of them. Perdue told NBC News that Trump has what the country needs. ""We have the lowest worker participation rate since 1978,"" Perdue told host Chuck Todd on Meet the Press Daily on June 2. ""Poverty rate hasn’t changed. More businesses went out of business last year than were started for the first time in our history, Chuck. This is an economic fiscal policy that is failing, and I believe this guy (Trump) will absolutely set us in the right direction to change that."" We wanted to look at that statement about more businesses closing than opening last year. Perdue’s communications director Megan Whittemore sent us charts of business births and deaths posted by Gallup and the Brookings Institution, but neither had numbers beyond 2011. Whittemore said ""the trend is still downward of where it should be and that’s the point the senator is making."" But Perdue said the number of deaths exceeded the number of births, not that growth was lackluster or some variation of that theme. And the data after 2011 paint a different picture from what Perdue presented. The U.S. Census Bureau collects data on new businesses forming and businesses closing as part of a project called Business Dynamics Statistics. The Census data undercut Perdue’s claim in several ways. 1. The numbers only go back to 1977. Perdue said, ""More businesses went out of business last year than were started for the first time in our history."" No one has exact figures on what happened before 1977. But it is likely that in the depths of the Great Depression during the 1930s, more firms folded than were created. 2. The figures for ""last year"" --  2015 -- aren’t available. They’re not available for 2014, either. 3. The limited data does show a few years when more businesses were closing than opening, but not for the most recent years. In 1981, the country lost about 31,000 more businesses than were created. That trend reversed in 1982 and stayed that way until 2009. That year, and in 2010, more businesses closed than opened. That flipped again the following year. In 2011, the country saw a tiny gain of about  6,000 businesses. That was followed by net gains of about 40,000 in 2012 and nearly 70,000 in 2013 This chart based on the Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics shows the ebb and flow.   Ian Hathaway, a Brookings Institution non-resident senior fellow who has studied patterns of business openings and closings, said Perdue’s statement is incorrect. ""He is making a stale statement,"" Hathaway said. Our ruling Perdue said that last year the country saw more businesses closing than starting for the first time in the nation’s history. That’s wrong. Data doesn’t exist for last year. And the last year data is available, 2013, showed the opposite trend. Perdue’s historical claim also falls short. In 1981, there were more deaths than births. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097148FC0>],/factchecks/2016/jun/03/david-perdue/sen-perdue-uses-bad-history-business-birthdeath-tr/
"['Congress', 'Debates', 'Redistricting', 'North Carolina', 'Renee Ellmers']","
In North Carolina's 2nd District, a fight over residency and authenticity between Holding, Ellmers
","Rep. Renee Ellmers is attacking the authenticity of her main challenger for re-election in North Carolina’s 2nd District – a fellow member of the U.S. House of Representatives. ""You know, the congressman doesn’t live in District 2,"" Ellmers said of her rival in the Republican primary, Rep. George Holding, in a recent debate. ""I don’t want my family and friends to be represented by someone that doesn’t experience the same things that we are all experiencing. He can’t even vote for himself."" In a recent redrawing of district lines, Holding’s 13th District was moved halfway across the state. It now runs between Mooresville and Greensboro. Holding’s home was placed in the 4th District, a solidly Democratic district represented by longtime Rep. David Price. But a quirk of U.S. election law is that you don’t have to live in a congressional district to represent it. So Holding chose to run for neither his current district nor the one he will be living in, but for the 2nd District represented by Ellmers, who has been the target of attacks from some conservative groups for not always voting the party line. Ellmers is right that Holding doesn’t live in the district he wants to represent. But does that mean he ""doesn’t experience the same things that we are all experiencing""? The line implies he’s not familiar with the people who would be his constituents. And Ellmers doubled down, creating a website devoted entirely to the fact that Holding doesn’t live in the 2nd District. ""Do you think someone who does not live in the 2nd district, and does not understand the needs of the 2nd district should be representing it?"" the website asks, alongside a picture of Holding sleeping in Congress, from 2013. But Holding says he does understand the district, and we’re inclined to agree. In fact, the new 2nd District will contain far more people and places that Holding currently represents than Ellmers currently represents. ""You know, I’m born and raised in Wake County,"" Holding responded to Ellmers during the recent debate. ""Five generations of my family are from Wake County and Johnston County. When they redrew the district, they drew my neighborhood six miles out of the boundary. Hard for you to say I’m not part of this community."" Six miles is a relatively short distance for a district that stretches for about a two-hour drive from its southwest end in Johnsonville to its northeast extremes in Whitakers. We looked up Holding’s house in the Wake County property records and found that’s true – his swanky cul-du-sac near Raleigh’s Five Points neighborhood is less than six miles from the closest 2nd District homes in north Raleigh and seven miles from the boundary in south Raleigh. The current lines The 2nd district that Ellmers currently represents includes all of Moore County as well as parts of Alamance, Chatham, Cumberland, Harnett, Hoke, Lee, Randolph and Wake counties. She won both the 2012 and 2014 elections with those boundaries. But seven of those nine counties will not be in the new 2nd District. Harnett County and parts of Wake County will. On the other hand, Holding’s current district, the 13th, was largely the basis for the new 2nd. In addition to Harnett County and the Wake County suburbs, it will also include parts of Franklin, Johnston, Nash and Wilson counties. Holding currently represents many of the same parts of Franklin, Nash and Wilson counties. But his constituency also includes parts of Edgecombe, Granville, Vance and Wayne counties, which won’t be part of the new 2nd. Comparing old, new boundaries In terms of both population and geography, Holding currently represents a much larger proportion of what will be the new district. Yet for whomever is elected (unless Brannon pulls an upset), the challenges of this new district won’t be much different from the district he or she currently represents – trying to balance the needs of wealthier suburban constituents with more impoverished rural areas, where unemployment remains higher. The largest concentration of people in the new district will be the Wake County suburbs, which both incumbents currently represent parts of, although Holding has the lion's share. Areas of the other five counties – Harnett, Franklinm Johnston, Nash and Wilson – have some suburban growth as well but tend to be more rural and less wealthy as they get further away from the Triangle. The 2010 lines Even though Holding currently represents most of what will be the 2nd District, Ellmers is also familiar with the territory. Many of the areas that are now in the 13th and after November will be in the 2nd were also part of a previous version of the 2nd. Some of the voters who live in those areas elevated Ellmers to power in the first place in 2010, when she unseated incumbent Democrat Bob Etheridge. ""Many of the areas in the current ‘new map’ are areas that Congresswoman Ellmers was initially elected in during the 2010 election and areas that she served during her first term (2011-2013),"" wrote her chief of staff, Al Lytton, in an email. ""This included all of Franklin County, 2/3 of Nash County, all of Johnston County, all of Harnett County and portions of southern Wake County."" Three boundary changes in six years, with populations shifting back and forth and back again into different districts? Maybe there’s a reason so many people don’t know who represents them in Washington. Our ruling Ellmers said Holding doesn’t live in the 2nd District and thus doesn’t understand the experiences of its constituents. While he doesn’t live in the district, Holding does represent most of the people who will be in the new 2nd District. Some of the areas will be new to him, and he will lose some of his current constituents. But on the whole, if Holding wins the election, this district’s challenges and needs will be largely the same as his current district’s. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966CF940>],/factchecks/2016/jun/03/renee-ellmers/north-carolinas-2nd-district-fight-over-residency-/

Greg Abbott says Texas legislators last year passed fewest measures into law in 20 years
 ","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott recently celebrated the 2015 Texas legislative session, which ended last June, as the ""most conservative ever."" Abbott, rousing delegates to the Republican Party of Texas convention in Dallas, said in his May 2016 address: ""As just one example, we passed the fewest laws in 20 years, proving that better government doesn’t have to be more government."" Setting aside what this proves or not, we wondered if indeed the 2015 Legislature approved the fewest pieces of legislation since 1995, 10 regular biennial sessions before. This didn’t take long to confirm; the Texas Legislative Reference Library presents relevant bill statistics for every regular and special session since 1879. And according to the library’s compilation, the 1,280 Texas House and Senate bills that made it into law in 2015 were the fewest since 1,063 measures made it into law in 1995, the first year of Republican George W. Bush’s tenure. Over the two decades, the next-lowest count of bills passed into law was 1,334 in 2003, followed by 1,354 in 2011 and 1,369 in 2005, according to the library. A few earlier sessions had low law counts (though, of course, Abbott’s claim didn’t reach to these years). Those 140-day sessions occurred in 1983 (1,092 bills-into-law); 1985 (979 bills-into-law); 1989 (1,264 bills-into-law); 1991 (924 bills-into-law); and 1993 (1,050 bills-into-law), according to the library. For this check, we didn’t count other indicators of legislative activity such as proposed constitutional amendments, which lawmakers place before voters (without a governor’s say).

"['National', 'Military', 'Veterans', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Hillary Clinton attacks Donald Trump over his 'war hero' dig at John McCain
","Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of disrespecting veterans in a scathing speech, just days after Trump made headlines by giving $5.6 million in donations to 40 veterans groups. ""He says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese, and he has the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain aren’t heroes,"" Clinton said in her June 2, 2016, speech. In a separate fact-check, we rated the climate change claim Mostly True. Here, we’ll take on the claim about McCain. It dates back to a Trump an event in Ames, Iowa, on July 18, 2015. Trump, referring to McCain, R-Ariz., said ""he’s not a war hero."" McCain spent five and a half years in a Vietnamese prison camp. Trump’s comments were criticized by many of his then-competitors for the Republican presidential nomination. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, for example, said Trump was ""unfit"" to be commander-in-chief for his remarks — the very point Clinton aimed to make throughout her speech. Since then, Trump has claimed repeatedly that his statements were misinterpreted. We have looked at Trump’s statements before, but we wanted to re-examine the issue to see whether Clinton’s characterization of Trump’s words is accurate. The feud The bad blood between McCain and Trump started on July 16, 2015, when McCain said Trump had ""fired up the crazies"" at an Arizona anti-immigration rally. A few days later in Iowa, Trump fired back during an interview with Republican pollster Frank Luntz. Trump accused McCain of not doing enough for veterans and proceeded to call McCain a ""loser,"" at which point Luntz expressed incredulity, noting multiple times that McCain was a war hero. Here’s the back-and-forth: Luntz: ""He’s a war hero. He’s a war hero …"" Trump: ""He’s not a war hero ..."" Luntz: ""He’s a war hero."" Trump: ""He is a war hero ..."" Luntz: ""Five and half years in a Vietnamese prison camp …"" Trump: ""He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured. So he’s a war hero …"" Luntz: ""Do you agree with that?"" Trump: ""He’s a war hero, because he was captured, okay? I believe, perhaps, he’s a war hero. But right now he said some very bad things about a lot of people. So what I said is John McCain, I disagree with him that these people aren’t crazy."" Clinton would certainly be correct accusing Trump of saying McCain is not a war hero, which he does right off the bat. Trump does attempt to walk it back immediately, but he does so with caveats that continue to question McCain’s service -- suggesting he is only a war hero because he was captured -- and seemingly mock captured soldiers. Also, in a press conference immediately after the rally, Trump insisted he was not blaming McCain for being captured. On a radio show May 11, 2016, Trump also said McCain is a hero. ""You know frankly, I like John McCain, and John McCain is a hero,"" Trump said on the Imus in the Morning radio show. In an interview on the O’Reilly Factor on July 20, 2015, Trump told Bill O’Reilly that he would ""take back his remarks"" if there was a ""misunderstanding,"" adding that he has since corrected them to express what he meant. Clinton’s comments Clinton’s remarks can be interpreted in different ways. On the one hand, Trump did call McCain, a POW, ""not a hero,"" even if Trump has since distanced himself from that position. However, Clinton’s remarks have a broader interpretation as well — that Trump has made a general statement against POWs being heroes, with McCain as an example. That insinuation is present in what Trump said, as the Clinton press office and spokesman Zac Petkanas pointed out. ""I like people who weren’t captured, okay?"" Trump said at the initial Iowa rally. But Trump has repeatedly offered statements that support POWs more broadly. In the press conference immediately after the rally, Trump said that all prisoners are war heroes, with the exception of Bowe Bergdahl. ""If a person is captured, they’re a hero as far as I’m concerned, unless they are a traitor,"" Trump said. Trump also explained his comments about liking veterans who weren’t captured, saying that soldiers, both captured and not-captured, deserve credit. ""You have many people who didn’t get captured, I respect them greatly. You have many people who did get captured, I respect them greatly also,"" Trump said. Trump also pivoted back to his main talking point -- that McCain has failed to advocate for veterans in the Senate (a statement we have previously rated False). Our ruling Clinton accused Trump in a speech Thursday of having ""the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain aren’t heroes."" In one sense, she has a point. Trump did in fact say that John McCain is not a hero despite his POW record, although Trump has since taken those comments back and called McCain a hero. However, Clinton’s speech was intended to more broadly attack Trump’s national security credentials, yet Trump has never made the general statement that POWs are not heroes, even if his McCain-specific comments did insinuate it. In fact, he has insisted to the contrary on multiple occasions. We rate this statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ab56e161-1120-4a75-b37a-cb955b2cc526",[<zip object at 0x0000028097542600>],/factchecks/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-attacks-donald-trump-over-his-war-/
"['Nevada', 'Voting Record', 'Sharron Angle']","
Notwithstanding bunnies & Reagan, new Sharron Angle ad incorrectly links opponent with Democrats
","In a television ad invoking Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump and bunnies, repeat U.S. Senate candidate Sharron Angle is on the attack against her primary opponent and the race’s presumed frontrunner, Republican U.S. Rep. Joe Heck. After reading a Reagan quote about rabbits and tigers, Angle’s ad accuses Heck of aligning with Democrats a majority of the time. ""Congressman Joe Heck has been a D.C. rabbit for the past five years, voting 62 percent of the time with Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats on a variety of important issues,"" Angle says in the ad. The ad is certainly a provocative shot with Nevada’s primary election quickly approaching and Angle trailing in polls, so we were interested in seeing just how often Heck ended up on the same side as the House’s Democratic leader. Scoreboards Angle’s campaign referred to Heck’s 39 percent ""Liberty Score"" ranking on the Conservative Review website as support for the ad. The group calculates the score though 50 ""top"" votes through a rolling six-year window. The website hasn’t been Heck’s biggest fan, with the site’s editor-in-chief Mark Levin endorsing Angle and releasing a video saying he ""opposed conservative values on most issues of importance."" Heck’s campaign spokesman, Brian Baluta, didn’t comment on Conservative Review’s rating but called the ad ""absurd on its face."" So under that narrow set of criteria, Heck and Pelosi (with an 11 percent Liberty Score) appear to have relatively similar positions. However, Heck’s overall voting record is nowhere close to being as aligned to Pelosi as the ad suggests. A CQ Roll Call query shows Heck and Pelosi voting together roughly 31 percent of the time since the Republican entered Congress in 2011. The percentage is even worse for the most recent congressional session — the two only matched up on 25 percent of roll call votes. Other conservative-leaning groups tend to rank Heck somewhere in the middle of Republican House members, with ranking Pelosi much lower. Heritage Action Fund, which grades congressional members on conservative votes, bill co-sponsorships and other legislative activity, gives Heck a 53 percent rating and Pelosi a 16 percent rating. It’s a similar tale with Club for Growth’s legislative scorecard, which gives Heck a 58 percent lifetime score and Pelosi a measly 6 percent score. The American Conservative Union gives Heck a lifetime 64 percent ranking on their scorecard, while Pelosi has a lifetime 2.7 percent lifetime ranking over her congressional career. The ad also shows several rabbits with Heck’s face imposed, seeming to imply that Heck agrees with Pelosi on issues like gun control, Obamacare and amnesty for people not legally in the country. That’s also not the case, as a quick overview of Heck’s record plants him squarely in the Republican orthodoxy on many of the issues that Angle’s ad references. Gun control: Heck has a strong pro-gun record — he’s been endorsed by the National Rifle Association every time he’s run for office, and he voted in favor of the only gun-related legislation considered by the Conservative Review. Amnesty: Though it’s somewhat of a loaded term, Heck has publicly stated support for a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country. The Republican congressman has said he doesn’t agree with presidential candidate Donald Trump’s plan to deport the roughly 11 million people not legally in the country. Obamacare: Heck — a licensed physician — is generally opposed to the Affordable Care Act and has joined House Republicans in dozens of unsuccessful attempts to repeal all or part of the law. Conservative Review only considers four votes related to health care, including bipartisan legislation increasing Veteran’s Administration spending and an expansion of a grant program for veterinarians. Draft women: This claim is a bit more recent. Heck joined several Democrats in supporting a provision that would require women to begin registering with the Selective Service System for possible involuntary military service. The amendment was killed in a procedural maneuver in May, replaced with a requirement to study future potential needs for a broader military draft system. Our ruling An Angle ad claims Heck has voted 62 percent of the time with Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats on a variety of important issues."" Under the narrow parameters of the Conservative Review’s ""Liberty Score,"" Heck and Pelosi do appear to share similar policy priorities. But that only takes into account 50 votes over a six-year period. Other conservative groups with legislative scorecards show a much wider gap between the two, and a review of their cumulative voting records shows a much larger gap in votes. This claim is inaccurate. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cce12a3d-22d7-4490-a2a0-cd0b6bff89a4",[<zip object at 0x00000280973E8540>],/factchecks/2016/jun/03/sharron-angle/notwithstanding-bunnies-reagan-new-sharron-angle-a/
"['Science', 'PunditFact', 'Rush Limbaugh']","
Rush Limbaugh asks why Cincinnati Zoo gorilla hadn't evolved into a human
","A question for the ages: Why is a gorilla a gorilla, and not a human? Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh wondered aloud about primate evolution while discussing the case of a boy who fell into a gorilla enclosure at a Cincinnati zoo. Limbaugh said the zoo keepers did the right thing when they made the difficult but necessary choice to shoot and kill Harambe, a 400-pound male gorilla, to protect the toddler in the May 28 incident. But some animal activists are outraged at the death of a critically endangered animal. One dimension of this outrage, Limbaugh said, is people think they’re related to gorillas. ""A lot of people think that all of us used to be gorillas, and they're looking for the missing link out there,"" Limbaugh said. ""The evolution crowd. They think we were originally apes. I've always had a question: If we were the original apes, then how come Harambe is still an ape, and how come he didn't become one of us?"" Limbaugh has delivered mixed messages on his belief in evolution in the past. In 2004, he asked why chimpanzees and baboons ""got stuck being idiot gorillas"" instead of becoming humans. Then in 2010, he said, ""clearly things evolve,"" while still expressing skepticism about the progression of human and primate evolution.  We thought we’d take the opportunity to answer Limbaugh’s question and explain why the presence of gorillas doesn’t negate the concept of evolution. Humans are apes, as members of the taxonomic family hominidae, which also includes the great apes — orangutans, chimpanzees and gorillas. Humans, the great apes, monkeys and more are all primates.  However, humans didn’t evolve from gorillas or other apes, as Limbaugh suggests. Rather humans, gorillas and all other apes evolved from a common ape-like ancestor (now extinct) around 5 million to 8 million years ago. See the primate family tree to the left. Scientists know this from studying the comparative anatomy and DNA for humans and other creatures, said Blythe Williams, a professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University. ""Each species has changed over time,"" Williams said. ""For reasons that are not clear, our own species has changed in some very dramatic ways, such as becoming bipedal and getting really big brained."" Some experts believe this common ancestor was chimp-like, while others think it might have been different from anything currently living, said David Pilbeam, professor of human evolution at Harvard University. Williams said the question Limbaugh poses — why gorillas and humans coexist despite evolution — is akin to asking why Rush Limbaugh hasn’t evolved into his cousin, Stephen, or vice-versa. The two share a common ancestor, but they’re not the same person. ""They are different people, with some shared DNA,"" Williams said. ""But because of the introduction of other genes into their gene pool, via parents, they are not exactly the same as one another or their shared grandparent."" So it’s not that there was a linear progression from gorillas to humans, and some gorillas just didn’t evolve. It’s that over some 6 million years, descendants of a single, common species became gorillas, and others became humans. ""Evolution, including human evolution, doesn't have a goal beyond survival and reproduction,"" Pilbeam said, making the argument that becoming human isn’t the end-all-be-all in evolution. Homo sapiens are the only remaining human species, having emerged about 200,000 years ago, though there used to be numerous human species, including our closest extinct relative, the neanderthal. Certain genes differ just 1.8 percent between humans and gorillas. The difference in those genes is about 1.2 percent between humans and our closest animal relative, the chimpanzee. Our ruling Limbaugh said the presence of gorillas calls into question the concept of evolution. Limbaugh hit on a common misconception that humans evolved from modern-day apes. In reality, modern-day humans and modern-day gorillas are cousins, having both evolved from a common, but now extinct, ancestor. We rate Limbaugh’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b42f712a-3014-4819-ac8e-9e84151e6146",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3A3640>],/factchecks/2016/jun/03/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-asks-why-cincinnati-zoo-gorilla-hadn/

Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump cited Miss Universe pageant as evidence of foreign policy chops
","During a forceful, even mocking address on foreign policy, Hillary Clinton lit into some of Donald Trump’s past comments -- including one in which he recalled the time he held the Miss Universe pageant in Russia in 2013. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, ""says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia,"" Clinton said during her address on June 2, 2016. Is that correct? We found that the attack is pretty close to the mark, though somewhat overstated. Clinton’s barb stemmed from an interview Trump did with Fox News’ Bret Baier on May 6, 2016. At one point in the interview -- around the 16:40 mark here -- Baier asked Trump about whether he had ever met Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, which is an issue Trump had been coy about in previous interviews. Trump told Baier that once again he would have no comment on the question, in order to protect Putin’s confidences. Trump went on to say, however, ""I know Russia well. I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago, Miss Universe contest, which was a big, big, incredible event. An incredible success."" (Trump sold the pageant in 2015.) We won’t gauge whether experience putting on a beauty pageant can give someone important foreign-policy insights -- something Clinton was clearly skeptical of during her speech. But it is true that Trump mounted the event in Russia in 2013. (As Politico’s Michael Crowley reported, Trump ""watched 86 contestants don shimmering evening gowns and skimpy swimsuits for what he would call ‘the world’s biggest and most iconic beauty contest.’ "") So Clinton certainly has a point that Trump referenced his leadership of the Miss Universe pageant as a credential, and we didn’t notice any subsequent efforts by Trump to backtrack on what he said. However, Clinton overstated the case modestly when she accused Trump of claiming the pageant as ""foreign policy experience."" Trump definitely cited his pageant experience as evidence that he could work with Russia and Putin -- but the discussion with Baier never broadened out to foreign policy generally. Later in the exchange, for instance, he said that ""they (Russia) want to be friendly with the United States ... (but) they really dislike Obama."" So Trump didn’t say that the pageant helped him understand foreign policy overall. But he did say that it would help him get along with Russia. Our ruling Clinton said that Trump ""says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia."" Trump did cite that as evidence of how he could navigate a relationship with Russia and work with its president, Putin, but he didn’t go so far as to say it bolstered his foreign policy experience more generally.

Marco Rubio didn't say he hated the US Senate, but was definitely no fan
","Marco Rubio has yet to bow to pressure to reconsider his decision against seeking re-election to the U.S. Senate. But he is pushing back hard against the suggestion that he didn’t like his job in the upper house of Congress. ""Flashback to another article quoting a ‘longtime friend’ saying I ‘hate’ Senate. Words I have NEVER said to anyone,"" Rubio tweeted on May 16, 2016. The tweet linked to a Washington Post article put online on Oct. 25, 2015, that quoted an anonymous Floridian friend of Rubio’s as saying the gridlock in the Senate had worn out the freshman senator. ""He hates it,"" the source said. ""I don’t know that ‘hate’ is the right word,"" Rubio told the newspaper at the time. ""I’m frustrated."" Rubio described in the story the plodding pace of the Senate after he was elected in 2010. He said he was forced to ""slow-dance and wait"" for the Senate to gain a majority in 2012 and 2014 in order to accomplish anything. He said he was then told in 2015 that, ""We gotta wait to elect the president"" to get any bills passed. The story said that was when Rubio essentially gave up on being a senator. But was Rubio correct in tweeting months later that he had never said he hated the Senate? Obviously we can’t check what he may have said in private conversations, so we’ll have to take him at his word there. And we don’t know the name of the source quoted by the Post, so we can’t learn more about that context. But Rubio has made comments that showed he sometimes was less than thrilled about working on Capitol Hill. What Rubio did say Rubio’s disenchantment with the Senate looks to have started early — he told a newspaper he was stymied by his first year in office. Dec. 18, 2011, South Florida Sun Sentinel: ""I can't think of a single real high point. By and large, this has been a highly dysfunctional Congress, particularly in the Senate. It seems like the entire year has just been one big staged event, trying to get political advantage in the next election. You look at the major issues facing this country, and few if any of them have been confronted."" But it wasn’t until he announced in April 2015 he was running for president and faced criticism for missing a third of his votes that his feelings about the Senate became a subject of discussion. Billionaire Rubio donor Norman Braman, a South Florida auto dealer, told National Review in April 2015 that Rubio was ""frustrated with the fact that the Senate doesn’t do anything."" And Rubio said on several occasions that he sought the White House because the Senate was ineffectual. Sept. 16, 2015, GOP presidential debate in Simi Valley, Calif.: (Donald Trump said during the debate that Rubio had the ""worst voting record there is today,"" a statement we rated Mostly True.) ""I'm proud to serve in the United States Senate. … In my years in the Senate, I've figured out very quickly that the political establishment in Washington, D.C. in both political parties is completely out of touch with the lives of our people. … That's why I'm missing votes. Because I am leaving the Senate, I'm not running for re-election, and I'm running for president because I know this: unless we have the right president, we cannot make America fulfill its potential."" Sept. 17, 2015, Fox & Friends: ""I’ve never missed a vote where my vote would make a difference. ... So when there’s a vote that’s meaningful and serious, we are there doing our job."" Sept. 30, 2015, Hannity: ""Yes, I've worked in the Senate for four years, but I'm not of the Senate. I work in the Senate, I’m proud to represent Florida in the Senate. But let’s remember why I went there to begin with. I went to the U.S. Senate because I didn’t like the direction of this country, and I didn’t think either party was doing a good job in that regard. And that’s the same reason why I’m not running for re-election, and instead I’m running for president."" Oct. 6, 2015, Today: ""The majority of the job of being a senator is not walking on to the Senate floor and lifting your finger on a non-controversial issue and seeing which way you’re going to vote. The majority of the work of a senator is the constituent service to committee work, that continues forward unabated."" Oct. 7, 2015, New Hampshire TV interview: ""These votes that are happening in the Senate, we’re not going to be able to make a difference unless we have a new president, and a better president and that’s why I’m running for president."" Post-Post story The same day the Post article was put online, Rubio addressed his voting record on CNN. He said that Senate votes were effectively pointless. Oct. 25, 2015, State of the Union with Jake Tapper: ""I'm not missing votes because I'm on vacation. … I'm running for president so that the votes they take in the Senate are actually meaningful again. A lot of these votes won't mean anything. They're not going to pass, and even if they did, the President would veto it. "" The Post story and Rubio’s comments led to an outcry in Florida media, with several outlets criticizing Rubio for not fulfilling his legislative duties. The Sun Sentinel wrote a scathing editorial calling for Rubio to resign, leading to the subject coming up in a debate. At the Oct. 28, 2015, GOP debate in Boulder, Colo., CNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla asked Rubio about the editorial and whether he hated his job. Rubio only called the editorial ""evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today."" He said prior presidential candidates Barack Obama, John Kerry and Bob Graham all had missed many Senate votes while campaigning for president, a claim we rated True. The issue dogged Rubio through the rest of the campaign. At a Jan. 5, 2016, town hall in Iowa, Rubio again said senators were basically powerless. ""I have missed votes this year. You know why? Because while as a senator I can help shape the agenda. Only a president can set the agenda,"" he said. ""We’re not going to fix America with senators and congressmen."" He kept up his insistence that only a good executive can help in a Jan. 26 tweet of a campaign ad that said, ""Washington is broken and both parties are to blame."" Rubio dropped out of the race March 15 after coming in a distant second to Trump in Florida’s GOP primary. A month later, on April 14, Rubio excoriated the Senate in a floor speech for refusing to allow a vote on an amendment he introduced that would have curbed automatic welfare benefits for Cuban refugees. ""They’re saying we can't do it, and no one will tell you why we can't do it except some procedural internal Senate thing,"" Rubio said. ""This is ridiculous. This is why people are angry."" More recently, after insisting for months Trump would not be the Republican nominee for president, he has pledged support to the real estate mogul. Meanwhile, GOP leaders have started asking him to seek re-election to the Senate in an already crowded Republican field. Our ruling Rubio said he never told anyone he hated the U.S. Senate. Private conversations notwithstanding, we couldn’t find any evidence that he ever used the word ""hate"" (or any version of it) while discussing the Senate in a public forum. But it’s pretty clear Rubio harbored some disdain for the tedium of the political process, calling the Senate dysfunctional and votes meaningless. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate his statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3e1ff830-5626-4757-8ba8-c647b39c3557",[<zip object at 0x00000280966D5480>],/factchecks/2016/jun/03/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-didnt-say-he-hated-us-senate-was-defin/

Yes, Donald Trump did call climate change a Chinese hoax
","During her take-no-prisoners foreign policy speech on June 2, Hillary Clinton reminded listeners of controversial things that Republican presidential rival Donald Trump has said over the years. At one point, Clinton said, ""Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese."" Did he? Yes, though he later said it was a joke. The original source of this claim was a tweet Trump sent on Nov. 6, 2012, as we noted in a January 2016 fact-check of a similar claim by Clinton’s Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders. Trump’s tweet said, ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""  So Clinton certainly has evidence to support her claim. But we should also note that Trump backed off his claim after Sanders noted them in January on NBC’s Meet the Press, calling the Chinese link a ""joke."" On Jan. 18, after Sanders had attacked Trump’s climate change views in the Democratic debate, Trump told Fox & Friends, ""Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I'd be — received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn't care less. They have very — you know, their standards are nothing. But they — in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it's very hard on our business."" Trump may call the mention of China’s role a joke, but he certainly has a lengthy record of using the word ""hoax"" to describe climate change. (For the record, in 2014 we rated the claim that climate change is a ""hoax"" Pants on Fire.) On Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., ""Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and … a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, okay? It's a hoax, a lot of it."" That’s three times using ""hoax"" in one sentence. Trump has also used the word on Twitter since his 2012 tweet. On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, ""NBC News just called it the great freeze — coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?""  On Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: ""Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!""  That same day, he tweeted, ""Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.""  Trump also called climate change a ""hoax"" on the Jan. 6, 2014, edition of Fox & Friends. In addition, he said on the Sept. 24, 2015, edition of CNN’s New Day, ""I don’t believe in climate change."" And on Jan. 18, 2016, Trump said that climate change ""is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change."" We didn’t find Trump using the word ""hoax"" in the months since our previous fact-check, but he hasn’t backed off his aggressive skepticism of climate change and policies designed to alleviate it. In fact, he’s enshrined opposition to climate change efforts as a key part of his platform. In a high-profile speech on energy policy in North Dakota on May 26, 2016, Trump attacked ""draconian climate rules."" He advocated rescinding ""all the job-destroying Obama executive actions, including the Climate Action Plan"" and said he would ""cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs."" ""President Obama entered the United States into the Paris Climate Accords unilaterally and without the permission of Congress,"" Trump said. ""This agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use right here in America."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese."" Trump did tweet that view in 2012, though he made efforts earlier this year to describe that remark as a ""joke."" However, Trump has repeatedly called climate change a ""hoax"" in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn’t necessarily repeated the charge that China ""invented"" climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change ""is done for the benefit of China.""

Rating Katie McGinty’s curious campaign college claim
","Katie McGinty comes from a working class upbringing, as she routinely tells voters. The senate candidate was the ninth of 10 kids of a restaurant hostess and a police officer. She grew up in Rhawnhurst. She’s hosted numerous campaign events at diners. But what’s drawn the most scrutiny over the last few days are the statements she’s made about college. The third paragraph on the about page of McGinty’s website touts a claim we often hear about candidates from less privileged upbringings: ""She was the first in her family to go to a four-year college."" Keep an eye on that phrasing. Throughout her campaign, McGinty has returned to this theme. She was quoted by the AP in January saying, ""As the ninth of 10 kids and the first in my family to go to college, I’ve been privileged to live the American dream."" This week, McGinty’s account tweeted what appeared to be a comment from a college student saying ""Katie understands what I’m going through. She was the 1st in her family to go to a 4-year college & didn’t let anything hold her back.""   Then Buzzfeed revealed late Wednesday that one of McGinty’s older brothers had attended and graduated from LaSalle University nearly a decade before McGinty entered St. Joseph’s. The brother, John Patrick McGinty, Jr., first attended the Community College of Philadelphia and then graduated from La Salle in 1973 with a bachelor of arts degree, according to the 1973 commencement program. A spokesperson for La Salle confirmed to Billy Penn the university was a four-year college, and that to graduate from the university, one would have to attend the university. McGinty graduated from St. Joseph’s in 1985, according to a list of notable alumni from the university, and started there in 1981, according to her LinkedIn page.   Through campaign spokesperson Josh Levitt, brother John provided this statement: ""The way that Katie and our family have always talked about our experience is she was the first of the 10 McGinty kids to attend and graduate from a four-year college, straight out of high school. We were all really proud of that, just as we were proud that I earned my degree by completing a two-year program and then enrolling in La Salle.""   Our ruling U.S. Senate candidate Katie McGinty’s campaign website claims she was first person in her family to go to a four-year college. She’s elided this statement further through the course of her campaign. But documentation from La Salle, a four-year institution, shows her brother, John McGinty, graduated from the university in 1973 with a bachelor’s of arts, and the university confirmed to Buzzfeed he started attending the school in 1971. John took a different route to a four-year college by first attending Philadelphia Community College, so McGinty was the first in her family to attend *only* a four-year college directly out of high school. But the language used on McGinty’s website and at other times throughout her campaign doesn’t include this important distinction.

Dog meat: Regional treat or global health threat?
","Every June, the city of Yulin in China’s southwestern Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region hosts a spectacle that has drawn international condemnation.  An estimated 10,000 dogs are butchered as part of a dog meat festival that started about six years ago. U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., moved to put his colleagues on record against the practice. In a House resolution, he highlighted that ""dogs who reach the slaughterhouses are typically beaten to death with shocking brutality, without any regard for their welfare,"" and that the dog meat trade ""poses a risk to human health by exposing people to a multitude of diseases, including rabies and cholera."" Action is needed, the resolution continued, because the Dog Meat Festival in Yulin ""threatens global public health."" We are not insensitive to how ugly the scene might well be in Yulin. But our focus is on whether this festival in itself poses a threat to global public health. Hastings spokesman Evan Polisar sent us a statement that said ""anything that happens in China has global significance, positively or negatively, due to China's enormous size."" The statement noted that rabies kills about 2,000 people a year in China. People who handle the dogs are most at risk of contracting rabies by being bitten or scratched. ""Since rabies is deadly and the number in China is so big, a reduction of that number is a global accomplishment,"" Polisar told us in an email. The statement from Hastings’ office also mentioned the potential for food contamination at restaurants that serve dog meat. Perhaps, but that falls well short of describing a global health threat, officials at the World Health Organization told us. Put simply, you may reject the dog festival as being cruel to animals or unethical, but you shouldn’t suggest it poses a global health threat. ""While much can be said from the ethics and animal welfare points of view, we’re not aware of scientifically justified arguments behind the claim that a dog meat festival in China or the practice of eating dog meat represent a global threat to public health,"" said Dr. Kazuaki Miyagishima, director of WHO’s Department of Food Safety, Zoonoses and Foodborne Diseases. ""While it may pose a potential public health issue within China because of the lack of compliance with existing regulations, this would have no or very limited international impact."" Dog meat is eaten primarily in countries in Asia, although it is also reported in some places in Africa. This map shows the nations most commonly mentioned in news reports.  China did see a resurgence of rabies during the 1990s and the government responded with more monitoring and rabies vaccination programs. A study of about 1,300 cases found that six cases (.5 percent) were tied to the dog meat trade. Researchers in Yunnan Province on Guangxi’s western border took tissue samples from 300 dogs slaughtered for meat and found none were infected with rabies. Hastings’ resolution also mentioned cholera, but China reported no outbreaks of cholera in 2014 and while there was one between 2010 and 2013, it occurred far away in another part of China to the north and east of Yulin. We could find no survey of global health threats that made any reference to dog meat or the dog meat trade. Worldwide, rabies kills about 60,000 people a year, about a third of them in India. HIV/Aids and tuberculosis, clear global health threats, each kill over a million people annually. There are reports from China and Africa that dog slaughter is particularly cruel because some believe that the meat tastes sweeter if the animal dies in pain. The moral objections are obvious. The government of Yulin has distanced itself from the festival and moved to limit it. Our ruling Hastings said in his resolution that the dog meat festival in Yulin, China threatens global public health. No evidence backs that up. A leading expert at the World Health Organization dismissed the idea, both for the festival in particular, and the practice of eating dog meat in general. Peer-reviewed studies in China find little connection between the dog meat trade and rabies. There may be other reasons to condemn the festival, but the risk it poses to public health globally is not one of them.

Robin Vos takes aim at Chicago Bears quarterbacks and UW tenure policy
","It can be hard for Green Bay Packers fans to remember a time without consistency at the quarterback position. For the past 24 seasons, the Packers have had two primary quarterbacks — Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers. Combined, they have a total of 5 MVPs and two Super Bowl wins. One was just voted into the Hall of Fame, the other seems headed there. The Chicago Bears? Well, that’s a different story. They’ve had Jay Cutler in the spot since 2009, but that came after years of churning through quarterbacks. In a May 26, 2016 column published on the Right Wisconsin website, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, used the Bears’ quarterback situation to make a point about the University of Wisconsin System’s tenure policy. In his view, changes to relax the tenure system — ones harshly criticized by some faculty members — give the UW System more flexibility to deal with budget issues and other matters. In noting that under the old system, few faculty members with tenure ever lost their jobs, he invoked the Bears: ""The Chicago Bears have had more starting quarterbacks in the last 10 years than the total number of tenured faculty fired during the last two decades."" He also claimed under the former policy a tenured a tenured faculty member was less likely to get fired than someone is to hit a hole in one in golf. But we’re more familiar with quarterback turnovers, er, the quarterback turnover on the Bears. The analogy used by Vos may seem trite, but it gets at a central issue in the tenure debate — how secure faculty are in their positions. Is Vos right? What the details show Here’s the easy part, assuming you’re not a Bears fan. Since the 2006 season, the Chicago Bears have had nine different starting quarterbacks: Rex Grossman started 16 games in 2006, seven in 2007 and one in 2008; Brian Griese started six games in 2007; Kyle Orton started three games in 2007 and 15 in 2008 Jay Cutler started 16 games in 2009, 15 in 2010, 10 in 2011, 15 in 2012, 11 in 2013, 15 in 2014 and 15 in 2015; Todd Collins started one game in 2010; Caleb Hanie started four games in 2011; Josh McCown started two games in 2011 and five games in 2013; Jason Campbell started one game in 2012 and (The Green Bay Packers, by contrast, had a total of nine games started by quarterbacks other than Favre or Rodgers during the same period.) Now for the trickier part. Vos said the Bears had more starting quarterbacks in the past 10 years than the number of faculty members fired in the past two decades. Kit Beyer, Vos’ communications director, defined ""fired"" as ""dismissed for just cause."" Under UW’s tenure policy, tenured faculty members have always had the potential to be dismissed for just cause such as misconduct. (We rated Gov. Scott Walker’s claim that tenure at the UW amounts to a ""job for life"" Half True.) By this measure, a total of six faculty members were fired since 1996, according to both Beyer and data provided by the UW System. UW System spokesman Alex Hummel said this number is extremely low in large part because the ""weeding out process"" of employees happens both in the hiring stage and during the probationary years of employment before professors are granted tenure. At most institutions, 40% of professors are not granted tenure, he said. By the time faculty members are tenured, they have already been tested. ""Termination of tenured faculty anywhere you go in the United States is pretty rare,"" he said. Hummel also said a faculty member faced with the possibility of being fired might choose to resign instead, which would make the number lower than it would be if it included these cases. He did not have data on how many times this happened in the past 20 years. But Vos specifically used the word ""fired,"" which means faculty dismissed for just cause. That doesn’t include resignations. Our rating Vos said the Chicago Bears have had more starting quarterbacks in the past 10 years than the number of UW faculty members who have been fired in the past 20 years. Six faculty members have been fired in the past two decades, while there have been nine different starting quarterbacks for the Bears in the past decade.

"['Education', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says UW tenure policy used to promise ‘jobs for life’
","In Wisconsin, ""tenure"" has become a contentious word. In March, the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents made it easier for tenured professors to lose their jobs. The move spawned outrage among faculty members and put lawmakers who supported the changes on the defensive. While some faculty members dubbed the new policy ""#FakeTenure,"" Gov. Scott Walker framed  the changes as modest and necessary tweaks to give the system more flexibility to deal with tight budgets and changing student needs. On May 16, 2016, in an interview with conservative radio host Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM, Walker described recent no-confidence votes by faculty members aimed at the UW Regents and System President Ray Cross as overreactions. People were upset, Walker said, because the Regents ""had the audacity to put just a slight restraint on this ‘jobs-for-life’ tenure program that they have at the University of Wisconsin System."" Walker used the jobs-for-life phrase several times that week. It’s not an uncommon refrain. Supporters of university reform frequently characterize tenure as a ""job-for-life"" guarantee, a concept meant to sound absurd to workers outside of academia. While the concept of tenure dates to the Middle Ages, tenure as we know it was defined in 1940 and quickly became the widespread practice at colleges and universities. It was created to bolster academic freedom and to protect professors from being fired for expressing unpopular views or pursuing research considered controversial. But what about Walker’s claim? When it comes to the old UW tenure system, is he right about ""jobs for life""? How the program worked As evidence that UW faculty members had ""jobs for life"" under the former policy, Walker spokesman Tom Evenson pointed to the Board of Regents’ policy document on tenure. The statement defines tenure as an appointment of a faculty member ""for an unlimited period."" Evenson noted Merriam Webster defines ""unlimited"" as ""not limited in number or amount"" and added: ""The UW System’s use of ‘unlimited’ in this case is obviously in reference to the unlimited period under which one is employed under a tenure appointment."" Evenson also cited an opinion piece for the website Right Wisconsin written by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester. That piece said records obtained by Vos’ office from the UW System showed only six tenured faculty members were fired for just cause in the last 20 years. The UW System has 4,560 tenured faculty members, according to the article. That makes the odds of being let go very low — but not non-existent. Next, we asked a UW System spokesman about the system’s policies. Spokesman Alex Hummel acknowledged there have been few cases of faculty members being dismissed after attaining tenure, but said the word ""unlimited"" does not signify eternity. Rather, he said, it recognizes the lack of a specified limit. He also said the six-in-20-years statistic doesn’t account for situations in which faculty members, when faced with being fired, chose to resign instead. He didn’t have data on how many times this happened in the same time period. We also checked with the American Association of University Professors, which advised UW on its changes and whose model policies form the basis of tenure at institutions around the country. A spokeswoman said the UW System’s original policy aligned with the group’s model procedures, which say tenured appointments can be terminated for three reasons: just cause, such as misconduct; program discontinuations due to educational considerations; or financial emergencies that threaten the university’s existence. The changes in UW’s tenure policies expanded the criteria decision-makers use to determine if a program should be discontinued. In the past, if a program was discontinued, faculty members would have the option to be placed in another department. Under the new policy, decision-makers can consider — among other factors — if the program’s work is duplicated in another department, if student demand for the program has decreased or if the program is not cost-effective for the institution. In such cases, no new job is guaranteed and the decision is ultimately left to chancellors. Even before the change in Wisconsin, ""faculty members with tenure could lose their jobs in case of financial exigency,"" Laura Markwardt, a spokeswoman for the group, said in email. ""They could also be terminated for cause."" Thus, the old policy had grounds for dismissal, undermining Walker’s ""jobs for life"" claim. The fact it was rarely used does not mean it was not there. But we think the underlying point Walker was making is a valid one. As a practical matter, the extremely rare usage of the provisions can, in effect, make it a job for life. Our rating Walker described the UW System’s original policy as a ""‘jobs-for-life’ tenure program."" He left out the fact that even before the Board of Regents broadened the grounds for dismissal of tenured faculty members, individuals could be dismissed under several circumstances, such as misconduct and financial difficulties that threaten the university’s existence. But because dismissals under that policy were extremely rare, being granted tenure effectively promised someone a job for life. Our definition of Half True is ""the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2E4300>],/factchecks/2016/jun/03/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-uw-tenure-policy-used-promise-jo/

Keyser says Obama, Bennet want to 'give' Iran nukes -- but deal aims to prevent that
","In an attention-grabbing TV ad, Colorado Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jon Keyser accuses President Barack Obama and Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of wanting to give nuclear weapons to Iran. The ad opens with a narrator highlighting Keyser’s role as a military intelligence officer in Iraq, where he ""conducted capture and kill missions to remove high value targets in urban areas."" ""For us, Baghdad was the roughest. We weren’t fighting amateurs; we were fighting a vicious enemy armed by Iran,"" Keyser says. Then he pivots to the claim we’re fact-checking: ""Now Obama wants to give these guys nuclear weapons and Michael Bennet, he was all for it."" Keyser is among five Republicans vying to win the June 28 primary and the right to take on Bennet in the general election. He’s not the only Republican attacking a Democratic opponent this election season on the Iran deal, which the Obama administration and five other nations approved in 2015. Earlier this month, PolitiFact Florida issued a False rating when a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate said two Democratic opponents ""supported President Obama’s disastrous deal, which allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon."" Those Democrats did support the deal, but the intention was clearly not to allow Iran to produce a nuclear weapon. When we rechecked the terms for this fact-check, we found that was still the case. Keyser’s ad goes a step further to say Obama and Bennet want Iran to produce such a weapon. That incendiary characterization is also not true. We contacted the Keyser campaign. A spokesman did not provide evidence to back up the claim. The deal’s terms The deal, which was struck in July 2015, essentially lifts international economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for the nation agreeing to curb nuclear technologies and allowing nuclear-weapons inspections for 10 to 25 years. A sticking point for critics is that while Iran has to give up 97 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile and most of its centrifuges that could enrich more, that capability is not gone entirely. Iran can have a reduced number of operating centrifuges for 10 years, but research and development on advanced centrifuges will be limited. Uranium enrichment is supposed to be kept at levels unsuitable for weapons use for the next 15 years. Iran also can no longer produce plutonium, the other element that could create a bomb.   To make sure Iran is doing what it agreed to do, international inspectors will monitor known nuclear sites for those 15 years. They also can enter an undeclared site suspected of nuclear use, although Iran could take up to 24 days to allow inspectors into such sites. There’s been plenty of debate about how verifiable such activity can be. Surveillance of centrifuge production areas is slated to last 20 years, and uranium mills and mines will be monitored for 25 years. Iran also has to stick to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that it signed in 1974, thereby no longer pursuing nuclear weapons. It must follow further international treaties, as well. Theoretically, Iran must abide by those treaties for good, even after the 25-year inspection time limit passes. Several experts have told PolitiFact in recent months that as long as Iran adheres to the terms of the agreement, they cannot build a nuclear weapon. Some experts have said it’s reasonable to suspect Iran could disregard the agreement and again pursue a weapon. But even if the United States had won tougher terms, any agreement only works if the country follows the guidelines. Not coming to an agreement at all would have let Iran’s militarized nuclear progress continue unabated. A key mechanism of the agreement is that it lengthened Iran’s ""breakout time"" — how long it would take Iran to produce a nuclear weapon if it returned to building one. While some estimates put that time at two to three months before the deal, the breakout time is generally considered to be about a year under the terms of the deal. ""It does not have the uranium enrichment capacity to produce enough bomb-grade material,"" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, has told PolitiFact. ""It would take over a year. We would detect any attempt to do that within weeks, if not days."" Bennet was among a majority of Democrats who voted three times over 10 days in September to successfully block a Republican resolution to kill the Iran deal. According to the New York Times, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called multiple votes on the measure to reject the Iran accord. In part, he wanted to see if he could win a few votes needed to break the deadlock, the Times reported, but the votes also forced Democrats to repeatedly endorse a deal that they’d have to defend this election year.   In a statement after his vote, Bennet said, ""My conclusion is that the (Iran agreement) is more likely to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon than the plausible alternatives."" Bennet added that the deal ""has flaws,"" and he has co-sponsored legislation to ""clarify better how we will respond if Iran cheats on this deal."" The legislation, which remains in committee, seeks to create a ""strategy with our partners to ensure that Iran appreciates the consequences of its violations, for the next 15 years and beyond,"" he said in a separate statement. Our ruling Keyser said, ""Obama wants to give these guys nuclear weapons and Michael Bennet, he was all for it."" Keyser portrays the agreement as a plot to arm Iran with nukes when it’s designed to do exactly the opposite. The terms of the deal forbid Iran from pursuing a militarized nuclear program. There are limits on uranium enrichment and facility uses, and Iran must allow inspections. It also must abide by terms of international treaties to not seek weapons even after the deal’s guidelines end. To develop nuclear weapons, Iran would have to either break the terms of the agreement or else wait it out and start building one anew once the deal’s provisions have expired (which would be counter to the provisions of treaties that predated this deal). It's ridiculous to say Obama and Bennet wanted this deal because they want to give Iran a nuclear weapon. We rate the statement Pants on Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c9edf88f-91bb-450c-82cf-14dacd88c0e3",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A4C8C0>],/factchecks/2016/jun/02/jon-keyser/keyser-says-obama-bennet-want-give-iran-nukes-deal/

Donald Trump wrong in accusing Hillary Clinton of lying about his views on a nuclear-armed Japan
","On the eve of a high-profile foreign-policy speech by Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump accused his rival of lying about what he’d said about Japan and nuclear weapons. At a rally in Sacramento on June 1, 2016, Trump said that Clinton has spoken ""such lies about my foreign policy. They said I want Japan to nuke, that I want Japan to get nuclear weapons. Give me a break."" (The excerpt is around the 11:40 mark here.) Trump had made a similar claim during a rally in San Diego, when he said Clinton ""was saying that I want Japan to arm with nuclear weapons. I never said that."" So who’s right? For the most part, Clinton is. (Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to an inquiry for this article.) Trump has been open to the idea of more nukes Clinton has periodically lobbed a charge along these lines. ""A lot of what we’re hearing is not reassuring,"" she said in Rochester, N.Y., in April. ""It is a kind of amateur hour, where they say whatever pops into their minds. Let’s pull out of NATO. Let’s let Japan and South Korea develop nuclear weapons."" Her evidence includes interviews and comments Trump has made on the campaign trail. When Trump sat for a March 26 interview with the New York Times, he was asked directly, ""Would you object if (Japan) got their own nuclear arsenal, given the threat that they face from North Korea and China?"" Trump responded in part, ""There’ll be a point at which we’re just not going to be able to do it anymore. Now, does that mean nuclear? It could mean nuclear. It’s a very scary nuclear world. Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation. At the same time, you know, we’re a country that doesn’t have money."" Let’s set aside Trump’s internal inconsistency -- saying that Japan might need nuclear weapons, and then, just seconds later, saying that the world’s ""biggest problem"" is nuclear proliferation. If you read his words closely, Trump didn’t quite say he wants Japan to get nuclear weapons, but he did go right up to the line. He was leaving the option on the table. Having seen Trump’s comments to the New York Times, CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked him about it in a CNN town hall in Milwaukee on March 29. Answering Cooper’s question about breaking with Japan’s non-nuclear stance, Trump said, ""At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea."" In fact, during the town hall, Cooper gave Trump multiple opportunities to back off his suggestion that Japan may need nuclear weapons, but Trump never did. He said, in succession, ""maybe it's going to have to be time to change,"" ""at some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off,"" ""it's going to happen, anyway,"" and ""wouldn't you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons?"" That may not fit the strict definition of advocating, but again, it’s very close. Finally, Trump said something similar on the April 3 edition of Fox News Sunday, when host Chris Wallace pressed Trump on his past comments. After Wallace asked whether Trump wanted to see a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula, Trump said, ""It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea."" Wallace interjected, ""With nukes?"" Trump responded, ""Maybe they would be better off -- including with nukes, yes, including with nukes."" How unusual this position is We asked nuclear policy experts whether Trump’s stated position -- not specifically advocating that Japan get nuclear weapons, but saying he would be open to it -- was an unusual view, as Clinton suggested. They said it was. ""The prevailing, bipartisan and fairly settled academic judgment has been that the risk of loose nukes or accidental nuclear war means that every additional nuclear weapon is a potential cataclysm waiting to happen,"" said Richard Nephew, a fellow with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. ""I'm not aware of anyone that I'd deem to be a serious policy proponent or thinker who has seriously advocated this in a while."" The last major figure Nephew could think of is Kenneth Waltz, an international relations scholar who articulated a ""realist"" view -- discussed in this 1981 paper -- that said the wide spread of nuclear weapons would create such risks to using them that no country ever would. However, ""by the 1960s, most folks had decided that was a horrible idea,"" Nephew said. ""You'd be hard pressed to find anyone saying that since the end of the Cold War."" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, agreed. The statements were so out of the mainstream that ""our allies in Japan and the rest of Asia are already alarmed by those statements. Mr. Trump’s suggestion that a nuclear-armed Japan would make the United States or Japan safer is radical and highly dangerous, and is without precedent for a major party presidential nominee."" Our ruling Trump said Clinton has spoken ""such lies about my foreign policy. They said I want Japan to nuke, that I want Japan to get nuclear weapons. Give me a break.""  Trump didn’t literally say he wants Japan to go nuclear. But he came just about as close as someone can without saying those specific words -- certainly enough to undermine his flip dismissal, ""Give me a break."" On more than one occasion, Trump publicly said that Japan, and the United States, might be better off if Japan had nuclear weapons, and he declined multiple attempts by interviewers to backtrack from that view. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/95bd454f-b3ca-4291-b0ee-86d46e0e9dc6",[<zip object at 0x000002809738FF40>],/factchecks/2016/jun/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-accusing-hillary-clinton-lying-/
