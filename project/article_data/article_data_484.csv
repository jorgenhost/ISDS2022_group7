Ohio Republican Mike DeWine changed position on Medicaid expansion
","Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, the Republican running for governor, announced July 11 that he supports keeping Medicaid expansion, leading Democrats to accuse him of flip-flopping. ""The DeWine-Husted Administration will need to keep extended Medicaid coverage for adults,"" DeWine said during a press conference where the Ohio State Medical Association PAC endorsed his campaign. ""We will also reform the program. This is consistent with what we have been saying."" DeWine’s Democratic rival Richard Cordray pushed back on DeWine’s statement that he had been consistent on Medicaid expansion. ""This is such an enormous flip-flop that it's more likely a belly flop!"" Cordray tweeted. About 700,000 Ohioans have Medicaid due to the expansion under the Affordable Care Act. We will examine DeWine’s statements on our Flip-O-Meter, which measures if politicians’ have flip-flopped and to what extent. Some voters see flip-flops as a sign of hypocrisy while others may view them as a politician evolving on an issue. We found that for years DeWine has opposed the Affordable Care Act, which included Medicaid expansion. At times he has been vague when pressed to give a yes-or-no answer on Medicaid expansion, and he’s repeated a talking point that he wanted to reform the program. In July, he came out in support of the expansion. On DeWine’s first day in office as attorney general in 2011, he authorized Ohio to join the multistate lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. His statement called the law a ""huge federal overreach"" and criticized the individual mandate. The lawsuit challenged a few core provisions of the law, including Medicaid expansion, which came with an implied threat that the government would withhold funding unless states complied. When DeWine spelled out what he thought were the sins of the law in an op-ed in the Washington Times in 2012, he included Medicaid expansion, although Ohio had not yet signed on to expansion. ""Obamacare is, quite simply, the federal version of Romneycare,"" DeWine wrote the day after the lawsuit was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. ""All of the problems that we have seen unfold in Massachusetts -- doctor shortages, Medicaid expansion and escalating health insurance costs -- are already starting to take place across the country as Obamacare is implemented."" The Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate and ruled that states would have a choice about expanding Medicaid. The next year, Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich expanded Medicaid. In 2017, DeWine refused to take sides in the battle between Kasich and the GOP-controlled General Assembly about expansion. When DeWine launched his campaign for governor in June 2017, he was asked at a forum if he would end Medicaid expansion. ""I’m against Obamacare; this is part of Obamacare,"" he said. In June 2017 DeWine said in a TV interview that the Medicaid expansion ""has done a lot of good for people who do have an addiction."" DeWine said that ""smart sheriffs"" are helping inmates enroll in Medicaid when they leave jail. ""We don’t want that to go away,"" he said. During the primary, DeWine avoided giving a yes-or-no answer to whether he would maintain Medicaid expansion although he said that it was ""financially unsustainable."" His talking point was that he would pursue a ""third way,"" which included seeking a waiver from the federal government to change the program. Ohio already has a pending waiver with the federal government to add work requirements. On July 11, the Ohio State Medical Association announced that DeWine had gained it's backing in part because he agreed to keep the Medicaid expansion. At the press conference, DeWine emphasized that he wanted drug addicts to continue getting treatment through Medicaid expansion. He vowed to ""keep extended Medicaid coverage for adults"" as well as to reform the program to encourage able-bodied adults to work. DeWine said that ""there is no change"" to his Medicaid policy. ""What we said all along is it had to be reformed,"" he said. When DeWine came out in support of Medicaid expansion, his critics accused him of flip-flopping. For years, DeWine has opposed the Affordable Care Act, which included Medicaid expansion. DeWine's position has evolved, though. During the primary he said that the program was financially unsustainable and needed reform, but he's also said that Medicaid expansion helped drug addicts pay for treatment. On July 11, DeWine announced that he would keep Medicaid expansion. The change of positions has happened over the course of several years, but it is a distinct change. We rate this a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2018/jul/20/mike-dewine/ohio-republican-mike-dewine-changed-medicaid/

Challenger Leah Vukmir cites 22-year-old vote in attack on Tammy Baldwin over pledge, flag anthem
","Is U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin opposed to schools displaying the American flag and having students say the Pledge of Allegiance and sing the national anthem in school? That’s a heavy-hitting claim from state Sen. Leah Vukmir of suburban Milwaukee, one of two major Republican candidates competing to face Baldwin in November 2018. The claim came in a June 1, 2018, tweet: ""It’s clear Sen. Baldwin lacks pride in her country. She boldly opposed displaying the flag and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance or singing the National Anthem in our classrooms."" Vukmir repeated the statement on her campaign website and during a July 6, 2018, interview on The Jay Weber Show on WISN-AM: ""If you go back and look at some of the things she supported when she was in the Wisconsin Legislature, it’s embarrassing – boldly opposing displaying the flag and reciting the Pledge or singing the national anthem in our classrooms…"" Is Vukmir right about Baldwin’s position on flag display, the pledge and national anthem in schools? In the end, Vukmir’s claim comes down to one vote from 22 years ago, ignoring other votes that Baldwin could pull out and cite as evidence of patriotism. Let’s take a look. The bill Included in Vukmir’s tweet was a link to the Assembly Journal for March 1996, which included a vote on Assembly Bill 667. Baldwin was elected to the chamber in 1993. The bill aimed to change some of the requirements around displaying the American flag, reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and singing the national anthem in schools. They were as follows: In public and private schools, flags would have to be displayed in every classroom during school hours. At the time, schools had the option to display it on a flagstaff on school grounds or in the classroom. Public and private schools would have to offer the Pledge of Allegiance or the national anthem for grades 1 to 12 at the beginning of each school day. At the time, schools were required to offer the pledge to grades 1 to 8 once a week. A statement was also included saying if students or their parents objected, students couldn’t be forced to say the pledge or sing the anthem. So, the measure would have expanded requirements related to the pledge, flag and anthem that were on the books. It would not have created them, as Vukmir’s claim suggests. In the end, Baldwin was one of two Assembly members to vote against the bill. We could not locate any news articles from the time that included comments on why she voted against the measure. The Wisconsin State Journal did not have any record of coverage in its archives either. And Baldwin campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt refused to comment on why Baldwin voted against the bill. In any case, Assembly Bill 667 died in the Senate. But language changing the grade levels where the pledge and national anthem had to be offered was later added to a budget bill, which passed in August 2001. By then Baldwin was in the U.S. House of Representatives. When asked for evidence to back up the claim, Mattias Gugel, communications director for Vukmir’s campaign, pointed to the vote and basically repeated the words from the tweet. Gugel also emailed a statement from Vukmir: ""This isn’t a belief of my campaign – it’s Baldwin’s voting record."" Baldwin’s response The claim we’re examining is about a specific vote, and whether Vukmir characterized it correctly. However, it came in the context of a broad attack on Baldwin’s patriotism. Neidhardt, Baldwin’s campaign spokesman, said the attack was ""despicable"" and noted that Baldwin -- like other senators -- took an oath to uphold the Constitution when sworn into office. ""Wisconsinites know that Tammy Baldwin is a dedicated leader who stands up for our country and its values every day, whether it's defending the display of the American flag, protecting the Pledge of Allegiance, or championing Buy American laws,"" Neidhardt said. He also cited three pieces of legislation Baldwin voted on related to the flag and pledge: In 2005, Baldwin voted in favor of Resolution 245, which urged the U.S. Supreme Court to ""speedily find the use of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools to be consistent with the Constitution of the United States,"" citing two U.S. Court of Appeals rulings that were split on the issue. That same year, Baldwin supported the Freedom to Display the American Flag Act of 2005, which prevented condominium, cooperative, or residential real estate management associations from restricting members from displaying the American flag. In 2002, Baldwin voted in favor of a bill to reaffirm the phrase ""one Nation under God"" in the Pledge of Allegiance in 2002. Our rating Vukmir said Baldwin ""opposed displaying the flag and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance or singing the National Anthem in our classrooms."" She cited a Baldwin vote from more than 20 years ago. While the vote happened, the claim is  presented in a way that ignores Baldwin’s other votes supportive of the flag and pledge. She portrayed the bill Baldwin voted against as one that would get rid of displaying the flag and offering the anthem and pledge in schools, when it was about changing specific requirements around them. We rate her claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/jul/20/leah-vukmir/sen-tammy-baldwins-patriotism-questioned-challenge/
"['Immigration', 'California', 'Kamala Harris']","
TRUE: 'Nearly 2,600 children' remained separated from parents as of mid-July
","California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris has condemned President Donald Trump on numerous occasions. Recently, she called out Trump for not standing up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Not long ago, she denounced his administration’s handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. But Harris, who has been mentioned as a potential 2020 presidential candidate, has saved some of her sharpest criticism for Trump’s policy that separated thousands of migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border this spring. ""Every single day these families are separated, another child goes to sleep terrified because they don’t know where their parents are,"" Harris wrote in a recent Facebook post. ""All because of a policy used to punish immigrants fleeing violence. This is not reflective of a civil society."" In a different post, she wrote that ""these children are in prison."" This week, Harris and two other Democratic senators introduced the Reunite Act during a press conference at the U.S. Capitol. The bill would require the immediate reunification of families along with access to legal counsel and child advocates for those who have been separated. She said the legislation is necessary to reunify the many children still separated. ""Let’s talk about the facts and where we are today: There are still nearly 2,600 children who are separated from their parents,"" Harris said on July 17. The separations stem from Trump’s ""zero-tolerance"" policy calling for the prosecution of all immigrants who illegally crossed into the United States at the southwest border. Attorney General Jeff Sessions officially announced the policy April 6 as a deterrent to illegal immigration. Trump signed an executive order to end family separations on June 20 after a backlash against that part of his policy. We wanted to know, weeks after the Trump administration ended that policy, did Harris get her numbers right on how many children remain separated? We set out on a fact check.  In this June 1, 2018, file photo, children hold signs during a demonstration against the Trump administration's family separation policy in front of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices in Miramar, Fla. Wilfredo Lee / AP Photo Our research When asked for evidence, Harris’ spokesman pointed to testimony in a July 13 court filing from Chris Meekins, the deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. Meekins testified that 2,551 separated children ages five and up remained in the agency’s custody. Politico reported it was the first time the Trump administration had specified the exact number of separated children. It added the ""health department earlier had estimated only that ‘under 3,000 children’ were separated from their parents."" One week ago, HHS reported it had reunited 57 of 103 children under the age of five with their parents. Adding those remaining young children, 46 as of last week, with the 2,551 children ages five and up, fits with Harris’ statement that ""nearly 2,600"" children remained separated as of mid-July. The Trump administration said late last week it would speed up the reunification process. But it’s not clear whether that’s resulted in a major change this week. An HHS spokeswoman on July 19 said she could not immediately provide a current figure for the total number of children that remain separated. A press release on the agency’s website says HHS and other federal agencies are ""working rapidly"" to reunify eligible children with their parents under the orders of a U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw of San Diego. HHS is facing a July 26 court-ordered deadline to reunify all the children. Not all children will be reunified In a family reunification report issued this week, HHS said the 2,551 figure ""represents the total possible 5-and-up cohort of minors who could be subject to the court order. Based on past experience, it is likely to include a significant number of minors who are not eligible for reunification under the court’s order. Not all of the 2,551 minors in HHS care will necessarily be reunified, because some adults claiming parentage may not actually be the parents or may be unfit or a danger to the children."" Our rating Sen. Kamala Harris claimed there ""are still nearly 2,600 children who are separated from their parents,"" speaking on July 17. A Trump administration official testified four days earlier that 2,551 children ages 5 and up remained separated. That figure along with the 46 youngest children that the administration said remained separated as of mid July equates to ""nearly 2,600."" A spokeswoman for the U.S. Health and Human Services Department could not provide a current total this week for the number of remaining separated children. Still, Harris appears to have accurately described the total based on the publicly available information at the time of her statement. We rate her claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. UPDATE: After we published on July 19, 2018, and two days after Harris' statement, the Trump administration updated its figures, saying 364 of 2,551 children age five and older had been reunified with their parents, according to news reports.

Misleading headline connects Clinton, Abedin to New York woman's death
","A misleading headline purporting to link Hillary Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin to a mysterious New York death has blown a small connection way out of proportion. ""Hillary in hiding as police discover dead body hidden in Huma Abedin’s dumpster,"" said a July 12, 2018, headline from Mad World News, a conservative website that has peddled falsehoods before. This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ""Another dead body has turned up in connection to Hillary Clinton,"" the story said. ""This time, the remains of a woman were found in a dumpster at Huma Abedin’s New York apartment. Hillary has gone into hiding as Huma’s neighbors told the cops they believe the death has something to do with Anthony Weiner’s recent conviction."" Authorities did find a woman dead in the trash compartment of a New York apartment building on July 10, 2018. But allegations implicating Clinton or Abedin in the incident are uncorroborated. Let’s take a look at what actually happened, according to credible reports detailing the tragedy. On July 10, police responded to Zeckendorf Towers, an upscale apartment complex in New York. There, they ""discovered a 48-year-old female unconscious and unresponsive inside a trash compactor,"" police told the New York Post. The woman, who was later identified as building resident Lara Prychenko, was found by a maintenance worker. Surveillance video later showed her in a nearby elevator moments earlier, where she left her handbag before entering the hallway. Police later told reporters they believed she may have fallen down the chute while drunk. Abedin and her ex-husband, imprisoned former congressman Anthony Weiner, previously owned an apartment in the same complex. The former couple reportedly owned the apartment for multiple years, but listed it for rent on March 19, 2017, the same day Weiner pleaded guilty for explicit texts to a minor and Abedin filed for divorce. The listing was taken off the market days later, though it is not clear whether the apartment was sold or taken off the market for another reason. Most news outlets referred to the building as a place that Abedin ""used to call home."" Regardless, the trash compactor where the dead woman was found was commonly shared. It was not ""Abedin’s dumpster,"" despite what the Mad World News story said. Further, apartment residents did not tell cops and NBC ""they believe the death has something to do with Anthony Weiner’s recent conviction."" According to the NBC report cited in the Mad World News story, the neighbors actually ""said they initially thought the police presence had something to do with the building's famous resident, Anthony Weiner."" Clinton, for her part, has not actually gone into hiding. She has been active criticizing President Donald Trump and promoting her upcoming events on Twitter and Facebook. Three days after the body was discovered, she addressed a teachers union conference in Pittsburgh. She is also set to attend a festival in New York on July 21, 2018, according to her Twitter. The New York Police Department did not respond to a request for comment. A headline said, ""Hillary in hiding as police discover dead body hidden in Huma Abedin’s dumpster."" A dead body turned up in the trash compactor at the same apartment building that Abedin used to call home, but we could not find any evidence that Abedin and Clinton played any role in the incident or were implicated in the police investigation.

"['Candidate Biography', 'History', 'Florida', 'Ron DeSantis']","
Was John Brennan once a member of the Communist Party?
","Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis cast doubt on the credibility of John Brennan over the former former CIA director’s furious reaction to President Donald Trump’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Brennan called Trump’s meeting with Putin ""nothing short of treasonous"" on Twitter. Donald Trump’s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of “high crimes & misdemeanors.” It was nothing short of treasonous. Not only were Trump’s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you??? DeSantis, who is vying for Florida governor, appeared on Fox News hours later to respond. ""John Brennan was a disaster as CIA director,"" DeSantis said on Fox News on July 16. ""He was a disaster as the counterterrorism official. He was a member of the Communist Party during the Cold War."" DeSantis added: ""So this is not exactly the guy I would listen to about Russia."" We wanted to look into his statement that Brennan was a member of the Communist Party during the Cold War. We found Brennan has acknowledged voting for a communist presidential candidate in 1976. That does not mean he was a member of the Communist Party. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and pundit Sebastian Gorka are examples of Republicans who framed similar criticism of Brennan more accurately, singling out the vote but not going as far as saying he belonged to the party itself. Long before his appointment as CIA director in 2013, Brennan took a required polygraph test before entering the agency. Brennan discussed the test at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's annual conference in September 2016, CNN reported. He was a panelist in a discussion about diversity in the intelligence community. Brennan was asked about whether past activism would create a barrier for diverse candidates seeking to enter the intelligence community later in life. According to Brennan, the polygrapher asked him, ""Have you ever worked with or for a group that was dedicated to overthrowing the U.S.?"" Brennan said he was apprehensive — he had voted for Gus Hall for president in 1976, which was while the Cold War was underway. (The Cold War is generally defined as running from 1947 to 1991.) The New York Times reported Hall earned more support from American voters in his 1976 presidential campaign than in his other three. He won 58,992 votes, putting him in eighth place, behind candidates from the Democratic, Republican, Independent, Libertarian, American Independent, American and Socialist Workers parties. ""I froze, because I was getting so close to coming into CIA and said, 'OK, here's the choice, John. You can deny that, and the machine is probably going to go, you know, wacko, or I can acknowledge it and see what happens,'"" CNN has quoted Brennan as saying. (We searched for video but did not find it.) Brennan told the polygraph operator that he had voted for Hall, but added that he was never a member of the Communist Party. Speaking at the conference, Brennan said he was relieved to have been accepted into the CIA, because he worried about having compromised his chances by being forthcoming. ""I said I was neither Democratic or Republican, but it was my way, as I was going to college, of signaling my unhappiness with the system, and the need for change. I said I'm not a member of the Communist Party, so the polygrapher looked at me and said, 'OK,' and when I was finished with the polygraph and I left and said, 'Well, I'm screwed.'"" Brennan used the anecdote to make a point about room for diversity in the CIA ranks. ""So if back in 1980, John Brennan was allowed to say, 'I voted for the Communist Party with Gus Hall' ... and still got through, rest assured that your rights and your expressions and your freedom of speech as Americans is something that's not going to be disqualifying of you as you pursue a career in government,"" CNN reported him as saying. Does any of this make Brennan a member of the Communist Party at the time? No. In 1976, Brennan was studying political science at Fordham University. This was the first election after the Watergate scandal, which left many Americans disillusioned with American politics. He could have voted for the Republican candidate Gerald Ford, who had controversially pardoned Richard Nixon, or he could have cast his ballot for Democratic candidate Jimmy Carter. Stephen Craig, a political science professor at the University of Florida, said, ""Carter (was) a southerner who was not trusted given the legacy of the Jim Crow South by many Democrats and other left-leaning voters."" ""Carter was an outsider who promised ethical governance but still represented mainstream politics,"" added Gregory Koger, a political science professor at the University of Miami. Importantly, experts agree that voting for a particular candidate in a party does not make the voter a member of that party. Becoming a member of a party is a much more specific and intensive commitment than simply pulling a lever in the ballot booth. ""Brennan was … a young idealistic student pursuing studies in politics who shared the concerns of many about the health of the U.S. political system during this time period,"" said Thomas Sutton, a political science professor at Baldwin Wallace University. Brennan’s former CIA deputy chief of staff Nick Shapiro told PolitiFact Florida that it wouldn’t make sense for someone who was a secret communist to out themselves repeatedly. DeSantis said Brennan ""was a member of the Communist Party during the Cold War."" Brennan has openly confirmed voting for a Communist Party candidate for president in 1976. But the DeSantis campaign did not provide evidence that he was a card-carrying party member, and we did not find any. Voting for a particular candidate in a party does not make the voter a member of that party. Because it contains an element of truth but twists facts to give a different impression, we rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/jul/19/ron-desantis/was-john-brennan-once-member-communist-party/

Misleading story links San Juan mayor to hurricane relief fraud
","A headline on an online story says, ""Puerto Rico mayor facing fraud charges over $3M in federal disaster relief."" The article includes a photo of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, wearing a shirt with ""NASTY"" printed in large block letters. This photo is taken from a television appearance following Hurricane Maria, which struck Puerto Rico in September 2017. Cruz was a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, accusing him of providing insufficient aid to the island. On Facebook, the story's link preview shows Cruz’s face above the headline. But she has not been accused of fraud related to hurricane relief. The article, published July 15 on Your News Wire, reveals that Cruz isn’t facing charges at all. A different Puerto Rican mayor was accused. (Fact-checkers at The Weekly Standard caught that the initial version of the story said that Cruz and her party faced charges, but the language had been changed by the time we looked at it. Some versions of the story copied elsewhere had not made the change.) We decided to dig a little deeper and see what else might be misleading about this story. The mayor facing fraud charges is Miguel Ortiz-Vélez of Sabana Grande. Federal authorities have accused him of running a three-year scheme, beginning in 2013 and ending in 2016, to defraud the government of $3 million. Ortiz-Vélez proposed projects to the Puerto Rico Department of Education, but intentionally overestimated their cost. He gave the extra money to the companies he contracted out for the work, as well as to the city. The owner of one of the companies reimbursed Ortiz-Vélez nearly $23,000 in cash. Ortiz-Vélez was indicted on July 2 for theft of government money, mail fraud, and money laundering. If he is found guilty, he could face up to 30 years in prison. The article on Your News Wire mixes the alleged Ortiz-Vélez scheme with another case of fraud in Puerto Rico. Two finance directors in Tao Baja were accused of misusing federal funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Health and Human Services. The Your News Wire story implies that this money was meant as hurricane relief funds, calling it ""assistance funds"" that were given ""during the same general time frame as the disaster."" This scheme took place from 2014 until early 2016, long before Hurricane Maria in September 2017. The money was meant to be used for promoting economic development and building new public facilities. Instead, the finance directors put the funds toward paying municipal employees and contractors. This investigation is ongoing, and, again, separate from the investigation into Ortiz-Vélez. There have been allegations against Cruz as well, which some outlets have connected to misuse of federal disaster relief funds. In February 2018, a former government worker sued the municipality of San Juan. She claims that the city was committing fraud by paying some contractors far more than others. She also claims she was demoted for speaking out against the corruption.   A local San Juan paper reported that, according to two unnamed sources, the FBI has opened an investigation into the alleged fraud. However, the plaintiff of the suit resigned in June 2017, before Hurricane Maria. The suit does not include any mention of federal disaster aid. The article said, ""Puerto Rico Mayor Facing Fraud Charges Over $3M In Federal Disaster Relief."" The article was styled to make it seem that Cruz, the vocal San Juan mayor, was responsible for the fraud. The entire first half of the article focuses on her liberal politics and her objections to Trump, rather than any specific crimes. All of this is severely misleading. The reporting on the underlying fraud itself is bungled. It has nothing to do with ""federal disaster relief."" The story mixes up two unrelated cases of fraud stemming from Puerto Rico that took place over a year before Maria struck. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2018/jul/19/blog-posting/misleading-article-implies-puerto-rico-hurricane-a/

Roman McAllen correct that Texas Railroad Commission has nothing to do with railroads
","Roman McAllen of Denton offered delegates to the Texas Democratic Party convention a familiar refrain about the state’s anachronistically named oil and gas regulatory agency. ""Finally, we have to change the name,"" McAllen said in his June 22, 2018 speech. ""The current one is very misleading. The Railroad Commission of Texas has nothing to do with railroads. This would be like calling the Food and... Drug Administration the Department of Transportation. This is about basic transparency,"" he said. McAllen, the 2018 Democratic nominee for a seat on the commission, faces the Republican incumbent, Christi Craddick, on the November 2018 ballot. It’s widely known the commission regulates oil and gas drilling and production, well plugging and site remediation, pipeline safety and damage prevention, surface mining of coal and uranium, gas utility rates and alternative fuels. Still, was McAllen right that the commission--steered by three elected members, each one having a six-year term--has nothing to do with railroads? The commission says so on a web page titled ""Who Regulates Railroads in Texas?"" That page says the commission ""no longer has any jurisdiction or authority over railroads."" Yet the agency started with a vigorous rail focus. In 1890, James Stephen Hogg won election as governor while calling for a constitutional amendment authorizing lawmakers to start a commission to bird-dog customer-gouging out-of-state railroad companies, according to a 1905 book compiling Hogg’s papers. Hogg devoted 6,000 words of his April 1890 campaign kickoff speech to making the case for a commission to regulate rates and traffic on the state’s rail lines. His slogan: ""Hogg and The Commission."" Hogg said in his speech: ""The issue so sharply drawn in the present campaign is, shall corporate power or the State control? The fight is on and the issue is unmistakably presented."" The law creating the commission took effect in June 1891. In its infancy, the commission regulated in-state railroad rates including passenger fares, according to a commission web page titled ""The 'Railroads' in the Railroad Commission."" ""When the commission was founded in 1891, there were some 8,700 miles of track"" in the state, the page says. ""When the railroads reached their peak in Texas in 1930, there were 17,500 miles."" But following World War II, goods increasingly ""began to travel by truck and people by buses and cars and the miles of track began to shrink,"" the page says. Meantime, oil and gas regulation proved paramount. In a 1981 book on the commission, David Prindle of the University of Texas said that a few years after the Spindletop oil well gushed in 1901--birthing the economy’s dominant oil sector--the commission landed responsibility for regulating oil and gas pipelines. Prindle’s book calls the commission’s subsequent actions dealing with railroads ""of only limited interest."" Changes in federal law later vested rail safety in a federal agency (1970) and left states with no guiding role in rail rate-setting (1980), the commission’s ""railroads"" web page says. In 2005, finally, legislators transferred remaining rail safety oversight to the Texas Department of Transportation, ""leaving the commission with no regulatory authority related to any aspect of the rail industry,"" the agency says. Name-change moves stall McAllen is hardly the first person to say the agency’s name should reflect its revised duties. But promoters of a change failed to persuade the 2017 Legislature to act and previous efforts to swap in an energy-oriented name faltered in 2005, 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015, according to a 2016 news account. That Austin American-Statesman news story quoted Rep. Tom Craddick, the Midland Republican and former House speaker representing the oil-rich Permian Basin region, in opposition. Craddick’s daughter, Christi Craddick, who seeks re-election against McAllen, said then that changing the name wasn’t her priority when it’d cost money needed for other needs--a position she reaffirmed in a statement emailed to us by an aide, Lauren Spreen. Our ruling McAllen said the railroad commission has nothing to do with railroads. It did, for more than a century. But it hasn’t had a thing to do with railroads since late 2005.

Campaigning on July 14, 2018 for U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., Sanders told a crowd in Eau Claire: ""The three wealthiest people"" own ""more wealth than the bottom half of the American people."" The U.S. senator, an independent from Vermont, previously made the claim on Facebook and repeated it three days after his Wisconsin appearance in a column in USA Today. What we found is the wealth lead enjoyed by the three billionaires is even larger than what Sanders said. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. A study Before we dig in, an important note about the nation’s wealth gap: Many Americans make a good income, have some savings and investments, and own a nice home; they also have debt, for a mortgage, credit cards and other bills. The result is, even some people with relatively healthy incomes, as well as many poorer people, have a negative net worth. To back Sanders’ claim, his campaign pointed us to a November 2017 news article in Forbes. The business magazine reported on a study published that month by the Institute for Policy Studies, which the article described as a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C. The study, which advocates for reducing wealth inequality, also gained news coverage from USA Today and The Guardian. And its authors wrote opinion articles about it for Newsweek and the Los Angeles Times.    The numbers The study used data from Forbes’ 2017 ranking of the 400 richest Americans; and data for the rest of the country from the 2016 Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances, which the study says has become widely accepted as the most comprehensive government dataset documenting household wealth. PolitiFact has also relied on this Fed survey in our wealth fact checks. The first finding the study reported was this: The three wealthiest people in the United States now own more wealth than the entire bottom half of the American population combined, a total of 160 million people. Those individuals and their source of wealth are, according to the study: 1. Bill Gates, Microsoft: $89 billion 2. Jeff Bezos, Amazon: $81.5 billion 3. Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway: $78 billion That’s a total of $248.5 billion. The wealth of the bottom 160 million was $245 billion, the Institute for Policy Studies' Josh Hoxie told us. That’s a gap of $3.5 billion. Hoxie, a former a aide to Sanders, also pointed out that the wealth of the three billionaires has ballooned to $330 billion, according to Forbes’ latest estimate. We don’t have an updated estimate for the bottom 160 million American, as the Fed survey is done only once every three years. But Hoxie said it’s nearly impossible that the wealth of Americans at the bottom has grown nearly as much as that of the three billionaires. For the 160 million people at the bottom of the scale, by the way, the study used the net worth figure reported by the Fed and then subtracted automobiles and other ""durable goods"" such as electronics, furniture, and household appliances, from that figure. Subtracting durable goods from net worth ""offers us a more accurate depiction of household wealth as these items are not easily sellable and neither appreciate nor hold constant their value,"" the study says. Other viewpoints More fact checks on wealth inequality Michael Moore, in 2011: ""Just 400 Americans -- 400 -- have more wealth than half of all Americans combined."" True. One Wisconsin Now, in 2013: ""The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined."" True. Starbucks, in 2015: ""White people control almost 90 percent of the nation's wealth."" True. The study’s methodology is sound and its conclusion cited by Sanders is accurate, according to Abdur Chowdhury, an emeritus economics professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, and economics professor Emmanuel Saez, director of the Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California, Berkeley. As an aside, we’ll note that Saez also said Sanders’ claim is ""somewhat meaningless."" ""The meaningful thing to say,"" Saez told us, ""is the bottom half of the U.S. families owns essentially no wealth on net, because debts cancel out whatever small assets they may have, on average."" Our rating Sanders says: ""The three wealthiest people"" own ""more wealth than the bottom half of the American people."" The wealth of Gates, Bezos and Buffett exceeded that of the 160 million at the bottom of the scale, according to a 2017 study. And more recent estimates indicate the wealth of the three has since grown dramatically, widening the gap even more.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrong on several counts about unemployment
","  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist and former organizer for Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, attracted national attention after her upset primary victory over Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in a Queens- and Bronx-based district. But critics pounced on some of her remarks during an interview on the PBS show Firing Line with Margaret Hoover. During the interview, Ocasio-Cortez said, ""Unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs. Unemployment is low because people are working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and can barely feed their family."" (It’s at about 5:45 in this video.) This comment drew criticism from a number of right-leaning outlets, including the National Review, Hot Air, TownHall.com and Reason. In our review, we found many reasons why unemployment is low, and not for the overwork that Ocasio-Cortez cited. The biggest factors include strong economic confidence and the long-running economic recovery. (Her campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) The Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps track of how many people work two jobs rather than just one. Over the past 12 months, the number of multiple job holders has ranged between 6 million and 7 million. That compares to more than 148 million Americans who are employed in a single job. So by the official statistics, multiple job holders account for a tiny fraction of American workers. And this percentage isn’t high by historical standards. The percentage has moved in a pretty narrow band — 4.7 percent to 5.2 percent — during the recovery from the Great Recession. That range is actually below where it was between 1994 and the Great Recession. In fact, the percentage was at its highest (as high as 6.5 percent) during the peak of the 1990s boom. This assertion is equally dubious. The Bureau of Labor Statistics breaks down its count of people with multiple jobs into three categories: people working one full-time job and one part-time job; people with two part-time jobs; and people working two full-time jobs. A worker with two full-time jobs is the smallest category of the three. Since the entire pie chart is equivalent to the small red column in the previous graph, the people who might be working 70 or 80 hours a week amount to a tiny percentage of a tiny percentage — 310,000 people at most in a pool of employed Americans totaling more than 150 million. It’s also worth noting that on average, Americans aren’t working more today than they have been in the recent past. The average number of hours worked in the private sector has hugged tightly to about 34.5 hours a week since 2006, except for a dip during the Great Recession. When the BLS determines the unemployment rate, a person is counted as employed as long as they have at least one job. They don’t get counted twice if they have two jobs. So Ocasio-Cortez is wrong in saying multiple job holding and long hours affect the unemployment rate. It’s worth remembering that both of the factors Ocasio-Cortez cited — people working multiple jobs and long hours — are actually good things for the labor market, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""Increases in the number of multiple job holders and longer average work hours almost always accompany a strengthening labor market — that is, a job market in which it is easier to find work, in which spells of unemployment are heading downwards, and in which the ranks of the unemployed are shrinking,"" Burtless said. Ocasio-Cortez said, ""Unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs. Unemployment is low because people are working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and can barely feed their family."" Even taking into account rhetorical excess, her statement is off in multiple ways. Fewer than one in 20 employed Americans holds a second job of any type, and the people who might be working as much as 70 or 80 hours a week represent a tiny fraction of that tiny fraction. The rates for either statistic are not high by historical standards. In any case, the BLS does not use either of those factors in determining the official unemployment rate.

Did Adam Putnam endorse a bill that gutted water quality regulations?
","The toxic green algae bloom spreading across Lake Okeechobee has seeped into the state’s political races, including Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam's quest for Florida governor. The Democratic Governors Association slammed Putnam, a Republican, in a July 10 press release, saying he cheered on weakened water quality regulations and lax oversight that they say contributed to the mess in Lake Okeechobee.   The Democrats further pushed the point on ""Algae Adam"" in a Medium post-July 13: ""As Agriculture Commissioner, Putnam backed a water bill that gutted water quality regulations."" Did Putnam back a bill that ""gutted"" water regulations, and what does that have to do with the toxic situation in Lake Okeechobee? Putnam backed a bill in 2016 that changed the oversight of water quality conditions across the state. Supporters of the measure say the law was crafted to try and reduce pollution and improve water quality. Environmentalists say the law ended up doing the opposite. For years, pollutants such as fertilizers, pesticides and human and animal waste have been pumped into Florida’s springs and water resources. SB 552, signed into law by Gov. Rick Scott in 2016, came about as a way to address the pollution and over-pumping, including at Lake Okeechobee, though whether it helps the situation is debated. The measure, among other things, required the Department of Environmental Protection to define the standard for what counts as ""harmful to the water resources;"" revised Florida statutes so that there would be stricter requirements for certain sized wells; and required that water management districts adopt recovery and prevention policies. It also established water-flow levels for springs.  The bill overwhelmingly passed both chambers of the Legislature with just two dissenting votes from House Democrats. Putnam did not have a vote, but he did vouch for the bill. (Putnam also supported a very similar piece of legislation, HB 7003, in 2015.) ""This builds on Florida's strong tradition of water policy that dates back to the early '70s,"" Putnam told reporters at the time. ""And it won't be the end. I think there are things we need to continue to do but in that march toward progress. This appears to be moving and I hope it goes all the way, unlike last year."" One of the primary concerns with the new law is that it did not create clear-cut standards for water quality monitoring. Under the new law, polluting farms can meet standards by adhering to Best Management Practices, such as building fences to keep animals out waterways. But environmentalists said that there are steps the bill could have taken when it comes to monitoring these farms, like involving the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Instead of giving more power to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to cut back on pollution, the bill put more oversight into the hands of Putnam's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Environmentalists said this amounts to voluntary pollution control strategies, rather than the concrete monitoring program they wanted to see. This provision impacts Lake Okeechobee water quality because the algae bloom covering the lake is in part caused by excess nitrates in agricultural run-off. ""The 2016 water bill did effectively ‘gut water regulations,’ "" said Kimberly Mitchell, the executive director of the Everglades Trust. ""Before that, water management districts were allowed to implement pollution controls more broadly."" More than 100 environmental organizations and businesses wrote to legislators, outlining criticisms and proposing 13 amendments. As an example, they singled out a provision for monitoring consumptive water permits. The law requires consumptive use permits for pipes with an ""inside diameter of 8 inches or more."" Before this, utilities had to have a consumptive use permit for more pipes under 8 inches, too. The Democratic Governors Association said Putnam ""backed a water bill that gutted water quality regulations."" There's no doubt that Putnam supported a bipartisan law that made changes to state water policy. But the group's attack ignores the regulations and procedures that remain in place.

Rogers blames President Obama for $3 trillion in debt
","
Republicans have portrayed President Barack Obama as a big spender. And though state Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers (R-Woodstock) doesn't politic on the federal level, he's joined the chorus blaming the president for the national debt's growth.

In a flier recently received by the AJC's PolitiFact Georgia, Rogers said, ""Congress and President Obama have accumulated more debt since he took office than the total amount of debt accumulated during the first 200 years of the United States existence.""

More than the first 200 years of the country? That sounds like a lot of debt. We decided to check it out.

Rogers is running against Democrat Patrick Thompson in November.

PolitiFact Georgia discussed Rogers' contention with two federal budget experts: James Horney of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Brian Riedl of the Heritage Foundation, which has conservative roots.

These groups rarely agree with each other, but these experts do agree that Rogers' comparison doesn't work.

""We're not big supporters of President Obama here,"" Riedl said, ""but I do agree that it's not a fair assessment.""

First, some basics about the national debt. Basically, it's the total debt the country has accumulated over time. If a country spends $5 million more than it takes in for 20 years, its national debt is $100 million.

There are two different kinds of that debt. There's the gross national debt, which includes money the government borrows from its own pools of money like the Social Security fund. The White House estimates that debt will be about $13.8 trillion by the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30.

There's also the national debt held by the public, a figures economists prefer to use.That's the amount the government borrows from individuals, banks, and state, local and foreign governments with the promise of paying them back. It will be about $9.3 trillion by the end of the fiscal year. 

Economists agree that both debt figures are troubling amounts, but not just because they're such massive amounts of money. It's because the debt held by the public amounts to 63.6percent of the gross domestic product, a figure that represents the value of all goods and services produced in one year within the U.S. economy.

That's why when economists think about the size of the national debt, they typically describe it as a percentage of GDP. It tells them more about how much of a problem that debt poses. If a family owes $60,000 but earns $6 million a year, it's not in big trouble. But if it owes $60,000 and makes $60,000, it's got problems.

Rogers didn't use this widely accepted approach when he calculated how much the national debt had grown under Obama's watch. Instead, he took the gross national debt from 1989, 200 years after the federal government was formed. This amount was about $2.9 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury Department figures.

Then Rogers took the gross national debt for January 2009, when Obama came into office, which was about $10.6 trillion, and subtracted it from projected national debt for fiscal year 2010. He came up with $3 trillion, which is more than 1989's debt. (We came up with slightly more: $3.2 trillion.)

$2.9 trillion is less than $3 trillion. Therefore, Congress and President Obama have accumulated more debt since he took office than the total during the first 200 years of the United States existence.

Q.E.D.?

Not really. Federal budget experts pointed out some big problems with Rogers' approach.

First is that 1989 isn't the best year for a comparison if you're trying to figure out Obama's impact on the national debt, Horney said. A lot of debt has accumulated in the generation since then, with help from both sides of the aisle.

""It's convenient to cut it off in '89 and ignore what's happened since then,"" Horney said.

Second is that it's not fair to compare the 1989 and 2010 debt totals. Those numbers aren't adjusted for inflation. Furthermore, the comparison doesn't take into account that our current economy is very different than it was 21 years ago. The population has grown, the importance of various industries has shifted, and overall economic conditions have changed. Back then, the economy was growing. Now, we're experiencing our worst downturn since the Great Depression.

Third is that it's not fair to blame Obama for budgets that he didn't control, Riedl said. The 2009 budget went into effect Oct. 1, 2008, almost four months before Obama took office.

The experts we consulted suggested different approaches.

By Riedl's reckoning, for 2009, you can hold Obama responsible for discretionary spending he signed off on after he took office, plus the $220 billion of the stimulus package spent that year. You can also pin the debt for fiscal year 2010 on him as well.

This comes to about $2.1 trillion, according to Riedl, which is less than the national debt's dollar amount in 1989.

Horney is reluctant to assign a hard number to Obama's debt responsibility. It can vary dramatically based upon what share of responsibility you think he has in Iraq spending, recovery measures and other budget items.

Horney has a different approach. From Jan. 16, 2009, the Friday before Obama took office, to Aug. 24, the national debt has grown by about $2.5 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. That amounts to roughly 17 percent of the country's GDP. That's far less than the debt accumulated by 1989, when the national debt amounted to 40.6percent of the country's GDP.

Conservative and liberal experts consulted by PolitiFact Georgia think Rogers took the wrong approach. Riedl called it ""kind of an unfair comparison."" Horney called it ""misleading.""

Rogers said the statement wasn't designed to be misleading. He looked up the facts to make sure they were correct.

""The statement itself, word for word, is factual,"" Rogers said. 

While the numbers used by Rogers are generally correct, his calculation doesn't make sense. Rogers ignored critical facts about the economy and national debt that budget analysts of all stripes routinely take into account. Plus, he blamed Obama for debt he had little, if anything, to do with.

When those experts performed what they consider a more fair and accurate comparison, neither concluded that the debt Obama ran up is equal to the amount run up by this country during its first 200 years. Both came up with much lower figures.

AG Greg Abbott says El Paso highway was closed because of bullets flying across border
","
Asked last week whether he would support an Arizona-style immigration law in Texas, Attorney General Greg Abbott pivoted to a theme popular among state leaders recently: the threat to public safety of violence along the Texas-Mexico border. 
""The challenges that we are seeing on the border are unprecedented,"" Abbott said during a Thursday interview with the Texas Tribune. ""The challenges to the health, safety and welfare of Texans are greater than they've ever been."" 
Among the examples Abbott gave was ""the closure of a highway in El Paso for a time period because of safety issues because of bullets flying across the border."" 
We wondered whether Abbott, a Republican who is being challenged by Democratic nominee Barbara Ann Radnofsky this fall, got that right. Did bullets really cross the border, causing the highway to be closed? 
One thing is certain: Border violence has been on the minds of Texas officials as the war between Mexican drug cartels continues to rage. El Paso, the state's sixth-largest city, adjoins Juárez, a city the Associated Press has described as ""ground zero in Mexico's relentless drug war."" 
In an Aug. 24 dispatch, the AP said that ""wildly aimed gunfire has become common in Juárez, a sprawling city of shanty neighborhoods that once boomed with manufacturing plants."" 
Last month, we rated Half True a statement by Gov. Rick Perry that bullets from Mexico had hit El Paso's city hall and bombs had exploded in that city. He was right about the bullets, which struck city hall on June 29, but was off on the bomb (although a car bomb was set off in Juárez in July). 
And in March, we found Barely True U.S. Sen. John Cornyn's statement that spillover violence was ""real and escalating."" 
President Barack Obama, who fielded a letter from Perry urging more troops along the border during an Austin visit last month, returned to Texas on Tuesday to speak to soldiers at Fort Bliss in El Paso before he gave a national address from the Oval Office to mark the end of the United States' combat mission in Iraq. 
But back to those flying bullets. In response to our inquiry, the attorney general's office sent us an AP report describing an Aug. 21 incident. We contacted the El Paso Police Department, and spokesman Darrel Petry told us that just before 6 p.m. that day, Border Patrol agents heard gunfire in western Juárez. 
The AP has described the shooting as a ""30-minute firefight between gunmen and local and federal police."" The El Paso Times has reported that a man in his 20s was killed in Juárez and that three Juárez police officers were wounded in the incident. 
Petry told us that at the request of the Border Patrol, the El Paso Police Department shut down Paisano Drive between Santa Fe Street and Executive Center Boulevard, a stretch of about 3.5 miles. Paisano, also known as U.S. 85, runs through downtown El Paso and along the Rio Grande. 
Petry said the road, which he described as four lanes with stop signs and stoplights, was closed for about 30 minutes. Petry, who told us that he has worked at the police department since 1982, said he could not remember another time that an El Paso street had been closed because of gunfire in Mexico. 
According to an Aug. 24 El Paso Times article, a building at the University of Texas at El Paso was struck by a bullet that police suspect was fired during the incident across the border. An Aug. 22 press release from the university said that there were no injuries and that the ""bullet struck the south door of Bell Hall, went through the glass panel in the door and was found embedded in an office door frame."" 
During an Aug. 23 news conference that we watched online, the president of the university, Diana Natalicio, said campus police found the bullet hole during a routine patrol the morning after the gunfight. ""We are living next door to a city that is carrying on with gunfights on a fairly regular basis,"" Natalicio said. She said she thought that the increase in violence in Juárez had hurt El Paso's image, which she described as safe. 
So, were there any other suspected bullet crossings from the Aug. 21 gunbattle in Juárez? 
An El Paso police statement released the next day said that officers who helped close Paisano ""did not report seeing any bullets cross the border"" but that police had received a report that a bullet may have hit a vehicle in El Paso. Petry told us that police had not confirmed that report. 
Also, an Aug. 25 El Paso Times article reported that employees of the Rescue Mission of El Paso, a homeless shelter on Paisano Drive, said one of its buildings had been hit by a bullet. 
According to an Aug. 31 story on the Times' website, U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, said he and Obama talked about the ""rollercoaster violence along the border"" and about the bullets that hit El Paso City Hall and UTEP during the ride to Texas on Air Force One. 
So, where does that leave Abbott's statement? Gunfire in Mexico did spur El Paso authorities to close a section of U.S. 85, an action that a police spokesman said was unprecedented. One bullet was found in a Texas university building, and other reports, though unconfirmed as yet, indicate more ""bullets were flying across the border,"" as Abbott said.

Chef Jamie Oliver praises McDonald's in England
","
Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is a well-known crusader for healthier eating. So it may have come as a surprise to hear him give a shout-out on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Aug. 29, 2010, to the fast-food giant McDonald's -- or at least the restaurants in his homeland, England. 
Oliver, AKA the Naked Chef, is perhaps best known to American audiences for his Emmy-winning reality program Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution on ABC, in which he tried to transform the eating habits of the residents of Huntington, W.Va., statistically one of the unhealthiest cities in the country. 
On ABC's This Week, Oliver said the food revolution is about giving people the tools to make good, nutritious choices. 
But host Christiane Amanpour asked Oliver to respond to a comment David Letterman made to him when he appeared on the Late Show: ""Try as hard as you might, you're never going to succeed, because we are living in a culture dominated by the commerce of selling food which is inherently unhealthy,"" Letterman said. 
Said Oliver: ""In the one way, he's right. You know, the structure of commerce and food in America is so intertwined in broadcast, print media, advertising, TV. I think that the problem we have to have -- and it's an interesting one. I'll throw it back at you. Like fast food I've hated for many years. And the last two years, I like stopped. And I actually now start to see (fast food chains) ironically as part of the solution. 
""Now, I'll give you -- I'll give you one brand, like McDonald's. McDonald's, in England, has had its best three years ever, profitability. It only sells organic milk, free range eggs. You know, it's got an incredible standard of beef. And their ethics is really ... moving. But that's nothing like the one in the States. And the only distinguishing part is the public and what they expect."" 
Part of the allure of McDonald's is its uniformity, that a Big Mac in New York will be the same as one in London. And so we wondered if Oliver was right that McDonald's restaurants in England really ""only sell organic milk"" and ""free range eggs,"" and that, by implication, they are dramatically different and more healthy than McDonald's restaurants in the United States. 
We made queries with McDonald's officials in the U.S. and Britain, and neither responded, but we were able to piece together the pertinent facts from company web pages and documents. 
Let's break this into two parts. 
First, do McDonald's restaurants in England ""only sell"" organic milk? 
According to the McDonald's UK website, all of the bottled milk offered for sale in UK McDonald's (most of it sold along with kids' meals) is ""semi-skimmed organic."" In 2007, McDonald's UK made an even bigger commitment to organic milk, announcing that all the milk served with the teas and coffees it sells in 1,200 outlets in the UK will come from organic British cows. The company said organic farmers who supply McDonald's ""don't use (genetically modified) feed or artificial pesticides in fields where their cows graze."" Media reports suggested McDonald's alone could account for 5 percent of the UK’s organic milk supplies. 
Organic milk is not, however, used in milkshakes in the British stores. 
According to the website, ""Organic milk is still a relatively small industry in the UK and McDonald's simply can't find a supplier that can meet the high volume demands. The company is in talks with the dairy industry about how it can facilitate more farmers switching to organic but, until the organic food supply chain can guarantee that it can supply the required amount, McFlurries, Sundaes and Milkshakes will continue to be made from non-organic milk from the British Isles."" 
(In the U.S., McDonald's does not use organic milk.) 
Second, do McDonald's restaurants in England only use free-range eggs (meaning, eggs that come from hens that are not in cages and are free to roam outside)? 
McDonald's does, and the move generated quite a bit of positive press for McDonald's, including a ""Good Egg"" award from Compassion in World Farming in recognition of McDonald's Europe committing to using 100 percent free-range, cage-free eggs in all locations in the European Union by the end of this year. 
""We’re thrilled to be awarding such a well-known company for moving to cage-free eggs across the whole of Europe,"" said Dr. Lesley Lambert, Director of Research & Food Policy at Compassion in World Farming, in a press release for the award. ""McDonald’s decision will benefit huge numbers of farm birds. By choosing to do the right thing on eggs across Europe, McDonald’s has shown great leadership on an issue which many consumers feel strongly about."" 
McDonald's in the United States, however, has not embraced a similar switch. In April, the Humane Society of the United States (which owns stock in McDonald's USA) proposed to shareholders that the company switch 5 percent of the eggs it purchases for its U.S. locations to ""cage-free"" eggs by January 2011. 
The Board of Directors recommended against the switch, saying it would not be in the best interest of shareholders. 
""As we have examined this issue over the years, we have determined that there is no agreement in the global scientific community about how to balance the advantages and disadvantages of laying hen housing systems,"" the board wrote in a proxy statement. ""Cage-free systems, for instance, allow birds to exhibit more natural behaviors, but may pose more risk with regard to the spread of infectious diseases. Furthermore, there seems to be a significant gap in scientific knowledge related to a wide range of sustainability impacts of laying hen housing—environmental impact, food safety, worker safety, animal health and well-being, and food affordability."" 
According to a New York Times story about the proposal in May 2009, ""McDonald’s USA announced its participation in a coalition with leading animal welfare scientists, academics, non-governmental organizations, such as the American Humane Association and the American Veterinary Medical Association, food manufacturers, egg suppliers and other retail companies to study housing alternatives for egg-laying hens in the U.S. The study will look at the sustainability impacts of different laying hen housing options, including cage-free aviary housing, enriched housing (which includes nests and perches) and conventional caged housing systems (currently used by the vast majority of the contemporary U.S. food supply system)."" 
Paul Shapiro, senior director of the Humane Society’s factory farming campaign, said McDonald's has been ""looking into"" the issue for years. 
""There is a dramatic difference between the two companies (McDonald's in the U.S. versus the U.K.) with regard to animal welfare,"" Shapiro said. 
In April, a spokeswoman for McDonald’s, Lisa McComb, told the New York Times the disparity was due to the high consumer demand for cage-free eggs in Europe and a more robust cage-free egg production infrastructure there. 
Oliver doesn't explicitly argue the U.K. McDonald's restaurants offer more nutritious food, but given Amanpour's question -- and the topic of the segment -- we think many people would be left with that impression. So is it true that the organic milk and free-range eggs mean healthier food than in the U.S.? 
""No, that would not reliably mean better nutrition,"" said Dr. David L. Katz, director of the Prevention Research Center at the Yale University School of Medicine. ""It appeals to the popular sentiment, without changing much about the food."" 
One can make a case that using ""cage-free"" hens is more humane to the animals, Katz said, but that doesn't directly correlate to better nutrition for consumers (though it may reduce the risk of bacterial infection). 
As for using organic skim milk, Katz said there is definitely value, health-wise, to using fat-free milk. But the nutritional value of organic milk versus non-organic is unproven, he said. 
""I am a proponent of organic dairy,"" Katz said. ""But there is no definitive evidence that organic means better health value in people. I think there's probably a potentially small movement in nutritional value. But there is a much larger movement in public perception."" 
Katz said McDonald's could take much more meaningful steps to improve the nutritional value of its food, for example, by changing to whole wheat bread in buns or making the burgers lower in saturated fat. But just switching to organic milk and using free-range eggs doesn't much alter the nutritional value of McDonald's meals, he said. 
As for Oliver's comment, he's correct that McDonald's in England uses organic milk. Organic milk is served with coffee and tea, and for bottled milk. But Oliver was off a bit when he said it ""only uses"" organic milk. The British McDonald's stores still use non-organic milk in milkshakes. 
Oliver was on the mark when he noted that in the U.K., McDonald's uses only free-range eggs, while they are not used in the U.S. But when Oliver said McDonald's in England is ""nothing like"" the U.S. one, he implies the policies in England translate to substantially more nutritional food offerings. While the U.K. policies have drawn praise from animal rights groups, experts say it's a stretch to say they translate to better nutrition. And so we rule Oliver's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/31/jamie-oliver/chef-jamie-oliver-praises-mcdonalds-england/

Alan Grayson attacks Daniel Webster's 'stairway to nowhere'
","
Central Florida U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson is digging on some 1970s Led Zeppelin in his first ad attacking Republican opponent Daniel Webster.

The ad is called ""Dan Webster's Stairway to Nowhere."" See where this is going, Zeppelin fans?

It opens with someone ripping off Jimmy Page's recognizable guitar introduction to ""Stairway to Heaven."" A narrator talks over a black-and-white image of Webster, a longtime state legislator and former House speaker.

""When career politician Daniel Webster became speaker of the House, he wasted $32,000 of our money on a spiral staircase for his office,"" the narrator says, before moving on to a claim that he used tax money for private flights.

The ad then finishes with a spin off of Robert Plant's vocals.

""And he's charged us for a stairway to nowhere.""

To be honest, it's a pretty poor rendition.

But we're PolitiFact Florida, not American Idol, so we'll stick to the factual claims in the ad -- specifically about the stairwell.

Stepping stones to the staircase

Webster was elected to the state House in 1980. In 1996, he became the first Republican state House speaker in more than 100 years after the GOP seized power.

That also put him in charge of improvements and renovations to House offices and facilities. Each new speaker traditionally has made changes, upgrades, or renovations. In 1999, Speaker John Thrasher, now a state senator and chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, approved nearly $7 million for the House chamber -- now adorned in mahogany -- the Speaker's Office, and House office building.

In 2002, leaders of the House and Senate spent about $1.5 million on furniture, structural changes, even a private bathroom. On the other hand, former Speaker Allan Bense spent only about $1,500 on changes in 2004, according to the St. Petersburg Times.

According to newspaper accounts Webster spent about $100,000 in taxpayer dollars on improvements to House facilities in his first months as speaker, including $31,983 on a spiral staircase.

The staircase connected the Republican Majority Office on the Capitol's third floor with the Speaker's Office above it on the fourth floor. The staircase was intended to make it easier to move back and forth between the two offices -- namely, it allowed legislators and Webster as speaker to avoid walking through the public hallways filled with lobbyists, reporters and members of the public. 
The staircase ""will allow us to better coordinate things between the Speaker's Office and the Majority Office,"" Webster said at the time. He also noted that he took the idea from Democrats, who previously had drawn up plans for a spiral staircase of their own. 
It was built in a spiral style because it was the only way it could work given the space. 
The Grayson ad includes an image of an elaborate white spiral staircase to help make its point about Webster. 
But that's not the Webster staircase, said Todd Reid, staff director for the Florida House Majority Office. 
The staircase was closed off in 2006 during more than $500,000 of renovations ordered by then-Speaker Marco Rubio. The stairway's fourth-floor landing became the new offices of the speaker's chief of staff. 
""It was a standard black metal staircase,"" Reid said. ""It certainly wasn't heavy on the accouterments."" 
Reid described the staircase as noisy and said whenever someone walked up or down it, people could hear the staircase rattling from both offices. 
He said the bottom half of the staircase remains in place; a closet was built around it.  
""If you were in Tallahassee, I'd take you in to see it,"" Reid told PolitiFact Florida. 
Your humble fact-checker didn't have time to jump in a car for the five-hour trip to Tallahassee, but we were able to send the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald's Lee Logan for an exclusive tour. 
Cribs: Staircase to Nowhere-edition 
Logan filed the following report, complete with a picture. 
Behind a door labeled ""No Entry"" in the House Majority Office is the famed Webster staircase. The small closet without lights is used so rarely that Reid had to hunt down someone in the House Sergeant at Arms office to get a key to the door. 
The bottom half of the black spiral staircase is still bolted to the floor. (Stairs are simple black metal, with a black metal railing.) Pieces of the top half are also in the closet, including a large piece that rests on top of the lower portion.

The ceiling of the closet is now covered over with concrete, forming the floor of the chief of staff's office on the fourth floor. Reid says it's unlikely the stairway would be re-installed because the fourth floor spot is ""prime real estate"" -- now the House speaker and his chief of staff have direct access to one another through a door.

Before Rubio made the space into the chief of staff's office, the staircase came up through a hole in the floor and emptied into a common area that also housed a few supplies.

Reid said the closet could be used for supplies if the stairs were removed. But he speculated that they weren't taken out because they're simply too big. Also, a speaker sometime in the future might find a use for the stairs.

The stairs were used ""irregularly,"" Reid said, usually on peak days when the Capitol was crowded. He also recalled former Gov. Jeb Bush occasionally using the stairs.

Currently, if a staffer (not Joe Public) wanted to go from the Majority Office to the Speaker's Office, he or she could go up a back stairwell and cut through the Member's Lounge, which requires a key card and is reserved for lawmakers. Speaker Larry Cretul has said staffers can cut through the area if they don't loiter or disturb the lawmakers. 
Our ruling 
Grayson's ad is unintentionally ironic in that Webster's ""stairway to nowhere"" actually now is a stairway to nowhere, as it's bolted to the ground of a seldom-used closet. The stairway leads to a concrete ceiling, which now serves as the floor of an office above. Those changes were made by Marco Rubio in 2006. The stairs haven't been used since then. 
But that's not how Webster left it. When he became speaker in 1996, Webster did what most every speaker has done in recent times -- he spent taxpayer money on House renovations. The amount has varied wildly over the years depending on the size of the renovation.

Among the $100,000 or so Webster spent, he allocated just under $32,000 for a plain spiral staircase to internally link the Speaker's Office with the House Republican Offices below.

While Grayson's ad is correct on the reported dollar amount and the type of staircase, we think it's slightly misleading for two reasons. First, the imagery displayed suggests an ornate staircase when the staircase is far from ornate and only a spiral staircase by necessity. Second, it fails to provide the context that most every speaker spends taxpayer dollars on renovations, and several spent more than Webster. We rate the claim Mostly True.

Now cue the Led Zeppelin ... 
(Update Sept. 1: We reached out to the Webster campaign before publishing this story via phone and e-mail, but did not hear back. After publication, Webster spokesman Brian Graham said in an e-mail that the staircase actually cost less than published reports. The original construction contract was for $28,126. The state paid even less, $22,242, Graham said). 
(Update Sept. 3: We noticed that the Grayson ad has been removed from his You Tube web page. We're not sure why).",/factchecks/2010/aug/31/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-attacks-daniel-websters-stairway-nowh/
"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Bud Chiles']","
Chiles says Florida ranks 49th in per capita mental health spending
","
Florida has long had a poor reputation for spending on social services. Bud Chiles, running as an independent for governor, criticizes the state's spending on mental health care.

On his website Chiles said: 
""Nearly $3 billion dollars -- 10 percent of our state’s general fund -- is going to pay for Florida’s prisons. Meanwhile, Florida is 49th in per capita spending on mental health care, and 65 percent of inmates need substance abuse treatment and aren’t getting it. The only way to end this cycle is through community solutions. Let’s stop using a prison cell to solve problems when an ankle bracelet and drug counseling is proven to be more effective. Let’s get resources to communities so that they can provide services locally at less taxpayer expense, creating local jobs and real results.""

In this Truth-O-Meter item, we wanted to explore Chiles' claim that Florida is 49th in per capita spending on mental health.

We spoke to Chiles on Aug. 31, 2010, who directed us to campaign spokeswoman Katie Ottenweller. She said the source of their information was a July 4, 2010, editorial in the Tallahassee Democrat by David L. Miller, a retired senior vice president of Florida Power Corp. who had been chair of the Florida Substance Abuse and Mental Health Corp. The editorial stated that during the 2010 session, Florida legislators cut the $190,000 needed to continue the corporation, which was an independent, nonprofit created by the Legislature.

""The lack of services in Florida is shocking and embarrassing, as well as very costly,"" Miller wrote. ""Our state ranks 49th in per capita spending for mental-health care, an abysmal ranking borne out by the thousands of people who cannot get treatment and end up in our jails, prisons and on the streets.""

Miller did not attribute the per capita spending comparison.

PolitiFact Texas looked at a similar claim made by a candidate for lieutenant governor earlier this year. Marc Katz said that Texas ranked 50th -- last -- in per capita mental health spending. PolitiFact ranked that claim Mostly True because one state was lower than Texas: New Mexico. 
That item cited a report by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute, Inc., posted on a Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation website statehealthfacts.org that compares 50 states' and the District of Columbia per capita mental health spending. The chart ranked Florida 49th with $38.17 per capita followed by Texas at $34.57 and New Mexico in last place at $25.58. 
That report was based on fiscal year 2006 data, said Ted Lutterman, director of research analysis, in an interview. The 2007 report showed Florida 48th but Hawaii did not report and if it had, Florida would have been 49th, Lutterman said. The report based on 2008 data will be finished soon, said Lutterman, who said he is missing Alaska. But Alaska has always been ahead of Florida so he expects Florida to rank 49th again.

""It's been consistent for several years,"" Lutterman said. 
We reached out to several other organizations in the mental health field to determine if they had any other information about Florida's mental health spending ranking. The National Alliance on Mental Illness gives states a grade, and in 2009 gave Florida a ""D."" The ""Grading the States 2009"" report evaluates measures such as the number of programs delivering evidence-based practices, emergency room wait-times, and the quantity of psychiatric beds by setting and whether Medicaid reimburses providers for all, or part of evidence-based practices; and more. In 2009, the organization gave six states an ""F"" and 21 states a ""D."" The report card is not based on per capita spending but gives us a general sense of how Florida compares -- somewhere in the bottom half of states.

The nonprofit Mental Health America published a report in December 2007 called ""Ranking America's Mental Health: An Analysis of Depression Across the States."" Appendix B, which compares state mental health authority expenditures per capita for 50 states plus the District of Columbia, stated that Florida spent $35.96 while three states were lower: Arkansas $35.96, New Mexico $27.78 and Kansas $23.14. That report was based on 2004 data, said spokesman Steve Vetzner.

A Sept. 10, 2009, letter to the editor in the Sun-Sentinel from Bob Sharpe, CEO and president of the Florida Council for Community Mental Health, states that Florida is 49th in per capita mental health spending but does not attribute the source of the ranking. We left a message for Sharpe but did not hear back.

So how does Chiles' claim stack up? He said that Florida was 49th in per capita spending on mental health. The campaign cites an editorial that does not provide the source for the 49th figure. The Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute, Inc., concluded in a 2006 report that Florida ranked 49th and that figure has been quoted several times by mental health experts such as Sharpe. Mental Health America wrote in a 2007 report that Florida was 48th -- but it was based on earlier 2004 data. Based on the information we could find, we rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/31/bud-chiles/chiles-says-florida-ranks-49th-capita-mental-healt/

Donna Brazile says 45 percent of unemployed have been jobless for at least six months
","In a discussion of the economy during the Aug. 29, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile addressed the plight of the long-term unemployed.

She said that ""45 percent of those who've been unemployed, they've been unemployed for six months or longer. They desperately need the skills and the tools to get back into the workplace.""

We thought we'd check to see if Brazile was right.

We turned to the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that calculates the national unemployment rate as well as a host of other labor-related statistics.

We found two relevant numbers that are published monthly: the seasonally adjusted number of unemployed Americans age 16 and over, and the subset of that group that has been unemployed for at least 27 weeks, or a little over six months. We divided the second number by the first for each month of the Obama presidency -- January 2009 to July 2010. That produced the percentage at any given time of all unemployed workers who have been unemployed for more than six months.

Brazile is on solid ground when assessing the past three months. The percentage of unemployed workers who were jobless for more than six months was 45 percent in May 2010, 46 percent in June 2010 and 45 percent in July 2010.

But for most of the Obama presidency, the ratio was lower. It climbed slowly, starting at 23 percent in January 2009. It hit 30 percent in June 2009 and 40 percent in December 2009 before cracking 45 percent in May 2010.

Brazile's only error here was to use the wrong verb tense. The way she phrased it suggested that 45 percent of those who have been unemployed during the current recession were unemployed for at least six months. That's actually been true only for the past three months -- that is, 17 months into the Obama presidency and 32 months into the recession. A more accurate way of phrasing it would have been ""45 percent of those who are now unemployed, they've been unemployed for six months or longer.""

Of course, Brazile's grammatical slip-up should not undercut the seriousness of the economic statistic she's citing. Her point about the long-term unemployed is generally accurate even if her encapsulation of it is a little misleading. On balance, then, we rate her statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/31/donna-brazile/donna-brazile-says-45-percent-unemployed-have-been/
"['Ohio', 'Health Care', 'Taxes', 'John Boehner']","
Rep. John Boehner gets it right on new tax-filing mandate for business in the health reform law
","
Congressional Democrats found a lot of ways to pay for the country’s health insurance overhaul, some more popular than others. But one in particular has small lawn services, work-at-home parents and the nation’s smallest businesses mighty concerned. In a move to increase government revenues for health care while cutting tax abuses, Congress included a provision in the bill, approved in March, requiring businesses to file Internal Revenue Service reports on expenditures above $600 to any single vendor.

Here is how John Boehner, the House Republican leader and a leading critic of the provision (and the health insurance bill), derided it when he spoke at the City Club of Cleveland on Aug. 24: ""If a landscaper wants to buy a new lawnmower, or a restaurant needs a new ice-maker, they have to report that to the feds.  If you're a mom-and-pop grocery store, and you buy $1,000 worth of merchandise from 15 different vendors, that's 15 different forms you have to file.""

We have to assume that Boehner, who’s from southwestern Ohio, meant the mom-and-pop store is spending $1,000 on each of the vendors, rather than spreading a $1,000 purchase among 15 vendors (because that would only be $66.66 each). If that is the case, Boehner’s statement is true, or will be as of Jan. 1, 2012.  But Boehner is not the only one calling it nuts. So is the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and even a Cleveland congressman who is generally Boehner’s ideological opposite.

""This obviously was something that needed to be better thought out,"" said that congressman, Democrat Dennis Kucinich, in a telephone interview. ""It has to be fixed, and it will be fixed, because it’s not tolerable.""

Businesses were already required to file an Internal Revenue Service Form 1099 for payments of $600 or more for services they obtained, such as accounting or advertising advice. But according to the National Taxpayer Advocate Service, a watchdog arm of the IRS, the prior law ""generally did not require a person to report payments to purchase goods, presumably because the purchaser could not determine the amount that (less cost of goods sold) would have been income to the vendor.""

And under ""a longstanding regulatory regime,"" the Taxpayer Advocate Service said in a June 30 report to Congress on a host of IRS-related tax issues, ""there was an exception for payments to corporations as well as to tax-exempt and government entities.""

There had been earlier efforts to eliminate the corporate exemption, which would assure that even if a small business was paying in cash for a corporation’s services, the corporation could not avoid paying taxes. But the provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- specifically in section 9006, amending the Internal Revenue Code -- went further by including goods as well as services.

Leaders of the Senate Finance Committee figured this would help pay for part of the health care bill. Congressional Quarterly reported that  provision ""aims to discourage tax cheating by vendors in the form of not disclosing all of their income. The premise is that vendors are more likely to report all of their income and to pay all of the taxes they owe if their customers are telling the IRS, via form 1099, how much they are paying vendors in a given year.""

How extensively would this affect businesses?

Quite extensively, says the Taxpayer Advocate Service. The provision ""would apply to businesses of all sizes, charities and other tax-exempt organizations, and government entities.""  

That includes  26 million non-farm sole proprietorships, 4 million S corporations, 2 million C corporations, 3 million partnerships, 2 million farming businesses, 1 million charities and other tax-exempt organizations, ""and probably more than 100,000 federal, state, and local government entities.""

Small business owners would have to get Tax Identification Numbers or Employer Identification Numbers from their vendors -- and if a vendor refused to provide one, ""the business is required by law to impose back-up withholding at the rate of 28 percent of the purchase price,"" says the Taxpayer Advocate Service report.

Let’s say you own a two-person landscaping company and want to buy $600 worth of mowers from a guy who refurbishes them in his spare time. He won’t give you his identification number. So you’re supposed to pay him $423 and withhold another $168, or 28 percent -- and file the appropriate withholding forms, of course.

That’s assuming that the backyard repairman is willing to part with his mowers at this point in your transaction. In the words of the Taxpayer Advocate Service, this ""could significantly impair the normal course of commerce.""

Boehner and fellow Republicans are using this provision to lampoon Democrats. Yet Democrats say they, too, want to get rid of the provision. The problem is that Democrats need to find a way to make up the revenue, estimated at $17 billion, if they give up this particular one..

Before leaving for their August recess, House Democrats suggested a tax on multinational corporations  that move operations offshore, but that failed. Senate Democrats this fall may try to get some of the money by removing a manufacturing tax deduction from big oil and gas companies while keeping part of the provision intact. They would raise the reporting threshold to $5,000 and exempt companies with fewer than 25 employees.

But as CQ reports, Senate Republicans have a different idea: Repeal the whole provision and soften the health care bill’s requirement that individuals buy insurance with, if needed, government subsidies. If the insurance bill were to cost less, it would reduce the need for this money, Republicans say.

You may agree or disagree with any of these approaches, but the issue here is simply Boehner’s statement on the $600 reporting requirement. It’s about mom-and-pop stores and lawn-mowing services, and we rate it True.

"['Georgia', 'Taxes', 'Michael Thurmond']","
Thurmond claims legislation helped low-income Georgians
","
Michael Thurmond, Georgia's outgoing labor commissioner, calls it the most important legislation he has written.

Back in 1990, when Thurmond was a state representative, he proposed a bill to give a tax credit to Georgians with annual incomes of less than $20,000. Then-Gov. Zell Miller announced his support for the idea a year later, and it became Georgia law shortly thereafter.

Thurmond, the Democratic Party's nominee for the U.S. Senate in the Nov. 2 general election, boasted about the bill's impact on his campaign website. He is running against incumbent Johnny Isakson, a Republican, and Libertarian Party candidate Chuck Donovan.

""Thurmond authored major legislation that has provided more than $250 million in tax relief to Georgia’s senior citizens and working families,"" his campaign bio says.

But is that true? Did Thurmond write the legislation, and did it save Georgians that much money?

AJC PolitiFact Georgia was curious. We first called Thurmond, who was eager to talk about the statement.

Thurmond said his legislation was written to help offset the sales taxes low-income Georgians pay for groceries. Miller was part of a push in the late 1980s to remove groceries from Georgia's 4 percent sales tax. Thurmond offered his suggestion as a compromise. Miller initially opposed Thurmond's idea. But Miller eventually endorsed the plan after being told his idea was not financially viable, particularly since state finances were struggling.

Miller said he was ""swallowing his pride of authorship.""

The refunds in question were relatively small -- they ranged between $5 and $26. Thurmond said the refunds may seem puny to some, but he argued they were a big help to many recipients.

""For a senior citizen, that might be dinner for a week,"" Thurmond said of $26.
 
Thurmond's desire to discuss the claim stems from a successful effort earlier this year to repeal the key portion of his legislation.

State lawmakers added language to a bill on the next to last day of this year's session that ends the refunds. Gov. Sonny Perdue signed the bill on June 4.

Thurmond argues his legislation has helped senior citizens and low-income Georgians. He equates ending the refunds to a tax increase.

""I just don't believe we need to be raising taxes in the midst of a recession, particularly on low-income people,"" Thurmond said in an interview.

State Rep. David Knight, R-Griffin, was the lead sponsor of the effort to repeal the refunds.

""People who have paid in no income tax and have zero tax liability are in essence getting a check back,"" Knight told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in April about the current system. ""If you pay no income taxes, how can you get a refund? How can you justify someone getting a check back from the state? That is, in its purest form, taking away from the taxpayer and giving to someone who has no tax liability. [It's] a redistribution of wealth.""

Thurmond argues the sales tax has a greater proportional impact on the wallets of low-income Georgians. Sarah Beth Guhl, deputy director of the liberal-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, explained Thurmond's point in an e-mail.

""Low-income families consume more of their income, and thus pay the sales tax on a larger portion of their earnings,"" said Guhl, who agreed with Thurmond that a sales tax is regressive on low-income Georgians.

Thurmond admitted an error in his statement the first time we talked to him. The legislation provided about $300.3 million in tax relief over the span of 13 years, according to the most recent Georgia Department of Revenue data available. Thurmond sold himself short by about $50 million.

""It lacks the truth in a positive direction,"" Thurmond said in a telephone interview.

The Thurmond campaign came to the $250 million total using data available on the Revenue Department's website. The data comes from the department's annual statistical reports. The reports on the Revenue Department's Web site, however, only go back to 2000. The Revenue Department has reports that date to 1997 with annual low-income credit figures in its north DeKalb County offices.

But Thurmond's website gives him some serious wiggle room by saying ""more than $250 million in tax relief."" We rate his statement as True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/31/michael-thurmond/thurmond-claims-legislation-helped-low-income-geor/

David Dewhurst opposes the health care overhaul carried into law by Democrats this spring, but he agrees that something needs to be done because ""we spend more money on health care per capita in the United States than any other country in the world,"" Dewhurst said during an Aug. 25 meeting with the Austin American-Statesman editorial board. ""Of the 30 developed countries in the world,"" he said, ""we spend 2 1/2 times more than the average. Of the country that spends the second most per capita, Switzerland, we spend 175 percent more."" 
Dewhurst didn't respond to our requests for back-up on his statement, which was similar to a remark he made to the Texas Tribune in May. 
Seeking authoritative international perspective, we turned to health statistics from the Organization for Economical Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group that represents 32 advanced, industrialized nations, mostly in Europe, Asia and North America. 
Though experts warned PolitiFact that there are variations from country to country in how statistics are reported, the OECD's data is widely considered the most reliable way to compare the U.S. to its international peers on a variety of economic and social metrics. 
We found a table comparing total health costs per capita of 31 OECD countries, plus three more — Estonia, Israel, Slovenia — that were awaiting admission to the OECD at the time the data was released, on June 29. (Slovenia has since made the cut.) 
The OECD's most recent figures, for 2006-2008 (the year varies by country), shows the U.S. spent the most: $7,538 per person. Norway had the second highest cost per person, at $5,003, followed by Switzerland ($4,627). Turkey spent the least — $767 per capita. The only other countries where per capita health care expenditures exceeded $4,000 were Luxembourg and Canada. 
This isn't a new No. 1 for the United States. We reviewed the OECD's statistics for the past two decades; the United States leads in spending each year. In 1990, we spent $2,810 per person, followed by Switzerland ($2,028) and Germany ($1,764). The OECD's data starts in 1960, when the United States was second in health care costs per capita at $148 to Switzerland's $166. 
As of late, the average health care cost per capita of all OECD countries: $3,000. 
So Dewhurst is correct that we spend 2 1/2 times more than the average per capita. However, the statistics suggest, Switzerland doesn't spend the second most per capita — Norway does. Another departure from Dewhurst's statement: we only spend about 50 percent more than Norway and 63 percent more than Switzerland, not 175 percent more, as Dewhurst says. 
Dewhurst was speaking off the cuff; perhaps he meant to say that we spend 175 percent of Switzerland's health care costs per capita, which translates into spending 75 percent more — much closer to the 63 percent figure. 
PolitiFact.com in Washington covered similar ground in March when it rated True former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's statement that ""the lifespan of the average American is less than that of people in nations that spend far less"" on health care. ""To put it bluntly, we spend more and die sooner,"" Romney said. 
Recap: As far as we can tell — and keeping in mind that Dewhurst didn't respond to our queries for backup — he was spot-on in saying the United States spends more money on health care per capita than the rest of the world, and he's right that we spend two-and-a-half times more than the average cost of all the OECD countries. He erred in his Switzerland comparison. 
We rate his statement as Half True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/31/david-dewhurst/lt-gov-david-dewhurst-says-united-states-spends-mo/

Caprio says 1 in 4 Rhode Islanders don't have health insurance
","
If you live in Rhode Island and you pay any attention to politics, by now you’ve probably heard gubernatorial candidate Frank Caprio talk about his ""small business plan for Rhode Island."" It's on his website, in his speeches, and explained in glossy fliers he passes out to voters. At political events, he encourages audiences to check out his ideas on his website.

You don't have to ask us twice. PolitiFact has previously questioned a main component of Caprio's jobs strategy: that if every small business created one new job, unemployment would be cut in half. We found that statement Half True.

Now we've spotted another claim worth checking within his small business strategy. In telling voters how he'll make health insurance more affordable for small business owners, he says  repeatedly, in campaign material and in person, that ""1 in 4 Rhode Islanders under the age of 65 does not have health insurance.""

(Those 65 and older are not included in the tallies because they have health insurance through the federal Medicare program.)

The Caprio campaign said it got its numbers from two sources. The first was a report issued this spring by Mathematica Policy Research Inc. from its Washington, D.C. office. Conducted at the request of Rhode Island Health Insurance Commissioner Christopher Koller and Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Roberts, the study was financed by the Rhode Island Foundation.

Caprio's team noted that the analysis found that 187,000 Rhode Islanders, 21 percent -- or about 1 in 5 -- are projected to be uninsured at some point during the year. That might mean, for example, that someone loses his or her job and goes uninsured for a few months.

The campaign said it also relied on numbers from a 2009 U.S. Senate Democratic Policy Committee report on Rhode Island. That study, issued in the heat of the health-care debate last summer, found that 27.8 percent of Rhode Islanders ""went without health insurance for some period of time,"" in 2007 and 2008. To reach that tally, it used data from Families USA, a liberal health-care advocacy organization that looks at state-by-state information.

Caprio spokesman Nick Hemond said the campaign took both figures ––  21 percent and 27.8 percent –– and averaged them to get the 1 in 4 statistic.

We did our own digging. For starters, we elected to steer clear of the second report Caprio talks about, the one by the Senate Democratic committee. We prefer to avoid research conducted by overtly political organizations, so as not to get caught up in partisan squabbling.

We then consulted Koller, who was appointed by Governor Carcieri, a Republican, and confirmed by the Democrat-controlled legislature. He said that the most up-to-date report on the matter was the first report Caprio cites, the one issued this spring, by Mathematica.

While it's true that study finds that 187,000 Rhode Islanders are likely to be uninsured at some point during the year, it also found that 140,000 people were uninsured in March, the month the report was issued.

We think that's the more accurate number because it offers a better snapshot of how many Rhode Islanders have no insurance on an average day. And because Caprio never specified that he was referring to people who were uninsured at some point in the year, we believe voters too will interpret his statement as an average.

The most recent Census estimate for Rhode Island's population is 1.05 million. Using those figures, Mathematica projects the number of people younger than 65 to be 889,000 in 2010. That would mean the 140,000 uninsured make up 16 percent of that population. That's 1 in 6.25 Rhode Islanders, not 1 in 4, as Caprio suggests. 

But we were curious if there was more complete data to be had, so we asked Koller.

The Mathematica report ""is the best [data] we’ve got,"" he told us. It was calculated using Census figures on the uninsured. When examined on their own, such Census numbers can be somewhat inconsistent because of Rhode Island's small sample size. But researchers combined those numbers with the state’s unemployment figures to generate a more precise estimate. Koller said that method is common in other states.

He stands by the report's results, reiterating that they are the most accurate he's seen in Rhode Island in quite some time.

That's not a perfect answer, but it's the best we could find.

Now back to Frank Caprio's statement that 1 in 4 Rhode Islanders don't have health insurance. That's a sizable difference from the Mathematica 1 in 6 finding.

If you think we’re being too fussy, consider that the Mathematica study estimates that 140,000 Rhode Islanders have no health insurance. Use Caprio’s estimate and that number jumps to more than 220,000 people. That’s a difference of more than 80,000, about the size of the population of Cranston.

Small percentage differences matter.

Because Koller and other officials can’t say with absolute certainty just how many Rhode Islanders are uninsured, we’ll give Caprio a bit of leeway and call his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/31/frank-caprio/caprio-says-1-4-rhode-islanders-dont-have-health-i/

Ron Klein says Allen West late on paying bills
","Primary election night was barely over when U.S. Rep. Ron Klein released his first general-election campaign ad against Republican challenger Allen West in the heated race for Florida’s 22nd congressional district.

In the 30-second TV spot, Klein juxtaposes a video clip of West at a public appearance talking about ""individual responsibility and accountability,"" with claims that West has faced numerous liens for unpaid taxes. (Check out the ad here.) ""The IRS filed an $11,000 lien against West for back taxes."" In the ad, West says: ""Individual responsibility and accountability is the No. 1 cultural problem we have in America.""  A narrator then says: ""If so, then Allen West is part of the problem."" The ad goes on to list the following claims against West: We decided to check out all three claims, but focused most of our attention on the $11,000 lien. Not only was it the largest debt listed, but it was the one charge that West’s camp immediately challenged. The other two have not been refuted by West campaign manager Josh Grodin in interviews withMiami Herald political reporter Amy Sherman. We asked Klein’s camp to provide us with documentation supporting their claim, and they provided us with a copy of an IRS Notice of Federal Tax Lien filed against ""Allen B West & Angela M Graham West."" The document, filed on Nov. 17, 2005, with the Marion County Recorder’s office in Indianapolis shows an ""Unpaid Balance of Assessment"" for $11,081.05.

The Marion County Recorder’s office was able to provide us copies of the same document, showing the lien was against the couple’s personal income, not against a home. The recorder’s office also provided a copy of an IRS Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien issued to the couple on March 22, 2006, about four months later. The certificate shows that the lien was removed following a payment on the complete balance of the lien.

Almost immediately after the ad was released, Grodin released the following statement: ""Allen West, and his wife Dr. Angela M. Graham-West have never resided, nor owned property in Marion County, Ind., and there was never a valid IRS lien placed upon them.""

Still, West’s residency or whether he owned property in Indiana was not in question, since the lien was not against a property but the couple’s personal income. The paperwork was filed in Indianapolis because the IRS paperwork lists West’s address as ""DFAS-IN"", which stands for the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, based in Indianapolis. DFAS handles military payroll for servicemen like West, who is a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel.

Grodin said West was working in Afghanistan at the time, training Afghan soldiers as a private contractor.

West’s campaign said that they would release documents proving that the IRS lien was an error, but later backtracked. Grodin told The Palm Beach Post on Aug. 26, 2010: ""I spoke a little too soon as far as having all the documents. I jumped the gun. I’m still confident that was a mistake by the IRS.""

As for the other claims listed in the advertisement -- liens being placed against West’s home and being ordered by a judge to pay more than $5,000 in credit charges -- we checked court and county tax records for proof of those claims.

West had the following liens placed on his Plantation, Fla., home according to documents from the Broward County Records, Taxes and Treasury Division. The liens -- we found five, not three as the ad says -- were brought forward by his Homeowner’s Association (Fountain Spring Master Homeowners Association, Inc., and Fountain Spring II Homeowners Association, Inc.). We list them according to the date they were filed with the Broward County Clerk of Courts, and subsequently when they were paid off.

May 5, 2010 - $964.50 for overdue maintenance fees and attorney costs.
                         * lien released on June 22, 2010
March 13, 2009 - $611.66 for overdue maintenance fees and attorney costs.
                          * no release record found on file
Feb. 19, 2007- $995.00 for overdue maintenance fees and late charges.
                          * lien released on March 30, 2007
Sept. 14, 2004 - $295.00 for overdue maintenance fees and late charges.
                           * lien released on Nov. 16, 2004
Sept. 7, 2004 - $366.00 overdue maintenance fees, late charges and attorney fees
                          * lien released on Sept. 13, 2004

On the credit card issue, according to documents from the Broward County Clerk of Courts and the Broward County Tax Collector’s Office, a judge ordered West to pay $5,541.43 on Sept. 1, 2006, to American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. On June 12, 2009, he was ordered to pay $ 2,832.26 to Midland Funding LLC, a representative of Citibank.

We searched Broward County records for ""Satisfaction of Judgment"" documents that normally indicate a debt has been paid in full, but none came up. However, that does not automatically mean the debt hasn’t been paid, even though those documents are not on file, said Lloyd Comiter, an attorney who serves as the chairman of the Palm Beach County Bar Association’s small claims committee.

""Just because there is no Satisfaction of Judgment on file, it doesn’t necessarily mean it hasn’t been paid,"" Comiter said. ""As an attorney, if my client paid their full judgment I would make sure to file the Satisfaction of Judgment so it’s recorded. But there are cases where people do not.""

West campaign manager Grodin said that the candidate’s financial woes stemmed from his time overseas. He gave this explanation on Aug. 25 in an interview posted on the Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog: ""Allen West was serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. [His wife] Angela was putting herself through grad school and caring for two young daughters. Like countless young families, the Wests found themselves with a financial burden.""

West himself released the following statement on Aug. 26, 2010, regarding his finances, acknowledging struggling with ""financial hardship.""

""...like many of you, my family has struggled with financial hardship,"" West wrote. "" And also like many of you, we have honestly resolved every issue, and both my wife and I are working hard every day to honor all of our obligations, while ensuring our daughters' future."" So back to the question: Did the IRS file ""an $11,000 lien against West for back taxes"" as Klein’s ad states? It's important to remember that income tax records are private and we won't know what the IRS dispute involved. West says the lien was filed in error, but his campaign isn't able to provide us with any documentation showing that. If the campaign offers it later, we will review this item then. What we do know is that an IRS lien was filed, so Klein's ad is accurate on that score. The Broward liens and the credit card accusations also are accurate descriptions of public records. But we think the ad lacks context because Klein fails to mention that the IRS lien was settled within a few months, as were most of the other judgments filed in Broward County. So we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/30/ron-klein/ron-klien-says-allen-west-late-paying-bills/

Ann Marie Buerkle, GOP candidate, says under new health law, feds will track Americans' body mass index
","
It sounds like a claim from a chain e-mail, but it's posted on the website of a Republican candidate for Congress. Is Big Brother really going to keep tabs on your flab?

The charge was posted in a letter dated Aug. 10, 2010, on the website of Ann Marie Buerkle, a Republican who is seeking to oust Rep. Dan Maffei, a freshman Democrat representing a district in upstate New York.

The letter, addressed to ""Dear Friends,"" was signed by the candidate herself. It said, ""You may have noticed the latest 'product' from big government advocates in Washington. We now know the Obama Health and Human Services Department is planning to compile a federal health record on all U.S. citizens by 2014, and will include information on each individual’s Body Mass Index in the files. Some argue that an individual’s Body Mass Index indicates whether that person is dieting and exercising properly. We may all prefer healthy life styles, but I don’t believe the federal government needs to be involved in such personal matters. Instead, I advocate personal accountability and personal responsibility.""

Buerkle -- who describes herself on her campaign website as a ""nurse and accomplished attorney working in health care,"" added, ""I believe this is an unacceptable intrusion by government into the private lives of Americans. It is costly, and susceptible to abuse. As the financial burden and unbearable strain of Obamacare has started to take its toll on healthcare costs, such information like BMI can eventually be used to help government bureaucrats to ration health care.  Even if that’s not the case, I’m opposed to the expansion of federal bureaucracies, out-of-control spending, tax increases, and increasing dependency on government.""

We wondered whether the federal government is really planning to snoop on people's body mass index, which, in certain ranges, can be a predictor of costly, debilitating and even deadly diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.

As we first related in a fact-check in October 2009, computerizing medical records has long been a goal of policymakers across the ideological spectrum. The idea is to shift from paper-based records to electronic ones, so that doctors can access information about patients more quickly and easily and make better clinical decisions as a result. Supporters hope that electronic medical records will reduce the frequency of medical errors, unnecessary diagnostic tests and inappropriate treatments. They also hope that, in the long term, streamlining record-keeping could bring down the rapidly escalating cost of health care.

The effort did not begin with President Barack Obama. In 2004, President George W. Bush issued an executive order creating incentives for the adoption of information technology by 2014, to be spearheaded by a new federal official, the national coordinator for Health Information Technology. Under Obama, Congress passed his economic stimulus package in February 2009. The stimulus included several items designed to promote health information technology, including $19 billion over four years to fund electronic infrastructure improvements and the widespread adoption of electronic health records by providers, typically through higher Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements for doctors who use electronic medical records effectively.

The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology describes the Nationwide Health Information Network as a ""network of networks."" All the experts we spoke to emphasized that it is not a single database residing at, say, a federal agency. It's more accurately viewed as a network to link many separate databases where records already exist, such as regional databases or medical offices, along with efforts to establish common technical standards so that these far-flung repositories of data can exchange information as needed.

So will an intrusive government will have access to your private medical information? The short answer is: No.

""The records would be held by physicians and providers -- there is no such 'federal health record' on all Americans being compiled by the government,"" said Deven McGraw, director of the health privacy project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a group that follows electronic privacy issues. The Department of Health and Human Services ""is not establishing a record for each person -- they are administering a program whereby physicians and hospitals can establish electronic medical records for their patients.""

In July 2010, HHS issued its first in a series of final regulations on how the incentive program for medical professionals will work, covering 2011 and 2012. Among other things, doctors will have to record body mass index as one of a number of statistics included in the new electronic medical record. (Click here to see a summary of the full list.) ""This information is going into the physician or hospital's medical record, where it is considered confidential and subject to ethical and legal protections against inappropriate use and disclosure,"" McGraw said. ""It is not information going into a government record.""

So, doctors have to track body mass index on the new electronic forms and report adult weight data to the government in order to receive their incentive payments. Why isn't Buerkle right? Because providers will be reporting information on patients' vital statistics only in aggregate, not with any personal identification attached. So while the federal government will have a new, large data set on Americans' weight, it will not know who weighs how much.

""I question how the government could obtain information -- let alone current information -- on BMI or other health status of everyone even if there was a desire to do so,"" said Marty Robins, an Illinois-based attorney and adjunct law professor at Northwestern and DePaul universities who has expressed concerns about how safe electronic records will be from hackers.

When we showed Buerkle's letter to HHS, spokeswoman Jessica Santillo called the allegations ""false."" Meanwhile, Glenn Laffel, senior vice president for clinical affairs at Practice Fusion, a company that helps doctors conform to electronic medical records regulations, calls Buerkle's charge ""hogwash.""

""The federal government has legitimate concerns about the obesity epidemic in this country because this condition increases Medicare and Medicaid expenditures,"" Laffel said. ""But its efforts to deal with the crisis don’t include anything like the assertions being made"" in Buerkle's letter. 
Pamela Snyder, Buerkle's campaign manager, said the campaign stands by the letter. For starters, Snyder said in an e-mail, the information in these files may be subject to unauthorized access or hacking, potentially making them accessible ""not simply a doctor and patient, but by health plans, hospitals, other doctors, pharmacies, insurance payors and government regulators."" In the campaign's view, she said, ""there are extremely serious privacy issues involved.""
 
On that point, few would disagree. Indeed, this question has prompted much interest -- and legislative and regulatory activity. But while the experts we spoke to were among those expressing concerns about privacy and security, they didn't interpret Buerkle's letter as focusing on privacy concerns. We don't either. While the letter does mention in passing that the system is ""susceptible to abuse,"" Buerkle's letter discusses in much greater detail, and much more forceful language, about a federal bureaucracy that is intruding too deeply into Americans' private lives.
 
Snyder also said the campaign ""never stated that the (electronic health records) would be compiled in a government file -- only that the government was moving to make sure those files were compiled and contained certain information."" We think that this more restrained interpretation -- which is pretty close to accurate -- is undermined by Buerkle's own words, including such phrases as ""big government,"" ""unacceptable intrusion by government into the private lives of Americans"" and ""expansion of federal bureaucracies."" We believe a reasonable person would infer that when Buerkle says that ""the Obama Health and Human Services Department is planning to compile a federal health record on all U.S. citizens by 2014,"" including ""each individual’s Body Mass Index,"" she means that federal officials will have access to each person's BMI. 
That is not at all what is envisioned. As a result, we rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2010/aug/30/ann-marie-buerkle/ann-marie-buerkle-gop-candidate-says-under-new-hea/
"['State Budget', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott says 50 state employees are paid to lobby the state
","
Newly minted Republican nominee for governor Rick Scott is making the rounds on national television promoting his plan to cut state taxes and spending.

On MSNBC's The Daily Rundown on Aug. 26, 2010 -- two days after his defeat of rival Bill McCollum -- Scott faced questions from host Chuck Todd about whether the major tax and spending cuts he has suggested are realistic given Florida's budget structure and current tax policy. Todd correctly noted that the state budget has been crafted by Republicans for the last 12 years.

Todd, who grew up in Miami, then tried to get Scott to zero in on some specific program that could be cut. ""It's a pretty lean and mean government, is it not?"" Todd asked.

""No,"" replied Scott. ""We have a $70 billion budget. We're not going back and looking at how we spend everything. And for example, we have 50 state lobbyists that just lobby the Legislature for money every year. That's not what state governments ought to be doing.""

We were intrigued by Scott's specific example of government excess -- his claim about the 50 state lobbyists who ""just lobby the Legislature for money every year.""

So we decided to check it out.

Anyone who lobbies the Legislature is required to register with the state, so we started by going to the Florida Legislature's lobbyist directory. State statutes define a ""lobbyist"" as a ""person who is employed and receives payment, or who contracts for economic consideration, for the purpose of lobbying, or a person who is principally employed for governmental affairs by another person or governmental entity to lobby on behalf of that other person or governmental entity.""

The same statutes define ""lobbying"" as ""influencing or attempting to influence legislative action or nonaction through oral or written communication or an attempt to obtain the goodwill of a member or employee of the Legislature.""

The definitions could catch a lot of state employees who talk policy or budget with the Legislature on behalf of their agency or department. And when we searched through the 2010 registered lobbyist list, that's exactly what we found.

We counted more than 200 state employees who have been registered as lobbyists by the Legislature.

A few examples: 
In total, the list includes way more than the 50 state employees Scott claimed on MSNBC.

But as we looked at the list, many of the state employees aren't lobbyists in the traditional sense -- meaning that they only lobby the Legislature.

We went to the Executive Office of the Governor -- the formal title for Gov. Charlie Crist's office -- to examine the issue in a little more detail. Crist's office includes 40 registered lobbyists, according to the directory.

The list includes many employees who work in the Governor's Office of Policy and Budget, the arm of the state executive branch that crafts and reacts to policy proposals and drafts a state budget. Put simply, the governor's sausage makers.

That list includes John Mitchell (environmental policy), Jasmin Raffington (transportation and economic development policy), Christian Weiss (economic analysis) and Randy Ball (public safety policy). Then there are folks like Bruce Grant of the Office of Drug Control, JoAnn Carrin of the Office of Open Government, Lucia Fishburne of the Office of Film and Entertainment, and Chris Hart of Office of Tourism, Trade, and Economic Development.

And then there's Crist's executive team, which includes chief of staff Shane Strum, and deputy chiefs of staff Ken Granger, Chuck Drago and Jerry McDaniel.

""Most of our staff discuss policy before legislative committees and (are) not necessarily there to lobby for money,"" said governor's office spokesman Sterling Ivey. Later, Ivey added that the governor's office ""does not have an employee whose only job is to lobby the Legislature. Anyone lobbying or appearing before committees would have other primary job responsibilities and appearance before the legislature would be a secondary part of their job.""

All that information left us skeptics. On one hand, Scott's number was awfully low. And also, it seems misleading because it's labeling employees as lobbyists when they get that title more by technicality.

So we turned to the Scott campaign for clarity.

The campaign provided us with this spreadsheet, which wasn't really clear at all until we got a more detailed explanation. In short, the Scott campaign created a subset of those 200-plus lobbyists, specifically those whose primary or sole responsibility is to work with the Legislature. For many agencies, these positions are often called ""Legislative Affairs Director"" or something like that.

With that information, we started doing our own research.

Take, for instance, the Agency for Health Care Administration. The agency has its own Legislative Affairs Office, which ""serves as the Agency resource for statutory interaction,"" according to the AHCA website. ""It provides information to legislators and the public about health care legislation. The office also acts as liaison between AHCA staff, legislators, legislative committee staff and industry interests.""

The office employs three people -- Warren Moore, Jim Alfred and Ashley James -- all of them registered to lobby before the Legislature.

Then we searched around the other departments and agencies in Tallahassee.

The Florida Department of Environmental Protection has a legislative affairs office, which ""includes developing legislation and support information, and finding sponsors for legislation. The Office also serves as the central point of contact for legislators and their staffs for information about the Department's programs,"" according to its website.

The office is headed by Cameron Cooper, who is registered to lobby the Legislature. Grace Lovett is a registered lobbyist and the office's deputy director.

The Department of Corrections has three people in its legislative affairs office -- Jason Welty, Tommy Maggitas, Kristen Manalo –- registered to lobby. Rivers H. Buford is the legislative affairs director for the Department of State. Kimberly Case is the legislative affairs director for the Attorney General's office.

It turns out most agencies and departments have their own legislative point person.

Jim Henry, a registered lobbyist, is the legislative affairs director for the Department of Children and Families. Sunny Phillips at the Department of Community Affairs. Two slots at the Department of Juvenile Justice -- one for Sarah Toms and a vacant director position.

The Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation has a legislative director and three legislative affairs coordinators. Three of the four are registered to lobby before the Legislature. There is a director and a deputy director in the legislative affairs office of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

The Department of Elder Affairs has a legislative affairs director. So does CFO Alex Sink's Department of Financial Services. So does the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Department of Highway Safety & Motor Vehicles has a legislative affairs administrator. The Department of Health has a legislative planning director. The Agency For Workforce Innovation also has a legislative affairs position.

The Department of Management Services has a director and deputy director of legislative affairs. Both are registered to lobby. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has a Legislative, External & Cabinet Affairs Director who is registered to lobby. The Department of Education has an office of governmental relations. Its director is registered to lobby in Florida. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has a legislative affairs office with a director and legislative liaison who are both registered to lobby.

The Department of Health employs a director of legislative planning and a deputy secretary for advocacy and policy, both who are registered to lobby.

The Department of Revenue has an office of Legislative and Cabinet Services. We found at least two people in the office who are registered lobbyists. The Department of the Lottery has a director of legislative affairs and a senior legislative analyst who are both registered to lobby.

That's 37 people we found in a few hours searching who are registered lobbyists for state agencies and departments whose primary responsibility is dealing with the Legislature. And we admit we're likely overlooking some employees at the state department and agency level.

Then there are the college and university lobbyists -- technically state employees -- who also lobby the Legislature.

The University of Florida employs a director of government relations and an associate vice president of government relations. Both are registered to lobby the Legislature.

The University of Central Florida has a director of governmental relations. So does the University of West Florida. The University of North Florida has a vice president for governmental relations. Even non-universities have full-time lobbyists. St. Petersburg College has a government relations director. As does Palm Beach State College. And Miami-Dade College, Valencia Community College, Daytona State College, Edison State College, Pensacola Junior College, and Seminole State College.

That's another 13 people, or 50 all together, and again that most likely is just a partial list. 
(For the record, state law says departments and colleges  ""may not use public funds to retain a lobbyist to represent it before the legislative or executive branch."" However, full time department and college employees ""may register as lobbyists and represent that employer before the legislative or executive branch."" In other words, the state lobbyist must also be a full time department or college employee). 
Scott's number is credible. There are at least 50 state employees whose primary responsibility is to lobby the state Legislature. But Scott also said that they ""just lobby"" for money.

That's not true. While lobbyists will no doubt support the budget requests of their specific agency, department or university, they also spend significant time lobbying for policy, and they act as a point person for legislators looking for information about a specific program. It's more than just money, though money is a part of it.

For instance, here's how the Department of State's Office of Legislative Affairs describes itself:

""The office ... supervises and coordinates the Department's legislative agenda and identifies needed legislation; drafts proposed bills; identifies bill sponsors; tracks departmental legislation and other filed legislation that will potentially impact, positively or negatively, the Department's programs. This information is then used to help educate the Legislature, other state agencies, the Governor's Office and the public to understand how these proposals impact the department's legislative and budgetary goals and objectives. The unit also takes the lead with constituent issues generated by legislative offices that affect the department.""

Which brings us back to Scott's claim. In a national television interview, Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott said that Florida has ""50 state lobbyists that just lobby the Legislature for money every year."" There are more than 200 state employees registered as lobbyists in Tallahassee to advocate either for policy or money. And there are at least 50 of them whose primary job is work with the Legislature. But they do more than lobby just for money as Scott suggested.

Beck claims U.S. on track for second-biggest deficit in 65 years
","Vice President Joe Biden talks a lot about the success of the government's economic policies, but not everybody is persuaded. Reacting to Biden's Aug. 24, 2010, statement that ""we are turning this great ship of state around,"" TV host Glenn Beck pointed to the country's dire fiscal situation.

""Remember, Joe Biden says no doubt we're headed in the right direction on the economy. Well, we're just getting started with the news of the day. How about this one? Unemployment 9.6 percent. The real unemployment number is 16.5 for July. The federal government is now on track for the second-largest budget shortfall in 65 years, 9.1 of GDP. And in 31 months, Congress has added $4.4 trillion to the 10-year spending baseline. Who's going to lend us more money?"" Beck said on his Aug. 25, 2010, show.

In this item, we'll focus on the claim that the federal government ""is now on track for the second-largest budget shortfall in 65 years.""

We turned to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the official scorekeeper for Congress. Its most recent estimates, published in August 2010, indicate that in 2010, the federal deficit will exceed $1.3 trillion. As a percentage of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product -- the value of the goods and services that the economy produces -- that's 9.1 percent, as Beck said. How does that compare with previous years? We checked data going back to 1930 from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a government agency that helps prepare the president's annual budget. Only in 2009 and in the war years 1942, 1943, 1944 and 1945 was the deficit-to-GDP ratio higher than 9.1 percent, according to the OMB. But going back 65 years only takes you to 1946, so that would put 2010 on track to be the second-highest, according to CBO's figures.

The CBO and the OMB have slightly different projections for the 2010 deficit, with the CBO's being the more recent. The discrepancy arises from differences in the agencies' projections of future economic conditions and the impact of legislation enacted after the OMB completed its estimates. OMB projected in July that the 2010 deficit will be 10.6 percent of GDP. That would make it the biggest in 65 years -- not the second biggest. But looking back 65 years and using the CBO's estimate, as Beck did, the deficit was higher as a percentage of GDP only in 2009, when it stood at 9.9 percent.

We thought it would be valuable to explore the reasons behind the current deficit as well as the projected deficits over the next decade. We spoke to a number of economists and found that they offer different explanations.

Brian Riedl, a budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us via e-mail that the main drivers of today's deficit are the ongoing economic downturn, which has reduced government revenues, and the policies that the government has enacted in response to the crisis. ""Recession automatically reduces revenues and increases unemployment and antipoverty spending, even if Congress does nothing. At the same time, we have enacted $1 trillion in stimulus spending, plus TARP, Fannie/Freddie bailouts, and large discretionary spending hikes. So enacted policies are certainly a contributor,"" Riedl wrote.

The CBO provided a similar explanation. ""This year’s deficit is attributable in large part to a combination of weak revenues and elevated spending associated with the economic downturn and the policies implemented in response to it.""

Speaking about future projections, Riedl wrote that future deficits are likely to remain well over a trillion due to ""runaway government spending.""

Kathy Ruffing, a senior policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, emphasized that even before President Barack Obama took office, the CBO had already projected that the 2009 deficit would exceed $1 trillion. The 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan accounted for over $500 billion of that, she wrote on June 28, 2010. Riedl, however, disagrees. ""Both recent and future budget deficits have been blamed largely on the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and to a lesser extent on the war on terrorism, but the data contradict these myths. In reality, spending is almost exclusively the problem,"" he wrote in a June 2010 report.

Finally, Chris Dreibelbis, the outreach and public liaison for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan Washington, D.C., think tank, pointed to the recession and the policy responses to it as the ""main culprits"" in the current deficit. ""Going forward, the structural problems that were there before the recession will combine with the growth in spending from an aging population and health care costs, to cause large and ongoing deficits even once the economy recovers,"" he wrote us in an e-mail.

So let's review. Beck said that we're on track to have the second-biggest budget deficit in 65 years. According to the Congressional Budget Office, he's right. Going by the administration's own estimate, the situation is even more dire. We found disagreement among economists as to why the deficits are soaring, but Beck's point stands, so we rate this True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/30/glenn-beck/beck-claims-us-track-second-biggest-deficit-65-yea/
"['Ohio', 'Campaign Finance', 'Elections', 'Mike DeWine']","
Mike DeWine says Attorney General Richard Cordray’s campaign is funded “almost exclusively” by party, labor unions and special counsels
","
One notion that Democrats in Ohio and elsewhere haven’t been able to shake over the last generation or so is that their campaigns are funded by cigar-puffing party big wigs and labor bosses.

In the race to become Ohio’s next Attorney General, Republican candidate Mike DeWine played up to just this kind of stereotype during an interview with ONN anchor Jim Heath on the Aug. 15 edition of Capitol Square. Heath asked DeWine if he was concerned about trailing Democratic Attorney General Richard Cordray in fundraising. Cordray reported he had $3.5 million at the end of July, while DeWine, a former U.S. senator, had $2.1 million.

After explaining that recent campaign finance reports showed the fundraising gap narrowing, DeWine turned the focus back onto Cordray, insinuating that he is a tool of the Democratic party and labor union bosses with a much narrower base of support.

""The good thing I think is that we are receiving money from so many more people,"" DeWine said. ""His (Cordray) money is coming almost exclusively from the party, labor unions, and special counsel that he has given business to.""

Surely, Cordray has received donations from the state party, labor unions and lawyers who got special contracts that are routinely doled out by the attorney general’s office. But is it ""almost exclusively"" from those sources? And can DeWine really lay claim to a much broader grassroots fundraising base?

It sounded like a perfect job for PolitiFact, so we rolled up our sleeves, printed out a stack of campaign finance reports from 2009 and 2010 and got to work with multiple highlighters at the ready.

The easiest part to figure out was the total number of donations each candidate received. DeWine was absolutely right about getting money from ""so many more people."" He got 4,811 individual donations compared to 1,529 for Cordray through the July 2010 reporting period. Clearly, DeWine has a much wider donation base.

This is fueled in part by DeWine having a lot more micro-donors — the Republican had 428 people who gave $10 bucks or less while Cordray only had 43 in the last two years.

Overall, Cordray has raised about $3.28 million, with the biggest single source coming from money from county and state parties which totals about $1.25 million—about 38 percent of his fundraising total. Most of that $1.25 million came from the state party coffers which kicked in about $1.15 million.  

And -- just as DeWine had surmised on the television program -- labor unions accounted for another big chunk of change. Cordray has received about $500,000 from Big Labor—which works out to be about 15 percent of his $3.28 million pile.  

The trickiest part was to try to figure out how many folks who got special counsel contracts from Cordray’s office also gave money to his campaign. To figure this out, we asked the attorney general’s office for a list of lawyers with special counsel contracts, as well as those approved to do collections for his office.

It turns out that a number of firms with contracts did contribute — a total of almost $195,000 by our count — or about 6 percent of what Cordray has raised. (To be fair, a number of folks with special counsel contracts haven’t given anything at all to Cordray.) Leading the way are the attorneys for Calfee, Halter & Griswold. Employees from that Cleveland-based firm have donated $24,350.

Calfee, Halter & Griswold has contracts that could be worth up to $1.13 million working primarily on patent matters for Cleveland State University, Ohio State University, Ohio University, Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine as well as the Department of Development.

Add it up and here’s what you get: State and county Democratic Party accounts, labor unions and law firms with special contracts gave about 60 percent of the money raised by Cordray during this election cycle. That’s a clear majority of the dollars raised by Cordray but a far cry from ""almost exclusively"" providing the funds, as DeWine had claimed.

So while DeWine was absolutely right in saying that he has a wider base, he missed the mark in claiming that Cordray’s dough came ""almost exclusively"" from a trio of sources.

As a result, we rate his claim to be Half True.

Nathan Deal makes statements about mosque near Ground Zero
","
The site for a proposed mosque near ground zero in New York may be more than 800 miles away, but that doesn't mean Georgia politicians are detached from the controversy.

In an Aug. 19 article in The Marietta Daily Journal, candidates lined up to denounce its construction two blocks away from the scene of the Sept. 11 attack.

Democratic nominee for governor Roy Barnes said it is too ""painful and divisive"" to build a mosque there. Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson called it ""insensitive and inappropriate."" Mike Crane, a Republican running for Congress, said it was ""not appropriate, decent or honorable.""  

Republican gubernatorial nominee Nathan Deal said this: ""As governor, I don't want New Yorkers telling Georgians what to do with our land. I'll return the favor by staying out of their business.""

""Candidates differ on mosque near 9/11 site,"" the Daily Journal's headline concluded.

That afternoon, The Associated Press posted an article with a different headline: ""Barnes, Deal oppose mosque near ground zero."" Deal called the mosque ""an insult.""

Did Deal change his opinion on the mosque?

AJC PolitiFact Georgia switched on our trusty Flip-O-Meter, which measures whether a politician's position has shifted.

Deal's opinion never wavered, his spokesman Brian Robinson said. As a candidate, he knows New York's decision is outside his purview. As an American, he finds it offensive. 

What Deal told the AP was simply more comprehensive than the view he expressed to The Marietta Daily Journal, Robinson said. 

To verify Robinson's assertion, we reviewed Deal's public statements and contacted Daily Journal reporter Jon Gillooly, who wrote the article.

AJC PolitiFact Georgia searched for public statements by Deal on the mosque prior to the Marietta article. We found none.

After the article ran, Deal made statements to the AP and WABE, Atlanta's public radio affiliate.

Neither news outlet treated Deal's statements as a shift in his position. Both said his statements ""went further"" than those he made to the Daily Journal.  

When we approached Gillooly, he gave us a copy of his e-mail exchange with Robinson. He also described how he reported the story and the Deal camp's response to it.

On Aug. 18, Gillooly e-mailed politicians asking what they thought of the mosque. The poll asked three questions:

""Do you think a mosque should be allowed near Ground Zero?"", ""Why or why not?"", ""What’s the alternative?""

Robinson and Gillooly confirmed the following:

Robinson replied to the e-mail with Deal's two-sentence response. Gillooly did not ask a follow-up question. The paper printed the quote in its entirety Aug 19.

That day, Robinson complained about the headline's use of the word ""differ."" He also asked whether Deal could expand on his statement for the online version of the story.

The paper declined to change the article and gave Deal an opportunity to write a letter to the editor. Robinson said he didn't take the paper up on its offer.

That afternoon, The Associated Press sent out its own story on the subject: ""Barnes, Deal oppose NYC mosque.""   

Deal said that as ""a potential governor of the state of Georgia"" he didn't have a say in what happens in New York.

""I don't think government officials from one place should be telling government officials from someplace else what they ought to be doing,"" the Gainesville Republican said.

""But as an American, I am absolutely opposed,"" Deal said. He called construction of the mosque two blocks from where the World Trade Center once stood ""an insult.""

""It keeps the wounds of 9/11 alive,"" Deal said.

Deal made a similar comment to WABE.

So did Deal give an incomplete airing of his thoughts to the Marietta newspaper? Or did he actually switch positions?

Although Deal's statements to The Marietta Daily Journal, Associated Press and WABE aren't identical, there is no evidence his opinion actually changed.  
There is also no indication he supported the mosque, or held no personal opinion on the mosque, prior to his interview with the Daily Journal.

Plus, it's possible for Deal to say without contradiction that, as a governor, he would stay out of New York's business, but personally, he opposes the mosque.

We rule there was no significant change in Deal's position. In other words, No Flip.",/factchecks/2010/aug/30/nathan-deal/nathan-deal-makes-statements-about-mosque-near-gro/
