No, ICE did not arrest 2,000 undocumented immigrants for murder in 2017
","The Trump administration has faced fierce criticism for the deaths of two Guatemalan children who were in U.S. custody after crossing the border, but some bloggers are urging Americans to consider that number in context.   ""2 foreign children died due to complications resulting from entering the United States ILLEGALLY!"" reads a Dec. 31 Facebook post. ""2,000 illegal aliens were arrested by ICE in 2017 for MURDERS committed here in the United States! The liberal media is SILENT! THINK ABOUT IT!"" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In response to an email asking about the stat, Vincent Picard, a deputy assistant director at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s public affairs office, pointed PolitiFact to the agency’s ""enforcement and removal operations"" report for fiscal year 2018. In a tabulation of the criminal charges and convictions of the people ICE arrested for being in the country illegally that year, the agency lists 2,028 ""total offenses in the homicide column,"" a number that includes 387 charges and 1,641 convictions. But there are several things to note: First, the federal fiscal year started Oct. 1, 2017, and ended Sept. 30, 2018. In fiscal year 2017, which started Oct. 1, 2016, and ended Sept. 30, 2017, there were 1,886 total homicide offenses, according to another ICE report. Second, someone charged with homicide is not necessarily accused of murder. He or she could be accused of manslaughter, the unlawful killing of someone without malice. That could mean killing in the heat of the moment, or accidentally causing someone’s death. Third, these numbers reflect ICE's administrative arrests, meaning the agency's officers arrested the immigrants for a civil violation of U.S. immigration laws, not for murder. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, the 2,028 figure doesn’t represent the number of crimes committed in a given year. ""It also does not refer to 2,028 suspected or convicted criminals,"" said Elizabeth Cohen, a political science professor at Syracuse University. ""It refers to how many times a conviction or suspicion was the reason for arrest. If one person was suspected of five separate crimes, that would contribute five separate times to the overall tally in that table."" Plus, said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute, ""the homicides could have been committed at any time, not in a single year, and there could be multiple homicides per individual arrested."" He also noted that some of the homicide charges may have been dropped, further lowering the number of homicide offenses on arrestees’ records. So how many people were murdered by undocumented immigrants in 2017? ""There is no way to count it because no one keeps track,"" said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies. The answer requires statistical estimations, Cohen said, ""the most reliable of which show that in any given year foreign-born persons commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans."" This Facebook post claims that in 2017, ICE arrested 2,000 undocumented immigrants for murder. The number appears to stem from an ICE report detailing how many immigrants the agency arrested for being in the country illegally in fiscal year 2018. But it is being misinterpreted and misused. According to the report, those arrested for immigration offenses had a combined 2,028 homicide charges and convictions in their records. But those offenses could have been accumulated over many years — not just 2017 — and didn’t necessarily happen the same year ICE arrested these people. In addition, a homicide could be a murder, but it could also be an accidental killing. Finally, ICE didn’t pick any of these folks up for murder; it picked them up for being in violation of the nation’s immigration laws.

Meme way off in claim that the Rothschild family holds '80 percent of the world's wealth'
","Memes pushing an old rumor about the Rothschilds, the influential European banking family, are making the rounds online. The post claims that the family ""holds about 80 percent of the world’s total wealth"" and has the ability to ""literally feed, clothe and settle every man, woman and child on the planet if they wanted to."" It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is true that the Rothschilds are quite wealthy – they have been since the 1700s – but to suggest they are in possession of 80 percent of the world’s wealth is a gross exaggeration. The Rothschilds are a famous, wealthy Jewish banking family from Europe. The family has long been the target of conspiracy theories, and their wealth is largely thought to be responsible for inspiring the anti-Semitic belief that Jews ""control"" the world’s money. (They’ve been wrongly blamed for everything from starting wars to sinking the Titanic to assassinating U.S. presidents.. The family business began in the 1700s in Frankfurt when Mayer Amschel Rothschild became an apprentice at a small bank in Hamburg before returning home to start trading in rare coins. Soon, he began providing financial services for power brokers and, eventually, nobles. Mayer then dispatched each of his five sons to a different European city – London, Paris, Vienna, Naples and Frankfurt – to set up shop. The family’s dealings with various governments and savvy investments paid off handsomely, helping them establish a financial dynasty. While the Rothschilds certainly still have deep pockets, they have produced hundreds of descendants and there is no longer any centralized family wealth, nor does the family have the same kind of global power it did in the 18th and 19th centuries. With no monolithic house, the Rothschild name has connections to a number of independent business ventures and have investments in mining, energy, farming, real estate and winemaking. As the Financial Times once put it, ""The family empire is divided among a web of descendants and a few external shareholders. The ownership structure is opaque, which makes it hard to estimate the family wealth, although it is one of the richest in the world."" The closest thing to a ""Rothschild’s family"" business today is the Rothschild Group, a multinational investment banking company. But the enterprise does not produce nearly enough money to back up the claim that the family controls 80 percent of the world’s money supply. The Rothschild Group's annual revenue was approximately $500 million in 2017 – less than what many corporations make. (Walmart, for example, boasted an annual revenue of about $500 billion in 2018.) In April 2017, the Rothschild’s net worth was estimated by Celebrity Net Worth to be around $400 billion. Aggregate global wealth, for comparison, reached $317 trillion in 2018, according to Credit Suisse Research Institute. That figure comes from an analysis of wealth held by 5 billion adults across the globe, from the least affluent to the wealthiest individuals to arrive at a figure that represents the world’s total household wealth. In 2012, Skeptoid, an award-winning weekly science podcast hosted by writer and producer Brian Andrew Dunning, explored the famous family’s history and noted that while the Rothschild’s are still a looming figure in the banking world, they are still dwarfed by larger, wealthier institutions. ""Make no mistake, it's a large and successful company; but with billions in assets, it's a relatively small fish in the sea of world financial institutions with trillions in assets,"" Dunning said then, ""including Deutsche Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, HSBC Holdings, BNP Paribas, Japan Post Bank, Crédit Agricole Group, Barclays PLC, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, Royal Bank of Scotland Group, JP Morgan Chase & Co., and many others. Anyone trying to point the finger at the scattered Rothschilds as ‘controlling’ world banks has an awfully tall order. That little factoid is about 100 years out of date."" While many Rothschild family members hold massive fortunes, it should also be noted only one made it on Forbes world billionaires list: Swiss banker Benjamin de Rothschild, who comes in at No. 1284 with a net worth of $1.6 billion. A meme recirculating the internet claims the Rothschild family ""holds about 80 percent of the world’s wealth,"" and thus has the ability to ""feed, clothe and settle every man, woman and child"" if they so choose. The family is certainly wealthy but claiming they control 80 percent of the world’s wealth is a tall order. There is no longer any centralized family wealth, with the closest being an investment banking firm. But the firm’s revenues are far less than what many corporations make. The rumor is a baseless exaggeration that furthers the spread of anti-Semitic theories.

Did Democrats reverse border wall position after Donald Trump was elected?
","In his call for a border wall, President Donald Trump said Democrats made a U-turn on immigration after he was elected president. ""Sen. Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats,"" Trump said Jan. 8 in his prime time address on the border wall. ""They changed their mind only after I was elected president."" That’s a mischaracterization of the barrier that won Democratic support 13 years ago. Just over half of Democrats in the Senate voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush, including then-Sens. Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton. Most Democrats in the House voted against it, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi. The law authorized a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the U.S.-Mexico border. By 2015, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had constructed 654 miles of fencing, the Government Accountability Office reported. The fence was different from the wall Trump promised to build on the campaign trail, which he said would be made of ""hardened concrete"" as tall as ""95 stories"" with a ""very big, very beautiful door."" Trump derided the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 campaign — he said it was ""not a wall"" but a ""little fence"" that could be scaled with a ladder. ""Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental — probably a snake was in the way or a toad,"" Trump said. (Actually, the project didn’t face environmental hurdles; we rated that part of the claim Mostly False.) A 2016 Associated Press report from the border described the fencing as ""rust-colored thick bars"" that form ""teeth-like slats."" That includes the steel fence dividing Nogales in Arizona and Mexico, which is between 18 and 26 feet tall. ""There are miles of gaps between segments and openings in the fence itself,"" the AP reported. The Democrats’ offer to Trump is a continuing resolution on last year’s appropriations act, which provided $1.3 billion for fencing and additional money for other types of border security. The language made it so that the funds could only be used on repairing or extending fencing that had already been built under the 2006 law. We’re rated similar statements in which the Trump administration has claimed Democrats wanted a wall as Half True, but here, Trump goes farther. Democrats have not changed their stance on the border fencing they previously supported; they simply don’t support the more ambitious wall Trump proposes. Trump said Schumer has ""has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected president."" Schumer, along with tens of other Democrats including former President Barack Obama, voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. That’s the majority of the barrier in place today along the southern border. However, the fence was mocked as a ""nothing wall"" by Trump in the past and was far less ambitious, both politically and physically, than the wall Trump wants to build now. Finally, Trump says the Democrats no longer support their previous position simply because he wants it. But Democrats have actually proposed current funding for the fencing that was approved in 2006.  We rate this statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/jan/09/donald-trump/trump-democrats-reverse-border-wall-position/

No, Democrats didn't ask for a steel barrier, as Donald Trump said
","The border wall impasse is not over construction materials. But President Donald Trump made it sound that way during his prime time address to the nation. Speaking on the 18th day of a partial government shutdown, Trump claimed he made a concession to the Democrats in his appeal for $5.7 billion for a border wall. ""At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall,"" Trump said Jan. 8. We found no evidence that Democrats requested the wall be made of steel. The White House did not respond to our request for comment. Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s acting chief of staff, however, said during an interview on Meet the Press on Jan. 6 that discussions with Democrats ""never even got to"" the ""definitional conversations"" on the wall, like whether a steel fence may qualify. ""Do we disagree on a wall, or do you really agree that maybe a steel fence qualifies as a fence and not a wall, and we want to build a steel barrier anyway?"" Mulvaney said. In recent weeks, Trump has embraced a version of the wall that’s different from the tall, concrete barrier he campaigned on. ""The Democrats, are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a Concrete Wall - but we are not building a Concrete Wall, we are building artistically designed steel slats, so that you can easily see through it....,"" Trump tweeted on Dec. 18, 2018. We could find no evidence that Democrats ever said they wanted a steel wall. ""Democrats never requested this,"" said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""This is completely false."" Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer’s spokesman echoed that. ""We’ve always said the funds must be restricted to existing border technology,"" said spokesman Justin Goodman. ""That’s what all the bills we’ve passed said."" According to Goodman, the Democrats’ offer is a continuing resolution on last year’s appropriations act. The law, passed with Republican and Democratic support, provided $1.3 billion for fencing and additional money for other types of border security. The language made it so that the funds could only be used on repairing or extending fencing that had already been built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006. Pelosi did not mention wall materials in her televised response to Trump. Instead, she talked about bringing more technology to the border. ""The fact is we all agree we need to secure our borders while honoring our values,"" Pelosi said. ""We can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry, we can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation. We can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border. We can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings."" The New York Times reported that on Jan. 5, Democrats asked the administration for a detailed plan of how the requested $5.7 billion would be used. The Office of Management and Budget reiterated the president’s request for a steel barrier. Democrats rebuffed that offer. Trump said, ""At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall."" There is no evidence that Democrats asked for a steel barrier. Democratic leadership affirmed there has been no request for a steel barrier. Democrats have been pushing for other forms to secure the border, including the reinforcement of existing physical barriers, but have made no concessions on Trump’s border wall proposals.

Warren overstates share of tax cuts for the rich
","In her first extended interview after saying she’d run for president, Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren took on the Republicans’ 2017 tax bill. Warren told MSNBC host Rachel Maddow that the package was a $1.5 trillion gift to ""billionaires and corporations."" Warren said that legislative push held Republicans together, regardless of what else they might think about President Donald Trump. ""He's a little louder and (they) don't like the tweet thing and the whole foreign policy seems to be a disaster,"" Warren said Jan. 2. ""But hey, the rich folks got $1.5 trillion."" The Republican Tax Cut and Jobs Act is certain to be a recurring theme throughout the presidential campaign, so we wanted to look closer at whether it gave ""rich folks"" $1.5 trillion. • The $1.5 trillion is one main government estimate of the net rise in deficits due to the tax act over 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office now predicts deficits will go up almost $1.9 trillion. • Based on estimates from Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation, about half of the tax cuts would flow to the top 10 percent of taxpayers, or those making $200,000 or more. • That means the amount of money going to ""rich folks"" would range from $750 billion to nearly $1 trillion, depending on whether you use the $1.5 trillion or the $1.9 trillion estimate. The 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act made temporary cuts in individual tax rates, and permanent cuts in corporate tax rates. In round figures, for ordinary wage income, the tax rate dropped about two percentage points, from about 29 percent down to 27 percent. On the corporate side, the maximum rate fell from 35 percent to 21 percent. Congress also changed the rules for estate taxes, temporarily raising the tax-exempt limit from $5.5 million to $11 million. Both the individual and estate tax changes end in 2025. Most of the initial estimates of what lies ahead stop at 2027, because that’s the budget time frame set by law. In order to assess Warren’s claim, we need two things: the total cost of the tax cuts and a table showing how those dollars are expected to flow to different income groups. The nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation delivers both. Based on the joint committee’s estimate of a $1.5 trillion cut, here’s how the money would be spread around. There’s no hard and fast rule to say who is rich, but households making $200,000 a year or more roughly account for the top 10 percent. In this chart of tax law benefits, they get 52 percent of the cuts. We ran this by Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. ""Using the joint committee numbers, it is reasonable to make the split at $200,000, and the numbers show they get about half the tax cut,"" Gleckman said. The Tax Policy Center ran its own model of how the tax law would play out. The results were about the same as the joint committee’s. ""High income people get much of the benefit, but far from all of it,"" Gleckman said. Economist Harvey Rosen at Princeton University called the 50/50 split ""a reasonable guess."" Alan Auerbach, a University of California-Berkeley economist agreed, saying ""ultimately, rough estimates are about all we can do."" And he cautioned against looking at the corporate tax cuts as a thing unto themselves, as Warren seemed to do when she talked about the cuts as a gift to ""billionaires and corporations."" At the end of the day, he said, that money goes to individuals. ""No economist would say a corporation is a beneficiary of a tax cut, in terms of its ultimate impact, since corporations aren't people. That term, presumably, is a short-hand for those associated with corporations, but it leaves unclear exactly whom, whether that’s corporate executives, corporate shareholders, but also perhaps corporate employees."" (The individual tax cuts reduced revenues by $1.1126 trillion, and corporate tax cuts reduced them by $653 billion, or about half as much.) Both the joint committee and the Tax Policy Center fold in the corporate cuts when they estimate the impact on people. The committee estimated the total costs of the cuts in two ways – one before looking at the effect of the cuts on the economy, and one after factoring in those effects. Without the economic effects, the tax law will result in an estimated $1.456 trillion in lower revenues by 2027. After factoring in the economic impact, the figure drops to $1.071 trillion. But the committee only estimated how tax payments would go up or down for each income group using the bigger number, about $1.5 trillion, and only for the odd-numbered years — 2019, 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027. We took the trends across those years and applied them to the total estimated tax reduction to estimate the share of the tax cuts going to each group. Warren campaign spokeswoman Kristen Orthman raised some issues with our findings. ""The Congressional Budget Office has already said the total cost will be $1.9 trillion, not $1.5 trillion,"" Orthman said. ""And the Joint Committee on Taxation distributional analysis does not account for major giveaways to the rich, like the tax bill's estate tax cuts. Even if only half the benefits go to people making more than $200,000, that's still well over a trillion dollars."" The Congressional Budget Office did raise its estimate. Auerbach and Gleckman were of mixed minds on how to treat that. Auerbach said the distribution pattern would probably be about the same and the wealthier households would end up with about $950 billion. Gleckman was less comfortable. ""If you are going to hang your distributional analysis on the Joint Committee on Taxations’ estimates, you also should use its revenue estimates,"" he told us. ""Otherwise you’ll be trying to mix-and-match data, which will only get you in trouble."" Orthman also noted that the joint committee did not factor in the change in the estate tax. The committee said that provision would cost $83 billion over 10 years. Given that this applies only to estates worth between $5.5 and $11 million, it’s likely that the beneficiaries would be well-to-do themselves. At least some of that $83 billion should be added to the $950 billion based on the CBO figure, Warren’s office said. That’s reasonable, but it doesn’t change the picture much. None of this is based on pinpoint accuracy. It’s fair to say that based on those assumptions, higher income households would get about $1 trillion. Finally, the Tax Foundation, a business-backed research group, took a different approach altogether. It looked not at whether taxes rose or fell, but how after-tax incomes changed. It found that every income group would be better off. Warren said that under the Republican tax law, ""the rich folks got $1.5 trillion."" During much of the tax cut debate, $1.5 trillion has been a shorthand measure of the ultimate cost of the bill. Looking at how the tax cuts are spread around, there’s broad agreement that higher income people do best. Those making $200,000 or more get about half of the cuts. There’s room to argue that a 50/50 split means those people get about $750 billion to $1 trillion over 10 years. But no model predicts they would get as much as Warren said, nor that they get all of the benefits. She exaggerated the gains for the well-to-do.

Trump gets facts wrong on Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
","President Donald Trump attempted to rewrite history by claiming that the reason for the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was to defeat terrorists entering Russia. While fielding questions from White House reporters about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, Trump revisited Russia’s Cold War-era occupation of the country.   ""The reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia,"" Trump said Jan. 2 during a Cabinet meeting. ""They were right to be there."" Documentary evidence shows Russia invaded Afghanistan as part of a broader Cold War strategy. But is there anything to Trump’s claim that terrorism was what motivated Moscow? Historians say no. ""There have never been any terrorist attacks from Afghanistan in Russia from the creation of the universe until now,"" said Barnett Rubin, an Afghanistan expert at New York University’s Center on International Cooperation. ""A few Chechens and Arabs who went to Chechnya participated in acts of terror in the 1990s,"" he added. ""None of them came from Afghanistan to do so, though some may have been there at one time, and not a single Afghan has ever been involved."" In other words, Trump’s retelling of Russia’s invasion is completely mistaken. ""The Soviet Union’s primary motivation to invade Afghanistan was to balance against a perceived growing U.S. interest in Afghanistan in the late 1970s,"" said Seth Jones, a political scientist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""It was about cold, calculating balance-of-power politics."" Moscow and Washington competed for sway over Afghanistan beginning in the 1950s. Its value as a Cold War bargaining chip lay in the fact that it was the Soviet Union’s southern neighbor, with the two sharing a nearly 1,500-mile border. The rivalry for Afghanistan began peacefully as a bidding war for Kabul’s affections. At the outset, each side attempted to curry favor through economic aid and other soft power measures, said Benjamin Hopkins, a professor of history and international affairs at George Washington University. But over the following decades the rivalry grew more tense as Afghan politics frayed. The Soviet Union viewed Afghanistan as part of its natural sphere of influence, while the United States saw it as the Soviet regime’s ""soft underbelly,"" in the words of former U.S. diplomat Graham Fuller. ""The United States saw this as an area of competition precisely because of Afghanistan’s proximity to the Soviet Union,"" said Benjamin Hopkins, a professor of history and international affairs at George Washington University. ""They saw this as an easier way in to undermine the Soviet Union."" In his political history of Afghanistan, In the Graveyard of Empires, Jones, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, relied on declassified Soviet documents that give a window into Moscow’s thinking at the time. In fall 1979, Soviet leadership grew increasingly worried that a new Afghan leader, Hafizullah Amin, was too amenable to Western influence. Or worse, that he was an agent of the CIA. The KGB warned the Politburo that Amin might turn to the United States for help with tamping down his country’s lingering civil unrest. In early December, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev convened his inner circle to discuss options, amid growing fears that the United States was increasingly eyeing Afghanistan. Soviet leadership decided to have the KGB depose Amin and replace him with Babrak Karmal, one of the leaders of the far-left April Revolution of the previous year. Brezhnev and his advisers also weighed deploying a large-scale contingent of troops to stabilize the country. By Dec. 27, 1979, Soviet forces numbered 50,000, with 5,000 troops and special forces positioned around the Afghan capital of Kabul, according to Jones’ account. Covert KGB forces launched an assault on the presidential palace where Amin and his security guards were located. ""Amin’s guards fought back for several hours,"" Jones wrote, ""but they were ultimately overcome, and KGB forces assassinated Amin."" In his place, Soviets installed their hand-picked successor, Babrak Karmal, who would lead Afghanistan for 7 years. The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan wore on for even longer, ultimately ending in defeat in February 1989. It’s possible Trump conflated several details related to the Soviet-Afghan conflict. Within days of the Soviet invasion, the U.S. launched a covert strategy to give lethal aid to Afghan Mujahideen insurgents who were fighting the occupying Soviet forces. Osama bin Laden, who would later become the world’s most notorious terrorist, was among a contingent of Arab fighters who fought against the Soviets alongside the Mujahideen. It’s worth noting there’s no evidence the United States directly armed or funded bin Laden (hat tip to our friends at Factcheck.org), though it’s possible this common misconception was on Trump’s mind at the time of his claim. In any event, U.S. aid went to the Afghan insurgents only after the Soviet invasion.   Trump said, ""The reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia."" The Soviet Union’s motivation for invading Afghanistan was about Cold War balance-of-power politics. At no point has Afghanistan served as a launchpad for terrorist attacks in Russia, historians said.

Sen. Tammy Baldwin makes hay with farm loss claim
","The plight of Wisconsin’s dairy farms has been well documented, with farmers struggling to hang on in the face of low milk prices and high costs. Some are losing thousands of dollars a month. Farmers were boosted by the news in December that Congress approved a $867 billion farm bill, spurred in part by pressure from farmers battered by President Donald Trump’s trade battles with China. After the bill was signed, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced a second round of direct payments to the hardest hit farmers. That good news was short-lived, however, as parts of the government shut down Dec. 22, 2018 amid the dispute over funding for Trump’s planned border wall. For instance, farmers say applications are on hold for a $12 billion emergency aid package. The deadline to apply for that program was supposed to be Jan. 15, 2019 but may have to be extended.   U.S Sen. Tammy Baldwin, whose website touts her legislative efforts on behalf of dairy farmers, weighed in Jan. 2, 2019 with this tweet: ""Wisconsin lost over 600 farms last year & our farmers can't afford the #TrumpShutdown."" Did Wisconsin lose over 600 farms last year? And is the shutdown hurting those that remain? The evidence Baldwin’s office pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection data showing that in December 2018, Wisconsin had 8,163 dairy herds. A year earlier, in December 2017, there were 8,839, a loss of 676 dairy farms. That's a 7.6 percent decline in the number of registered dairy herds — the biggest drop since record keeping started in 2004. So, the tweet is on point if you only look at dairy farms. But, as the agriculture department website notes: ""Wisconsin is America’s Dairyland but there is more produced and processed in our state than just milk and cheese."" According to the department’s ""Wisconsin Agricultural Statistics"" 2017 fact sheet (the most recent available): * The state is home to 68,500 farms on 14.3 million acres. The average farm size in Wisconsin is 209 acres. * The state ranks third in the nation in potato production, harvesting potatoes on some 67,000 acres in 2017. * Wisconsin cranberry production for 2017 totaled 5.37 million barrels. Growers harvested 20,600 acres. Wisconsin produces 64 percent of the nation's crop, making it the top cranberry producing state in the country. *The state also produces a large tart cherry crop, producing 11.3 million pounds in 2017. *Wisconsin produced 49.0​ million pounds of apples in 2017. *Wisconsin is home to about 8,000 dairy farms, more than any other state, and 1.28 million cows.​ So, how are those farms faring? Baldwin’s tweet did not specify dairy farms. Is it possible when non-dairy farms are included that the overall total is growing? Not likely. The final numbers for 2018 are not yet available, but for there to be an increase, it would have to buck a steady trend in the opposite direction. Here is a look at recent years: 2014: 69,000 farms 2015, 68,900 farms 2016: 68,700 farms 2017: 68,500 farms Impact of the shutdown Let’s return to the second part of Baldwin’s claim, that the shutdown is negatively affecting Wisconsin’s farmers. In a Dec. 28, 2018, news release updating the government shutdown, the USDA assured farmers receiving trade-war assistance that checks would continue to go out during the first week of the shutdown. But direct payments for farmers who haven’t certified production, as well as farm loans and disaster assistance programs, will be put on hold, and won’t start up again until the government fully reopens. USDA Farm Service Agency offices, which process farm loans and gathers data farmers need to make decisions, are closed. About $10 million in payments were headed to Wisconsin farmers through the federal farm bailout program, with 11 farms getting more than $50,000 each, 237 less than $100, and a few thousand farms somewhere in between. According to a Nov. 28, 2018 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story, federal data obtained by the Washington, D.C.,-based Environmental Working Group shows the average payment for Wisconsin farmers was $2,145. The Journal Sentinel article explained that the Wisconsin Farmers Union, based on a survey of its members, says a 55-cow dairy farm would receive a one-time payment of $725 from the Trump bailout program, but it will lose between $36,000 and $48,000 over the year due to low milk prices. An 80-cow dairy would get $889, barely enough to cover its electric bill for a month. Meanwhile, it will lose $35,000. A 290-cow dairy would get $4,905 but stands to lose up to $400,000. The Wisconsin Farmers Union, based in Chippewa Falls, represents mostly small and average-size farms. Our rating Baldwin tweeted: ""Wisconsin lost over 600 farms last year & our farmers can't afford the #TrumpShutdown."" The numbers show the 600 is in the ballpark among dairy farms. While dairy farms make up a small percentage of the state’s overall farm total, recent years show a downward trend there as well And we know dairy farms were especially battered in 2018. Additionally, it is clear at least some state farms -- particularly those involved in dairy -- are being negatively affected by the shutdown. We rate Baldwin’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/jan/09/tammy-baldwin/sen-tammy-baldwin-makes-hay-farm-claim/

No, an election board leader didn't try to 'drag' a woman out of the hospital
","The Republican-led North Carolina legislature has been grappling with Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper over the structure of the state elections board. Cooper threatened to veto the GOP’s proposal for restructuring the elections board and, in response, Republican state Senate leader Phil Berger accused Cooper of trying to weaponize the board’s ""investigatory power."" Berger offered an example of how, he suggests, a Democratic elections board member wrongfully tried to influence the board’s investigation of a Republican legislator. ""Cooper’s now-disgraced hand-picked chairman, Andy Penry, tried to drag a cancer-stricken woman out of her hospital bed to testify at her son’s hearing on the first day of early voting over a bogus complaint that the Board hadn’t even fully investigated,"" Berger’s office said in a press release to media outlets on Dec. 19. (Cooper followed through on his threat to veto the bill, and legislators later overrode his veto.) Berger’s statement references the case of state Sen. Ralph Hise, a Republican from Mitchell County, who earlier this year faced questions from the N.C. State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement over his campaign finances. The complaints were filed in 2017 and the elections board scheduled a hearing for Oct. 17, 2018. A week prior to the hearing date, Hise sought to delay the hearing because his mother — who acted as his campaign treasurer — couldn’t testify. Hise said she was in the hospital battling cancer. That’s where Penry’s comments come in to play. So let’s go through Berger’s statement, claim-by-claim. Doctor’s note requested Did Penry try to ""drag a cancer-stricken woman out of her hospital bed to testify at her son’s Board of Elections hearing?"" No. In an Oct. 5 letter to the board that WSOC posted online, Hise’s attorney Steven Long wrote that Hise’s campaign couldn’t ""properly"" respond to questions without Hise’s mother, Shirley. Long noted that Shirley Hise was the person responsible for calculating the senator’s mileage reimbursement payments, ""which are the center of the board’s inquiry."" But Shirley Hise, Long wrote, was unable to walk while undergoing cancer treatments at a hospital in Asheville. He said more information about her health would be available ""in a couple of weeks"" and offered to provide more details if needed. Penry, a Democrat appointed to the elections board by Cooper, replied in an Oct. 8 letter that he’d relay Ralph Hise’s request for a delay to the board. However, Penry noted that state law requires that ""matters such as this be resolved expeditiously."" Penry told Long to bring a doctor’s note confirming Shirley Hise’s condition along with information about when she’d be able to testify. ""You should be prepared to proceed with all portions of your presentation other than the testimony of Ms. Hise ... as chair, I am not inclined to delay the entire matter to an unknown date."" In an interview with PolitiFact, Penry said the goal of his letter was to verify Shirley Hise’s condition, find out if she could participate through other means, and determine whether Ralph Hise could proceed without her. ""At no time did I demand that Mrs. Hise show up,"" Penry told PolitiFact. Contacted by PolitiFact, Berger spokesman Pat Ryan said Shirley Hise’s doctors were ""forced"" to substantiate her condition. ""That is tantamount to trying to drag her out of her hospital bed to testify,"" Ryan said. PolitiFact disagrees. Hise paid settlement Next: was the complaint about Hise bogus? He certainly didn’t get off scot-free. In March 2017, Hise was accused of illegally taking money from his campaign account and violating laws requiring full disclosure of campaign contributors, the N&O reported in May 2017. The two complaints were filed by Greg Flynn of Raleigh, a Democrat who serves on the Wake County Board of Elections. The complaints allege Hise: Hise reached a settlement with the elections board in November. The settlement can be found on the elections board website. In the deal announced Nov. 27, Hise agreed to pay the board $4,000 to reimburse the cost of investigating the allegations and another $500 into a civil penalty and forfeiture fund, The News & Observer reported that day. Ryan, Berger’s spokesman, said the word ""bogus"" was used because the complaint was filed by a long-time Democratic operative and used by Sen. Hise’s opponent. The complaint, Ryan added, ""was based on relatively common campaign report mistakes that any volunteer treasurer could make."" But the fact that ""mistakes"" were made and Hise was fined invalidates the argument that the complaints were meritless. Legal limbo What about the claim that the state elections board ""hadn’t fully investigated"" the complaint for which it was scheduling a hearing? That appears to be true. That comes from an email from the NC elections board staff to John Lewis, a Republican member of the elections board. WBTV published excerpts of the email in an Oct. 14 story. ""Staff does not consider the investigation to be complete. Three team members, including Director Strach, spent Wednesday in Spruce Pine (Mitchell County) interviewing two CPAs who worked with Ms. Hise on the campaign reports,"" a staff attorney wrote to Lewis in response to his inquiry, according to WBTV. The email continued: ""Staff believes that a continuance of the matter would allow for an orderly conclusion of the investigation. There is no evidence that any wrongdoing is presently ongoing, so this is a historical investigation."" PolitiFact doesn’t know whether it’s common for the state elections board to schedule hearings before it completes campaign finance investigations. Penry, for his part, told PolitiFact that he was unaware the investigation wasn’t complete when he scheduled the Oct. 17 hearing. Our ruling Berger said Penry ""tried to drag a cancer-stricken woman out of her hospital bed to testify at her son’s hearing on the first day of early voting over a bogus complaint that the Board hadn’t even fully investigated."" He appears to have a point about the hearing being scheduled before the investigation was complete. However, Berger grossly exaggerates Penry’s request of Hise’s mother (the ""cancer-stricken woman"") and downplays Hise’s violations. We rate this Mostly False.

Contrary to Falwell claim, Trump did worse than 'average president' in first midterm
","Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University in Lynchburg, was thumbs-up on President Donald Trump during a question-and-answer interview published in the Washington Post on News Year’s Day, saying, ""I can’t imagine him doing anything that’s not good for the country."" The interview ran two days before the 116th Congress was sworn in, seating the first Democratic majority in the House of Representatives in eight years - a change caused by last year’s midterm elections when Democrats gained 40 seats in the chamber. Many pundits and politicians say the results reflect voter dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump, a Republican. Falwell, however, says Trump weathered the election well. ""This midterm, the president did better than the average president does in his first midterms,"" the evangelical leader said. ""So I think the message is that the American people are happy with the direction the country is headed and happy with the economy, happy with our newfound respect in the world. It’s a better result than you normally see in the first midterms."" We wondered if Falwell is right that Trump got above average results in his first midterm election. So we took an empirical look. The numbers Although Republicans lost 40 seats in the House last November, they won two new seats in the Senate. Overall, that comes to a 38-seat Republican loss in Congress. Falwell didn’t say how many presidents he was counting in his statement. Records show that 24 of the 28 presidents since 1862 saw their party’s congressional seats drop during their first midterms. So Trump has company. The average loss in all those elections was 30 seats - better than the 38-seat drop under Trump. Ranking the 28 presidents from best results to worst, Trump came in 18th. He did not, as Falwell claimed, ""do better than the average president."" Presidents in office after World War II ended in 1945 saw similar results. Of those 13 presidents, 12 experienced losses during their first midterm (the exception being George W. Bush in 2002, who gained nine seats). The average loss was 31 seats. Ranking those presidents from best results to worst, Trump is No. 8. That, again, contradicts Falwell’s statement. Falwell’s Response How does Falwell defend his claim? We received a written statement from Falwell saying his remarks were intended to ""reflect"" that Trump fared better than the last two Democratic presidents in their first midterms. Democrats lost 62 seats under Bill Clinton in 1994, and 69 under Barack Obama in 2010. Why didn’t he just say that in the Q&A? Falwell’s spokesman, Scott Lamb, said the midterm discussion was a small part of the interview and Falwell was focused on core questions he was being asked about why evangelicals back Trump. Our ruling Falwell said, ""This midterm, the president did better than the average president does in his first midterms."" The claim does not stand up. Republicans lost 38 congressional seats in the 2018 elections and control of the House of Representatives. Of the 28 presidents who have served since 1862, that’s the 18th highest losses by their party during their first midterms. The average drop was 30 seats. If we just consider the 13 post-World War II presidents, Trump saw the eighth highest losses. Those presidents experienced an average drop of 31 seats in their first midterm. Falwell, asked to prove his statement, substitutes a different claim: that Trump outperformed Democrats Clinton and Obama during their first midterms. Statistics consistently show Trump performed slightly worse than the average president during his first midterm.

The NC Democrats overstated this law’s effect on election investigations
","Neither Democrats nor Republicans seem to trust the other party to properly investigate election fraud in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District race. The state elections board is investigating voting irregularities in the race between Republican Mark Harris and Democrat Dan McCready, which has left the seat vacant in Congress. Complicating matters: a legal tug-of-war between Gov. Roy Cooper and the GOP-led legislature recently left the elections office without board members. To rectify the situation, legislators last month approved a bill that would launch a new elections board on Jan. 31. Democrats reacted with suspicion to the bill, claiming that it affects the transparency of investigations into elections fraud. ""The NC GOP can’t keep their story straight. They attacked the SBOE for lack of transparency. Now, they’re ramming through a provision that’ll make investigations like #NC09 *less* transparent,"" the North Carolina Democratic Party tweeted on Dec. 27. Cooper vetoed the bill and the legislature overrode his veto on Dec. 27, creating the new board. Is it true that the N.C. General Assembly approved legislation that’ll reduce the transparency of investigations like the one into the Harris-McCready results? To rate the NC Democratic Party claim, we must look at the nature of that investigation. As PolitiFact noted in a recent fact check of the North Carolina Republican Party, the state elections board hasn’t revealed much about the scope of its investigation, which is ongoing. But it appears to center on potential fraud in mail-in absentee ballots. Doesn’t affect election fraud probes PolitiFact reviewed the bill, and didn’t find evidence that it hides the process of election fraud investigations. Part 5 of the bill, which addresses absentee ballot fraud investigations, doesn’t mention anything about confidentiality. It says: ""By April 1, 2019, the State Board of Elections shall report and make recommendations to the Joint Legislative Elections and Ethics Oversight Committee on absentee ballot fraud. The report shall address all of the following: (1) Efforts to identify and investigate instances of potential mail-in ballot harvesting. (2) Data and statistics on the number of requests for mail-in absentee ballots, the number of returned mail-in absentee ballots for the past five election cycles, and any trends or patterns that appear analyzing those data and statistics. (3) Any other related matter identified by the State Board impacting voting absentee ballot.""   The law does, however, require investigations into potential campaign finance violations to be confidential, The News & Observer reported. It ""only makes campaign finance investigations confidential. Not election fraud,"" according to Gerry Cohen, former special counsel to the N.C. General Assembly and longtime legislative staffer. State Rep. David Lewis, a Harnett County Republican, was a lead negotiator of the bill. He said it affects campaign finance investigations, not allegations of other election law violations. He added it may increase transparency. ""First, Part V of House Bill 1029 requires the State Board of Elections to formally report to the General Assembly absentee ballot problems in the last few years. There is no foreseeable reason that report won’t be made public,"" Lewis said in an email to PolitiFact. ""Secondly, Section 4.9 requires additional information regarding absentee ballots to be transmitted to the State Board, which traditionally makes all of this information public."" A different kind of investigation So how does the law affect campaign finance violations? Previously, the elections board has confirmed the existence of campaign finance investigations, The N&O reported. Under the new law, however, an investigation might only become widely known if charges are filed or the person making the accusation goes public. Robert Howard, a spokesman for the N.C. Democratic Party, believes the 9th district investigation could reveal campaign finance violations. ""Based on materials released by the State Board of Elections and sworn statements from residents in NC-09, there is clear reason to believe (Bladen County political operative) McCrae Dowless and others may have committed campaign finance violations in addition to operating an illegal ballot harvesting scheme,"" Howard said in an email. ""This year, the NCGOP, the Harris campaign, and Red Dome Group either contracted or sub-contracted with Dowless who then ran a paid-ballot harvesting operation, often paying employees in cash."" He continued: ""If an investigation like NC09 involved campaign finance violations and a separate violation (such as, in this instance, illegal ballot harvesting), investigators who are forced by this law to keep the campaign finance violation confidential may be forced to keep the full investigation confidential as well."" Howard has a point. Materials disclosed by the state elections board allude to potential financial violations. But, while it’s true that the board could find campaign finance violations as part of its probe, payoff questions aren’t the stated holdup in the District 9 race. In a Nov. 30 press release, the board has said it’s reviewing ""irregularities and fraudulent activities related to absentee by-mail voting and potentially other matters in the 9th Congressional District contest."" Regardless of what those ""other matters"" may turn out to be, the NC Democratic Party’s tweet gives the impression that the bill obscures election fraud investigations — which it doesn’t. Our ruling The N.C. Democratic Party tweeted that legislators supported a provision ""that’ll make investigations like #NC09 less transparent."" The bill, which is now law, potentially conceals allegations of campaign finance violations. But it doesn’t affect the process for disclosing information related to election fraud investigations.

Chris Christie repeats claim about 70 percent hike in New Jersey property taxes
","
The years before Gov. Chris Christie became governor were just awful, with previous administrations raising property taxes by startling amounts, he suggested during Tuesday’s budget address to the Legislature.

In describing the way things used to be done in New Jersey, Christie asked lawmakers and the public to recall the state’s dire financial straits as recently as four years ago.

""Property taxes had increased 70 percent in the previous 10 years,"" Christie said, according to the text of his speech.

Christie has made this claim before, first in October at a town hall meeting in West Milford.

Given that New Jersey has the highest property taxes in the nation, the 70 percent jump in a decade might not seem so shocking. But we learned a couple of things: first, the increase was actually slightly higher than 70 percent, but it falls once property tax rebates are factored into the mix.

Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak told PolitiFact New Jersey at the time that the 70 percent jump in taxes in the decade before the governor took office resulted from ""unrestrained spending and overgenerous benefits and the expansion of government at the local and state level.""

Let’s look at the numbers.

The average property tax bill in New Jersey was roughly $4,240 in 1999, according to data from the state Department of Community Affairs.

By 2009 -- the year before Christie took office -- the average property tax bill had climbed to about $7,280.

That increase amounts to more than 71 percent.

Now let’s look at the issue of rebates.

In previous fact-checks, experts have explained that reductions in property tax rebate programs could be viewed as tax hikes, since they’re intended to reduce property tax costs for homeowners.

In 1999, when the NJ Saver program was started under former Gov. Christie Whitman, the average rebate check mailed to homeowners was $111.

By 2009, the average rebate was $1,037.

When those rebates are deducted from the average property tax bill, the increase over the decade before Christie took office comes in under 70 percent.

In 1999, homeowners paid an average of about $4,130 in property taxes, with the rebate. In 2009, that figure jumped to roughly $6,240, an increase of more than 51 percent.

Christie stopped delivering checks for property tax relief during his first year in office and changed the program so the rebate was deducted from property tax bills.

In 2011, the average property tax bill was $7,759. With the credit, the average bill was $7,519.

Our ruling

Christie said during his budget address that ""property taxes had increased 70 percent in the previous 10 years"" to him becoming governor.

Looking at the numbers, the average property tax bill in the 10 years before Christie took office climbed more than 70 percent, from about $4,240 to about $7,280.

But the increase drops to more like 50 percent when property tax rebates are factored into the equation.

Still, the overall point here is that property taxes jumped significantly in the decade before he became governor.

Ohio Tax Commissioner Joseph Testa says consumption has shifted over the years from goods to services
","
Ohio Gov. John Kasich has proposed a broad overhaul of the state’s tax system as part of his biennial budget proposal.

At a news conference to unveil his plans, he called on Ohio Tax Commissioner Joseph Testa to help explain proposed changes in the tax code.

The governor’s proposal includes cuts to the state’s personal income tax and a 50 percent income deduction for small businesses. One way some of that revenue loss would be offset is through changes to the state’s sales tax.

While the 5.5 percent rate would be cut to 5 percent, the tax base would be broadened by applying it to most services. It now principally applies just to sales of goods.

Testa, while explaining the plan, said the changes were long overdue and needed to address the evolution of the state’s economy over nearly eight decades.

""About two-thirds of all consumption is services. The tax code has never been updated to address that. It was just the opposite (when the tax was enacted) in the '30s.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to assess the tax commissioner’s claim.

Ohio enacted its sales tax in 1935 as a way to raise revenue to help public schools that were struggling to pay their bills during the Great Depression. At the time, most schools received their funding through property taxes.

Many Ohioans failed to pay their taxes because of the difficult economic times, according to Ohio History Central, an online product of the Ohio Historical Society. As a result, schools had less money to pay educational expenses.

Prior to enactment of the Ohio Retail Sales Tax Law there were taxes on sales of cigarettes and gasoline, but on few other products. The new tax extended to nearly all goods, and dramatically increased tax receipts. It raised nearly $17 million for public schools in 1935. Some revenue also went to help local governments.

Since then, the tax has remained focused on the sale of goods. The governor’s budget proposal, though, would add the tax to sales associated with nearly all services. Everything from haircuts and movie tickets to lawyer bills and real estate services would be subject to a 5-cent tax on every dollar.

But what about Testa’s contention that Ohio’s economy has evolved and that transactions involving services now account for two-thirds of all personal consumption expenditures?

We contacted Testa’s office to ask on what he based his statement. Were there numbers to support the reversal in spending habits?

Gary Gudmundson, a spokesman for Testa, provided a chart that the Department of Taxation had prepared for the budget rollout. It attributed its figures to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

For 1935, the year Ohio enacted the sales tax, it showed total personal consumption of $55.9 billion, with $31.6 billion (56.5 percent) going toward goods and $24.3 billion (43.5 percent) going to services. Not quite 2-to-1 in favor of goods, but goods sales accounted for a solid majority of purchases.

Money spent on personal consumption climbed steadily over the years. By 2012 the total consumption figure was about $11.12 trillion. About $3.78 trillion (34 percent) was for goods purchases. About $7.34 trillion (66 percent) was for services.

We checked and the numbers provided in the state’s chart match the Bureau of Economic Analysis data.

It should be noted, though, that the data reflects money spent on goods and services on a national basis. The Bureau of Economic Analysis told us that it didn’t have state-by-state data. Gudmundson said the state had rough figures that only went back to the ‘80s, but that the expectation was that Ohio, as one of the larger states in the nation, would have economic experience similar to the national figures.

State-specific numbers on production help bolster Testa’s contention, although production is not the same as consumption. In 2011, the state saw $326 billion in privately produced services and $102 billion in privately produced goods. The figures illustrate ""the continuing shift in Ohio’s economy away from goods production and towards services,"" according to a report last year from Ohio’s Policy Research and Strategic Planning Office.

So where does that leave Testa’s claim?

He said that about two-thirds of consumption is for services, and on a national basis, data shows he is correct. One could reasonably conclude that the same trend holds true in Ohio. Testa also said it was just the opposite when the state enacted its sales tax.

On a national basis, the goods purchases didn’t account for two-thirds of total consumption in 1935, but it was a significant majority. And the numbers support Testa’s overarching point that the economy has changed significantly since then to be a service dominated market.

Ray LaHood: sequestration will delay air travel
","
President Barack Obama and his Cabinet secretaries are running a full-court press warning Americans about the consequences of sequestration and goading Republicans to act to prevent it.

Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has been making the rounds on political talk shows and appeared at a White House press conference. He says the sweeping spending cuts will force the Federal Aviation Administration to furlough employees, and that will mean headaches for travelers.

""Flights to major cities like New York, Chicago, and San Francisco and others could experience delays of up to 90 minutes during peak hours because we have fewer controllers on staff.  Delays in these major airports will ripple across the country,"" LaHood said at the White House on Feb. 22, 2013.

""There's going to be a slowdown and delays in flights,"" he said on MSNBC on Feb. 25.

We have examined claims about how sequestration will affect everything from child care to criminal prosecutions. In many cases, the warnings from the Obama administration are portraying worst-case scenarios. That’s the case with air travel, too.

Cuts, then furloughs

Sequestration will force the FAA to carve $600 million from its budget, and LaHood says furloughing air traffic controllers is the last step after every other cut has been made.

But air traffic controllers make up a big chunk of the FAA’s workforce: 15,000 of its 47,000 employees.

""We’re looking at everything possible; and everything possible that’s legal, we will do,"" he said at the White House. That includes cutting travel, cutting overtime, freezing hiring, cancelling conferences and reducing contracts.

Low-traffic airports are also a main target for cutbacks. The FAA has identified about 250 less-used airports and may shut down 100 or so of those towers completely. Airport operators can choose to staff the towers in other ways in order to keep the airports open.

""We want to minimize the impact on the largest number of travelers,"" FAA chairman Michael Huerta told an American Bar Association conference this week. ""It's for that reason that we need to start at the lowest-level facilities, meaning the smallest facilities that have the fewest operations.""

Huerta also noted that many airports have comparatively little activity during the midnight shift, so the FAA has identified locations where that shift can be cut.

But ultimately, officials say, sequestration leaves little room for flexibility.

""The sequester language does not allow us to move funding from account to account, and we simply can’t make the required cuts without facility closures and furloughs,"" DOT spokesman Justin Nisly told PolitiFact.

In addition, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has said the cuts would force the Transportation Security Administration to furlough its 50,000 security screeners for up to seven days.

 ‘Controllable event’

It may not be time to cancel your vacations plans yet, however.

Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with the advisory firm Hudson Crossing, said much of the real effect of the sequester is unknown.

""We don't know whether airlines will cancel flights and, if so, how many, the routes, time of day, and so on,"" he said.

Even with those unknowns, the FAA has wiggle room.

""I view this as a ‘controllable’ event, in that government is opting to reduce the number of on-duty air traffic controllers and TSA airport security screening officers rather than take other steps to manage their reduced budgets,"" Harteveldt said. ""I distinguish this from an ‘uncontrollable’ event, like 9/11.""

Sequestration does not allow federal agencies to shift money between departments -- say delaying an equipment order to keep pay air traffic controllers. But they can still prioritize under their reduced budget, cutting more deeply in administrative staff or contracting staff.

""They’re not moving money, but they have some flexibility in where the reductions would take place,"" said John Cox, an aviation safety consultant and former US Airways pilot.

And precedent, he said, points to some insulation for air traffic controllers.

""There are certain essential jobs that get funded regardless,"" Cox said. ""Air traffic controllers are very high on the list of priorities.""

Clifford Winston, an economist with the centrist Brookings Institution, praised the FAA’s effort to start by cutting at low-traffic centers. Federal airport dollars are spread around to thousands of airports, big and small, instead of sending the most money to places with the most travelers.

""The interesting point is the inefficiency by which money is allocated for transportation in this country -- which is not proportionate to where the traffic is,"" Winston said. ""That inefficiency can be exploited in a good way.""

90 whole minutes?

About that groan-worthy notion of 90-minute delays in major cities: Nisly said officials went into the field and asked district managers at airports how they would manage furloughs and what the impact would be. They found that at many airports, the work of getting airplanes to take off and land safely couldn’t function at full capacity if there were furloughs.

That means ""delays of up to 90 minutes during peak hours for travelers to major cities like New York, Chicago, and San Francisco,"" Nisly said.

Erik Hansen, director of domestic policy at the U.S. Travel Association, which promotes increased travel to and within the United States, said sequestration will inevitably make an already cumbersome process worse.

""This could be the one place that most Americans see the impact of sequestration,"" Hansen said. ""It’s going to have a real impact on communities and the defense industry, but I think for everyday Americans -- we have almost 2 million people fly in the country every day. We’re going to have a lot of people understand quickly the impact.""

Our ruling

LaHood is warning that once sequestration hits, travelers will experience flight delays.

Experts we interviewed said the Obama administration has a fair amount of leeway to reduce the impact on some travelers. That said, the FAA has made clear that air traffic controllers consume so much of the agency’s budget that some will have to be taken off the job, and that will diminish the functioning of the nation’s airports.

Rep. Greg Walden says Keystone XL pipeline would create 20,000 'American jobs' with 800 in Oregon
","The Keystone XL pipeline is years from operating and may, in fact, never be built.

But that doesn’t mean the 1,700-mile project from Canada’s oil-rich tar sands in Alberta that would bring heavy crude to the Gulf of Mexico isn’t already pumping product, at least rhetorically. The U.S. State Department is expected to decide by the end of March whether to grant a permit that must be issued for the pipeline to be built. (The State Department is involved because the pipeline would cross an international border.)

It’s a high-stakes, high volume, politically charged exercise. Environmentalists have protested -- and been arrested -- in recent days in front of the White House as part of their campaign to pressure President Barack Obama to reject the project.

The other side has been just as active. That includes U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who has long supported the pipeline as a way to make the United States more energy self-sufficient and boost the economy -- even in Oregon.

Here’s what he tweeted Jan. 29, 2013: ""Did you know that the#KeystoneXL project is expected to create 20,000 American jobs, including more than 800 in Oregon?""

That’s an attention-grabbing statement for two reasons. The first is the overall number of jobs at a time when the U.S. economy continues to struggle. The second concerns both numbers and geography. The pipeline as proposed would enter the U.S. in Montana and angle toward the Gulf on an eastward track through South Dakota and Nebraska. From there it continues to the Gulf.

Even if the route changes, the pipeline will be 1,000 miles (or more) from Oregon. So it’s fair to ask, how will a state so far removed from the project claim 800 jobs? Here’s a second, more basic question: Is the 20,000 ""American jobs"" cited by Walden and many other supporters of the project real?

Let’s take a look.

Sure enough, TransCanada, the company proposing the pipeline has cited the potential for 20,000 jobs. ""The $7 billion oil pipeline is the largest infrastructure project on the books in the U.S. right now,"" the company said in a 2012 news release. ""It would create 20,000 jobs: 13,000 in construction, 7,000 in manufacturing.""

There have been numerous analyses and copious filings by the company itself in pursuit of the permit.

And yet, the conclusion that 20,000 jobs would be created is more than a bit slippery.

A 2011 study by Cornell University is absolute: ""The company’s claim that KXL will create 20,000 direct construction and manufacturing jobs in the U.S is not substantiated,"" it states.

One of the more troublesome devices is this: The total is a reflection of something called ""job years."" Why is that important?  A ""job year"" is a measure of one job performed for one year. That means if a single worker stays on the job for the two years the pipeline construction is expected to last, that single worker counts as two jobs.

The measure might be accepted -- and used -- by economists but it’s not what the average person thinks when hearing the word ""job."" TransCanada says the 20,000 jobs include 13,000 direct jobs, mostly construction and 7,000 indirect jobs. If the project takes two years, it means 6,500 actual direct jobs (plus or minus), which is the number the State Department uses.

Calculated that way, the actual number of people employed by the pipeline moves closer to 10,000, or some 6,500 workers in construction and 3,500 in manufacturing. Not 20,000.
   
Here’s another important point: These construction jobs are not permanent and, for the most part, aren’t necessarily local. The positions will disappear when the pipeline is complete. The State Department estimates that only 10 to 15 percent of these jobs can be filled with workers from communities in the pipeline’s path.

As for the broader (and always murky) world of indirect jobs, the study  -- by Lara Skinner and Sean Sweeney at Cornell’s Global Labor Institute -- raises questions about an analysis by the Perryman Group, which was hired by TransCanada to look at economic impacts.

""The Perryman study is based on expenditure and sourcing data provided by TransCanada,
and none of that information has been disclosed or subject to independent review,"" the Cornell study says.

By their calculations, Perryman uses a multiplier of 18 job-years for every $1 million spent on the project. Skinner and Sweeney write that a more acceptable multiplier is 11 job-years for every $1 million spent.

""So a reasonable estimate of the total incremental U.S. jobs from KXL construction is about one-third of the figure estimated in the Perryman study and used by industry to advocate for the construction of KXL,"" the Cornell study concludes.

Let’s move on to the second part of Walden’s claim, that the pipeline would bring ""800 jobs"" to Oregon.

Unlike a lot of states far removed from the actual pipeline route, there is an official thread to Oregon.

In a January 2012 news release promoting the pipeline’s economic value, TransCanada says this: ""Construction of Keystone XL is expected to create 7000 manufacturing jobs.  Key support companies include: Welspun (pipe from Arkansas), Cameron (valves from Louisiana), Siemens (pumps, motors and related control equipment manufactured in Oregon, Ohio and Indiana) and dozens of other companies manufacturing everything from nuts and bolts to complex electrical control equipment.""

That’s as specific as it gets, however. When asked for source material to back this claim of 800 jobs, Walden’s office referred to a Chamber of Commerce study. Sure enough, the publication says there will be 838 jobsattributable to the pipelinein Oregon by 2020. (Once again, the use of ""jobs"" is not what an average person expects.)

Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Blair Latoff Holmes said the number was taken from a study commissioned by the pro-pipeline American Petroleum Institute, written by the Canadian Energy Research Institute and released in June 2011.


All of these studies are vulnerable to criticism because the formulas are by necessity often more art than science and the methodology used is not clearly expressed. That’s why the conclusions should be consumed with caution.

But tone matters too. In his statement, Walden seems absolute even while there is no clarification that the 20,000 figure refers to ""job years,"" which is much different than the way ""job"" is commonly understood.

Walden has a somewhat stronger case on the Oregon job claim, mostly because TransCanada mentions Oregon by name as one state that would produce equipment needed for the project. As for the number 800, however, it is at best a guess.

That’s a pipeline full of uncertainty. We rate this claim Mostly False: It contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",/factchecks/2013/feb/27/greg-walden/rep-greg-walden-says-keystone-xl-pipeline-would-cr/

""Mallard Fillmore"" says government study shows Head Start “has little or no impact on the children it’s supposed to help”
","
The self-described ""right-leaning duck"" who appears on funny pages nationwide provoked PolitiFact Texas readers earlier this month.

Several asked us to look into the ""Mallard Fillmore"" comic strip’s statements about Head Start, such as this from the Feb. 9, 2013, cartoon: ""A government study has found that the vaunted ‘Head Start’ program actually has little or no impact on the children it’s supposed to help."" 
 
All is not lost, though: The ""Fillmore Foundation"" found the program makes Head Start supporters ""feel really really good about themselves,"" joked the strip. It includes a footnote citing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; other ""Mallard"" Head Start comics between Feb. 6 and Feb. 13 do the same or cite the conservative Heritage Foundation’s website.

The federal Head Start program was launched by Congress in the mid-1960s to help preschool-age children from low-income families. With an annual budget of $8 billion, it offers such children educational activities, medical/dental care, meals and safe playtime. 
King Features Syndicate spokeswoman Claudia Smith told us by email that ""Mallard"" cartoonist Bruce Tinsley was speaking about a new report that Health and Human Services issued on its 2002-08 study of Head Start’s effects, which Congress mandated in 1998 when it continued the program.

To determine how the program affected school readiness and when or how it was most effective, the department tracked 4,667 students in 23 states whose families applied to get them into Head Start. The children, all aged 3 or 4, were randomly assigned to a Head Start program or a control group. Data were gathered on measures of cognitive and social-emotional development, health and parenting practices.

An earlier, Jan. 15, 2010, report covered results from fall 2002 through the end of the students’ first-grade years. The 3-year-olds could have logged as much as two years in Head Start, the 4-year-olds only one; children not initially assigned to Head Start might have participated in other preschool programs or reapplied.

At the end of preschool, the Head Start 3-year-olds showed advantages, mainly in language and literacy categories such as naming letters and oral comprehension, over non-Head Start 3-year-olds. Fewer positive outcomes were recorded for the 4-year-olds, and both age groups’ advantages had faded by the end of first grade, according to the report. 
The department’s October 2012 report, released Dec. 21, 2012, updated study results through the end of third grade. And like the first-grade results, the 2012 report said that ""there were initial positive impacts from having access to Head Start, but by the end of 3rd grade there were very few impacts found. ...The few impacts that were found did not show a clear pattern of favorable or unfavorable impacts for children.""

We tallied the results for children assigned to Head Start as compared to the control group: 
To sum that up: The Head Start age groups were doing 45 percent (the 3-year-olds) or 27 percent (the 4-year-olds) better than their peers at the end of Head Start. By the end of third grade, though, the results were only a few percentage points apart and the Head Start children had fallen behind in several categories.

Among the negative results at the end of third grade, the 3-year-olds showed a drop in ""school promotion"" (advancing to the next grade) and the 4-year-olds showed increased ""emotional symptoms"" and declines in relationships with teachers and peers. 
We checked to see if the study was considered solid and how it fit into other research on the topic.

Harvard University’s Center on the Developing Child interpreted the 2010 findings in an undated ""brief"" that said in part, ""Overall, the study was sound scientifically, but there has been considerable debate over what its findings mean."" The fact that Head Start advantages disappeared by the end of first grade, it said, apparently meant that ""the comparison children were able to catch up to their peers in the Head Start treatment group during the first two years of school.""

Two experts took issue with one aspect of the study’s results: Even if children exited or entered Head Start after the study began, they were still counted as part of the group to which they were first assigned. The 2012 report said 15 percent to 20 percent of the children assigned to the Head Start group exited the program, while 14 percent to 17 percent of children who started in the control group were later admitted to Head Start.

Retired early-education researcher John Love, who directed a 1995-2002 study on Early Head Start (the federal program for low-income children up to age 3), told us by email, ""This isn't so much a criticism of the researchers ... but a fact that those who want to make sense of the findings should be aware of.""

The report included estimates that were adjusted to account for this issue, he said. According to the report, that adjustment made ""no change in the statistical significance of the estimates"" or ""the overall patterns found in the main analysis.""

Steve Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, raised the same concern. By email, he told us that in his view, it means ""the results of the study are somewhat misinterpreted"" and the effects of Head Start are underestimated. 
Overall, Love said, the comic strip’s description of the study was close but oversimplified. ""That is a fair summary of what they found, as far as it goes,"" he said, but it’s an inadequate description because there were some significant results within subgroups; for example, black 4-year-olds showed more improvement than their peers, with effects lasting until the end of third grade. Such findings, Love said, could help determine ""what works for whom under what conditions.""

Barnett said other research has yielded varied results. ""Some find that other studies are persuasive that Head Start has larger impacts, and there certainly are other studies that find these,"" he said. ""On the other side are people who would be closer to the duck.""

He emailed us his review of major U.S. and other studies on early educational intervention for children in poverty that appeared in the Aug. 19, 2011, issue of the international journal Science. There, Barnett considered decades of research showing that the Head Start study and three others all showed declining benefits to children as they got older.

In the Head Start study and Love’s Early Head Start study, Barnett wrote, effects ""start small and disappear shortly after school entry."" Two smaller and older studies showed effects that were ""relatively large and long-lasting,"" the review said: a mid-1960s look at Perry Preschool in Michigan and a late-’70s/early ‘80s examination of a North Carolina preschool program.

Barnett told us, however, that the longer-lasting benefits indicated by the older studies might reflect the fact that fewer children then had access to quality preschool or health insurance.

Our ruling

""Mallard Fillmore"" said a government study shows Head Start ""has little or no impact on the children it’s supposed to help.""

That could be an accurate description of the longer-term results -- relatively few positive outcomes and some negative ones -- measured at the end of first and third grades. Still, the Head Start children had significant advantages over their peers when they exited preschool and started kindergarten.

Jimmy Carter says when he ran against Gerald Ford, he didn't raise any money
","
During a recent interview with CNN’s Piers Morgan, former President Jimmy Carter made a striking claim about how presidential campaigns had changed since Carter first ran against President Gerald Ford in 1976.

Asked by Morgan about the challenges facing President Barack Obama, Carter said in the Feb. 21, 2013, interview that the presidency has ""changed dramatically. As a matter of fact, when I ran against incumbent President Gerald Ford, you know how much money we raised? None.""

Coming off a 2012 election in which Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney together raised in excess of $2 billion, that’s quite a difference. Is it correct?

We checked with campaign-finance experts, who explained how campaign finance was structured in 1976.

That was the first presidential election run under the post-Watergate amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act. Under this law, presidential candidates were able to receive a partial federal match for money they raised for the primary, up to $5 million. For the general election, candidates could receive full federal funding, up to $20 million, as long as they raised no private money for the general election and stuck to expenditure limits.

We were able to obtain original campaign-finance documentation during a visit to the public records room of the Federal Election Commission in Washington, D.C.

During the primary phase of the campaign, Carter raised $13.8 million. Of that, $3.5 million came from federal matching funds, and the remainder was raised privately. But since Carter wasn’t running against Ford at that point -- but rather such Democratic rivals as California Gov. Jerry Brown and the late Idaho Sen. Frank Church -- we don’t think these fundraising efforts undercut Carter’s claim of not raising money against Ford. (Interestingly, some of Carter’s biggest fundraising draws during the primaries were concerts by such Southern rock bands as the Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Marshall Tucker Band.)

What happened in the general election is the more relevant issue for judging the claim Carter made on CNN. Both he and Ford agreed to the expenditure limits, meaning they qualified for the $20 million in federal funds. By accepting the money, both candidates were legally barred from raising money for their official campaign committee.

On the surface, this supports Carter’s claim. ""No presidential candidate raised a dime for a general election campaign between Watergate and Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign,"" said Kenneth A. Gross, who practices political and election law for the firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP. ""Until 2008, every major-party general-election candidate was 100 percent publicly funded.""

But as is so often the case with campaign finance, there were some exceptions that make Carter’s claim an oversimplification. We learned about at least three ways in which Carter (or his ticket-mate, Walter Mondale, or other surrogates such as his wife Rosalynn) were allowed to raise money for the general election. The key is that this money had to go toward groups other than his own official presidential campaign committee.

• Fundraising for the Democratic National Committee and other party committees. The DNC, like its Republican equivalent, was allowed under the law to raise and spend $3 million on behalf of the Carter-Mondale ticket for the general election campaign.

News reports in October 1976 suggested tension between the Carter campaign and DNC chairman Robert Strauss due to the DNC’s inability to deliver all of the permitted $3 million to the presidential ticket.

Still, while not every fundraising effort for the DNC was headlined by Carter, ""we did raise money for the DNC up to the limit,"" said Peter G. Bourne, who served as Carter’s deputy campaign director in the general election as well as mid-Atlantic director and director of the Washington office during the primaries.

• Fundraising for an authorized ""compliance fund."" The law allowed the Carter campaign to collect money for a separate account called a ""compliance fund,"" which supported the campaign’s legal efforts to follow campaign finance laws. FEC data shows that the compliance fund collected more than $58,000 for the general election.

• Fundraising for down-ballot candidates. Bourne said the Carter campaign, and sometimes Carter himself, also raised money for House, Senate and other candidates. Media coverage backs this up. The New York Times reported that Carter himself attended, among other events, a rally in Norfolk, Va., in September; a fundraiser for Tennessee Democratic Senate candidate Jim Sasser; and a box-lunch fundraiser at the Hartford Civic Center in October.

In addition, in October, Mondale attended a fundraiser at the home of former Rep. Ogden R. Reid, D-N.Y., and a fundraising dinner in Essex County, N.J. And Rosalynn Carter narrated Aaron Copland's ""A Lincoln Portrait"" at an October fundraiser at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., in a joint appearance with Leonard Bernstein. She also appeared at a fundraising event for New York State Democrats in New York City’s Tavern on the Green.

Our ruling

Carter said on CNN that when he ran against Ford in 1976, ""you know how much money we raised? None.""

Carter is correct that, like every presidential candidate until Obama in 2008, he did not raise money for his own campaign committee for the general election, opting instead for federal funding that came with some strings. However, he exaggerates slightly by suggesting that he and his campaign raised no money during their general-election campaign against Ford. In fact, they did help raise money for the DNC, a compliance fund and for down-ballot candidates.

Mayor says felonies in Atlanta lowest in decades
","
Kasim Reed successfully campaigned for mayor in 2009 with the goal of making Atlanta a safer city.

In his recent State of the City speech before hundreds of business leaders and elected officials from across the region, Reed was very specific about the drop in major crimes last year.  

""Felony crimes are at the lowest they have been since 1969,"" the mayor said.

This claim was listed second in a glossy pamphlet called ""30 Accomplishments in 3 Years"" with Reed’s picture on it.

Since public safety is such an important issue and Reed has highlighted this as an accomplishment, PolitiFact Georgia thought it would be worthwhile to fact-check whether the claim is correct.

Felony crimes consist of murder, rape, aggravated assault, robbery, burglary, larceny and auto theft. The FBI keeps data on felonies and other crimes that are collected from police agencies nationwide, and it puts them into an annual report. They are included in the FBI’s Part I crimes category.

Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said the claim was focused on the total number of felony crimes in the city in 2012. He forwarded us a report full of statistics that included felony crime totals from 1960 to 2010. Campos also gave us felony crime totals for 2011 and 2012.

The Police Department’s and FBI’s totals matched most years. The FBI does not have complete Atlanta data for 2012.

In 1969, Atlanta had 32,095 felony crimes. The total rose to slightly more than 40,000 in 1970 and nearly 50,000 by 1976. Felony crimes hit their zenith in 1989, when the total was 88,241. The annual totals have steadily declined since then. There have been a few years in the past decade in which the total was below 40,000. None, though, were as low as the 2012 total of 34,581.

As far as the annual totals, the city’s numbers are correct.

Why is there a decrease?

Police departments across the country have reported a drop in crime in recent years. Washington, for example, was on pace in 2012 to have its lowest number of murders in nearly 50 years. New York City police report a major decline in homicides from 2,262 in 1990 to 515 in 2011. In 2011, the most recent year available, FBI data show violent and property crimes nationwide declined for the fifth year in a row.

Atlanta Police Chief George Turner told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that his department, like many law enforcement agencies, uses computer mapping to determine crime trends and deploy officers to areas where there is a spike in criminal activity. The department also reconfigured the boundaries of its beats so officers would have less territory to cover, used video surveillance as a crime-fighting tool and has more cops on the force, which Turner believes are additional factors in the drop in crime.

PolitiFact Georgia has examined Atlanta crime statistics before, and we note that crime statistics are difficult to cross-check. Independent researchers or agencies don’t typically do separate tallies or check the quality of crime statistics.

For a period starting in 1999, the department failed to count about 6 percent of rape reports. In 2003, an audit found that police were unable to find about 20,000 reports from the prior year. Rapes and robberies went unreported in the late 1990s as well.

We do note that there is no evidence that the city is currently underreporting its crime statistics.

One news site, Business Insider, analyzed the FBI crime data for 2011 and ranked Atlanta as the eighth-most-dangerous city in the U.S. by calculating Atlanta’s violent crime rate and comparing it with other cities. The FBI advises against ranking agencies ""[s]ince crime is a sociological phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors.""

We did decide to take a closer look at Atlanta’s felony crime rate to see whether it is also at its lowest level since 1969.

We used the FBI’s formula for calculating the felony crime rate. We divided the number of felony crimes by the city’s population for a particular year and multiplied that by 100,000.

PolitiFact Georgia must note a caveat about Atlanta’s population estimates. As estimates, they can vary. We all believed Atlanta’s population rose sharply between 2000 and 2009, particularly after 2005. In 2009, Atlanta’s population was estimated at nearly 553,000 residents. Then the U.S. Census Bureau released its 2010 population estimate for Atlanta, which was done with the help of more counters than prior years. The total? An estimated 420,000.

In 2011, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigated why there was such a huge change in one year. The AJC found that a successful appeal by Fulton County government to the Census Bureau resulted in its 2005 population estimate rising by nearly 100,000 residents. Atlanta’s population estimate rose that year by about 55,000 residents. The city appealed its estimate in 2006, and the Census Bureau agreed to increase its population by an additional 12,000 residents.

For our fact check, we used the adjusted census population estimates from 2000 to 2009, which were more conservative than the information used after the appeals.

The Atlanta Regional Commission estimates the city’s population at 421,600 in 2012. Using that estimate, we found two years (1970 and 1971) in which there was a lower felony crime rate than 2012. The differences between those two years and 2012, though, was pretty small.

The most recent census population estimate for Atlanta was 432,427 in 2011. If we use that population estimate for 2012, that year wins as the city’s lowest felony crime rate. The Census Bureau’s 2012 estimate will not come out until March, we were told. Census estimates usually rise each year.

Our conclusion:

The mayor and city officials say felony crime is at its lowest since 1969. Indeed, the number of reported felony crimes is at its lowest since 1969. It’s possible the felony crime rate was slightly lower in 1970 or 1971. It’s possible, though, that the felony crime rate was lower in 2012.

Since it is possible the felony crime rate was lower in 2012, we’re not going to quibble about 1970 or 1971. Our rating: True.",/factchecks/2013/feb/26/kasim-reed/mayor-says-felonies-atlanta-lowest-decades/

Sen. Bill Nelson says 2011 budget deal included immediate cuts
","
As Washington wrangles over how to avoid the sequester, Florida Sen. Bill Nelson spoke with a Central Florida news station to help explain the issue — and now viewers question his accuracy.

Anchor Ybeth Bruzual had asked Nelson, a Democrat, about mandatory budget cuts set to go into effect March 1: ""How did we get to this point?""

Here’s what he told viewers of Central Florida News 13, a partner of PolitiFact Florida:

""Well, a year and a half ago, when the country, in order to pay its bills, (and we) had to raise the artificial statutory debt ceiling so the country could pay its bills, a deal was struck: a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately, and then a special committee was set up. They were to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts.

""Hanging over their head was a meat cleaver called the sequester, that was going to be, across the board, over a trillion dollars of additional cuts, but without a scalpel — a meat cleaver. Nobody ever expected the sequester to go into effect. It was never supposed to. It was the onerous alternative that would force the super-committee to come to agreement.""

Nelson’s right that the sequester’s across-the-board cuts don’t allow for much fine distinction.

But was Nelson correct that the 2011 budget deal included ""a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately, and then a special committee was set up ... to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts""?

 Budget Control Act of 2011

Some viewers argued the cuts Nelson described as going into effect ""immediately"" were limits on future growth, hardly immediate.

Here’s the deal: In summer 2011, the federal government was reaching its legal debt limit, which meant Congress had to authorize a higher level for borrowing to cover its spending. House Republicans insisted that spending cuts go along with an increase to the debt limit. After rancorous debate, lawmakers passed the Budget Control Act of 2011.

The law set up caps on future discretionary spending that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would reduce spending by about a trillion dollars between 2012 and 2021, compared with what it would have been if annual appropriations grew at the rate of inflation.

The cuts weren’t specified, but would be carried out by lawmakers during the annual appropriations process, with a trigger for across-the-board cuts if they busted the caps. (There were exceptions for certain kinds of spending, such as for war or disasters.)

That’s not exactly the same as ""a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately.""

The law also established a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, the ""special committee"" that Nelson mentioned. The Budget Control Act required a 12-member panel, half from each party, to suggest legislation to reduce the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion over 10 years.

If that process failed — and it did — the law required the sequester. That’s what happens March 1 if Washington does nothing.

Nelson said ""$3 trillion of cuts"" -- not $1.2 trillion.

His press secretary, Ryan Brown, noted ""there was no specific amount the committee had to cut in the legislation, or a limit to how much they could cut.""

That’s true if you mean cuts in spending, rather than cuts in the deficit — the law required the committee to achieve at least $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction, not necessarily spending cuts. Raising taxes would also reduce the deficit.

Brown explained that Nelson had hoped the committee ""would do another $1.5 trillion to $3 trillion in deficit reduction.""

But that’s not what Nelson said. He told TV viewers the committee was set up ""to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts,"" as though that were part of the deal reached by lawmakers in the Budget Control Act.

There was a $3 trillion proposal floating around at the time. It was a deal offered to the deficit reduction committee in October 2011 by congressional Democrats.

Even that proposal, as it was described in news accounts, didn’t include $3 trillion in spending cuts,  Rather, it was a package that included cuts, tax increases and new spending that would have trimmed $3 trillion from federal deficits over a decade.

Republican House Speaker John Boehner rejected the offer.

 Our ruling

Nelson said the 2011 budget deal included ""a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately, and then a special committee ... to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts."" 
Nelson missed some things here. 
The trillion dollars in savings in the Budget Control Act take place over 10 years (not immediately), and must be implemented by lawmakers through the annual appropriations process.

Meanwhile, the committee charged with further cutting the deficit had to reduce it by $1.2 trillion to avoid the sequester, not get agreement on $3 trillion in cuts, as Nelson said.

He’s partially accurate, but misses some important details. We find his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2013/feb/25/bill-nelson/sen-bill-nelson-says-2011-budget-deal-included-imm/

Broun claims parallel to Ron Paul’s voting record
","
Outspoken Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Broun announced earlier this month his intentions to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Georgia Republican Saxby Chambliss.

Since announcing, Broun has been careful to publicly present himself as a collegial congressman. In public comments, Broun has touted his willingness to work with more liberal lawmakers to solve some of the country’s biggest problems. This is a far cry from Broun’s typical fiery demeanor and anti-Obama rhetoric that has come to symbolize his congressional leadership.

In a fundraiser letter that surfaced recently, Broun went back to his roots. The four-page letter includes a rant against President Barack Obama and other Democratic leaders for ""running roughshod"" over the Constitution. In the letter, Broun makes a point of emphatically laying out his conservative beliefs and voting record. He also calls other conservatives like former Florida congressman Allen West and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky his friends.

Broun also aligns himself with Rand Paul’s father, former Texas congressman and Libertarian Ron Paul: ""Truth be told,"" Broun says in the letter, ""except for foreign policy, Ron Paul’s voting record and mine are virtually identical.""

Politicians frequently align themselves with other party favorites, with varying results. PolitiFact Georgia examined whether Broun was correct about his voting record, and similarity to Ron Paul.

Both Broun and Paul have embraced conservative positions on issues such as the role of government and government spending. In addition to their political opinions, the men share medical backgrounds. Paul was a military flight surgeon who went on to become an obstetrician-gynecologist. Broun practiced general medicine and operated a business based strictly on house calls.

Paul served in the U.S. House on three separate occasions. His latest term, from 1997 to 2013, overlapped about six years with Broun’s congressional tenure, which began in 2007.

Using the congressional tracking site, VoteSmart.org, PolitiFact reviewed 383 votes made by both men during their concurrent time in office, beginning in July 2007. That search revealed 42 times that the congressmen voted different ways on the same bill. Taking into account Broun’s foreign policy caveat, the number drops to 23 opposing votes. PolitiFact Georgia assumed votes involving defense topics as foreign policy.

Based on those numbers, 6 percent of votes cast by Broun differed from those cast by Paul.

We called and emailed questions about the letter to Broun’s staff for comment, but received no response.

""Paul has this image of being conservative, so it’s not surprising that they would agree on many things except foreign policy,"" said Kennesaw State University professor Kerwin Swint. ""On foreign policy, Paul is to the left of Obama.""

Last week, TheTeaParty.net, a conservative grassroots group, endorsed Broun in the U.S. Senate race. Broun will be up against well-funded ""establishment moderates"" and ""deep-pocketed country club fundraisers like Karl Rove,"" organization founder Todd Cefaratti said in a news release, but that Broun’s campaign will have the support of thousands of citizens worried about the country’s future.

Broun said except for foreign policy, his voting record and Ron Paul’s voting record were virtually identical. The men’s congressional terms overlapped from 2007 to January 2013. During that time, PolitiFact Georgia found that the congressmen’s votes differed just 6 percent of the time after the foreign policy exclusion.

We rated Broun’s statement True.

Peter Barca says visitors can bring a gun but not pencil and paper to Assembly gallery
","Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca was railing against Assembly Republicans during an interview on Feb. 19, 2013.

""Step by step by step, they're dismantling people's involvement in their democracy. And I think it's wrong,"" the Kenosha Democrat told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board.

Then Barca made a startling claim about rules in the Assembly gallery, where the general public can watch the Assembly in action.

""You can't bring an iPad or a piece of paper and a pencil in the gallery to take notes of what's going on. That's outrageous,"" he charged. ""But, yet you can bring a gun up there. It doesn't even equate. You can exercise your Second Amendment rights, but not your First Amendment rights.""

So, citizens who want to observe their elected representatives at the state Capitol can bring a firearm into the Assembly gallery -- but not an iPad or a pencil and paper?

Was Barca going ballistic?

Let's lock and load the Truth-O-Meter.

New rules

In January 2013, about a month before Barca made his claim, he and GOP Assembly Speaker Robin Vos announced they had agreed on new operating procedures for the Legislature's lower chamber.

Most any bipartisan agreement would be news, given that Republicans control the Assembly and Senate and hold the governor’s office.

In an effort to avoid all-night sessions, the two Assembly leaders said they would meet before each Assembly session to set time limits on debate for each bill. And they'd use a time clock for each speech.

But separate from the bipartisan deal, the Republican majority in the Assembly adopted stricter rules on members of the public in the Assembly's overhead viewing galleries. No recording devices, signs or hats would be allowed, the Journal Sentinel reported.

And remaining in place from the 2011-2012 legislative session was a provision allowing people with a valid permit to carry concealed weapons in the Assembly gallery.

(The Senate, by the way, prohibits guns -- as well as laptops, still photography and video or audio recordings -- in its gallery.)

The Assembly’s new prohibitions on recording devices were decried by Bill Lueders, president of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, a nonprofit group dedicated to open government. He noted in an opinion article that the Open Meetings Law passed by the Legislature in 1977 directs all state and local governmental bodies in Wisconsin to ""make a reasonable effort to accommodate any person desiring to record, film or photograph the meeting,"" so long as this does not cause disruption.

How common are these various restrictions in public galleries in legislative chambers?

Angela Andrews of the National Conference of State Legislatures told us she was not aware of any state legislative body that prohibits pencils and paper, and not aware of any that prohibits audio and video recording devices. Fewer than 10 state capitol buildings allow guns, she said.

Barca’s claim

So, it’s clear Barca is correct in saying guns are allowed in the audience gallery of the Assembly; no change has been made since that rule took effect in the previous legislative session.

But what about the other two parts of his claim?

Check two portions of the Legislative Reference Bureau’s summary of Assembly Resolution 4, the new rules adopted by the GOP majority in January 2013:

""No individual may do any of the following in the visitor galleries: lean over or put any object over the balcony; use a laptop or other computer device; stand except for prayer or pledge of allegiance or as otherwise permitted by the presiding officer; use recording devices of any kind; use cell phones or pagers ….""

The laptop or computer device part pretty clearly prohibits the iPad, Apple’s mobile computing device, in the Assembly gallery.

""No individual in the visitor galleries may use any audio or video device to record, photograph, film, videotape, or in any way depict the proceedings on or about the Assembly floor.""

That’s an explicit ban on devices, but there’s no reference to jotting notes.

Barca spokeswoman Melanie Conklin told us that Barca’s key point in making his claim was that ""there is a lengthy list of items and behaviors – many of them not remotely disruptive – that are banned in the gallery or were discussed in meetings and in the floor speeches as being disruptive, while a visitor can bring a weapon into the gallery with no repercussions.""

Kit Beyer, spokeswoman for GOP speaker Vos, told us of the new rules: ""Nowhere does it say that an observer in the gallery cannot have a piece of paper or a pencil.""

Aiming for clarity on the pencil and paper question, we checked with experts.

Madison attorney Christa Westerberg, vice president of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, said it’s not clear that the new rules would prohibit a pencil and paper in the gallery for taking notes.

Chris Ahmuty, the non-lawyer executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, said he has concerns about the new gallery rules but doesn’t think they prohibit a pencil and paper.

But Madison media lawyer Robert Dreps had a different take. He said it’s possible to construe a pencil as a recording device.

More importantly, nobody but the Assembly can say what its rules actually mean.

""Because it’s a legislative rule, it means, ultimately, what the Legislature says it means,"" Dreps said.   
Our rating

Barca claimed: ""You can't bring an iPad or a piece of paper and a pencil in the (Assembly) gallery to take notes of what's going on,"" but ""you can bring a gun up there.""

He is right that the Assembly audience gallery allows guns and not iPads, but it’s debatable at best whether he’s right that Assembly rules prohibit a pencil and paper.

"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Barbara Buono']","
Barbara Buono claims New Jersey has lost half its pharma jobs to other high-tax states
","
New Jersey’s pharmaceutical industry is suffering from some aches and pains.

Thousands of industry jobs have disappeared from the Garden State, according to state Sen. Barbara Buono, who discussed the issue during her Jan. 28 appearance on NJTV’s NJToday.

""New Jersey has lost over half of our pharmaceutical jobs to states you know, not low-tax states like in the South, but high-tax states like New York,"" said Buono (D-Middlesex), who also is running for governor.

Buono’s claim is largely correct.

Let’s look at what’s going on here before addressing where any jobs have gone.

Buono spokesman David Turner said Buono’s statement refers to New Jersey’s percentage of pharma jobs nationwide lost since 1990. Accordingly, we reviewed U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data to compare state and national numbers from December 1990 to December 2012.

New Jersey had 42,300 pharma jobs in December 1990. The nation had 210,400. So New Jersey’s share was 20.1 percent.

In December 2012 New Jersey had 28,100 pharma jobs, compared with 275,100 nationally. That means the state’s share was 10.2 percent.

So Buono is close to her claim that New Jersey lost ""more than half"" its pharma jobs.

Next, let’s review where the lost New Jersey pharma jobs are going.

James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said New Jersey has lost life sceinces jobs largely because the industry has a new business model for a new type of research and drug development.

""Pharma is putting its cutting edge facilities near university centers of excellence in the life sciences, such as Cambridge, Bay Area, San Diego, etc.,"" Hughes said in an e-mail. ""They want to be in interactive environments, not in insulated suburban facilities. This is the new business model for bio-based drug development. NJ specialized in chemical based drug development. The environments that pharma now wants are all high tax and high cost environments. They are willing to pay any price to be near centers of research excellence, leading scientists, and the leading hospitals for clinical trials.""

Dean J. Paranicas, president and CEO of the HealthCare Institute of New Jersey, a trade association that represents the life sciences industry, said infrastructure, government support and high-tech capabilities at higher education institutions also are factors.

""New Jersey is in competition with every state regardless of its tax structure because the life sciences industry is a highly coveted one,"" Paranicas said.

Mergers among major pharma companies are another reason for the smaller workforce in life sciences.

Within the past few years, Manhattan-based Pfizer bought Madison-based Wyeth; Merck merged with Schering-Plough and cut 15 percent of its workforce; and Roche has moved some jobs to both California and New York City.

A 2011 report from the state Labor Department points out that the recession, cost-cutting measures and expiration of patents also factored into industry job losses.

""Senator Buono attributes this trend to many factors including the Governor’s unwillingness to fully fund our education system and lack of leadership in creating research partnerships similar to other states,"" Turner said in an e-mail. ""Pharmaceutical companies are moving to states with equally high taxes but provide more funding for research and development. In places such as California, Massachusetts, and New York, companies are clearly attracted to the concentration of well-regarded universities that have forged partnerships with private industry.""

Hughes and Paranicas said the merger of Rutgers, Rowan and the University of Medicine and Dentistry New Jersey is important for the industry’s needs in high-tech research.

Our ruling

Buono said during a recent appearance on NJToday that ""New Jersey has lost over half of our pharmaceutical jobs to states you know, not low-tax states like in the South, but high-tax states like New York.""

She’s correct that New Jersey has lost pharma jobs, but it’s not the ""more than half"" that she claimed.

Jobs have been lost for a variety of reasons, from the industry’s new business model to wanting to be near universities and hospitals of excellence, and more.

We rate this claim Mostly True.

Gary Sasse says 90 percent of $35 million in tax credits went to CVS and two out-of-state companies
","
In the debate over taxes  -- which ones to cut and which ones to raise -- any proposed change would result in winners and losers.

During a discussion of taxes on the Feb. 10 edition of WJAR-TV's ""10 News Conference,"" host Jim Taricani asked how taxes could be cut while still financing the services that governments need to perform.

Gary Sasse, director of the Hassenfeld Institute for Public Leadership at Bryant University, said people need to be talking ""about tax reform, not just tax cutting, the same debate that's going on nationally.""

""You asked why it's so expensive to live here. Well, we don't invest in things that will grow the economy [like] higher education,"" he said. ""We have such an inbred system of crony capitalism that we have tax loopholes that make no sense. Good sound tax policy is lowering rates and not having government pick winners and losers by favoritism.""

Taricani asked Sasse if he was referring to ""tax breaks for CVS and other types of things?""

""Absolutely,"" said Sasse. ""There was a study put out by the Division of Taxation. They only looked at six of our tax credits that totaled about $35 million, $36 million. Three companies got 90 percent of that -- CVS and two companies not even located in the state of Rhode Island. They were in California.""

Ninety percent of the tax credits were going to CVS and two California companies?

We went to the Division of Taxation website and found the report Sasse was talking about.

The division is required by law to report on six incentive programs, even though one was repealed in 2009 and the other is phasing out.

The remaining four distributed $34.4 million in tax credits (not quite $35 million but close enough) to 39 entities.

But one Woonsocket company, the pharmacy giant CVS Caremark, with a net after-tax income of $3.9 billion in 2012, got 59 percent of it.

CVS got $4.9 million from the state through the Economic Development Corporation Project Status program, in which the EDC waives the sales tax for construction projects. (Only projects approved before July 1, 2011, could qualify.)

CVS got another $15.4 million under the Jobs Development Act, which allows for a reduction in a company's corporate income tax rate if it creates and maintains a certain number of jobs.

Total: just over $20 million.

But wait, as the TV commercials say, there's more. Any entity that receives one of the six credits is required to disclose any other credits it gets from the state.

During that fiscal year, CVS received an additional $4.4 million from four tax credits; nearly all of it from a $4.3-million state investment tax credit, which is designed to encourage investment in buildings and equipment.

And what about the two out-of-state companies that Sasse was talking about?

Both benefited from the controversial motion picture production tax-credit program, which was designed to encourage TV, motion picture and video production in Rhode Island.

The credit can help production companies reduce their Rhode Island taxes. More often, those companies can raise money by selling unused tax credits -- typically through brokers -- to companies or individuals that owe Rhode Island taxes but have nothing to do with the entertainment business.

The biggest tax credit for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, was an $8.1-million break to Paige Productions Inc. of Burbank, Calif., which was producing the ABC medical drama ""Body of Proof"" and filmed its initial episodes in Rhode Island.

Another $2.9 million went to Moonrise LLC of Santa Monica, Calif., the production company that filmed ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" a movie that has been nominated for an Academy Award in the best original screenplay category and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category of best motion picture musical or comedy.

Add them all together and you have three companies garnering $31.3 million of the $34.5 million in tax credits -- or 90.1 percent.

""Keep in mind: that report is only dealing with six tax credits. There are others,"" Sasse said. ""We ought to expand that report to look at more tax credits.""

Are these tax breaks worth the lost revenue? That’s a matter of opinion that we wouldn’t rule on. But we will remind readers that a PolitiFact Rhode Island article from Dec. 19, 2010, noted that there is a lot of debate over the real value of the motion picture production tax credit.

The Rhode Island Department of Revenue was supposed to issue an evaluation of the incentives in January of 2012 but that report is still being prepared. We asked the Chafee administration for an explanation for the delay but didn't get a response.

Our ruling

Gary Sasse said that among six Rhode Island tax-credit programs worth about $35 million, ""three companies got 90 percent of that -- CVS and two companies not even located in the state of Rhode Island.""

Sasse is rounding off some large numbers but he was, in essence, correctly quoting the state report he was citing. We rate the claim True.

"['Oregon', 'Elections', 'Pensions', 'Retirement', 'State Budget', 'Transparency', 'Tim Knopp']","
Did Tim Knopp honor his pledge to eschew PERS?
","
Freshman Oregon Sen. Tim Knopp, R-Bend, is clear that lawmakers need to fix the Public Employees Retirement System this year, and that they themselves should not be part of the system. He pledged during his campaign to decline membership in PERS.

Earlier this month, Knopp’s office issued a press release saying that along with being sworn into office, ""he upheld a campaign promise not to join the state retirement program known as the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS).""

""It is very important to me to honor the promises that I’ve made,"" Knopp is quoted as saying in the release. ""If we don’t fix PERS now there will be fewer firefighters protecting our communities, fewer police officers on the streets, and fewer teachers in the classroom.""

 PERS is contentious. Lawmakers reformed the system in 2003, curbing benefits for new employees going forward. Some lawmakers say it’s still too generous. Public employee unions are firm that the benefits were bargained for and are fair.

Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat, wants to find savings in the system, as do Republicans; House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, is lukewarm to the idea. Public employees generally favor Democrats with campaign help and money, so it’s not surprising to hear that Knopp, a Republican, promised to opt out.

But PolitiFact Oregon also recalled that before he joined the Senate this year, Knopp was a three-term member of the Oregon House. In fact, he was House majority leader when lawmakers tackled reform in 2003. We were pretty sure he had been a member of PERS.

Knopp’s office confirmed what we thought to be true. He joined the system in 1999, when he was first elected to the House, and remained an active member until 2005, when he left office. As a member for six years, he was vested in the system. The money continued accruing until 2010.

What happened in 2010? Knopp needed money for a family medical emergency, so he cashed out his account. The total gross amount was $8,167.07, which we acknowledge is not an astonishingly high figure. Retirement benefits are calculated based on pay, and length of service, and legislators don’t earn much, about $20,000 a year.

Still, we think his previous membership is a relevant detail curiously missing from an otherwise glowing press release. If PolitiFact Oregon were in office and had made public employee retirement a major part of our platform and had promised to opt out, we think we’d make it explicit that we had once been part of PERS, in the interest of full and complete disclosure.

In any case, Knopp had three options when he was sworn into office this year: Join the Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan, which is the pension system he’s complaining about; join the Oregon Savings Growth Plan, which is like any other deferred compensation plan; or decline to join a retirement plan.

Knopp chose the deferred compensation plan. The state -- his employer, the taxpayers -- contributes 6 percent to his plan. The state does not ""pick up"" the additional 6 percent of salary on behalf of employees, as it would under PERS.

We had two questions for the senator from Central Oregon: One, why not publicize the fact that he was a member -- for more than a decade -- of the system he is now criticizing? And two, why take a retirement option at all?

Let’s take the retirement question first. Knopp told PolitiFact Oregon that he’s not opposed to compensation for legislators. He just doesn’t want them to vote on a system in which they have a stake. To that end, he has co-sponsored a bill to prohibit future legislators from joining PERS or the deferred compensation plan, because they shouldn’t ""be forced to be in the system,"" as he was.

""Actual or perceived, there needs to be somebody who completely represents citizens and taxpayers, without a conflict,"" he said.

As to the first question, Knopp said he disclosed his previous membership on the campaign trail. When his Democratic challenger said Knopp was a PERS member at an October 2012 candidates’ forum, he said, ""I closed my account years ago, honestly, to pay some medical bills when my daughter had two brain surgeries.""

We get that the retirement system in 1999 was not the legislative issue that it was in 2003 or that it is in 2013. But why didn’t he close his account before 2003, when it was clear he’d have to vote on PERS reforms? He said it wasn’t clear at the time whether he could..

Why not close the account in 2005, after leaving office? He said he co-sponsored a bill in 2003 that offered a financial incentive for people with inactive accounts to close their accounts. He thought it unseemly to benefit from that legislation -- although we checked, and he wouldn’t have qualified.

Then why wait until 2010 to close his account? Knopp didn’t have a clear answer. He acknowledges that had he not needed the money in 2010, he would have continued to be a member.

Knopp has been a consistent and outspoken critic of the Public Employees Retirement System. He served as the House chairman of the committee to reform PERS in 2003. He promised voters that he would not accept PERS this year and he followed through on the promise.

What Knopp failed to mention is that he was a member of PERS who closed his account in 2010 because his family needed the money. Knopp could have closed his account in 2003 -- and avoided the conflict then -- or he could have closed his account when he left office in 2005.

None of that takes away from the accuracy of the statement -- he honored his pledge to stay out of PERS -- but it is additional information that we deem missing from his press releases.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

Barack Obama says sequester could force prosecutors to 'let criminals go'
","
To pressure Congress to prevent the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration by the March 1, 2013, deadline, President Barack Obama gave a speech on Feb. 19 warning of dire consequences if it takes effect. 
""Emergency responders like the ones who are here today -- their ability to help communities respond to and recover from disasters will be degraded,"" Obama said. ""Border Patrol agents will see their hours reduced. FBI agents will be furloughed. Federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go."" 
As we’ve noted, dire warnings about budget cuts are a popular tactic in the nation's capital. They’re sometimes known as the ""Washington Monument strategy"" because federal agencies threaten to close popular things, such as the monument, as a way of building public opposition. 
Still, the idea of letting criminals go is particularly scary, so we wondered whether it’s accurate for Obama to say that under a sequester, ""federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go."" 
First, let’s recap how the sequester works. Unless a deal is struck, most types of federal spending must be cut by a uniform amount -- tentatively 7.9 percent for most types of defense discretionary funding and 5.3 percent for non-defense discretionary funding. (Certain programs are shielded from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs. Medicare would be cut by 2 percent.) 
The uniform cuts must be applied to any ""program, project or activity"" that isn’t otherwise exempted. 
The most obvious way the sequester could produce cutbacks in prosecutions is through the Department of Justice’s budgetary line, ""Salaries and Expenses, United States Attorneys."" According to the Office of Management and Budget, the amount in that category that is subject to the sequester is $1.9 billion. Assuming a 5.3 percent cut, that works out to about a $101 million reduction. 
The sequester would affect ""every district, reducing the number of cases they can prosecute,"" the Justice Department said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""The Justice Department anticipates U.S. Attorneys’ Offices will handle 1,600 fewer civil cases and 1,000 fewer criminal cases. Fewer affirmative civil and criminal cases will affect our ability to ensure that justice is served and impact funds owed to the government."" 
Outside experts agree the cuts will be real. ""It’s certainly a fair statement that budgetary constraints affect who gets prosecuted and what gets prosecuted,"" said Mary Graw Leary, a Catholic University of America law professor. ""It’s fair to think there will be an effect on what cases will be pursued if there is a drastic contraction in budgets."" 
That said, there are reasons to be cautious in jumping to conclusions: 
• Officials will have some discretion about how to make the cuts. Within a given program, officials don’t have to cut every line item equally. They can move money around within a program. 
In fact, Obama’s deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jeffrey Zients, wrote a memo on Jan. 14, 2013, offering ""guiding principles"" for federal managers to use as they make cuts such as minimizing impacts on the agency’s core mission, life, safety and health. To limit the most severe impacts, Zients urged managers to consider hiring freezes, releasing temporary employees, not renewing contract hires, and authorizing early buyouts. 
So officials at the Justice Department will have flexibility about how to meet that $101 million target. They could focus their resources on, say, criminal cases rather than civil cases, or violent crimes as opposed to property crimes. They could focus dollars on locations where crime is growing and trim in places where it is declining. They could allocate less money to complicated, expensive, long-term cases as a way of getting more bang for the buck. 
• Obama is exaggerating. Saying the sequester would mean letting criminals go is a stretch. 
For starters, Obama’s comment conjures images of prison gates being thrown open and inmates flooding out. That’s not the case. When the New York Times asked the Justice Department about the sequester’s impact on prisons, a spokeswoman said that the Bureau of Prisons ""does not intend to let anyone go on March 1 because of the cuts."" The spokeswoman said that instead, personnel could be furloughed and that vocational education programs and others might be curtailed to meet sequester requirements. 
Meanwhile, there are plenty of ways to cut back prosecutions without letting criminals go. A U.S. attorney’s office could save money by slowing its uptake of new cases and focusing instead on clearing its backlog of existing cases. Or it could scale back investigations that haven’t even produced any ""criminals"" yet. 
Finally, we shouldn’t gloss over the reality that, by framing it as he did, Obama ignored the bedrock of America’s criminal justice system -- that people are innocent until proven guilty. The cuts Obama is talking about would affect the investigatory and trial stage, when an individual’s criminality hasn’t yet been proven. At most, the sequester would force prosecutors to let ""suspects"" or ""targets"" go. 
• Budgetary factors have always shaped prosecutorial priorities. ""It is not unusual for budgetary concerns to influence federal prosecutors' case selection,"" said Josh Bowers, a law professor at the University of Virginia. ""It strikes me that limited resources are typically a significant -- if not the principal -- determinant of how prosecutors exercise charging discretion."" 
In other words, the scope of the cuts may be somewhat bigger under a sequester, but living within budgetary limits isn't anything new for a seasoned prosecutor. 
Our ruling 
Obama said that, if the sequester hits, ""federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go."" 
It’s clear that U.S. Attorney’s offices are looking at a potential cut of $101 million, and a reduction of that size would almost certainly cut back on prosecutions in some fashion. However, the impacts are not as clear-cut as Obama’s bold language suggests. Officials will have a fair amount of discretion in prioritizing what types of cases prosecutors will pursue, possibly cutting back on civil cases rather than criminal ones. And the cuts taking place in U.S. Attorney's offices wouldn't directly affect ""criminals"" at all, but rather suspects and targets of prosecution who haven't had their guilt determined yet. These represent significant exaggerations, so we rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/feb/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-sequester-could-force-prosecutor/

The Ohio Republican Party says Kewpee burgers would be even more of a bargain under Gov. John Kasich's proposed sales tax cut
","
Sampling the local fare is a staple on the menu of any politician worth his salt.
For that reason alone, John Kasich is fortunate to be governor of Ohio.

Ohio is the brass buckle on the burger belt. It is Ground Beef Zero.

It is Mondo Carne.

Rivals stake competing claims, but Ohio can credit two brothers from Akron, Charles and Frank Menches, for inventing and naming the hamburger in 1885. Menches Brothers Restaurants still feature the original recipe.

The oldest burger chain, White Castle, is headquartered in Columbus, not far from the home of Wendy's in Dublin. The founder of the Carl's Jr. and Hardee' chains came from Upper Sandusky. The Big Boy, ""a meal in one on a double-deck bun,"" was created as the first double-decker in California, but Manners' in Cleveland and Frisch's in Cincinnati gave it white sauce perfection, inspiring the Big Mac.

And so on.

When Kasich took his State of the State address on the road last week to Lima, he made a stop that followed the lead of other visitors and then tweeted about it: ""Enjoyed a quick Kewpee burger before the State of the State in Lima tonight.""

The Ohio Republican Party tweeted its own comment: ""Kewpie burgers are delicious. An Ohio institution. And they'll cost less thanks to John Kasich's tax cut.""

Is that true -- or  a whopper? PolitiFact Ohio dug in with relish.

First, we will stipulate that Kewpee burgers are delicious and worthy of the restaurant's slogan: ""Hamburger pickle on top! Makes your heart go flippity flop!""

We agree that the diner is an Ohio institution, even though @ohiogop misspelled its name. One of the oldest burger chains in the country, Kewpee was started in Michigan (Wendy’s founder Dave Thomas once said that the Kewpee near his home in Michigan inspired him to go into the business) but has its headquarters in Lima. Its downtown location is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Kasich's ""tax cut"" cited by @ohiogop is the sales tax plan that is part of the governor's proposed two-year budget. To help pay for a 20 percent cut in the state's income tax, the plan would cut the state sales tax rate, from 5.5 percent to 5 percent, while widening its scope to nearly all service purchases.

Restaurant meals -- such as Kasich's pre-speech Kewpee burger -- are covered by the sales tax. Take-out meals are not taxed, and would not be under Kasich's proposal.

In Allen County, where Lima is located, state and county taxes combine for a 6.5 percent sales tax rate, the Ohio Department of Taxation told us. Under Kasich's plan, the rate would drop to 5.8 percent.

That would cut the tax on a plain Kewpee burger -- priced at $1.80 each -- from 12 cents to 10 cents, according to the tax collection schedule posted by the Department of Taxation.

So what's the take-away?

It is accurate to say that a delicious burger eaten at the iconic Kewpee in Lima would cost 2 cents less under Kasich's tax proposal, leaving all other factors unchanged. Someone eating two burgers a week would save enough in 10 months to buy another burger.

The price of take-out burgers would remain the same, however. That’s an important clarification that gives the statement a rating of Mostly True.

Do places with domestic partnerships have fewer marriages?
","
Florida lawmakers heard a bill that would allow couples who live together anywhere in the state to register for a domestic partnership, a designation that would afford them some of the same rights as married couples.

The outlook for SB 196 isn’t promising. Social conservatives control the Capitol, Florida voters enacted a ban on gay marriage in the state Constitution, and bill sponsor Sen. Eleanor Sobel, D-Hollywood, could not get enough votes to move her measure out of her committee.

Sobel called it the ""shacking up"" bill because it would benefit all couples, both gay and straight, who live together but choose not to marry. Sobel’s domestic partnership bill would eliminate the patchwork of 18 registries enacted by counties such as Orange, Pinellas, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, and cities such as St. Petersburg, Tampa, Clearwater, North Miami  and Miami Beach.

Proponents testified before the Senate Children, Families and Elder Affairs Committee on Feb. 19, 2013, sharing stories about not being able to be with their partner at the hospital because they were not married.

On the other side, members of religious groups, including Michael Sheedy, Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops public policy director, testified that the law would diminish traditional marriage.

""In other jurisdictions where this has been enacted, we have seen that fewer people enter into marriage,"" Sheedy said. ""They take it less seriously, it has less value in the minds of some.""

Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, asked Sheedy for more information about his claim that the number of marriages falls in places where domestic partnerships are in place. Sheedy said Spain came to mind. Clemens pressed him for any examples in the United States, and Sheedy said he could not think of any off the top of his head.

We also wanted to know more about Sheedy’s statement. In a phone conversation the next day, he acknowledged not finding data about this happening in the United States. He did send us a few links from religious groups about the effect of gay marriage laws on traditional marriage in Spain and the Netherlands.

""While other factors such as growing unemployment played a role, there is a strong case that redefining marriage is mostly responsible for the decline,"" Sheedy said.

We wanted to examine his theory.

Declining popularity of marriage

Reports of marriage’s decline are not greatly exaggerated. Story after story has documented its waning popularity.

According to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census data, 51 percent of American adults were married and 28 percent never had been as of December 2011. In 1960, 72 percent of adults were married and 15 percent never had been. The marriage decline is strongest among young adults.

The trend is not at all isolated to Americans, Pew points out. Other post-industrial societies are seeing the same thing. Stephanie Coontz, feminist scholar and author, explored what’s behind the drop in U.S. marriages in a Los Angeles Times column in 2012:

""Fifty years ago, getting married was a step young people took on the road to becoming economically secure, emotionally responsible and socially respectable. Today, it is more often the reward couples give themselves when they have achieved those goals. The vast majority of new marriages are between couples who have already cohabited. But many cohabiting couples refuse to marry until they are convinced that each partner has demonstrated his or her economic and emotional reliability.""

The European experience

Spain and the Netherlands are countries frequently cited as examples of places where marriages declined when alternative options, in this case gay marriage, were offered.

Scandinavian countries -- Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Sweden -- were first to introduce marriage-like rights for gay couples in the late 1980s and early ‘90s. In a 2004 essay, Stanley Kurtz, of the conservative Hoover Institute at Stanford University, argued these laws hastened the decline of marriage and the family, pointing to corresponding upticks in child wedlock and cohabitation with a declining marriage rate. ""The rise of fragile families based on cohabitation and out-of-wedlock childbearing means that during the ‘90s, the total rate of family dissolution in Scandinavia significantly increased,"" he wrote for The Weekly Standard.

Kurtz has debated this issue in public essays for years with an advocate for gay marriage, M.V. Lee Badgett, research director of the Williams Institute for Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at UCLA.

She has criticized Kurtz’s analyses of marriage in Scandinavian countries, writing that marriage rates, divorce rates, and non-marital birth rates were already changing since the 1970s, in all post-industrial countries, regardless of whether they adopted same-sex partnership laws. In an interview, she said analyses like his don’t account for the number of people who are getting domestic partnerships and otherwise would not have gotten married.

The New York Times documented the popularity of civil solidarity pacts in France, pointing out that 95 percent of the pacts were between heterosexual couples in 2009. (These pacts more closely mirror the legislation Sobel proposed.) The Times reported that there were two civil unions for every three marriages in France,

Brad Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, pointed us to the World Family Map 2013, which shows cohabitation is more common, and marriage in less common, in countries that have civil unions.

""Judging by the European experience, passage of civil unions laws appears to be linked to higher rates of cohabitation and lower rates of marriage,"" Wilcox said. ""But it's possible that a weakening faith in marriage is driving all this, not any particular legislation.""

 What about the U.S.?

We could not find evidence of the trend Sheedy spoke about happening in the United States.

We looked for apples-to-apples comparisons with the 10 states and D.C. that have passed civil unions or domestic partnership registries. In those states -- Oregon, California, Nevada, New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Maine, D.C., Wisconsin -- the marriage rate has fallen, but that is consistent with the national trend. It’s also not different from other declining state-by-state marriage rates from the CDC since 1990. Florida’s own rate is down from 10.9 (marriages per 1,000 people) to 7.4.

Experts we consulted agreed on this point: There is no proven causative effect of the growth of domestic partnerships and declines in marriage.

""No one has done research to look at trends at what happens with domestic partnerships,"" Badgett said.

In an email interview, Coontz said the seeming correlation with the decline of marriage in most cases is due to more heterosexual couples avoiding or delaying marriage as attitudes about marriage alternatives become more accepting.

""As that happens, countries tend to get more accepting of cohabitation and of recognizing same-sex partnerships,"" Coontz said. ""But the one does not cause the other. They both reflect longer-terms trends in gender relations, social tolerance and the institution of marriage.""

Our ruling

In opposing a bill that would allow for domestic partnerships statewide, Sheedy of the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops said, ""In other jurisdictions where this has been enacted, we have seen that fewer people enter into marriage.""

For domestic partnerships, he has offered no support in the United States, and no experts we consulted could find reports that vouch for that effect. In some countries, domestic partnership registries and gay marriage have increased while heterosexual marriage has decreased. But it’s not at all clear that the first trend is causing the second. In other words, correlation does not equal causation.

Marriage is declining in popularity across the world, and has been for decades. No one has shown rates are declining directly because of domestic partnerships.

Barack Obama says sequester would leave ‘tens of thousands’ of parents scrambling for child care
","
Will the sequester yank away parents’ child care?

On March 1, mandatory federal budget cuts take effect that were supposed to be so painful that Congress would take action to avoid them.

President Barack Obama has urged lawmakers to avoid the cuts, known as the sequester, and has been citing dire predictions about who might be hurt by the across-the-board reductions in a broad range of federal programs.

On Feb. 19, 2013, he warned that if Congress didn’t take action, ""tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find child care for their kids.""

The New York Times reported the next day that ""day care centers are almost certainly not going to be padlocked on March 1.""

But what will happen? And will it send parents scrambling?

 Child care subsidies and Head Start

At least two federal programs that affect parents’ child care options face cuts under the sequester.

First, let’s recap how the sequester works. Unless a deal is struck, most types of federal spending must be cut by a uniform amount — tentatively 7.9 percent for most types of defense discretionary funding and 5.3 percent for nondefense discretionary funding. (Certain programs are shielded from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs. Medicare would be cut by 2 percent.)

The uniform cuts must be applied to any ""program, project or activity"" that isn’t otherwise exempted. However, within a given program, officials don’t have to cut every line item equally. They have discretion to move money around within a program.

The two big federal programs affecting child care are the Child Care Development Block Fund, which helps states provide child care subsidies for low-income working parents that affect more than 1.6 million kids. The second is early education program Head Start, which awards grants to public and private agencies to increase kids’ ""school readiness,"" such as with whole or half-day programs in schools and centers. (It also includes programs that wouldn’t offset parents’ child care needs.) Head Start says it serves more than a million kids a year.

All of Head Start’s funding is open to sequester, according to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. About half of the Child Care Development Block Fund’s program’s federal funding is mandatory — and therefore exempt from the sequester — but the other half faces cuts.

Both programs are organized under the Health and Human Services Department, which estimates that ""up to 70,000 children"" would lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start programs, with some centers closing their programs early this year or delaying their start in the fall. Meanwhile, budget cuts would leave ""up to 30,000 children"" without child care services, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote.

House Democrats and the White House also rely on the HHS estimates.

But the precise impact and timing of the cuts is difficult to quantify. Why? Because the programs are designed to give considerable control over spending to states and other public and private agencies.

Head Start’s rolling grant process means cuts will need to be made over the next seven months, the remainder of the current fiscal year, said Ted Froats, a spokesman for HHS’ Administration for Children and Families. But with the child care grant program, while cuts also take place over seven months, it’s harder to say when the impact may be felt. 
The department reached its 30,000 estimate by reducing the amount of funding available for the year according to the rules of the sequester and comparing that with the average cost per child served, Froats said.

But states have ""broad flexibility"" in administering the program, which is also partly funded by the states themselves and by moving money from other federal pots, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.

Parents qualify for subsidies on a sliding scale, with some paying co-pays — and rules vary state by state.

States might respond to federal cuts in a variety of ways, such as:

• Imposing stricter eligibility criteria.

• Freezing new enrollments.

• Reducing subsidy amounts.

• Increasing parental co-payment amounts.

So it’s possible currently enrolled parents may keep their care, but with a lower subsidy or a higher co-pay. 
Still, it’s important to note that states are already stretched. Nearly half had waiting lists or stopped taking new families in 2012, according to a report by the Women's National Law Center, which advocates for affordable child care. Meanwhile, reimbursement amounts have lagged. Parents may not be able to keep up with yet another cut.

And the idea that states might be able to move money around and still support the same number of kids doesn’t hold up, said Karen Schulman, a senior policy analyst who co-authored the report.

""They wouldn't have waiting lists if they had other ways around,"" she said. ""... To me, that suggests they've already looked at the 'fat.'""

(The libertarian Cato Institute in 2010 noted a 2004 report from Congress’ Government Accountability Office found HHS didn't do a sufficient job overseeing state management of the program, leading to waste and abuse. But GAO’s recommendations have since been implemented.)

 Our ruling

The president warned that if Congress didn’t take action, ""tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find child care for their kids.""

The sequester does hit two big programs that affect parents’ child care or their need for it — a subsidy program and the early childhood education program Head Start. The government estimates up to 100,000 kids would be affected. But neither the White House nor HHS has provided sufficient evidence to establish the number of kids whose parents would need to find other child care.

Parents might be able to keep their subsidized child care with lower subsidies or higher co-pays. In the case of Head Start, it’s not clear how many of the affected kids would lose spots in the types of programs that might leave their parents in a child-care lurch. Between the two, ""tens of thousands"" is plausible, but unproven. We rate the claim Half True.
