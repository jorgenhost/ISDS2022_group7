Jon Huntsman says Internet use in China allows forum for discontent
","
Jon Huntsman is fluent in all things China.

The former Utah governor has held a lifelong interest in the Far East. He speaks fluent Mandarin, and as the U.S. ambassador to China, he lived in Beijing for the last two years until he resigned to run for the Republican nomination for president.

Huntsman drew on his experience at a campaign stop in New Hampshire when he spoke about the promise and the potential challenges caused by the growing number of Internet users in the country.

""This is a huge, hugely important transition that China's still in the middle of,"" Huntsman told workers at Cirtronics Corp. in Milford, N.H during a tour on Aug. 2, 2011.

""It's ... happening, this transition, at a time when you've got the rise of 500 million Internet users in China,"" he said. ""I mean, can you get your mind around that? Five hundred million Internet users and 80 million bloggers who are driving discussions in China. ... So you've got a lot of people voicing frustration and discontent.""

If any presidential candidate knows about how often Chinese people use the Internet, it should be Huntsman. But, we wondered if he was right -- particularly whether there are that many bloggers in a country that is not exactly known for free speech.

Asked about the source of the numbers, the Huntsman campaign pointed us to media reports from Reuters and the Epoch Times, which, in turn, led us to a study released last month by the Chinese Internet Network Information Center.

The Information Center, a non-profit organization administered by the Chinese government, hasn’t yet released an English translation of the study, the ""28th Statistical Survey Report on Internet Development in China."" But media reports indicate that the report shows the number of Internet users in China to be fast approaching 500 million.

The study reports that 485 million people now use the Internet in China, making it the largest Internet nation in the world, according to InternetWorldStats.com, a website that tracks Web use across the globe. And that number, which is up 27 million from last year, will likely pass the 500 million mark by the end of 2011.

But the current figure, 485 million, still leaves more than 65 percent of the country’s 1.3 billion people without Internet access, according to the InternetWorldStats.com. By contrast, only 22 percent of households in the United States don't have access.

As far as bloggers go, it looks like Huntsman low-balled his number. While he placed the number of bloggers in China at 80 million, the Network Information Center’s report cites numbers as high as 195 million microbloggers across the country.

Microblogs are defined as shorter blog posts, not unlike Twitter updates. The Chinese government has blocked both Twitter and Facebook. But it permits use of Sina Weibo, a social media site in the same vein, among other microblogging sites.

Huntsman’s figures about the number of bloggers are based on a previous Information Center study, according to the campaign. The report, released in January, said there were 63 million microbloggers. But that number has more than tripled in the months since, reaching 195 million in last month’s report.

The center’s numbers may be slightly exaggerated, as the definition of Internet user is broad, but they are generally regarded as the most accurate figures around, according to David Bandurski, editor of the China Media Project website in Hong Kong.

""Of course, China is often accused of padding its numbers, but the CNNIC numbers are quite reliable,"" Bandurski wrote in an e-mail.

What’s less certain is the number of Internet users voicing ""frustration and discontent,"" as Huntsman said.

Political and activist bloggers often generate attention in China as they fall victim to government censorship. In March, noted Chinese writer Ran Yunfei drew headlines when he was arrested for calling for government protests on his blog. In total, more than 20 activists, including bloggers, have been detained or have gone missing in recent months, according to Amnesty International.

Still, in China, as in the United States, most bloggers focus far more on social topics than politics, according to Heather Inwood, a professor of Chinese media at the Ohio State University. The vast majority of blogs and microblog posts are directed more toward media and games than politics or the government, Inwood said.

""It's important not to over-emphasize the interest in politics on the Chinese Internet,"" she said last week. ""By far and away, what most people are doing online is relaxing, seeking entertainment, communicating with friends, playing video games. … Blogs really reflect that.""

 Our ruling:

Huntsman said there are 500 million Internet users in China and 80 million bloggers, ""so you’ve got a lot of people voicing frustration and discontent.""

He's right about the 500 million and his estimate on bloggers is low, but his underlying point is valid. But it's worth noting that experts say the vast majority of bloggers are writing about social rather than political topics. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B4D1C0>],/factchecks/2011/aug/19/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-internet-use-china-forum-discon/

Jeff Merkley says letting the payroll tax holiday expire will cost jobs
","
With all the intense interest on Congress during the debt ceiling debate and with all the nervous tics from people watching the near-death process, there’s little surprise that Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley’s decision to vote against the final deal drew reaction from his constituents.

The debt agreement passed 74-26, of course, but Merkley was one of only six Democrats voting against a deal that prevented the United States from defaulting on its financial obligations for the first time in history.

In explaining his vote, Merkley offered some general observations about the impact on people, especially the middle class.

""I voted against the deal because, in short, I felt that it would make it harder for middle class Oregonians to get ahead now and in the future,"" he said in an Aug. 3 letter to a constituent in Hillsboro.

""I have a single, simple measure to evaluate this proposal: is it going to create greater opportunities for prosperity and success for working Americans?  Unfortunately, I have concluded that it will not, and so I cannot support it,"" Merkley said.

Pretty general stuff.

But he also offered a specific complaint - that the deal could slow down federal spending at the same time other government efforts to stimulate the economy are also ending, including the payroll tax holiday. Merkley says that’s a recipe for worsening the job picture at the very time when jobs are most needed.

He backs his claim with numbers, which always gets our juices flowing here at PolitiFact Oregon.

Allowing the payroll tax holiday to expire Dec. 31 is a terrible choice, he says in the letter, ""costing another estimated 900,000 jobs in 2012.""

That tax cut lowers Social Security payroll taxes paid by employees to 4.2 percent of earnings from 6.2 percent.

The economic argument Merkley makes is well known: that the extra $1,000 on average a family will have because of the payroll tax holiday will be spent. That means more money in circulation, which means more products produced and sold, which means more demand and more jobs. But is his claim correct about jobs connected to the payroll tax holiday?

For support, Merkley cites an Aug. 1, 2011, analysis by economist John S. Irons at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.

""Extending that tax cut for another year would provide roughly $118 billion in stimulus through increases in employees’ take-home pay, which would boost economic activity by an even greater $128 billion, Irons writes. ""Allowing this policy to expire would lower GDP by 0.8 percent in 2012, and would lead to roughly 972,000 fewer jobs.""

While other economists have come to similar conclusions, absolute truth is impossible to obtain. Many factors affect economic performance -- including such wild-cards as weather and market psychology.

Howard Gleckman, the editor of a tax blog for the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, has this to say about extending the payroll tax holiday:

""Obama wants to extend this year’s payroll tax holiday. That may help keep consumer demand afloat. But since we don’t know what households have been doing with the extra cash they got this year, it is hard to predict what will happen if the holiday is extended.""

The payroll tax is scheduled to go back up Jan. 1, unless Congress renews it.

If it is extended, the payroll tax holiday would mean $400 for the year for workers who make $20,000; $800 for workers who make $40,000; and $2,000 for workers who make $100,000. Social Security taxes only apply to income up to $106,800, so the measure particularly benefits workers below that threshold who, most economists say, are more likely to spend it.

Merkley’s analysis conforms with traditional economic thinking and he is supported by actual calculations from economists. But questions of cause and effect in the economy always must be qualified as simply best educated guesses. Merkley adds the proper fudge in his letter, saying the job loss totals are estimates. In a world where absolutes are rare, Merkley’s statement passes the sniff test. We rate his claim: Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3D83C0>],/factchecks/2011/aug/19/jeff-merkley/jeff-merkley-says-letting-payroll-tax-holiday-expi/
"['National', 'Civil Rights', 'LGBTQ', 'States', 'Martin Frost']","
Did Gov. Rick Perry change position on same sex marriage?
","
In a column in POLITICO Aug. 12, 2011, former Texas congressman and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee head Martin Frost argued that Texas Gov. Rick Perry may not be ready for the increased scrutiny of a presidential campaign.

""Perry demonstrated that he may not be ready for prime time with how he handled the gay marriage issue. First, Perry said that he didn’t have any problem with states like New York approving gay marriage — though he didn’t think it was appropriate for Texas. It was a state's rights issue,"" Frost wrote.

""However, after getting strong pushback from the religious right community, Perry changed his position, saying he was in favor of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage everywhere. ""

We'll explore Frost's claim in two parts. Did Perry say it was a states' rights issue? And did he then shift his stance to support an amendment?

Frost told us he was out of the country for two weeks and wouldn't be able to provide additional information about his claim. We called and e-mailed Perry's campaign and did not receive a response.

State's rights: 'That's New York, and that's their business'

Perry addressed the state's rights question when he spoke to a Republican Governors Association forum at the Aspen Institute in Colorado on July 22, 2011. Here's how the Associated Press reported it:

Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a potential Republican presidential candidate, said Friday he supports state rights so much that he's fine with New York's approval of gay marriage but still called himself an ""unapologetic social conservative.""

Perry, who has been weighing a presidential run, said he opposes gay marriage — but that he's also a firm believer of the 10th Amendment.

""Our friends in New York six weeks ago passed a statute that said marriage can be between two people of the same sex. And you know what? That's New York, and that's their business, and that's fine with me,"" he said to applause from several hundred GOP donors in Aspen, Colo. ""That is their call. If you believe in the 10th Amendment, stay out of their business.""

So Perry was strongly in favor of state's rights. But soon after, social conservatives including former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who is also running for the nomination, attacked Perry for his stance.

""So Gov Perry, if a state wanted to allow polygamy, or if they chose to deny heterosexuals the right to marry, would that be OK too?"" Santorum tweeted after the speech.

Supporting a federal constitutional amendment

Six days later, the Texas governor added this explanation in an appearance with Family Research Council President Tony Perkins:

""I probably needed to add a few words after that 'it's fine with me,' and that it's fine with me that a state is using their sovereign rights to decide an issue. Obviously gay marriage is not fine with me. My stance hasn't changed,"" he said. ""I believe marriage is a union between one man and one woman.""

Perry pointed to his efforts to pass a defense of marriage act in Texas. In 2003, Perry signed a bill specifying that Texas does not legally recognize a same-sex marriage or civil union. Two years later, he supported strengthening the law with the Texas Marriage Amendment, defining marriage as the ""union of one man and one woman."" The amendment was approved by Texas voters in November 2005.

During his conversation with Perkins, Perry also endorsed a federal marriage amendment. He said it is being offered out of concern that ""activist"" judges would impose a different definition of marriage on the states. ""Indeed, to not pass the federal marriage amendment would impinge on Texas and other states not to have marriage forced upon us by these activist judges and special interest groups.""

Was that a shift for Perry? We scoured books and newspaper databases and couldn't find any other comments from him that directly address a federal amendment, although we did find a column from Feb. 19, 2009, in the Austin American-Statesman in which he obliquely addressed it. Speaking of leaders in Washington, he said, ""Can you imagine if they built a constitutional firewall around traditional marriage?"" That comment implied that he supported such an amendment.

Activists on both sides of the issue also told us he was a supporter of such an amendment before his remarks a few weeks ago.

Kelly Shackelford, president of the Liberty Institute, which describes itself as ""guided by principles that limit government and promote Judeo-Christian values,"" said that Perry has ""been in favor of a federal marriage amendment for a long time.""

He said Perry favors the federal constitutional amendment because he is concerned that without it, ""the courts will take it out of our hands."" Shackelford said Perry's position is consistent with his strong support for the 10th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which says, ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.""

Since a proposed amendment must be ratified by three-fourths of the states, it provides an opportunity for the states to speak, according to Shackelford.

Dennis Coleman, executive director of Equality Texas, which opposes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, also said that Perry has supported a federal constitutional amendment on marriage in the past, as well as the state amendment. ""He does believe in states rights,"" said Coleman, but Perry also holds a position that ""it should not be legislated from the bench. It should be decided by the people.""

After the flap in July, Perry spokesman Mark Miner was quoted in the Austin American-Statesman also affirming that Perry supported a federal constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman. ""Nothing has changed with the governor's philosophy here,"" the Statesman quoted him saying.

Still, in Perry's discussions of the issue prior to the dust-up over his remarks at the National Governors Association, he has emphasized states' rights rather than support for a constitutional amendment.

Here's how his position was summed up in an interview in the April 4, 2011, issue of the conservative National Review:

""Here's something you won't hear an up-and-down-the-line conservative like Perry saying all that often: 'If you don't like medical marijuana and gay marriage, don't move to California.' ...Perry is content for Californians to let their freak flags fly, though he confesses that he recoils from some of the implications of his hard-line constitutionalism: The thought of flag-burning, for instance, makes Rick Perry one angry Eagle Scot. But his laissez-faire attitude is surprisingly broad … 'don't make me accept it as normal,' Perry says, 'and do not make me pay for it. But that's classic Tenth Amendment, and I'll fight to the death for California's right to decide for themselves how they want to live.'""

The interview contained no mention of the federal constitutional amendment on marriage, although it did quote Perry saying: ""I have no problem changing the Constitution from time to time: I want a balanced-budget amendment. There’s a process for that, for amending the Constitution.""

Perry's 2010 manifesto, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, strongly endorses states' rights but does not discuss a federal constitutional amendment on gay marriage.

""If you don't support the death penalty and citizens packing a pistol, don't come to Texas. If you don't like medical marijuana and gay marriage, don't move to California …

""I would no more consider living in Massachusetts than I suspect a great number of folks from Massachusetts would like to live in Texas. We just don't agree on a number of things. They passed state-run health care, they have sanctioned gay marriage.""

Perry does mention his concerns about the courts imposing their views of marriage on states:

""Gay marriage will soon be the policy of the United States, irrespective of federalism, the Constitution or the wishes of the American people. Not because it is actually protected in the Constitution, but because judges will declare it so.""

He does not go on, however, to argue that a federal constitutional amendment is needed to head off this result. He makes no mention of it at all in the section of the book called, ""Our Ability to Define Marriage.""

Nor does he mention such an amendment in his final chapter, ""Retaking the Reins of Government: Freedom and Federalism for the Future."" He does, however discuss the need to ""amend the Constitution -- now -- to restrict federal spending."" and the option of repealing the 16th Amendment, which provides for income tax.

Our ruling

Frost claims that Perry has flip-flopped on the issue and didn't bring up the amendment until a conservative outcry about his states' rights remarks.

We find some merit to Frost's claim because Perry did, indeed, bring up his support for the amendment after his remarks about gay marriage in New York stirred up a storm. And we found little evidence that he talked about it much before that. Instead, he emphasized a view that states should decide for themselves.

Still, activists on both sides of the issue as well as his spokesman said Perry supported the amendment long before his recent comments. And he has consistently raised a concern that the courts might force acceptance of same sex marriage on states that disapprove, which is his rationale for supporting a federal constitutional amendment.

Frost is right that Perry changed in the face of criticism, but the change appears not to have been so much a change in policy as a change in rhetorical emphasis designed to quiet critics. Because Frost said Perry ""changed his position,"" we rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4AE340>],/factchecks/2011/aug/19/martin-frost/did-gov-rick-perry-change-position-same-sex-marria/
"['Elections', 'Wisconsin', 'Tammy Baldwin']","
U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin says the Wisconsin state Senate recalls played out on the ""deepest red districts in the state""
","
U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin doesn’t pretend that the recall elections on Aug. 9, 2011, were a big victory for Democrats, who narrowly lost their bid to flip partisan control of the Wisconsin state Senate.

But the day after the elections, the Madison Democrat, who is positioning herself for a Senate bid in 2012, told a news interviewer on ABC News’ Top Line webcast that the deck was stacked against the Democrats in ""deeply red"" districts.

""Think about the districts that these battles were fought in,"" Baldwin said. ""These are Senate districts that were won by Republicans in 2008, which was a Democratic wave election. So we’re talking about the deepest red districts in the state.""

She added: ""If some of these battles had been fought out in slightly less red districts we would have seen a different thing. But this wasn’t a statewide election.""

Baldwin’s observations fit the Democratic opinion that winning two of six seats held by incumbent Republican senators was significant progress. (Recalls also were held July 19, 2011 and Aug. 16, 2011, with three Democratic incumbents retaining their seats and leaving the chamber split 17-16 for the GOP).

But Baldwin went further by saying the recall turf was ""the deepest"" red districts in the state.

Let’s take a look at her take.

Baldwin is correct that all six districts were taken or held by Republican candidates in an abysmal GOP year (2008).

Indeed, the six districts, spread across the state, have long Republican traditions -- a fact pointed out by Baldwin’s office when we asked her to back up the claim.

One of the districts, represented by Sheila Harsdorf in northwestern Wisconsin, went 58 percent for Republican Scott Walker in the fall 2010 governor’s race. Walker won 57 percent in three of the other recall districts, and 54 percent in a fifth.

In the 2008 presidential race, in which Barack Obama swamped Republican John McCain in Wisconsin, the GOP vote in five of the six recall districts was about 5 percentage points higher than the GOP vote statewide. And in those same five districts in the 2010 governor’s race, that advantage was 4 percentage points. (These measures exclude one district that is an outlier; more on that later).

So by some important measures, there’s no doubt these are Republican-oriented districts.

However, Baldwin claimed these were not just Republican districts, but the ""deepest"" red ones.

We found convincing evidence otherwise in the number-crunching by Journal Sentinel Washington Bureau Chief Craig Gilbert, whose blog, The Wisconsin Voter, regularly digs into statistics-based election analysis.

There’s an elite tier of bedrock GOP Senate districts -- but arguably none of the six Baldwin referred to is in that tier, Gilbert’s reporting shows.

The deepest red districts are clustered in the suburban-rural ring around Milwaukee or farther out in southeastern Wisconsin. These take in areas of Ozaukee, Washington, Waukesha, Dodge and Walworth counties -- some of the most reliably conservative and Republican sections of the state.

One way to examine Senate districts is to look at McCain’s performance. He got only 42 percent statewide, but still managed to carry five districts in the Milwaukee area. That suggests those are even deeper red. And none of those McCain hot spots was among those where recalls took place.

In fact, Obama won all of the GOP-recall Senate districts. That would suggest a bit of a blue tint. Or that the districts have swung back and forth over time, depending on the year and the race.

Let’s look at the 2010 race between Walker and the Democratic candidate, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

Five of the recall districts, as we mentioned earlier, went handily for Walker -- giving him 54% to 58% of the vote.

But that’s not the whole story.

Those margins in the recall districts were right around the median victory margin in GOP-held Senate districts in Walker’s comfortable victory.

By contrast, that elite tier of GOP-dominated districts went for Walker by 62 percent to 74 percent, with districts represented by Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) and Glenn Grothman (R-West Bend), respectively, at the two ends of that scale.

Finally, there is the ""outlier"" district we mentioned, the one represented by Republican Dan Kapanke of La Crosse, who fell in the Aug. 9 recall to Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Shilling.

That district has voted less Republican than the state as a whole in two recent election years -- including a 61 percent showing by Barack Obama. And Democrats have broken through to represent that seat a couple times over the last half-century. Kapanke’s district split down the middle in the Walker-Barrett race.

So Baldwin’s statement is even more off as it relates to that district.

We could talk about the numbers until we’re, well, blue in the face.

But we’ll end it here:

Baldwin said on an ABC News political webcast that the battleground for the Aug. 9, 2011 state Senate recalls was the ""deepest"" Republican districts in the state.

There’s an element of truth here, in that four of the GOP recall districts were in the top third of GOP performance in the presidential contest and governor’s race. But upon closer inspection there is an elite tier of districts that seem a much better fit for the title ""deepest red.""  And one of the GOP-held recall seats is really closer to a toss-up district.

We rate her statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C519C0>],/factchecks/2011/aug/19/tammy-baldwin/us-rep-tammy-baldwin-says-wisconsin-state-senate-r/
"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Beverly Hall']","
Former Atlanta schools chief Hall says recent scores ""have not been questioned""
","
Former Atlanta schools chief Beverly Hall is defending her reputation in a national education publication.

Investigators released a report in July that found soaring scores on the Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests that made Hall an education star were the result of widespread cheating. Critics have called her a crook and a liar. Some want her to return more than a half-million dollars in bonuses. Others want her behind bars.

So when the trade publication Education Week ran a commentary by Hall on Aug. 10, PolitiFact Georgia took notice. What could she possibly say to clear her name?

Hall’s piece, ""The Scandal Is Not the Whole Story,"" argued that because the district improved test security in 2010 and 2011, cheating did not taint all of APS’ gains.

""The results of the standardized tests administered in 2010 and 2011 under this enhanced security have not been questioned -- and most important of all -- the dramatic improvement in test scores has remained,"" Hall wrote.

The 2010 and 2011 results ""have not been questioned""? We reached for our Truth-O-Meter.

Before we launch into our analysis, we need to make two points. The first is that this story will not address whether APS tests scores registered ""dramatic improvement."" We’ll leave that question for another time.

More importantly, when Hall got wind of our story, she decided to revise the sentence we are checking. Now it reads ""the results of the standardized tests administered in 2010 and 2011 under this enhanced security indicate that dramatic improvement in test scores has remained."" Since her unrevised statement was online for more than a week, we think it’s still fair game to check it.

Now on to Hall’s statement. We asked Hall’s lawyer for proof, but he did not respond.  Fortunately, we had plenty of other sources.

One was the Governor’s Office of Student Achievement, which launched a statewide analysis of 2009 CRCT tests the same year a probe by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found improbable gains in test scores. At two schools, the odds of making such leaps were less than 1 in a billion.

GOSA Executive Director Kathleen Mathers said Hall is wrong about 2010’s results.

GOSA flagged 16 Atlanta elementary and middle schools for possible cheating on that year’s test. This means that 11 percent or more of their classrooms showed high numbers of wrong-to-right erasures, which is a sign of possible cheating. Thirteen of these schools had already been flagged for their 2009 scores.

Mathers also referred us to the state investigation that found widespread APS corruption. It uncovered even more evidence of testing impropriety or outright cheating on the 2010 CRCT. Here are some examples:   
    *Parks Middle School: A teacher saw evidence that a paraprofessional gave the school’s principal a testing booklet that he was not supposed to have. When she reported the incident, the principal pressured her to change her story.   
    * Dunbar Elementary: One teacher found what he thought to be math formula cheat sheets on every student’s desk during math CRCT testing. He also discovered that students had their social studies books out before the social studies CRCT tests. 
    * D.H. Stanton Elementary: Teachers said they think cheating occurred because the school’s testing coordinator allowed teachers who were friends to administer the test to each other’s students. Some had a reputation for cheating. 
    * Dobbs Elementary: A student told a teacher that the person who administered their CRCT gave them test answers. 
    * Bethune Elementary: A teacher said that the principal allowed students who live out of zone to stay at the school if they had good scores. 
So much for Hall’s claim about the 2010 CRCTs. What about the 2011 tests?

GOSA has not yet performed its statewide erasure analysis on these newest APS scores, and the special investigation did not address 2011.

The AJC did publish its own analysis July 28.

Five schools registered unlikely increases in their CRCT test scores this year. Three of them -- Toomer, White and West Manor elementary schools -- had also been named in the special investigator’s report for 2009 cheating. West Manor and White were also flagged in 2010.

The odds of such increases range from about one in 700 to one in 21,000, according to the AJC analysis -- not as unlikely as gains in prior years, but still statistically unusual.

School supporters say teaching methods or changing enrollment were behind the increases, but APS’ interim Superintendent Errol Davis and Mathers said they may deserve further scrutiny.

Hall’s claim is clearly incorrect. So how do we rule?

Hall submitted her commentary to Education Week on Aug. 9, according to its opinion editor. This is days after the AJC released its findings on the 2011 scores and more than a month after special investigators released their report.  

She had more than enough time to figure out that GOSA, special investigators and the AJC have questioned her results.

Hall’s pants are more than singed. They’re blazing.

She earns our lowest rating on this one. Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FBD340>],/factchecks/2011/aug/19/beverly-hall/former-atlanta-schools-cheif-halls-says-recent-sco/
"['Education', 'Science', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Gov. Rick Perry says Texas public schools teach evolution and creationism
","
Stumping in New Hampshire Aug. 18, Gov. Rick Perry responded to a woman urging her child to ask him about evolution, according to a blog post by ABC News. 
""Here your mom was asking about evolution, and you know it's a theory that's out there, and it's got some gaps in it,"" Perry said. ""In Texas, we teach both creationism and evolution in our public schools — because I figure you're smart enough to figure out which one is right."" 
We wondered whether he’s correct that creationism, the biblical explanation of human origins, and evolution, the scientific theory, are both taught in Texas public schools. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has said that teaching creationism in public schools is unconstitutional because it amounts to the endorsement of religion, according to Kristi Bowman, a Michigan State University law professor and expert in education law. She pointed to a 1987 decision striking down a Louisiana law that said evolution instruction in public schools was not allowed unless it was accompanied by instruction in ""creation science."" 
We looked at the state's current science curriculum standards, which make no mention of creationism while indicating that evolutionary theory should be covered in high school classes. 
The high school biology standards say that in all fields of science, students should analyze, evaluate and critique scientific explanations using empirical evidence, logical reasoning, and experimental and observational testing, including ""examining all sides of scientific evidence of those scientific explanations, so as to encourage critical thinking."" 
According to the standards, biology classes are to present evolutionary theory as a ""scientific explanation for the unity and diversity of life."" Instructional details in the standards touch on fossil records, natural selection, adaptation and genetic mutation, among other topics. 
The Texas State Board of Education adopted those curriculum standards in 2009, and the revision process drew national attention as some conservatives pushed for inclusion of provisions that could cast doubt on evolution. 
The final version was described by some state board members as a compromise between ""those who are critical of teaching evolutionary theories without scrutiny and those who feared attacks on evolution would lead to the teaching of creationism in Texas schools,"" according to a March, 28, 2009, Austin American-Statesman news article. 
The revised standards removed the requirement that students be taught the ""strengths and weaknesses"" of scientific theories. Opponents of the ""strengths and weaknesses"" provision argued that it would eventually open the door to teaching creationism in science classes, according to a March 26, 2009, news story in the Dallas Morning News, while supporters pointed out that the rule had already been in the standards for two decades. 
However, the board added the requirement that ""all sides"" of theories be scrutinized. 
In a March 27, 2009, article, the Houston Chronicle quoted a lawyer for the Seattle-based Discovery Institute, which is an advocate of the idea that the universe is the product of an intelligent designer, as saying that the ""all sides"" requirement ""is the strongest critical thinking standard in any state science standards."" 
The Statesman story reported that the institute called the new standards ""a huge victory for those who favor teaching the scientific evidence for and against evolution."" 
After the approval of the standards, the Texas Freedom Network, which calls itself a mainstream voice to counter the religious right, still saw reason for concern. In a press release, network President Kathy Miller said: ""The word 'weaknesses' no longer appears in the science standards. But the document still has plenty of potential footholds for creationist attacks on evolution to make their way into Texas classrooms."" 
The first test came this July when the Texas board adopted online science materials for public school classrooms to supplement current textbooks. The new materials had to follow the curriculum standards that the board approved in 2009. 
A July 22, 2011, Statesman article reported that none of the high school biology submissions up for consideration by the board included teaching of either creationism or intelligent design. The one offering that did touch on intelligent design failed to make the list of materials recommended to the board by Education Commissioner Robert Scott. Nor did the Republican-controlled board add it. 
However, the approval of the supplemental materials followed a discussion among board members of claims of errors in how evolution was addressed in a submission from publisher Holt McDougal, the Statesman story said. The publisher maintained that the points at issue, identified by a board-appointed reviewer, were not wrong. 
The Statesman story also reported that five other reviewers of the biology materials — four teachers and a professor — said in a letter to the board that the error claims ""seem entirely dedicated to undermining the presentation of evolution. Many of the claims derive from overtly creationist literature and arguments."" 
In the end, board members chose to turn the issue over to Scott, who later determined that Holt McDougal had ""sufficiently addressed all eight of the reported errors,"" according to an Aug. 10 memo to the board from the Texas Education Agency. 
In an Aug. 15 news release, the Texas Freedom Network applauded the final version of the Holt McDougal materials, saying they were ""in line with established mainstream science."" 
Finally, we wondered what teachers are actually teaching in science classrooms. 
Penn State University political scientist Eric Plutzer, who helped conduct a 2007 national survey of more than 950 science teachers in 49 states, including Texas, told us in an interview that in any state 10 percent to 20 percent of science teachers are ""endorsing creationism in their classrooms, often devoting one to four class hours to creationism over the course of the year."" 
A synopsis of the survey, published in the Jan. 27, 2011, issue of Science magazine, says a ""sizable number of teachers expose their students to all positions — scientific or not."" 
Plutzer told us: ""One thing you can be certain of is that large numbers of public school science teachers in Texas are endorsing creationism."" 
In separate interviews, two advocates for science teachers agreed that some Texas teachers could be teaching creationism, but they stressed that the state doesn't require or even authorize that. 
""It is false to say that is how it’s supposed to be done,"" said Josh Rosenau, an analyst for the California-based National Center for Science Education. 
Chuck Hempstead, executive director of the Science Teachers Association of Texas, said the Texas curriculum standards ""require the teaching of evolution. Creationism is not science and is not addressed in Texas public schools."" 
John West, a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, told us that the science standards don't call for the teaching of creationism or intelligent design. He also said the institute's view is that the recently approved science materials don't meet the curriculum standards' requirement that ""all sides"" of evolutionary theory be analyzed, including information that is critical of evolution. 
As we looked into Perry’s statement, his spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said by email: ""It is required that students evaluate and analyze the theory of evolution, and creationism very likely comes up and is discussed in that process. Teachers are also permitted to discuss it with students in that context."" 
The Texas Education Agency sent us a similar statement. 
Our sense: No doubt, some Texas teachers address the subject of creationism. But it’s not state law or policy to intermix instruction on creationism and evolution. We rate Perry’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809759DF80>],/factchecks/2011/aug/19/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-texas-public-schools-teach-evo/
"['National', 'Taxes', 'Warren Buffett']","
Warren Buffett says the super-rich pay lower tax rates than others
","
It's not often you see someone stand up and say, ""Tax me more!"" 
Yet that's just what famed investor Warren Buffett has done in an op-ed in the New York Times headlined, ""Stop Coddling the Super-Rich."" Buffett says that very wealthy people like himself pay lower tax rates than the middle class, thanks to special tax categories for investment income.  
""While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks,"" he writes. 
As an example, Buffett said he paid an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent, while people who worked in his office made much less but paid higher effective tax rates of between 33 percent and 41 percent, averaging 36 percent.

""If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine — most likely by a lot,"" Buffett wrote. ""To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It’s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""

Buffett's op-ed inspired a reader to write to us and ask how Buffett's numbers could be correct. As our previous fact-checks have shown, about half of all Americans pay no federal income taxes because they are low income. And when you analyze who pays the bulk of federal income taxes, it's people with higher incomes. So we decided to fact-check Buffett's statement that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. ... (The middle class) fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot."" 
Before we get to the heart of the fact-check, it's best if we review a few basics of the tax code that Buffett's op-ed takes for granted. This review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated, so bear with us. 

Income taxes. Federal income taxes are progressive, which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money. Let's take a married couple filing jointly as an example. In 2011, after deductions and exemptions: 
• the income between $0 and $17,000 is taxed at 10 percent; 
• the income between $17,000 and $69,000 is taxed at 15 percent; 
• the income between $69,000 and $139,350 is taxed at 25 percent; 
• the income between $139,350 and $212,300 is taxed at 28 percent; 
• the income between $212,300 and $379,150 is taxed at 33 percent; 
• the income above $379,150 is taxed at 35 percent.  
Keep in mind that even if you're in the top bracket of 35 percent, you don't pay that tax rate on all your income. You pay 10 percent on the first $17,000, 15 percent on the money between $17,000 and $69,000, and so on. 
Payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes. If you work for a company, your employer deducts the payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and sends the money on to the federal government. These taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare; it's listed as FICA on your pay stub. Typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for Social Security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage. The employer has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. Last year, though, President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure. So this year, most of us are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent. Oh, and if you're self-employed, you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 10.4 percent on earnings up to $106,800 and 2.9 percent on all income. Payroll taxes are not progressive -- the rates don't get higher the more you earn. In the case of the Social Security taxes, which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings, the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the $106,800 cap.  
Head hurt yet? Ours, too. 
Taxes on investments. Okay, now we're getting closer to Buffett's main point here, and that's taxes on investments. The tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income. If you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership, those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent, the rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. 
Some hedge fund managers and other finance-sector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as ""carried interest"" and taxed as a capital gain. (The Wall Street Journal breaks down how carried interest works.) In fact, some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges, because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains. Defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risk-taking and entrepreneurship. They also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends. We won't settle the argument here, but there's no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers.  
Getting back to Buffett's op-ed, his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other. The fact we're checking here is that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes,"" while middle class taxpayers ""fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot."" 
He's right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job. Very little of this taxpayer's income is wage income, so payroll taxes don't take much of a bite. It seems likely that much of this hypothetical person's income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate. And, in fact, as Buffett says, statistics from the Internal Revenue Service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent. 
On the other side of the equation, people who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. It gets a little complicated, given how the tax brackets work, but basically, people who make between $100,000 and $200,000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes, and it goes up from there, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.  
Buffett slightly glosses over the fact that if you're in the 25 percent tax bracket, your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent. And, the more money you make, the more income taxes you pay, while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income. We're dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate, as Buffett claims someone in his office now pays. (The top income tax rate is 35 percent, but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises, which makes it difficult to get above 37.9 percent, according to the people we ran this by at the Tax Policy Center.) We contacted Buffett's offices as Berkshire Hathaway about this point but didn't hear back.  
One final note: People who don't pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes, or they qualify for enough deductions -- think of child tax credits and mortgage interest -- that they have no income. When Buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does, he's thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries. 
So when it comes to Buffett's statement, there are two categories: the rich and the really rich. And the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income then their merely well-to-do counterparts -- if their income comes primarily from investments. Overall, we rate Buffett's statement True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFFD5C0>],/factchecks/2011/aug/18/warren-buffett/warren-buffett-says-super-rich-pay-lower-taxes-oth/
"['State Budget', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Gov. Rick Scott says deficit turned into surplus
","
The state's finances are in the black -- with more than a $1 billion surplus, according to Florida Gov. Rick Scott.

In an Aug. 10, 2011, interview with the Miami Herald editorial board, Scott summarized the state's financial picture this way:

""When I walked into office we were projecting somewhere between a $3.4-3.7 billion budget deficit. Right now we are projecting for the fiscal year that started July 1 a $1.2 billion surplus, on top of that right now state revenues are up a little bit better than that.""  
He repeated that claim Aug. 17 in an interview with CNBC:

""I started with a $3.7 billion budget deficit. Now we are projecting a $1.2 billion surplus."" 
Scott's using the language of the federal government, but the state budgeting process is different. Scott referred to a budget ""deficit"" -- but the state's Constitution forbids a deficit -- not having enough money to pay its expenses. What Scott was referring to is a ""shortfall"" -- projected revenues falling short of projected expenses. When facing a shortfall, legislators have to come up with a way to erase the gap and balance the books.

We wanted to check both of Scott's figures so we turned to Amy Baker, the state's chief economist. Baker sent us this summary showing how they started planning for the 2011-12 year with a shortfall and ended with what Scott called a surplus. The same information -- plus additional details about Florida's budget -- are included in this August 2011 report from the state's Office of Economic and Demographic Research.

State budgeting process
When the state puts together its long-term financial outlook, it looks at what it would cost to continue existing services taking into account growth factors such as inflation and whether the number of students or prisoners will increase. 
When the state released its initial long-term financial outlook for the current 2011-12 budget year, economists projected a budget shortfall of about $2.5 billion. But as estimated revenues declined and projected expenditures grew, the shortfall rose to $3.6 billion. That's where Scott got his figure about the ""deficit"" -- or more accurately, ""shortfall.""

On top of that, legislative leaders decided to increase the state's reserves -- setting aside $1 billion for its general revenue reserve fund. So legislators crafting the 2011-12 budget had to cut $3.6 billion in order to balance the books and an additional $1 billion to offset an increase in reserves.

Legislators ultimately cut about $4.5 billion in projected, additional spending from the budget -- eliminating thousands of state jobs and slashing money for schools, hospitals and other services. Combined with Scott's vetoes, the state spent about $181.2 million less then it had available in addition to the $1 billion it set aside in reserves. 
That's the $1.2 billion ""surplus"" cited by Scott. (As of July, that figure grew to about $1.3 billion because of increased revenue estimates.)

But do you call it a surplus?
The dollar figure isn't in dispute, but would we call the unspent reserves a ""surplus?""

Scott spokesman Lane Wright argued that it is a surplus and sent us a dictionary definition of a surplus: ""An amount of something left over when requirements have been met; an excess of production or supply over demand,"" he wrote.

We asked Baker to define surplus. ""A surplus means it was available for expenditures,"" she said. The $1.2 billion was available and the Legislature decided not to spend it and set it aside, she said. ""Normal folks in their daily lives might think of 'surplus' as a windfall. It wasn't a windfall -- it was planned, it is still a surplus. The more accurate term would be 'reserve' since they planned to do it. It's really more clear to say 'reserve' but surplus isn't wrong. ... It is only a surplus to the extent that it wasn't appropriated.""

Technically, the state's economists including Baker call the extra money ""planned general revenue reserve after appropriations"" or ""unallocated general revenue,"" not a ""surplus.""

And in fact, having money left over is commonplace. Baker provided us a chart that shows Florida having ""unallocated general revenue"" every year since the 1984-85 budget year. The amount of leftover money has fluctuated from year to year. From 1984-2003, the size of the reserve has generally been less than $400 million. The reserve fund grew to a peak of $1.9 billion in 2006-07, before decreasing.

Wright, the governor's spokesman, sent us a different chart showing the general revenue fund financial statement as of July 27, 2011. That chart doesn't use the word ""surplus"" but it shows an ending balance for the 2011-12 year of about $1.3 billion. The balance was $433 million for the 2010-11 year (Charlie Crist's last as governor) and about $1.5 billion the year before that. 
That means, by Scott's definition, Crist left office with both a $433 million surplus and a $3.6 billion deficit.

How can that be? Because Scott is comparing apples to oranges -- a projected budget shortfall that accounts for growth and inflation, versus an actual budget ""surplus"" that is a result of the state's requirement that legislators pass a balanced budget.

No matter how big a projected shortfall the state has at the beginning of its budgeting process, it will end up with some type of  ""surplus"" as Scott calls it, or  ""reserve"" as Baker calls it. 
""We can't end the year with a deficit,"" she said. ""They cannot pass a budget that's not balanced.""

Kurt Wenner, vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch, said that Scott should have used the word ""shortfall"" rather than deficit but generally agreed with Scott characterizing the money as a surplus. But he also agreed that the two figures are analyzing different things.

Wenner described the shortfall as a soft number while the surplus is an actual number.

Our ruling
Let's go back to Scott's statement. He said, ""When I walked into office we were projecting somewhere between a $3.4-3.7 billion budget deficit. Right now we are projecting for the fiscal year that started July 1 a $1.2 billion surplus.""

Scott's numbers are generally right but his word choice is problematic and the comparison is misleading.

The Legislature had to cut around $3.6 billion from the amount of money it was expected to have to spend in 2011-12. It wasn't a deficit -- which would mean the state didn't have the money to pay its bills -- but rather a projected shortfall. After making those cuts -- and cutting an additional $1 billion so it could beef up its reserves -- the state now has around $1.3 billion more than it needs to pay its bill as part of the 2011-12 budget. 

But having the extra money is actually common practice for the state. 

In fact, after Crist's last budget as governor, the state had an extra $433 million, or as Scott would say, a ""surplus."" 

It also had a projected $3.6 billion shortfall.

See the problem in making the comparison?

In reality, the state ends most every year with what Scott calls a surplus because the state is required to pass a balanced budget and generally can't borrow money to pay its bills. And in recent years, because state revenue has been declining, the state enters the next year with a projected ""deficit"" using Scott's word -- or more accurately a shortfall.

The fact is that while Scott has his numbers right, he's comparing apples to oranges to paint his fiscal policies in the best light. 

We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CD2A00>],/factchecks/2011/aug/18/rick-scott/gov-scott-says-deficit-turned-surplus/
"['Jobs', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Virginia', 'Democratic Party of Virginia']","
Virginia Democratic Party claims Bob McDonnell has made no progress on jobs
","
The Virginia Democratic Party has not let up on its criticism of Gov. Bob McDonnell’s jobs record.

Their latest salvo is a web video attacking McDonnell’s performance.

""Despite the governor’s slick photo-ops and self congratulatory press releases, the reality is we have made no progress on jobs since he took office,"" the Virginia Democratic Party said in an August 5 statement about the video.

So the commonwealth’s jobs picture hasn’t brightened at all since McDonnell took over? We wanted to see if that was true.

To back up that assertion, Democrats pointed to a statement from the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a Richmond think tank that said Virginia had made ""no real progress"" on job creation since the end of the recession in June 2009.

The think tank examines economic issues facing low and moderate income residents.

The group’s president, Michael Cassidy, noted in a July 22 statement that Virginia had more than 3.6 million jobs back in June 2009 and had about the same amount in June 2011.

But McDonnell didn’t take over as governor until the middle of January 2010. His first full month in office was February 2010 -- at which time the number of jobs was a bit lower.

In February 2010, there were 3,595,600 jobs in the state, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In June 2011, the latest month for which figures were available, that had risen to 3,643,800.

That means that since McDonnell has been governor, the state’s job rolls have increased by 48,200.

The June 2011 employment numbers showed a drop of roughly 14,000 jobs from the previous month’s job figures, a fall-off that Cassidy noted had erased 23 percent of the jobs gained since February 2010.

But even with that decline, there were still nearly 50,000 jobs gained overall since McDonnell took over.

Democrats have used overall job counts to argue the employment situation has at least gotten somewhat better under President Barack Obama. In an August 5, 2011 news release, the Democratic National Committee noted that 2.4 million private sector jobs have been created over the past 17 months. The news release noted that the ""pace of recovery isn’t fast enough, but 2.4 million families are now better able to make ends meet.""

Nationwide figures from the BLS show that from February 2010 to July 2011, private sector jobs rose 2.2 percent ending at 109.2 million. The total number of all jobs in the U.S. -- including government positions -- rose 1.5 percent during the same period ending at 131.2 million.

Brian Coy, a spokesman for the Virginia Democratic Party, also pointed out that the percentage of the state’s working age population with a job is at the same point it was in February 2010.

In February 2010, there were 3,891,279 people in Virginia who were employed, which was 64.3 percent of the state’s working age population of 6,049,306, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In June 2011, the number of people in Virginia with a job had grown to 3,951,327, but the size of the working age population also rose to 6,141,503. That meant the state still had the same 64.3 percent of its working age population employed.

""If you define progress as putting a greater percentage of our population to work (which seems like a fair definition to me), we haven’t made progress since Bob McDonnell took office,"" Coy said in an e-mail.

Terry Rephann, a regional economist with the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, said the percentage of people with jobs can stay constant even if there’s job creation in a state. A state like Virginia, for example, is a fairly typical southern state where the population is growing faster than in the northern states, he said.

As a result, the number of people with jobs has to increase even faster to keep up with that relatively higher rate of population growth, Rephann said.

Rephann said that the jobs environment in Virginia has improved a bit since the early part of last year.

But Rephann also said that the number of jobs created since McDonnell took office isn’t very impressive.

""Even 40,000 in a (state) economy of this size is not really enormous job growth,"" Rephann said. ""But that’s the nature of the economic recovery that we’re in.""

Virginia’s unemployment rate was at a peak of 7.2 percent at the start of McDonnell’s term. The number has consistently declined, and it was 6 percent in June 2011.

The commonwealth’s jobless rate is one third lower than the 9.1 percent national unemployment rate. Virginia is tied with Hawaii and Iowa for the eighth lowest statewide unemployment rate in the country.

Virginia’s percentage of working age residents with a job also compares favorably on a national stage. Nationwide, 58.2 percent of the country’s working age population was employed as of June 2011.

We’ll also point out, as we often do with these stories, that economists repeatedly tell us governors take too much credit and receive too much blame for short-term performance over their state economies.

A governor’s ability to affect brief business cycles is limited, economists say.

To sum up:

The state Democratic party said there has been ""no progress"" on creating jobs since McDonnell took office.

While the Dems are correct that the percentage of the state’s working age population with a job was the same in June 2011 as it was when McDonnell took office, there is no getting around the fact that the state added 48,200 jobs. Or that the unemployment rate has dropped during his term.

That it contradicts the Democrats’ blanket assertion that there has been no progress. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FB1640>],/factchecks/2011/aug/18/democratic-party-virginia/virginia-democratic-party-claims-bob-mcdonnell-has/

Wisconsin Democratic Party says unemployment increasing in Wisconsin at twice the national rate, under GOP Gov. Scott Walker
","
After employment figures for June 2011 were announced, the Wisconsin Republican Party, among others, declared that over half of the job growth in America occurred in Wisconsin.

We graded that statement False, given that the GOP’s math made an apples-to-oranges comparison.

Ten days after the Republican Party made its claim, the Wisconsin Democratic Party focused on the other half of the jobs equation: unemployment.

The Democrats asserted in an Aug. 1, 2011, news release that ""the jobs-killing policies of Scott Walker and his GOP allies in the Senate have put Wisconsin on the top of the heap in unemployment growth. Contrary to Walker's flailing claims about creating jobs, he and his Republican Legislature have actually deepened the pain for Wisconsin's job seekers.""

Then, citing an opinion column posted the previous day in the Capital Times newspaper of Madison, the party claimed that under Walker, ""unemployment is increasing in Wisconsin at twice the rate it is nationally.""

That line caught our attention.

We rated the Republicans wrong on their claim; let’s see about the Democrats.

We called and emailed state Democratic Party spokesman Graeme Zielinski over two days to see if there was other evidence the party wanted us to consider. He did not respond.

The column cited in the Democrats’ news release was written by John Nichols, who is associate editor of the Capital Times and Washington correspondent for The Nation magazine. Both publications have long been known for having a liberal editorial stance.

Nichols wrote that unemployment in June 2011 rose by one-tenth of 1 percent nationally and two-tenths of 1 percent in Wisconsin. ""That’s twice the rate of increase at the national level,"" he said.

Besides the state Democratic Party, Democratic Underground, the pro-labor group Solidarity Wisconsin and RecallScottWalker.com also cited Nichols’ column.

We checked the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report that compared May 2011 and June 2011 unemployment rates and found that Nichols was correct: the U.S. rate rose 0.1 percentage point to 9.2 percent and the Wisconsin rate rose by twice that amount, 0.2 percentage points, to 7.4 percent.

But the state party’s claim was that under Walker, ""unemployment is increasing in Wisconsin at twice the rate it is nationally."" That sets not a one-month measuring stick, but a much longer one.

Here’s a look at the U.S. and Wisconsin monthly unemployment rates from January, when Walker took office, through June of 2011.

January: U.S. -- 9.0 percent ; Wisconsin -- 7.4 percent

February: U.S. -- 8.9 percent ; Wisconsin -- 7.4 percent

March: U.S. -- 8.8 percent; Wisconsin -- 7.4 percent

April: U.S. -- 9.0 percent ; Wisconsin -- 7.3 percent

May: U.S. -- 9.1 percent ; Wisconsin -- 7.4 percent

June: U.S. -- 9.2 percent; Wisconsin -- 7.6 percent

(The July 2011 figures are scheduled to be released Aug. 19, 2011.)

So, the Wisconsin unemployment rate remained unchanged -- at 7.4 percent -- for the first three months of the Walker administration, then it dropped one-tenth of a point in April 2011.

The next month, Wisconsin’s rate returned to 7.4 percent, rising by 0.1 percentage point -- the same rate of increase that occurred nationally.

In June 2011, as we’ve already established, Wisconsin’s rate rose 0.2 percentage points and the U.S. rate rose 0.1 percentage point.

That means Wisconsin’s unemployment rate increased during two of the first six months of the Walker administration, and it rose more than the U.S. rate only one of those times, in June 2011.

The figures also show that both the Wisconsin and U.S. unemployment rates were both 0.2 percentage points higher in June 2011 than in January 2011.

We asked Jon Peacock, research director of the liberal Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, about the monthly unemployment numbers under Walker. He was aware of the small state and national unemployment rate increases in June 2011.

""Taking a really short-term look at things is problematic, especially when you’re looking at unemployment rates -- but also when you’re looking at jobs (growth),"" Peacock said.

In other words, a one-month change in jobs numbers -- good or bad -- does not a trend make.  

So, let’s rate the statement.

The state Democratic Party said that under Walker, ""unemployment is increasing in Wisconsin at twice the rate it is nationally,"" suggesting a strong upward trend had been established.

The state’s unemployment rate did rise by 0.2 percentage points in June 2011, which was double the 0.1 percentage point increase in the U.S. unemployment rate. But this was far from a consistent trend or even a sharp increase. In the first six months of Walker’s administration, the Wisconsin unemployment rate rose more than the U.S. rate only in one month. Moreover, the overall percentage point increase in the state and U.S. rates when compared to January were the same.

The Democrats’ claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972E9F80>],/factchecks/2011/aug/18/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-unemployment-incre/

Sen. Rob Portman says U.S. debt now matches size of gross domestic product

In commenting on his appointment that day, Portman issued a statement with a budget fact that struck us as curious. He said, ""I am honored to answer the call to serve on the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction and will work hard to ensure that meaningful spending cuts are made to reduce our deficits, change the trajectory of Washington's record high debt, and to encourage economic growth and job creation. With the U.S. debt now equal to 100 percent of the GDP, Washington cannot continue to kick the can down the road again.""

Had the federal debt really matched the gross domestic product?

The GDP measures all the goods and services produced here. Add it all up and you know the size of the nation’s economy. News stories have reported over the last year that if the government didn’t make spending cuts or come up with more tax revenue, if not both, the debt load would match and exceed GDP eventually.

Have we already reached that debt-GDP match point? No.

Portman press secretary Christine Mangi said the source of the senator’s claim was a wire service report by Agence France-Presse, or AFP, whose stories are published in newspapers and on the Web. On Aug. 3, using figures for new borrowing as soon as Congress and President Barack Obama lifted the nation’s debt ceiling, AFP reported: ""U.S. gross debt shot up $238 billion to reach 100 percent of gross domestic product after the government's debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury figures showed."" This new borrowing, the wire report said, ""took total public debt to $14.58 trillion, over end-2010 GDP of $14.53 trillion, putting the United States in a league with highly indebted countries like Italy and Belgium.""

We checked those figures. The GDP number used by the wire service was solid -- but out of date. The figure came from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA, whose estimates put the economy’s size last year at $14.5265 trillion.

Here’s the problem: That was GDP for 2010. It has grown since then. GDP was $15.0038 trillion in the second quarter of this year, the most recent measurement available, according to the BEA.

Comparing GDP with debt, we ran the numbers a couple of other ways, using both old and newer BEA figures for GDP and the Treasury Department’s ""Debt to the Penny"" website for specific debt figures. If you wanted to use 2010 GDP, a fairer comparison would be to measure gross debt on Dec. 31, 2010, which was equal to 96.5 percent of the GDP. That’s high, of course, and it prompted concerns about spending and revenues. But it  was not seen as a  doomsday trigger.

So what was the ratio of debt to GDP when Portman made his comment?

The closest calculation possible, using confirmed government figures, is made by comparing GDP for the second quarter of 2011 ($15.0038 trillion) with gross debt ( $14.5819 trillion) on Aug. 10, the day of Portman’s statement. That puts the gross debt at 97.2 percent of GDP. Since Portman relied on the AFP story of a week earlier, we compared the debt on that day, too, and got the same result: Gross debt was 97.2 percent of GDP.

Is this too much quibbling over less than 3 percentage points?

If this were baseball, the statistical equivalent would be to celebrate Barry Bonds making the 3,000-hit club when he hit still had 85 hits to go; in the end, he never made the record. (All other parallels between big numbers and disgrace are strictly incidental.) But in finance, the distance is not as great.

The International Monetary Fund said last year that total debt could match the size of the GDP by 2012, according to Bloomberg, the financial wire service. House Speaker John Boehner made the same prediction, and PolitiFact called it accurate. If anything, the likelihood of the gross debt hitting 100 percent of GDP this calendar year (but in the 2012 fiscal year, which starts in October) has since grown. That’s because the debt is still rising at what is likely to be a faster pace than economic growth, which is torpid.   

""I imagine it will happen sometime in early FY2012,"" Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told us.

So Portman was off but ""pretty darn close, given the information we have,"" Peuquet said.

Still, there’s a caveat: This gross debt that he spoke about is not the scary part to many economists. More important, they say, is the portion of debt that’s owed to the public. This is the pool of Treasury securities that the government sells to investors, and it was $9.916 trillion the day Portman made his statement.

Measured against the size of the economy, that comes to 66 percent of GDP. It’s the highest level since shortly after World War II, when the nation was paying off war debts. In a worst-case scenario, with continuation of current tax rates and no change in spending policies, the public debt could exceed GDP by 2021, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in June.

That’s the doomsday scenario. But the CBO’s more likely scenario would put the public debt at 70 percent in 2020.

The rest of the debt -- $4.67 trillion -- is intra-governmental lending, including Social Security surpluses that the government uses for other federal operations. The money will have to be paid back, but the demand is less pressing right now and it doesn’t affect credit markets. That’s why the public debt, not the gross debt, is what’s most important for understanding the government’s fiscal health, says Gary Therkildsen, a fiscal policy analyst at OMB Watch, a nonprofit government-accountability group.

The CBO was matter-of-fact about it in a report last December: ""Gross debt is not a good indicator of the government’s fiscal condition.""

With that bit of background, we return to Portman.

PolitiFact has discussed the debt’s components before, and economists have said that it’s important to distinguish between the two kinds of debt. But they also say it is not inaccurate -- depending on the context -- to put the two together in order to discuss the gross debt, and that’s what Portman did. Given his stated interest in dealing with long-term budget matters including entitlements, it’s not unreasonable for him to talk about the gross debt.

Where does that leave us?

Portman said the ""U.S. debt is now equal to 100 percent of the GDP.""  It is not, but ""he’s pretty darn close, given the information we have,"" says Peuquet.

Before we rate Portman’s claim, we’ll note that Mangi, Portman’s press secretary, offered still another way of calculating the debt-to-GDP ratio. Although we quibble with this methodology because it still uses outdated numbers, this took the percentage to 98.5 percent, very close to the 97.2 percent figure we got.  Mangi then offered an additional argument to push the percentage past 100: Add in all the debt held by state and local governments, too, ""because the United States government includes federal, state and local governments,"" she said. Put all that debt together and it already exceeds 100 percent of GDP.

Problem is, local and state debt are not part of the broad, divisive debate that led to creation of the new super committee. Portman’s committee is dealing with federal deficits and debt, not the debt of Parma.

And when Portman said ""the U.S. debt now equals 100 percent of the GDP,"" it was clear -- as it has been from weeks of debate in Washington -- which debt he meant.

The gross debt hasn’t reached 100 percent, but it will.

Portman’s statement is not 100 percent accurate, but at 97 percent-plus, it’s close enough to merit a rating of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A6F100>],/factchecks/2011/aug/18/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-us-debt-now-matches-size-gros/

Sen. Sandra Cunningham claims New Jersey residents will turn to crime after losing monthly general assistance payments
","
During a July 11 debate about overriding a veto handed down by Gov. Chris Christie, state Sen. Sandra Cunningham made an impassioned speech about the consequences of eliminating monthly general assistance payments to New Jersey residents in need.

The Hudson County Democrat was pushing to restore the $19.5 million that Christie cut from the state budget for the general assistance program. A part of the state’s welfare reform program, the general assistance program serves single persons and married couples without children.

Cunningham, one of the sponsors of a resolution for that funding, strongly implied that the state budget for fiscal year 2012 cut the $140 monthly payments and that her resolution would restore that amount. She argued that taking away that money would lead individuals to turn to crime.

The problem is that those monthly payments were no longer in jeopardy.

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Cunningham was wrong to suggest the monthly payments were going down. In fact, the final state budget maintains general assistance payments at their previous levels.

First, let’s look at how Cunningham made her case.

""I know when you look at it, you say, ‘It’s $140 per month. What good does it do?’ A hundred-forty dollars per month, if you don’t have a job, if you are trying to keep a roof over your head and food in your stomach, is a great deal of money,"" Cunningham told her colleagues. ""It’s absolutely necessary.

""If we don’t help these people, these people will find a way to help themselves,"" Cunningham continued. ""When we talk about urban area, and when we talk about impoverished people, we talk a lot about crime. Well, crime and poverty go together.""

Cunningham went on, ""And in this particular case, if these people cannot find, cannot have something to eat, they will take to the streets and they will commit a crime. They will do that.""

Before concluding her speech, Cunningham pleaded with her fellow senators: ""Please think about how some of our people really need it and how some of our people in this state are forced to live. Please vote for this resolution.""

The resolution to provide that funding failed in a 24-15 vote.

Now, let’s explain the general assistance payments.

In fiscal year 2011, the general assistance program provided monthly benefits of $140 and $210 for recipients deemed ""employable"" and ""unemployable,"" respectively.

The fiscal year 2012 budget proposed by Gov. Chris Christie included language to cut monthly benefits by $15. But the Legislature threw out that language when it approved the budget and Christie could not add it back in.

David Rosen, legislative budget and finance officer for the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, confirmed that removing that language from the governor’s proposed budget maintained the monthly benefit levels and the governor could not restore that language.

Nicole Brossoie, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services, said in an email that the monthly benefits will remain unchanged in fiscal year 2012 because that language was eliminated.

State funding for the general assistance program remains slightly below the fiscal year 2011 level, but that’s due to other program changes, Brossoie said. Of Cunningham’s resolution, Brossoie said, ""No change would have been made to cash benefits.""

So, let’s be clear: Cunningham urged her colleagues to maintain $140 monthly payments that were not being cut.

Cunningham told PolitiFact New Jersey that at the time she made the statement she believed the Senate resolution would restore the $15 cut to monthly payments. She later acknowledged that the monthly benefits have been restored to their prior levels, but declined to comment further.

But what about Cunningham’s claim that losing general assistance payments could drive some recipients to commit crimes?

Two experts said general assistance payments won’t necessarily prevent crime.

""There is certainly a link between poverty and crime, but it’s not so simple that a small payment would fix it,"" said John Roman, executive director of the District of Columbia Crime Policy Institute.

The ruling

Cunningham strongly implied the state budget cut monthly general assistance payments, but the budget actually kept those payments intact. The senator also said losing that money could lead to more crime, but two experts said the payments wouldn’t necessarily prevent criminal acts.

Cunningham acknowledged the monthly benefits were restored, but it is still ridiculous for her to claim people will commit crime in response to losing general assistance payments, when those payments aren’t changing at all.

We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

Consultant says 37 percent of Central Falls’ retired police officers and firefighters are on disability pensions, compared with 5 percent nationally
","
On July 19, during a public meeting at Central Falls High School’s auditorium, state-appointed receiver Robert Flanders Jr. told about 100 of the city’s retired firefighters and police officers that they’d have to give up half their annual pension benefits or the city would face bankruptcy.

The retirees ultimately rejected the request and, on Aug. 1, the city became the first in Rhode Island history to file for bankruptcy. Records in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court show that  the city, as of Aug. 1, owed $3.6 million to its retirees, who are paid out of the pension fund. That’s equivalent to nearly two-thirds of the city’s projected  $5.6-million deficit.

During that July 19 meeting, Flanders’ team of financial advisers ran down the pension numbers.

Seated on stage with Flanders and a handful of other advisers was Stephen Lisauskas, a consultant at the Collins Center for Public Management at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. The administration of then-Gov. Donald Carcieri hired Lisauskas as a consultant to help sort through Central Falls’ fiscal mess, paying the Collins Center $75,000 in fiscal 2010.

At the meeting, Lisauskas talked about the high cost of the Central Falls pension plans -- the city, with an annual budget of about $17 million, faces $80 million in unfunded pension and benefit obligations.

According to a story about the meeting that appeared in the July 20 Providence Journal, Lisauskas said that in Central Falls, 37 percent of retired firefighters and police officers are out on disability pensions, compared with a national average of about 5 percent.

If that’s true, it would mean Central Falls firefighters and police are retiring on disability at more than seven times the national average.

Disability pensions typically offer more generous benefits and cost municipalities more.
They also allow employees who otherwise wouldn’t qualify for their maximum retirement benefits to retire early with full benefits, meaning they’re on the pension rolls longer.

In Central Falls, for example, retired firefighters on disability pensions can collect 66.6 percent of their former salaries tax free regardless of their years of service. A firefighter who retires on an ordinary pension would need work for 30 to 35 years to collect the maximum 65-percent benefit.

We wondered whether Central Falls police officers and firefighters had a disability rate that’s so out-of-whack with the rest of the country.

First, we asked Lisauskas where he got his numbers.

""We looked at the number of pensions provided on a disability basis and the city arrived at the figure that 37 percent [of retired police and firefighters] are out on disability pensions,"" he said. ""And our pension consultants have informed us that the national average for police and fire is roughly 5 percent.""

The Central Falls numbers were easy enough to check; the state had provided The Journal with a list of all retired Central Falls police officers and firefighters receiving pensions.

Of the 143 pensions on the list, 52 are labeled disability pensions, which amounts to 36.4 percent, very close to the 37 percent that Lisauskas cited.

However, the list indicates 15 of the 52 disability pensions have been converted to ordinary pensions because of the age of the retirees. So, to be accurate, it’s currently 26 percent.

Now, on the bigger question: How does Central Falls stack up with the rest of the country?

First, we tried the Pew Center on the States, which collects information about public employee pensions. The center had no data on disability rates.

Then we called the National Association of Retirement Administrators, which also said it was unaware of any data on disability pension rates.

Surely, we thought, the International Association of Fire Fighters in Washington, D.C., would know.  

""I’m not sure there’s a database anywhere that can answer that question,"" Lori Moore-Merrell, assistant to the association’s general president, said, ""because the pension systems are so different and they differ from state to state.""

So we did some spot checks.

The Rhode Island Municipal Employees Retirement System (MERS), a collection of plans run by the state, covers some police and firefighters in Cranston, Woonsocket and several smaller communities.

Of the 547 recipients of police and firefighter pensions in MERS, 113 -- about 21 percent -- receive disability pensions, according to Dara Chadwick, spokeswoman for the state retirement system. That’s less than the share of disabled retirees in Central Falls -- but  nowhere near what Lisauskas said is a 5-percent national average.

Then, we checked outside our area code.

Not all state or municipal pension systems track disability rates for retired police officers and firefighters, but we found a few that did. (Some figures are from this year, others are from 2010.) 
In New York state, the share of retired police officers and firefighters receiving disability pensions is 19.25 percent. (The plan does not include New York City.)

In Ohio, it’s just under 35 percent.

In Indiana, it’s 24 percent.

In California, the state pension system lumps police and firefighters with correctional officers and school safety personnel, so it wasn’t comparable. But we learned that San Jose, Calif., had analyzed its pension costs for police and firefighters, so we checked there.

Robin Opheim, senior performance auditor in the San Jose’s auditor’s office, said  67 percent of the city’s retired firefighters and 41 percent of retired police officers were receiving disability pensions as of February 2010.

Rhode Island, New York, Ohio, Indiana and San Jose all have double-digit disability rates for retired firefighters and police officers.  So where did Lisauskas come up with a 5-percent national average?

We called him back to find out. The 5-percent average, he told us, came from actuaries he’d spoken to at Buck Consultants, based in New York City. (As it happens, Buck Consultants is the actuary for the City of Providence.)

So we called Buck’s headquarters.

""I’m not aware of any formal study that Buck’s done in that area,"" Buck spokesman Ed Gadowski said. ""... I’m not sure where he got it from.""

One of Buck’s actuaries, Daniel W. Sherman, attended the same July 19 meeting in Central Falls where Lisauskas stated that the national average was 5 percent. So we called Sherman to see whether he knew the source of the data.

""There’s no study,"" Sherman said. ""I was just asked the question off-the-cuff: What do you think the percentage ought to be?""

Sherman said he was giving Lisauskas a benchmark for the share of disability pensions in a city with a well-managed plan.

""What I told Steve [Lisauskas] was 5 to 10 percent and I was thinking of all people -- all participants in the plan."" By ""all,"" he says, he meant all municipal employees including office workers, who one would expect to have a lower disability rate.

In summary, Lisauskas said 37 percent of Central Falls police and firefighters are on disability pensions.

That accurately describes the share of police and firefighters who retired on disability pensions, but only 26 percent are currently receiving disability pensions.

More importantly, he went on to compare Central Falls with a national average that, we found, doesn’t really exist.

In a crucial discussion about Central Falls’ finances, we’d expect better from a consultant hired for his expert advice.

We rate the claim False.

"['Congress', 'Illinois', 'Jan. 6', 'Rodney Davis']","
No, Pelosi was not calling all the shots for Capitol security officials on Jan. 6
","As the Democrat-led investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol devolves even further into an exercise of political finger pointing, U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis of Illinois has joined a chorus of Republicans trying to shift blame for security failures to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Davis — originally picked to serve on the House panel before House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his appointees in protest — appeared with a group of House Republicans at a press conference just hours before the July 27 hearings began. Davis, who has been named a potential contender for governor in Illinois, called out what he alleged were structural problems preventing Capitol police from making critical decisions during the crisis. ""The chief of police cannot make a final security decision without going to political appointees that make up the Capitol Police Board — his or her bosses,"" Davis said. Specifically, he pointed to the fact that then-House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving requested Pelosi’s permission to seek support from the National Guard that afternoon: ""If Sergeant-at-Arms Irving felt he needed the speaker’s approval then, what were the instructions and conversations he had with the speaker’s office prior to Jan. 6?"" Davis said. ""Former Capitol Police Chief Steve Sund has testified that Irving was concerned as many have said about the ‘optics,’ and we know that the speaker’s office was calling the shots on all of their actions on Jan. 6."" Earlier this morning, I joined @GOPLeader, @SteveScalise, @RepStefanik, and other @HouseGOP colleagues to talk about the security posture of the Capitol Complex on 1/6 and how the security structure of the U.S. Capitol is set up to fail.  You can watch my full remarks below: pic.twitter.com/kimh4mQNoS PolitiFact and other fact checkers have debunked numerous claims contending Pelosi alone was responsible for Capitol security. Davis’ claim pointed to the speaker’s role in directing Capitol security leaders, rather than all of Capitol security. But it’s still highly misleading. The House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, who are nominated by each chamber’s leader and elected by chamber members, serve as the Capitol’s chief law enforcement officers for their respective chambers. Each makes decisions for the Capitol Police Board, which oversees the Capitol’s police force in concert with several House and Senate committees, including one on which Davis sits. The House sergeant-at-arms reports to the House speaker just as the Senate sergeant-at-arms reports to the Senate majority leader, but there is no indication Pelosi controls day-to-day security operations. So we reached out to Davis’ office to ask what he was talking about. Citing a Feb. 1 letter from Sund to Pelosi, Davis spokesman Aaron DeGroot responded in an email that the former police chief ""alone could not request National Guard support because he ‘had no authority to do so without an Emergency Declaration by the Capitol Police Board.’ Requesting National Guard support is a major security decision, and it’s one that even the Speaker’s office admits they were involved in."" That description is accurate. According to a bipartisan Senate report on the Jan. 6 attack, the Capitol police chief ""has no unilateral authority to request assistance from the National Guard"" and ""must submit a request for assistance to the Capitol Police Board for approval."" Likewise, as DeGroot noted, Pelosi’s office has said Irving did request the speaker’s permission to call on the National Guard. However, those facts do not prove Pelosi made all the calls on how Sund, Irving, and the other members of the Capitol Police Board responded to the crisis — most notably because then-Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger, who reported to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the time, also played an active role. As Sund noted in his letter to Pelosi, the police chief ""notified the two Sergeant at Arms"" around 1 p.m. on Jan. 6 that he ""urgently needed support."" Despite confusion over the statutory process for requesting National Guard assistance, both Irving and Stenger eventually approved Sund’s request to call for backup at 2:10 p.m., according to the Senate report. Prior to that approval being granted, the New York Times reported, aides to both congressional leaders ""were perplexed to learn that the two sergeants-at-arms had not yet approved the request for troops, according to spokesmen for Mr. McConnell and Ms. Pelosi."" ""The speaker expects security professionals to make security decisions and to be informed of those decisions,"" Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill told the Times. Davis said ""we know that the speaker’s office was calling the shots on all of"" the actions taken by the officials in charge of Capitol security on Jan. 6. As evidence, his office highlighted the fact that then-House Sergeant-at-Arms Irving requested approval from Pelosi before greenlighting the Capitol police chief’s request to call in the National Guard. But Davis and his spokesman ignored a critical detail: the decision to approve that request and call for backup was not Irving’s call alone. It was made in conjunction with the Senate sergeant-at-arms, who reports to the Senate majority leader. At the time, that was McConnell. We rate Davis’ claim Mostly False.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We could not find any evidence — published or broadcast interviews, or CDC news releases  — to support the claim that Walenksy said vaccines are failing. And she did not say vaccinated people carry ""higher"" viral loads than unvaccinated people. She said vaccinated and unvaccinated people have ""similarly high"" viral loads. The CDC released updated guidance on July 27 for vaccinated people, recommending they wear masks indoors in geographic areas that have ""substantial and high transmission"" of COVID-19. On that date, 46% of U.S. counties had high transmission and 17% had substantial transmission, CNN reported.  Walensky said the changes were needed because the agency had new scientific data showing that the delta variant behaves differently from past strains of the virus. The agency did not immediately release the data being referenced, though. A few days later, news organizations published a leaked internal report from the CDC that suggested that vaccinated people who have breakthrough infections from the delta variant might be able to transmit COVID-19 as easily as the unvaccinated, and also have viral loads similar to the unvaccinated who are infected with the variant.  Viral load is ""a measure of the density of viral particles in the body,"" according to the journal Nature. Walensky said higher viral loads ""suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with delta can transmit the virus.""  The finding was based in part on a cluster infection on Cape Cod in Massachusetts that so far has been associated with 900 COVID-19 cases, most of which are from the delta variant. About three-quarters of those infected had been vaccinated. Though the total number of cases was high, serious cases were rare: there were seven hospitalizations and zero deaths.  The internal CDC document noted that breakthrough cases continue to be rare and a small percentage of cases. NBC News collected data from 38 states and found 125,682 breakthrough cases, representing less than .08 percent of those who have been fully vaccinated, or one in 1,300. Kaiser Family Foundation also analyzed breakthrough cases from 25 states that report data on them and found that in more than 9 in 10 COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths have been among the unvaccinated or not yet fully vaccinated.  An Instagram post said, ""CDC confesses: Vaccines are failing, and the vaxxed can be superspreaders."" The post said this was ""via the words of the CDC’s own director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.""

Safer to be unvaccinated against COVID-19? In several ways, that’s False
","A viral image shared on Facebook suggests that, when it comes to COVID-19, it’s safer to be unvaccinated than vaccinated. The image makes its claim using a grid with checkmarks. It says that both the unvaccinated and the vaccinated can get, spread and die from COVID-19, but that only the vaccinated can die from the vaccine. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Sure, people who are vaccinated can get the virus, spread it and, in exceedingly rare cases, die from it. No vaccine is 100% effective. But getting vaccinated dramatically reduces the likelihood of a COVID-19 infection. And for those who do get COVID-19, being vaccinated makes it less likely that you’ll get seriously ill.  No proof has been established that any of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. have caused deaths. Common side effects of the vaccination include temporary pain at the injection site, fatigue and fever. As for more serious potential side effects, the Centers for Disease Control has been monitoring reports of adverse events following vaccination, including allergic reactions, blood clots, heart inflammation and a nerve condition called Guillain-Barré Syndrome, and has found them to be rare or temporary and treatable. The CDC maintains that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks. Here’s a look at some numbers to understand how the risks of being vaccinated compare with the risk of not being vaccinated. Vaccine effectiveness: Studies of the general adult population in the United States show that the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines have an 86% to 89% effectiveness rate against infection, and a 96% effectiveness rate against hospitalization, according to the CDC. Early evidence for the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine also demonstrates effectiveness against COVID-19, but more studies are underway, CDC said. Vaccine safety: More than 342 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through July 26, 2021, according to the CDC. During that period, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System run by the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — which receives unverified reports of potential vaccine side effects — received 6,340 reports of death (0.0019%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. But VAERS reports alone do not indicate whether a vaccine causes a particular adverse effect. ""A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines,"" the CDC said. Deaths among unvaccinated people: On July 16, even as the delta variant of the virus began spreading, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky  said that over 97% of new hospitalizations were in patients who are unvaccinated. Breakthrough cases: The CDC’s latest data on breakthrough cases — people who become infected with COVID-19 after being vaccinated — says that as of July 26, of the more than 163 million people who had been fully vaccinated, 6,587 were hospitalized or died in the 49 states and territories that report their data to the CDC. Of the 1,263 deaths, 309 were reported as asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19.  The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation drilled down to infection rates, finding that among 25 states that report breakthrough cases publicly, the infection rate is well below 1%, ranging from 0.01% in Connecticut to 0.29% in Alaska. The CDC has found evidence suggesting that, although it’s rare for vaccinated people to become infected, those who do can spread the virus as readily as unvaccinated people who get infected.  We rate the claim that it’s safer to be unvaccinated than vaccinated against COVID-19 as False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C161DC0>],/factchecks/2021/aug/04/viral-image/covid-19-its-safer-be-unvaccinated-several-ways-s-/

Claim that ivermectin is bringing down COVID-19 mortality rate in Mexico lacks evidence
","A graphic on social media claiming to illustrate the effects of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin and its role in decreasing COVID-19 deaths in Mexico lacks verifiable evidence. The graphic in the post is a modified version of a chart that appears on a Mexican government website tracking excess mortality. The modified graphic includes superimposed text and shading to suggest that the decline in excess deaths coincided with and resulted from the introduction of ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no evidence that supports the claim in the Facebook graphic. We emailed a Mexican federal health agency for information related to the Facebook claim but did not hear back. Our research found that the Mexican federal government remains divided on the issue and has not established a unified stance on using ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19. Despite non-binding guidance from the country's health ministry advising that more research and data is necessary, Mexico's Institute of Social Security, a public health agency, allows the drug to be used in some cases.  COVID-19 has killed at least 4 million people worldwide, including almost 242,000 in Mexico, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The number of COVID-19 deaths in Mexico is widely believed to be an undercount.  Excess mortality, as defined by the World Health Organization, is the difference between the observed numbers of deaths and the expected number of deaths for a specific time period. In Mexico, excess deaths began tapering off in late winter and early spring with the first arrival of vaccines for medical workers in late December 2020. Vaccine access remains a barrier in the country and locally produced vaccines weren’t a reality until May. The graphic circulating on Facebook was authored by Juan J. Chamie, a self-described analyst associated with an advocacy group that pushes for the use of ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment. In an email to PolitiFact, Chamie pointed to data from the Mexican government showing that the excess mortality rate dropped exponentially from week to week from February through July. The most recent excess mortality rate data — for the week beginning July 5 — shows that fatalities were about 7% less than projected. When looking at the excess mortality data compiled by the Mexican federal government, this year’s rate is calculated by comparing to pre-pandemic average mortality rates from 2015 to 2019, accounting for year-to-year variations. But we found no data or evidence showing a causal relationship between that decline and ivermectin specifically.  ""The evidence on the use of ivermectin to reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations is based on a retrospective study using COVID-19 registry data sponsored by the Mexico City Health Ministry,"" said Dr. Omar Yaxmehen Bello-Chavolla, an associate professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico’s medical school in Mexico City.  ""No experimental studies have been conducted to support this claim,"" Bello-Chavolla said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""A causal link between ivermectin and any related COVID-19 outcome cannot be ascertained with the available evidence."" In May, Mexico City health officials released results from a non-clinical study — a study that did not directly involve humans — that claimed ivermectin helped reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations by 76%. Results of the study were not published in any scientific or medical journals, and it did not directly address Mexico’s excess mortality rates. The city government in December 2020 started distributing 83,000 medical kits to people at home (not hospitalized) with mild-to-moderate cases, according to the study. The kits contained three different drugs, including ivermectin. But ivermectin was the only drug trumpeted in the study released by Mexico City. The study was widely characterized as misleading, according to the Brazilian fact-checking site Estadão Verifica, since it heavily emphasized ivermectin. Mexico’s Institute of Social Security has defended the use of the drug to treat COVID-19 and pointed to the Mexico City non-clinical study as proof of the drug’s treatment potential.  However, there is still no firm consensus among Mexican federal government officials on the use of ivermectin against COVID-19. Ministry of Health Undersecretary Hugo López Gatell said more data was needed to paint a clearer picture of ivermectin’s efficacy (or lack thereof) as a COVID-19 treatment, the Mexico City-based news organization Animal Político reported in March. PolitiFact has fact-checked several claims concerning ivermectin and its efficacy against COVID-19. We’ve found that some studies suggest the drug can help treat COVID-19, while other studies show no tangible effect. Many of the studies had small sample sizes and other methodological limitations.  Pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co., which developed ivermectin and makes the drug, said in February that based on available and emerging studies of the drug to treat COVID-19, company scientists found ""no scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect."" The company also said it found ""a concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.""  A March statement from the World Health Organization also said that data from known trials using ivermectin were inconclusive and that more information was needed. It also recommended against the use of the drug for treating COVID-19 except in clinical settings. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has not approved ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. A social media post claims that the use of ivermectin to treat individuals with COVID-19 caused a substantial decrease of excess mortality rates in Mexico.  We found no credible published data showing a causal relationship between ivermectin and decreased COVID-19 mortality in Mexico. A maker of ivermectin has also said it does not believe that available data support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19. In the absence of evidence proving the claim, we rate this post False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3D8EC0>],/factchecks/2021/aug/04/facebook-posts/claim-ivermectin-bringing-down-covid-19-mortality-/

Rick Scott’s false claim that Biden, Democrats have done nothing to help families pay their bills
","Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott has been hammering President Joe Biden and the Democrats on inflation. Even as a COVID-19 outbreak ravages his state, Scott said he thinks inflation is the biggest issue Floridians are dealing with. Many investment analysts believe that the current high inflation will be short-lived, but there is no denying that it is up. In June, the Consumer Price Index rose 5.4% from a year earlier, the fastest pace since August 2008. Scott isn’t just blaming Democrats for inflation. He accuses them of ignoring the issue. ""Biden and the Democrats say they care about Americans, but they have done absolutely nothing to help families struggling to keep up with inflation,"" Scott said in a July 30 press release. ""We are nearly $30 trillion in debt, but Democrats have no plans to slow down their spending."" Democrats do plan to spend a lot more money, both through the bipartisan infrastructure bill — roughly $1 trillion — and a budget reconciliation package that could top $3 trillion. Some of that might be paid for through higher taxes on corporations and high income earners. That wouldn’t be inflationary. But broadly, economic theory suggests that heavy government spending could trigger long-term inflation if the economy is not able to absorb it fast enough. But here we focus on Scott’s statement that Democrats have left families totally exposed to higher inflation without doing anything to help. That ignores a lot, particularly the tens of billions of dollars Biden and the Democrats have distributed to millions of American households through the American Rescue Plan Act — which passed in March without a single Republican vote in the Senate or House. According to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based neutral source of tax policy estimates, the American Rescue Plan Act will raise after-tax incomes, on average, by 3.8%. Low- and moderate-income households do best under the law, getting about 70% of all the benefits. We reached out to Scott’s office and did not hear back. Here’s a closer look at what Scott’s statement overlooks. The pandemic relief package offered $1,400 to nearly every person who filed a tax return. Couples making up to $150,000 would get $2,800. The benefit tailed off quickly for incomes above the $150,000 mark. The average payment per household is $2,300, and the money is tax-free.  The lowest fifth of all taxpayers, or those making less than about $26,000, saw the biggest relative increase in their incomes from the relief checks, 14.6%. In raw dollars, people in the second-highest income group — those making between about $80,000 and $130,000 — got the biggest payments, an average of $2,930.  The middle income group, with incomes of roughly $50,000 to $80,000, receive an average of $2,630, and the group second from the bottom, incomes in about the $26,000 to $50,000 range, receive an average of $2,420. The law increased the size of the Child Tax Credit. Most families get a minimum credit of $3,000 for each child under 18. For any child younger than 6, the amount rises to $3,600. The average family with children gains $4,380. Except for the top fifth of income earners, the size of the benefit varies little across the income groups. Taking all households together — those with kids and those without — the average gain is $1,330. The Earned Income Tax Credit dates back to 1975, and it’s aimed at helping low-income working families with children. Whatever they earn, the government gives them just a little bit more on top. The American Rescue Plan Act greatly expanded the credit in terms of dollars and eligibility. The law nearly tripled the maximum amount of the tax credit from $543 to $1,502 for workers with children who don’t meet every legal condition as being part of the household (non-custodial, non-biological children). It raised the income threshold at which the credit begins to phase out — from $8,880 to $11,610 if single, and from $14,820 to $17,550 if married. It expanded the age range, opening it up to workers 19 to 24, and to those over 65. As a result, workers in the lowest two quintiles — roughly, those making less than $50,000 — stand to gain about $850 on average. Across all taxpayers — including the high earners who aren’t eligible — the average benefit is $470. Scott said Biden and the Democrats had ""done absolutely nothing to help families struggling to keep up with inflation."" A credible estimate from the Tax Policy Center finds that the American Rescue Plan Act will raise the average after-tax income by 3.8%, with low- and moderate-income households gaining the most.  We don’t know how the prices of basics like food, gas and clothing will change over the coming months, or how the current influx of government spending will affect inflation rates. But the law backed by Biden and the Democrats will give Americans more money to help cover their bills. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B2F180>],/factchecks/2021/aug/04/rick-scott/rick-scotts-false-claim-biden-democrats-have-done-/

Fauci did not say there was a COVID-19 variant that can evade detection
","With the United States in the midst of a COVID-19 surge driven by the delta variant, a post on Facebook claims that the nation’s top infectious disease expert said that a coronavirus variant can evade detection. The Aug. 1 post looks like a screenshot of a tweet from a now suspended Twitter account and makes a reference to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""Fauci just told us they found a variant that ‘evades the test,’"" the post said. ""He wants you to know that you may be sick with an illness that has NO symptoms and cannot be verified with a test to confirm you have it, which is why you still need to wear a mask."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Based on the March 22 date in the screenshot, it appears the tweet was referring to reports from France and Finland about COVID-19 variants that were hard to detect. But we found no evidence that Fauci has said variants can’t be detected. We asked the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases about this claim and the agency said it was unaware of any such statements made by Fauci. There are three main types of COVID-19 tests. A PCR test is a type of diagnostic test to detect an active infection. The test checks for any viral genetic material present in the sample, taken from a person's nose or mouth. Another type of COVID-19 test is an antigen test, which is similar to the PCR test in that it helps determine if a person is actively infected with COVID-19. While the PCR tests search for material carried inside the virus, the antigen test looks for viral proteins from the surface of the virus. The antigen tests are commonly called rapid tests, because they typically give results within 15 minutes. Results from PCR tests can take longer, usually 24 to 72 hours. A separate type of test is an antibody test, which examines a person's blood to determine whether a person has previously been infected. The NIAID said variants could potentially change how a test performs. Testing targets a specific location on the virus’s genome in order to recognize it as a coronavirus, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. If a mutation changes the genome targeted in the test, it could make it harder to detect. In France, the variant was undetectable by one form of testing, whereas the mutation in Finland was only harder to identify.  For the variant in France, a PCR test using a shallow nasal swab could not identify the virus. However, a PCR test that took a sample from deeper in the nasal cavity identified the virus. A blood test was also able to identify the variant, according to the French health ministry. The Finnish variant was able to be identified through a conventional PCR test. However, researchers said the variant looks closer to a non-mutated coronavirus and could only be identified through a deeper genetic sequencing test. The mutations are not currently circulating as variants of interest or concern by world health officials, and have not been given Greek letter designations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We searched interview transcripts, media appearances and White House press briefings and found no evidence of Fauci ever talking about these specific variants or about any other strain of COVID-19 being able to avoid detection.  In a March 7 interview with Face the Nation, Fauci spoke about a variant found in New York that was shown to have some resistance against antibody treatments and vaccinations. But he did not say the variant could avoid detection.  A Facebook post claims, ""Fauci just told us they found a (coronavirus) variant that ‘evades the test.’"" We searched interview transcripts, media appearances and White House press briefings and found no evidence of Fauci saying anything about any variants that could avoid detection.

No, Evers didn’t say Wisconsin was 'permanently closed'
","Thanks to the COVID-19 vaccines, we’ve been gifted a much more normal Wisconsin summer.  Festivals and farmer’s markets are back in full swing. Restaurants are busy again, even if more of us want to dine on the patio. And in July, 100,000-plus fans were able to gather downtown to celebrate the Milwaukee Bucks’ historic clinch of the NBA finals.  Middling vaccine rates, coupled with the rise of the delta variant, mean the pandemic isn’t behind us just yet. But at the least, we’re in a better place than this time last year.  State Republicans, however, are still sparring with Democratic Gov. Tony Evers over whether Wisconsin businesses are being allowed to flourish.  Rebecca Kleefisch — who served as lieutenant governor under former Gov. Scott Walker and is all but certain to run against Evers in 2022 — used an image of a Google listing to take a shot at Evers on Twitter.  ""Republicans: Wisconsin is open for business!"" she quipped on July 20, 2021. ""Tony Evers: ‘Permanently closed.’""  The tweet included a screenshot of the Google search results for Evers’ office in Madison, with a red bar stating that the entity is ""permanently closed.""  But Evers’ office is clearly not ""permanently closed,"" nor did he ever say that the state was closed permanently.  Let’s break down what happened.  When asked about the tweet and the screenshot, Alec Zimmerman, director of communications for Kleefisch’s conservative advocacy group 1848 Project, sent a screen-recorded video that he said was taken on his phone around July 20, 2021.  In the video, a person types ""governor tony evers office madison phone number"" into the search box. That brings up the results with the ""permanently closed"" label. (It’s worth noting that a Google search of the same words at the time this fact-check was written did not bring up that designation.)  Zimmerman also said it was not surprising that Google had listed Evers’ office as permanently closed because he had removed the ""Open for Business"" tagline on Wisconsin welcome signs that had been put up under Walker’s tenure, and because he ""forced closures of small businesses.""  It’s unlikely that Google flagged Evers’ office as permanently closed because of these reasons — the removal of the signs, for example, happened years ago.   The Capitol, which was indeed closed to the public from the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 through April of this year, has reopened. So Evers’ physical office isn’t closed, either.  What’s more, Evers never said the state was permanently closed, as Kleefisch’s tweet claims.  
  Outside of partisan arguments, Wisconsin’s economy appears to be stabilizing.  A July 2021 report from the University of Wisconsin’s Center for Research on the Wisconsin Economy found that initial unemployment claims have fallen to their lowest levels since the pandemic began, and that Wisconsin had the 10th-lowest unemployment rate in the nation.  The University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh’s Center for Customized Research, which had been surveying the state’s businesses since the pandemic began, found in its June 2021 report that 78% of businesses surveyed thought they could remain viable for at least seven months. More than half thought they could be viable for more than 10 months.  That is up substantially from May 2020, when just under 38% thought they could remain open for at least seven months.  Hundreds of millions in American Rescue Plan Act funds are also headed to Wisconsin small businesses, Evers announced in April. The Wisconsin Tomorrow Small Business Recovery Grant program distributed $5,000 grants to some 84,000 small businesses throughout the state.  In a tweet, Kleefisch declared Evers had said Wisconsin is ""permanently closed"" to business. Setting aside the partisan debate over whether the governor is doing enough to boost business in the Badger State, the image is being mischaracterized as best. Evers’ physical office is not permanently closed, nor is the Capitol itself.  And even if it was closed, that label would be attributed to Google, not Evers.  We rate this claim False.   ",[<zip object at 0x00000280979FFE40>],/factchecks/2021/aug/04/rebecca-kleefisch/no-evers-didnt-say-wisconsin-was-permanently-close/

No, exercise and healthy eating are not 'the best way' to avoid getting COVID-19
","More than 16 months after the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic, and after more than 600,000 COVID-19 deaths in the United States, a widely shared social media post declares that preventing the disease is actually quite simple. ""The best way to avoid COVID altogether is to exercise, eat healthy and let your immune system beat it naturally,"" claims the Instagram post, which calls getting a vaccination instead ""lazy.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s not clear what the post means by ""let your immune system beat it naturally,"" but there is evidence that good nutrition and exercise can reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 illness. Nevertheless, diet and exercise alone are not enough to prevent contracting the virus — nor are they ""the best way"" to avoid it, according to experts.  Public health authorities and researchers say getting vaccinated, along with steps such as masking and social distancing, are the most effective measures one can take to avoid getting the disease. ""Relying on pull-ups and jogging and sit-ups, and avoiding heavy-fat meals and eating a balanced diet, is very good for your general health but we do need additional assistance to ward off germs that can make us very, very sick, and COVID is one of them,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.  ""Healthy living is a good thing, but it is not sufficient,"" he said. ""Your immune system has to be trained specifically to fight off the COVID virus. That’s what the vaccines do."" Schaffner also said that over 95% of people now hospitalized in the United States for COVID-19 are unvaccinated young adults and adolescents, and children.  Dr. Mark Schleiss, professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota Medical School, said that among people ""eating a typical Western diet, which would not have deficiencies in protein and vitamins, ""exercise and healthy eating, although essential for good health in general, don't specifically ameliorate risk of COVID. An individual's risk of getting COVID is related to crowded spaces, particularly poorly ventilated indoor spaces; refusal to vaccinate; and refusal to wear masks."" Vaccines are important because they trigger an immune response that protects against COVID-19, Schleiss added.  University researchers in California, in a study published in April, reviewed 48,440 patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis from January to October 2020. They found that ""consistently meeting physical activity guidelines was strongly associated with a reduced risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes."" But reducing the risk of severe illness is not the same as ""avoiding COVID altogether."" An Instagram post said ""The best way to avoid COVID altogether is to exercise, eat healthy and let your immune system beat it naturally."" Exercise and healthy eating can maintain the body’s immune system and reduce the risk of severe illness from COVID-19. But diet and exercise alone don’t stop people from contracting COVID-19. The best ways to avoid getting the virus is to get vaccinated, wear masks and maintain social distance.

Fact-checking claim criticizing Nikki Fried’s suspension of Jan. 6 defendants’ gun permits
","Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried suspended gun permits for nearly two dozen people charged with crimes related to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. ""The deeply disturbing events that occurred at our nation’s Capitol on January 6 were sedition, treason, and domestic terrorism — and those individuals involved in the insurrection must be held accountable for attempting to subvert our democratic process,"" Fried said in a July 27 statement.  Fried runs the state department that oversees gun permits, including concealed carry licenses. Fried, Florida’s only statewide Democrat officeholder, is running in the 2022 Democratic primary for governor. A conservative Florida attorney criticized the gun permit suspensions on Facebook. ""She suspended ‘gun rights’ — no due process — just because she says these people were merely ‘involved’ in January 6,"" wrote KrisAnne Hall, a Florida attorney who hosts a podcast and gives lectures on the Constitution. ""Did they have a trial? Were they convicted of a crime?"" Fried did use the word ""involved"" in a press release describing the permit holders actions on Jan. 6. But it’s wrong to suggest that Fried suspended their permits just because they were ""involved."" State law calls for suspending gun permits when people are charged with serious offenses. The post is also wrong to claim that due process rights have been ignored. These Floridians will have an opportunity to request a hearing about the suspension. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Florida is a ""shall issue"" state, which makes it easier to get a gun permit than in some other states. There are 2.3 million concealed weapon permit holders. Criminal activity can cost someone their license, at least temporarily. State law requires the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to suspend a concealed carry gun permit when a person is arrested or charged with a crime that would disqualify a person from having a license. This includes any felony offense as well as certain misdemeanors, such as multiple DUIs or drug crimes. For the most recent year ending in June 2021, the state revoked 1,050 licenses and suspended about 7,300. Under Florida law, a concealed weapon or firearm license is a private record — which means we don’t know which Jan. 6 defendants had their permits suspended, and so we also don’t know their specific charges. A spokesperson for the department would not reveal which charges were at play, saying it received the information about the defendants from the U.S. Department of Justice. Suspensions are a temporary action — an interim step to a potential revocation. And state law spells out the mandate for suspensions. It says when the department is notified by a law enforcement agency or a court, it shall suspend a license of a person arrested or charged with a crime that would disqualify the person from having a license until final disposition of the case. Also, the department shall suspend a license of a person who is issued an injunction that restrains the person from committing acts of domestic violence or repeat violence. The Justice Department has charged more than 550 people in connection with the Capitol siege, according to a database run by the George Washington University Center on Extremism. Charges include obstruction of law enforcement, violence with a deadly weapon, assault, and unlawful possession of a firearm on Capitol grounds. The largest number of defendants — 63 — came from Florida, according to the university’s database. Some of the Floridians include: Kevin Tuck, a Windermere police officer who has since resigned. He was indicted on multiple offenses including obstruction of an official proceeding and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building. Adam Johnson, who was photographed carrying Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s lectern during the riot. He was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. Joseph Biggs, a member of the neofascist group the Proud Boys. He was charged with multiple counts including destruction of government property and violent and disorderly conduct. Paul Hodgkins of Tampa, who was seen in the Senate chamber taking selfies, and was the first defendant to be sentenced for a felony charge. Relating to due process, Florida law says that the agriculture department must send a notice of suspension to the permit holder, who then has a few weeks to request a hearing. So far, one suspended permit holder has requested a hearing, said Erin Moffet, a spokesperson for Fried.  If permit holders want to present evidence that they were not charged with a disqualifying offense, they could do so. The number of suspended licenses could go up or down depending on the outcome of cases. As of Aug. 2, the number of suspended permits was 23. In an email interview about her Facebook post, Hall cited part of the law that points to felonies or drug crimes as disqualifying offenses for gun permits. ""The majority of these people have not been charged with crimes that would disqualify them from having a license, therefore they are not eligible for suspension or revocation without actual conviction of a greater crime,"" Hall said in an email. ""Therefore, neither the law nor due process have been served."" We asked Hall how she knows that the majority of these people have not been charged with disqualifying offenses since the names of the permit holders are private and did not get a reply to that question. She is wrong to suggest there is no due process since the permit holders have a right to a hearing.  Daniel W. Webster, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Prevention and Policy, said there isn’t a lot of data to examine offending rates of concealed carry permit holders compared with the public at large.  ""But I think it is still safe to say that, as a group, permit holders are very law-abiding,"" Webster said. ""What people fail to appreciate is that this is simply a reflection of group average. Within that large group, there are clearly subgroups of individuals with much higher risks for violent offending. Participating in a violent insurrection may well be a marker for risks for committing acts of violence.""  A Facebook post said that Fried ""suspended gun rights — no due process — just because she says these people were merely ‘involved’ in January 6.""  The post wrongly suggests that Fried suspended gun permits based on the participants’ mere involvement in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The post ignores what Florida law actually says: Fried’s department is required to suspend gun permits for disqualifying offenses, which includes violent crimes. Since the names of permit holders are a private record in Florida, we can’t independently evaluate their charges to confirm that they are disqualifying offenses under state law. However, under state law, they have a right to request a hearing to challenge their suspensions. We rate this statement Mostly False.

Nancy Pelosi’s dubious claim about who can extend the eviction moratorium
","EDITOR’S NOTE, Aug. 4, 2021: A few hours after we published this fact-check, the CDC announced it was issuing a ""new order temporarily halting evictions in counties with heightened levels"" of coronavirus transmission. This does not change the rating of this fact-check, because the CDC order was new rather than an extension, and because the legality of the new order remains uncertain. In the meantime, this follow-up article addresses the challenges awaiting the new CDC approach. The White House and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went public this week with their differences over an expiring moratorium on evictions, an urgent issue for millions of Americans. The moratorium, which was implemented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in September 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic and extended three times, expired on July 31. At that point, President Joe Biden called on Congress to approve an extension, but facing near-certain rejection in the Senate, Pelosi and her top Democratic lieutenants said it was the executive branch’s job to take unilateral action. In an Aug. 1 tweet, Pelosi wrote: ""The CDC has the power to extend the eviction moratorium. As they double down on masks, why wouldn't they extend the moratorium in light of (the) delta variant?"" The CDC has the power to extend the eviction moratorium. As they double down on masks, why wouldn't they extend the moratorium in light of delta variant? But Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a Republican, called foul in a reply to Pelosi’s tweet. Yost said, ""The Supreme Court ruled that the CDC did not have authority to issue the eviction moratorium — but that Congress does."" Constitutional law experts told us the issue is a little muddier than either politician would have it. However, they agreed that Pelosi overstated her case, because a majority of Supreme Court justices recently said the opposite. RELATED STORY: What’s happening with the federal eviction moratorium and rental assistance? Lawsuits in several states challenged the moratorium as an overreach of federal power. One case, from the Alabama Realtors Association, made it to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Technically, the Supreme Court ruled on a motion to overturn a lower court’s stay order — a procedural ruling that did not officially address the merits of the case. However, the statement issued by the court was fairly transparent about where a majority of justices stood. Five justices — the three more liberal justices, plus Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh — supported keeping the moratorium in place. However, Kavanaugh emphasized in his appended statement that he agreed to continuing the moratorium only because it was about to end.  As a matter of law, Kavanaugh wrote, he thought extending the moratorium further was unconstitutional. ""In my view, clear and specific congressional authorization (via new legislation) would be necessary for the CDC to extend the moratorium past July 31,"" Kavanaugh wrote. On one hand, Kavanaugh’s explanatory statement is something less than binding law, legal experts told PolitiFact.  Kavanaugh’s statement came in a procedural ruling, so the court’s action ""carries less weight than a ruling on the merits after full briefing, oral argument, and a written opinion on the merits,"" said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. Also, Kavanaugh’s opinion was a concurrence by one justice, rather than a statement signed by a clear majority, Tobias said. On the other hand, Kavanaugh’s statement seemed to align him on the merits of the case with the four more conservative justices, and his statement offered a clear roadmap to the court’s thinking. ""The court very likely signaled how it would rule on the question of whether the CDC has the authority to extend the eviction moratorium,"" said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School. ""Most federal agencies would be reluctant to ignore, or proceed in the face of such an indication."" Pelosi’s office said she doesn’t believe the court’s reasoning closes the door on executive authority to extend the moratorium. As evidence, her office pointed to an Aug. 2 statement by White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki that said, ""Our team is redoubling efforts to identify all available legal authorities to provide necessary protections."" ""They are still trying to find legal avenues,"" said Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff.  ""The speaker believes they exist."" However, Psaki’s statement seemed to acknowledge what Pelosi didn’t. ""Unfortunately, the Supreme Court declared on June 29th that the CDC could not grant such an extension without ‘clear and specific congressional authorization (via new legislation),’"" Psaki said. ""To date, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky and her team have been unable to find legal authority for a new, targeted eviction moratorium."" Legal experts aren’t convinced that a legal argument can be found to turn around a majority of justices. ""It is possible that some clever executive branch lawyer will come up with an argument that has not been raised before, but it is unlikely that there will be an argument that’s persuasive to the court,"" said Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case-Western Reserve University. Tobias agreed. ""The speaker’s statement seems like an overstatement,"" he said. Pelosi said, ""The CDC has the power to extend the eviction moratorium."" Pelosi makes it sound as if the legal authority is a certainty, but even the most generous reading of the law’s status today is that it’s inconclusive. And legal experts told PolitiFact that it’s more like a long shot. The lack of a formal Supreme Court ruling on the merits leaves some uncertainty over the law. But at least five justices in a procedural ruling sent a clear signal that they don’t believe the executive branch has that power. Pelosi’s degree of certitude about the law ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Trump's farm bill, food stamps, and North Carolina's GOP Senate candidates
","A Republican U.S. Senate candidate in North Carolina is questioning a primary opponent’s commitment to local farmers and to policies championed by former President Donald Trump. Former U.S. Rep. Mark Walker took exception when U.S. Rep. Ted Budd tweeted on July 16 that he supports North Carolina’s agriculture industry. Walker tweeted:  ""False. In 2018, while I worked with Ron DeSantis and Pres Trump to pass a Farm Bill that helped farmers, invest in rural broadband, and added work requirements for able-bodied adults, Budd voted NO."" (DeSantis was a Florida congressman then.) Walker, Budd and former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory are three of the biggest names among the six candidates on the Republican side. McCrory, piggy-backing on Walker’s tweet, also took the opportunity to bash Budd. Their tweets aim to erode Republican voters’ trust in Budd, who Trump endorsed. In this fact check, we’ll explore the following questions: Is Walker right about their voting records on the farm bill? Did Walker accurately describe the farm bill’s contents? What does Budd say about the vote, and is his explanation accurate? It turns out, Walker is right about Budd opposing the farm bill. The bill did also expand the government’s rural broadband loan program. But Walker’s suggestion that it ""added work requirements for able-bodied adults"" is misleading. One major reason the bill became law: the Senate scrapped the House’s proposed changes to the welfare eligibility requirements. The federal farm bill is usually renewed every five years. And in 2018, Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House. However, they struggled to pass legislation as their members disagreed over policies affecting agriculture, food stamps and even immigration. Budd and Walker were in Congress in 2018 and at times voted with different wings of their party on the legislation, which was revised several times. In a May 18 vote on an early version of the farm bill, officially known as the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Budd voted no and Walker voted yes.  While Walker voted with House leadership in support of the bill, Budd opposed it along with members of the conservative Freedom Caucus. The caucus withheld its support because leadership didn’t commit to a vote on their preferred immigration bill. In a June 21 vote, both voted yes on a version that aimed to reform the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known for providing food stamps. The bill sought to tighten eligibility criteria and impose stricter work requirements on up to 7 million food stamp recipients, Politico reported.  In a Dec. 12 vote, the House approved a bill that strayed from their June 21 version and adopted more of the Senate’s preferences. Walker supported the compromise bill and Budd voted no. On Dec. 20, Trump signed this version of the bill. Walker said the bill ""helped farmers, invest(ed) in rural broadband, and added work requirements for able-bodied adults."" It’s fair to say the first two claims in that sentence are true. However, the part about work requirements is misleading. The bill that Walker voted on (and Trump signed) famously left out major SNAP benefit changes that the House passed and Trump initially called for.  A report by the Congressional Research Service said the bill made only a ""few eligibility changes. Specifically, the bill ""reduced state waivers for work requirements, meaning states could exempt only 12% of their SNAP recipients from work requirements, as opposed to the 15% in the 2014 Farm Bill,"" according to a blog on the Harvard University’s Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation website The omission of major changes, though, was ""key"" in reaching a compromise, according to an expert who wrote a paper on the bill negotiations. It was also one of the reasons Budd opposed it, according to senior campaign advisor Jonathan Felts.  ""The 2018 Farm Bill stripped out the important reforms that would have promoted more stringent work requirements for those receiving welfare assistance,"" Felts said. The Walker campaign, for its part, pointed out that Trump announced efforts to increase work requirements when he signed the bill. ""Millions of able-bodied, working-age adults continue to collect food stamps without working or even looking for work,"" Trump said during the bill-signing ceremony on Dec. 20. ""Therefore, I have directed (Agriculture Secretary Sonny) Perdue to use his authority under the law to close work requirement loopholes in the food stamp program. Under this new rule, able-bodied adults without dependents will have to work, or look for work, in order to receive their food stamps."" But that effort was separate from the farm bill, and quickly faced legal challenges. Last October, a federal judge blocked Trump’s rule to apply work requirements through the Agriculture Department. Apart from the SNAP benefits, PolitiFact wondered if the Budd campaign’s description of farm subsidies was accurate. In that email to PolitiFact, Felts described it this way: ""As any family farmer will tell you, you don’t support the farm by giving away the farm, and the 2018 Farm bill was bloated with overspending that also left out critical reforms to federal farm subsidies that would have better directed federal assistance to small, family farms that needed it the most."" Vincent Smith, an agriculture policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed that the bill was bloated. Virtually ""any self respecting economist would say that money is flowing to folks that don’t need it and businesses that would be perfectly viable without it,"" Smith told PolitiFact NC in a phone interview. What about Budd’s claim that the bill left out reforms that would have ""directed federal assistance to small, family farms that needed it?"" Smith said Budd has a point, but that his explanation could give people a misconception about American farm ownership. ""The candidate is right that these monies (in the farm bill) were heavily targeted to the largest farms,"" Smith said. ""Now, 98% of all farms would describe themselves as family-owned farms. Only 2% are owned by significant corporate entities."" In other words, it would be misleading to suggest the farm bill didn’t help family farms. It did. But Budd is right that larger farms benefit the most from the government’s system for offering more subsidies to farms that produce more crops. To be clear, the bill when signed simply renewed many of the agriculture policies that were already law. And while many agricultural groups supported the bill, it also had its critics. Farm Aid, the group founded by Willie Nelson and other musicians, commended Congress for finally passing the legislation. However, it said the bill ""fails spectacularly"" to address the core challenges facing farms. ""The future of family farm agriculture requires a dramatic shift in policy towards fair pricing, supply management programs, cracking down on corporate goliaths and accelerated attention to the climate crisis. By those standards, this farm bill fails,"" the group wrote on Dec. 20. Walker said that he voted for the farm bill, which ""added work requirements for able-bodied adults"" and that Budd voted no. It’s true that Walker voted for the bill that Trump signed and Budd voted against it. However, it’s misleading for Walker to say the bill ""added work requirements for able-bodied adults."" Walker voted for more work requirements in a bill the House passed in June, but the version that Trump signed didn’t include those requirements.  The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C468EC0>],/factchecks/2021/aug/03/mark-walker/trumps-farm-bill-food-stamps-and-north-carolinas-g/

McAuliffe claim about record education spending is flawed
","Once and possibly future Gov. Terry McAuliffe is urging voters to look at his record for funding schools. In a recent TV ad, the Democrat says he worked with ""reasonable Republicans to get things done"" when he led Virgina from 2014 to 2018. Among those accomplishments, McAuliffe notes that school funding increased by $1 billion funding during his term. White letters appear on the screen saying, ""Under Terry McAuliffe record investment in education."" McAuliffe has been saying he set the record for K-12 funding since midway through his governorship and we’ve previously rated his claim Mostly False. Here’s why. McAuliffe’s claim is based on raw dollars — money that has not been adjusted for inflation. When he took office, the raw dollar record for state aid to education was $6.4 billion, set nearly six years earlier during the 2008-09 school year in the last budget before the Great Recession. Democrat Tim Kaine was governor. Virginia finally broke that record in 2016, when McAuliffe signed a budget with $6.5 billion in general funds for K-12 during the school year that began late that summer. In 2017, McAuliffe inked his final budget, authorizing $6.8 billion for K-12 — a high mark, again. In raw dollars, McAuliffe also signed budgets that broke the state record of funding $5,248 per student — also set during the 2008-09 school year. His final budget, in 2017-18, allocated $5,444 per pupil. McAuliffe’s campaign cites these figures, which PolitiFact has noted in the past, as proof of his claim that he made a ""record investment"" in education.  ""Every time this fact has been looked into, it has been clear that as Virginia’s 72nd Governor Terry McAuliffe invested more dollars into education than any other governor before him, which is the definition of a record investment,"" Renzo Oliveri, McAuliffe’s campaign spokesperson, wote in an email. But Oliveri omits an important factor we’ve noted in past fact checks on whether K-12 funding truly reached new heights during McAuliffe’s term. There’s a problem with comparing historic spending levels in terms of the raw money that was appropriated each year: A dollar spent today or in the future doesn’t buy as much as a buck spent in the past. So we’ve taken more meaningful looks at whether McAuliffe brought school spending to new heights by adjusting for inflation. Under this measurement, as we’ve noted before, McAuliffe is not the record holder. We adjusted each of the education budgets this century to 2018 dollars, using the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator. The high-water mark came in the 2008-09 school year, when the state spent an adjusted $7.5 billion on public education. That figure exceeds the peak $6.8 billion expenditure — in raw dollars — in McAuliffe’s 2017-18 budget. In adjusted dollars, McAuliffe’s peak education budget in 2017-18 falls below the three state budgets that were in effect from July 2006 through June 2009. We applied the same inflation adjustments to per-pupil spending, which is the gold standard in evaluating education budgets because it takes enrollment into account.  The glory days for state spending per student once again occurred during the budgets from July 2006 to June 2009. Virginia, in adjusted 2018 dollars, spent $5,675 to $5,966 per pupil during those school years. McAuliffe’s peak proposal of $5,444 per student during the 2017-18 school year didn’t rise to that level. It’s taken a long time for Virginia to recover all the ground lost to the Great Recession. The inflation-adjusted education budget for the 2021-22 school year will be the first to pass the high-water mark set 12 years ago.    McAuliffe’s ad says that under the former governor there was ""a record investment in education."" In raw dollars, McAuliffe did sign budgets during his last two years that set state records for overall education spending and per-student outlays. But for historical spending comparisons to have meaning, inflation must be considered. When it is, McAuliffe’s claim comes up short. We rate McAuliffe’s statement Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809718C640>],/factchecks/2021/aug/02/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-claim-about-record-education-spending-fl/

Reinfection rates do not tell the whole story about protection against COVID-19
","Israel led the world with its COVID-19 vaccination campaign, launching in December 2020 and quickly vaccinating the majority of those over age 60. Because of its early vaccine rollout, the country has been a bellwether for COVID-19 immunization outcomes. So the world took notice when COVID-19 cases began to rise this summer among vaccinated Israelis, and vaccine critics took aim.  ""Thanks to (Israel's) sacrifice, we now know that natural immunity is far superior with 1% experiencing re-infection while 40% of new cases were previously vx'd,"" read one viral Facebook post.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The figures in the statement appear to be based on media reports, but they lack important context. As of late July, vaccinated people represented a higher percentage of new COVID-19 cases in Israel than those who are unvaccinated. But among Israelis who were fully vaccinated and experienced breakthrough infections, the COVID-19 vaccine was 88% effective in preventing the need for hospitalization and 91% effective against severe illness.  Comparing reinfection rates to gauge protection against the virus, as the claim does, ignores the dangers of contracting COVID-19, which is how natural immunity occurs. Israel’s data from January and July shows the differences in risk for an unvaccinated and vaccinated population.  In January, when the country’s vaccine campaign was still in its early stages and infections were peaking, there were 1,100 patients in serious condition. On July 25 — with the country facing a new outbreak fueled by the delta variant, but with more than 60% of its population vaccinated — serious cases numbered 101.  In January, Israel recorded 1,471 deaths from COVID-19, compared with 49 deaths in the month ended Aug. 2. Now, about 1.6% of cases in Israel become critically ill, compared with 4% during an earlier wave of cases when vaccine coverage was low, according to a tweet by Eran Segal, a scientist at Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science who tracks COVID-19 data.  The Facebook post was an image of a July 17 tweet by Del Bigtree, chief executive officer of Informed Consent Action Network, a U.S. anti-vaccination group, who has spread misinformation before. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Bigtree has made misleading claims about the risks to children of wearing masks and spread other false claims about the virus.  A Facebook post claimed, ""Thanks to (Israel's) sacrifice, we now know that natural immunity is far superior with 1% experiencing re-infection while 40% of new cases were previously vx'd."" The figures lack important context. Calling natural immunity ""far superior"" ignores the dangers of contracting COVID-19, which is how natural immunity occurs. And the claim ignores the effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing hospitalization and severe illness.  Data shows that among Israelis who experienced breakthrough infections, COVID-19 vaccines were 88% effective against hospitalization and 91% effective against severe illness. And with a majority of its population vaccinated, Israel has seen huge reductions in serious cases and deaths.  The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

No, Novak Djokovic did not refer to Simone Biles when he said ‘pressure is a privilege’
","After U.S. gymnast Simone Biles cited mental health concerns and the pressure to win in her decision to pull out of several event finals at the Tokyo Olympics, she received both praise and criticism. According to a viral Facebook image, top-ranked tennis player Novak Djokovic of Serbia had his own take on Biles’ decision. A quote attributed to him overlaps side-by-side photos of Djokovic and Biles and reads, ""Pressure is a privilege, my friend. Without pressure there is no professional sport.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Djokovic did say this, but it’s not clear that he was ""commenting on Simone Biles,"" as the post asserts. Reuters reported that Djokovic made the comment on July 28 as he prepared to face the pressures of completing what’s known as a Golden Slam, which is winning all four tennis Grand Slam singles titles and a gold medal at the Olympics in a calendar year. The only tennis player to accomplish this feat was West Germany’s Steffi Graf in 1988. Reuters reporter Sudipto Ganguly said he asked Djokovic the following question: ""Novak, you would've heard about Simone Biles yesterday talking about mental health and the pressure of performing. You are in this position going for the Golden Slam, you know, there is no more pressure on a tennis player than you currently. Can you speak a bit about it?"" Djokovic responded by referencing his work on the tennis court, a mention that is omitted in the social media post, but which we highlight here in bold. Here’s how Ganguly’s article framed it: ""Pressure is a privilege,"" Djokovic said when asked about the attention on him after reaching the singles quarter-finals and also winning a mixed doubles match on Wednesday. ""Without pressure there is no professional sport. If you are aiming to be at the top of the game you better start learning how to deal with pressure. And how to cope with those moments on the court but also off the court, all the expectations."" Djokovic did throw his racket and smashed another one during his July 31 match where he lost his chance to get a bronze medal. This was after another two losses on July 30, when he missed a shot at a gold medal in singles and mixed doubles. Djokovic then pulled out of the bronze medal match in mixed doubles, citing a shoulder injury. Djokovic has lost his cool on the court before. At the 2020 U.S. Open, he was disqualified after he hit a ball toward the back of the court in anger and the ball hit a line judge in the neck. ""Pressure is a privilege,"" was the title of tennis legend Billie Jean King’s 2008 autobiography. Djokovic has referenced the quote before, crediting King for the ""wonderful quote"" that describes a mindset he said he tries to stand by. A Facebook post claimed that Novak Djokovic was commenting on Simone Biles when he said ""pressure is a privilege.""  The Reuters reporter who asked the question did mention Biles in his question, but it’s not clear that Djokovic’s response was about Biles.

No evidence that Olympics barred gymnast Simone Biles from using a medication
","The day before it was announced that gymnast Simone Biles would return to the Olympics competition in Tokyo, a social media post suggested that she had earlier withdrawn because she was prevented from taking medication for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The image of a tweet shared on Facebook says of the six-time Olympic medalist: ""So they didn’t allow Simone to take her ADHD medication because it was considered a substance then become surprised when she’s unable to focus and is fearful of making a bad move on the floor."" The post, from an account with more than 500,000 Facebook followers, seemed to indicate that the medication is a banned substance. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biles has acknowledged taking medication for ADHD in the past.  But we could find no statements from Biles or made on her behalf regarding whether she was taking ADHD medication leading up to the Tokyo Games. And we found no evidence that she was prohibited from taking any medication in Tokyo. ADHD is a disorder commonly diagnosed in childhood that often lasts into adulthood. People who have it might have trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors, or being overly active. In 2016, hackers leaked medical records showing that Biles tested positive for methylphenidate, a prescription drug commonly used to treat ADHD; its brand names include Ritalin.  Biles responded to the leak by saying that she has ADHD and takes medicine for it.  Biles received a ""therapeutic use exemption"" through the World Anti-Doping Agency to compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics. The 24-year-old Texan, whose motto on her personal website is ""Don’t Flip Out,"" withdrew from the finals of the team competition during the competition in Tokyo on July 27.  USA Gymnastics said it was due to a medical issue; Team USA said she had ""mental struggles.""  Biles initially said she withdrew to work on her ""mindfulness,"" alluding to stress and saying she puts ""mental health first.""  Later, she said she withdrew because of the ""twisties,"" which she described as a dangerous condition that prevents her from doing certain maneuvers in mid-air. She said that her ""mind and body are simply not in sync"" and that ""physical health is mental health.""  Biles withdrew from more events before the announcement that she would return for the balance beam final on Aug. 3. Representatives from Team USA and for Biles did not respond to our requests for comment.

Why Rubio’s critique of Lloyd Austin’s face shield falls short
","On July 29, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin shared a video of himself deplaning in the Philippines wearing a face mask and clear face shield. It was part of a trip to Southeast Asia that included stops in Singapore and Vietnam. Later that day, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted the video and said: ""Our @SecDef is vaccinated. But he arrives in the Philippines wearing a mask AND face shield. Embarrassing COVID theatre.""  Carla Babb, Pentagon correspondent for the Voice of America, responded that she was traveling with Austin as a member of the press and that, prior to arrival, reporters were told that ""the Philippines required everyone getting off @SecDef’s plane to wear a mask and face shield.""  Dave Brown, defense editor for Politico, also responded with information from the U.S. Embassy in the Philippines. ""The Philippine government has mandated that everyone must wear full-coverage face shields together with face masks while in public places,"" he tweeted, quoting information available on the embassy’s website. ""Local governments continue to implement additional requirements to slow the virus’ spread.""   Rubio fired back with four pictures, including three in which Austin isn’t wearing a face shield.  ""I guess the face shield mandate was lifted shortly after he landed,"" Rubio tweeted on July 30.  Did Austin defy local law?  We reached out to Rubio’s office but didn’t receive a response. But here’s what we know about the photos he shared. The first image is a still from a video Austin tweeted. He’s wearing a face mask and a face shield and meeting with Rodrigo Duterte, president of the Philippines. He fistbumps with Duterte, who is wearing a mask but not a face shield.  The second image is another Austin shared that shows him standing with Delfin Lorenzana, defense secretary of the Philippines, wearing a face mask but no shield. He held a joint press conference with Lorenzana at the Camp Aguinaldo military camp in Manila, Philippines.  In a video taken before the photo was taken, both men are wearing face shields as they meet and fistbump. Lorenzana then moves to take his shield off and both men pose and wave without them.  But as Brown noted, the third and fourth images, both of which show Austin wearing a face mask without a shield, weren’t taken in the Philippines. One shows Austin in Hanoi, Vietnam, on July 29 and the other shows him in Singapore on July 27. When we reached out to the Defense Department, a Pentagon spokesperson told us that it received guidance to wear the face shield to the maximum extent possible, especially inside, unless invited by the host nation to remove it. In the picture in which Austin was seen not wearing a shield, the spokesperson said, Lorenzana had invited Austin to remove the face shield during official photos so as not to avoid the glare of camera flashes. Our ruling Rubio shared photos of Austin and suggested they show that the defense secretary wasn’t wearing a shield in the Philippines even though it was required by local law. Two of those photos weren’t taken in the Philippines. A third photo shows Austin without a shield in Manila, but a Pentagon spokesperson said that he was invited to remove it. Video footage from before that photo was taken shows him wearing it as the defense secretary from the Philippines removes his own.
