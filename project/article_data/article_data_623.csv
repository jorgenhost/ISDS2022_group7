Seniors' group warns about risks of electronic health records
","
Could Big Brother — or garden-variety snoopers — soon get their hands on your medical data? The Senior Citizens League, a group that boasts 1.2 million members and is affiliated with the Retired Enlisted Association, recently sent out a mailing saying it was possible.


According to a copy obtained by the Huffington Post, the group sent a four-page letter, along with a questionnaire and a cover letter signed by former Rep. David Funderburk, R-N.C., to seniors, expressing two related concerns about Democratic health care reform plans being debated on Capitol Hill. One is that they could lead to the rationing of care. The other is that the government is assembling a ""national government computer network"" that will contain Americans' medical files.


We've already addressed

the question of rationing

, so we'll focus here on the plans for a computer network.

 

Here's what the Senior Citizens League letter said:


""The key to these changes is a massive national government computer network, which is now being created. When it is complete, your complete medical record will be available 24 hours a day to health care workers at computer terminals in pharmacies, doctors' offices and hospitals across the country and to government workers. ... To ensure that all doctors, hospitals and pharmacies participate and place their records in the new system, a portion of the economic stimulus legislation passed in February includes stiff penalties for doctors and hospitals which do not participate. The complete lack of privacy or confidentiality that comes when millions of people can see your records and the virtual certainty of computer errors has raised concern among many Medicare beneficiaries.""


First, a little background on health information technology, or HIT for short.


Computerizing medical records has long been a goal of policymakers across the ideological spectrum. The idea is to shift from paper-based records to electronic ones, so that doctors can access information about their patients more quickly and easily and make better clinical decisions as a result. Supporters hope that HIT will reduce the frequency of medical errors, unnecessary diagnostic tests and inappropriate treatments.


While the biggest impact would likely be felt within a patient's small circle of physicians, nurses and pharmacists, planners also envision scenarios in which an emergency room doctor treating a patient traveling far from home would be able to quickly receive medical records about that patient. Officials also hope that, in the longer term, streamlining record-keeping could bring down the rapidly escalating cost of health care.


In 2004, President George W. Bush issued an executive order creating incentives for the use of health information technology, to be spearheaded by a new federal official, the national coordinator for Health Information Technology. President Barack Obama went further when Congress passed his economic stimulus package in February 2009. The stimulus included several items designed to promote HIT, including $19 billion over four years to fund electronic infrastructure improvements and the widespread adoption of electronic health records by providers. The goal under both presidents has been to create electronic health records for each person in the United States by 2014.


The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology describes the Nationwide Health Information Network as a ""network of networks."" All the experts we spoke to, including the Department of Health and Human Services, emphasized that it is not a single database residing at, say, a federal agency. It's more accurately viewed as a network to link many separate databases where records already exist, such as regional databases or medical offices, along with efforts to establish common technical standards so that these far-flung repositories of data can exchange information as needed.

 

""While providers will eventually be required to actively exchange patient information between electronic health records, there is no law or regulation calling for the development of a national patient information database,"" said Brian Wagner, the senior director of policy and public affairs with the eHealth Initiative, a group that represents companies and professional organizations with a stake in HIT.


The Senior Citizens League excerpt raises two main questions about HIT.


—

Who would have access to the network? Could it be as many as ""millions"" of people?



Our experts agreed that such loose access is certainly not the goal of the program, and they added that intensive efforts are being taken to prevent that from happening.


On its Web site, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology says it understands that a lack of trust in the system would be a serious problem. ""Coordinated attention at the federal and state levels is needed both to develop and implement appropriate privacy and security policies,"" the office says.


Portions of the stimulus bill stiffened existing privacy protections from the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act, which governs how medical records can be used. The stimulus extended the list of mandatory protections and penalties to business associates of medical providers who were already covered by them. In the case of privacy breaches, patients now must be notified, and the penalties for violations were increased.


Most important, providers and associates covered by HIPAA must limit disclosure of private health information to the minimum number of people necessary to accomplish a valid purpose. Those purposes generally involve treatment, payment or medical administration.


""It's not going to be available at Kinko's for all the world to see,"" said Len Nichols, director of the health policy program at the centrist-to-liberal New America Foundation.


Wagner said that the network won't be structured in a way that allows any medical professional to fish around for data on anyone they like. Users would still have to request specific information from another doctor, and provide a good reason why they need it. The main difference under a functioning system of HIT would be that that record would be sent electronically rather than faxed or mailed, potentially saving hours or days.


One upside is that, unlike paper-based systems, electronic health records create audit trails every time they're accessed, meaning that HIT systems can actually afford greater privacy protections for patients.


""The level of access to this information will also be limited based on each person’s role in the provision of care,"" said HHS spokeswoman Nancy Szemraj. ""Depending upon the type of violation, fines can reach up to $1.5 million per privacy violation."" The notion that there will be ""unauthorized, limitless access to patient health information in an electronic health record is absolutely incorrect,"" she said.


Still, everyone agrees that vigilance is needed. Deven McGraw, director of the health privacy project at the Center for Democracy & Technology, calls it ""absolutely critical to have policies to say who can access information and for what purposes. Are they in place today? No. Are there active efforts going on today to change that? Absolutely.""

 

—

How stiff are the penalties for noncompliance?

They're not immediate, and providers will have many opportunities to benefit from carrots before they face any sticks.


Between 2011 and 2014, the stimulus provides bonus payments to encourage health care providers to implement ""meaningful"" usage of HIT for Medicare and Medicaid. In 2015, the penalties begin. Providers who haven't instituted meaningful use of HIT would see their Medicare reimbursements (though not their Medicaid payments) reduced by 1 percent in 2015, 2 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in 2017. The secretary of Health and Human Services can increase these penalties by an additional point or two if implementation significantly lags.
 
So let's summarize. The Senior Citizens League has a point that HIT presents unprecedented challenges in privacy and security, and that strategies to keep up with these threats continue to evolve. However, the group significantly overstates the degree to which HIT is intended to collect medical data in one place and the extent to which users will be able to poke around records that they don't have a legitimate need to access. It's inaccurate to say that there will be a ""complete lack of privacy or confidentiality;"" laws against unauthorized use are already in place, and federal officials have explicitly made privacy a high priority. Finally, the penalties against nonparticipation that the group cites begin in 2015 — after several years in which providers can receive financial bonuses for participating. On balance, we find the group's claims Barely True.

Coulter says husbands rarely beat up their wives
","On his Fox News show, commentator Sean Hannity defended Rush Limbaugh, who was dumped by business partners bidding to buy the St. Louis Rams due to controversy about racial comments Limbaugh has made. Hannity brought on conservative pundit Ann Coulter, who argued the NFL has long been ""easily very spooked by crazy left-wing hoaxes."" ""You'll remember a few years ago the loopiest hoax of all, the claim that men beat up their wives more on Super Bowl Sunday,"" Coulter said. She noted that in 1993, the NFL ran a public service announcement about domestic violence before the Super Bowl after some women's groups claimed violence against women spiked on Super Bowl Sunday. ""The NFL not only believed it, and it was completely a fraud and completely insane,"" Coulter said. ""The safest people in the world ... are married women."" ""Husbands rarely beat up their wives,"" Coulter told Hannity. ""Single women get beaten up more."" The popular myth about increased domestic violence on Super Bowl Sundays turned out to be based on extremely thin, localized data and was largely, and famously, debunked in a  Washington Post  story, ""Debunking the 'Day of Dread' for Women; Data Lacking for Claim of Domestic Violence Surge After Super Bowl,"" written by Ken Ringle and published on the day of that 1993 Super Bowl game. So Coulter was on firm ground there. But we were curious whether she was right about her claim that ""husbands rarely beat up their wives. Single women get beaten up more."" Coulter goes into this subject in a little more detail in her book,  Guilty: Liberal 'Victims' and Their Assault on America.  The gist of the narrative is that liberals have created all kinds of ""victim"" myths to advance their agenda. In the second chapter, ""Victim of Crime? Thank a Single Mother,"" Coulter takes aim at a 1994   Time  magazine  article written by Barbara Ehrenreich. The article claims that, ""for a woman, home is, statistically speaking, the most dangerous place to be,"" but Coulter calls that ""crazy wrong."" Coulter leaves off Ehrenreich's next sentence, ""Her worst enemies and potential killers are not strangers but lovers, husbands and those who claimed to love her once."" Remember that last line as we get to the statistics. But first, here's how Coulter lays out her case in her book: ""According to the U.S. Department of Justice crime statistics, domestic abuse is virtually nonexistent for married women living with their husbands. From 1993 to 2005, the number of married women victimized by their husbands ranged from 0.9 to 3.2 per 1,000. Domestic violence was about 40 times more likely among divorced or separated women, ranging from 37.7 to 118.5 per 1,000. Even never-married women were more than twice as likely to be victims of domestic abuse as married women. Evidently, the safest place for a woman to be is at home with her husband."" The numbers cited by Coulter come from the Department of Justice's Bureau of Statistics report,  ""Intimate Partner Violence in the United States.""  The survey found that ""on average from 2001 to 2005, both females and males who were separated or divorced had the greatest risk of nonfatal intimate partner violence while persons who were married or widowed reported the lowest risk of violence."" Between 2001 and 2005, 1.2 out of 1,000 married women reported physical abuse by an ""intimate partner"" (in this case, their husband), versus 5.5 out of 1,000 among women who never married. In short, Coulter cites the numbers accurately. But she left out some important qualifiers included in the survey's fine print. A page about the survey's methodology states: ""Caution is warranted when interpreting intimate partner violence and marital status in the (survey) because marital status may be related to a respondent's willingness or ability to disclose violence by an intimate partner. For example, a married woman may not view, may not wish to view, or may be unable to report the behavior of her partner as violent or criminal. That same woman, if separated or divorced, may view or may be able to report the same behavior as violent."" In other words, a woman who is still married to an abusive husband may be less likely to report the abuse than a woman who has since divorced or separated from their spouse. In addition, the survey notes, ""Marital status is based on the respondent's situation at the time of the interview, not necessarily at the time of the victimization. The survey is not able to determine whether a victim's marital status changed between the victimization and the interview, not necessarily at the time of the victimization."" It stands to reason that at least some married women who reported physical abuse by their husband might have later gotten divorced or separated. Coulter also leaves out the Department of Justice statistics on homicides committed by a person ""intimate"" with the victim. Historically, most ""intimate"" homicides involved spouses (though in recent years, the number of deaths by boyfriends and girlfriends was about the same). Coulter accurately cites figures from the Department of Justice study on violence against women, but she draws conclusions that the authors of the study specifically caution against. And that's because women may be a lot less likely to report violence by someone they are still married to, and living with. And so we rate Coulter's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2009/oct/22/ann-coulter/coulter-says-husbands-rarely-beat-their-wives/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'The Freedom Project']","
Freedom Project claims the deficit is the biggest in history — and that Democrats are to blame
","
On Oct. 16, 2009, the Treasury Department confirmed what we all expected: The deficit is big — about $1.42 trillion big.

 

It didn't take long for Republicans to use that massive number to criticize Democrats.

 

""Last week, the U.S. Treasury announced that Washington Democrats rang up a $1.42 trillion budget deficit in 2009 — the single largest in American history,"" said an Oct. 19, 2009, message from the Freedom Project, a Republican political action committee led by House Republican Leader John Boehner. ""But that isn't slowing their push for more government spending, a jobs-killing national energy tax, and a costly government takeover of health care.""

 

We were curious about the first two parts of the Freedom Project's statement: that Democrats are responsible and that the deficit was the largest in history. 

 

It's important to note the months included in that deficit. In Washington, number-crunchers think in terms of fiscal years, which begin on Oct. 1 and end on Sept. 30. So when officials talk about the deficit for 2009, it is based on the budget year from October 2008 through September 2009. The spending for that year was largely determined before President Barack Obama took office by a Congress controlled by Democrats and a Republican president, George W. Bush.

 

It's also important to understand the difference between the national deficit and the national debt. The former refers to how much money the government spends against revenues in a year, while the latter is the cumulative amount the government owes. So, the Treasury Department is estimating the 2009 deficit is $1.42 trillion while the total national debt tops out at approximately $11 trillion.

 

Whether 2009 marks the largest deficit we've ever had depends on how you look at the numbers, said Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation.

 

""In nominal and inflation-adjusted dollars, $1.42 trillion is by far the largest budget deficit in history,"" he said. ""But if you measure it by gross domestic product, it's not.""


Indeed, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts that this year's national deficit will top out at about 11.2 percent of GDP. But that would be the second highest since World War II because the deficit hit 30 percent of GDP in 1943.
 
Still, the 2009 number is high. To put it in perspective, the deficit was only 3.2 percent of GDP in 2008, or about $459 billion.


Economists prefer using the GDP number for comparisons because it accounts for inflation and other changes in the economy, Riedl said.


Today's deficit of ""$1.4 trillion isn't comparable to what it was back then,"" Riedl said. ""Income was lower, prices were lower.""


Figuring out who's responsible for all this spending is trickier.


According to the CBO, spending increased by 24 percent from fiscal year 2008 to 2009 — the largest increase since 1952.


Much of that increase is the result of big-ticket items enacted in 2008, including $133 billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and $291 billion for bailing out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Obama administration tacked on an additional $115 billion in stimulus spending in 2009. Other big spending items include a bill to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. On top of that, tax revenue is down about $400 billion, because individual income and corporate profits have dropped due to the economic downturn.


To calculate how much responsibility Democrats had, we examined the votes for the big-ticket items.


•

The Omnibus.

Congress did not complete work on nine of the 13 appropriations bills before Obama was elected, so the work was delayed until he took office and the bills were bundled together into what's known as an omnibus spending bill. Congress passed the $410 billion package with support from 16 Republicans in the House. The Senate approved the measure by voice vote, so there's no way to know how many Republicans supported it.


•

The TARP

. President Bush asked for the TARP funding, and in both chambers, Republicans voted for the measure (91 House Republicans and 34 Senate Republicans, to be exact).


•

The economic stimulus bill.

It passed with very little GOP support; no House Republicans voted for it, and only three Senate Republicans did.


•

War funding

. It passed in June 2009 with only five GOP votes in the House and 36 in the Senate.
 
We should mention that today's deficit is also the result of policies put in place under the Bush administration such as tax cuts, the war in Iraq and new Medicare prescription drug coverage.


Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, discussed the predicament in a June 9, 2009,

New York Times

article about whom to blame for the deficit:


""Bush behaved incredibly irresponsibly for eight years,"" he said. ""On the one hand, it might seem unfair for people to blame Obama for not fixing it. On the other hand, he’s not fixing it.""


That brings us back to the Freedom Project's claim. By one standard — total dollars — the group is right that fiscal year 2009 will have the largest deficit in history. But it comes up second if you measure it by share of GDP, as many economists prefer. As for the second part, it's not correct to blame all the spending on Democrats. Yes, the Obama administration and the Democratic-led Congress are responsible for a good chunk of that spending — but many elements were backed by lots of Republicans, including President Bush. The Freedom Project glosses over this important detail, so we rate the claim Half True.

Sarah Palin says health care reform will raise taxes on the middle class
","
Sarah Palin likes communicating directly with her fans via Facebook, where she's posted several notes about health care reform. In her latest note, titled ""Good Intentions Aren't Enough with Health Care Reform,"" Palin criticized a proposal from the Senate Finance Committee as misguided and too expensive.
 
Her note includes several criticisms of the Democratic proposal. We wanted to look specifically at what she had to say about excise taxes on high-dollar health plans. 
 
""Supposedly the Senate Finance bill will be paid for by cutting Medicare by nearly half a trillion dollars and by taxing the so-called 'Cadillac' health care plans enjoyed by many union members,"" Palin wrote.
 
Those taxes and others will ultimately be passed on to consumers, she said.
 
""The Senate Finance bill is effectively a middle class tax increase, and as (economist Douglas) Holtz-Eakin points out, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation those making less than $200,000 will be hit hardest,"" she said. Palin was referring to an

op-ed Holtz-Eakin

wrote for the

Wall Street Journal

; you may remember he was the chief economic adviser to John McCain during the presidential campaign.
 
We wanted to know if she was right that the taxes on 'Cadillac' plans would hit people who make less than $200,000 the hardest.
 
The excise tax works in a roundabout way. Under the Senate Finance proposal from Sen. Max Baucus, insurance companies would have to pay a 40 percent excise tax on health insurance policies that exceed $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families; they would pay taxes on the amount that exceeds those thresholds. We spoke with three economists on both the left and the right, and they all agreed that insurance companies will not simply absorb the new tax; they will pass it along in the form of even higher premiums. Employers will then try to avoid the new higher costs by buying cheaper health plans.
 
Finally, the economists agreed that if employers have to scale back on health plans, they will eventually pay higher wages as they seek to retain workers. At this point, disgruntled workers may say ""Yeah, right,"" but the economists were adamant that it is the case. There are data that we won't get into now that back up their point.
 
Here's where the analysis that Palin mentioned by the Joint Committee, which is nonpartisan and advises Congress on tax policy, comes in: At the Senate's request, it tried to figure out the effect of the excise tax on federal taxes collected. Like the economists we talked to, the Joint Committee also believes that wages will rise if employers select lower-priced health insurance, and the government gets to tax those higher wages. So the Joint Committee created a series of tables projecting how much additional income tax would be collected over the next 10 years. By 2019, about 87 percent of those people paying higher taxes would make less than $200,000, according to an analysis of the preliminary Senate Finance proposal.
 
So here's what that means: If workers end up getting paid more, they'll also be taxed more.
 
We have to point out that this analysis counts tax filers who would see

any

tax increase due to the excise tax proposal, and it doesn't give details on how much they would pay on average. And the excise tax only has the effect of increasing taxes for those who have high-dollar plans, roughly 25 percent or less of all tax filers in 2019. These are plans that generally have very low co-pays and lots of extras. A


Boston Globe

report

described one plan as offering free surgery, free rehab for alcoholism, and reimbursements for yoga classes. CEOs have these types of plans, but so do some unionized workers. One of the economists we spoke with said they are usually offered by state and local governments and universities, the types of jobs known for great benefits. The plan the

Boston Globe

described was for state workers in New Hampshire.
 
Still, the economists we talked to agreed that the excise tax would affect many people who make less than $200,000. And other parts of the bill wouldn't offset that.
 
• ""You would expect that over time the number of people who are exposed to this would grow,"" said Stephen Zuckerman, a health economist at the left-leaning Urban Institute. He still thinks it's a good idea. ""If you really want to do health care reform, and expand Medicaid and provide subsidies for low-income people, you have to provide some way to pay for it. Putting a limit on the amount of insurance that can be tax-free is not unreasonable.""
 
 • ""The tax is not simply going to affect millionaires, it's going to affect some people who are middle income,"" said Paul Van de Water of the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Van de Water has nevertheless written a

lengthy defense of the excise tax

.
 
• ""Clearly a number of these provisions, this one included, will increase taxes on people below the $200,000 income level,"" said Ed Haislmaier, a senior research fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""The idea that this is just for senior managers is actually quite wrong.""
 
Back to Palin: She said that according to the Joint Committee's report ""those making less than $200,000 will be hit hardest"" by the excise tax. We want to emphasize that the tax will affect only a minority of taxpayers. But Palin is right that of the taxpayers it does affect, a majority make less than $200,000, according to the Joint Committee analysis. It turns out a lot of regular Joes and Janes have those 'Cadillac' plans. We rate her statement Mostly True.

Left-leaning group opposes excise tax on 'Cadillac' plans as a hit to the middle class
","
Unions are usually supporters of the Democratic plans for health reform, but there's one thing they don't like: an excise tax on high-dollar health care plans, popularly known as ""Cadillac"" plans.
 
Health Care for America Now, a coalition that includes unions, has launched an ad attacking the excise tax, which was included in a version of health reform authored by Sen. Max Baucus and approved by the Senate Finance Committee on Oct. 13.
 
Here's what the ad says: ""We all know America needs real health care reform, but there's a right way and a wrong way to pay for it. Some senators say they want to tax so-called 'Cadillac' health care plans, but those proposals will also tax the benefits of millions of middle-class workers. There's a better way. Let's ask individuals making more than $250,000 to pay their fair share.""
 
We're checking the facts behind the text that flashes on the screen during the ad: ""40% tax on health care benefits of middle-class workers.""
 
The excise tax works in a roundabout way. Under the Senate Finance proposal, insurance companies would have to pay a 40 percent excise tax on health insurance policies that exceed $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families. We spoke with three economists on both the left and the right, and they all agreed that insurance companies will not simply absorb the new tax; they will pass it along in the form of higher premiums. Employers will then try to avoid the new higher costs by buying cheaper health plans.
 
Finally, the economists agreed that if employers have to scale back on health plans, they will eventually pay higher wages as they seek to retain workers. At this point, disgruntled workers may say ""Yeah, right,"" but the economists were adamant that it is the case. Those higher wages are taxable, and that's how it becomes a tax increase for workers. An analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is nonpartisan and advises Congress on tax policy, confirmed this point. The Joint Committee found that many people affected by this make less than $200,000. (For more details on this Joint Committee analysis, see our report on someone else who doesn't like the excise tax:

Sarah Palin

.)
 
So here's what that means: If workers end up getting paid more, they'll also be taxed more.
 
Another point worth emphasizing is that the 40 percent tax is on the portion of the health plan that exceeds $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families. It's not on the whole plan.
 
We should point out here that many workers have no idea what their health plans cost. How do you know if you have a ""Cadillac"" plan? If you're sick of paying more and more out of pocket for health care, you probably don't have a Cadillac plan. On the other hand, if you feel like your health plan is quite generous, you might. These are plans that generally have very low co-pays and lots of extras. A

The ad says the proposal is a ""40% tax on health care benefits of middle-class workers."" But that's an overstatement that fails to mention it's an excise tax that would only affect workers with health care benefits above a certain level. Most middle-class workers won't be affected at all. We rate the statement Barely True.

"['Environment', 'National', 'Legal Issues', 'Foreign Policy', 'Christopher Monckton']","
British climate-change skeptic says Copenhagen treaty threatens ""democracy,"" ""freedom""
","
Christopher Monckton — a British hereditary peer and high-profile skeptic of both global warming and international agreements — caused a stir on Oct. 14, 2009, with a forceful denunciation of the upcoming international talks on climate change in Copenhagen, Denmark, scheduled for Dec. 7-18, 2009.


In a speech in St. Paul, Minn., Monckton called the pending agreement a ""dreadful treaty"" and said, among other things, that the parties ""are about to impose a communist world government on the world. You have a president who has very strong sympathies with that point of view. He's going to sign. He'll sign anything.""


Monckton continued, ""So, thank you, America. You were the beacon of freedom to the world. It is a privilege merely to stand on this soil of freedom while it is still free. But in the next few weeks, unless you stop it, your president will sign your freedom, your democracy, and your prosperity away forever — and neither you nor any subsequent government you may elect would have any power whatsoever to take it back again. That is how serious it is.""


For this item, we'll put aside the debate on whether it is wise to institute policies, such as emissions cuts, to curb climate change — the ""prosperity"" portion of Monckton's comment. Instead, we'll stick to analyzing Monckton's claim that an agreement coming out of the Copenhagen talks would, one, sign away American sovereignty and, two, be irreversible.


Let's start with some background. The Copenhagen meeting, which President Barack Obama is expected to attend, is part of an ongoing process sponsored by a United Nations body called the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Its goal is to secure international cooperation to curb the emission of gases that scientists blame for raising global temperatures, a development that could harm the environment.


The first — and crucially important — point to make is that there is no ""treaty"" yet. The most recent iteration is a 180-page document, posted publicly in September, called the ""reordering and consolidation of text in the revised negotiating text."" If you think that title sounds clunky, just check out the document itself: Rendered in impenetrable diplo-speak, the document offers an almost stream-of-consciousness array of alternate options, blanks to be filled in and bracketed phrases. Supporters and critics alike agree that the final text, if one emerges, will be radically shorter and clearer.


In other words, it's impossible to draw conclusions about what international leaders will be asked to sign based on the current draft.


A second point worth noting is that, due to wide differences of opinion among the 192 participating nations, the Copenhagen conference looks increasingly unlikely to produce anything ready to sign.


“There isn’t sufficient time to get the whole thing done,” Yvo De Boer, the Dutch diplomat who oversees the negotiations, said in mid October, according to the

New York Times

. “But I hope it will go well beyond simply a declaration of principles. The form I would like it to take is the groundwork for a ratifiable agreement next year.”


What we learn from these two points is that the substance of the agreement remains distinctly up in the air, and that Obama is unlikely to be asked to sign anything at the conference beyond a nonbinding statement of interim steps or a promise to meet again — if that.


Now we'll look at Monckton's argument that the Copenhagen talks could eventually produce something that eats away at American sovereignty.


Experts in international law acknowledge that, with the final draft unresolved, anything is possible. But they added that numerous safeguards would help prevent U.S. sovereignty from being yielded.


—

Signing a treaty doesn't mean that its provisions become binding

. Instead, it simply means that you

intend

to become a party to the treaty by seeking domestic approval, using whatever procedures are in effect in your country. In the United States, that means taking the treaty to the Senate for its advice and consent on ratification.


For instance, the United States signed the Kyoto Protocol on climate change — the predecessor to the agreement being negotiated in Copenhagen — but never ratified it due to opposition in the Senate. As a result, the United States was never subject to any of the protocol's rules.


—

The Senate would have to approve any binding agreement with a 67-vote supermajority

. This means that a treaty only becomes binding after a supermajority of democratically elected senators, plus the president, consent. So if the United States decides to give up some of its sovereignty in the matter of carbon emissions, it will only do so after a significant amount of political consent is given. As a practical matter, the high Senate threshold for ratifying a treaty, set by the Constitution, effectively requires broad support from lawmakers in both parties, something the Kyoto Protocol did not have. (Even after ratification, the treaty may not become binding until a certain number of nations have ratified it, depending how the treaty language is written; this could further delay or even derail the process.)


—

The Obama administration has publicly pledged that it will not sign an agreement unacceptable to Congress

. According to the

New York Times

, the chief American climate negotiator, Todd Stern, and his deputy, Jonathan Pershing, have both affirmed this position. “We are not going to be part of an agreement we cannot meet,” Pershing said at a recent negotiators’ meeting in Bangkok.


—

The negotiators are aware of sovereignty concerns and are weighing options that would limit intrusiveness

. Nigel Purvis, a former State Department negotiator under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said that the Copenhagen negotiations ""are premised on the idea that each nation would create its own low- carbon economic growth strategy,"" adding that the degree of international enforcement is very much in play. Most experts, he said, ""agree that punitive noncompliance measures are highly unlikely. Thus, the approach is really quite decentralized and respectful of national sovereignty — the opposite of being subject to a command-and-control U.N. agency.""


—

Even if the United States does eventually cede some sovereignty on climate change, ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" are not at stake

. John H. Knox, a law professor at Wake Forest University, calls Monckton's notion ""silly.""


""Any treaty limits the freedom of the parties, of course, just as any contract limits the freedom of its parties,"" Knox said. ""But none of the proposals on the table, and none that could conceivably be suggested, would deny the United States freedom to keep a democratic system of government, and no such agreement could imaginably be signed or ratified by the United States. And no treaty can override the provisions of the U.S. Constitution in any event.""


Now, for Monckton's second claim, that ""neither you nor any subsequent government you may elect would have any power whatsoever to take it back again.""


Our experts say it's nonsense. Either a country can exit a treaty using a procedure described in the treaty itself — usually involving formal notice, a delay and the forefeit of rights to have a further say in implementing or shaping the treaty in question — or it can simply walk away. Doing either would likely entail consequences for the departing country, but they would most likely be ""soft"" penalties such as loss of international esteem.


""There's nothing in any of the documents for Copenhagen that talk about any greater penalties than those,"" said Jake Schmidt, the international climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.


Of course, other countries could react to a withdrawal by pursuing bilateral or multilateral action, such as a trade embargo or a cutoff of diplomatic contacts. But they could take such actions today, even without a climate change agreement.


""Even if a new climate treaty were ratified and the United States thus became a party to it, the United States could later choose to withdraw from it,"" Knox said. ""Withdrawing from a treaty is perfectly acceptable under international law unless the treaty itself precludes it. Even in that case, the United States could always choose not to comply with the treaty, just as a person can choose to violate a domestic law, with the important difference that the international community does not have a police force standing by to arrest wrongdoing nations. The United States would not suddenly lose its discretion to decide whether to comply with the treaty, in other words.""


Steven Groves, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, acknowledges that Monckton's claims are ""perhaps overstated a bit."" But he argues that being vigilant on the sovereignty consequences of a Copenhagen agreement is still important.

 

Groves suggests that it's possible to devise an agreement that protects national sovereignty, perhaps by eliminating an international enforcement mechanism and relying instead on self-regulation by member countries. But doing so would mean instituting an agreement without much teeth, because it would require trusting countries with little transparency and a lot of self-interest to evade the rules. On the other hand, implementing a more forceful international oversight regime would likely run into more problems on the sovereignty front.


""For a treaty to be effective in ratcheting down emissions, you would need some sort of enforcement mechanism with real teeth, and that raises legitimate sovereignty concerns,"" said Ben Lieberman, another Heritage fellow.


Even so, we find Monckton's claims to not only be unsupported but preposterous. First, it's impossible to know what agreement will come out of Copenhagen, and when. Second, the U.S. procedure for ratifying treaties requires consent by a supermajority of the Senate — a steep hurdle. Third, it's hard to envision anything coming out of Copenhagen that would change the United States' bedrock principles of freedom and democracy. And fourth, contrary to what Monckton says, the United States can leave an international agreement. So while it pays to be vigilant about threats to U.S. sovereignty, this one is not the threat that Monckton's rhetoric suggests. So Lord Monckton earns a special ruling — Britches on Fire!

Gun-rights group says health care bill could harm gun owners
","
The Gun Owners of America has recently taken aim at an unlikely subject: health care reform.


In the last few weeks, GOA has sent out several action alerts to members criticizing the health care reform bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee last week. The bill, authored by Finance Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., was supported by all of the committee's Democrats, as well as Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine. It will now be merged with another Senate health care bill and go to the full Senate.


On Oct. 9, 2009, the day before the Finance Committee began voting on amendments to the Baucus bill, GOA sent an alert to members titled, ""ObamaCare Could be Used to Ban Guns in Home Self-Defense."" The conservative group speculated about the impact of the health care bill on gun owners, hypothesizing that, in a bid to control spiraling health care costs, the administration will target people who have ""excessively dangerous"" behaviors that officials believe raise the cost of health care. The group warned that gun ownership — particularly keeping ""a loaded firearm for self-defense"" — is likely to be high on that list.


The memo accuses Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius — who would have significant influence over any new health care policy — of having a ""well-established antipathy to the Second Amendment"" because she vetoed concealed-carry gun legislation when she was governor of Kansas.


The Obama administration is so antigun, the group contends, that ""it is even possible that the Obama-prescribed policy could preclude reimbursement of any kind in a household which keeps a loaded firearm for self-defense.""


In this item, we'll scrutinize the claim that the Baucus bill ""could be used to ban guns in home self-defense."" To start, we turn to the committee-passed version of the legislation itself.

 

The sweeping health care bill would leave in place the current private insurance system in which most people get coverage from their employer. But the bill would set federal rules for the individual market — that is, for policies purchased by people who are self-employed or have lost their coverage. President Barack Obama and other Democrats have often said the new rules are needed because companies that sell policies on the individual market are often able to impose restrictions about pre-existing conditions and put limitations on coverage. The rules for the individual market would also apply to the ""small group"" market, which serves smaller employers and their workers.

 

We looked carefully at the language in the Baucus bill and found no mention of either ""gun"" or ""firearm."" So there's no explicit support in the bill for the group's claim.


Okay, says GOA, but guns could still be a target because of the emphasis on discouraging unhealthy behaviors. ""The ObamaCare bill already contains language that will punish Americans who engage in unhealthy behavior by allowing insurers to charge them higher insurance premiums,"" the group said in its alert.

 

The group is right that the bill does allow higher premiums based on behavior — specifically, the use of tobacco.

 

The Baucus bill would allow insurers to alter premiums based on tobacco use, age, family composition and cost differences in different geographical regions. The bill establishes a series of ratios for how much these factors can be used to adjust premiums upward. Tobacco users, for instance, could be charged 1.5 times the standard rate under the bill. (There is no such provision in the House bill.)


Another provision could provide a loophole that allows behavioral factors to play a wider role in setting premiums.


The bill would expand some rules now in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, that allow employees to be rewarded if they participate in wellness programs. Taking part in a wellness program — such as tobacco cessation or a gym membership — can mean lower premiums or co-pays. The bill would increase the size of discounts that can be offered to beneficiaries who enroll in these programs.

 

Some advocacy groups and labor unions have warned this could be a sneaky way of excluding less-healthy workers. And Mike Hammond, GOA's legislative counsel, said that such policies indicate that the bill ""is going in a behavioral direction.""

 

So, GOA has a point that the Baucus bill opens the door to rating health insurance premiums based on behaviors. But the group is making a huge leap to suggest that could mean the government would target gun owners.


In the alert, GOA leaves out two important pieces of context.
 
—

People with ""unhealthy behaviors"" would actually get stronger protections under the Baucus bill

. Currently, states oversee the individual insurance market with a patchwork of rules. According to the Senate Finance Committee, only one state fully bars premiums from being adjusted for any reasons. Seven states allow limited adjustments for reasons such as age, while 11 allow premiums to vary based on health factors. The remaining 31 — a majority of all states — have not passed any laws restricting what factors insurers can use in setting rates.


Under Baucus's bill, the federal rules would take over and put restrictions on when insurers could charge higher premiums as we explain above. This means that for most states, gun owners — or people with other behaviors that the government might theoretically deem ""unhealthy"" — would actually get more explicit protection under the Baucus bill than they have now. Today, laws in most states would not keep an insurer from discriminating against gun owners in setting premiums; under the Baucus bill, gun owners would have this protection enshrined in law.


—

There's no indication in the bill that gun ownership is contemplated as a future factor in premium-setting

. Even if you assume that health care reform is rushing headlong into a new era in which behavior defines health premiums — which is just speculation at this point — there is nothing in the Baucus bill that says, or even suggests, that gun ownership would be cited as a behavioral factor. Every behavioral factor explicitly cited in the bill concerns pure medical issues, such as a lowered cholesterol level, maintainance of a certain body mass index, quitting smoking or losing a specified amount of weight.


GOA's Hammond argues that in his experience, bills that start narrowly have a tendency to expand their reach. ""So I don't think it is unreasonable to assume that what can be done will be done,"" he said.


But we find insufficient evidence to support the group's overheated rhetoric. Ultimately, we find that while the GOA is right that a more behavioral approach to pricing health care seems to be gaining steam, it is a giant and overly speculative leap to say that the Baucus bill ""could be used to ban guns in home self-defense."" There is nothing in the bill itself to indicate that is contemplated. We find the statement False.

Sen. Cornyn says first installment of Democrats' health reform plan would raise deficit $250 billion
","
If you heard Sen. John Cornyn's comments on CBS's

Face the Nation

on Oct. 18, 2009, you may have thought the Democrats' big health care reform plan was coming to the Senate floor this week and that it would explode the federal deficit.
 
""In fact, this week, Majority Leader Harry Reid has scheduled to vote on the first installment of health care reform, which will violate the president’s promise not to raise the deficit by one dime,"" Cornyn said. ""In fact, it will raise the deficit by $250 billion.""
 
The very same day, White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel said on CNN's

State of the Union

that the president's health care plan is ""more than deficit neutral.""
 
So what gives?
 
Emanuel is correct that the Congressional Budget Office looked at the version of the health care bill authored by Sen. Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who chairs the Finance Committee,

and concluded

that the bill would cost $829 billion over 10 years, but that offsetting funding for it would actually reduce the federal deficit by $81 billion.
 
But Cornyn's not talking about that plan. He's talking about an issue that has been largely absent from the health care debate: a proposal to fundamentally change the way doctors are paid by Medicare. 
 
Here's the backstory. For more than a decade, Medicare payments to physicians have been limited by a cost-containment formula called the Sustainable Growth Rate, which is tied to the growth rate of the economy (but not to health care costs, which have been growing faster). The problem is, it would require such deep cuts to doctors' pay that Congress has stepped in to make temporary fixes.
 
Baucus' health plan proposes another Band-Aid through 2010, but a more permanent solution is now being discussed. This week, the Senate may vote on a plan to permanently fix the payment formula. Democrats and Republicans alike are in agreement that the current formula is unrealistic. The Democrats have proposed a fix that comes with a 10-year, $245 billion price tag. Democrats so far haven't proposed any way to pay for that, hence Cornyn's comment that it would add $250 billion to the federal deficit. And to the extent that paying Medicare doctors ought to be a part of any overall health care plan, he argues, this is the ""first installment"" of the Democrats' health care reform.
 
Democrats, meanwhile, argue this is a separate issue from the current health care debate. They argue this was a broken formula that needed to be fixed no matter whether they tackled health care reform or not. So they made it a separate bill.
 
Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s, has mixed feelings about handling the physician pay issue separately from the health care reform bill.
 
To leave the $245 billion physician pay issue ""lurking around the corner is to ignore the facts,"" said Wilensky, now an economist and senior fellow with Project Hope, a health care advocacy group. Congress has been patching the issue for years, digging the problem in deeper and deeper.
 
It might be disingenuous for the Republicans to cite it as proof that the Democrats' health care plan would explode the deficit, Wilensky said. But it's also disingenuous for President Barack Obama and other Democrats to claim a deficit-neutral health care plan without mentioning this huge expense coming around the corner. To a large extent, she said, the health care debate has ""morphed into health insurance reform."" That's important, but just one of several major health care issues, such as the way the government pays doctors for Medicare.
 
""There's no question there is a significant budget issue,"" Wilensky said. ""They have been patching since 2002. What they need is a fundamental redo of how we pay physicians.""
 
Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, said Democrats are at least stepping up to address a long-standing problem, one that has been pushed along by Republicans and Democrats alike.
 
Since both sides agree the funding formula should be changed, he said, ""Separating it is a reasonable way to do it.""
 
Cornyn is right that the Medicare plan would cost nearly $250 billion and that it would add to the deficit because Democrats have not found money to offset it. And we believe he has the license for a little hyperbole that allows him to characterize it as ""the first installment"" of health care reform. However, it's not the health care reform package that has been under such heated discussion for the past few months and he misleads people by suggesting that it is — and that the reform package would add $250 billion to the deficit. So we find his claim Half True.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Pundits', 'Stimulus', 'Lou Dobbs']","
Dobbs claims stimulus jobs cost big bucks
","The Obama administration recently announced its latest tally for jobs created by the economic stimulus bill, which caught the attention television host Lou Dobbs.

""The White House today unveiled the first hard data on how many jobs the stimulus package has actually created,"" Dobbs reported on his CNN show Oct. 15, 2009. ""The number according to the government -- you may want to write this down -- 30,383. That is the total number of jobs created by companies that received just over $2 billion in stimulus money. That works out to a cost of $71,500 of taxpayer money for each job apparently created.""

Dobbs' estimate sounded high to us, so we decided to look into the claim.

But before we do that, a little stimulus 101. Shortly after he was sworn into Office, Congress passed a $787 billion bill meant to boost the economy, and President Barack Obama signed it into law. The package included about $499 billion for new road projects, school construction and alternative energy projects, among other things -- all programs meant to create jobs. The remaining $288 goes to tax relief.

On Oct. 15, the White House released the latest information on how that money is being spent. Dobbs is right that the administration estimates about 30,383 jobs have been created so far, and he's also right that about $2.172 billion of the total $499 in recovery dollars has been paid out for projects such as road construction. (All told, about $16 billion has been awarded, but not spent, on federal contracts so far.)

We talked to Kevin Burke, senior producer for  Lou Dobbs Tonight,  about the math. Turns out Dobbs simply divided the amount paid -- about $2.2 billion -- by 30,383 jobs. That comes out to be approximately $71,500. (Burke explained that they did not use the $16 billion committed to projects because they only wanted to account for money that had actually been spent. Dividing $16 billion by 30,383 actually produces a much higher number - $526,610 to be exact).

There is a caveat, however, which means that Dobbs's estimate may not show the entire picture. The job numbers reported by the administration are for positions created directly through federal contracts and do not account the broader impact as the money ripples through the economy. For example, the report reflects the number of workers hired to do a road construction project, but it does not take into account the workers hired or retained by an asphalt company supplying materials for the project.

Those auxiliary effects of the stimulus are harder to quantify, said Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal economic think tank, but they have an impact because each extra dollar helps the economy.

""People say, 'Paying people who are unemployed [in the stimulus bill] - how does that create jobs?'"" he said. ""It does, because without that money they might otherwise cut back on what they are consuming. That money does support the local grocery story, the mechanic, clothing stores.""

In economist-speak, the ripple effect Horney is talking about is officially known as the multiplier effect. It's a hallmark of Keynesian economics, which supports a government intervention in the market, and is an ongoing source of debate within the profession, said Donald Marron, president of Marron Economics and a visiting professor at Georgetown University.

If you believe more jobs are created through the multiplier effect, than presumably Dobbs's cost per job estimate would be lower, he explained.

If you're like Brian Riedl, a budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, who thinks the multiplier effect is an ""economic fallacy"" because any jobs created require the government to borrow money out of the economy in the first place, Dobbs's estimate may be closer to the mark.

Nevertheless, the economists we spoke with said his estimate likely left out some important details.

For example, some of the money is presumably being used to produce more goods and services, not just jobs, said Harry Holzer, an economist with the Urban Institute and Georgetown University.

""I think it's misleading because it ignores the indirect effects on the economy, it ignores the value of goods produced,"" Holzer said.

So Dobbs is relying on the administration's estimate and he accurately reports the numbers. But his number is fuzzy for two reasons. First, the number of jobs created or saved by the stimulus may be higher than just the 30,383 created directly by the stimulus package because of the multiplier effect (although we recognize that economists disagree about that principle). But secondly, the math may be overly simple. Just because the government has handed out $2.2 billion in stimulus funding doesn't mean every penny has been used to create jobs. It could be used to purchase materials such as asphalt and concrete. So, while he's in the ballpark, it's a somewhat incomplete picture.

Health care reform bill not that bipartisan
","
In his weekly address, President Barack Obama warned health insurance companies not to derail health care reform, and he praised the progress Congress has already made.
 
Obama said a broad coalition of supporters including ""doctors and nurses, workers and businesses, hospitals and even drug companies — folks who represent different parties and perspectives, including leading Democrats and many leading Republicans"" were pushing reform forward. 
 
""Just this week, the Senate Finance Committee approved a reform proposal that has both Democratic and Republican support,"" he said.
 
It was the last statement that caught our attention. Leaders of the majority party often boast about bipartisan support when in fact they have only a handful of votes from the minority. But in this case, Obama so far has just one Republican in the Senate.
 
The Senate Finance Committee voted to approve a version of the health care overhaul on a vote of 14-9 on Oct. 13. Sen. Olympia Snowe, a Republican from Maine, voted with the Democrats. Every other Republican on the committee opposed the measure.
 
Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican member on the committee, called the measure partisan and deeply flawed.
 
So Obama is technically correct that the proposal had ""Democratic and Republican support."" But he didn't mention that it got only one Republican vote, which meant the nine other GOP senators voted against it. That's not exactly a robust example of bipartisanship.

Democrats claim only 20 percent of Americans call themselves Republicans
","
In a recent round of partisan fighting, Democrats made a claim that piqued our curiosity: that only 20 percent of Americans identify themselves as Republicans.

 

The comment grew out of the partisan food fight that followed President Barack Obama's surprise win of the Nobel Peace prize.


Republicans criticized Obama, claiming he had accomplished little in his first nine months to deserve the award. Democrats swung back, attacking Republicans for being divisive and unpatriotic in their attacks on the president.


In a particularly heated statement, Democratic National Committee communications director Brad Woodhouse compared the Republican response to Obama's win with the responses of terrorist organizations.


""The Republican Party has thrown in its lot with the terrorists — the Taliban and Hamas this morning — in criticizing the president for receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. Republicans cheered when America failed to land the Olympics and now they are criticizing the president of the United States for receiving the Nobel Peace Prize — an award he did not seek but that is nonetheless an honor in which every American can take great pride — unless of course you are the Republican Party,"" Woodhouse said.


He continued, ""The 2009 version of the Republican Party has no boundaries, has no shame and has proved that they will put politics above patriotism at every turn. It’s no wonder only 20 percent of Americans admit to being Republicans anymore — it’s an embarrassing label to claim.""


The number surprised us, so we decided to look into Woodhouse's claim that only 20 percent of Americans identify themselves as Republican.


The accuracy of Woodhouse's remark depends on how broadly you define someone's party affiliation. Pollsters typically ask people to identify their party, but results depend on whether you also include people who say they ""lean"" to one of the parties, or whether you restrict the label to include just registered voters who are likely to vote.


Recent polls indicate he was right for broad surveys that were not limited to likely voters. According to a recent Associated Press-GfK poll, 21 percent of adults identified themselves as Republicans, while 33 percent said they were Democrats.


An early October CBS poll found basically the same numbers, and an NBC/

Wall Street Journal

poll taken in September found Republican identification at 18 percent. A check of Pollster.com, a Web site that aggregates recent polls and averages the results, reveals that, overall, about 22.5 percent of adults identify themselves as Republicans, while 33.7 percent identify themselves as Democrats, if you average recent polls. Note that these averages are a little squishy because each poll has a different margin of error, but they give a good estimate of where the country stands.


While these numbers may seem low, consider that they typically only include strong and moderate supporters of either party. ""Leaners"" — those who consider themselves independent but usually lean toward a particular party — are not included.


Also, when screened to include just registered voters who are likely to vote in the next election, the share of people identifying with a party increases: 33 percent identify with Republicans and 39 percent identify with Democrats, according to the Pollster.com average. So among the population that is politically active, a higher percentage of people identify with a party.


To put the numbers into more context, we talked to Karlyn Bowman, polling analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. She confirmed that lately the self-identified Republican number has hovered in the 20 percent range.
 
Indeed, the Pollster.com chart shows that since the November 2008 election, the Republican number declined from about 28 percent to 22.5 percent.
 
So Woodhouse is in the ballpark if you rely on a universe where all adults either identify with a party or are considered independent. But other methods used by pollsters boost the Republican percentage because they screen for voters who are registered and likely to vote, or include more voters who are ""leaners."" So we find his claim Mostly True.

Health insurers' group says Medicare Advantage beneficiaries will be hit more by reform plan
","
One of the Republicans' favorite arguments against the Democratic health care reform proposals is that seniors could be hurt by cuts to Medicare. America's Health Insurance Plans, the trade group for the health insurance industry, began running television advertisements on this point in mid October.
 
One ad, aimed at residents of Missouri, posed the following question: ""Is it right to ask 10 million seniors on Medicare Advantage for more than their share? Congress is proposing over $100 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says many seniors will see cuts in benefits.""
 
For this item, we're examining whether people in Medicare Advantage would give up ""more than their share"" because of health care reform.
 
First, some background about Medicare Advantage.

 

There are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage. They can enroll in traditional Medicare and a prescription drug plan through the government and maybe buy a supplemental policy to cover many of their out-of-pocket costs. Or they can enroll in Medicare Advantage programs (including a drug plan) that are run by private insurers. About 23 percent of people covered by Medicare are Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. They often receive more generous benefits, such as dental and vision coverage, or gym memberships. Some plans pay the patient’s monthly Medicare premium, which can amount to about $100.

 

The reason Medicare Advantage plans are more generous is that they usually receive higher reimbursement rates from the federal government. Ironically, Medicare Advantage was initially conceived as a way of lowering Medicare costs through competition. But in the complicated way the program is structured, things have turned out differently.

 

Today, Medicare Advantage costs taxpayers about 14 percent more per capita than traditional Medicare — a financial burden borne both by traditional Medicare beneficiaries (through their Medicare premiums, which are deducted from their Social Security checks) and by taxpayers generally (through payroll deductions earmarked for Medicare). Currently, everyone in Medicare — both traditional and Medicare Advantage — pays an extra $3 per month to cover the higher costs of Medicare Advantage.

    

The bills working their way through Congress would change this system, equalizing what the government pays for Medicare and Medicare Advantage. That's where the savings referenced in the AHIP ad come in.

 

The second and third sentences of the ad — about funding cuts to Medicare Advantage and the CBO saying that many seniors will see fewer benefits — appear to be correct. CBO has estimated that under the Senate Finance Committee's original bill the cuts to Medicare Advantage would total $117 billion between 2010 and 2019. And CBO estimated that the original House bill would cut the program by $156 billion over the same period. That's clearly ""over $100 billion"" in cuts.

 

Meanwhile, the ad is correct that CBO — or, more precisely, CBO's director, Douglas Elmendorf — said that these funding cuts would result in benefit cuts to seniors. ""They would not receive as much additional benefits [as they do] in the current Medicare Advantage system,"" Elmendorf testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Sept. 22, 2009. Most experts we contacted agreed with Elmendorf that some benefits for Medicare Advantage participants would likely be cut if the new funding rules are enacted.

 

It should be noted, however, that these cuts would not reduce the basic package of Medicare benefits that Medicare Advantage providers must offer. Rather, the cuts will come from the extra benefits that Medicare Advantage providers typically offer their patients, using the extra government money they get. The specific mix of cuts would be determined by the insurer, not by the bill.

 

In fact, the existence of Medicare Advantage's extra layer of benefits complicates the task of determining whether the first sentence of AHIP's ad — ""Is it right to ask 10 million seniors on Medicare Advantage for more than their share?"" — frames the issue accurately.

 

The implication that Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are losing more than their share ""is not accurate,"" said Stuart Guterman, a Medicare expert at the Commonwealth Fund, which studies health care policy. ""I think there's no doubt there will be cuts in benefits for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. But they've been getting more than their share up to now.""

 

""We think it is misleading,"" agreed Marc Steinberg, deputy director of health policy for Families USA, a group that supports health care reform. ""There's no mention of the 30 million-plus seniors who don't benefit from Medicare Advantage, but whose premiums are higher in order to subsidize the program, or the taxpayers who subsidize it.""

 

Robert Moffit, who directs the Center for Health Policy Studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, is generally positive about Medicare Advantage, writing in a recent paper, ""Medicare Advantage provides seniors with choice, variety, and value."" But even he has problems with the way AHIP worded the first sentence of the ad. ""I don't know what the question means,"" he told PolitiFact. ""I frankly think it's a vague sentence.""

 

Ultimately, AHIP's ad correctly communicates the facts about the size of the proposed Medicare Advantage cuts and their effect on beneficiaries. But the trade group spins these facts to their advantage and leaves out important context. The ad does not specify that cuts to Medicare Advantage would be made to extra benefits provided by insurers under Medicare Advantage, not to core benefits, which will remain untouched. In addition, it says that Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are taking a hit that's ""more than their share"" — an assertion that glosses over the fact that the government is currently paying 14 percent more for their coverage than it does for beneficiaries of traditional Medicare. We rate the statement Half True.

Flexible spending accounts under health care reform might get new limits
","
As Congress considers a sweeping health care reform bill, groups are springing up that represent obscure aspects of the current system.
 
The latest group raising concerns represents companies that provide flexible spending accounts. The group, known as Save Flexible Spending Plans, sent us a press release with the dire warning that a proposal approved by the Senate Finance Committee ""would drastically restrict the use of flexible spending accounts (FSAs) in order to help pay for health care reform.""
 
""FSAs are a lifeline for working Americans, often making the difference between staying afloat and going into debt over health care needs, and sometimes between getting necessary treatment and avoiding it altogether because of the cost,"" said Joe Jackson, the organization's chairman and CEO of the benefits company WageWorks.
 
To be clear, the group represents companies that would lose out if FSAs went away. We're examining the group's claim about the impact of the health care bill authored by Sen. Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who chairs the Finance Committee.
 
For the uninitiated, flexible spending accounts are benefits that some employers offer. Here's how they work: You agree to send a portion of your paycheck to a flexible spending account that can be used for health care costs. You get those dollars tax-free, so you save money by avoiding Uncle Sam's taxes.
 
The accounts have several restrictions. Employers can limit how much money you can save; typical limits are anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 (though some employers set no limit). You have to save all your receipts and submit them to an administrator in most cases. And if you have any money in the account at the end of the year, your employer gets to keep it. Because of the use-it-or-lose-it provision, people tend to use these accounts for predictable health expenses, not emergencies.
 
People who have the plans find them a good way to pay for co-pays, dental care, or special procedures that can be scheduled to match their contributions. People with more serious illnesses who have predictable costs also benefit significantly.
 
Policymakers tend to dislike flexible spending accounts. According to this view, they unnecessarily complicate the tax code, and the use-it-or-lose-it provision encourages people to spend money on health care they don't really need. Because income taxes are progressive, the benefits of saving in an FSA go to higher earners and are negligible for people with low income.
 
The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning public-policy think tank, published a paper in June saying that health care reform should

curtail flexible spending accounts

. That would increase tax revenues to the federal government, which could be used to pay for subsidies for the uninsured.
 
""The average FSA benefit is a few hundred bucks,"" said Chuck Marr, the center's director of federal tax policy. He said that's small potatoes and that Congress should focus more a sweeping reform bill. ""In a world where resources are limited, this bill is trying to give coverage to people who don't have any.""
 
We checked Baucus' bill, which passed the committee on Tuesday. It does limit flexible spending accounts to $2,500 a year. It does not index them for inflation, which means that $2,500 will have less buying power as the years go by.
 
Getting back to our statement, the organization Save Flexible Spending Plans said the Senate Finance Committee ""would drastically restrict the use of flexible spending accounts (FSAs) in order to help pay for health care reform."" Yes, it would restrict them, but even Save Flexible Spending Plans says the new restriction would affect only ""one in five"" beneficiaries. So this means by the group's own accounting that 80 percent of the people with FSAs would not be affected. That hardly seems drastic. We rate the group's statement Half True.

"['Population', 'Virginia', 'Denver Riggleman']","
Was more than half of Virginia's legislature born out of state?
","U.S. Rep. Denver Riggleman, R-5th, recently accused the newly-elected Democratic majority in the General Assembly of embracing liberal policies that are out of sync with Virginia. Democrats last fall won control of both legislative chambers for the first time this century. Riggleman, during a Jan. 23 radio interview on the John Fredericks Show, said the party has gone ""absolutely loco"" in passing gun control bills, proposing a gas tax hike to improve roads and backing measures he said will hurt small businesses.  He said Democrats could be facing the ""shortest tenure ever for a majority, based on the craziness coming out of the state legislature."" He added, ""Over 50% of the people now in the House and the state Senate have not been born in Virginia. And most of them, completely new. They’re not even Virginians by grace yet."" We fact-checked Riggleman’s statistic. We’ll leave it to you to determine what, if anything, qualifies a person to be a ""Virginian by grace."" The numbers To learn where lawmakers were born, we consulted their  biographies on the House and Senate websites and in General Assembly manuals. In a few cases, we turned to newspaper stories or asked legislative aides. The newly-elected House of Delegates sworn in last month has 52 members born outside Virginia and 48 born inside the state. The newly-elected Senate has 22 members born outside the state and 18 born within. Combining the chambers, 74 legislators were born outside Virginia, 66 inside. That’s a flip from 2019, when Republicans held narrow majorities in both chambers. In the House 52 delegates were born in Virginia, 48 weren’t. In the Senate, 22 were born in Virginia, 18 were not. Combing the chambers, 74 lawmakers were born inside Virginia, 66 outside. In other words, there was a net addition in both chambers of four members born outside the state. But these numbers are tricky and don’t suggest - as Riggleman implies - that those born outside Virginia are alien to its culture.  Nine current General Assembly members (six senators and three delegates) listed as being born out of state were delivered across the Potomac River in Washington D.C. Their biographies show six of them (four senators and two delegates) graduated from high school or college in Virginia. If counted, Riggleman’s claim about out-of-state majorities would fall.  Twelve other legislators were born in states bordering Virginia: North Carolina; Maryland; West Virginia; Kentucky; and Tennessee. Republican Del. Terry Kilgore, for example, has lived in Gate City in Southwest Virginia for all of his life, except when he attended college and law school in other parts of Virginia. But he was born in a hospital 20 miles away in Kingsport, Tenn. and - in Riggleman’s claim - doesn’t count as a native-born Virginian.  Demographics So far, we’ve been focusing on the details of numbers between 2019 and 2020 and, by strict count, there has been a transition to where a majority of General Assembly members were born out of Virginia. But a broader trend emerges if we use 1960 as our starting point. The increase in non-Virginia legislators over the past 60 years reflects the increase in non-native-born Virginians living in the state.  In 1960, Virginia was in the final years of domination by a political machine controlled by Democratic U.S. Sen. Harry Byrd that was rural in origin and segregationist. The House of Delegates had 96 Democrats and four Republicans; the Senate had 38 Democrats and two Republicans. Eighty-five percent of the legislators were born in Virginia, as was 71% of the state’s population. These days, Virginia’s politics are dominated by a suburban crescent arching from Northern Virginia through Hampton Roads. There’s been a large migration to the state through these suburbs - particularly Northern Virginia - by a professional class of government workers and contractors. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 50.5% of the state’s population in 2018 was born outside Virginia. That nearly matches the 52% of legislators this year who were not born in Virginia. ""People like to vote for people who reflect them,"" said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist. ""These legislators reflect the people they represent. Riggleman’s living in the past."" ""We’ve become a different state,"" said Bob Holsworth, a political scientist and consultant. ""I certainly understand some people who regret that some of the traditions have gone by, but in terms of overall prospects (offered by Virginia), there’s a big difference between now and 65 years ago."" By the way Although it’s not part of fact-check rating, we took a quick look at  Riggleman’s contention that most of the out-of-state legislators were elected last year. He’s wrong. Only nine of the 52 non-Virginia born delegates were elected last fall, as were only five of the 22 senators born out of state. Our ruling Riggleman says, ""Over 50% of the people now in the House and state Senate have not been born in Virginia."" Fifty-two delegates in the 100-member House were born outside of Virginia; so were 22 members of the 40-seat Senate. We have trouble with Riggleman’s implication that those born outside Virginia are out of step with the state. Many born outside the state grew up and were educated in Virginia. Moreover, the 52% percent of lawmakers born in other places nearly matches the 50.5% of Virginia citizens born elsewhere. The numbers reflect Virginia’s diversity But the raw statistic Riggleman cites is correct, and we rate his statement True.  ",/factchecks/2020/feb/12/denver-riggleman/was-more-half-virginias-legislature-born-out-state/
"['Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Tony Evers']","
Evers exaggerates progress on tax cut pledge
","Gov. Tony Evers has run into a Republican buzzsaw in attempting to get many of his policies through the state Legislature. But he still identified plenty of progress to celebrate in his latest State of the State speech. He touted changes in education, transportation and healthcare, then circled back to an earlier pledge on taxes. ""I delivered on my campaign promise for a 10% tax cut for Wisconsin families,"" he said Jan. 22, 2020, in the annual address. We’ll need to look back at his promise and forward at tax projections to see if that’s the case. Here we go. Evers’ speech didn’t go into much detail on the nature of that tax cut, but he was quite specific in 2018 on the campaign trail. A news release from his campaign on Oct. 14, 2018, described it this way: Under Evers’ plan, everyone with annual incomes up to $100,000 would receive a 10% tax cut. Evers would also provide the tax cut to families making up to $150,000. Altogether, this cut would reach approximately 86% of tax filers. That news release remained on Evers’ campaign website as of late 2019 but has been removed. A copy is still accessible through archive.org. Regardless, that gives us a firm benchmark to examine Evers’ claim that he ""delivered"" on that promise. When asked for evidence of Evers’ claim, spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff pointed to Wisconsin Department of Revenue projections for the 2020 tax year. The agency generated projected tax impacts for each income bracket based on the policies written into law through the budget and an accompanying bill (Acts 9 and 10).  Department of Revenue spokeswoman Patty Mayers noted these are estimates that can change, but they are the best existing projections for the tax changes passed under Evers. Baldauff highlighted estimates for married filers with incomes between $30,000 and $60,000. Each of the three income brackets in that range are projected to see tax cuts of 10% or more. But Evers promised a tax cut to all families with an income of $150,000 or less, and the full Department of Revenue projections show tax brackets under and over that amount fell well short of that 10% mark. Across all income brackets under $150,000, the changes from Acts 9 and 10 generate an average tax cut of 4.9% for married filers who owe taxes — half of what Evers promised. That works out to about $129 per tax return. If you look at the impact in terms of people, about one-fourth of married filers will see the promised cut of 10% or more, according to the Department of Revenue projections. That’s among the group that owe some amount of taxes and fall in the under-$150,000 bracket Evers referenced.  Baldauff asserted Evers always intended to focus his 10% tax cut on ""middle-class"" families, meaning the 10% tax cut in the $30,000 to $60,000 fulfilled his promise. But neither his original pledge nor his wording in the State of the State reflected that.  In any case, the definition of middle-class offered by Baldauff doesn’t make much sense in a state where the median family income is about $59,000. Her range only goes down from the median, not up. We should also note that we’ve visited this topic before with our Evers-O-Meter, which tracks promises Evers made while seeking the state’s highest office. In July 2019, we rated a promise to cut middle class taxes by 10% as a Compromise, since initial projections showed Evers’ proposed tax break was cut roughly in half by the Republican Legislature. That’s in line with the updated projections. We focused on married filers since Evers’ speech referred to families, but we should note he also promised a 10% tax cut to ""everyone"" filing an individual tax return with an income of $100,000 or less. The latest projections for single filers show a similar trend to the married filers in 2020. Those with incomes of $20,000 to $40,000 are expected to see a tax cut of more than 10%, but the reduction is noticeably less for the income brackets above and below that. Overall, single filers with incomes below $100,000 are projected to see an average tax cut of 6.7% under Acts 9 and 10. Evers said he ""delivered"" on his promise of a 10% tax cut for Wisconsin families. But his October 2018 promise said all married filers with an income under $150,000 would see a 10% tax cut. And that’s not what happened. The final changes passed into law will yield a 10% tax cut for only about one-fourth of that group, according to the latest projections. On average that sub-$150,000 group will see a tax cut of 4.9%. Only married filers with incomes between $30,000 and $60,000 are expected to see an average cut of 10% of more. In other words, there’s an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Which is our definition of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/feb/12/tony-evers/evers-exaggerates-progress-tax-cut-pledge/

Far-right radio host Hal Turner promotes unproven coronavirus bioweapon conspiracy
","A far-right radio host who has supported the rhetoric of white supremacy is spreading misinformation about the origins of the coronavirus outbreak. In an article published Feb. 1, the Hal Turner Radio Show wrote that the 2019 coronavirus is ""a military bioweapon developed by China’s army"" at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. As evidence, it points to two screenshots from a national database of genetic material. ""Somehow, it got out. The world is now facing a massive wipe-out of humanity as a result,"" the article reads. ""The proof that this virus is a genetically-modified Bat-SARS-Like Virus, manipulated by the Chinese Army, appears below. The evidence is irrefutable."" The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 2,000 times. (Screenshot from Hal Turner Radio Show) Since its December outbreak in Wuhan, China, the coronavirus has spread rapidly around the world. According to the World Health Organization, more than 40,000 people have been infected in 24 countries. In China, 909 have died. PolitiFact has fact-checked several conspiracy theories about the source of the coronavirus. Some hoaxes suggested that the virus somehow escaped from the Wuhan lab, which deals with some of the world’s most dangerous pathogens, such as Ebola and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.  We have found no evidence to back up those claims — and the Hal Turner article is similarly flawed. The Hal Turner Radio Show claims that, because two coronavirus entries in a federal database have similar proteins, they are the same virus. That’s unproven. Hal Turner uses internet and radio broadcasts to float conspiracy theories and hate speech. In 2010, he was sentenced to 33 months in prison for threatening three federal judges over their decision to uphold handgun bans in Chicago. The Hal Turner article cites screenshots of two GenBank entries for coronavirus proteins. GenBank is a database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information that lists publicly available DNA sequences. The first screenshot shows an entry for an envelope protein for a ""Bat SARS-like coronavirus"" that was submitted in 2018 by the Institute of Military Medicine, Nanjing Command. According to the Universal Protein Resource, an envelope protein is a membrane that ""forms the outermost layer"" of the complete, infective form of certain viruses. The second screenshot is an entry for another envelope protein associated with the ""Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus."" It was submitted Jan. 5 by the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and School of Public Health at Fudan University. RELATED: PolitiFact’s coronavirus coverage in one place The Hal Turner Radio Show compared the two viral proteins using a NCBI search and found that the two were nearly identical. But there are seven kinds of coronaviruses that can infect humans and they have similar envelope proteins. So the match doesn’t prove the two viruses are the same. ""The family of coronaviruses are going to be highly related, just because they are in the same family,"" said Richard Watanabe, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of California’s Keck School of Medicine, in an email. We ran the same NCBI search as the Hal Turner Radio Show and found 78 entries with envelope proteins similar to the 2019 coronavirus. The second claim in the Hal Turner Radio Show’s article is that, since Chinese researchers uploaded its genetic information, the 2019 coronavirus is a military bioweapon. That’s unproven. There is a lab near Wuhan that deals with dangerous pathogens — and some have linked it to China’s biological warfare program. The country denies having such a program, but the U.S. State Department has raised concerns about China’s potential noncompliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, which bans the production of such weapons. Officials are still working to determine the source of the coronavirus outbreak. In its most recent situation summary, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that both it and Chinese authorities had isolated the genome of the 2019 coronavirus. Their findings suggest ""a likely single, recent emergence from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus."" The disease appears to have originated at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, and it spread from there to 24 countries. Researchers believe the current outbreak pattern suggests the coronavirus may have spread from animal to human at first, and now from human to human. RELATED: No evidence that Chinese officials will say coronavirus was leaked from a lab There’s no evidence that the coronavirus was developed as a bioweapon. And even if there were, Watanabe said it’s highly unlikely the Chinese military would have uploaded the genetic sequence to a public database maintained by an American government agency. ""China, like the other countries including the U.S., have legitimate biomedical research going on at military facilities,"" Watanabe said. ""Just because they uploaded information, doesn’t make it a bioweapon."" The Hal Turner Radio Show claimed the coronavirus is ""a MILITARY BIO-WEAPON Developed by China's Army."" As evidence, the website included two screenshots of coronavirus entries in a federal database of genetic material. The site claimed the two viruses are the same. But all human coronaviruses have similar genetic material, and just because the entries were uploaded by Chinese researchers doesn’t prove that the 2019 coronavirus was developed as a bioweapon.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Trump did accept African Americans and Jews at Mar-a-Lago at a time when most private clubs in Palm Beach, Fla., were not open to them.  But it was a business move, not a crusade, and he did not sue in court to do so. Here’s what happened, based on reports from the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, Vanity Fair and other media. Mar-a-Lago (in Spanish, sea-to-lake) was a mansion built by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post in 1927. Trump bought the 128-room, 20-acre estate and its furnishings in 1985, for $9 million.  Trump used Mar-a-Lago as a private residence until 1995, when he turned it into a private club, open to anyone who could afford the $100,000 initiation fee. That made his club different from other Palm Beach clubs (only one was open to Jews). Trump’s club was the first to accept African Americans and openly gay couples, according to the Washington Post. Trump lawyer Paul Rampell eventually persuaded Trump of the business value of wider membership by arguing that Palm Beach had many Jewish residents but they had no real club of their own, Laurence Leamer wrote in his book, ""Mar-a-Lago: Inside the Gates of Power at Donald Trump’s Presidential Palace."" So, what about a lawsuit? Before making Mar-a-Lago a private club, Trump originally wanted to subdivide the land and sell mansions on it. After a year of meetings and hearings, the Palm Beach Town Council voted down the project.  After Trump sued the town for $50 million, the town approved the club (the lawsuit was settled), but with restrictions to limit traffic and noise. Trump didn’t invoke African Americans and Jews until he tried to get those restrictions lifted. In December 1996, when the town council refused, he sued, alleging that the town was discriminating against Mar-a-Lago, in part because it was open to Jews and African Americans. The town denied the allegation, saying it was merely deciding a zoning matter. In any case, the lawsuit was not about opening the club to Jews and African Americans; it was already open to them.  
A Facebook post claims: ""Donald Trump sued the City of Palm Beach when he bought a segregated club, Mar A Lago, to open it to Jews & Blacks."" Trump used Mar-a-Lago for a private residence for a decade before opening it as a private club. He was a pioneer, of sorts, in Palm Beach by opening it to Jewish people and African Americans. But he did so on his own, for business reasons, and he didn’t have to go to court.

Trump mostly wrong about NC Republicans as underdogs
","After his impeachment acquittal last week, President Donald Trump reminded Republicans of his importance to their success. Trump said during a press conference on Thursday that, with his help, Republicans could take back the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. ""You know, in ’18, we didn’t win. We just won two seats in North Carolina, two wonderful seats in North Carolina, that were not supposed to be won,"" he said. A video of his speech is available on C-SPAN’s website.  Trump continued: ""But I went and I made speeches and we had rallies, and we did a great job and we won, and we took two seats. Nobody writes about that. If we lost them, it would have been the biggest story of the year."" Trump didn’t mention any other details about the races during his speech, but it’s clear from context that he was referring to North Carolina’s recent special elections. North Carolina last year held elections for two congressional seats: one in the 3rd District and the other in the 9th District.  This isn’t the first time Trump has boasted about his supposed influence on the 9th District race. Last year, Trump claimed that the Republican in the 9th District race, Dan Bishop, was ""down by 17"" points in the polls and then won ""by a lot."" But the polls didn’t support that statement and the final margin of the race was only 2 points, so PolitiFact rated his claim False. Trump’s claim on Thursday was a little different. He referred to both races, and was speaking more generally about who was expected to win. So is it true that Republicans were underdogs in those races?  No. Let’s look at the races, one by one. The 9th District race featured Bishop and Democrat Dan McCready.  Background: The election was a do-over of the November 2018 contest, when Republican Mark Harris appeared to defeat McCready. But an investigation into the results found absentee ballot fraud, and the alleged leader of the ballot scheme worked for the Harris campaign. So the State Board of Elections called a new election, and Harris dropped out. About the district: The 9th District was home to more registered Democrats than Republicans, said Michael Bitzer, a history and politics professor at Catawba College. About 36 percent of registered voters are Democrats, 32 percent are unaffiliated and 31 percent are Republicans. But that doesn’t mean the district favored Democrats. ""While it may seem that party registration favored Democrats, a significant portion of those registered Democrats are in rural counties, which means that they are more likely to be Republican voters,"" Bitzer said. Indeed, no Democrat had won the seat since 1963, according to the Charlotte Observer. ""Polls showed a tight race due to the Democratic-leaning national environment and Dan McCready's strength as a candidate,"" said Drew Savicki, a freelance political analyst who has written for the Sabato’s Crystal Ball political blog. But, Savicki added: Trump in 2016 won the district by 12 points, and ""Democrats only hold a few seats redder than that."" Polls and predictions: It’s true that some polls showed McCready with a lead. But some polls showed Bishop with a lead. The website FiveThirtyEight tracked some of the polling of the district. As we’ve previously reported, the most favorable public poll for McCready had him up 5 points and most favorable poll for Bishop showed him up 4 points. Most experts considered the Democrat’s chance to be 50-50, at best. Kyle Kondik of Sabato’s Crystal Ball considered the race a ""toss-up,"" while Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report wrote that a McCready win would be ""an upset."" The 3rd District race featured Republican Greg Murphy and Democrat Allen Thomas -- and wasn’t nearly as close as the 9th District race. Background: The special election was ordered after the death of longtime Congressman Walter Jones, a Republican. He had represented the district for more than 24 years.   About the district: Voter registration favored Republicans, who had 34 percent of the population to the Democrats’ 32 percent, Bitzer said. In 2016, Jones won with 67 percent of the vote, and Trump carried the district by 23 percent. So the race between Thomas and Murphy wasn’t considered competitive. ""No version of the 3rd district has backed a Democrat for President since Carter in 1980,"" Savicki said. Polls and predictions: The only poll documented on FiveThirtyEight showed Murphy up by 11 percent.  Sabato’s blog said the race leaned Republican. And Bitzer said in an email: ""I can’t recall any handicapper or political analyst ever thinking that the NC 3rd was in danger of going to Democratic."" PolitiFact reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign about his claim, but didn’t hear back.  ""To say that Republicans were not likely to win either of those seats makes it sound like analysts had both seats rated as Democratic-likely elections,"" Bitzer said. ""To my knowledge, there was no data or polling that would have indicated that scenario."" Trump said Republicans ""just won two seats in North Carolina ... that were not supposed to be won."" In 2019, Republicans Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy won their respective special elections. But neither was considered an underdog. Some polls showed Bishop trailing McCready, and there are more registered Democrats than Republicans in that district. But it’s a stretch to suggest the Democrat was expected to win.

Fact-checking how many Trump relatives and friends are in the White House, administration
","President Donald Trump and his Republican allies have attacked former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter for riding his family name to a fortune in Ukraine. But a viral post floating around social media suggests the same charges should be thrown in Trump’s direction. The picture, a spin-off of a 2016 cartoon showing Trump hoarding bags of cash, tags Trump’s daughter Ivanka, her husband Jared Kushner, and the children of Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr as benefactors of Trump’s presidency. ""Trump’s daughter works at the White House,"" the text says. ""Her husband works at the White House. Rudy’s son works at the White House. Barr’s son-in-law works at the White House. Barr’s daughter works at Treasury. Trump’s sons do foreign business. Trump’s daughter is getting Chinese patents and Saudi grants. But sure, let’s talk about Hunter Biden."" The image has been circulating on Facebook and Twitter since at least early December, when the House was moving toward impeaching Trump after a whistleblower complaint sounded alarms about Trump’s efforts to get Ukraine to announce an investigation into the Bidens.  One post from Occupy Democrats, a liberal advocacy group, received over 22,000 likes and more than 23,000 shares on Facebook. Actor John Leguizamo also shared the image. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We decided to break down the family claims one by one. Trump, Barr and Giuliani all have family members working in top positions at the White House and other government agencies, according to LinkedIn, news reports and the White House’s latest annual report to Congress on its personnel. Here’s what we found: • Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump’s daughter, works as an adviser to the president and makes no salary. • Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump’s husband, works as an assistant and senior adviser to the president. He also takes no salary. • Andrew Giuliani, Giuliani’s son, works as a special assistant to the president and associate director of the office of public liaison. He’s paid $95,000 per year.  • Tyler McGaughey, Barr’s son-in-law, works as an associate in the White House counsel’s office with an annual salary of $125,792. • Mary Daly, Barr’s daughter, works as a senior adviser to the director of the Treasury Department’s financial crimes unit, according to news reports and her LinkedIn profile. Ivanka Trump and Kushner have had White House roles since the early months of Donald Trump’s presidency, with Ivanka Trump formally occupying her position in March 2017 and Kushner swearing in just days after Trump’s inauguration.  Kushner’s appointment came after the Justice Department wrote a memo concluding that the White House was exempt from violating federal anti-nepotism laws. Andrew Giuliani, a former Trump campaign volunteer, was first appointed in March 2017, with a starting salary of $77,000, per the White House’s 2017 report.  Andrew Giuliani and his former girlfriend, Olympic figure skater Sarah Hughes, at the world premiere of 'The Other Guys' in New York on Monday, Aug. 2, 2010. (AP/Agostini) McGaughey, who’s married to Barr’s youngest daughter, and Daly, Barr’s oldest daughter, separately transitioned out of Justice Department jobs as Barr awaited Senate confirmation on his nomination to take over as attorney general, according to CNN.  Mary Daly poses for photographs at the Department of Justice in Washington on April 6, 2018. (AP/Ceneta) Other administrations, including under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, have seen relatives of high-ranking party leaders and administration officials in government positions.  The image also takes aim at Eric and Donald Trump Jr. for their management of the Trump Organization, as well as at Ivanka Trump for her own business interests. In October 2019, Eric Trump said, ""When my father became commander in chief of this country, we got out of all international business."" We rated that claim Pants on Fire. When Donald Trump became president, he transferred ownership of the Trump Organization to his sons and pledged that ""no new deals"" would be done during his time in office. But as we’ve documented, the Trump sons have put almost no stops to their overseas business dealings. They have traveled the globe, managing properties and moving on deals they insist were signed or in-the-works before their father moved into the White House.  Multiple news outlets and accountability groups have kept track of their international activities, and in some cases, the Trump children have publicly celebrated their endeavors.  Congratulations to our extraordinary @TrumpScotland team! Minutes ago, we received full & total approval for a new phase of development to include 500 homes, 50 cottages, sports center, retail & more. We also received approval to build a 2nd golf course! Very proud of them! pic.twitter.com/odVxomGdmf As for Ivanka Trump, it’s misleading to say she’s ""getting Chinese patents and Saudi grants."" The president’s daughter kept her international fashion business going for 18 months after her father’s election before shutting it down. Amid trade talks with China in 2018, she received a number of trademarks from the country related to her products. She added more in 2019, as well. Trademarks are slightly different from patents. According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, a trademark protects a symbol, logo, design, name or word meant to identify the person or company behind a product, while a patent protects a person or company’s new invention. In May 2017, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced their pledge to contribute $100 million to a World Bank fund meant to help women entrepreneurs and small-business owners around the world, according to reports. The fund was Ivanka Trump’s idea. But as Snopes noted, she does not have a hands-on role with the project, nor is she lining her pockets because of it. A viral image said: ""Trump’s daughter works at the White House. Her husband works at the White House. Rudy’s son works at the White House. Barr’s son-in-law works at the White House. Barr’s daughter works at Treasury. Trump’s sons do foreign business. Trump’s daughter is getting Chinese patents and Saudi grants."" The post gets the White House and government positions right, as well as the fact that the Trump sons are still conducting business internationally. Where it errs is in its portrait of the Saudi grants delivered to the World Bank for a project Ivanka Trump proposed. She does not stand to benefit from them financially.

Elizabeth Warren largely right about rivals' reliance on super PACs
","Sen. Elizabeth Warren took a shot at other candidates and out-of-control campaign spending during the debate before the New Hampshire primary.. ""Everyone on this stage except Amy (Klobuchar) and me is either a billionaire or is receiving help from PACs that can do unlimited spending,"" said Warren, D-Mass., Feb. 7. The question of who is funding the Democratic candidates is a longtime issue for Democratic primary voters. Warren’s assertion distanced her from billionaire candidates and from candidacies aided by donors who can give unlimited amounts. Warren is basically right about her rivals’ connection to unlimited political spending. However, we found that a different type of group is supporting her in similar ways. The terminology can be confusing, so let’s clarify the definitions. Political action committees, or PACs, are vehicles for politically active individuals to pool their money and spend it in political campaigns. There are dollar limits on how much individual donors can give to a PAC and how much PACs can spend on behalf of a given candidate.  A ""super PAC,"" by contrast, has fewer restrictions. Super PACs, which proliferated after the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Citizens United case, can raise and spend unlimited amounts, as long as they don't directly coordinate with candidates or party committees. Super PACs are often, though not always, established and run by a candidate’s former close aides. Super PACs, like regular PACs, publicly disclose their receipts and expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, though they sometimes get big donations from nonprofits, which don't have to disclose their donors. So tracking super PAC funding sources still leaves gaps. We’ll note that Warren didn’t say ""super PAC"" in her debate claim, but she clarified in a subsequent tweet that that’s what she was referring to. When we checked with the Warren campaign, they provided a list of candidates on the debate stage in New Hampshire. Warren’s list is essentially accurate:  Joe Biden: Unite the Country (super PAC) Pete Buttigieg: VoteVets Action Fund (super PAC) Bernie Sanders: National Nurses United super PAC, and Our Revolution Andrew Yang: Math PAC (super PAC) Tom Steyer: He’s a billionaire. No super PAC Amy Klobuchar: She’s neither a billionaire nor a super PAC beneficiary Yang and Biden both benefit from groups that were created specifically to support their campaigns.  Yang benefits from the Math PAC, a play on Yang’s catchphrase, which he says stands for ""Make America Think Harder."" The super PAC, founded by Democratic operative Will Hailer, reported spending $358,381 through Feb. 10. The pro-Biden Unite the Country super PAC, chaired by former Biden aide Mark Doyle, has spent almost $6.5 million, according to disclosures reported to the Federal Election Commission through Feb. 10. That includes extensive expenditures in the early primary and caucus states of New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, the Hill newspaper reported. The super PAC that supports Buttigieg is slightly different. VoteVets was established in 2006, when Buttigieg was still a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, rather than being purpose-built for his candidacy. Because VoteVets endorsed Buttigieg, a former Navy reservist, the group can use its super PAC on his behalf. It has purchased television advertising to support Buttigieg, the Washington Post reported. Sanders, meanwhile, benefits similarly from the super PAC affiliated with National Nurses United. Like VoteVets for Buttigieg, National Nurses United existed before Sanders’s presidential campaigns and has endorsed him.  Sanders also has the support of a different group, Our Revolution, that was created by Sanders aide Jeff Weaver and was headed for a period by former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, another Sanders ally. It isn’t a PAC or super PAC — it’s a 501(c)4 ""social welfare"" organization, which means that it is overseen by the Internal Revenue Service rather than the Federal Election Commission. But it has some similarities with super PACs. A 501(c)4 can accept unlimited donations, but it can’t allocate more than half of its spending toward political advocacy. And like super PACs, such groups do not have to disclose their biggest donors. (Our Revolution posts the names of donors, but not the amounts.) In addition, Our Revolution cannot formally coordinate with a candidate it supports. Our Revolution has also supported a variety of other candidates, not just Sanders. Warren has the support of an organization that’s affiliated with a 501(c)4 group, the same kind of group as Our Revolution. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee has backed Warren over her political career. Currently, the group has Warren in the first slot on the ""candidate"" page on its website.   While the Progressive Change Campaign Committee is not a super PAC, it is affiliated with the P Street Project, a 501(c)4 group. This means that Warren has the support of a group that, like a super PAC, can accept unlimited donations. It also doesn’t have to disclose its donors. Warren said, ""Everyone on this stage except Amy (Klobuchar) and me is either a billionaire or is receiving help from PACs that can do unlimited spending."" She has a point that Steyer is a billionaire and that Biden, Buttigieg, Sanders and Yang are each supported by a super PAC. Some of the super PACs started for the 2020 presidential campaign; some existed beforehand. That said, Warren has the backing of a group that has an affiliate organized under section 501(c)4 of the tax code, which allows it operate in much the same way as a super PAC does, even if it isn’t technically a super PAC. We rate the statement Mostly True. EDITOR'S NOTE, Feb. 19: By Feb. 19, both Warren and Klobuchar were benefiting from super PACs, according to news reports. Both candidates issued statements saying they do not want the help of these groups. As is our policy, our fact-check is made based on the situation at the time the claim was made, and so our rating does not change. EDITOR’S NOTE, Feb. 20: One day after our previous editor’s note, Warren changed her position on super PACs, saying that ""If all the candidates want to get rid of super PACs, count me in. I'll lead the charge. But that's how it has to be. It can't be the case that a bunch of people keep them and only one or two don’t.""",/factchecks/2020/feb/11/elizabeth-warren/elizabeth-warren-largely-right-about-rivals-relian/

Health misinformation site promotes conspiracy about coronavirus
","Editor’s note, May 17, 2021: When this fact-check was first published in February 2020, PolitiFact’s sources included researchers who asserted the SARS-CoV-2 virus could not have been manipulated. That assertion is now more widely disputed. Read our May 2021 report for more on the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19. That dispute notwithstanding, the assertion that ""the coronavirus was engineered by scientists in a lab"" is unsubstantiated and lacks evidence. We continue to rate the claim False.  As the 2019 coronavirus continues to spread around the world, an anti-vaccine website has concocted a conspiracy theory about its source. In a blog post published Feb. 3, Natural News, a website known to promote health misinformation, lays out an ""irrefutable"" conspiracy that the coronavirus is man-made. ""The tools for genetic insertion are still present as remnants in the genetic code. Since these unique gene sequences don’t occur by random chance, they’re proof that this virus was engineered by scientists in a lab,"" the story reads. The article goes on to say that the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are ""covering up this inconvenient fact in order to protect communist China."" Natural News does not provide evidence for the claim. The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 2,700 times. (Screenshot from Natural News) PolitiFact has fact-checked several hoaxes and conspiracies about the 2019 coronavirus, which has infected more than 37,000 people globally and killed 812 in China. The outbreak started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December and has since spread to 24 countries. One of the most popular conspiracies about the coronavirus is that it was created in a lab, possibly as a bioweapon. We’ve previously said those claims are unproven — and the Natural News story has similar shortcomings. The website says that ""every virology lab in the world that has run a genomic analysis of the coronavirus now knows that the coronavirus was engineered by human scientists."" But none of the researchers that has analyzed the virus has come to that conclusion. According to the CDC, both the agency and Chinese authorities have isolated the genome of the 2019 coronavirus. Their findings suggest ""a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir."" We analyzed the eight publications the CDC lists on its landing page about coronavirus. None asserts that the virus was engineered by humans. RELATED: PolitiFact’s coronavirus coverage in one place One study, which analyzed the genetic sequence of the coronavirus, was published Jan. 30 in the journal The Lancet. It says the 2019 coronavirus is a human betacoronavirus similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and likely comes from bats. ""Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans,"" the study reads.  Early reports on the virus focused on the fact that many patients were linked to the Wuhan market. That suggested animal-to-person spread, according to the CDC, but later, a growing number of patients reported not having any connection to the market. That suggested the coronavirus was spreading person-to-person. Other blogs and social media users have speculated that a lab near Wuhan could be the source of the virus. The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is a maximum-security biolab that deals with some of the world’s most dangerous pathogens, including Ebola and SARS. As of now, however, there is no evidence that the lab is the source of the outbreak. The Natural News article is unsupported by evidence.

Better than other plans or better than nothing? Trump’s claim about ‘affordable’ options
","In his wide-ranging State of the Union address, President Donald Trump returned to a favorite theme: the cost of health insurance. He cited the high cost of premiums for people who buy their coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces and said his administration has provided new, less costly coverage. ""I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60% less expensive and better,"" Trump told the lawmakers gathered at the Capitol. So we wondered, to which new alternatives was he referring? We reached out to the White House to ask. Spokesperson Adam Kennedy responded that the president was talking about short-term, limited-duration plans. But that got us thinking: Are they really less expensive and better? Or simply better than nothing?  They are not. As background, short-term insurance plans have been around for decades in various iterations and are generally considered a stopgap solution for people between jobs or attending school. They provide some protections, usually paying a percentage of hospital and doctor bills after the policyholder meets a deductible. But they’ve always been a bit controversial. Unlike the ACA plans now available, short-term plans can bar people with health conditions from enrolling or exclude coverage for specific conditions or treatments. They also offer fewer benefits — meaning they are not required to comply with the health law’s mandated essential benefits requirement. So, for example, they don’t have to cover prescription drugs, or mental health services or substance abuse treatment — and many don’t. In addition, they can set annual or lifetime caps on benefits. Almost all exclude maternity care. If a person develops a health condition during the coverage term, insurers can look through their medical records and, in some cases, retroactively cancel the plans — or refuse to renew the coverage at the end of the policy’s term. The Obama administration restricted these policies, which still cannot be sold on the ACA marketplaces and do not qualify for subsidies, to a maximum coverage period of 90 days, down from the 364 days that applied previously.   The Trump administration reversed that time-limit restriction in 2018 and built on it by allowing insurers to offer policies renewable for up to three years. Officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, said at the time that these short-term plans provide an alternative but aren’t a good fit for everyone. For instance, the Trump rules require the policies to carry a warning that they aren’t ""required to comply with federal requirements for health insurance."" They also state that consumers should ""check the policy carefully to make sure you understand what the policy does and doesn’t cover."" The White House pointed us toward a January 2019 report produced by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation as the source for the president’s assertion that these plans are 60% less expensive. It quickly becomes clear that the analysis is very wonky and complex. After all, it’s not easy to project what benefits insurers will include in short-term plans or what they will charge individuals, which can vary based on their health. Even the analysts called the estimating process ""challenging.""  When it came right down to it, they hedged: Short-term plans are likely cheaper than the lowest-cost ACA plan for some consumers, but more expensive for others. For example, people who get a federal tax credit to buy ACA-compliant insurance or those who are older or less healthy would likely pay more in premiums for a traditional short-term plan, the analysts said.  Conversely, those without subsidies, especially younger or healthier consumers, might pay as much as 60% less than they would for the lowest-cost plan through the ACA, the analysis concluded. Another study, not cited by the White House but done by the conservative Manhattan Institute, also listed caveats, but more robustly defended the plans as less expensive. Premiums for short-term plans are lower — in some cases, almost half the cost — of ACA plans, it concluded. But critics put these price tags in context. ""I don’t have a reason to suspect the 60% is wrong if they’re lining them up against ACA plans, but if you’re a health plan that doesn’t cover much, it’s easy enough to offer a cheap premium,"" said Sabrina Corlette, research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. The consensus is that the coverage short-term plans provide is not better than that of ACA plans. But it could be better than going without insurance entirely.    ""Why not throw another option out there?"" said Doug Badger, senior fellow at the conservative Galen Institute. ""You might say this plan isn’t as good as that plan, but we may both agree that having this one is better than nothing."" He said that should be a decision made by consumers, who can weigh the pros and cons: ""They know their circumstances and risk tolerance."". Still, it’s a gamble, as no one knows what health conditions might befall them. A plan that doesn’t cover prescription drugs may be fine the first month, but if a serious illness crops up, it suddenly has unexpected costs. Others also note that short-term plans may have wider networks of doctors and hospitals than some ACA plans, giving consumers more options. ""In Texas, for example, you cannot buy an ACA plan that covers MD Anderson,"" the cancer center of the University of Texas, said Brian Blase, CEO of Blase Policy Strategies. Blase has advised Trump on his health policy efforts. ""The only way you can have such a plan that includes MD Anderson — unless you have employer coverage — is in a short-term plan."" Again, nice to have a wide network. But there’s a conundrum. Someone with cancer — attracted to a network because it includes MD Anderson — would be rejected by most short-term plans. That ability to reject applicants — or seriously limit coverage of their preexisting conditions — helps keep premiums down. But those are also the main reasons experts say the plans are not better than those offered under the ACA, which bars such limits. A preexisting condition is often defined as anything treated — or for which a ""prudent person"" should have sought treatment — during the previous 12 months to five years, depending on the insurer. ""If you have high blood pressure and, while on one of these plans, you have a heart attack, the plan could say that was a preexisting condition,"" said Corlette. State regulation of such plans varies widely, as do the coverage benefits and limits offered by various insurers. Some have limits listed in the fine print. While short-term plans have been embraced by regulators in some states, nearly half of all states have moved to limit them to less than 12 months. Four — California, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York — have barred them altogether.   Those states cite concerns about the effect on ACA premiums and the risk that consumers could be left hanging by the more limited nature of the short-term plans.  Trump said these are new plans that are 60% cheaper and better. But short-terms plans are not a new idea. Just how much cheaper they are depends on a lot of factors, experts told us. And it’s very hard to examine them in an apples-to-apples comparison with ACA plans, which cover far more and are required to accept all applicants. Given the limitations of short-term plans, they’re not better than ACA plans for most people, because policyholders could face potentially significant financial risk — or find their treatment needs are not covered. They’re definitely not better for people who qualify for federal subsidies to buy ACA insurance, especially those at the lower end of that income range, where the subsidies are larger. That said, a short-term plan may be better than going without coverage at all, particularly for a young or otherwise healthy person, whose income is above subsidy limits. We rate this claim as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/feb/10/donald-trump/better-other-plans-or-better-nothing-trumps-claim-/

Meme spreads dubious theory about why Mitt Romney voted to convict
","After Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, joined all Senate Democrats in voting to convict President Donald Trump on an article of impeachment, he became a target of social media ire from Trump allies. One example is a Jan. 31 Facebook post by the Committee to Defend the President, a pro-Trump political action committee that says on its Facebook page, ""The Crooked Media has shown us time and time again that they can not be trusted, we will defend him!"" The post, which was shared about 8,000 times, features photographs of Romney and two former CIA officials, Joseph Cofer Black and John Brennan. It says: ""If you don’t know who the guy in the middle (Black) is, you had better get up to speed, and fast. Joseph Cofer Black is Romney’s national security advisor. He also currently sits on the board of Burisma holdings. JCB joined the CIA in 1974, and was the head of their counter-terrorism center during the 9/11 terror attacks. John Brennan was the CIA station chief in Saudi Arabia who approved the sketchy visas for the 9/11 attackers. He followed JCB as the head of CIA’s counter-terrorism. And this is just scratching the surface of their relationships."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that the post sprinkles a few facts — and a few erroneous assertions — into an unsupported claim. We’ll take the elements one by one. While Joseph Cofer Black has advised Romney in the past, he is not currently his ""national security advisor,"" Romney’s office confirmed. Black served as director of the CIA’s Counterterrorism Center from 1999 to 2002 and as U.S. ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism from 2002 to 2004. Since then, he’s worked in the private sector, including a stint as vice chairman of Blackwater, a controversial security contractor.  Black’s relationship with Romney came primarily during Romney’s two presidential campaigns. Black served as senior adviser for counterterrorism and national security on Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, then served as a special adviser for national security and foreign policy on Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. The 2012 campaign team assembled dozens of foreign policy experts from the party, as is typical for both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates.  This appears to be correct, according to the Ukranian energy company’s website. When we checked it on Feb. 7, 2020, Black was listed as a director of the company. (The company’s press office did not respond to an inquiry.)  In fact, at one point, Black served on the board at the same time as Hunter Biden — the son of former Vice President Joe Biden who became a target of President Donald Trump and whose service on Burisma’s board inspired the actions that led to Trump’s impeachment. Here’s an archived version of the company’s website in 2017, showing both Biden and Black.  In a news release about Black’s hiring in 2017, Black is quoted saying, ""I was impressed to learn that Burisma Group is the fastest-growing private gas producer in Central Europe. International projects where the Group is involved require a more thorough analysis and risk assessment, not only in terms of conventional risks — financial or political but also in terms of security."" That’s correct.  As the Daily Beast noted in 2012, then-CIA chief George Tenet wrote that after the 9/11 attacks, Black insisted on staying at his office with his staff in a relatively exposed area of the CIA headquarters, rather than moving to a safer location. ""Well, they could die,"" Tenet recalls telling Black about his staff. Black responded, ""Well sir, then they are just going to have to die."" This is false. First, the CIA does not handle visas — the State Department does. The congressionally authorized 9/11 report went into detail about how each of the plot participants secured their visas. ""Individual consular officers (were) involved with the adjudication of visas to the hijackers,"" the report said. Second, during the time that Brennan was posted in Saudi Arabia, only a few of the visas were granted to the plotters (and not all of the terrorists got their visas in Saudi Arabia). Shortly after the plot quietly went into motion in 1999, President George W. Bush tapped Brennan to serve as chief of staff to Tenet at CIA headquarters, so Brennan was in the United States for most of the time the attack’s planning was underway. He was named the CIA’s deputy executive director in 2001, serving through 2003. ""He never approved a single U.S. visa,"" said Nick Shapiro, a spokesman for Brennan. This is false, although similar names have tripped up some non-experts. Black was head of the CIA’s counter-terrorism center, commonly known as CTC, from 1999 to 2002. The center is a part of the CIA. Brennan, by contrast, was named by Bush as interim director of the National Counterterrorism Center, an inter-agency group under the umbrella of the Director of National Intelligence. Brennan served in the post from 2004 to 2005. This is ironic, since during the 2012 presidential campaign, Black was working on behalf of Romney, the Republican challenger, while Brennan was working in the administration of the incumbent, President Barack Obama. The 2012 Daily Beast article specifically pairs the two as combatants. Black, the article said, was Romney’s ""trusted man inside the intel community,"" while Brennan’s role for Obama in the administration was ""so powerful that many senior spies complain that Brennan is the de facto CIA chief."" (He would later be named CIA director by Obama.) ""I am not aware of any connection between Gov. Romney and John Brennan, nor can I imagine any, since Brennan was with Obama,"" Andrew Natsios, a professor at Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service, told PolitiFact. Natsios is also a former administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development who served on the same 2012 Romney advisory panel as Black did. That said, times have changed in the Trump era, as Brennan has praised Romney for his stance on impeachment.  In October, Brennan tweeted, ""How many other Republican Senators are ready to show the courage, integrity, & principled position of Senator Romney?  Thank you, Senator, for putting our Nation & our Constitution above party politics & the corrupt behavior of Donald Trump."" Foreign policy experts said it is unlikely that Romney was thinking of protecting an adviser from eight years ago when weighing one of the most important votes he would ever cast in the Senate. Romney laid out his reasoning for voting to convict in his widely noted Senate floor speech.  ""Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president’s counsel that a crime had been committed, the president’s insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit,"" Romney said. He continued: ""The grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the President committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a ""high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did."" The Committee to Defend the President did not respond to an inquiry for this article. A Facebook post says that Romney voted against convicting Trump because Burisma board member Joseph Cofer Black ""is Romney’s national security advisor"" and because of ties to Obama CIA director John Brennan. The meme mixes a few facts with several inaccuracies to make an unsupported assertion. Black was an advisor to Romney’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns, and according to Burisma’s website, he serves on the company’s board. However, we see no evidence that Black is still advising Romney eight years later, and the notion that Brennan is close to Romney is undermined by the fact that he was working for the Obama administration when Romney was trying to unseat Obama in the 2012 presidential race. All told, Romney’s public explanation about why he voted to convict in such an important case is clear and more plausible than a desire to protect an adviser from eight years ago. We rate the statement False. CLARIFICATION, Feb. 10, 2020: This article has been updated to clarify that Brennan was not working on Obama's 2012 campaign but was rather working for the Obama administration.",/factchecks/2020/feb/10/committee-defend-president/meme-spreads-dubious-theory-about-why-mitt-romney-/

Maxine Waters' remarks about Trump and Pence were about impeachment, not inciting violence
","A viral post on Facebook claims that U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters made a violence-inciting remark about President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. The image shows an image of the California Democrat standing at a podium. It attributes this quote to her, saying she said it Sept. 17, 2018: ""I say, we knock off Trump and then, go after Pence. We have the power."" Below the quote, the post says:  ""Yes, she actually said this and then blames President Trump for inciting violence. ""Worth repinning! Why isn’t she in jail??"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Waters was one of the earliest elected officials supporting impeachment of Trump, calling for it just a few months after he took office in January 2017. While she didn’t make this exact comment, it appears she did say something similar, but it was in the context of impeachment, not violence. Waters called for Trump’s impeachment during a September 2018 event of the National Newspaper Publishers Association, which represents African American-owned community newspapers. ""All I want for him and about him is to be impeached and get him out of the White House,"" she said, according to a Sept. 17, 2018 article by Fox News. It continues to say that Waters said she would ""go after"" Pence if Trump were to be removed from office. The article — like other websites that reported on the speech — embedded a YouTube video of her comments in the report. But that video is no longer available online. We searched Google and the Nexis news archives and found that the most extensive reporting about Waters’ address came from conservative websites. The American Mirror, a conservative blog by Kyle Olson, reported that after Waters said, ""All I want for him and about him is to be impeached and get him out of the White House!""she dismissed criticism that an ousted Trump would make Pence president. Then, according to the website: ""Knock off the first one, and then go after the second one,"" she said. ""We have the power. We have the numbers, but we’ve got to understand our power and we’ve got to use our power."" We reached out to the National Newspaper Publishers Association to see if we could get more information about exactly what Waters said, but the organization did not respond to our request for information. Waters has made similar statements, before and since. Each of them were also in the context of impeachment: Aug. 4, 2017: Interviewed on ""The View"" TV show, Waters had this exchange with co-host Joy Behar. Behar: ""Do you think Pence will be better than Trump if he were impeached?"" Waters: ""No. And when we finish with Trump we have to go and get Putin. He’s next."" Behar: ""Putin or Pence?""  Waters: ""Uh, Pence."" Oct. 20, 2017: Speaking at an event for homeless LGBTQ people in honor of a man named Ali Forney: ""Wow, what a moving evening this is. I'm sitting here listening, watching, absorbing, thinking about Ali even though I never met him. And with this kind of inspiration, I will go and take out Trump tonight."" (CNN published the quote based on a video that has since been removed from YouTube.) In an interview four days later, Waters rejected the idea that she was vowing harm to Trump: ""That's absolutely ridiculous ... that a 79-year-old grandmother who is a congresswoman and who has been in Congress and politics all these years doing any harm. The only harm I might be doing to the president is I want him impeached."" Sept. 8, 2018: Speaking at a Democratic club event: Referring to the ""highest office of the land,"" Waters said (starting at the 13:45 mark in the video): ""I wake up in the middle of the night and all I can think about is I am going to get him."" About a minute later, Waters told the group that ""leadership"" had asked her not to say the word ""impeachment"" anymore. ""And when they say that, I say ‘impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment,’"" she said to laughter.  Waters also said she was told that if Trump were impeached, Pence would be worse. ""And I said, look, one at a time. You knock one down and then we’ll be ready for Pence. We’ll get him, too. Waters’ office did not respond to our requests for information. A Facebook post claimed that Waters said in September 2018: ""I say, we knock off Trump and then, go after Pence. We have the power."" We found no record that Waters made this exact statement. However, Fox News reported that Waters said something similar about Trump: ""All I want for him and about him is to be impeached and get him out of the White House,"" and that she would ""go after"" Pence if Trump were to be removed from office. While Waters has repeatedly stated her intention to ""get"" Trump and/or Pence, it has been in the context of Congress exercising its power to impeach a president and not, as the viral post suggests, to advocate violence.  We rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2020/feb/10/viral-image/maxine-waters-remarks-about-trump-and-pence-were-a/

No, George Soros wasn’t a Nazi soldier
","A viral image purporting to link George Soros to Germany’s Nazi Party is picking up new steam on social media. But the photo of a young man wearing glasses and an SS uniform is not the billionaire Democratic donor, despite what some posts would have you believe. ""I give you George Soros,"" the text stamped over the image, which was originally posted to Facebook in 2016, says. ""A(n) SS in the National Socialist German Workers Party. Nazi Party. He served under Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler."" The post, which has been shared more than 22,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We’ve fact-checked a version of the same photo before, as have reporters at Snopes and the Associated Press. The photo isn’t fake or doctored, but it also doesn’t show Soros, despite what the text attached to it says. A quick reverse image search reveals that much. In reality, the photo is of Oskar Gröning, a former SS soldier who was sentenced to four years in prison in 2015 for being complicit in the murder of 300,000 people during the Holocaust.  A screenshot of a Facebook meme wrongly identifying Oskar Gröning as George Soros (PolitiFact). The sentence was handed down when Gröning, who died in 2018, was 94 years old. During the Holocaust, he was a corporal in Hitler’s Waffen SS, according to the New York Times’ obituary. Soros, on the other hand, survived the Holocaust. When the Nazis invaded Hungary, Soros’ father obtained a false identity for Soros and sent him to live with an agricultural official who passed him off as his Christian godson, according to the New York Times.

Viral post uses art photos as evidence of false claim that Chinese eat 'human soup'
","This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  These pictures are from a 20-year-old controversial work of performance art. The post links to an undated article on b4blaze.in, an India-based website that says its ""aim is to promote creative thoughts, Ideas online which are yet to be discovered and deserves recognition."" The article carries essentially the same headline as the post as well as more gruesome images that include a hand grasping what appears to be an infant by its arms and legs. The article attributes the claim to ""an email report received by The Seoul Times,"" and describes a town ""in the southern province of Canton (Guangdong)"" where ""Chinese folks there are enjoying baby herbal soup to increase overall health and stamina and the power of sexual performance in particular"" at a price tag of $4,000 U.S. This article also appears on the website of The Seoul Times, an English-language newspaper, under the heading ""Letters to the Editor."" But there is no evidence to back this claim. The photos with the post are from Chinese performance artist Zhu Yu. He staged a performance called ""Eating People"" at a Shanghai arts festival in 2000. The photos showed Zhu Yu appearing to eat a stillborn or aborted child. AFP Fact Check on Feb. 6 debunked another Facebook post that uses a photo from the exhibit. It also reported that images from the exhibit have been used in hoax reports about cannibalism in China.  What’s more, experts we spoke to described such cannibalism rumors as ridiculous and misguided. ""This sounds like complete bull----. And if it is true, I’ve certainly never heard of it,"" William Schutt wrote to us in an email. He is a professor of biology at Long Island University, research associate at the American Museum of Natural History and author of the 2017 book, ""Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History.""  He Bian, a China historian at Princeton University, was more direct: ""It’s misinformation at the most malign level,"" she said. ""Medical traditions in both Europe and China had records of consuming human body parts, ranging from hair, urine, to semi-magical use of human remains. It seems to me (the post) is a malicious manipulation of this fact to make a sweeping racist statement in the present tense, which is categorically false."" Fabio Lanza, a professor of modern Chinese history at the University of Arizona, agreed. ""Blood libel has a long and sordid history in China, one that does not seem to ever end,"" he said. A post circulating on social media said: ""Chinese people eat human baby soup to improve health."" Photos with the post are from an art exhibit in 2000.
