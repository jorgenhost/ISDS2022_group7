No proof Biden left Taliban $80B in weapons, or that he wants Americans’ pistols
","A popular take on Facebook is that the Biden administration, with its withdrawal from Afghanistan, in effect armed the Taliban and yet, wants to take handguns away from Americans.  ""The current regime that just gifted the Taliban with $80+ billion worth of military grade weapons wants your 9mm pistols,"" a viral image claims. ""THINK ABOUT IT."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim was made amid reports of the Taliban having seized U.S. attack planes, Black Hawk helicopters and other vehicles and equipment. But the United States has spent $88.6 billion in Afghanistan for providing security over the course of two decades, and only a fraction of it was for hardware — so there is no way that more than $80 billion in weaponry was left behind. Meanwhile, Biden has not called for banning traditional handguns such as pistols, much less made any statements about confiscating them. The recent U.S. involvement in Afghanistan followed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, against the U.S. The attacks had been enabled by al-Qaida’s use of Afghanistan as its base.  After the attacks, the U.S. teamed up with Afghan allies to oust the al-Qaida-aligned governing Taliban and, eventually, stand up what was intended to be a more inclusive government.  In August 2021, as U.S. troops left, the American-backed Afghan army and government collapsed within about two weeks from the start of a Taliban offensive, and the Taliban resumed control of the country. The U.S. has allocated $88.6 billion to the Defense Department for equipment, supplies, services, training and funding for salaries, as well as facility and infrastructure repair, renovation and construction for providing security in Afghanistan. That’s according to the latest quarterly report, released July 30, 2021, by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. That office was created by Congress to oversee the spending. As of June 30, 2021, there were 167 usable aircraft, including 23 A-29 attack planes and 33 UH-60 Black Hawk military helicopters in Afghanistan. But there has been no full accounting of how much aircraft or other military equipment was still there in mid-August, when the Taliban regained control. Defense expert John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, said ""very little"" of the $88.6 billion would have been spent on equipment. He estimated that the military equipment remaining is worth less than $10 billion, though virtually all of it could be considered under the category of weapons. As for the second part of the claim, which suggests Biden wants to confiscate 9-millimeter pistols, during the 2020 presidential campaign we rated False a statement by the NRA that Biden wants to ban 9-millimeter pistols. Biden had said people don’t need to own ""military-style weapons,"" including pistols with 9-millimeter bullets that can hold 10 or more rounds. He was talking about banning high-capacity magazines, not the gun itself. Biden’s gun policies don’t call for outlawing traditional handguns such as pistols. In July, we rated False a claim by House Republicans that Biden ""says he wants to ban handguns."" He wants to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. A viral image says the Biden administration ""gifted the Taliban with $80 billion-plus"" in  military-grade weapons and ""wants your 9mm pistols."" There has been no accounting of how much military equipment was left in Afghanistan after U.S. troops withdrew and the Taliban resumed control of the country. One expert says equipment left behind that could broadly be considered weapons is likely worth less than $10 billion. Biden has not called for taking away 9-millimeter pistols from Americans. We rate the post False.","[('Facebook, post, Aug. 17, 2021', 'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10159284145718249&set=a.431300228248&type=3'), ('Defense News, ""The Taliban have access to US military aircraft.

Biden, Harris questioned Trump not vaccines; they back some vaccine requirements
","One line of attack on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris over COVID-19 holds that they went from opposing vaccines during the 2020 presidential campaign, while Donald Trump was in office, to mandating them now. ""Biden & Kamala continuously questioned the vaccine during the campaign. Yet now they apparently love it so much they support Vaccine Cards & Forced Vaccinations,"" an Instagram post charges. ""Their position flipped flopped solely bc of who was in the White House, this is why we don’t trust those in power!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s not correct that Biden and Harris questioned COVID-19 vaccines. They said they did not trust Trump, and whether he would roll out the vaccines safely. The Biden administration supports requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for certain people, such as members of the military. Vaccines: We rated False a claim that Biden and Harris distrusted COVID-19 vaccines. They said they trusted public health experts, but questioned Trump’s trustworthiness, his ability to roll out the vaccines safely and the risk of political influence over vaccine development. Trump was publicly touting the promise of a rapidly developed COVID-19 vaccine as early as March 2020, when fears of a global pandemic were just beginning to flare, and said he was urging researchers working on the vaccine to ""speed it up."" Scientists and drug makers, meanwhile, were urging more caution on the timeline and said they were emphasizing safety and effectiveness over speed. Vaccine ""cards"": Biden addressed the issue at a press conference Aug. 3. Asked whether more cities and states should follow New York City in requiring proof of vaccination to enter places such as restaurants and gyms, Biden replied: ""I do."" Biden was also asked: ""Do you think that they should institute a vaccine passport-type system or some sort of verification to use public spaces?"" He replied: ""I don’t think they need to do that. I think they just need to give the authority of those restaurants or businesses to say, ‘In order to come in, you have to give proof that you’ve been vaccinated or you can’t come in.’"" Vaccinations: Biden is requiring federal workers and contractors to sign forms attesting that they have been vaccinated against COVID-19, or requiring them to submit to regular testing and other requirements. The Pentagon is requiring all members of the military to be vaccinated. The Department of Veterans Affairs is requiring 115,000 of its frontline health care workers to be vaccinated. On Aug. 18, Biden announced he will soon require employees in nursing homes that serve people who are on Medicare or Medicaid to be vaccinated, or the nursing homes will lose funding from those two programs.  We rated False a claim that Biden promoted ""mandatory vaccines for everybody"" in a March 11 speech. On July 30, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said there will be no nationwide mandate for Americans to get a COVID-19 vaccine. In his Aug. 18 remarks, Biden said: ""While I’m mindful that my authority at the federal level is limited, I’m going to continue to look for ways to keep people safe and increase vaccination rates.""  An Instagram post claims that Biden and Harris ""continuously questioned the vaccine during the campaign,"" but now ""they support vaccine cards and forced vaccinations."" Biden and Harris questioned whether Trump would roll out COVID-19 vaccines safely. They did not question the vaccines themselves. Biden says he supports requirements for showing proof of vaccination to enter certain places, but does not back vaccine passports. The Biden administration supports requiring some people, such as members of the military and VA hospital workers, to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The Instagram post contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Joe Biden’s full flop on messages about Afghanistan withdrawal
","President Joe Biden told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that it wouldn’t have been possible to get out of Afghanistan without ""chaos ensuing."" But that’s a different message from what he told Americans in the months leading up to the planned withdrawal. Biden’s public statements in April and July included no warnings of chaos and instead portrayed U.S. plans for withdrawal as progressing smoothly.  Biden’s shifting public messaging about whether withdrawal from Afghanistan would be chaotic  is now in the spotlight. We decided to see how Biden’s statements shifted over time. We put his statements on our Flip-O-Meter, in which we evaluate whether a politician has been consistent in their position, not whether any change in position makes for smart politics, which is a judgment call. ""It’s time for American troops to come home. … We’ll do it responsibly, deliberately, and safely. "" — Biden April 14, 2021 In remarks April 14, Biden said the U.S. couldn’t stay in Afghanistan forever, citing financial and human costs.  ""I have concluded that it’s time to end America’s longest war,"" Biden said. ""It’s time for American troops to come home."" Nothing in his remarks suggested that Biden thought chaos was imminent. He said he inherited the agreement from the Trump administration to withdraw by May, but that he would not make a hasty exit.  ""We’ll do it responsibly, deliberately, and safely. And we will do it in full coordination with our allies and partners, who now have more forces in Afghanistan than we do,"" Biden said. ""And the Taliban should know that if they attack us as we draw down, we will defend ourselves and our partners with all the tools at our disposal."" Biden acknowledged that the threat of terrorism in Afghanistan — as well as other places — remained a concern, but his remarks gave the impression that the U.S. was ready to act if needed. ""We’ll hold the Taliban accountable for its commitment not to allow any terrorists to threaten the United States or its allies from Afghan soil. The Afghan government has made that commitment to us as well. And we’ll focus our full attention on the threat we face today,"" Biden said.  He added that his administration would monitor and disrupt terrorist threats in Afghanistan. But he  said it was time to focus on other challenges as well, including competition from China, cyber threats, defeating the current pandemic and preparing for a future pandemic.  ""War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi-generational undertaking,"" Biden said. ""We were attacked. We went to war with clear goals. We achieved those objectives. Bin Laden is dead, and al Qaeda is degraded in Iraq — in Afghanistan. And it’s time to end the forever war.""  ""The drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way, prioritizing the safety of our troops as they depart."" — Biden, July 8, 2021 In remarks July 8, Biden portrayed the withdrawal set for the end of August as ""proceeding in a secure and orderly way"" and gave no indication that he expected chaos. He told reporters that a Taliban takeover was not inevitable. But he acknowledged the strength of the Taliban, saying that the Taliban was at its ""strongest militarily since 2001."" After his remarks, reporters suggested disarray would ensue when the U.S. withdrew. Biden rejected those arguments. Reporter: ""Is a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan now inevitable?"" Biden: ""No, it is not."" Reporter: ""Why? Biden: ""Because the Afghan troops have 300,000 well-equipped (forces) — as well-equipped as any army in the world — and an air force against something like 75,000 Taliban. It is not inevitable."" When a reporter asked Biden if he trusted the Taliban, he said: ""No. But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped, and more competent in terms of conducting war."" Reporter: ""Your own intelligence community has assessed that the Afghan government will likely collapse."" Biden: ""That is not true. … They did not reach that conclusion."" A White House spokesperson, Vedant Patel, said Biden alluded to security concerns in part of his answer to a question by a reporter, which was, ""So what is the level of confidence that they (the U.S. intelligence community) have that it will not collapse?""  Biden: ""The Afghan government and leadership have to come together. They clearly have the capacity to sustain the government in place. The question is: Will they generate the kind of cohesion to do it? It’s not a question of whether they have the capacity. They have the capacity. They have the forces. They have the equipment.The question is: Will they do it? ​"" So Biden put the onus on Afghan leaders, but he didn’t make a clear warning about chaos.  A reporter told Biden that the U.S. top general in Afghanistan, General Scott Miller, ""told ABC News the conditions are so concerning at this point that it could result in a civil war. So, if Kabul falls to the Taliban, what will the United States do about it?""  Biden acknowledged in his answer to the reporter that there could be problems, but suggested it wasn’t America’s problem. ""There’s a number of countries who have a grave concern about what’s going to happen in Afghanistan relative to their security,"" Biden said. ""The question is: How much of a threat to the United States of America and to our allies is whatever results in terms of a government or an agreement? That’s when that judgement will be made."" Biden said he saw no parallels between our withdrawal and Vietnam, although we found in August that were some similarities — and some differences. ""This did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated."" — Biden, Aug. 16, 2021 Biden’s brief remarks Aug. 14 didn’t indicate that he thought chaos would break out. But in remarks two days later he acknowledged that the situation on the ground surprised him. Biden said he stood behind his decision and that there was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces. ""That’s why we were still there. We were clear-eyed about the risks. We planned for every contingency,"" Biden said. ""But I always promised the American people that I will be straight with you. The truth is: This did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated. So what’s happened?  Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometimes without trying to fight."" Biden didn’t flat out say chaos was inevitable, but he suggested the same outcome would have happened no matter when the U.S. pulled out. ""The events we’re seeing now are sadly proof that no amount of military force would ever deliver a stable, united, and secure Afghanistan — as known in history as the ‘graveyard of empires,’"" Biden said. ""The idea that somehow there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens. I don't know how that happened."" — Biden, Aug. 18, 2021 In an Aug. 18 interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, Biden shifted his message to state that chaos was bound to break out. Stephanopoulos: ""Back in July, you said a Taliban takeover was highly unlikely. Was the intelligence wrong, or did you downplay it?"" Biden: ""I think there was no consensus. If you go back and look at the intelligence reports, they said that it's more likely to be sometime by the end of the year."" Biden then suggested chaos was inevitable. Biden: ""The idea that somehow there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens. I don't know how that happened."" Stephanopoulos: ""So for you, that was always priced into the decision?"" Biden: ""Yes. Now, exactly what happened is not priced in. ... Look, one of the things we didn't know is what the Taliban would do in terms of trying to keep people from getting out, what they would do. What are they doing now? They're cooperating, letting American citizens get out, American personnel get out, embassies get out, et cetera. But we're having some more difficulty in having those who helped us when we were in there"" leave the country. In his April speech, Biden said it was time to leave Afghanistan, and he did not make any statement to warn Americans that he thought withdrawal would lead to imminent chaos.  In remarks in July, Biden said the withdrawal planned for August was ""proceeding in a secure and orderly way"" and gave no indication that he expected chaos. He told reporters that a Taliban takeover was not inevitable. But after withdrawal in August, Biden said on ABC, ""The idea that somehow there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens."" That statement was very different from his earlier remarks in which he did not indicate to Americans that he thought chaos was part of the deal of withdrawing from Afghanistan We found that his shifting remarks on whether withdrawal from Afghanistan would be chaotic constitute a complete change in position: Full Flop.

Yes, 90% of Wisconsin’s roadways are maintained by local municipalities
","The $1.2 trillion infrastructure plan advocated by President Joe Biden promises funding for a host of improvements aimed at shoring up the nation’s bridges, water pipes, roads and more.   Major investments in the bipartisan package include $110 billion for roads and bridges, $39 billion for public transit and $66 billion for railways.  In a June 29, 2021 visit to La Crosse, Biden noted his visit fell on the 65th anniversary of President Dwight Eisenhower signing a bill that created the country's interstate highway system — the last infrastructure bill of the scope being considered.  ""It's time for us to write a new chapter in that story,"" Biden said.  On Aug. 10, 2021, the Senate voted 69-30 to approve an infrastructure plan crafted by a bipartisan group of senators. It is now awaiting action in the House.  Prior to the vote, in a July 5, 2021 interview on WISN’s ""UpFront,"" Wisconsin’s Secretary of Transportation-designee Craig Thompson urged support for the measure.  ""If we get more federal money, I think people will see simply the condition of the roads, both at the state and local levels, improve,"" Thompson said, arguing that under Gov. Tony Evers the state had slowed a trend of ""disinvestment and neglect"" of Wisconsin's roads.  ""I believe we have stopped the decline in the condition of our state highways,"" Thompson said. ""We've gotten more money to the locals. But we’ve got 115,000 miles of roads in this state and 90% is owned by the locals. They just have a lot of roadway and they’ve got a long way to go.""  That’s a lot of miles. Is Thompson accurate on the breakdown? Joel Nilsestuen, assistant deputy secretary at the Department of Transportation, pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a document ""Six Year Highway Improvement Program: 2021-2026.""  It included this note: Wisconsin has 115,674 miles of public roads, from Interstate freeways to city and village streets. This highway improvement program covers only the 11,745-mile state highway system which is administered and maintained by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT). The other 103,929 miles are improved and maintained by the cities, towns, counties and villages in which they are located. A side note: That measurement is of ""centerline miles,"" of the length of the roadways, not lane miles which take into account multiple lanes. By that measure, Dane County comes out on top, with 4,260.44, followed by Marathon County (3,389.19), Waukesha County (3,120.90) then Milwaukee County (3,047.94) and Marinette County (2,363.06). Curt Witynski, deputy executive director of the League of Wisconsin Municipalities, said the group supports the infrastructure plan and that he expects local governments to benefit from the measure through ""Funding for improving our transportation infrastructure, including bridges and streets, but also alternative transportation options, like bike paths and lanes.  Also, we anticipate benefits to our municipal bus systems.""  It is too early to say how much Wisconsin could be allocated from the new federal infrastructure measure, or what percentage will go to the state vs. local units of government. But that was not part of the claim. Thompson said ""we’ve got 115,000 miles of roads in this state and 90% is owned by the locals."" Wisconsin has 115,674 miles of public roads and maintains the 11,745-mile state highway system. The other 103,929 miles are maintained by local municipalities, or 89.846%.

Doctored Al Jazeera tweet makes claims about Taliban

The parents who are refusing to give their daughters to Taliban are being killed by Taliban fighters.""  An image in the tweet shows what looks like a bloodied woman yelling on the ground, surrounded by five men.  But it appears that this tweet was doctored.  And a Facebook post sharing the image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We searched for the purported post on Al Jazeera’s verified Twitter account for breaking news and found nothing. We also searched for it more broadly, because even if a tweet has been deleted, an echo of it will appear in Google search results. But there’s none — at least not from @AJENews.

Joe Biden overshoots on visas for Afghans who helped U.S.
","As Kabul is evacuated, the fate of the thousands of Afghans who helped American agencies, contractors and the U.S. military during the two decades of American intervention hangs in the balance. In an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, President Joe Biden said that despite the sudden collapse of the Afghan government, his administration had been moving quickly to get Afghan workers out of the country. Biden referred in the interview to ""SIVs,"" the special immigrant visas created in 2009 specifically to keep safe those who had helped the American mission in Afghanistan. ""We had already issued several thousand passports to the — the SIVs, the people — the translators when I came into office, before we had negotiated getting out at the end of August,"" Biden said in the Aug. 18 interview. The numbers the White House provided as evidence deal with Biden’s time in office, and they only partly back up Biden’s claim. The administration has issued special immigrant visas at an ever faster pace, and the total is over 5,000 since April. But that figure includes family members of the people who worked with the U.S., and Biden’s comments don’t address an estimated 18,000 Afghan workers whose applications are still pending. Between April and July, the administration issued 5,641 special visas, the White House press office told PolitiFact. Add to that the 789 issued between January and March, and the total on Biden’s watch is 6,430. But Biden talked about ""translators"" — which can be read broadly as the workers covered by the special immigrant visa program — and to nail down those numbers would require data on how many actual workers, as opposed to family members, have received visas. We don’t have firm data on how many of 5,641 are the people who worked with U.S. forces or agencies, but what we do have points to a much lower figure. The latest State Department report for January through March shows 137 visas issued to the Afghan employees — called principal applicants — and 652 issued to their family members. That suggests that a bit under a fifth of the total were visas for the employees. A higher fraction came from State Department spokesman Ned Price, when he briefed reporters on a different group of Afghans in the approval pipeline. Price said that workers were about 700 out of 2,500 applicants who had been approved for entry (but hadn't necessarily received a visa yet). That suggests just under 30% of the total are Afghan employees. Applying that higher percentage to the 5,641 from April through July, and adding the 137 from the first quarter would suggest that about 1,720 Afghan employees got special visas since January. Many thousands more are still in line. As of May, there were ""approximately 18,000 Afghan principal applicants at some stage of this process,"" Price at the State Department said. That process has been difficult, as officials balance the desire to protect workers with the need to weed out impostors and potential terrorists. An application passes through five separate government agencies, bouncing between the embassy in Kabul and offices in the United States. The paperwork requirements are stringent, and for many, employment records no longer exist. ""This makes you realize how much of a miracle it is that anyone receives a special immigrant visa at all,"" said former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker in Senate testimony. The White House told PolitiFact it had reduced the processing time to an average of nine to 12 months as of May, from two years. The administration has increased the embassy staff to move applications forward. Congress increased the number of special visas by 8,000. But by one estimate, based on the backlog of 18,000 principal applicants, the U.S. faces the task of vetting over 70,000 visas for workers and their family members. Biden said that the United States had issued several thousand special visas to Afghan translators who had helped Americans. Based on the available data, the actual number of Afghan employees who have received a visa is likely closer to 1,700. On the other hand, the total number of Afghans helped is over 6,400, and the administration has sped up the processing time. There is a backlog of about 18,000 Afghans who worked with Americans who have started the visa application process. We rate this claim Half True.","[('ABC News, Full transcript of George Stephanopoulos interview with President Joe Biden, Aug. 19, 2021', 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/full-transcript-abc-news-george-stephanopoulos-interview-president/story?id=79535643'), ('U.S. State Department, FY 2021 Q2 Status of the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa Program, April 2021', 'No link'), ('U.S. State Department, Press Briefing, July 19, 2021', 'https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/SIVs/Afghan-Public-Quarterly-Report-Q2-April-2021.pdf'), ('U.S. State Department, Press briefing, July 12, 2021', 'No link'), ('Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Special Immigrant Visas for Foreign Interpreters, June 23, 2021', 'https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-july-19-2021/'), ('Migration Policy Institute, U.S. Government Rush to Evacuate Afghan Allies and Allocate Sufficient Special Visas Comes at Eleventh Hour, July 27, 2021', 'No link'), ('U.S. Congress, Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009 - as amended, July 30, 2021', 'https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-july-12-2021/'), (""Reuters, Biden's vow to airlift Afghan allies meets ticking clock, risky rescue, Aug. 17, 2021"", 'No link'), ('Email exchange, Vedant Patel, assistant press secretary, White House press office, Aug. 19, 2021', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/06/23/special-immigrant-visas-for-foreign-interpreters-pub-84831')]",/factchecks/2021/aug/19/joe-biden/joe-biden-overshoots-visas-afghans-who-helped-us/

There’s no evidence that 229 Christian missionaries face death sentence in Afghanistan
","In the wake of the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, a Facebook post lamenting the impending execution of 229 Christian missionaries has begun recirculating online. It is not true. The post reads: ""Please pray for the 229 Christian missionaries, who have been sentenced to death tomorrow afternoon by the Afghan Islamists. Please join us in urgent prayer, also because the radical Islamic group has just taken Qaraqosh, the largest Christian city in Iraq. There are hundreds of Christian men, women and children who are being beheaded. Prayer cover is being requested. Please take a minute and pray for them. Pass the message on."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Variations of the post have been shared through email and on social media since 2009. According to Lead Stories, some variations say 22 missionaries face execution, while others attribute the prayer request to Pope Francis. The post offers no evidence for its claim, and we found no news outlets or international organizations that have acknowledged these supposed executions. This post comes as the Taliban takes control of Afghanistan following the final stages of U.S. troop withdrawal. The Taliban previously controlled Afghanistan from 1996 until the U.S. invaded the country following the 9/11 attacks in 2001. The treatment of religious minorities in Afghanistan is cause for concern since the Taliban has a history of persecuting Christians and other religious groups. But there is no evidence that the Taliban or ""Afghan Islamists"" will soon execute missionaries. Estimates of the Christian population in Afghanistan are between 2,000 and 3,000, according to a 2013 U.S. International Religious Freedom Report. The post also jumps from Afghanistan to outdated news about Qaraqosh, a city in Iraq where Christians previously faced persecution. In 2014 Christians fled Qaraqosh, known as Iraq’s Christian capital, after the Islamic State, the militant group known as ISIS, began to take over the city. At the time, Pope Francis called on the international community to address the crisis, according to the BBC. The Islamic State was ousted from Qaraqosh in 2016, and since then, about half the city’s population has returned and started to rebuild. On a visit to Qaraqosh this year, Pope Francis encouraged residents to continue rebuilding. ""The road to a full recovery may still be long, but I ask you, please, not to grow discouraged,"" he said. A Facebook post claimed that 229 Christian missionaries were sentenced to death by Afghan Islamists. Variations of this claim have circulated since 2009, and there is no evidence that ""Afghan Islamists"" or the Taliban will soon execute Christian missionaries.

Firm led by top donor to Fla. Gov. Ron DeSantis isn’t a major Regeneron investor
","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has staked out positions contrary to public health guidance on COVID-19, opposing some preventive measures, while emphasizing treatment. Now the Republican is being accused by a liberal group of favoring one of his political donors in his response to the pandemic. DeSantis ""has been discouraging masking and downplaying Covid vaccines,"" and instead is urging Floridians to use a treatment from the drug company Regeneron ""after getting infected,"" Democratic Underground says in an Instagram post. ""You’ll be amazed to learn that the second-largest investor in Regeneron is Citadel Investment Group,"" whose CEO, Ken Griffin, is ""DeSantis’ number one political donor,"" the post claims. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Griffin is a major campaign donor to DeSantis, but his firm is only a small investor in Regeneron, and one of more than a thousand institutions with a stake in the company.  The governor’s press secretary, Christina Pushaw, said DeSantis ""decided to actively promote Regeneron because it’s a clinically proven treatment that saves lives and alleviates pressure on hospitals. No donor had anything to do with the Governor’s decision."" On Nov. 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization to Tarrytown, N.Y.-based Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. for its REGEN-COV to treat mild to moderate COVID-19. The product consists of two monoclonal antibodies, which are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight off harmful pathogens such as viruses. On Aug. 10, 2021, the FDA revised the authorization, allowing for emergency use of REGEN-COV as a preventive drug for people who are exposed to the virus and are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19. The agency said the treatment is not a substitute for vaccination.  DeSantis has urged people infected with the virus to take the drug, which was used by former President Donald Trump after he became infected. On Aug. 18, DeSantis announced the opening of another state clinic that offers the treatment. The state promotes a website that lists sites for the treatment, along with COVID-19 testing and vaccinations. The governor’s office also referred us to the website. To support the first part of its claim — that Citadel Investment Group is the second-largest investor in Regeneron — Democratic Underground cited a June 28 Yahoo Finance article that says ""the second-largest stake"" in Regeneron is held by Citadel Investment Group, which ""holds a $171.2 million call position."" But that article was referring to a group of 39 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, a finance website. Among those 39 hedge funds, the article said, Citadel had the second-largest investment in Regeneron. That does not make it the second-largest overall investor in Regeneron — not by a long shot. The article said Citadel’s position was a $171.2 million call position. A call position by itself does not represent ownership — it’s an option to purchase stock.  Asked about that discrepancy, Democratic Underground changed the text in its post to mention the call position and added a correction, but still erroneously referred to Citadel holding the second-largest call position in Regeneron. Data from Nasdaq shows that as of June 30, Regeneron had more than 1,000 institutional investors. The top five were FMR LLC (known as Fidelity Investments), Blackrock, Vanguard Group, Capital World Investors and State Street. Each had between 4 million and 11 million shares.   Citadel Advisors, part of Griffin’s company, owned 57,768 shares as of June 30, tripling its holdings from the previous quarter, according to Nasdaq. That amounts to less than 0.1% of Regeneron’s 105 million shares outstanding.  The second part of the claim — that Griffin, CEO of Chicago-based Citadel, is DeSantis’ No. 1 donor — doesn’t state a time frame. But there is evidence that Griffin is a major donor. Democratic Underground cited a May 10 Florida Politics article about donations to DeSantis’ political action committee in April. The article said Griffin was the largest donor, giving $5 million of the $14 million taken in that month.  According to the Florida Division of Elections, Griffin made contributions totaling $5.75 million to DeSantis’ political action committee in 2018, when DeSantis won election as governor; and the $5 million contribution in April 2021. DeSantis is up for re-election in 2022, and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. Florida Republican Party Executive Director Helen Aguirre Ferré told PolitiFact that Griffin ""is one of the governor’s top donors."" Democratic Underground claimed that ""the second-largest investor in Regeneron"" is a firm whose CEO is DeSantis’ ""number one political donor."" Citadel’s CEO is a major donor to the Florida governor’s political action committee, and his firm has investments in Regeneron, a company that makes a drug product for treating COVID-19. But it is far from being the second-largest investor in Regeneron.

Facebook post omits context about COVID outbreak aboard British naval ships
","Skeptics of the COVID-19 vaccines have often seized on reports of breakthrough infections, — when vaccinated people contract the virus — to cast doubt on the vaccines’ effectiveness. A recent Facebook post fits that pattern. The Aug. 12 post is a screenshot of a tweet from a user named Melissa Tate, in which she claims sailors aboard a British naval ship were infected with COVID-19 despite being vaccinated. ""100 sailors isolated at sea. All vaxxed. All with COVID 7 weeks following deployment,"" the tweet reads. Tate, a conservative author who has shared pandemic-related misinformation, also includes a link to a BBC News story about the COVID-19 outbreak with her tweet.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Both the tweet from Tate and the BBC story are real, and the description of the incident is accurate. But they leave out important context about the situation.   The Royal Navy’s aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth was about seven weeks into a 28-week deployment with several other ships when the navy announced 100 cases of the virus were discovered on the ship during routine testing around July 4, according to the BBC. Positive cases were also found on other ships in the fleet. Around 3,700 crew members are part of the fleet, with about 1,600 people serving on the aircraft carrier. None of the infected sailors developed any serious symptoms from the virus or have been hospitalized. ""Our crew are double vaccinated, so you'll be glad to know there is no serious effects on any of the crew, and we will manage it,"" Ben Wallace, the United Kingdom’s defense secretary, said in a July 13 press conference, the Independent reported. The positive cases did not affect the fleet's deployment, according to France 24. The Royal Navy implemented safety precautions such as face coverings, physical distancing and contact tracing to help curb the outbreak's spread. Although Wallace did not say which type of vaccine sailors received, the Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines are currently authorized for use in the United Kingdom. Studies have shown the COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at protecting people against the virus, although recent research suggests the delta variant of the virus has diminished the protection somewhat. No vaccine has been shown to be  100% effective, and breakthrough infections do occur. In those cases, studies continue to show that vaccination significantly reduces the risk of severe illness, hospitalization and death. Recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that, of the more than 166 million people who have been fully vaccinated in the United States, there were 8,054 people — a tiny fraction of 1% — with breakthrough COVID-19 infections who were hospitalized or died. About three-quarters of them were 65 or older. Not all the hospitalizations or deaths were related to COVID. The CDC says that because its monitoring depends in part on passive and voluntary reporting — and only 49 states and territories report their data to the CDC — the figures are likely an undercount and may not be completely representative of all breakthrough infections in the country. A Facebook post reshared a tweet claiming 100 sailors aboard a British naval ship contracted COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated against the virus.  That did happen, and such breakthrough infections are expected. The 100 sailors were among a crew of 1,600 on an aircraft carrier.

Charlie Kirk baselessly claims Biden intentionally let Afghanistan fall to alter U.S. population
","Hours before President Joe Biden addressed the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in a speech to the nation, one conservative commentator falsely accused Biden of intentionally letting the country fall as part of a ""sinister"" plot to boost Democrats’ political prospects. ""The most important thing for the Democrats is having permanent political control,"" Charlie Kirk said Aug. 16 on his radio show and podcast. ""Now, you might be saying, ‘Alright Charlie, what does the fall of Kabul have to do with Democrats taking over political control?’""  Kirk, the founder and president of Turning Point USA, continued:  ""President Joe Biden's Department of Defense will accept 30,000 Afghan refugees into military installations following the collapse of Kabul. Boom, political transformation. Let the country crumble. Do you know there's 5 million displaced people in Afghanistan now? This was all intentional. Joe Biden let it fall apart to now say, ‘Oh, I'm so sorry.’ …  ""Do you see what's going on here? What's going on here is Joe Biden wants a couple hundred thousand more Ilhan Omars to come into America to change the body politic permanently."" There were several factual and logical problems with Kirk’s claims. For one thing, it takes several years before a refugee resettled in the U.S. can become eligible to vote. And more to the point, there’s no evidence of the plot that Kirk described on his show. ""I have seen no evidence that President Biden let Kabul fall or took the actions he did related to Afghanistan so that the U.S. could bring in more refugees and change the population in a way that favors Democrats,"" said Christopher Preble, a foreign policy expert at the Atlantic Council. Kirk’s claim echoed the ""replacement theory,"" which is often found in white supremacist rhetoric and warns that the U.S.’s white European population is being replaced by non-white immigrants. A spokesperson for Kirk said Kirk was expressing an opinion. But he presented his claims as fact, and the next day, he claimed again that the Democrats’ agenda is ""more people into the United States."" ""Their goal is: Go break the country, cause chaos, give the American people a sense of guilt and a sense of an obligation to then go all-of-a-sudden accept the continued cultural transformation of America,"" Kirk said Aug. 17. Other conservative commentators, including Tucker Carlson and Tomi Lahren, made similar claims or suggestions about a ploy to bring in more refugees. Rep. Ilhan Omar is a Democratic congresswoman representing Minnesota. She was a refugee from Somalia, which is in Africa.  Taliban fighters patrol in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Aug. 19, 2021. (AP) The Taliban’s swift takeover of Afghanistan marked an end to the roughly two decades of American intervention that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. With little resistance from the Afghan forces funded with billions of U.S. dollars, the Taliban took back control in just a few weeks. But there’s no evidence that the fall of Kabul, the Afghan capital, was the ""intentional"" outcome of a Biden scheme to change the U.S. population in favor of Democrats, as Kirk claimed.  ""He did not have to let the government fall to generate Afghan refugees,"" said Barnett Rubin, a senior fellow at the Center for International Cooperation at New York University. Asked about Kirk’s claim, the White House pointed to Biden’s speech to the nation. In it, he laid much of the blame for Kabul’s fall at the feet of the Afghan leaders who fled the country and the Afghan military he said ""collapsed, sometimes without trying to fight.""  President Joe Biden speaks about Afghanistan from the White House on Aug. 16, 2021, in Washington. (AP) Biden acknowledged that the Taliban seized power quicker than anticipated, and that the U.S. withdrawal was ""far from perfect."" But there’s no proof that the president ""let it fall apart"" on purpose to boost his party’s political prospects — and Kirk offered none. Preble, of the Atlantic Council, said responsibility for the failure of Afghan forces to withstand the Taliban rests more with past administrations than with Biden’s. ""The United States, going back to George W. Bush’s administration, spent nearly $89 billion to train these forces,"" he said.  Biden said following through with the withdrawal from Afghanistan fulfilled his promise to end the prolonged, costly and unpopular conflict. He argued that more time in Afghanistan would make little difference, and that resources would be better spent focusing on counterterrorism.  He also said he feared opening U.S. troops up to attacks from the Taliban if he reneged on the agreement negotiated by former President Donald Trump, who made the original deal scheduling the withdrawal of U.S. forces. The final 2,500 U.S. forces began to leave Afghanistan in May. The Defense Department referred PolitiFact to press secretary John Kirby’s public statements. Kirby has said the U.S. was caught off guard by how easily the Afghan forces backed down. Kirk suggested that the potential arrival of more Afghan refugees would have a dramatic impact on the U.S. electorate — enough to give Democrats ""permanent political control"" in a country of roughly 331 million people. Kirk offered no evidence that Afghan refugees would vote for Democrats, or that they would vote at all. Even if all 400,000 of the internally displaced Afghans the United Nations says were forced from their homes in 2021 were to somehow become voting citizens of the U.S., there’s no guarantee that they would all cast their ballots for Democrats or be able to sway elections. More than 159 million people voted in the 2020 election, and Biden won by 7 million votes. What’s more, it would be years before the fraction of them who could realistically reach U.S. soil could become U.S. citizens eligible to vote in elections — and that doesn’t account for the typical, multi-year delays involved in getting designated as a refugee or securing a special immigrant visa, earning admission into the U.S. and becoming naturalized.  ""No one can enter as a refugee or green card holder and automatically become a U.S. citizen,"" said Susan Akram, a clinical professor of law at Boston University School of Law. Refugee resettlement is the process through which refugees fleeing persecution in their home countries are transferred from the country in which they have sought protection to a third nation that has agreed to admit them and potentially grant them permanent residence.  Migrants walk in the countryside in Tatvan, in Bitlis Province, eastern Turkey, on Aug. 18, 2021. (AP) Refugees who come to the U.S. must wait one year after entering to apply for lawful permanent resident status, said Karla McKanders, a clinical law professor and the founding director of the Immigration Practice Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School. Once they achieve that status, they have to wait five more years before they can start the multi-step process to become a U.S. citizen. That’s in addition to the time spent before refugees reach the U.S., McKanders said. In Nashville, McKanders said she has represented Kurdish refugees who spent up to a decade in refugee camps before they were even interviewed to determine if they could resettle in the U.S. Plus, it’s not immediately clear how the situation in Afghanistan will affect the flow of refugees and other migrants into the U.S. and elsewhere, and there are limits on the number of refugees the U.S. can bring in to begin with. Biden has allocated new funds for relocating refugees, and governors from both parties have expressed willingness to take in people fleeing Afghanistan. In his speech, Biden said the U.S. is expanding refugee program access to cover certain Afghans who worked for a U.S. embassy, nongovernmental organization or media outlet and are referred by their employers. To support Kirk’s claim, Kirk’s spokesperson pointed to Biden’s vow to eventually increase refugee admissions from all countries to 125,000. The spokesperson claimed that Afghanistan’s collapse could be used to justify bringing tens of thousands of refugees in.   Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk speaks during a summit at the Marriott Marquis in Washington on July 23, 2019. (AP) But Biden set the refugee admissions cap to 62,500 for the 2021 fiscal year. And the system, whittled down under Trump and the pandemic, is still operating on a smaller scale and with delays, said Akram, who also directs Boston University’s International Human Rights Clinic. Fewer than 500 Afghans have been admitted to the U.S. as refugees this year, Akram said.  Interpreters and others who worked for the U.S. government may be eligible for what are known as ""special immigrant visas,"" which are granted separate from the refugee program. These visa recipients are not classified as refugees under the legal definition, and their admission does not count against the annual U.S. cap on refugees from around the globe, according to the New York Times. But only 34,500 special immigrant visas have been allocated to Afghans in total since December 2014, although applicants can typically bring spouses and children, who do not count toward that limit. Thousands of those cases remain backlogged, experts said Kirk referenced a Fox News report that the U.S. plans to potentially house up to 30,000 Afghan special immigrant visa applicants at military bases. But whether these Afghans ultimately settle in the U.S. or another country, they will likely also face processing delays, experts said. ""The process to immigrate to the United States as a refugee, asylum seeker or if one is granted a special immigrant visa as an interpreter will not immediately change the demographics of the politic,"" McKanders said, adding that it’s ""unlikely that 30,000 people will be resettled overnight."" Kirk said Biden ""let it fall apart"" in Afghanistan because he ""wants a couple hundred thousand more Ilhan Omars to come into America to change the body politic permanently."" There’s no evidence that Kabul fell to the Taliban as part of an intentional scheme to change the U.S. population in a way that favors Democrats. And even in the highly unlikely scenario that all potential Afghan refugees were to become U.S. voters, there is no evidence about how they would vote or that their votes alone would serve to ""change the body politic permanently.""  There’s also no evidence that the withdrawal of U.S. troops, which happened largely on a schedule struck by Trump, was for that purpose, either. In any event, it takes several years before a refugee resettled in the U.S. could become eligible to vote.

Fauci didn’t doubt vaccine study; he cautioned against using it for choosing a booster
","A Fox News Instagram post suggests that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president’s top medical adviser, was hypocritical in how he assessed a study on the effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. ""SELECTIVE SCIENCE? Fauci doesn’t trust new vaccine research as delta variant surges,"" read the post, which directed readers to a link to an article on Fox News’ website. The post referred to remarks Fauci made in an interview with CBS about how to interpret a recent study on vaccine efficacy. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The text in the post is an inaccurate summary of what Fauci actually said.  Fauci did not say he doesn’t trust the research findings, which indicated a disparity between the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines in their effectiveness at preventing COVID-19 infection. Rather, Fauci pointed out that the preprint study is preliminary, and should not be used as a guide on which vaccine to choose for a booster. When it comes to booster shots, he said, people should get the same vaccine they received originally. The  Aug. 15 Fox News article referenced in the post was headlined: ""Fauci dismisses study on delta efficacy between Moderna, Pfizer as guide for booster shots.""  The story reported on Fauci’s comments the same day on CBS’ ""Face the Nation,"" which urged caution on acting on the results of the preliminary study by the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. A Fox spokesperson referred PolitiFact to Fauci’s comments on ""Face the Nation,"" saying he ""cast doubt"" on the study. Here’s the exchange between Fauci and ""Face the Nation"" host Nancy Cordes: Cordes: ""You know, you brought up the efficacy of the vaccines. I want to ask you about this new study out of Minnesota that suggested that the Moderna vaccine is actually more effective against the delta variant than the Pfizer vaccine. Does this study indicate that, if and when people do have to get booster shots, that they should go ahead and get a Moderna shot even if they got Pfizer the first time around?"" Fauci: ""No, Nancy, not at all, because that study, first of all, it’s a preprint study, it hasn't been fully peer-reviewed. I don't doubt what they're seeing, but there are a lot of confounding variables in there about when one was started, the relative amount of people in that cohort, that's delta versus alpha.  ""Right now ... we're talking about boosters. We already implemented boosters for the immune-compromised. It's clear we want to make sure we get people, if possible, to get the boost from the original vaccine that they had. But remember, the original dose of the Moderna is about three times what the dose of the Pfizer is. So, you may have a difference in durability but, in general, the vaccines that have been approved for emergency use authorization — and, hopefully, will be approved for a full authorization in the sense of actual approval, hopefully that comes very soon — are all really highly effective in preventing severe disease."" The Mayo Clinic study was posted Aug. 9 on a website for preprints. Preprint studies are preliminary, in that they have not yet been peer reviewed by other experts, and ""should not be used to guide clinical practice,"" says a notice posted with the study. The researchers compared the effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in the Mayo Clinic Health System (Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin) from January to July.  Among the findings: Both vaccines were ""proven to reduce the burden of symptomatic disease, hospitalization and death related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study further supports the effectiveness of both vaccines in doing so, even despite the evolution of more transmissible viral variants."" For July, when the more contagious delta variant took hold across the U.S., the vaccines’ effectiveness for preventing infection dropped — to 76% for Moderna’s vaccine and 42% for Pfizer’s. That was the finding that the ""Face the Nation"" host alluded to. While both vaccines ""strongly protect against infection and severe disease, there are differences in their real-world effectiveness relative to each other and relative to prior months of the pandemic. Larger studies with more diverse populations are warranted to guide critical pending public and global health decisions, such as the optimal timing for booster doses and which vaccines should be administered to individuals who have not yet received one dose."" A Fox News Instagram post claimed that ""Fauci doesn’t trust new vaccine research as delta variant surges."" That’s not an accurate interpretation of what he said. Fauci said he did not doubt the findings of a preliminary study on the effectiveness of the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. But he cautioned that the study’s findings are preliminary, and said they should not be used to make decisions about which vaccine to take for a booster shot.

Ron Paul says he did the best of the GOP candidates in an Iowa poll matchup with Obama
","
Ron Paul of Texas says he’s battling a false impression that he can’t triumph in a general election. 
John King of CNN asked the candidates at the Feb. 22, 2012, Republican presidential debate to help ""the voters who still have questions about you"" and explain the ""biggest misconception about you"" in the public debate. 
""I would say the perpetuation of the myth by the media that I can't win"" while some statistics show the contrary, said Paul, a Lake Jackson congressman. ""Just recently, there was a poll in Iowa, and it matched all the four of us up against (President Barack) Obama. And guess what? I did the very best."" 
Nationally, at the end of February 2012, Obama was outpacing each of the Republican hopefuls in one-on-one matchup polls, according to aggregations of results by RealClearPolitics.com. The ""spread"" was smallest for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (4-point lead for Obama), followed by former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum (5-point lead for Obama) and Paul (6.6-point lead for Obama). Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was the furthest behind Obama, down 12.4 points. 
But did Paul accurately recap an Iowa poll? 
Paul spokesman Gary Howard told us that Paul was referring to a Des Moines Register poll, the results of which the newspaper wrote about on its website Feb. 19, 2012. 
Selzer & Co., a West Des Moines firm, conducted the telephone survey of 800 Iowans Feb. 12-15, 2012. As part of the poll, 611 likely voters were asked to indicate who they would vote for in matchups between Obama and each of the four major Republican candidates. The questions were phrased this way: ""If the election for president were held today, and the candidates were Barack Obama for the Democrats and (name of GOP candidate) for the Republicans, for whom would you vote?"" 
The results show all the candidates except Gingrich beating Obama in Iowa, with Paul winning by the greatest margin, as noted in the Register’s articles. 
The details: 
** Paul 49 percent, Obama 42 percent (7-point difference)
** Santorum 48, Obama 44 (4-point difference)
** Romney 46, Obama 44 (2-point difference)
** Gingrich 37, Obama 51 (14-point difference) 
Straightforward, right? 
Not entirely. Interviews of pollsters led us to realize that there’s at least debate over the significance of the poll’s margin of error, which for the matchup questions in the Iowa Poll was plus or minus four percentage points. 
Margins of error hint at every poll’s built-in weakness: It’s impossible to survey every voter. 
In a write-up about polling, Selzer & Co. President J. Ann Selzer defines the margin of error as the estimated difference between a percentage obtained from a survey of a sample of voters — for example, the 49 percent in the Iowa Poll who said they would vote for Paul in a contest with Obama — and the percentage the firm theoretically would find if it interviewed every likely voter in the state. 
She explains further: Consider, she says, a report from her firm that a candidate has captured 60 percent of the vote in a survey with a margin of error of plus or minus four points. That means, she says, that if the survey were repeated in the same way at the same time with different samples of voters, 95 percent of the time, the percentage of support for the candidate would fall between 56 percent and 64 percent (a range of four more and four less than the reported percentage). 
Applying the margin of error in the Iowa Poll’s matchup questions demonstrates how much the actual results could swing. 
For Paul vs. Obama, the possibilities range from a 15-point Paul lead — Paul 53 (reported result plus four), Obama 38 (result minus four) — to a 1-point Obama lead — Paul 45 (result minus four), Obama 46 (result plus four). 
For Santorum vs. Obama, the matchup range goes from a 12-point Santorum lead (Santorum 52, Obama 40) to a 4-point Obama lead (Santorum 44, Obama 48). 
For Romney vs. Obama, the range is from a 10-point Romney lead to a 6-point Obama lead. 
And for Gingrich, the possibilities range from a 6-point Obama lead to a 22-point Obama lead. 
We asked five polling experts about Paul’s characterization of the Iowa results. There was no argument from anyone that Paul had accurately recapped the poll’s reported results. 
Still, Charlie Leonard, a visiting professor at Southern Illinois University who conducts polls for the school’s Paul Simon Public Policy Institute, told us that in his view, there’s no statistical difference between Paul and Santorum’s performance against Obama. 
However, Selzer, head of the firm that conducted the poll, aligned with Paul’s interpretation of the results. She said the best estimate of Paul’s support — and that of the other Republicans and Obama — is the percentage found during the survey and reported in the poll. She acknowledged that Paul’s percentage of support, for example, could be one, two, three or four points lower — or higher — than 49 in a matchup with Obama. But, she said, technically speaking, that’s less likely to be the case, because each point you move away from the reported number has a lower probability of being true. 
Jim Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas and co-director of joint polling projects for the university and the Texas Tribune, described the difference between the Paul-Obama and Santorum-Obama matchup as marginal and said Paul’s statement ""ignores the underlying statistics of those numbers"" while being literally correct. Henson’s take on the margin of error: ""What it tells you is that the most probable outcome is the two numbers (reported in the poll), and the farther you go off those numbers, the less likely they are to be true — but they might be."" 
Our ruling 
Paul had the largest lead on Obama of any of the major Republicans in matchup polling in Iowa in February 2012. Still, experts raised questions about how statistically certain that conclusion is, considering how close the poll’s results were. To us, that is additional information needed to evaluate Paul’s claim, and so, his statement rates Mostly True.","[('\nCNN, transcript, Arizona Republican presidential debate, Feb. 22, 2012', 'http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1202/22/se.05.html'), ('\nRealClearPolitics.com, average results for matchup polls of Republican candidates vs. President Barack Obama based on February polls (accessed Feb. 29, 2012)', 'No link'), ('\nRon Paul presidential campaign website, press release, ""Ron Paul leads Obama in key swing state of Iowa"" (accessed Feb. 23, 2012)', 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKSpdTPQRVCouc7FByOAFv_n3D08sADvUW0UuwJnK1M/edit'), ('\nDes Moines Register, article, ""Iowa Poll, main story: Obama trails trio from GOP,"" Feb. 19, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nDes Moines Register, article, ""Iowa Poll, the match-ups: Paul does best vs. Obama; then Santorum, Romney,"" Feb. 19, 2012', 'http://www.ronpaul2012.com/2012/02/20/ron-paul-leads-obama-in-key-swing-state-of-iowa/'), ('\nSelzer & Co., details of Iowa Poll, conducted Feb. 12-15, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nJ.

Gingrich uses Reagan record to make case for his campaign
","Former Georgia congressman Newt Gingrich was feeling nostalgic Wednesday. Or at least hoping voters here feel that way next week.

Gingrich, now a Virginia resident, spoke to the Georgia House of Representatives to gather support in a state the Republican has repeatedly said he must win Tuesday in order to stay in the race for the White House.

Gingrich talked one particular achievement that he and his fellow members of Congress were able to accomplish with Republicans favorite Republican, President Ronald Reagan, during the 1980s. They created 16 million jobs during the Reagan years, he said.

It could be done again under a Gingrich presidency, the candidate said.

Perhaps. But we wondered if Gingrich was correct about that number under the Reagan years.

Gingrich served in Congress from 1979 to 1999, the final four years as U.S. House Speaker. Reagan took office in 1981 and left the White House in January 1989.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps the most widely used data on employment, which can be accessed on its website on a month-by-month basis. In January 1981, the month Reagan took office, there were slightly more than 91 million Americans employed. By January 1989, the total was 107.1 million Americans.

That’s an increase of 16.1 million employed Americans.

There is some debate about how much credit Reagan deserves for the increase. First, what types of jobs were these?

Reagan’s supply side economic policies were debated intensely at the time. Critics contend those policies resulted in the rich getting richer and the poor becoming poorer. Conservatives say his tax cuts were the catalyst of the nation’s economic revival in the mid 1980s.

The Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute released a report in 1996 that found the median family income of Americans rose by nearly 1 percent a year under Reagan, which they concluded was higher than the years before and after he was in office. A U.S. Census Bureau chart we found shows a similar increase, although median salaries rose higher for whites than African-Americans and Hispanics. Asian-Americans weren’t included in the chart.

The first two years of Reagan’s presidency saw a economic downturn that included the decline of about 2.3 million employed Americans and an unemployment rate that rose from 7.5 percent to 10.8 percent. The unemployment rate was 5.4 percent by the end of Reagan’s presidency.

Some argue Reagan’s predecessor, Jimmy Carter, was responsible for some economic policies that helped during the Reagan years. Others contend the increase in employed Americans were largely a result of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and expanding the money supply, policies used after the recent Great Recession.

Gingrich’s numbers are accurate. Reagan’s policies, many of which required the support of Congress, deserve some credit for the increase.

Cantor says Obama promised the stimulus would keep unemployment under 8 percent
","
Like many Republicans, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was not in a celebratory mood on the the third anniversary of President Barack Obama’s signing of the stimulus bill.

Cantor, R-7th, fired out a four-paragraph statement saying the stimulus -- a package of government spending, tax cuts and aid to cash-strapped states that was designed to jolt the economy  -- is a failure.

""Three years ago, President Obama’s first action in office was to push through a massive $825 billion stimulus package based on the promise of keeping unemployment under 8 percent,"" Cantor said in the Feb. 16 statement.

The claim that Obama promised the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent has been a favorite talking point among Republicans, including presidential candidate Mitt Romney, U.S. Senate hopeful George Allen of Virginia and House Speaker John Boehner. Cantor made a similar claim back in 2009.

PolitiFact has examined the statement repeatedly, each time rating it Mostly False. Since the claim is making the rounds again, we took a new look.

Megan Whittemore, a Cantor spokeswoman, backed her boss’s statement by referring to a widely cited report from Jan. 9, 2009. It was authored by Christina Romer, the incoming chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, chief economic adviser for incoming Vice President Joe Biden.

The report contains a chart on page 4 predicting unemployment rates in subsequent years.

The chart shows that without a recovery plan totaling about $775 billion, the U.S. unemployment rate was expected to peak at 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, it shows unemployment was projected to top out at just under 8 percent towards the end of 2009.  

We now know that the unemployment rate cleared 8 percent in February 2009 and stayed above that level ever since. It peaked at 10 percent in October 2009 and was down to 8.3 percent in January 2012, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But contrary to Cantor’s claim, the Romer-Bernstein report did not make promises about the unemployment rate. It made qualified projections.

Page 2 of the report states, ""It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error. There is the obvious uncertainty that comes from modeling a hypothetical package rather than the final legislation passed by the Congress. But, there is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program.

""Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""

Obama, in a radio address 10 days before his inauguration, said, ""The report confirms that our plan (that the stimulus) will likely save or create 3 million to 4 million jobs.""

Whittemore said in an email to Politifact Virginia, ""If, as a Virginian or American citizen, I listened to the president’s address and referred to the report on Jan. 10 (the day of his address), I would have found the infamous chart showing that unemployment would stay below 8 percent if the stimulus were to pass. My main take away would naturally be that with passage of the stimulus, unemployment would never go above 8 percent. Why would I believe that? Because President Obama told me so.""

Obama, in his speech, never mentioned the 8 percent figure. He did not use the word ""promise,"" nor refer to the graph on page 4. He said the report contained ""projections of how many jobs (the stimulus) will create.

And we suspect people who were interested enough to read the report would have seen the disclaimer on Page 2 and other qualifying language in the document.

No doubt, the 8 percent unemployment projection was rosy. The Congressional Budget Office, one month after the Romer-Bernstein report was released, estimated unemployment would level off at 8.5 percent with the stimulus and 9 percent without it. Those numbers, too, turned out to be overly optimistic.

The Obama administration has acknowledged the Romer-Bernstein report underestimated the severity of the recession. ""The truth is, we and everyone else misread the economy,"" Vice-President Joe Biden told ABC in July 2009.

The report’s projection that the stimulus would save between 3 million and 4 million jobs also appears now to be optimistic. The president’s Council of Economic Advisers, in an analysis released in December, estimated that between 2.2 million and 4.2 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the second quarter of 2011.

The council’s report cited independent studies by the Congressional Budget Office and three private economic analysis companies. Here’s what the groups found:

• CBO: Between 500,000 and 2.9 million jobs saved or created.

• IHS/Global Insight: 2.4 million jobs saved or created.

• Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.6 million jobs saved or created.

• Moody’s Economy.com: 2.1 million jobs saved or created.

Our ruling

Cantor said Obama’s stimulus was passed with the ""promise"" of keeping the unemployment rate below 8 percent.

The majority leader says the vow was made in a January 2009 report issued by the incoming administration. But the study did not guarantee specific results from the stimulus, it offered economic projections that contained disclaimers saying the estimates had ""significant margins of error"" and a high degree of uncertainty due to a recession that was ""unusual both in its fundamental causes and severity.""

Clearly, the Obama administration can be faulted for estimating the stimulus would hold unemployment just below 8 percent. But contrary to Cantor’s claim, Obama never promised that outcome, nor did his administration.

Again, we rate the statement Mostly False.

Texas-based PAC says Marcy Kaptur really lives in a fancy, suburban-Washington condo
","
Redistricting chewed up Rep. Dennis Kucinich’s old 10th Congressional District and him in the same new 9th Congressional House District as Rep. Marcy Kaptur. The two now are pit against each other in the March 6 Democratic primary.

The location of their Ohio residency doesn’t actually matter legally. Members of the House are not constitutionally required to live in the districts they represent -- only to be an ""inhabitant"" of the that state.

An ad from a Texas-based political action committee, though, trys to turn residency into an issue against Kaptur.

A 30-second cable TV ad paid by the Campaign for Primary Accountability says the congresswoman  ""actually lives"" in a ""fancy condo in the Washington, D.C., suburbs"" valued at $488,000.

It dings her for saying in her own campaign ad that she lives in the same Toledo house where she grew up, and says she was late paying her property taxes in Ohio nine times.

In support of its claims, the Campaign for Primary Accountability provided a copy of Kaptur's property assessment by the city of Alexandria, Va., and copies of site-search data from the Lucas County auditor in Ohio.

Kaptur's campaign disputed the context but not the specific claims to PolitiFact Ohio and other reporters.

""She does not live there (in Alexandria),"" spokesman Steve Fought said. ""She has a place where she stays. When the gavel falls and the (House) session ends, she is out of there like a rocket and back home with her brother.

""Marcy Kaptur lives in the house where she grew up, which she inherited from her parents, with her brother, who is disabled.""

The house and property are valued at $68,800 by the Lucas County auditor. That house serves as her voting residence for the Lucas County Board of Elections.

Kaptur's campaign acknowledged that she has paid a total of $295.20 in late fees on property taxes going back to 2006. Five instances involved three rental properties in her neighborhood.

""She has always paid her taxes on her home and rental properties within 10 days of the due date except in one instance, when she was six weeks overdue and paid the penalty,"" spokesman Matthew Klempner said.

He said the congresswoman is ""fully current"" on real estate taxes.

The average condominium in Alexandria valued below Kaptur's at $266,919, according to the city budget director. The average value for all homes there was $632,958.

Kaptur's campaign noted that the PAC ad does not mention that Kucinich bought a blighted, foreclosed house in Washington, D.C., in 2009, and that it has a current assessed value of $404,910.

What does it add up to?

First, we note that Washington area real estate values are not the same as those found in northern Ohio, so that the assessed values are much higher should not be a surprise. We also note that members of Congress do have to have a place to stay while serving in Washington. But that doesn’t mean that their permanent legal residence moves with them.

In that regard, the ad’s claim is inaccurate. Kaptur does spend at least part of her year, when Congress is in session, in a condo in suburban Washington.

By asserting that she ""actually lives"" there, however, the ad suggests that is her permanent residence, a claim that Kaptur disputes and that is not supported by her voter registration and her property tax payments in Ohio.

Following that rationale, she would be ineligible to run for her seat from Ohio. And the same argument could be applied to virtually every other member of Congress.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.","[('\nToledo Blade, ""Kucinich aide decries Kaptur residency claim,"" Feb. 26, 2012\n\nThe Plain Dealer via Cleveland.com, ""Ads get nastier in Kucinich-Kaptur race as Super PAC enters the fray,"" Feb. 28, 2012,\n\nCampaign for Primary Accountability, ""Taxes,"" Feb. 28, 2012\n\nThe Plain Dealer, ""Texas Super PAC does robo-calls, mailings on behalf of Dennis Kucinich,"" Feb. 08, 2012\n\nU.S. National Archives, U.S. Constitution\n\nEmail from Campaign for Primary Accountability, Feb. 28, 2012\n\nLucas County, Ohio, auditor, \xa0Real Estate Information System\n\nInterview with Kaptur campaign spokesman Steve Fought, Feb. 29, 2012\n\nAlexandria, Va., Real Property Assessment Overview, Feb. 23, 2012', 'http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2012/02/26/Kucinich-aide-decries-Kaptur-residency-claim.html')]",/factchecks/2012/mar/02/campaign-primary-accountability/texas-based-pac-says-marcy-kaptur-really-lives-fan/

Ron Paul ad claims Rick Santorum funded Planned Parenthood
","
Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum says he’s the only consistent conservative in the Republican presidential field, but a new Ron Paul campaign ad says the label is phony.

Paul’s ad calls Santorum a ""counterfeit conservative"" who, among other sins, ""funded Planned Parenthood.""

We decided to check whether Santorum, well known for his opposition to abortion and even contraception in some instances, supported government funding of the controversial women’s health provider.

A look at the funding

When we contacted Paul’s campaign for backup, his spokesman provided us a list of votes that Santorum -- and Paul -- made on large appropriations bills for the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal departments. The bills including funding for something called Title X.

According to the Health and Human Services website, Title X provides ""comprehensive family planning services."" With an emphasis on serving low-income Americans, the services are defined as ""contraceptive services and related counseling"" as well as ""preventive health services such as: patient education and counseling; breast and pelvic examinations; breast and cervical cancer screening according to nationally recognized standards of care; sexually transmitted disease (STD) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevention education, counseling, testing and referral; and pregnancy diagnosis and counseling. By law, Title X funds may not be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.""

Despite the ban on using federal funds for abortions, critics (including Paul) say the funds are ""fungible,"" meaning even though government dollars don’t pay for abortions directly, the funding frees other money that can be used for abortions.

The bulk of Planned Parenthood’s work involves routine women’s health care -- pelvic exams, STD testing and counseling and contraceptives. It is also the country’s biggest abortion provider and a significant recipient of Title X funds.

Santorum’s votes

The list Paul’s campaign sent us shows votes on appropriations bills from 1996, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. In each case, Santorum voted for the bills, and Paul voted against.

Looking closely at the bill from 2006, Santorum’s last HHS appropriations vote in the Senate, the $142.5 billion spending package allocated money for everything from the human genome project to aging services, from the black lung disability trust fund to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

As for Title X: ""$285,963,000 shall be for the program under title X of the Public Health Service Act to provide for voluntary family planning projects.""

Santorum’s response

We didn’t hear back from Santorum’s campaign for this story. But he has spoken on the topic in interviews and debates, explaining that while he personally opposes the use of contraceptives, he supports their availability as a matter of public policy.

Talking to CBS on Feb. 17, 2012, Santorum said, ""It’s funny that I’ve been criticized by Governor Romney and by Ron Paul for actually having voted for something called Title X, which is actually federal funding of contraception. … My public policy beliefs are that this contraception should be available. Again, I’ve supported Title X funding. I’ve also supported abstinence-based education because I believe that is a healthier alternative.""

During a debate in Arizona on Feb. 22, 2012, Santorum struggled to explain his position of having voted for the funding while declaring opposition to it:

""As Congressman Paul knows, I opposed Title X funding. I've always opposed Title X funding, but it's included in a large appropriation bill that includes a whole host of other things, including the funding for the National Institutes of Health, the funding for Health and Human Services and a whole bunch of other departments. It's a multi-billion-dollar bill.

""What I did, because Title X was always pushed through, I did something that no one else did. Congressman Paul didn't. I said, well, if you're going to have Title X funding, then we're going to create something called Title XX, which is going to provide funding for abstinence-based programs, so at least we'll have an opportunity to provide programs that actually work in -- in keeping children from being sexually active instead of facilitating children from being sexually active. And I pushed Title XX … to accomplish that goal. … As president of the United States, I will defund Planned Parenthood; I will not sign any appropriation bill that funds Planned Parenthood.""

Our ruling

Paul’s ad says Santorum funded Planned Parenthood.

His campaign points to Santorum’s yea votes in the Senate on massive appropriations bills for funding the federal government. Title X funding, which funnels family planning dollars to health care providers including Planned Parenthood, was in those spending measures. Santorum has been unclear about where he stands on Title X, saying in one instance that he supports Title X and in another that he opposes it.

In any event, he did not vote separately for Title X but for omnibus multi-billion dollar appropriations measures that funded many other activities. Saying, as the ad does, that he ""funded Planned Parenthood,"" makes it sound like he played a larger role than being one of many votes in favor of a broad-based appropriations bill. In 2006, for instance, he was joined by all but two of his Senate Republican colleagues in voting for the bill. Paul's statement is partially accurate but it leaves out that important context. We rate the claim Half True.","[('\nRon Paul ad ""Three of a Kind,"" Feb. 28, 2012\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services website, ""Title X Family Planning,"" accessed March 1, 2012\n\nPOLITICO, ""Mike Pence’s war on Planned Parenthood,"" Feb. 16, 2011\n\nGovernment Printing Office, H.R.3010 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006\n\nRepublican presidential debate in Mesa, Ariz., Feb. 22, 2012, transcript accessed via Nexis\n\nCBS This Morning, Feb. 17, 2012', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSVi45vfA6o')]",/factchecks/2012/mar/01/ron-paul/ron-paul-ad-claims-rick-santorum-voted-fund-planne/

Obama says the U.S. has a “record number of oil rigs"" and ""more working oil and gas rigs than the rest of the world”
","
President Barack Obama came to the University of Miami to talk about energy, and with Republicans attacking him over a recent spike in gas prices, Obama attacked back.  

""Only in politics do people root for bad news, do they greet bad news so enthusiastically. You pay more; they’re licking their chops,"" Obama told the college crowd on Feb. 23, 2012.

""You can bet that since it’s an election year, they’re already dusting off their 3-point plan for $2 gas. And I’ll save you the suspense. Step one is to drill, and step two is to drill. And then step three is to keep drilling,"" he said.

Obama said we can’t drill our way to lower gas prices, but then he touted current production underway.

""Now, we absolutely need safe, responsible oil production here in America. That’s why under my administration, America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last eight years. That’s why we have a record number of oil rigs operating right now – more working oil and gas rigs than the rest of the world combined.""  
PolitiFact rated Obama’s statement about production being at an eight-year high as Mostly True. Here, we wanted to explore if the U.S. has a record number of oil rigs in operation and more working oil and gas rigs than the rest of the world combined. 
For this report, we're focusing only on the accuracy of Obama's numbers, not whether his administration gets the credit. We should also note that Obama made similar, though not identical remarks a week later in Nashua, N.H. Here, we're looking at his remarks in Miami. 
Recent rig counts in the U.S. and abroad

To define our terms: A rig rotates the drill pipe from the surface to drill a new well to explore for, develop and produce oil or natural gas, according to Baker Hughes, an oilfield services company.

Baker Hughes has done rig counts for decades and does a weekly count of oil and natural gas rigs in the U.S. and Canada. (In fact, when we posed our question to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, they pointed us to Baker Hughes.)

According to Baker Hughes, there were 1,994 rigs in the U.S. and 705 in Canada as of Feb. 17, 2012. The company also conducts a monthly census for active drills outside of the U.S. and Canada. In January 2012, that number was 1,171.

Using those numbers, Obama is right, but there’s a big catch here: Due to the difficulty of data collection, Baker Hughes does not count rigs drilling in Russia or onshore China.

Since Russia and China are such large countries, we contacted experts in the oil industry to ask if including Russia and China could potentially outweigh U.S. rigs.

""I personally suspect the international count is higher, but it is difficult to say definitively based on the available information,"" said Richard Mason, who works for the publication Hart Energy Digital, in an email. ""However, the last numbers I saw out of Russia, which are 18 months old, had more than 1,000 rigs active, which would push the international total above the U.S., even without China.’’

Kurt Abraham, executive editor of World Oil, another energy publication, said he also believes the international rig count would be higher if Russia and China were included. He cited a report from a Chinese state-owned company that manufactures rigs and rig equipment that shows more than 1,000 land rigs.

So Obama’s statement is supported by collected data, but that data undercounts the true number of international rigs.

Historical data on rigs

Now, what about the other half of Obama’s claim that we have a ""record number of oil rigs""?

Obama here is counting only oil rigs, not oil and gas rigs, an important distinction.

News reports in February 2012 stated that the U.S. had hit a record number of oil rigs at 1,272, the most since Baker Hughes separated oil rig and gas rig data in 1987. The U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that 2011 was a record year since data was collected solely on oil rigs starting in the late 1980s. 
The problem here is that much of the data before 1987 combines oil and gas rigs, and some of the counts are much higher than the current total of oil rigs alone. The EIA’s historical rig data shows a high of 4,521 rigs in 1981. Baker Hughes showed a record rig count of 4,530 recorded on Dec. 28, 1981.

The experts we consulted said it’s possible that 1981 was the record year for oil rig counts. We reviewed various estimates that suggested that could be the case.

""In my mind, 1981 probably was the peak,"" said Raoul LeBlanc of PFC Energy, a consulting firm to industry and investors.

But LeBlanc and other experts said rig counts going back that far can be deceptive.

""Those rigs were different rigs than they are today. The ones today are more powerful and can do more and drill more wells and drill them faster,"" LeBlanc said.

Another catch is that the industry arbitrarily assigns rig data to oil or gas; in reality, there can be overlap, with natural gas production coming from oil wells, said Mason of Hart Energy Digital.

Finally, strictly comparing the number of rigs doesn’t tell the full picture of how much oil is being produced, said University of Texas Chair of the Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Tadeusz W Patzek.

""If one looks at an average oil and gas well productivity in Texas and elsewhere in the U.S., it has been declining for several years, and this is a clear warning sign that even with more rigs that are more efficient, we will get less incremental oil (and gas) per rig and per day,"" he wrote in an email.

""One prolific offshore well, like the Macondo well, is equivalent to dozens of low productivity wells in the Bakken shale. So one rig in an offshore environment brings as much oil as several rigs onshore.’’

Still, whatever the causes, domestic drilling is definitely on the upswing.

""The substance of the president's comments, that we are currently involved in one of the most aggressive efforts to pursue energy production domestically, is a generally accurate description of what's happening in our domestic market,"" Mason said.

Our ruling

Obama made two claims here, and neither one is simple to dissect.

Obama’s claim that the U.S. has ""more working oil and gas rigs than the rest of the world combined"" is borne out by the best available data. But that data doesn’t tell the full picture because it excludes China and Russia, where getting accurate rig counts is difficult. 

Obama also said that we have a ""record number of oil rigs operating right now."" That’s true if Obama starts the clock in 1987, but it’s possible that 1981 may have been the record. Again, we can’t say for sure, because record-keeping is incomplete.

He’s right that that the United States is in the midst of a strong effort to increase domestic energy production, but we found evidence that undercuts the literal accuracy of his claims. So we rate this statement Half True.","[('\nPolitiFact, ""Barack Obama says U.S. oil production is at an eight-year high,"" Jan. 24, 2012\n\nWhite House, Remarks by the President on energy, Feb. 23, 2012\n\nMiami Herald, ""President Obama talks gas prices, energy policies -- and raises lots of cash,"" Feb. 24, 2012\n\nHouston Chronicle, ""U.S. oil gusher blows out projections,"" Feb. 19, 2012\n\nStar Telegram, ""Oil rigs hit a U.S. record,"" Feb. 17, 2012\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Rotary Rigs in Operation (Number of Elements), \xa0Feb. 3, 2012', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-oil-production-eight-year-hig/'), ('\nU.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. Crude Oil Rigs in Operation, Feb. 2, 2012\n\nBaker Hughes, Rig counts, Feb. 24, 2012\n\nAmerican Petroleum Institute CEO Jack Gerard statement, ""Administration actions not matching words on energy development,"" Feb. 23, 2012\n\nHILONG, ""Developments in world oil rig manufacturing,"" Feb. 18. 2011\n\nInterview, Clark Stevens, spokesman for President Barack Obama, Feb. 24, 2012\n\nInterview, Eric Holcomb, director of investor relations, Baker Hughes, Feb. 24, 2012\n\nInterview, Bill Bush, spokesman American Petroleum Institute, Feb. 24, 2012\n\nInterview, Raoul LeBlanc, senior director of PFC Energy, Feb. 24, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nInterview, Paul Hesse Catapult Technology, Ltd., Contractor to the\nOffice of Communications, U.S. Energy Information Administration, Feb. 24, 2012', 'https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/e_ertrro_xr0_nus_cm.htm'), ('\nInterview, Frederick Lawrence, a vice president at the Independent Petroleum Association of America, Feb. 24, 2012', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2012/mar/01/barack-obama/obama-says-us-has-record-number-oil-rigs-operating/

Becky Moeller says local Texas chambers of commerce ""were granted sweetheart exemptions from paying all property taxes on their expensive headquarters properties""
","
The president of the Texas AFL-CIO roundly objects to subjecting recipients of unemployment aid to drug tests.

In a Feb. 17, 2012, press release, Becky Moeller said ""some politicians and interest groups want to attack the unemployment system by subjecting workers who lost their jobs through no fault of their own to insulting and costly drug tests."" The release says Moeller was reacting to praise of Congress by Bill Hammond, president of the Texas Association of Business, for including in its extension of unemployment benefits a provision giving states the right to require drug tests of recipients seeking a job that generally requires a drug test, as CNN reported Feb. 17, 2012..
.
Moeller said: ""We continue to wait for legislative proposals to require CEOs who accept corporate welfare and promise jobs that they often don’t deliver to take drug tests. Come to think of it, we’re still waiting for heads of local Chambers of Commerce in Texas who were granted sweetheart exemptions from paying all property taxes on their expensive headquarters properties to take drug tests to prove they are ‘ready and available’ to use  taxpayer money.""

Wham, bam, blooey, and at a glance, nothing but opinion.

But we focused on a clearly factual claim -- that local chambers of commerce got exemptions from paying property taxes on their headquarter properties. Setting aside her juicy adjectives as opinion -- ""sweetheart"" and ""expensive"" -- were local chambers granted exemptions from property taxes?

They were, though we were unable to pin how many chambers have taken advantage and to what cost.

The Greater Austin Area Chamber of Commerce, which in late 2011 confirmed plans to move from leased space to purchased space in downtown Austin, has applied for an exemption that could save the group about $100,000 in 2012 property taxes, a figure based on taxes levied on the property for 2011, the chamber’s president, Mike Rollins, told us in a telephone interview.

Rollins said the Austin chamber did not seek the exemption law but appreciates the result. ""Chambers do a lot of work that if they didn’t do it, the public would have to pay for it out of their ad valorem (property) taxes,"" he said, offering as an example the preparation and distribution of promotional information about the surrounding community.

Rollins added that the Austin chamber has taken no position on the drug-testing law singled out in Moeller’s statement and, he suggested, it’s unfair to insinuate that any local chambers are aligned with the TAB leader’s salute to the law.

So, how did the tax exemptions come to be?

AFL-CIO spokesman Ed Sills, responding to our request for backup information, said the exemptions were authorized by the 2009 Legislature in an amendment to a measure covering other topics.

According to legislative records, on May 27, 2009, state Sen. Mike Jackson, R-La Porte, put the exemption provision into House Bill 770, which as originated by Rep. Donna Howard, D-Austin, had to do with property taxes on a homestead residence rendered uninhabitable by water or mold damage.

Jackson also was named chairman of the Senate side of the joint conference committee that reached a compromise version of HB 770. The measure then cleared the Senate with only Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, voting ""no"" and won House approval 144-0. Gov. Rick Perry let the proposal become law without his signature.

The relevant provision, added to the Texas Tax Code, says that to qualify for the property-tax exemption, a nonprofit economic development group largely funded by dues-paying members must primarily be engaged in one or more of these activities: promoting the common economic interests of commercial enterprises; improving the business conditions of one or more types of business; or otherwise providing services to aid in economic development. It says too the group may not have a political action committee.

Legislators embraced the provision in the face of a fiscal note stating: """"The bill's requirement for mandatory exemptions for qualifying economic development corporation property would create a cost to cities, counties, school districts and the state through the operation of the school finance formulas.""

Specifically, the note says, the change would reduce state revenue by nearly $1.2 million in the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 2011, with the annual reduction increasing to nearly $1.8 million for the year ending Aug. 31, 2014. There’s a state cost, the note says, partly because state law requires the state to ensure that school districts maintain the revenue levels they had in 2006. According to the fiscal note, local cities, counties and school districts would see their combined related revenue drop less than the state’s annual decreases.

We were unable to obtain updated cost projections taking into account actions by the 2011 Legislature changing how the school funding formulas affect state spending.

In a telephone interview, Jackson told us he sought the exemption provision at the behest of a local chamber leader and after learning that about 25 percent of 500 local chambers in the state then owned their headquarters. A Sept. 2, 2010, Houston Chronicle news article credits the executive director of the Texas City-La Marque Chamber of Commerce with leading the statewide push to authorize the property-tax exemption.

Per Moeller’s statement, Jackson said he did not want to give anyone a sweetheart deal but thought that business owners who compose the membership of local chambers already paid property taxes on their properties. Charging property taxes on the chamber HQs, he said, was like double taxation. Also, Jackson said, most chamber headquarters he has seen are ""not big Taj Mahals.""

""The AFL-CIO ought to be all in favor of this,"" Jackson opined. ""This allows these chambers to use that money to help economic development and create more jobs. That would just do more to help labor in general.""

A House version of the chamber-sought change, House Bill 831, drew favorable testimony from leaders of six local chambers of commerce including individuals from Kerrville, Brownsville, Lewisville and La Marque, according to the Texas Legislative Council, with representatives of a dozen additional local chambers registering in favor.

Legislative records show no one testifying against the tax exemption provision.

Sills, of the Texas AFL-CIO, said in a telephone interview that behind the scenes the labor group fought the change. He forwarded an email that he said was sent during the session to House members urging opposition to HB 831.

The 2009 email says chambers of commerce lobby on many issues, sometimes against the interests of a majority of residents. ""If the Legislature wants to allow the public to start subsidizing non-profit organizations that engage in the political process,"" the email says, ""then alternatively we ask you to adopt an amendment that would include labor union organizations in that subsidy. We don’t think it would be great public policy, but it would create a more level playing field. It would be preferable, though, to oppose"" the exemption proposal. ""We believe that taxpayers do not want to subsidize chambers of commerce and other politicized organizations through tax subsidies.""

Ron Paul says Rick Santorum 'opposes right-to-work'
","
In a video ad released Feb. 28, 2012, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, took aim at all three of his remaining rivals in the Republican presidential primary race -- Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. 
In this item, we’ll check the ad’s claim that Santorum ""opposes right-to-work"" -- a policy that ""guarantees that no person can be compelled, as a condition of employment, to join or not to join, nor to pay dues to a labor union,"" as the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation defines it. 
Under the Taft-Hartley Act, passed in 1947, states are authorized to pass such laws, and 23 have done so. (They are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming.) 
Generally speaking, expanding right-to-work laws is popular among Republican primary and caucus voters, so it has become an issue in this year’s primary season. It’s also on the agenda for lawmakers in states such as Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maine, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
During the primary season, Paul has tried to distinguish himself from Santorum over the issue, charging that Santorum has been soft in his support for right-to-work. We should note that the Paul ad uses the present tense when it says Santorum ""opposes right-to-work,"" so Santorum’s current position will be significant in our analysis. 
We began by visiting Santorum’s website. On the site, we found the following under the heading, ""The Truth About Right to Work."" 
""In the Senate, Rick voted to allow states to determine their own right-to-work laws. These laws protect employees from having to join unions in order to work for a company. Today, Rick believes that a National Right-to-Work law is important to curb union abuses and further strengthen the manufacturing sectors of our economy."" 
In addition to what Santorum said on his website, he has also said the following: 
• ""I've already signed a pledge and said I would sign a national right to work bill,"" Santorum said in the CNN debate in South Carolina. After being pressed by moderator John King, Santorum added, ""Well, maybe you didn't hear what I said. I said I would support a national right to work law and sign it into law and would support and advocate for one. "" 
• Speaking on WJR-AM 760 in Detroit, Santorum said he would sign national right-to-work legislation. ""A national right-to-work bill is something that I would be supportive of,"" he said. 
So ""today,"" Santorum says he supports a national right-to-work law. Viewed in isolation, that would seem to make the Paul ad’s claim flat wrong. However, the fact that Santorum felt the need to add a line on his website about his past views suggests that there’s been some fluidity in his position -- and there has been. 
On July 10, 1996, the Senate took a ""cloture"" vote to move toward consideration of the National Right to Work Act of 1995, which, among other things, would have amended the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act to repeal federal provisions that require employees to pay union dues or fees as a condition of employment. 
According to Senate rules, individual senators or groups of senators have the power to stall bills indefinitely through a filibuster. Such blockages can only be broken by a 60-vote supermajority. If 60 senators vote for cloture, the blocked bill may proceed to a vote on its merits. If fewer than 60 senators vote for cloture, the bill remains stalled. 
The cloture vote for the National Right to Work Act of 1995 garnered only 31 yes votes, compared to 68 no votes, meaning that the bill remained blocked. One of those no votes was Santorum’s. So it’s fair to say that Santorum in 1996 helped stop a national right-to-work bill in its tracks. (Santorum was actually one of 20 Republicans who voted no, compared to 31 Republicans who voted yes.) 
Santorum has explained this vote on federalism grounds -- that he didn’t like the idea of Pennsylvania’s long-established laws being overturned by federal decree. 
""When I was a senator from Pennsylvania, which is a state that is not a right-to-work state, the state made a decision not to be right-to-work,"" Santorum said when pressed on the issue during a CNN debate in South Carolina on Jan. 19, 2012. ""And I wasn't going to go to Washington and overturn that from the federal government and do that to the state."" 
The fact that Santorum had to win election in a swing state may also have been a factor: He comes from western Pennsylvania, where it’s common to find socially conservative but pro-labor Democrats willing to cross lines and vote for a Republican. 
Meanwhile, on one occasion -- a Fox News debate in Orlando, Fla., on Sept. 22, 2011 -- Santorum sidestepped a direct question about a national right-to-work law. Santorum focused his answer on assailing public-employee unions, saying he would ""support a bill that says that we should not have public employee unions for the purposes of wages and benefits to be negotiated."" But he did not specifically address the question about his stance on a national right-to-work law. 
Santorum’s explanation of his change in position didn’t cut it with Paul’s campaign. 
""Fact: Rick Santorum voted against it in the United States Senate. End of story,"" Jesse Benton, Paul's national campaign chairman, told PolitiFact. 
Paul’s position also meshes with the ""National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation."" Patrick Semmens, the group’s director of legal information, last month emailed the website BuzzFeed that Santorum's ""position on right-to-work should be deeply troubling to the 80 percent of Americans who believe workers should not be forced to pay dues or fees to a union just to get or keep a job. Not only has he refused to answer the National Right to Work Committee's Presidential Survey, but while in the Senate he joined with Democrats to filibuster the National Right to Work Act."" 
Even so, as we noted before, the Paul ad uses the present tense -- and that clashes with Santorum’s statement, reiterated on several occasions, that he supports a national right-to-work law today. 
Our ruling 
Santorum clearly has a zig-zagging history with his positions on a national right-to-work law. If we’d rated this on the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter, it would likely qualify as a Full Flop. However, the Paul ad states that Santorum ""opposes right-to-work"" -- which means today. Despite his past history, Santorum has stated on several occasions that he would work on behalf of (and if he became president, sign) a national right-to-work law. On balance, we rate the ad’s claim Half True. ","[('\nRon Paul, ""Three of a Kind"" (ad), Feb. 28, 2012\n\nRick Santorum for President, ""The Truth About Rick"" web page, accessed Feb. 29, 2012\n\nCNN, transcript of Republican presidential debate in South Carolina, Jan. 19, 2012\n\nFox News, transcript of Fox News-Google debate in Orlando, Fla., Sept. 22, 2011\n\nNational Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, frequently asked questions page, accessed Feb. 29, 2012\n\nBuzzFeed, ""Is Rick Santorum Really A Union Stooge?""

Cory Booker claims jobless rate fell two percentage points in Newark last year
","
Newark Mayor Cory Booker said his city is doing ""unprecedented things to move forward"" despite wrenching economic circumstances. 
Asked in a radio interview last week about the State of the City address he’ll deliver today, Booker said Newark’s population is rising, development projects are going up downtown and businesses are moving to town. Amid that growth, the mayor also highlighted a trend moving in the opposite direction: the city’s  jobless rate is shrinking, he claimed.

""We've seen in this last year tremendous things happening, including our unemployment rate come down 2 percentage points,"" Booker said on WBGO’s ""Newark Today"" on Feb. 23.

A spokeswoman for the mayor provided data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from January 2011 to December 2011 to support Booker’s claim. During that time frame the unemployment rate in Newark fell from 15.9 percent  to 13.9 percent.

But that comparison has flaws. The data on unemployment rates in New Jersey’s cities are not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations such as holiday and summer hiring. 
Garrett Schmitt, an economist with U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, said for that reason, the agency recommends comparing annual averages or year-over-year data, meaning one month from one year to the same month the next year, when using nonseasonally adjusted data..

The average annual rate for 2011 is not yet available. From December 2010 to December 2011, the most recent month of federal data available, Newark’s unemployment rate fell from 14.6 percent to 13.9 percent, or 0.7 percentage points.

""The Mayor’s statement was 100% true and factually accurate. The unemployment rate in Newark in 2011 fell by 2 percentage points,"" Adam Zipkin, the city’s deputy mayor for economic and housing development, said in a statement. ""This is significant because it is the first time in seven years that Newark has seen the unemployment rate fall within a calendar year by two full percentage points. While experts, economists and others may want to color, shape or contextualize that fact with other statistics over different time periods, it is still a fact. Just as when monthly job and unemployment numbers are reported broadly on national networks, many people will have comments on those facts but the numbers themselves are indisputable.""

It’s worth noting that using the time frame Booker’s office cited, a similar claim about the jobless rate could have been made in 2010. That year, the unemployment rate fell from 16.1 percent in January to 14.6 percent in December.

But the next month, in January 2011, the rate jumped to 15.9 percent. That’s not an isolated incident. Since 2006, the unemployment rate has increased in January from the previous December.

Our ruling

Booker claimed that in the past year, Newark’s unemployment rate fell two percentage points.

A spokeswoman for the Newark mayor cited nonseasonally adjusted federal data from January 2011 to December 2011 to support his claim. Within that time frame, the unemployment rate fell two percentage points. But an economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said his agency recommends comparing year-over-year data or annual averages when using statistics that are not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.

From December 2010 to December of last year, the city’s unemployment rate dropped 0.7 percentage points, not two percentage points.

We rate this claim False.

Marcy Kaptur claims Dennis Kucinich voted 'no' on veterans aid that she supported
","
A 30-second TV ad for Marcy Kaptur aimed a three-point attack at Dennis Kucinich, the fellow incumbent she faces in the Democratic primary for Ohio's new 9th congressional district.

Kucinich opened their recent City Club debate objecting that the ad misrepresented his voting record on job creation, veterans' care and prescription drug benefits for seniors.

PolitiFact Ohio previously looked at the ad’s claim that ""when Marcy Kaptur brought home $42 million for new manufacturing jobs, Dennis Kucinich voted no."" We rated that Half True.

For this analysis, we'll look at the claim: ""When Kaptur helped get $15 billion more for veterans care, Kucinich voted no.""

The ad cites as its source the roll call vote of Dec. 10, 2009, on HR 3288, the omnibus appropriations package called the Consolidated Appropriations Act.

The $447 billion measure, one of eight for fiscal 2010, included spending bills for numerous departments and agencies including the departments of State, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education. It also included funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Congress faced a deadline of Dec. 18 to get the package signed into law to avoid a government shutdown. The House passed it 221 to 202. It had no support from House Republicans. Kaptur voted yes; Kucinich voted no.

Kucinich's campaign told us the congressman explained his opposition to the measure at the time of the vote. He acknowledged support for many of its provisions -- including increased veterans' benefits -- but took exception to other major provisions: ""billions of dollars in military aid, sanctions and funds for policies in the Middle East that undermine the administration's call for a commitment to diplomacy; $239 million in foreign military financing for Pakistan; destabilizing investment and trade sanctions; and restrictions on aid to Gaza and the West Bank.""

Objecting that the Kaptur ad tried to portray Kucinich as ""anti-veteran,"" his campaign cited efforts to fund research to help find causes and treatments for veterans suffering from Gulf War Syndrome.

Kaptur campaign spokesman Steve Fought acknowledged that the omnibus spending bill had ""money in there for the military. But you can't really pick and choose. It was to keep the government funded, and he decided to vote no.

""He wants to have it both ways. He's letting others carry the ball and do the heavy lifting. He keeps talking about Gulf War Syndrome, but he voted against his own provision. He was for the research before he was against it,"" Fought said.

Fought was referring to a provision in HR 2055 that was approved in the House last year.

Kucinich co-sponsored an effort to obtain money specifically for Gulf War illness research. A news release his office issued Dec. 16, 2011, said he and Rep. Michael Michaud, a Maine Democrat, had won $10 million for the Gulf War Veterans' Illness Research Program.

The statement says: ""The funding was included in HR 2055, the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Kucinich won the adoption of an amendment to the Defense Appropriations Act in July to increase the amount of money for GWVIRP by over 25 percent over last year's level.""

But Kucinich voted against HR 2055 when the full measure came up for a vote of the House -- much as he had done with the omnibus measure for 2010. Kaptur voted yes.

The campaign ad claimed that ""when Kaptur helped get $15 billion more for veterans care, Kucinich voted no.""

Kucinich did vote against a bill that contained money for veterans.

We have noted before that legislators frequently face the dilemma of having to vote against programs they would normally support because they are so opposed to other provisions in the same piece of legislation.

And Kucinich's votes on military spending, reflecting his opposition, have been consistent.

Kucinich takes credit for championing a program that he ultimately voted against. His work for the program gives a different impression than his vote. His positions help explain his votes, both on HR 2055 last December and on HR 3288, the prior spending measure cited in the ad.

Those are important pieces of information needed to evaluate the claim.

Are there 395 Oregon prisoners triple-bunked in cells meant for two and housed in classrooms?
","
Oregon’s budget writers tossed around the idea of closing the Santiam Correctional Institution south of Salem to balance the budget. State leaders agreed to leave the prison alone, but that doesn’t mean we can’t fact check a statement made by labor leader Ken Allen in a guest column submitted to The Oregonian.

Allen is executive director of Oregon Council 75 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the union that represents most corrections employees. He said closing the prison would send 440 minimum-security inmates to other prisons, overcrowding an already overcrowded situation.

""We have 395 inmates pushed into triple-bunked cells intended for two inmates and bunked in classrooms and areas supposed to be designated for inmate labor,"" he wrote.

""We have units that were designated for 80 inmates with 120 inmates, with only one corrections officer supervising these inmates. We have units with blind spots, including no sightline to the bathroom, with only one corrections officer supervising 80 to 100 inmates.""

Oh wow. That sounded pretty dire. Was Allen being alarmist? Or are Oregon’s prisons that stuffed? There are lots of details in the column, but we zeroed in on the 395-inmate figure: Are there 395 inmates pushed into triple-bunked cells intended for two people and bunked in classrooms or work spaces?

The Department of Corrections confirmed there are 395 emergency beds currently in use, but the beds are not in standard sized cells meant for two people. Also, those beds are not currently in classroom or work areas, although there were plans to do just that should Santiam close.

""We do not put three inmates into the standard-sized cell,"" said Jennifer Black, a spokeswoman for the agency.

We asked Corrections to break down the location of the 395 beds, and in the process, we learned quite a bit about prison housing in Oregon. Inmates are housed in cells or in open sleeping areas much like camp. A standard-sized cell is about 8 feet by 10 feet, or 80 square feet, and designed to hold two inmates.

Mill Creek: There are 50 emergency beds here, 25 each added to two large dorms.

Columbia River: There are 40 emergency beds, added to different dorm housing units.

Snake River: There are 80 emergency beds scattered among minimum-security and medium-security open dorm rooms.

Deer Ridge: There are 116 emergency beds, divided among four minimum-security dorm units. Each unit used to hold 108 beds; now each unit holds 137 beds.

Eastern Oregon: There are 52 emergency beds, with roughly half in open dorm rooms. The individual rooms at this former mental health facility are larger, which is why you can squeeze in more beds. Eight individual rooms that are 7 feet by 19 feet, or 133 square feet, got a third bed. Eight more rooms that are 7 feet by 24 feet, or 168 square feet, each received two extra beds.

Coffee Creek: There are emergency 57 beds, added to three minimum-custody open dorm areas.  

So that adds up to 395 beds. Nathan Allen, budget and planning administrator for the agency, said he did not know of any of those beds in current classroom or work areas, although such spaces have been converted in the past into housing units.

""It’s inaccurate because none of the 395 meet that picture, that scenario,"" said Guy Hall, administrator of the Office of Population Management.

Next, we turned to AFSCME. Tim Woolery is the union’s staff representative for Corrections. Before that, he was a Corrections employee for 18 years and in that time has seen cots lined up in unimaginable spots when the population ran high.

Woolery said they can’t add any more beds without compromising security or safety. ""We’re at the precipice.""

Still -- and this is important -- Woolery acknowledged that he doesn’t know where the 395 beds are located. Don Loving, spokesman for AFSCME, said he doesn’t know how else to prove the case other than what they’ve seen themselves or what they’ve been told by officers.

""It is hard for us to ‘prove’ some things because the DOC is never going to publicly admit anything that contradicts its official position,"" Loving said.

Are there safety issues? Yes. Adding bunks to units could interfere with the line of sight for guards.

Has Corrections housed inmates in work areas in the past and could it in the future? Yes. Nathan Allen said that the next wave of emergency beds could use classroom space at one of the prisons. Had Santiam closed, one of the options was to put beds into a recreation area at Deer Ridge. At Two Rivers, there is an 88-bed unit in a space that could have been used for work training.

The statement gives the impression that trios of inmates are crammed into tiny cells. That is not true. Allen states that the 395 inmates have spilled into work areas and classroom space. That also is not true, with respect to this batch of 395 beds.

We give Ken Allen and AFSCME credit on the broader issue of inmate housing. Work areas have been converted into housing in the past. The closure of Santiam would have prompted more conversions. There may be more teaching and work space converted to housing in the future. And a handful of beds -- 24 -- were added to rooms that typically house two inmates.

But none of those reasons mitigate the fact that those 395 beds are not located in work areas, and the small number of third and fourth beds are not in cells designed to hold only two people.

Rick Perry says there’s no proven instance of groundwater polluted by fracking
","
Before he suspended his candidacy for president, Texas Gov. Rick Perry gave a spirited defense of fracking, a process that extracts natural gas from thousands of feet underground.

""You cannot show me one place where there is a proven – not one – where there is a proven pollution of groundwater by hydraulic fracking,"" Perry told a college student who raised the topic at a December 18, 2011, stop in Decorah, Iowa, according to the Texas Tribune.

Not one?

Perry’s sweeping claim tracks with the November 2011 release of preliminary findings of a study by the University of Texas Energy Institute. A November 10, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news article quoted the study’s leader, UT geologist Charles ""Chip"" Groat, saying hydraulic fracturing ""doesn’t seem to be of concern to groundwater.""

Groat said the study had looked at regulatory violations and frameworks in states with major shale drilling operations, including Texas, Louisiana, New York and Pennsylvania. ""The violations that we've seen are of no, minor or small impact,"" he said.

Perry’s claim also echoed more than 25 others made by regulatory officials, as compiled by a pro-drilling group, as well as a May 2011 assessment by the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA’s administrator, Lisa Jackson, was asked at a May 24, 2011, hearing of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform whether hydraulic fracturing can affect aquifers and water supplies. Jackson replied: ""There is evidence that it can certainly affect them. I am not aware of any proven case where the fracking process itself has affected water.""

The ""fracking process itself""?

Fracking might be fun to say, but it’s a little slippery to define.

Both Jackson and Perry were using a very specific definition of fracking, their spokeswomen told us by email, referring only to the step in the process where the shale rock is fractured.

In high-pressure hydraulic fracturing for natural gas, a mix of water, sand and chemicals is shot down into the well, bursting out of holes in the pipe lining the well and cracking the gas-bearing shale rock. Gas then flows from the cracks back up the pipe for collection. The immense increase in fracking since the mid-2000s came about because companies began to use this process in horizontally drilled wells, which cost more but also reach more of the layer of shale that lies as deep as two miles below the earth’s surface.

But the energy industry and environmental groups use the term fracking in very different ways.
Fracking expert Terry Engelder, a professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University, mapped out the two positions for us.

""Industry likes to restrict the use of the term hydraulic fracturing to just that process taking place underground during which time high-pressure water opens natural cracks or creates new cracks at the depths of the reservoir rock,"" Engelder told us by email.

Conversely, Engelder said, opponents of drilling ""consider fracking to encompass the entire process from leasing land through drilling and sending natural gas to market.""

PolitiFact Ohio acknowledged as much in a July 14, 2011, article. Evidence supported an Ohio lawmaker’s claim that state agencies had no proof of groundwater contamination from fracking, though the statement was rated Mostly True because in one case, a state panel found that a well’s cement casing allowed gas to seep into water wells (and up into homes, causing an explosion).

Even by the narrow definition, some environmentalists say that EPA reports from 1987 and 2011 prove that fracking has contaminated water.

The 1987 report (unearthed last year by the national nonprofit Environmental Working Group) said that ""residual"" fracking fluid ""migrated"" into a private water well after a nearby gas well had been fractured in West Virginia. The Dec. 8, 2011, preliminary report found fracking was a possible cause of groundwater contamination in Pavilion, Wyo., where a company was fracking inside an aquifer -- an unusual case, according to the report.

EPA spokeswoman Betsaida Alcantara offered us no comment on the 1987 report, though an Aug. 4, 2011, news story by an independent nonprofit news organization, ProPublica, quotes an unidentified EPA official as saying the agency was reviewing that case.

The 2011 report, Alcantara told us, ""tentatively found a link between groundwater contamination in an aquifer with hydraulic fracturing. The report is not final and it will now go through independent scientific review.""

Also using the narrow definition, other regulatory officials said they did not know of groundwater pollution by fracking.

The Texas Railroad Commission regulates fracking in Texas. Commission spokeswoman Gaye Greever McElwain told us, ""Commission records do not indicate a single documented water contamination case associated with the process of hydraulic fracturing in Texas.

Similarly, an official with the National Groundwater Protection Council told us in a telephone interview that fracking has not been proven to contaminate groundwater. Mike Paque, executive director of the council comprising groundwater regulators and oil/gas regulators from state agencies, said the depth at which shale is fractured makes contamination by fracking itself practically impossible.

""There’s no water down there to drink,"" Paque said. ""Private wells go a couple hundred feet down, and these are 11,000 feet down. So the fact that people say that, and that my state regulatory agencies say that, and the drinking water agencies say that, is correct, period.""

To get our own fix on possible water pollution by fracking, we examined lists of incidents that were described as fracking-related by EarthJustice, a nonprofit law firm; the National Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy nonprofit group; and ThinkProgress, a blog run by the American Progress Action Fund, a liberal think-tank.

Because we were seeking ""proven"" groundwater contamination, we first eliminated claims not related to water pollution and accounts that did not include independent evidence, such as a state investigation or newspaper story. Of the remaining 56 claims of groundwater contamination, not a single one fit the ""industry"" definition of fracking -- the one Perry was using, his spokeswoman, Lucy Nashed, told us.

Yet how close to that step in the process were they? We identified 11 incidents that appeared to be both substantiated by outside evidence and linked to an essential part of the process of hydraulically fracturing a well. The 11 included events such as fracking fluid leaking from wastewater pits or from pipe lining a fracked well. Several were ""blowouts,"" which Engelder defined for us as the (normally controlled) process in which ""high pressure gas blows fracking water out of the well to clear the way for natural gas production.""

A few examples: 
The two views of fracking seem irreconcilable.

Jason Pitt, a spokesman for the Sierra Club, told us by email: ""Fracking is just one small part of an overall industrial process to extract natural gas. When speaking about ground water contamination, it is very misleading to refer back to just the fracking process."" He said there are many cases of water contamination ""that have occurred as a result of natural gas extraction across the country.""

Engelder, the Penn State geologist, disagreed. ""Anti-drillers,"" he said, ""have lots of proof of spills and leaks and other stuff including noise pollution and so forth because they consider fracking to be the all-encompassing, creeping industrialization of rural areas.""

Attempts to tie events such as surface spills to hydraulic fracturing miss the point, he said. ""Fracking is such a toxic word in the English language that Americans are blaming all sorts of bad things on it when, in fact, Governor Perry was using the term hydraulic fracturing correctly in his comment.""

Our ruling

Perry’s comment, focused on ""proven"" incidents of groundwater polluted by the specific step of breaking the shale rock, holds up. However, the definition of fracking is debated -- and if we rope in all incidents that take place at such wells, there have been more than a few reported incidents of groundwater contamination.

Rick Santorum ad quotes Mitt Romney distancing himself from NRA
","
Presidential candidate Rick Santorum is running a television ad that uses rival Mitt Romney’s own words against him.

The ad contains no voice-over, only sound effects as Romney’s quotes pop onto the screen against a black background. The first says, ""I don’t line up with the National Rifle Association.""

The NRA wields enormous political power at the state and national levels, and conservative candidates crave its endorsement. It’s startling to see a Republican contender distancing himself from the group, so we decided to delve into the ad’s claim.

Did Romney really say that?

In short, yes, he did. But it was in 1994.

Running for Senate in Massachusetts, Romney criticized his opponent, Democrat Ted Kennedy, for supporting a crime bill in Congress. Romney said Kennedy had worked to expand the cost of the bill while weakening several provisions.

According to a story in the Boston Globe about the issue, Romney stressed that he supported the bill's ban on 19 different types of assault weapons -- which the NRA opposed.

""I don't line up with the NRA,"" Romney said, according to the story.

The quote was not a blanket statement of disagreement with the NRA, as Santorum’s ad could suggest. Rather Romney was talking about a particular issue on which he didn't agree with the NRA's position.

At the time, Romney also voiced support for the Brady Bill, which imposed a five-day waiting period on gun sales. The NRA opposed that bill.

His words since

In 2002, while running for governor, Romney was still talking the gun control talk.

In a debate comment captured in this YouTube video, Romney said, ""We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts. I support them. I won’t chip away at them. I believe they help protect us and provide for our safety.""

In fact, he expanded those protections in the state. In 2004, Gov. Romney signed a permanent ban on assault weapons such as the AK-47 and Uzi. The NRA called the law ""ineffective and unnecessary.""

By 2007, when he was making his first run for president, Romney’s tone had begun to change.

The Globe reported on his shift in rhetoric:

""He now touts his work as governor to ease restrictions on gun owners. He proudly describes himself as a member of the NRA -- though his campaign won't say when he joined. And Friday, at his campaign's request, top officials of the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation led him around one of the country's biggest gun shows.

""Romney says he still backs the ban on assault weapons, but he won't say whether he stands by the Brady Bill. And after the gun show tour, his campaign declined to say whether he would still describe himself as a supporter of tough gun laws.""

The Globe later reported that Romney admitted to joining the NRA in August, 2006, just months before announcing his presidential candidacy.

At the time his campaign touted his pro-gun efforts as governor, including his signing of an NRA-backed bill that reduced a testing requirement on certain pistol-makers before they could sell guns in Massachusetts and his designation of May 7, 2005, as ""The Right to Bear Arms Day"" in Massachusetts to honor ""the right of decent, law-abiding citizens to own and use firearms in defense of their families, persons, and property and for all lawful purposes, including the common defense.""

The best evidence we found on the matter comes from a 2007 interview Romney gave on Meet the Press. Host Tim Russert confronted Romney with his quotes from 1994 and asked him to explain.

Romney said, ""My position on guns is the same position I’ve had for a long, long time. That position is that I don’t line up a hundred percent with the NRA. I don’t see eye to eye with the NRA on every issue.""

He said he still supported banning weapons that are ""unusually lethal"" but hedged on waiting periods. He said the Brady Bill originally included a waiting period because the time was necessary for performing background checks. Now that technology enables instant background checks, such waiting periods are unnecessary, he said. Then he spoke a bit about Second Amendment rights.

""We should not interfere with the right of law-abiding citizens to own guns, either for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful purpose. I support the work of the NRA, I’m a member of the NRA. But do we line up on every issue? No, we don’t,"" he told Russert.

The 2012 campaign

Romney didn’t attend the NRA’s national convention in 2011 in Pittsburgh and instead sent a videotaped message. He said nothing about gun rights. He offered congratulations to the organization and its leaders for their work defending the Constitution and criticized political leaders who would expand the reach of government.

""I believe in America. I believe in free enterprise,"" he said.

Romney’s campaign website has a section devoted to gun rights. It does not mention the NRA or the Massachusetts ban on assault weapons he signed as governor. Instead, it touts his work on behalf of gun owners, including extending the terms of gun licenses in Massachusetts and making replacement licenses free.

""As president, Mitt will work to expand and enhance access and opportunities for Americans to hunt, shoot, and protect their families, homes and property, and he will fight the battle on all fronts to protect and promote the Second Amendment,"" the website says.

We contacted the NRA for this story but didn’t hear back. The group has not endorsed any primary candidate -- which isn’t unusual. It didn’t announce its backing of John McCain in the last election until October of 2008. But the group has made clear its goal is to defeat President Barack Obama.

Christopher Cox, the NRA’s chief lobbyist told Fox Business Network anchor Lou Dobbs in February 2012 that ""any of these (Republican) candidates would be a lot better than this president. ... So we take any of them over this guy.""

Our ruling

Santorum’s ad flashes a quote from Romney saying ""I don’t line up with the National Rifle Association.""

The quote is accurate, though it omits the fact that Romney spoke those words 18 years ago and used them to describe his position on a single issue. Romney clearly has shifted his position on the issue of gun rights to align himself more closely with the NRA. For one thing, he became a member. And in campaigns subsequent to that 1994 senatorial bid, he has emphasized his work in favor of gun ownership rather than on tightening laws.

But when Romney addressed the issue in 2007, he did not contradict what he said in 1994. ""I support the work of the NRA, I’m a member of the NRA. But do we line up on every issue? No, we don’t,"" he told Tim Russert. What else? He signed an assault weapons ban opposed by the NRA as Massachusetts governor.

NRCC ad blames Barack Obama for food stamp use rising by 13,000 a day
","
A recent ad by the National Republican Congressional Committee -- the House Republicans’ campaign arm -- offers a flurry of statistics to argue that President Barack Obama doesn’t deserve a second term.

""What's become of America since President Obama took full control of Washington?"" the narrator says. ""A wrecked economy, with debt and waste beyond imagination. Since then, gas prices have gone up more than 82 percent. Every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost. Every day, another 2,700 of us realize it's been six months since we last had a job. Every day, more than 6,000 of us have begun living below poverty, while 13,000 more have been put on food stamps, and more than 800 have become uninsured. … This is the legacy President Obama and his Democrats have left for us. If we give them more time, what else will they do to America?""

There’s a lot to digest here, but we’re going to look at two claims from the ad. In another item, we examined the claim that ""since President Obama took full control of Washington ... every single day, more than 1,500 of our jobs have been lost."" The one we’re looking at in this item is, ""Since President Obama took full control of Washington,"" every day, 13,000 more people ""have been put on food stamps.""

We’ll start by noting that ""food stamps"" -- which provide qualifying, low-income Americans with vouchers to buy groceries -- have officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008, although many people still use the informal name.

Also, for the purposes of this fact check, we won’t be checking whether literally 13,000 people joined the food stamp rolls each and every day. Instead, we’ll be looking at the average rate of Americans joining food stamps over the course of the full three-year period to see whether that number is close to 13,000.

As we do with claims like this, we split our analysis into two parts. Are the numbers right? And is it fair to assess either credit or blame for those numbers to the target of the ad?

First, the numbers.

Obama took office on January 20, 2009, so we’ll look at the numbers for both January 2009 and February 2009. In January 2009, there were 31,983,716 Americans receiving food stamp benefits. In February 2009, the number was 32,332,622.

Fast-forward to the most recent month for which data was available when the ad was made -- November 2011 -- and the number of Americans then receiving food stamp benefits was 46,224,775. That means an increase of either 14,241,059 (if you use the January statistic) or 13,892,153 (if you use the February figure).

Assuming that three years means 1,095 days -- or 365 times 3 -- then the number of additional food stamp recipients per day of the Obama presidency was either 13,005 (using the January figure) or 12,687 (using the February figure). We consider either calculation to be fairly represented by the ad’s rounded-off estimate of 13,000.

So the ad is right on the numbers. What about the question of whether Obama deserves the blame?

The NRCC stands by its ad. ""Leadership means taking responsibility, and President Obama bears responsibility for the consequences of his policies,"" said NRCC spokesman Nat Sillin.

Clearly, the rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the most recent recession, which began more than a year before Obama took office. It’s impossible to know how high SNAP usage would have gone had the Republicans, rather than Obama, shaped policy in 2009 and 2010.

On the one hand, SNAP usage has continued to climb almost every month of the Obama presidency despite some signs of an economic recovery.

On the other hand, there is typically a lag before an upturn in the broader economy begins to show up in decreased SNAP usage. The previous high from 1994, for instance, came following a recession that officially ended in mid 1991 -- and that recession was much milder than the most recent one. This makes it harder to assign blame.

In addition to being influenced by the business cycle, enrollment and spending on means-tested programs such as food stamps is ""quite sensitive to political decisions by Congress, state lawmakers, and state and local administrative agencies,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.

Indeed, the number of food stamp beneficiaries rose under President George W. Bush, partly because of more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits and partly because of rules changes that had the effect of broadening eligibility. The experts we spoke to agreed that both policies began under Bush but were retained by Obama.

The changes produced consistent increases in the number of average monthly beneficiaries. The number rose in seven out of the eight years of Bush’s presidency (the final two years of which had Congress under Democratic control). All told, the number of recipients rose by a cumulative 63 percent during Bush’s eight-year presidency, and the number of additional recipients per day during Bush’s eight years was 5,538 -- well below Obama’s rate, but still going up consistently during a period when the economy was relatively healthy.

We should also note that this ad uses the formulation, ""since President Obama took full control of Washington."" Obama -- or at least the Democrats -- can be said to have had full control of Washington, at least on a nominal basis, for two of those three years. But after the Republicans took over the House beginning in January 2011, they have had a share of the control as well.

Our ruling

The NRCC ad is right on the number of additional Americans using food stamps during Obama’s time in office. But it’s wrong to suggest that Obama’s ""full control of Washington"" -- to the extent he even had full control -- was to blame. The broader economic cycle and changes in how the program is administered have had a major impact as well. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.","[('\nNational Republican Congressional Committee, ""Every Day of Democrats,"" Jan. 24, 2012\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service, monthly statistics for participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Oct. 2007 to Oct. 2011\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\nU.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service, annual statistics for participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, 1969 to 2011\n\nPolitiFact, ""Newt Gingrich says ‘more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history,’ "" Jan. 17, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Gary Burtless, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, Feb. 28, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Nat Sillin, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, Feb. 28, 2012', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_profilepage&v=X9b5Z2Y40Vw')]",/factchecks/2012/feb/29/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-ad-blames-barack-obama-food-stamp-use-rising-/

Mitt Romney ad says Rick Santorum endorsed Arlen Specter twice
","
Mitt Romney’s campaign would like primary voters to remember that rival Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum once supported a ""liberal, pro-choice Republican turned Democrat.""

A February 2012 attack ad focuses on Santorum’s relationship with former Sen. Arlen Specter,  the fellow Pennsylvanian he served with for 16 years in Congress.

The ad, titled, ""Arlen and Rick,"" says:
  
Meet Arlen Specter: Liberal, pro-choice Republican turned Democrat. The deciding vote on Obamacare. Rick Santorum supported Specter over conservative candidates — twice. (Santorum clip:) ""I'm proud to endorse Arlen Specter."" Santorum and Specter voted for liberal circuit judge Sonia Sotomayor. Santorum and Specter both sided with Big Labor, against right-to-work. If Rick Santorum couldn't say no to liberal Arlen Specter, can you really trust him to change Washington? 
A description of the ad on the Romney campaign’s YouTube channel says, ""In 1996 and 2004, Rick Santorum supported Arlen Specter over conservative candidates.""

We decided we’d dig back 16 years to check: Did Santorum support Specter over conservative candidates twice?

We reached out to campaigns for Romney and Santorum, in addition to Specter, now adjunct faculty at University of Pennsylvania Law School. None responded by our deadline. But there was plenty written as history unfolded to help us judge this claim.

Santorum’s 1996 endorsement

The first flashback takes us to the mid '90s, when Sen. Arlen Specter, 65, hopped briefly into the Republican race for president.

Santorum, 37, was a freshly minted senator, elected in 1994 with a helping hand from Specter — who swallowed his opposition to the conservative, pro-life House member to ensure a Republican win over Democratic Sen. Harris Wofford.

""It wasn't like Arlen wanted Rick. He didn't. But when he won the primary, he rallied around him,"" said Terry Madonna, an expert in Pennsylvania politics with Franklin and Marshall College.

In 1995, as the junior senator from Pennsylvania, Santorum returned the favor, appearing on stage supporting his home-state colleague while Specter announced his candidacy for president.

(So, the ""1996"" endorsement was in 1995, but for Specter’s short-lived attempt to face Bill Clinton in the 1996 presidential race.)

Did Santorum support Specter ""over conservative candidates""?

According to news coverage at the time, Specter said he was entering the race to challenge the party’s religious conservatives and speak in favor of abortion rights. He attacked conservative primary rivals during his speech — conservative commentator Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed, leaders of the Christian Coalition —  with Santorum on stage.

The New York Times said, ""So pronounced was Mr. Specter's attack that he spoke this line twice: ‘Neither this nation nor this party can afford a Republican candidate so captive to the demands of the intolerant right that we end up re-electing a president of the incompetent left.’""

Santorum, for his part, didn’t play his supporting role flawlessly. The Times reporter noted that he ""rolled his eyes more than once and limited his applause.""

A few days later, Santorum was quoted by States News Service: 
Santorum repeated his support of Sen. Arlen Specter's presidential candidacy, but it was hardly a ringing endorsement. 
""The reason I endorse Sen. Specter is because I work with him everyday,"" Santorum said. He then added, ""and I think we agree on most things."" 

Santorum’s 2004 endorsement

Santorum’s second endorsement of Specter was more recent — and has a more infamous — history.

A Washington Post blog recently called it ""Rick Santorum’s greatest sin.""

Conservative Pat Toomey challenged Specter in the GOP primary. Republican leadership, fearing Toomey would struggle in a general election, lined up behind centrist Specter, starting with President George W. Bush.

Santorum, who by 2004 ranked No. 3 in the Senate as the Republican Conference chairman — a job focused on keeping Republican seats — toed the line. With conservative backing, Specter just survived, keeping his Senate seat one more term.

However, Santorum opposed Specter in other ways, such as in Senate votes over social issues. In 2004, Specter’s voting record got just a 43 percent approval rating from the American Conservative Union, the Bulletin News’ Frontrunner report noted. In 2010, Santorum’s lifetime ACU rating was 88 percent, according to National Review.

""On social stuff, he and Arlen were on very different planets,"" said Madonna, the Pennsylvania politics expert.

In fact, most coverage of Santorum’s endorsement of Specter noted how their politics differed.

For example, a 2004 Campaign & Elections article headlined, ""The Power of Endorsements,"" noted: ""Specter was helped by the endorsement of Santorum, his Senate colleague who is considerably more conservative. The men differed over abortion and stem cell research, among other issues. Santorum played down the differences in backing the incumbent and emphasized their agreement on judicial nominations and other issues. In a television commercial Santorum said, ‘I've heard people say they think Arlen Specter is a liberal. Well, let me tell you. . . Arlen is with us on the votes that matter.’""

During the six-year term won with help from Bush and Santorum, Specter switched his party allegiance and began to caucus with Democrats. Although the ad describes Specter as a  ""liberal, pro-choice Republican turned Democrat,"" Santorum's endorsements of Specter all occurred when Specter was a Republican.

In 2010, Specter ran as a Democrat, and lost in the primary.

Our ruling

Romney’s ad says Santorum ""supported Specter over conservative candidates twice."" It’s true that Santorum endorsed his Pennsylvania colleague in 1995 and 2004 over more conservative primary challengers.

George LeMieux says Connie Mack “failed to pay his child support”
","
Judging from his latest Web ad, George LeMieux thinks his rival for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate is a loser on par with Hollywood bad boy Charlie Sheen.

The ad parodies ""Two and a Half Men"" -- the show Sheen infamously quit in a snit -- to target U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, whom the ad mockingly calls ""Half Mack.""  
In the ad, we see an animated ""Half Mack"" in a series of buffoonish outfits as the ad makes its stinging charges:

""Connie the fourth took seven and a half-years to finish college. … Drunken Brawls. … Arrested. … Road rage. … His only real job in the real world? An 'events coordinator' for Hooters!

""In Congress, Half Mack bounced checks, didn’t pay bills, was sued by his Yacht club, stiffed his lawyer, even failed to pay his child support.""

There’s a lot of claims in that ad, and viewers can find background about much of it in a Miami Herald article that examined Mack’s past. We’ll be looking at a number of these claims in the days ahead.

In this item, we will tackle the serious charge that Mack ""failed to pay his child support."" The ad shows many notices sailing by, each stamped ""urgent,"" ""overdue,"" or ""past due.""

Mack (whose real name is Cornelius Harvey McGillicuddy IV) filed for divorce from his wife Ann McGillicuddy in August 2005 in Lee County Court. On July 12, 2006, the lawyer for the congressman filed a response to his estranged wife’s motion for contempt. The document states that Mack agreed to pay $1,700 a month in temporary support to his estranged wife starting May 1, 2006. His annual congressional salary in 2005 was $162,100, the Herald reported.

That payment was apparently late. When we asked LeMieux’s campaign for evidence, they referred us to a court document from Mack’s divorce posted on the Herald’s website showing a single late payment in connection with the $1,700.

The court record filed by Mack’s attorney showed he transferred $400 to Ann’s account July 3 while on vacation. Once he realized he made a mistake, according to the court filing, he transferred $1,000 on July 10, $164.49 on July 11, and $135.51 on July 12, as well as $175 on July 12 to cover any returned checks.

We should note that the document said ""temporary support"" and ""temporary alimony,"" and not child support, though news reports from the time indicated Mack had two children ages 3 and 5.

The LeMieux campaign said the money should count as child support. ""Financial support of the children is part of family support, and Connie Mack did not make the payment on time,"" LeMieux spokeswoman Anna Nix said in an email.

Mack campaign spokesman David James said this was an alimony payment -- not child support.

James told PolitiFact that the divorce wasn’t final on the dates in question, and negotiations were still ongoing. ""The terminology of ‘late’ is one attorney’s interpretation of the facts.""

We were unable to reach Mack’s ex-wife or her attorney. We did speak with Carolyn Swift, the congressman’s attorney. She said the document the Herald posted specifically referred to the $1,700 that was agreed upon for temporary alimony, in addition to him paying other expenses, including the mortgage on their Virginia residence.

Swift sent us a copy of a May 2006 agreed-upon order that described the $1,700 payment as ""temporary alimony.""

The marital settlement agreement filed in late July said that the congressman would pay the mortgage in lieu of child support until the home was sold, Swift said. An addendum in 2007 set child support at $1,645 a month.

Our ruling

LeMieux’s ad said that Mack ""failed to pay his child support,"" and the visuals of multiple ""past due"" notices suggest a pattern.

LeMieux can’t prove that charge, though. Instead, LeMieux points to a court document that showed Mack was once 12 days late in paying for part of a $1,700 ""temporary alimony"" payment. LeMieux’s campaign argued that Mack’s late alimony payment could have been used to pay for their children’s expenses.

We think saying that Mack ""failed"" to pay his child support is quite a stretch. It’s based on a single partial late payment of less than two weeks, and the payment was classified as alimony by the courts. We rate this claim False.

Newt Gingrich says Rick Santorum sided with union interests over FedEx
","
Newt Gingrich, in Nashville on Monday, cast his opponent, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, as a ""Big Labor Republican,"" the kind of apparent oxymoron that tends to catch our attention. He did it in the context of an historic 1996 showdown in the U.S. Senate, when FedEx was seeking to guarantee that its truck drivers would remain under the jurisdiction of the Railway Labor Act. Any change in that jurisdiction threatened the possibility that drivers could organize local collective bargaining units at FedEx operations.

Specifically, Gingrich said: ""He voted for the unions over FedEx. I suspect most folks in the state don’t know that. But in fact he was a big labor Republican in Pennsylvania and I suspect when you get to Memphis and you say to people, ‘Gee, this is a guy who wanted to guarantee that FedEx give in to the unions,’ Santorum won’t be as popular the following morning.""

Popular or not, there is a legislative history of what happened. We asked Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond for additional supportive evidence of Santorum’s pro-labor, anti-FedEx position after he forwarded an Associated Press story about Gingrich’s remarks. In response to that request, Hammond emailed: ""Look up the vote!""

We took that to mean Gingrich was basing this line of attack on an October 1996 skirmish over a provision FedEx wanted. There were three votes of significance, and they paint a mixed picture of Santorum's position on FedEx.

The issue at the time was the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization act. It had passed both the House and Senate, but then emerged from a House-Senate conference committee with a new labor provision, one favorable to FedEx, that had not been in either the House or Senate versions of the bill. It had been inserted by conference committee member Sen. Ernest Hollings, Republican of South Carolina.

When it came to the Senate floor, several senators, but especially Edward Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked that the FedEx provision, Sec. 1223 of the bill, be ruled outside the scope of the conference committee’s authority under Senate Rule 28. The chair then ruled the provision was, in fact, extraneous.

Next the Senate took up the issue of cloture – whether to cut off debate on the reauthorization act (not just the provision) and proceed to the substantive vote. Santorum joined Kennedy and fellow Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Alan Specter in voting not to invoke cloture -- in other words, to continue debate (some bills and acts never even get an up or down vote if enough senators refuse to end debate on it). That arguably was against FedEx’s interest, though very indirectly, and the tally was 66-31 -- Santorum’s side lost by six votes (cloture requires a three-fifths majority).

Next the Senate took up whether to sustain the ruling of the chair that Sec. 1223 -- the FedEx provision -- was beyond the scope of the conference committee’s authority. On this, Santorum voted in favor of the ruling of the chair – arguably, against FedEx’s interest – but the chair’s ruling was easily overturned, 39-56. Again, Santorum voted with Kennedy and Specter, and lost.

Finally, when the bill itself came up for a vote, with the FedEx provision intact, Santorum voted for it. The vote was 92-2. Only Specter and Paul Simon of Illinois voted against it.

We are not making a ruling here on whether Santorum was a ""Big Labor Republican"" senator but thought we’d get the thoughts of the ""Big Labor"" voice with the most to win or lose in this 1996 struggle – The International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Did the Teamsters consider Santorum a ""Big Labor Republican?""

""Absolutely not,"" said director of communications Bret Caldwell. ""Any vote that he had that might have been in favor of labor would likely have been cast for other reasons. We worked very hard, successfully, to defeat him six years ago, and we would never consider Santorum as a friend of labor.""

Asked specifically about Santorum’s votes in favor of the ruling of the Senate chair and on cloture, which seemed to side with the pro-labor faction, Caldwell said: ""The question is whether he was with labor or with (FedEx rival) UPS as a corporation. His reasonings for that vote we’re not certain at this point, 16 years on, but there’s other reasons for him to vote the way he did. We certainly don’t think it gave him any further credibility with the Teamsters union.""

Caldwell acknowledges that on the initial procedural votes, Santorum’s were ""the right votes."" But ""do we think he made those votes because of his relationship with labor? Absolutely not.""

Our ruling

Santorum took three votes on the 1996 FAA reauthorization act, all three of some interest to FedEx, and Gingrich is correct that on the one vote with a direct connection to the provision FedEx wanted, Santorum voted against its wishes. However, Santorum voted for the entire FAA reauthorization act, and the union with the most to gain in the procedural brouhaha with FedEx does not believe Santorum’s vote had anything to do with supporting the labor cause.
