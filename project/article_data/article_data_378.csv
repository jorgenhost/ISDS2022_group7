Chris Christie claims 31 former Abbott districts receive 70 percent of the state aid
","
Staring at his audience, Gov. Chris Christie took a long pause after delivering this sobering statistic about how schools are funded in New Jersey: 70 percent of the state aid lands in 31 so-called Abbott districts.

During his Nov. 18 visit to the University of Notre Dame, the Republican governor explained how a court decision has delivered most of the state’s education dollars to 31 low-income, urban districts, formerly known as Abbott districts.

""The same way that the Abbott decision in New Jersey, which said that we must give 31 failing districts (a) disproportionate amount of the state aid has not solved the problem either,"" Christie said. ""We now give 31 districts in New Jersey, out of 588 school districts, we give 31 districts 70 percent of the aid.""

PolitiFact New Jersey determined Christie’s funding statistic is mostly accurate.

Between K-12 education aid and preschool aid for the 2011-12 school year, the 31 former Abbott districts — including towns such as Hoboken and Phillipsburg — are set to receive about 60 percent of the aid, according to our analysis of figures on the New Jersey Department of Education’s website.

Christie also was slightly off on the number of school districts. There are 590 districts operating school buildings, and 15 others that send students to other districts without operating their own facilities, according to the state Department of Education.

Justin Barra, an Education Department spokesman, confirmed our analysis of the percentage of aid dollars going to the former Abbott districts.

""The Governor made the point in his speech to Notre Dame that a very small percentage of districts in New Jersey receive a majority of state aid, which is undeniably true,"" Barra said in an e-mail.

Here’s a quick history lesson about the former Abbott districts:

In a legal battle stretching about 30 years, the Abbott vs. Burke court decisions have ensured greater state funding for certain districts as a way of addressing disparities between poor urban areas and the wealthier suburbs. The Abbott designation itself was effectively eliminated a few years ago when the new school funding formula was instituted.

The New Jersey Supreme Court issued the most recent decision in May, ordering the Christie administration to increase state funding to the former Abbott districts by nearly $500 million.

With that additional funding, the 31 former Abbott districts are slated to receive a total of about $4.4 billion in K-12 state aid in the 2011-12 school year. That’s about 57.6 percent of the roughly $7.6 billion in total K-12 aid.

Among the former Abbott districts, Newark is to receive the largest K-12 aid award at about $714 million, followed by Jersey City with about $417 million; Paterson with roughly $398 million; and Elizabeth with about $356 million.

The 31 districts also are set to receive 92 percent of the state’s preschool aid during the current school year, totaling about $569 million.

So, between the K-12 aid and the preschool aid, the former Abbott districts are to receive about 60 percent of the state aid in New Jersey.

Here’s the breakdown of our analysis for each former Abbott district: 
  
It’s worth noting that although the districts only represent about 5 percent of all school districts in New Jersey, they educated nearly 20 percent, or one-fifth, of students during the 2010-11 school year.

Our ruling

At the University of Notre Dame, Christie claimed ""we give 31 (former Abbott) districts 70 percent of the aid.""

The governor wasn’t too far off. Between K-12 aid and preschool aid, the former Abbott districts are slated to receive about 60 percent of the state dollars allocated in the 2011-12 school year. We rate the statement Mostly True.

Jim Jordan chides Obama savings plan as deficit relocation, rather than deficit reduction
","
If you cut out cigarettes and coffee but used the money to pay for a vacation, would you really be saving money? What if you used the savings to pay for upcoming veterinary bills for your dog? Or to pay for your child’s school supplies?

What if this still left you deeply in debt?

These questions, though hypothetical, apply to the federal government. President Obama announced on Nov. 9 that he was ordering federal departments and agencies to cut wasteful spending on cell phones, promotional plaques and other items by $4 billion.  In other words, the federal government was going to save $4 billion a year by cutting out swag. Right?

Wrong, said U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, a Republican from Urbana, Ohio. Jordan is chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of fiscal conservatives in the House of Representatives, and on Nov. 13 he wrote  a guest column in USA Today saying that the nation’s $1 trillion annual deficits and $15 trillion debt require actual spending cuts, not illusory ones.

His focus was on the then-functioning Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, better known as the ""supercommittee,"" which ultimately failed to unite around tax hikes, spending cuts or any other solution to bring deficits under control. But in making his point, Jordan said: ""President Obama's recent plan to cut $100 million of waste within his administration won't actually save money because he's going to spend it elsewhere.""

This claim intrigued PolitiFact Ohio because of the hoopla surrounding Obama’s announcement on Nov. 9 that federal agencies would be smarter about how they spend money internally. This was the latest step in an ongoing White House ""Campaign to Cut Waste,"" which more broadly includes such steps as cutting Medicare payment errors, selling unneeded federal buildings and using the Internet rather than government printing presses and paper to distribute documents such as the Federal Register, which many people read online.

Jordan, too, wants to cut government waste, although his view of government waste is more sweeping than many Democrats’. Still, he said after the recent announcement on cell phones and travel, all the White House was really doing was cutting some areas of spending in order to use the money for other spending. He called it ""deficit relocation, not deficit reduction.""

News reports from the New York Times and USA Today, among others, supported that view.

In the words of a USA Today report from Nov. 9, ""It turns out President Obama's latest effort to cut government waste isn't forecast to save any money. Instead, federal departments and agencies that take the president up on his mandate to shave 20% from certain categories of spending will be free to use the savings elsewhere.""

Reported the New York Times: ""In fact, the administration said, only a small portion of the $4 billion in annual savings will go toward reducing the deficit. Rather, the money will be spent on other programs, like helping veterans re-enter the work force or improving the nation’s infrastructure, which the White House contends are more worthwhile.""

The headline on that story was, ""Obama cuts $4 billion, then uses it elsewhere.""

Jordan’s spokeswoman, Meghan Snyder, cited the USA Today story when we asked about her boss’s claim. We noted that the savings were reported as $4 billion, not the $100 million her boss had said, and she said in a return email: ""The federal government is on a path toward bankruptcy.  In response, the administration wants to move money from one program to another, and call it a 'cut.'  Then, to find out the problem is actually 40 times bigger than was previously reported, makes it even worse.""

But is it really that clear? Obama does intend to cut. He also intends to put the money from the cuts into what he considers higher priorities for the federal government. As USA Today put it, ""the estimated savings -- $4 billion -- can be saved but can also be plowed back into more effective programs.""

So how do you define savings in such a context?

We ran this by Eugene Steuerle, a longtime Treasury Department official who was a deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis under President Reagan. Steuerle, a co-founder of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, was not familiar with the fine details of Obama’s waste-cutting plan, but said it sounded as if there could be savings on cell phones (unless it results in $100-an-hour employees wasting their time at a phone booth because their cell phones have been taken away). But that doesn’t mean there will be savings to the federal budget, or a reduction in the number of bonds the government must sell to keep operating.

It depends, in other words, on definitions. If you’re throwing money in the ocean and you stop doing that, you are saving money that you used to throw away, Steuerle said. Perhaps you’ll spend it on food, which may be good. But what, he asks, if you spend it on beer?

We are tempted to split the baby rather than get totally philosophical. We turned to Webster’s, and the dictionary was somewhat helpful; it defined saving as the act of economizing. In that case, the Obama administration is going to economize, or save -- on cell phones and swag, at least.

But in the view of Jordan and many other Republicans, it is not going to use the savings to reduce overall government spending. Instead, it is going to use the cigarette and ocean money for a vacation, for the dog, for food and, in some views, for a little beer. Whether the government spends money well or needs a starvation diet is not the issue here.

Jordan’s point was clear, and we do not think he was trying to be cute or clever. He made his statement amid a national and unfinished conversation about taxes, spending and the size of government.

But his statement needs clarification, partly because his figure was off -- although that does not affect his overall point -- and also because the concept of saving money can be qualified differently for other purposes.

That’s why we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/dec/01/jim-jordan/jim-jordan-chides-obama-savings-plan-deficit-reloc/

R.I. Rep. Lisa Baldelli-Hunt says tax return data shows that 85 percent of Rhode Islanders earn less than $30,000 per year
","
One of the unsuccessful amendments proposed during the General Assembly's debate on changing the pension system for state workers called for calculating pension benefits using the average pay over the last 10 years of employment, not the last three or five years.

The sponsor, Rep. Lisa Baldelli-Hunt, a Woonsocket Democrat, said the measure would prevent last-minute raises from bumping up a person's pension benefits. Taxpayers, she said, can't afford such largess.

""I'm going to give you a little fact that I was given by the general treasurer, which was pretty astonishing, and that is that 85 percent . . . of Rhode Island tax returns that were filed for the year 2010 . . . were from individuals who earned $30,000 or less. Only 15 percent of Rhode Islanders filed tax returns and earned more than $30,000,"" she said during the debate on the House floor.

That's a lot of people making a very modest income -- in fact, in Baldelli-Hunt’s words, it's a ""pretty astonishing"" number.

It was astonishing -- and worthy of more careful checking than Baldelli-Hunt undertook.

It turns out Baldelli-Hunt was never directly told that 85 percent of Rhode Islanders make $30,000 or less. She said she calculated that percentage based on what she was told during an Oct. 31 meeting with General Treasurer Gina Raimondo and two members of her staff.

As Baldelli-Hunt recalled the meeting, Raimondo said well over 400,000 tax returns filed for the 2010 tax year reported incomes of $30,000 or less. The state representative said Raimondo's number was either 468,000 or 486,000. (She would use the lower, more conservative, number in her calculation.)

Baldelli-Hunt said a financial consultant who was with her at the meeting also recalls a number of over 400,000 and ""we nearly fell off our seats when we heard that, and that put in perspective how Rhode Islanders are struggling.""

On Nov. 17, when the pension proposal was being debated, Baldelli-Hunt took that number and divided it by 554,870, a number her financial consultant pulled off the Internet that was supposed to represent the number of 2010 tax returns filed with the state.

The calculation gives you 84.3 percent.

That’s how she arrived at her 85-percent figure.

First of all, 554,870 is not the number of 2010 tax returns. It’s actually the number of 2009 returns filed by early June of 2010. Also, it includes the returns of people who don’t live in Rhode Island.

When we called Raimondo's office and also Paul Dion, chief of the state's Office of Revenue Analysis, they referred us to the final report on resident income tax returns for the tax year 2009. Both said it was the most recent data that breaks down the returns by income category.

That report paints a very different picture.

It says the state received 483,392 returns from Rhode Island residents that year, with 230,289 reporting incomes of less than $30,000.

That's 48 percent, not 85 percent.

We were curious whether it made a difference to include the tax returns of non-residents, including people who live out of the state but who file here because they work here. Of the 91,231 non-residents who filed in 2009, 27,818 earned under $30,000. Folding those number into the mix brought the percentage down to 45 percent.

Baldelli-Hunt said she is sure of what she heard from the treasurer. Perhaps, she speculated, when Raimondo was looking at the number of returns reporting income of less than $30,000, her eye mistakenly jumped one column to the left, to the 483,392 number, which is the total number of returns.

The correct percentage -- 48 percent -- still means that ""half of working people in the state make $30,000 or less,"" she said. ""It's almost shocking.""

Raimondo spokesman Joy Fox, who was not at the meeting, said the treasurer always uses the 2009 statistics and no one can recall giving Baldelli-Hunt different information.

Our ruling

We can't say whether Baldelli-Hunt is accurately recalling something she heard from Raimondo. There is no audio recording of the meeting.

We can only rule on the accuracy of Baldelli-Hunt's statement when she said that 85 percent of Rhode Island tax returns, filed for the 2010 tax year, reported income of $30,000 or less.

The most-recent income data, from 2009, show that the ratio is 48 percent, far less than what she stated. (The state isn't scheduled to release an income breakdown of its 2010 returns until sometime around March 2012.)

That 48 percent turns out to be fairly typical.

State reports from 2005-2008 show that the percentage doesn't change much year to year, so it seems extraordinarily unlikely that even when the 2010 tax return numbers come out, the percentage will jump to anything close to 85 percent.

Carl Sagan, the late astronomer, liked to say that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. We agree.

Baldelli-Hunt described the statistic was ""pretty astonishing."" It would have served her well to double-check it before using it during debate on the biggest issue to come before the General Assembly this year.

Her assertion that 85 percent of tax returns report income of $30,000 or less -- based on a hasty calculation --  is not only false but ridiculous, we rule her statement Pants on Fire.

"['Income', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says members of Congress with half their pay would still make $38,000 more than typical family
","
As part of his ""uproot and overhaul Washington"" plan, Texas Gov. Rick Perry wants to make Congress look more like the Texas Legislature by transforming it into a ""part-time"" body whose members hold regular jobs. He also wants to halve member salaries. 
A day after unveiling the proposals, Perry wrote a letter to U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, saying that ""no one can truly believe that Americans are satisfied with business as usual"" in the nation’s capital. 
""A part-time Congress with half the pay would still make $38,000 a year more than the average American family,"" Perry wrote in the Nov. 16, 2011, letter. ""Do you truly oppose lawmakers spending more time in their districts? Is it so important for the Washington power brokers to build their fiefdoms of influence, including providing bailouts to Wall Street while businesses on Main Street are being boarded up every day?"" 
We wondered whether Perry was right that members of Congress would still earn nearly $40,000 more than the average American family if their pay were halved. 
First, a little background: Perry's letter to Pelosi followed reports that the second-ranking Democrat in the House, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, had criticized Perry's overhaul proposals. According to a Nov. 15, 2011, Washington Post blog post, Hoyer said: ""Is this a serious proposal that (Perry's) making for a country that has very high unemployment, whose budget deficit is larger than it's ever been in history, and we have two wars that we're confronting and trying to bring to conclusion? If this is what he thinks is pandering to the tea party, it is not, in my opinion, speaking to the issues that the American public feels are very, very critical to them — jobs being the number-one issue."" 
Perry opened his letter by saying that Hoyer's ""outburst"" had caused him to wonder whether Pelosi and the rest of the Democratic caucus also opposed ""urgent reforms the American people so vehemently demand."" Perry closed the letter by inviting Pelosi to debate his proposal with him in Washington — an offer she declined. 
So, what about Perry's numbers? 
His campaign did not respond to a request for information to back up his statement. However, the portion of Perry's campaign website devoted to his ""overhaul Washington"" plan says that the annual salary of members of Congress is $174,000 and that the median household income in the United States is $49,445. 
With those numbers in hand, we can test Perry's statement that if members of Congress lost half their annual pay, they would still earn $38,000 a year more than the average American family. 
Half of $174,000 (congressional pay) is $87,000, which is $37,555 more than the household income figure Perry cites. Round up to get to $38,000. 
Like good fact-checkers, we looked for the source of Perry's figures, starting with the congressional pay number. According to a September 2011 Congressional Research Service report, Perry's figure is on the money: The salary for members of Congress in 2011 and 2012 is $174,000. 
Under a 1989 law, senators and representatives get automatic pay raises each year unless they vote to stop them. The current salary has been in place since Jan. 1, 2009, when members received a 2.8 percent raise. Congress voted to forgo both the 2010 and 2011 increases. A third piece of legislation, passed in 2010, requires that most federal workers and members of Congress not receive a pay increase before Dec. 31, 2012. 
It's important to note that the annual salary figure that Perry used in his calculation excludes the value of benefits that U.S. representatives and senators receive, such as health insurance. It also overlooks other sources of wealth — which can be substantial. 
Members of Congress are required to disclose some information about their finances, and each year, Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, examines those filings and ranks the 50 richest members of Congress. Representatives and senators are not required to report precisely how much they are worth, but they do have to indicate a range of amounts for their assets and liabilities. Focusing on the low end of those ranges, Roll Call calculates each member's minimum net worth, which is then used as the basis for the ranking. 
The paper's latest analysis, published Nov. 1, 2011, says that members had a collective net worth of more than $2 billion in 2010 and that U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, was the richest man in Congress, with a minimum net worth of $294 million. Roll Call reported that ""the lion's share"" of McCaul's wealth is held by his wife, Linda, the daughter of Lowry Mays, who founded media giant Clear Channel Communications. 
Now, to Perry's household income figure. According to Perry's website, that statistic is from a September 2011 Census Bureau report on income, poverty and health insurance coverage in the United States in 2010. Robert Bernstein, a bureau spokesman, told us that the report contains the most recent and best information on U.S. household income, which is based on a survey of 100,000 U.S. addresses. 
Inside, we found that the Census Bureau's estimate for median household income in 2010 was $49,445, as Perry's website says. Reading further into the report, however, we found a couple of wrinkles. 
For starters: Perry's statement describes the median household income statistic as the annual income of ""the average American family."" We think this could be slightly misleading because the popular understanding of ""average"" is different from ""median."" 
According to Webster's New World College Dictionary, the ""average"" is the numerical result you get from adding up a group of numbers and then dividing by the number of figures in the group — a concept known in statistical circles as ""the mean."" The median, meanwhile, is the figure that is exactly in the middle when a group of figures is ranked from smallest to largest. According to the Census Bureau's report, the ""mean"" income for U.S. households in 2010 was quite a bit larger than the median ($67,530 vs. $49,445). 
Should Perry have used the ""mean"" rather than the ""median"" income statistic when talking about the typical American family's income? No, according to experts we asked. 
Although the Census Bureau included both estimates in the charts at the end of its income report, it focused exclusively on the median figure in the body of the report. That's because median income provides ""a truer picture"" of what's typical in the United States, unlike the mean, which can be distorted by a small number of very high earners, Bernstein told us. 
For example, Roll Call in its Nov. 1 article about the wealthiest members of Congress notes that ""as with the general U.S. population, a few exceedingly wealthy people skew the averages for the rest of the membership."" In fact, Roll Call said, McCaul’s minimum net worth is so large that it ""has the effect of raising the average of every member of Congress by about $500,000."" The paper then says that the better number to use for comparisons is the median. 
Pat Wong, a professor at the University of Texas LBJ School of Public Affairs, agreed, telling us that people who study income usually use the median value to try to convey what a ""typical"" family earns because it ""is not affected by extreme values."" 
So, although Perry's use of the word ""average"" in his statement could be misleading, his decision to use the ""median"" — and not the ""mean"" — household income value from the bureau's report seems to be a good one. 
Except that Perry didn't say ""household."" He said ""family."" And we learned from the Census Bureau report that those two are not synonymous. 
According to the bureau's definitions, a ""household"" is all the people who occupy a ""housing unit"" — which can be a house, an apartment or even a single room — regardless of their relationship. That means a ""household"" can be a group of related people — a family — but it can also be a group of unrelated people or a single person. 
The Census Bureau report separates households into two groups: family and nonfamily. ""Family households"" are those that consist of two or more people related by birth, marriage or adoption. The category includes nuclear families, as well as those led by single parents. It does not include any one-person households. 
As one might expect, the median income of ""family households"" is larger than that of the broader category ($61,544 vs. $49,445). 
Had Perry used the family figure in his calculation, his statement in the letter to Pelosi would have had to change a bit: Half of the current congressional salary is still $25,456 (not $38,000) more than what a typical American family makes in a year. 
Perry errs around the fringes, but his big-picture point holds. We rate Perry’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/dec/01/rick-perry/rick-perry-members-congress-half-pay/

Mitt Romney changes position on TARP, DNC says
","
The 2008 act authorizing the Treasury to spend up to $700 billion to stabilize financial markets, also known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, is anathema to many conservative voters. Decried as a golden parachute for the financial industry that did nothing for average Americans, opposition to the law has become almost a basic qualifier for the Republican presidential nomination.

But there’s one candidate who stands by it: Mitt Romney.

Or does he?

A video ad released on Nov. 28, 2011, by the Democratic National Committee accuses Romney of changing his position on a litany of issues -- abortion, climate change, health care reform. Also TARP.

About three minutes into the four-minute ad, the word ""TARP"" appears on screen. Then we see Romney in a split-screen with Fox News interviewer Neil Cavuto.

""TARP got paid back and it kept the financial system from collapsing,"" Romney says.

""So you feel it was well worth it?"" Cavuto asks.

""Well, it was the right thing to do,"" Romney answers.

Cut to another video clip, and we hear Romney say, ""TARP ought to be ended.""

Rewind, then again, ""TARP ought to be ended.""

Sounds contradictory, right? We checked it out.

A fact sheet provided by the DNC tells us the source of the video clips. The first thing to note is that the statement in which Romney appears to support TARP was made after his ""ought to be ended"" clip.

So does that mean Romney was originally against TARP, and then he was for it? Not exactly.

We researched what Romney has said about TARP over the last four years and found that his position has largely remained unchanged.

Here, in chronological order, is a sampling of what Romney has said on the matter.

In March 2009, Romney told Reuters, ""The TARP program, while not transparent and not having been used as wisely it should have been, was nevertheless necessary to keep banks from collapsing in a cascade of failures. You cannot have a free economy and free market if there is not a financial system. … The TARP program was designed to keep the financial system going, to keep money circulating in the economy, without which the entire economy stops and you would really have an economic collapse.""

In December 2009, he said ""TARP ought to be ended"" -- the snippet of the interview used in the DNC ad -- to CNN’s John King. His complete statement, in answer to King’s question about how to get the economy going, was, ""And by the way, TARP has served its purpose. TARP ought to be ended. We've got hundreds of billions of dollars there that is being used as a slush fund by Secretary (Timothy) Geithner and the Obama administration. Stop the TARP recklessness at this point and get ourselves back to creating jobs by encouraging businesses to grow, expand their capital expenditures and hire.""

In January 2010, Romney was interviewed on Fox. He had even more positive things to say about TARP than just what the DNC included in its ad. ""That was an investment made to try and keep a collapse of our entire financial system from occurring,"" Romney told Cavuto.

Also: ""We were on a precipice, which, now we can sit back and say it wasn’t so scary. Well, frankly, it was a very scary time for a lot of people, and that’s something which was resolved.""

Three months later, Romney’s book No Apology came out. He wrote that the TARP program ""was intended to prevent a run on virtually every bank and financial institution in the country. It did in fact keep our economy from total meltdown.""

But he criticized President Barack Obama’s Treasury secretary, Geithner, for using TARP as a ""slush fund."" Under Geithner, the program was ""as poorly explained, poorly understood, poorly structured, and poorly implemented as any legislation in recent memory,"" Romney wrote. His final word on the subject: ""It should be shut down.""

More recently, while campaigning for the presidency, Romney has continued to defend the program as necessary to avoid a worse crisis.

""My experience tells me that we were on the precipice, and we could have had a complete meltdown of our entire financial system, wiping out all the savings of the American people. So action had to be taken,"" he said in a Republican primary debate in October 2011.

Our ruling

The DNC portrayed Romney as having flip-flopped on his support for TARP, using one quote of him saying it was ""the right thing to do"" followed by another that ""it ought to be ended."" But those two sentiments don’t contradict each other (and were presented out of order). Even his remark about ending TARP followed an assertion that the program served its purpose. The statements used in the ad actually echo what Romney has said on the topic all along -- that a Wall Street bailout was necessary to prevent a financial calamity, but the way the money was administered was poor. 
We should note that Romney has spoken more favorably of TARP as originally passed and signed by President George W. Bush. Romney’s later statements about TARP were more critical of its administration by Geithner and Obama, the man Romney aims to defeat in 2012. Nevertheless, while his evaluation of TARP looks at it from two perspectives and is nuanced -- which isn’t necessarily a bad thing -- it’s not a flip flop.

Greg Walden says stimulus hasn't helped Oregon gain jobs
","
Like most Republicans, Rep. Greg Walden says the $825 billion stimulus law has been a failure.

But unlike other critics who speak in contemptuous generalities, Walden puts hard numbers behind his opinion.

""When the bill was signed into law, the White House promised that the stimulus would increase by 44,000 the number of jobs in Oregon by December 2010,"" he says on his official congressional website. ""Unfortunately, even with the stimulus, since the bill was signed, the number of jobs has actually decreased by 18,300 through July 2011.""

Walden supports his claim with a study by the Republican staff of the House Ways and Means Committee. That study relies on federal statistics and, sure enough, both the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Oregon Employment Department show that Oregon had fewer people working in July 2010 than February 2009.

When the stimulus was signed into law in February 2009, 1.643 million people in Oregon held non-farm jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In July 2010, after billions of dollars of stimulus spending had been dispersed, the number of non-farm jobs in Oregon was 1.625 million.

That’s a loss of 18,000 jobs which is the number Walden cited.

But it’s only part of the story.

First, a quick recap. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which is the full name of what is commonly called the stimulus, became law in February 2009.  Democrats pushed the legislation as a way to create jobs and extend unemployment benefits through a mix of government spending, tax cuts and financial aid to cash-strapped states.

The stimulus and its performance have provided a high intensity battlefield ever since. The White House released at least six reports on the program, counting jobs that were created or ""saved"" as a result of the stimulus. Those counts were augmented by dozens of other reports from independent sources.

The most recent came Nov. 22 from the Congressional Budget Office. It says the stimulus is responsible for adding between 500,000 and 3.3 million jobs nationally.

But the CBO, which is nonpartisan, also says its reports, ""do not provide a comprehensive estimate of the law’s impact on U.S. employment, which could be higher or lower...""

Among the reasons is that ""some of the jobs included in the reports might have existed even without the stimulus,"" and that the reports do not ""attempt to measure"" the number of indirect jobs.

Earlier studies, both independent and partisan, have offered similar ranges for the law’s impact on jobs. A March study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers explains why.

""Evaluating the impact,"" said the report, which was the sixth in a series, "" … is inherently difficult because we do not observe what would have happened to the economy in the absence of policy.""

Separately, the council’s report cited four independent analyses by the CBO and three private economic analysis companies that all found between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created.

Oregon’s acting state economist Mark McMullen agrees precision is difficult -- and fraught with politics.

""This issue is about as politically charged as topics in economics get,"" he said.

He points to CBO numbers to explain how many stimulus jobs were created and reported in Oregon. In 2009, 18,412 direct jobs were created with 33,489 in 2010 and 17,663 in 2011.

Even trickier is estimating the indirect jobs from the stimulus. Here, McMullen and other economists extend estimates that Oregon collected between 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent of stimulus jobs depending on the year. That translates to 2,967 to 13,350 indirect jobs in 2009; 8,714 to 41,078 jobs in 2010 and 5,820 to 30,473 jobs in 2011.

Economists say there’s another conundrum: Because of constant churning in the economy, the stimulus law could have generated - or come close to generating - the number of jobs the White House predicted even though total employment in the state declined. The reason is that the jobs total is fluid and that additions in jobs like road construction could be eclipsed by losses in other parts of the economy that aren’t touched by the stimulus.

There are also jobs protected with stimulus money. Teachers, prison guards, and other state workers who probably would have been laid off were able to keep their jobs because the stimulus sent $2.4 billion to Oregon. More than $1.2 billion was used to fill state cuts to education that could have triggered teacher layoffs in every district. Another $117 million went to public safety, with some of that money used to avoid cut-backs in police and emergency response personnel.

The White House and supporters factor those ""saved"" jobs into their calculations. Walden and critics do not.

Got it?

It’s all very murky and far from precise. But this much is certain: As of July 31, 2011, there were 18,300 fewer people working in Oregon than in February 2009. That is the number Walden cites in his comment and that much is true.

But Walden’s context suggests that the stimulus did not produce jobs for Oregon, and that is not correct. While economists and other experts say it’s impossible to say how many Oregon jobs were ""created or saved,"" as the White House puts it, there certainly were some. And it’s clear that a significant number of Oregon jobs would have been lost without the stimulus.

Walden’s assertion of lost jobs uses numbers out of context and leaves out important details. For that reason we rate this claim: Half True.

Republican National Committee Web video attacks Barack Obama's economic record in Pennsylvania
","
As President Barack Obama headed to Scranton, Pa., to push for an extension of a payroll tax break on Nov. 30, 2011, the Republican National Committee released a 30-second Web video criticizing him for the economy’s performance on his watch.

The ad aired audio clips of a candidate Obama visit to Scranton on March 31, 2008, when he was engaged in a tight primary battle with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. As the ad shows images of shuttered factories, Obama talks about the nation’s economic difficulties. Several phrases appear on the screen:

""In 2008 … he promised Pennsylvanians hope & change … Today: Unemployment up 19% … 37,900 Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs lost … 189,000 more Pennsylvanians in poverty … Failed promises. Change direction.""

We’ll take the easy ones first, then take up the complicated one.

Unemployment in Pennsylvania is up 19 percent.

Making comparisons like these can be a bit confusing, because it’s easy to mix up percentage points and percents. But the number is accurate.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate in January 2009 was 6.8 percent, while its rate in October 2011 was 8.1 percent. That’s an increase of 1.3 percentage points, but that can also be expressed as an increase of 19 percent above the initial level.

We should point out that Pennsylvania unemployment is actually down by seven-tenths of a point from its peak of 8.8 percent between January 2010 to April 2010. Expressed the way the ad did it, that means unemployment has fallen by 8 percent since its peak.

But we have no quibble with the RNC’s methodology.

There are 189,000 more Pennsylvanians in poverty.

According to the Census Bureau, the number of Pennsylvanians in poverty rose from 1,335,000 in 2008 (the final year before Obama took office) to 1,521,000 in 2010 (the last year for which data is available). That’s a difference of 186,000 -- close enough in our book to the 189,000 cited in the ad.

37,900 Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs were lost.

According to state employment statistics compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number is correct. Between January 2009, when Obama took office, and October 2011, the most recent month for which state figures are available, Pennsylvania did indeed lose 37,900 manufacturing jobs.

But that isn’t the end of the story.

For starters, it’s PolitiFact’s policy not to focus solely on the accuracy of the numbers in political attacks (or, conversely, efforts to claim political credit) but also to determine whether blame or credit for the results is justified. (This policy applies to all three statistics in this ad.)

For job-creation and job-loss claims, we have ruled that politicians’ policies are just one factor in employment levels, making even statistically accurate claims something less than True on our Truth-O-Meter.

However, the suggestion that manufacturing jobs have declined due to Obama’s policies is even more questionable than most job-related claims we’ve reviewed. As we have noted earlier, the nation’s manufacturing activity has fallen off a cliff over the past 50 years. This stems from countless reasons, ranging from the expansion of free trade to educational attainment patterns to the emergence of new sectors such as information technology.

In January 1960, manufacturing jobs accounted for 29 percent of U.S. employment. By March 2011, that had fallen by about two-thirds, to just 9 percent. And in Pennsylvania, the number of manufacturing jobs has fallen by 40 percent since January 1990, the oldest data available for the state on the BLS Website.

Based on this context, we think it’s a stretch to blame Obama for the decline in manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania since January 2009. But the claim is even more problematic if you look at how manufacturing in Pennsylvania fared under Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush.

Between the time Bush took office in January 2001 and the time he left in January 2009, the number of Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs fell by 244,900. Dividing by Bush’s eight years in the White House, that works out to an annual decline of 30,613 manufacturing jobs.

Yet taking the decline under Obama and dividing that by 2.83 years in office works out to 13,376 manufacturing jobs lost per year -- or less than half the rate of decline under Bush.

In other words, during the worst economic conditions since the Great Depression, Pennsylvania manufacturing job losses declined less than half as quickly under Obama as under Bush. This clashes with the overall message of the ad, which is that Obama economic policies have failed Pennsylvania, and -- judging by the ad’s imagery -- its manufacturing sector in particular.

This may not offer much solace for the Obama camp -- it’s hard to crow, ""The Pennsylvania manufacturing sector eroded more slowly on our watch than it did under our predecessor!"" -- but we do think it’s important context to point out.

Our rating

The ad gets all of its numbers right, but it overreaches by holding Obama fully accountable for these trends. In particular, the RNC’s manufacturing jobs statistic ignores both a decades-long national and state decline in manufacturing jobs and the fact that the rate of manufacturing job losses in Pennsylvania during Obama’s presidency was slower than the rate of job losses under his predecessor, George W. Bush. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/nov/30/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-web-video-attacks-ba/

Mitt Romney's views on climate change have changed, says DNC
","Global warming has become a hot potato, at least for Republican presidential candidates.

We’ve seen candidates for the Republican nomination question whether there’s scientific consensus on climate change, but those statements are at odds with the facts. We’ve found the scientific consensus is still firmly on the side of a warming planet. We looked at Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s statement that scientists are ""questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change. … (It is) more and more being put into question."" We rated that False.

The Democratic National Committee recently attacked Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, for flip-flopping on whether he believes climate change was real. (It also accused him of flip-flopping on a number of other issues; see all of our fact-checks of their claims here.)

In a four-minute web ad, the DNC spliced together video of Romney first saying, ""Well, I believe the world is getting warmer … I believe that humans contribute to that.""

And then saying, ""My view is that we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet.""

We decided to check into whether Romney has changed his views or not.

Romney’s comments, take 1

Romney’s first comments were from a town hall in New Hampshire in June 2011. A voter asked if he thought climate change existed and was caused by human activity, noting that scientific evidence showed that to be the case.

Here’s part of Romney’s answer (watch the exchange on C-SPAN starting at the 21:00 mark):

""I don't speak for the scientific community, of course. But I believe the world is getting warmer. I can't prove that, but I believe based on what I read that the world is getting warmer. And number two, I believe that humans contribute to that. I don’t know how much our contribution is to that, because I know there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past, but I believe that we contribute to that. So I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing.""

Romney then suggested that the U.S. should reduce its dependence on foreign oil and use more domestically produced natural gas and nuclear energy. And he said some carbon-emitting forms of energy would still have to be used.

Romney also said he opposed the United States unilaterally adopting a cap-and-trade plan if other countries weren’t taking similar steps to reduce greenhouse emissions. For background, a cap-and-trade plan would require industry to pay for their carbon emissions with new permit fees. There would be a limited amount of permits (the ""cap""), but companies would be able to buy and sell the permits among themselves (the ""trade"").

Romney also mentioned that he wrote about energy policy in his book, No Apology. In that book, he wrote, ""I believe that climate change is occurring. The reduction in the size of global ice caps is hard to ignore. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor.""

He also wrote that cap-and-trade was ""an energy tax, disguised in the sheep’s clothing of market terminology. And it is an energy tax that would have little or no effect on global warming.""

Romney’s comments, take 2

Romney’s second set of comments came at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pa., a few months later. His comments were videotaped and posted to a blog called New Hampshire 2012: Green and promoted by Think Progress.

In this case, a voter asked Romney, ""What is your position on man-made global warming and would you reject legislation, such as cap and trade, which is based on the idea of man-made global warming?""

Romney first said he was opposed to cap-and-trade, then said this:

""My view is that we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us. My view with regards to energy policy is pretty straightforward. I want us to become energy secure and independent of the oil cartels. And that means let’s aggressively develop our oil, our gas, our coal, our nuclear power.""

Much of Romney’s underlying policy-- reduce foreign oil dependence; increase the use of natural gas and nuclear power; oppose cap-and-trade  -- remained the same in both contexts. In a few cases, he even uses the same phrasing to describe the policies.

But his comments about the cause of global warming did change markedly.

After Romney’s remarks were widely reported, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul told the Boston Globe that Romney was not flip-flopping: ""This is ridiculous,"" she said in a statement. ""Governor Romney’s view on climate change has not changed. He believes it’s occurring, and that human activity contributes to it, but he doesn’t know to what extent. He opposes cap and trade, and he refused to sign such a plan when he was governor.""

We will be watching to see if Romney is asked again about his thoughts on global warming; we were unable to find any other remarks since then about whether he thought human beings contribute to global warming or not.

Our ruling

In June 2011, Romney said he believed ""the world is getting warmer"" and that ""humans contribute to that."" In October 2011, Romney said that ""we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet.""

Interestingly, in spite of his comments on the causes of climate change, Romney outlined the same set of energy policies: in favor of more natural gas and nuclear power; against foreign oil; for the continued use of domestic oil; against a cap-and-trade plan.

Because he didn’t articulate any change of policy, we find Romney’s comments on the causes of climate change perplexing, and we would be interested in hearing him answer pointed questions on the matter. His spokeswoman says the two statements are consistent. But the videos clearly shows that he said different things on the causes of climate change to different audiences, and we believe Romney is savvy enough to know the difference between suggesting a human role in climate change and leaving it out. We rate the DNC’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/nov/30/democratic-national-committee/mitt-romneys-views-climate-change-have-changed-say/

Fox's Sean Hannity says Bill Nelson voted with Dems ""nearly 95 percent"" of the time
","
Republican U.S. Rep. Connie Mack announced his U.S. Senate bid in a Nov. 28, 2011, interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News.
     
Mack -- with some help from Hannity -- tried to sell the message that the incumbent, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, moves in lockstep with President Barack Obama.
   
""I am going to run for the United States Senate because frankly, I think the people of Florida have had enough,"" Mack said. ""They've had enough of every time they turn around, Sen. Nelson is supporting and helping Barack Obama with Barack Obama's agenda of more government whether it's helping him with Obamacare. You know, Sen. Nelson was there right by Obama's side. Whether it was the stimulus, again, Sen. Nelson was right by Obama's side to make sure that was passed. Whether it was trillions of dollars in more spending, more tax increases, you name it on down the line. Sen. Nelson has been one of Barack Obama's go-to guys in the Senate.""
     
This web ad, paid for by Friends of Connie Mack at lockstepliberals.com, shows Obama and Nelson embracing. And Hannity suggested that Nelson, first elected in 2000, is also in lockstep with his party:
   
""Well, the other thing is he's voted with the Democrats in Congress nearly 95 percent of the time. I was looking up his record,"" Hannity said. ""He praised Obama during the last election. Now he doesn't want to be seen with Obama, which is pretty interesting. And I think the thing that has resonated nationally ...""
   
Here, we decided to check Hannity, since he offered the most precise measure of Nelson's partisan leanings -- that he ""voted with the Democrats in Congress nearly 95 percent of the time."" We couldn't reach Hannity and during the interview he didn't specify any timeline for Nelson's votes, so we focused on the most recent vote analyses from a few different organizations that compare Nelson's voting record with the rest of the Senate.   
   
OpenCongress. Created by the Participatory Politics Foundation and the Sunlight Foundation, OpenCongress measures how often senators vote with their party, factoring in every single vote since the beginning of the current 112th session of Congress. According to OpenCongress, Nelson voted with his party on 190 out of 209 votes, a percentage of 90.9 percent.
       
While seemingly high, that voting record actually put him near the bottom of Democrats in the U.S. Senate -- ranking 39th out of 51. Why? Because the percentage itself is a poor indicator of partisanship, OpenCongress itself says. ""Since the vast majority of the hundreds of votes factored in are routine in nature, the result is that even highly independent senators have a seemingly high score on voting with their party,"" the website says in a disclaimer. Relatively, then, Nelson ranks among more moderate Democrats.
            
U.S. Congress Votes Washington Post database. The Washington Post analysis measured 208 votes in the 112th Congress, finding that Nelson voted with his party 94 percent of the time. The database shows about 39 senators, Republicans and Democrats, voted with their party more often than Nelson (there are a lot of ties included).

 National Journal ranking. The National Journal measures votes differently, only examining votes taken on key economic, social and foreign policy issues. The publication then assigns members a composite score and commensurate ranking. In 2010, Nelson ranked as the 42nd most liberal and 53rd most conservative senator, according to the Journal. The Journal placed Nelson in the ""centrists"" category.
       
CQ Vote Studies. Congressional Quarterly's analysis assigns members a score based on ""party unity"" -- or the frequency that someone votes with their party on occasions when a majority of Republicans oppose a majority of Democrats. If both parties supported a piece of legislation it wasn't included in the analysis -- in 2010, CQ analyzed 299 votes in the Senate. Nelson received an 89 percent in 2010. (To view historical data requires a subscription but CQ emailed us a chart showing Nelson's scores for a decade which ranged from 76 to 93 percent in the past decade. CQ told us that Nelson's score is 90 percent so far in 2011 as of 3 p.m. Nov. 29, 2011.)
   
Our ruling
   
Hannity said that Nelson ""voted with the Democrats in Congress nearly 95 percent of the time."" The Washington Post database shows Nelson voted with his party 94 percent of the time for the current session -- and OpenCongress shows a slightly lower figure at 90.9 percent with CQ not far behind at 89 percent.
   
But simply reporting the figure doesn't provide context. 
Even highly independent senators have a seemingly high score when it comes to voting with their party, in large part because most votes are routine in nature. A more useful measure might be comparing the relative position of one senator to another, or comparing the position of all senators en masse. 
That comparison shows that Nelson is much more of a moderate than Hannity's figure suggests.   
Nelson is the 42nd most liberal senator out of 100, according to the National Journal, while OpenCongress says there are 38 more reliable Democratic votes. That's why we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/nov/30/sean-hannity/foxs-sean-hannity-says-sen-nelson-voted-dems-nearl/

Mike DeWine cites link between viewing child pornography and molestation cases
","
There is no category of crimes more revolting to most people than sexual crimes committed against children.

In the wake of the Penn State scandal, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine rolled out a new ""Crimes Against Children"" initiative on Nov. 18 targeting Internet predators who trade child pornography or actually molest or attempt to molest children.

Flanked by police chiefs and prosecutors, DeWine announced that he was dedicating a new 15-person unit to focus on stopping crimes against children. The unit would be part of the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation, which is run by his office. Attempting to demonstrate the prevalence of the crimes in today’s society, DeWine focused on the link between viewers of child pornography and the actual molestation of children.

""At a minimum, 40 percent of those who view child pornography end up molesting children as a result,"" DeWine said. ""At least 40 percent, some estimates as high as 80 percent.""

PolitiFact Ohio was struck by the relatively high percentage cited by DeWine and the cause and effect he said exists between viewing child porn and committing physical acts of sexual contact against children. Could four in 10 people who viewed child porn really be committing sexual acts against children?

We turned first to DeWine’s office for some supporting evidence, who quickly e-mailed us a pair of studies said to back up his claim.  

The first study, entitled ""A Profile of Pedophilia: Definition, Characteristics of Offenders, Recidivism, Treatment Outcomes, and Forensic Issues, is from doctors at the Mayo Clinic.

It states that 30 to 80 percent of arrested individuals who viewed child pornography and 76 percent of individuals who were arrested for Internet child pornography had molested a child, according to studies and case reports. The study quotes from a November 2004 article from the American Prosecutors Research Institute called ""From Fantasy to Reality: The Link Between Viewing Child Pornography and Molesting Children"" written by Candice Kim. It also apparently references a 2000 study of sex offender inmates in a Federal Bureau of Prisons program.  

Kim’s report cites a U.S. Postal Inspection Service finding that 80 percent of purchasers of child pornography are active abusers and nearly 40 percent of the child pornographers investigated over several years have sexually molested children. A footnote indicates the statement is taken from the 2002 testimony Ernie Allen, director of The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, when he appeared before a  congressional committee.

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service made 1,807 child porn arrests from January 1997 to March 2004 which netted 620 ""confirmed child molesters,"" the article states. That is a child molestor rate of 34.3 percent, according to the statistic provided by U.S. Postal Inspection Service Agent Ray Smith during a 2004 interview with Kim.

Other statistics found in the report include a Pennsylvania-based law enforcement task force reporting that 51 percent of individuals arrested for pornography-related offense were also determined to be actively molesting children or to have molested in the past. In Dallas, a similar task force put that figure at 31 percent. The original source of those statements was again Allen’s 2002 congressional testimony.   

The other study cited by DeWine’s office is a 2005 study funded by a congressional grant to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. In that study of 1,713 people arrested nationwide for child pornography in a one-year period from July 2000 to July 2001, 40 percent were ""dual offenders"" who sexually victimized children and possessed child pornography with both crimes discovered in the same investigation.

So what are all these studies saying?

They are saying there is a link between those arrested by various state and federal law enforcement agencies for child porn possession and acts of molestation of children by this same group of people.  

What the do not say, though, is that the link exists for the entire group of people that views child porn and whether those people molest children.

As the 2005 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children report puts it ""we do not know if these child porn possessors were representative of all Internet-related child porn possessors.""   

Furthermore, that report states that there is no known evidence supporting cause and effect -- that simply possessing child pornography encourages or causes child victimization. There has been no study of this issue.  

""Knowing a considerable number of dual offenders were discovered during investigations of Internet-related, child-sexual victimization and child porn possession cases does not explain how possessing child pornography is related to child victimization or whether it encourages or causes such victimization,"" states the report. ""We do not have data to determine this.""

Later, the report states as to whether the child porn viewing is done before the molesting ""we had no information about the sequencing of crimes committed by dual offenders.""  

Meanwhile, a 2000 study done by psychologists working with prisoners in the Federal Bureau of Prisons sex offender treatment program found that 76 percent of inmates charged with child pornography crimes admitted to having committed contact sex crimes. That study was followed up in 2009 by a similar study which found that 85 percent of 155 convicted sex offenders had committed at least one ""hands on sexual offense.""

However, a paper prepared by one of the primary authors of both studies, Andres Hernandez, stresses not to apply the statistics of those convicted of child porn possession to the larger ""unknown"" population of child porn users.

""The number of individuals who are apprehended by law enforcement for committing child porn offenses represents a small proportion of the population of individuals collecting, trading and producing child pornography worldwide,"" Hernandez writes. ""Some individuals have misused the results (of the two studies) to fuel the argument that the majority of child porn offenders are indeed contact sexual offenders and, therefore, dangerous predators. This is simply not supported by the scientific evidence.""

Said Hernandez’s paper: ""Some individuals in law enforcement are tempted to rely on a biased interpretation of our study...to prove that the majority of child porn offenders are child molestors.""

Hernandez’s paper also notes something not reported in this 2009 study — that a 42-person sample of the prisoners were asked questions about when they began possessing child porn compared to when they began committing contact sexual crimes.

""The vast majority of our subjects indicated they committed hands-on abuse prior to seeking child pornography via the Internet,"" he writes. ""The results indicated that in 41 of 42 cases examined hands-on sexual crimes preceded child porn offenses.""  

So where are we left as we bid this abhorrent subject goodbye?

At a news conference promoting a crackdown on sexual crimes against children, DeWine made statements stating that ""at a minimum 40 percent of those who view child pornography end up molesting children as a result.""

Molestation crimes are horrific. And while DeWine’s statement is overly broad, it does contain an element of truth: that people who commit acts of child molestation also often view child pornography.

His statements are based on studies which are all of those arrested for child porn offenses and range from a 31 percent child molester rate up to 85 percent, depending on the study.  

However, several of the authors of those studies caution that the numbers should not be generalized to the bigger universe of all people who have viewed child porn -- those who have been arrested and those who have not. And that’s exactly what DeWine did.

And researchers caution that there is no evidence that the molesting of children by those possessing child porn takes place as a result of viewing the child porn, a claim made by DeWine. Quite to the contrary, study of this cause-effect relationship we found suggests that nearly all offenders committed acts of molestation prior to looking at child porn.

Those are critical facts that would give a different impression of DeWine’s claim.

On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/nov/30/mike-dewine/mike-dewine-cites-link-between-viewing-child-porno/

Talk-show host John DePetro says for eight years, Governor Carcieri hosted lighting of 'Christmas tree'
","Thanksgiving is over and you know what that means -- shopping, bright lights, parties and the traditional gnashing of teeth by people who obsess over what to call those evergreens bedecked with lights and baubles.

You could hear the molars grinding Nov. 29 when WPRO talk-show host John DePetro complained indignantly that Governor Lincoln Chafee, an independent, had invited everyone to the lighting of the ""holiday tree"" at the State House.

While talking to guest state Rep. Joseph Trillo, a Republican who co-sponsored a House resolution in January urging that such trees always be referred to as Christmas trees, DePetro said the terminology used by Chafee (whom DePetro calls ""Governor Grinch"") was a break from tradition.

""For the past eight years, Gov. Carcieri and Mrs. Carcieri would host the lighting of the State House Christmas tree,"" he said, referring to Chafee's predecessor, Republican Donald Carcieri.

Chafee's office issued a response asserting that ""use of the term 'holiday tree' is a continuation of past practice.""

So who is correct?

Credit Ted Nesi of WPRI.com for digging into this one.

Nesi found the Carcieris' 2009 invitation to ""The Annual Holiday Tree Lighting,"" which includes a list of ""Holiday festivities."" The word ""Christmas"" doesn't appear.

One of Nesi’s Twitter followers forwarded an archived 2006 news release from Carcieri that talks about ""the annual tree-lighting ceremony."" The word ""Christmas"" never appears.

We found another news release, this one from 2003, in which there's no reference to Christmas in the announcement of the ""annual tree-lighting ceremony.""

When we contacted DePetro Tuesday evening, he said he did a Google search and found that in 2010 it was referred to as a Christmas tree. ""I just went on last year,"" he said. ""I think I said the eight years, but I didn't have that as a fact.""

Our ruling

Talk-radio host John DePetro stated, ""For the past eight years Gov. Carcieri and Mrs. Carcieri would host the lighting of the State House Christmas tree"" -- emphasizing the words ""Christmas tree"" --  to criticize Chafee's reference to ""holiday tree.""

Certainly the Carcieri administration wasn't reluctant to use the term ""Christmas tree."" But we found more than a few exceptions that used the term ""holiday tree"" -- just as Chafee has -- and the word ""Christmas"" was noticeably absent.

We rule DePetro's statement False.

"['Georgia', 'Jobs', 'Eric Gray']","

Is Georgia job loss claim on the money?
","
Georgia Democrats are apparently following the Republican Party playbook on the economic blame game.

Over the past year, GOP leaders have blamed President Barack Obama, a Democrat, for the nation’s high unemployment rate and other fiscal troubles.

In Georgia, Democrats are criticizing Republican Gov. Nathan Deal, who took office in January, for some of this state’s economic problems.

Eric Gray, the communications director of the Georgia Democratic Party, attempted to make the case at a news conference in Augusta. Deal made promises to create jobs and hasn’t delivered, Gray said.

""I challenge him to show us where those jobs are,"" Gray was quoted as saying in the Augusta Chronicle.

Here’s the part that piqued our interest. The newspaper paraphrased Gray as saying Georgia is one of only seven states to lose jobs this year. The grand total of jobs lost? About 8,200, Gray said.

Most economists define job creation as a net increase in the number of people employed between one time frame and another and job losses as a net decrease between two periods of time.

In January, about 3,806,600 Georgians were employed, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is the main source economists and others use to track employment data. In September, the most recent month available when Gray made his comments, the number of Georgians employed dropped to an estimated 3,798,400.

The difference: 8,200 jobs.

The September estimate has been readjusted by the BLS to an estimated 3,797,500, which is a 9,100 job difference.

Through September, there were about 3,200 fewer people employed in manufacturing than there were at the beginning of the year and about 5,000 fewer Georgians in the financial activities industry. The biggest change was in government, where there were nearly 18,000 fewer Georgians employed.

Gray told us via email that ""government losses are indeed still job losses.""

There’s been a slight increase so far this year in the number of Georgians employed in construction, education and health services and in the category of leisure and hospitality, according to the federal data.

In October, the most recent month available, there were about 3,800,100 Georgians employed, a slight uptick from September. The October estimate is still less than the total in January.

Now, how many other states have lost jobs since the beginning of the year?

Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Maine, Vermont and Virginia lost jobs, according to the BLS. Including Georgia, that adds up to seven states.

In Georgia, the initial job loss estimate of 8,200 was a reduction of 0.2 percent. The job loss difference was greatest in Delaware, 0.6 percent.

It may seem premature to say Deal has not done enough to create more jobs in nine months. The claims that Gray made were correct on both points. But there is this caveat:  Many of the job losses were in government and not the private sector.

DNC ad says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on taxpayer pledge
","
On Nov. 28, 2011, the Democratic National Committee released two videos designed to paint Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as a serial flip-flopper. The shorter, 30-second version gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with a four-minute version that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues. 
For this item, we’ll check one of the claims from the four-minute version -- specifically, whether Romney has changed his position on signing a taxpayer protection pledge. We're looking at other aspects of the ad in separate items. 
Here’s the relevant portion from the DNC ad: 
Screen text: Will not sign pledge 
Audio of Candy Crowley: ""Republican Mitt Romney says he will not sign a no-new-taxes pledge."" 
Screen text: Then he did 
Audio from Romney radio ad: ""I’m proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge."" 
The first clip refers to an announcement during Romney’s 2002 gubernatorial campaign that he would not sign a pledge circulated by Citizens for Limited Taxation, a Massachusetts-based anti-tax group. 
Here’s how the Boston Globe covered the news: 
""In a break with Acting Governor Jane Swift and her GOP predecessors, Republican gubernatorial candidate Mitt Romney is refusing to rule out tax increases and said yesterday he will not sign a ‘no new taxes’ pledge,"" the newspaper wrote. ""Romney said that while he opposes all tax increases in principle, he will not make such a pledge in writing."" 
The article went on to quote Romney saying, ""I am not in favor of increasing taxes. … At this stage, I am inclined to make that position as clear as I can but not to enter into a written pledge of some kind, and that's true on this and other issues."" 
The Globe cited another comment by Romney that had been reported by the Union-News of Springfield, Mass. ""I'm against tax increases,"" Romney told attendees of Western Massachusetts GOP meeting, according to the Union-News. ""But I'm not intending to, at this stage, sign a document which would prevent me from being able to look specifically at the revenue needs of the Commonwealth."" 
Barbara Anderson, an official with Citizens for Limited Taxation, was unhappy with Romney's refusal to sign, which came after he’d met with her for half an hour. ""He's thinking like an independent businessman who doesn't sign pledges,"" she suggested to the Globe. 
Meanwhile, the Boston Herald quoted then Romney deputy campaign manager Eric Fehrnstrom saying, ""Mitt Romney doesn't have to sign a piece of paper to have a position on an issue. He's pledged to oppose any tax increase, he doesn't support them, his position on taxes is clear."" 
In an interview with the Globe, Fehrnstrom was even more dismissive, calling the pledge ""government by gimmickry,"" the newspaper reported. 
Put it all together and you have a candidate who didn’t just decide against signing a pledge but who cast doubt on the propriety of such pledges in general. 
Now we’ll fast-forward a few years, when Romney, having finished a term as governor of Massachusetts, was running for president. On Dec. 31, 2006, Romney became the first major candidate for the 2008 election to sign a taxpayer protection pledge offered by Americans for Tax Reform, the anti-tax group headed by Grover Norquist. 
""In signing the pledge, Gov. Romney firmly commits himself in writing to fiscal discipline and economic common sense,"" Norquist said in a news release. ""Mitt Romney has told taxpayers in no uncertain terms that he plans to look out for their interests."" 
Romney hardly signed the Norquist pledge covertly. On Jan. 4, 2007, he issued a press release touting his action, and on Oct. 5, 2007, he released a radio ad spotlighting it. That’s where the DNC got the clip used in its ad. 
""For years, conservative candidates for president signed their name on the dotted line pledging to oppose tax increases,"" Romney said in the ad. ""I'm Mitt Romney. I'm proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge. The others have not. I signed the tax pledge because I want everyone to know where I stand. We've got to get taxes down and grow our economy. I believe it's not fair that you have to pay taxes when you earn your money, when you save your money and when you die. That's why I'll kill the death tax once and for all and roll back tax rates across the board. And savings? When I'm president, for every middle class American, the new tax rate on your interest, dividends, and capital gains will be absolutely zero. I stood firm to roll back taxes as governor. I'll roll back taxes as president."" 
In this case, then, Romney not only signed a written pledge but actively broadcast it to the electorate. 
It’s worth noting that the two pledges are not exactly the same. One addressed the state context and one the federal context. 
The Massachusetts text is a ""pledge to ... all the people of this state, that I will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes."" 
The Norquist pledge, to which Romney is still a signatory, requires the signer to ""oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses … and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates."" 
Still, despite the differences in wording, we think the pledges are equivalent in their underlying requirements. 
Our ruling 
In 2002, Romney refused to make ""a pledge in writing"" on taxes. Four years later, he signed one and touted it as a selling point for his candidacy. In our book, that’s a clear flip-flop. We rate the DNC’s charge True.",/factchecks/2011/nov/29/democratic-national-committee/dnc-ad-says-mitt-romney-flip-flopped-taxpayer-pled/

Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump said 'I alone can fix it'
","Hillary Clinton said during her Democratic convention speech that voters shouldn’t trust Donald Trump because of his go-it-alone mentality. ""And most of all, don't believe anyone who says: ‘I alone can fix it.,’"" Clinton said on the last night of the convention in Philadelphia. ""Those were actually Donald Trump's words in Cleveland."" Clinton then reeled off a list of folks she said Trump was forgetting, including soldiers, police officers, firefighters, doctors and nurses, teachers, entrepreneurs and mothers who lost children to violence. ""He's forgetting every last one of us,"" she said. ""Americans don't say: ""I alone can fix it."" We wondered if that’s what Trump really said. We did not hear back from the Trump campaign. Trump’s RNC speech We found the comment in Trump’s speech at the Republican convention right after he rattled off a list of criticisms of Clinton, including one about her practice keeping State Department emails on her private server. He then pivoted to explain why he should be president: ""I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves. I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it.

""But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and wealth. Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly, and justly, for each and every American."" So Clinton did accurately quote Trump -- he did say ""I alone can fix it."" But he did say more than that. Clinton mentioned several types of Americans who work to ""fix it together"" such as police officers, implying that Trump ignored the crucial role they play in fixing our country’s problems. But Trump did mention that he would work with law enforcement: ""I will work with, and appoint, the best and brightest prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job done."" On foreign policy, Trump talked about working with allies: ""We must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terror. This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel."" Our ruling Clinton said Trump said at the Republican convention ""I alone can fix it."" Trump did say those words when explaining why he thinks he is the best candidate for president. However, Clinton omitted that in other portions of his speech he showed a willingness to work with partners including prosecutors, law enforcement and foreign allies.

Did Trump bail on building condos in Florida?
","Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine questioned Donald Trump’s business ethics, saying the Republican presidential candidate swindled customers in a past real estate deal in the Sunshine State. ""Retirees and families in Florida — they believed Donald Trump when he said he'd build them some condos. Thousands of them,"" Kaine said on the third night of the Democratic National Convention. ""They paid their deposits, but the condos, they were never built. He just pocketed their money and walked away. They lost tens of thousands of dollars, all because they believed Donald Trump."" A Kaine spokesman told us the senator was referring to not one, but two failed condo projects: One in Tampa and one in Fort Lauderdale. Trump’s campaign did not respond. We wanted to know if people lost tens of thousands of dollars in deposits while Trump took the money without consequence. Since there are two projects, we’ll take them one at a time. Trump Tower Tampa In 2004, at the height of the Tampa real estate boom, local developers incorporated under the name SimDag/Robel contacted Trump to ask him to partner on a condo tower they wanted to build. The group eventually reached a licensing agreement with Trump: He would lend his name to Trump Tower Tampa for $2 million plus a percentage of condo sales. The document stipulated that neither the developers nor Trump would ""under any circumstances disclose or permit to be disclosed the existence of this agreement.'' No one would know Trump’s involvement was in name only. Trump announced the deal on Jan. 10, 2005, saying he would ""partner"" with SimDag/Robel to build a 52-story, 190-unit condo tower in downtown Tampa. (Less than two weeks later, Trump married Slovenian model Melania Knauss in a Palm Beach wedding attended by now-rival Hillary Clinton.) The next month, Trump and his new bride attended a sales launch in Tampa. Trump told reporters at a gala reception with 600 guests that he had a ""substantial stake"" in the project and that units were selling well. Now, it’s here we’ll note that Kaine said in his speech there were ""thousands of them,"" which his spokesman said was referring to thousands of dollars. By the time Trump came to Tampa, customers had placed sizable deposits on all 190 units, which cost between $700,000 and $6 million. The amount of those deposits varied depending on the unit. With 190 units, Kaine’s description of the customers as ""retirees and families"" is a plausible definition. Tampa Bay Times reporter Susan Taylor Martin noted customers included doctors, NFL coaches, a video game developer and more. Under the sales agreement, half of the deposit cash went into an escrow account, while the other half went to construction costs. But the project ran over budget quickly. The site required a redesign of the foundation, and construction issues soon ballooned the cost of the project from initially being $227 million to $300 million. In 2006, the developers held a groundbreaking, but had yet to secure financing. Trump’s licensing agreement was modified that year, giving him $4 million but conceding a cut of the sales. SimDag/Robel stopped paying, and Trump sued in May 2007, claiming he was owed $1.03 million in licensing fees. That lawsuit was the first indication for buyers that Trump was only slapping his name on the project. SimDag/Robel countersued Trump for breaking the confidentiality of the licensing agreement by complaining publicly about the project. Trump and the developers settled in 2008. SimDag/Robel called off the entire project and declared bankruptcy. Buyers, meanwhile, were out of luck. While the escrow half of their deposits was returned, the other half had been eaten up by construction costs. Some customers were out as much as $250,000 or more. Several dozen buyers sued Trump in 2009, arguing that they had been misled with ""fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations"" that the billionaire was more involved with the project bearing his name. Within three years, the buyers in the lawsuit reached settlements. Some were repaid as little as $11,115, according to the Times. Other buyers not a part of the suit received nothing. Jay McLaughlin, a physical therapist from Connecticut, told the Times he lost almost $90,000. An attorney named Mary Ann Stiles told the newspaper she was out $200,000. Other investors who gave SimDag/Robel money said they lost six- and seven-figure sums. Trump International Hotel & Tower Fort Lauderdale A similar scenario played out on Florida’s Atlantic coast, when Trump struck a secretive deal with a group of developers to lend his name to a building. The Trump International Hotel & Tower Fort Lauderdale was slated to be a 24-story, 298-unit condo hotel, in which owners rent out their units like hotel rooms. When the project was unveiled in 2004, units cost between $500,000 and $3 million, with 20 percent deposits required. Buyers were wooed with brochures touting Trump’s involvement, including one in which Trump said the resort was ""the finest and most luxurious experience I have created."" Units sold well through 2006, and these deposits were split the same way as Trump Tower Tampa. Also like Tampa, construction costs soon spiraled out of control. The building was slated to be finished by December 2007 but was nowhere near done. Then one of the developing partners, Bayrock Group, sold its interest to an Icelandic investment firm for $50 million. The following year, Trump began to voice major concerns to development partner Roy Stillman of SB Hotel Associates that work wasn’t being completed, despite some $140 million being spent on construction. The real estate market began its tailspin and the partners had difficulty securing more financing. In 2009, Trump decided to strip his name off the project after Stillman attempted to close with buyers to get more money, even though the building wasn’t yet completed. With $185 million in debt and no billionaire name recognition, Trump International Hotel & Tower Fort Lauderdale was dead. What Trump actually made on this deal is much more obscure, because the entire project ended in more than a dozen lawsuits among Trump, the developers and the buyers. (Lawsuits against Trump also have resulted in other developments in which Trump licensed his name in places like Canada, Hawaii and Mexico.) One depositor, Naraine Seecharan, told the Miami Herald he was recovering from the removal of a brain tumor when he learned about the fate of his $289,000 down payment. J. Michael Goodson of New Jersey said he put down $345,000 and sued Trump. Pembroke Pines attorney Joseph Altschul represented more than 70 clients who said they had paid about $8 million in deposits. In all, more than 100 buyers filed lawsuits. CFLB Partnership bought the unfinished project in 2013 for $115 million, finishing the building and renaming it the Conrad Fort Lauderdale Resort & Residences. Trump and the developers continued to argue. Trump also sued the developers, saying he lost millions in licensing and hotel management fees over the deal. He maintained in the various lawsuits he held no liability, while the partners struggled to reach settlements with buyers. (Trump’s attorneys also got in trouble for hiding a $5 million insurance policy to help cover lawsuits for making misleading statements.) ""Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers,"" Trump said in a 2013 deposition. ""We worked on the documents, we worked on the room sizes and the things, but we didn't give out the contracts, we didn't get the financing, we weren't the developer, but we did work with the developer."" Trump and his affiliated companies have not been found at fault in the Fort Lauderdale lawsuits, thanks to contract language that stated Trump’s involvement was in name only. His legal team maintained the suits against him were more about Trump’s money and anger over the housing crash. The billionaire maintained that buyers were better off losing deposit money than taking more of a bath in a bad real estate investment, as the condos were worth roughly half what people would have paid in full. In one 2014 trip to the witness stand, he said someone would have to be ""very stupid"" to have still attempted to buy a condo in the building after the real estate crash. ""Only a fool would have closed under those circumstances,"" Trump said. In April 2016, a Florida appeals court ruled on the last two active cases seeking deposits. The three-judge-panel upheld prior findings that Trump did not misrepresent his role in the development. Our ruling Kaine said Florida retirees and families ""lost tens of thousands of dollars"" in deposits on failed Trump condo projects, but he ""pocketed their money and walked away."" It’s clear that many buyers, whatever their occupation or familial status, indeed lost at least that much in the failed Trump projects in Tampa and Fort Lauderdale. Some were further compensated partially with settlements after suing the billionaire. Whether Trump cheated them is another matter. While his licensing agreements with the developers were secret, he was entitled to a certain amount of money for putting his name on the building. He was sued by several dozen angry buyers and either settled or was found not at fault, which is not the same as walking away without addressing the problems. Kaine’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b0c3e425-5851-49f6-9bec-ecace6975c3c",/factchecks/2016/jul/29/tim-kaine/did-trump-bail-building-condos-florida/

Fact-checking Bill Clinton on Hillary's big climate change accomplishment
","In detailing their much-scrutinized marriage and love story at the Democratic National Convention, former President Bill Clinton also took care to list his wife’s numerous legislative and foreign policy achievements. Among them: ""She put climate change at the center of our foreign policy. She negotiated the first agreement ever — ever — where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions."" While Bill Clinton’s claim is largely accurate, he’s offering a rosy spin on the Copenhagen Accord of 2009, which was at the time and continues to be widely panned. Hillary Clinton did play a key -- but not solo -- role in the talks with China and India, and it was the first time the two countries made emissions reduction pledges in an international agreement. But unlike the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 or Paris Agreement of 2015, the accord wasn’t actually an official agreement. It wasn’t ""adopted"" by signatories, but merely ""taken note of"" (in other words, they formally recognized the accord’s existence). Furthermore, the ""agreement"" was non-binding and the countries set their own voluntary targets, leading some environmentalists and experts to cast it aside as essentially meaningless. Let’s dive in. Before Copenhagen, China and India had both signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol, which the United States backed out of. But because they were developing countries, they were not required to curb their carbon emissions. In 2007, in response to overtaking the United States as the world’s biggest carbon emitter, China released its first national climate change program and said it would reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by 2010 and ""consequently reduce CO2 emissions."" Similarly, India released a national action plan on climate change in 2008, in which it didn’t commit to reducing emissions but laid out steps that would. But it wasn’t until Copenhagen that the two countries finally committed to reducing carbon emissions. In this sense, the accord ""played a major role in breaking"" the ""firewall"" between developed countries and developing countries when it came to climate action responsibility, according to  David Ciplet, an environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who wrote Power in a Warming World: The New Global Politics of Climate Change and the Remaking of Environmental Inequality. ""However, whether the Copenhagen Accord was a positive development overall is definitely controversial,"" Ciplet told PolitiFact. Nonetheless, like her husband, Hillary Clinton often touts the accord as one of her major climate change accomplishments, referring to it as a ""key diplomatic breakthrough"" on her campaign website and recounting how she and Obama were ""hunting down the Chinese"" to get them to the table. She devotes a significant chunk of a chapter in her 2014 memoir, Hard Choices, to the talks. She notes the role of Todd Stern, a key negotiator, as well as her and Obama’s famous tag-team chase to find the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiaobao during the talks. ""In a makeshift conference room whose glass walls had been covered by drapes for privacy against prying eyes, we found Wen wedged around a long table with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and South African President Jacob Zuma. Jaws dropped when they saw us. 'Are you ready?' said President Obama, flashing a big grin,"" Clinton writes. ""Now the real negotiations could begin. It was a moment that was at least a year in the making."" But according to news reports, world leaders, environmental activists and experts, the ""real negotiations"" didn’t actually lead to anything with teeth. China and India did end up agreeing to reduce their emissions and set their own targets, but emphasized the pledge was not legally binding. This basically changed the international approach to climate action from Kyoto Protocol, which had a compliance mechanism, to ""a voluntary approach where countries are free to determine unilaterally what forms of action they would like to commit to,"" said Ciplet. ""Many, including myself, saw this as a much weaker mitigation framework than a robust second commitment period to the Kyoto Protocol,"" he said, adding that even after the Paris Agreement, ""we are still not on track"" in mitigating climate change.   Our ruling Bill Clinton said Hillary Clinton ""negotiated the first agreement — ever — where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions."" Clinton was at the table at the Copenhagen Accord, though she wasn’t the only U.S. official present. And while it was the first time China and India made pledges in an international agreement, their pledges were not legally binding. Many, if not most, environmentalists and experts say the agreement was a wash at best and a failure at worst.

Donald Trump gets a Full Flop for stance on minimum wage
","During a press conference in Florida while Democrats were preparing for the third night of their national convention in Philadelphia, Donald Trump was asked a question about his stance on whether to raise the minimum wage. Here’s what he said: ""The minimum wage has to go up. People are -- at least $10, but it has to go up. But I think that states -- federal -- I think that states should really call the shot. As an example, I live in New York. It's very expensive in New York. You can't buy a hot dog for the money you're talking about. You go to other states and it's not expensive at all. Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up, companies move out and things, bad things happen. At the same time, people have to be taken care of. But what I'm really going to do on the minimum wage -- but it has to go up.. .. So I would like to raise it to at least $10."" A journalist then followed up, ""You said we need to raise it to $10. … Are you talking about the federal minimum wage?"" Trump confirmed, ""Federal."" Some saw the Florida remarks as a change to Trump’s previous position on whether there should be a federal minimum wage floor for the entire country. Were they? Before we go any further, let’s recap how the minimum wage works in the United States. There is a federal minimum wage -- currently $7.25 -- that serves as a floor beneath which no state’s minimum wage can fall. Any states, however, can set their minimum wage level higher than $7.25. (There are exceptions to the $7.25 minimum wage level for some workers, such as those who survive heavily on tips.) The clearest counterpoint to Trump’s Florida comments came from an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press on May 8. We cited this exchange in our July 8 fact check, in which we gave a True rating to an assertion by Hillary Clinton that Trump ""wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage."" In the fact-check, we noted that Trump told NBC’s Chuck Todd that he preferred that states -- not the federal government -- act on their own to raise the minimum wage. ""I would like to see an increase of some magnitude,"" Trump told Todd. ""But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don't forget, the states have to compete with each other."" When Todd asked specifically, ""Should the federal government set a floor"" for the minimum wage?"" Trump replied, ""No. I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do."" Now, fast-forward nearly three months to Trump’s Florida news conference. His comments at the news conference seemed to embrace a national rise in the minimum wage -- specifically, he said, ""The minimum wage has to go up. ... at least $10, but it has to go up."" And he clarified that that meant, ""federal."" That’s a clearer commitment to hiking the minimum wage for every American than Trump had made in his comments to Todd. At the same time, though, Trump also said, ""I think that states should really call the shot."" This essentially kept Trump’s focus on the states acting on their own. Trump’s apparent advocacy for a national $10 minimum wage in his Florida comments does go further than some of his other prior statements on the issue. • In an interview with MSNBC in August 2015, Trump said, ""Having a low minimum wage is not a bad thing for this country."" • During the Republican debate in Milwaukee in November 2015, Trump said wages are ""too high"" and, when asked whether he would raise the minimum wage, said, ""I would not do it."" • On ABC’s This Week on May 8, 2016, host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump, ""Minimum wage -- all through the primaries, you were against an increase. Now you're saying you're looking at it. So what's your bottom line on this?"" Trump responded, ""Well, I am looking at it and I haven't decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more."" When Stephanopoulos asked whether that’s a change, Trump answered, ""Well, sure it's a change. I'm allowed to change. You need flexibility."" A final note: Trump’s most recent comments on the issue were a brief exchange in a longer press conference. It’s possible he may adjust his views again in the future. Trump’s press office did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling On the question of whether the federal government should set a minimum wage, Trump seems to have made a shift between his Meet the Press comments and his Florida news conference. In the Meet the Press interview, Trump explicitly said he doesn’t want the federal government raising, or even setting, the minimum wage floor. By contrast, in the Florida news conference, he said the ""federal"" minimum wage ""has to go up."" Trump emphasized in both instances that he prefers the states to raise their minimum wages on their own, so it’s fair to say that Trump is sending conflicting messages. Still, his contrast on the question of a federal minimum wage hike is pretty stark. We rate this a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2016/jul/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-gets-full-flop-stance-minimum-wage/
"['Ohio', 'Campaign Finance', 'Elections', 'Sherrod Brown']","
Are Koch-backed groups spending most for Ohio Senate race?
","Voters in Ohio are enduring a deluge of fundraising emails from political groups ahead of the November election, like one from Friends of Sherrod Brown. The senator, in the middle of his second term, is hoping to garner support for fellow Democrat Ted Strickland. ""Outside special interests like to spend money in Ohio,"" Brown’s email said. ""Back in 2012, they spent $40 million trying to buy my seat in the Senate. … Right now, the special interests are up to $30 million spent against Ted -- with the Koch network spending more money in Ohio than anywhere else in the country.""   Strickland, the former Ohio governor, is running for Senate against incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman in one of the tightest races in the country. The billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, of Koch Industries, are tied as the sixth-richest people in the world, each worth an estimated $42 billion. As political and policy influencers advancing a free-market agenda, their network includes the nonprofit Americans for Prosperity and the super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund The Kochs can usually be counted on to fund conservative causes, but they have recoiled from the 2016 presidential race. Is down-ballot spending in Ohio the Koch’s biggest imprint so far in the 2016 elections? We turned first to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics for its tallies of outside contributions. The Koch brothers, through their political action network, have spent approximately $8 million in the senate race in Ohio, with almost $2 million from Americans for Prosperity and a little over $6 million from Freedom Partners Action Fund. That is more than the Koch-backed groups have spent in any other race in the country, according to OpenSecrets records. The Koch network’s next-largest spending, by comparison, is in North Carolina, where Americans for Prosperity has spent a mere $200,000 against Rep. Renee Ellmers, and in Pennsylvania, where Freedom Partners Action Fund has spent almost $3 million in opposition to Katie McGinty. In opposition spending by Freedom Partners, Strickland has ""taken the most punishment"" in 2016 to date, the Center for Responsive Politics reported. So the Koch network is contributing substantially to help Portman keep his seat. But where did Brown get the ""$30 million spent against Ted""? Here are the numbers for outside spending contributions in the Ohio senate race, according to OpenSecrets.org:  If you add the total outside spending for Portman, and the spending against Strickland, you get $19,232,784. (We’re leaving out the primary race spending for the other Democratic candidate, P.G. Sittenfeld, who Strickland beat -- that’s the difference between our total and the $19,990,270 above.) Where does the other $10 million come from? Strickland spokesman David Bergstein told PolitiFact Ohio that, in tracking money spent against the candidate, the campaign monitors announcements of advertising purchases, some of which come from 501(c)(4) organizations that don’t have to report to the Federal Election Commission. Those dollars, therefore, don’t appear on sites like OpenSecrets.org. Counting announcements of spending from these nonprofits, the conservative estimate is closer to $30 million, the campaign said. Bergstein provided a spreadsheet confirming that figure. Strickland’s campaign isn’t suffering from a lack of outside spending as much as Brown’s email might suggest. Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC dedicated to putting Democrats in Senate seats, has spent $8.4 million against Portman and $1.8 million for Strickland. We shared our analysis with Freedom Partners Action PAC, and the group did not dispute our findings. Our ruling A fundraising email in support of Strickland said that the billionaire-backed Koch network has devoted the most money to oppose the Ohio senate candidate than in any other race in the country. Americans for Prosperity and the Freedom Partners Action Fund have spent about $8 million to oppose Strickland, which is more than they’ve dropped in any other race this election season to date. Strickland’s campaign, while hardly immune to special interests, is the Koch network’s biggest target in an election year that has seen conservative benefactors steer clear of the main ticket.   We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2016/jul/28/sherrod-brown/are-koch-backed-groups-spending-most-ohio-senate-r/
"['Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Donald Trump']","
 Donald Trump says Tim Kaine proposed $4 billion tax increase during first week as governor
","Donald Trump told Virginians this week that Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, did a ""lousy job"" when he was governor of their state. ""Less than a week after Tim Kaine became governor of Virginia - one week - he proposed a nearly $4 billion tax increase, $4 billion, including a tax increase on people earning as little as $17,000 a year,"" Trump said during a rally Monday in Roanoke. We decided to see whether Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, was right about Kaine’s record. The Trump campaign didn’t respond for our request for backing to his  claim. Trump has, however, posted source materials on his campaign website that takes aim at Kaine’s fiscal record as governor from 2006 to 2010. The $4 billion Six days after taking office in January 2006, Kaine proposed an unsuccessful measure to raise $1 billion a year to deal with long-standing transportation woes. Trump’s campaign points to a next-day article in The Washington Post that said the plan would generate close to $4 billion by the time Kaine’s term ended in 2010. Kaine wanted to raise taxes on auto insurance and vehicle purchases in addition to increasing car registration fees. But not all of Kaine’s plan relied on raising broad taxes. About 15 percent of the revenue, or $150 million a year, would have come from assessing steep new fines on people who have chronically bad driving records. It’s a bit of a stretch to call those fines a tax, because those payments easily could have been avoided by following traffic laws. Taxing low incomes There’s no doubt that the tax and fee increases Kaine proposed in 2006 would have affected all Virginia car owners, including those earning as little as $17,000 or even less. Oddly, Trump may have had something entirely different in mind when he cited the $17,000. His campaign website uses that income threshold in referring to a proposal Kaine made at the end of his governorship, not the beginning. Kaine proposed another ill-fated tax increase in December 2009, his last full month as governor. At the time, Virginia’s economy was reeling from the shocks of the Great Recession. Kaine proposed raising state income tax rates for all brackets by 1 percentage point. The proposed tax increase - defeated in the first week after Kaine left office in 2010 - would have raised about $1.9 billion. That would have been offset by $650 million taxpayers would have saved by a Kaine proposal to eliminate Virginia’s personal property tax on vehicles. So the net effect of Kaine’s last-year plan would have been a $1.25 billion annual tax hike. PolitiFact Virginia, in 2012, looked into a claim that Kaine, during his last year, tried to raise taxes on people ""earning as little as $17,000."" It was made by Republican George Allen, whom Kaine defeated that year in a U.S. Senate race. We concluded that many, but not all, households with taxable incomes of $17,000 would have paid more taxes under Kaine’s proposal. But in some cases, if a person had a pretty good vehicle, his savings on the car tax repeal would have outweighed his increased income tax bill under Kaine’s plan. Kaine’s 2009 proposal actually would have affected Virginians with less than a $17,000 taxable income. At the time, Virginia required all individuals with taxable incomes of more than $11,950 to file state income taxes. Trump, we should note, altered his tax criticism of Kaine after he left Virginia. ""First thing Tim Kaine did was have a $4 billion tax increase,"" he said Wednesday during a news conference at the Trump National Doral resort in Florida. In this instance, Trump didn’t link Kaine’s 2006 tax-hike proposal to people with low incomes. Our ruling Trump said Kaine, during his first week as governor, proposed a ""nearly $4 billion tax increase"" that would have hit people earning as little as $17,000. Kaine, six days after taking office in 2006, did propose a plan to raise about $1 billion a year for transportation. Trump calls it a ""nearly $4 billion tax increase,"" citing a figure used in a newspaper article at the time. But the article said that sum would be realized over four years. Trump, in using that high $4 billion figure, omits the clarifying time span. The tax package centered on raising levies on auto insurance and vehicle purchases in addition to increasing car registration fees. It would have affected people with taxable incomes of $17,000 or lower - if they had a car. So Trump’s statement largely is accurate but needs some clarification. We rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/528b42df-6b46-432f-8de0-34061afc6b13",/factchecks/2016/jul/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-tim-kaine-proposed-4-billion-tax/
"['Immigration', 'Nevada', 'Catherine Cortez Masto']","
Nevada Senate candidate not 'ideological soul mate' of Donald Trump
","National and state Democrats are trying to tie Nevada Republican Senate candidate Joe Heck to the controversial immigration policies of Donald Trump,including Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto. In a recent news release, Cortez Masto’s campaign called the two Republicans ""ideological soul mates."" ""Just on the issue of immigration alone, it is next to impossible to find a policy difference between Trump and Congressman Heck,"" stated Cortez Masto’s release. With immigration being a top concern for Nevada’s sizable Hispanic population, we thought it was worth comparing the two candidates to see if it really is ""next to impossible"" to find a policy difference. Priorities On the surface level, there are many policy differences on immigration between Heck and Trump. Trump’s immigration platform is detailed on his campaign website, and centers around three topics previously distilled by PolitiFact: Build a border wall across the U.S.-Mexico border, and require Mexico to make a one-time $5 to $10 billion payment to pay for it. Increase enforcement of immigration laws, including ending birthright citizenship and ending funding for so-called sanctuary cities. Focus on American workers, including halting green cards for foreign workers until more domestic workers are hired and increasing the minimum prevailing wage for H-1B visa program recipients. Heck’s campaign and House websites acknowledge a ""broken"" immigration system but focus on different policy solutions. While echoing Trump in calling for implementing a mandatory E-verify system for employers and calling for increased border security, Heck says he’s open to granting citizenship or legal status to people not legally in the country if his other proposals are addressed in a ""meaningful"" way. Both campaigns sent lengthy responses to PolitiFact. One thing is clear: There is daylight between Heck and Trump on a number of immigration policies. Birthright citizenship Democrats claim Heck and Trump share identical positions on wanting to ""end birthright citizenship and repeal the 14th Amendment."" It’s true both Republicans have mentioned re-examining the concept of jus soli — extending citizenship based on place of birth, not parental nationality — but Heck and Trump differ on rhetoric. Trump explicitly calls for an end to the policy, calling it the ""biggest magnet for illegal immigration."" (He also cites Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid’s 1993 bill ""clarifying"" the concept, though Reid later called it the ""low point"" of his legislative career.) Heck has also called for a similar re-examination of the policy, but in a less direct tone. His most pointed comments came in 2012, where a tracker captured Heck saying he supported changing the concept. ""My personal opinion is that if you’re gonna be a citizen – be considered a citizen – you should be born to at least one parent that’s a U.S. citizen,"" he said at the time. Heck generally hasn’t gone as far since then, most recently telling a Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter that ""it needs to be part of the discussion"" but stopping short of a full endorsement. Legal scholars generally agree that birthright citizenship is on solid constitutional ground, but several believe it would only take a congressional act to ""clarify"" citizenship for children born of people not legally in the United States, and point out that the court has never fully adjudicated the issue. 2013 immigration bill Cortez Masto says Heck and Trump both opposed the 2013 bipartisan immigration legislation, commonly referred to as the ""Gang of Eight"" bill. That glosses over important parts of the story. In 2013, Heck described the legislation as having positives and negatives but ultimately said he’d vote against the Senate bill as written, pointing to concerns over border security and wanting to toughen the education requirements for the children of people not legally in the country looking to apply for citizenship. The bill never received a House vote, but Heck still took independent action on the immigration bill. The Republican worked on draft legislation providing a pathway to citizenship for people illegally brought into the country as children, and publicly criticized House leadership in 2013 for failing to vote on any immigration legislation. Trump, on the other hand, told Bloomberg that he only really started following the immigration debate since he started running for president in 2015. ""When I made my (announcement) speech at Trump Tower, the June 16 speech, I didn’t know about the Gang of Eight. … I just knew instinctively that our borders are a mess,"" he said in May. This is contradicted by several tweets and interviews Trump did in 2013, calling the legislation a ""death wish"" for the Republican Party. Trump later criticized primary rival Marco Rubio’s involvement in the legislation, calling it ""nothing more than a giveaway to the corporate patrons who run both parties."" DREAMers/DACA One of Heck’s most notable forays into the immigration debate was a failed attempt to bring forward a Republican version of the long-languishing Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act. Heck worked for around six months to try to find a compromise path supported by both parties, businesses and immigration activists before trying to roll out the measure in December 2013. Heck’s version of the legislation, which had a pathway to citizenship for immigrants brought unlawfully into the country as children, fell flat after immigration activists and several other stakeholders declined to back the proposal over concerns that it only addressed part of the problem and wanted to hold out for a more comprehensive immigration plan. Additionally, Heck has voted against funding for Obama’s executive orders allowing undocumented children and their parents to receive work permits and exemptions from deportation. He’s on the record voting for several amendments that would strip the program’s funding and voted in 2015 to block funding for an expansion of the program while joining with 25 other House Republicans to support the existing program. In the past, Heck has tried to frame his mixed voting record on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals in terms of his stated opposition to the president’s use of executive orders establishing the programs. Trump is clearly opposed to the issue, and in 2015 called for the full rescission of executive orders protecting DREAMers from deportation, as well as the mass deportation of the roughly 11 million people not legally in the country. He’s also publicly opposed the DREAM Act itself. Heck has routinely called Trump’s proposals unrealistic. ""I don’t think they can find, round up and afford to deport 11 million people,"" he told reporters in March. The wall/border security Heck also differs on Trump’s signature piece of immigration policy — building a massive border wall with Mexico. The Heck campaign provided PolitiFact with a form letter sent to constituents who ask about the proposed border wall. The letter stresses Heck’s commitment to border security while gently dismissing Trump’s plan for a massive, thousand-mile concrete wall as being inefficient. ""Physical barriers are certainly effective in areas with high cross-border traffic; however, there are vast stretches of our border that have relatively few crossings, and preventing these crossings could be more easily achieved through other methods,"" he says in the letter. Part of Heck’s stated reasoning for opposing the 2013 immigration bill had to do with border security — the Republican specifically called for additional border fencing and for more manpower along the border to stop illegal crossings. H1-B visas Trump and Heck also differ on what to do with temporary H1-B visas for skilled foreign workers. Trump’s plan explicitly calls to increase the minimum prevailing wage (an averaged wage paid to workers in a similar field) for H1-B recipients over fears that the program depresses wages for American workers. It also makes an unspecified point of forcing companies to hire American workers before foreign workers in the visa program. Heck’s campaign provided PolitiFact with a form letter sent to voters who ask about limiting the visas, which details Heck’s concerns that scaling back the program could hurt economic growth. ""By restricting H-1B visas, growth in the U.S. in STEM fields could be restricted,"" Heck says in the letter. Sanctuary cities Another area of immigration policy overlap for Trump and Heck is in defunding so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" or areas where local law enforcement doesn’t routinely report undocumented migrants to immigration authorities. There’s no agreed-upon or legal definition of a ""sanctuary city,"" and use of the moniker is somewhat fluid. Trump seized the issue after the shooting death of Kate Steinle in San Francisco last year by an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times, and has forcefully called for cutting off federal grants to cities that refuse to cooperate with federal law enforcement. While he hasn’t been as vocal as Trump, Heck did vote to block federal law enforcement funds from sanctuary cities as part of a House bill in July 2015. The White House promised to veto the measure, which has defeated in a procedural vote by Senate Democrats. Our ruling Cortez Masto claims that ""on the issue of immigration alone, it is next to impossible to find a policy difference between (Donald) Trump and Congressman (Joe) Heck."" There are areas where Heck and Trump overlap on immigration policy: mandatory E-verify for employers, upping border security and questioning birthright citizenship. However, Cortez Masto made it sound like Heck and Trump are lockstep on the issue, and that's clearly not the case. There are major stated policy differences between the two Republicans — Heck opposes mass deportation, which Trump campaigned on during the primary season. And Heck has supported a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country, as well as supported a version of the DREAM Act. It wasn't ""next to impossible"" to find those differences. We rate this statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/311dcdb1-c61d-47a8-a370-327fe6ef5998",/factchecks/2016/jul/28/catherine-cortez-masto/nevada-senate-candidate-not-ideological-soul-mate-/

Rendell ‘not one for name-calling’; SOBs, idiots, wusses beg to differ

McGinty apologized for the comment hours after saying it, at a Communications Workers of America union event Monday. Rendell told Politico reporter Burgess Everett her remarks were ""probably a little extreme."" ""I love Katie, but I’m not one for name calling,"" he said. ""I think there’s too much disrespect in the business."" He also said that she responded correctly in apologizing. Is Rendell truly ""not one for name calling?"" It’s tough to agree. We vividly remember the time he name-called the whole country. This was back in 2010, after the NFL bumped a late December Eagles home game against the Minnesota Vikings from a Sunday to a Tuesday due to weather. ""We've become a nation of wusses. The Chinese are kicking our butt in everything,"" he told a local radio station. ""If this was in China do you think the Chinese would have called off the game? People would have been marching down to the stadium, they would have walked and they would have been doing calculus on the way down."" After his comments went viral, Rendell not only stuck to his guns, in 2012 he published a book on the topic: A Nation of Wusses: How America's Leaders Lost the Guts to Make Us Great. Wuss appears to be a common word in the Rendell lexicon. He called Chris Christie one in 2014 for rooting for the Cowboys. In 2012, he called then-Virginia Gov. Bob McConnell one for not voicing support for a ban on semiautomatic weapons. ""I like Gov. McDonnell and think he does some good things, but he is being nothing but a coward and a wuss when he won’t confront the question,"" he stated on MSNBC. That same year, the Wall Street Journal and Boston Globe reported that despite condemning stimulus funding, Paul Ryan had actually requested some.

""Had Paul Ryan read my book, he would not have made [this] mistake he made on the campaign."" It’s also hard to forget when, in 2011, Rendell didn’t appreciate some of ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Leslie Stahl’s questions. She was asking whether gambling legalization could have a poor influence on gambling addicts. Rendell reacted: ""You’re not getting it. Those people would lose that money anyway.

Mostly False: Claim that as Texas mayor, Julián Castro got big referral fee from 'notorious' lawyer
","San Antonio golden boy Julián Castro shot to national attention as a possible running mate for Hillary Clinton. Among observers, Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak, former vice chair of the Travis County Republican Party, wrote that Texas would be proud to have one of its own (even a Democrat) again serving as vice president. Then again, Mackowiak called the U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development and former mayor of the Alamo City ""unquestionably unqualified."" ""Perhaps most seriously,"" Mackowiak said in a July 2016 commentary published in the Austin American-Statesman before Castro fell out of consideration, ""how Castro earned a living while serving as mayor will come under intense scrutiny. In 2009, his first year as mayor, Castro received a seven-figure referral fee from notorious personal injury lawyer Mikal Watts, a major Obama donor. What Castro did to earn this fee, which smells like a dirty financial gift from a wealthy trial lawyer to a sitting elected official, will receive a lot of attention — especially since Watts was indicted on federal fraud charges in 2015."" That sounds call-the-authorities seamy. We sought to check the facts, confirming that Castro, who is a lawyer, once received a reportedly substantial referral fee from Watts. But the matter played out when Castro was in private practice, a couple years before he became mayor. Castro and Watts Timeline: Castro served as mayor of San Antonio from 2009 until 2014 when President Barack Obama picked him to join his cabinet. Prior to 2009, Castro was a San Antonio City Council member from 2001 to 2005, the year he lost his first bid for mayor to Phil Hardberger. It was after that loss that Castro worked as a trial lawyer in private practice and, news stories state, referred a client to Watts, a well-known San Antonio personal-injury lawyer. More recently, as Mackowiak wrote, Watts was indicted for allegedly faking the number of clients he represented with claims against BP Oil after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, according to an Oct. 21, 2015, San Antonio Express-News article, with some counts later dropped.  Watts also has been a major Democratic donor. A Nov. 5, 2008, Wall Street Journal news article says 10 partners, including Watts, raised $285,000 for Obama during this first run, with Watts personally contributing $28,500. The newspaper classified Watts as a ""mega-bundler."" (Bundlers for candidates are people who reach their individual contribution caps and then look to others to write checks to candidates, generating a big bundle.) In 2012, Watts was listed as an Obama bundler by Open Secrets, the website run by the Center for Responsive Politics that tracks federal campaign contributions. According to the Express-News story, in July 2012 Watts hosted an event where more than 1,200 people paid $250 each to see Obama. Later that month, Watts hosted 75 guests in his home for a private, $35,800-a-plate Obama fundraiser. Mackowiak cites 'seed money' story We asked Mackowiak the basis of his seems-dirty-for-the-mayor ""seven-figure"" claim. By email, he noted two articles, starting with a May 18, 2014, news story about Castro’s rise in the Washington Examiner, a right-leaning weekly magazine and website. That story doesn’t say Castro fielded a big fee while serving as mayor. It does say the ""seed money for Castro's time in the mayor's office -- he was first elected in 2009 -- was a controversial seven-figure ‘referral fee’ that Castro, a Harvard-educated lawyer, received from a well-connected trial lawyer and Democratic donor in a personal injury lawsuit in which Castro may or may not have played a major role."" After a 2006 accident left three people dead, the story says, a survivor chose Castro’s law firm to represent him against the drunk driver of an oilfield services truck involved in the accident--and Castro referred the ""case"" to Watts and his larger firm. The story says Watts then ""won the case, and a big award and Castro was paid a seven-figure ‘referral fee’ for bringing the suit to Watts' firm."" The figure hasn’t been disclosed, the story says, while Castro and Watts have said Castro ""played an important role in the case."" An Oct. 22, 2015 commentary by Gilbert Garcia of the Express-News, also noted by Mackowiak, credits the ""reported seven-figure referral fee"" with giving Castro lasting financial stability. San Antonio client: Castro 'a good lawyer' Next, we found coverage of the described fee in Express-News news stories indicating that Castro indeed accepted a sizable referral fee from Watts--about two years before Castro won his first term as mayor. The fee came up the first time in a front-page story published March 22, 2009, less than two months before Castro won election. At the time, per the story, Castro opponents questioned the sourcing of a $215,000 personal loan Castro had made to his campaign the summer before. According to that news report, around Christmas 2006, members of a Mexico-bound San Antonio family died in a wreck involving a drunken-driving suspect. The father of the family, Enrique Mayoral, survived but lost his mother, wife and youngest son, the story said. Mayoral told the newspaper that after the accident, he was besieged by lawyers trying to pick up his case -- some knocking on his door and offering cash -- but he liked the idea of hiring Castro, who seemed trustworthy and connected. Mayoral said he knew Castro through connections in the Edgewood neighborhood where Castro grew up, and when a close family friend suggested that Castro could help him, he took that advice. Mayoral went on to say Castro led an active role in the case, attending attorney-client meetings and taking him to appointments because Mayoral, who had suffered a stroke two years earlier, was unable to drive. ""He was a good lawyer and he knew the people who could help me in this case,"" Mayoral said. ""He was always with me, right there. If I had a question, he got the answer. I was glad he was on my side."" The legal battle was expected to be costly since the drunken-driver suspect had been in a vehicle owned by an oilfield services company so, according to the story, Castro said he did what many small legal practices do by referring the case to a bigger firm and turning to Watts. Castro told the paper he continued to help Mayoral's cause by working on his original court petition and doing background research, also joining mediation and settlement negotiations. The story said the fee was paid after the suit was settled in June 2007. Undisclosed fee amount The dollar amount of the fee isn’t stated in any of seven stories we found and wasn’t disclosed, several stories say, due to a confidentiality agreement. A judge, the March 2009 story said, sealed related records. Otherwise, then-mayoral hopeful Trish DeBerry-Mejia was quoted in the March 2009 article saying: ""Mr. Castro professes to be a man of the people, but how many people have seven-figure referral fees dropped in their laps?"" Later, according to an April 2009 Express-News story, DeBerry-Mejia (who didn’t respond to our inquiry) said the fee was $1 million. Our search for other relevant accounts didn’t turn up anything and when we reached Watts, he said by phone he couldn’t confirm the amount due to the confidentiality agreement. We also didn’t draw fresh comment from Castro. By email, a HUD spokesman, Jaime Castillo, told us only that the reported fee didn’t relate to HUD business. We reached out to Mackowiak to share that the fee he associated with Castro’s time as mayor was evidently earned and paid years before. Mackowiak suggested the fee still proved vital for Castro to resume his political career, also saying: ""If I got the year wrong, then I admit the error. If you think he ‘worked’ for that enormous referral fee, then you must also believe in the tooth fairy."" Our ruling Mackowiak wrote that as mayor, Castro received a seven-figure referral fee that smells like a dirty gift from Obama donor and personal-injury lawyer Mikal Watts. We find that Watts once paid a hefty referral fee to Castro’s law firm--the amount undisclosed. Mackowiak’s declaration that Castro shadily landed the fee while he was mayor, though, doesn’t stand up. All told, we see an element of truth about the legal referral, but Mackowiak was critically wrong about timing — a distinction that puts his statement in a different light. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.",/factchecks/2016/jul/28/matt-mackowiak/mostly-false-claim-texas-mayor-julian-castro-got-b/
"['Poverty', 'Illinois', 'John Shimkus']","
Shimkus shortens War on Poverty, crunches soggy data to make a point
","Few things in American politics have been more hotly and consistently argued in the last half-century than the legacy of President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty. In a 1986 speech on welfare reform, President Ronald Reagan took several jabs at Johnson’s initiative, saying: ""[When] the famous War on Poverty was declared... a funny thing happened. Poverty, as measured by dependency, stopped shrinking and then actually began to grow worse. I guess you could say, poverty won the war."" Today, the bipartisan debate continues. Democrats and Republicans argue whether welfare programs work and if the poverty rate actually shrank since Johnson declared the War on Poverty.   On June 7, U.S. Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., tweeted:  Shimkus was promoting House Speaker Paul Ryan’s ""A Better Way"" agenda that looks at, among other things, poverty and welfare reform. But just as America has changed since the Johnson administration, so has the way the government measures poverty. Does Shimkus take those changes into consideration in his tweet? We decided to investigate his claims about the nation’s poverty record and how much it has changed since the War on Poverty was declared. First off, what is poverty? Every year the United States Census Bureau updates the thresholds it uses to define the official poverty rate. The thresholds help the Bureau when it gathers statistics for its annual report on income and poverty. Here are the key things to know about those thresholds: Using the Consumer Price index, thresholds are updated based on the country’s inflation rate. The same poverty calculation is used across the country regardless of a person’s location, which means the same criteria is used for a person living in New York City or Peoria. The Bureau looks at income before taxes and doesn’t include non-cash benefits like public housing, Medicaid and food stamps.   In 2010, the Census Bureau also started producing the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), which takes into account place of residence, government benefits and necessary expenses like taxes. The SPM offers another perspective on poverty, calculating the factors missed in the official poverty report. (See a side-by-side comparison of the SPM and official rates here.) A deeper dive into poverty Shimkus press secretary Jordan Haverly told PolitiFact Illinois that Shimkus pulled the data for his tweet from page 5 of the ""A Better Way"" guide, which shows an overview of the welfare system. The graph below shows the data in the ""A Better Way"" guide is consistent to that of the Census Bureau.   The vertical stripes in the charts represent periods of recession.  ""A Better Way,"" Page 5   Shimkus' tweet says that 14 percent of Americans lived in poverty at the dawn of the War on Poverty and 14 percent still do. It’s meant to show the country’s poverty situation hasn’t made much progress more than five decades after the declaration after the War on Poverty began. A surface-level look into the Census Bureau data from 1966 to 2014 backs that claim. However, many researchers consider the methods used by the Bureau to be outdated, and say its studies do not accurately reflect the poverty rate in the United States. If given the option, 90 percent of academics and researchers would favor a move away from the reliance on the official poverty rate data, according to Timothy Smeeding, the Lee Rainwater Distinguished Professor of Public Affairs and Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Smeeding said because the Supplemental Poverty Measure takes into account government contributions when determining whether a person is poor, it’s better for tracking the number of poverty-stricken people in the country than the official rate. ""The SPM is a measurement that takes a look at all the things we think are important, all the things we spend money on,"" Smeeding said. ""The official rate doesn’t make a lot of sense. But if you want to say the War on Poverty is a failure, then take a look at the official numbers."" Smeeding said politicians are often more comfortable with the official rate, especially if their state gets a lot of government funding because of it. ""No politician would ever pitch a move to the SPM because it might mean the state’s poverty level would decrease and they would get less money,"" Smeeding said.   A  2013 study by Columbia University backs that claim. Researchers found if the Bureau incorporated government programs into the official poverty rate, the rate would have significantly decreased over time. Using historical data, the Columbia researchers found the poverty rate would have fallen from 26 percent in 1967 to 16 percent in 2012 if the Bureau used the SPM. Shimkus’ tweet only uses the Census Bureau’s data. The numbers and Shimkus’ wording  Shimkus said the poverty rate was 14 percent when Johnson declared the War on Poverty, and the poverty rate was still 14 percent 50 years later. The wording could be confusing to someone unfamiliar with the history of the War on Poverty. First, Shimkus’ tweet implies Johnson started the War on Poverty exactly 50 years ago. Johnson actually declared the War on Poverty in 1964 during his State of the Union Address, which was 52 years ago. Second, in 1966 the poverty rate was 14 percent, but at the time of Johnson’s 1964 address, the poverty rate was 19 percent. Our ruling  Shimkus said, ""When LBJ started #WarOnPoverty, 14% of Americans lived in poverty. 50 years later, 14 percent still do. There’s a #BetterWay Shimkus isn’t wrong saying the current poverty rate is 14 percent, according to the most recent data. But the figures in his tweet come from a measurement standard most researchers regard as obsolete. A more accurate and widely-accepted gauge of poverty is the Supplemental Poverty Measure, though neither Shimkus’ tweet nor House Speaker Ryan’s ""A Better Way"" acknowledge it. There’s also a problem with Shimkus’ timeframe. The War on Poverty began in 1964, but the tweet implies it dates only to 1966. Even using the obsolete Census Bureau ""poverty rate"" measure, there’s a 5 percentage point difference between 1964’s 19 percent and the 14 percent figure of 50 years ago in 1966. By that measure, the rate dropped 5 percentage points. Finally, his tweet implies the poverty rate remained stagnant from 1966 to today. As shown in the graph above, the poverty rate continuously has spiked and dipped over the past 50 years, with the sharpest increases coming during periods of recession.   We rate this claim Mostly False",/factchecks/2016/jul/28/john-shimkus/shimkus-shortens-war-poverty-make-point/

Did Donald Trump promise mass deportation of 'Latino families'?
","U.S. Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has achieved one thing in the Democrats’ favor: He has united them with divisive policies. ""Donald Trump, when you take pride in your outright ignorance of world affairs, when you promise the mass deportation of Latino families, when you dismiss officer-involved shootings of African-Americans, when you degrade women, Donald Trump, you unite us,"" Bass said on the third night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. That prompted us to revisit Trump’s comments about immigrants and deportations. Bass said Trump has promised to deport Latino families, but only characterizing those families as ""Latino"" misses an important distinction in Trump’s plans. Trump has promised to deport undocumented immigrants. Not all Latinos in the country are undocumented, and not all undocumented immigrants are Latino. That said, the majority of undocumented immigrants are from Latin American countries. Pew Research Center’s most recent estimates pegged the number of unauthorized immigrants in the nation at 11.3 million, or about 3.5 percent of the U.S. population. Mexicans account for about half of the unauthorized population, according to Pew. So what exactly has Trump said about mass deportations? Earlier on in his campaign, Trump said he would round up ""in a very humane way"" the millions of undocumented immigrants in the country and send them back to their native countries. In an interview that aired in September 2015 on CBS’ 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley pressed Trump about what he would do with the population. Pelley: ""Eleven, 12 million illegal immigrants --"" Trump: ""Or whatever the number is."" Pelley: ""Still in the country, what do you do?"" Trump: ""If they've done well, they're going out and they're coming back in legally. Because you said it--"" Pelley: ""You're rounding them all up?"" Trump: ""We're rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way. And they're going to be happy because they want to be legalized. And, by the way, I know it doesn't sound nice. But not everything is nice."" Trump has also discussed having a ""deportation force"" to remove undocumented immigrants from the country, though he’s also said he would let some come back legally. Trump stuck to the deportation plan for all undocumented immigrants in some of the GOP primary debates. During the CNN/Telemundo debate on Feb. 25, 2016, host Wolf Blitzer asked about his deportation force idea and whether his plan to let ""good ones"" back in amounted to amnesty. Trump said ""we either have a country, or we don’t have a country."" ""We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally,"" he continued. ""They will go out. They will come back -- some will come back, the best, through a process. They have to come back legally. They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that's very fair, and very fine. They're going to get in line with other people."" In March, Fox host Megyn Kelly asked Trump whether he told the New York Times editorial board in an off-the-record interview that he was ""flexible"" on his deportation plan. Trump said, ""Not very flexible. No, not very flexible. ...  But there's always give and take. ... But we need give and take in government. If you don't have give and take, you're never going to agree on anything."" Change of heart? So Trump clearly has said he would seek to remove the 11 million or more undocumented immigrants. But he also has suggested he may be softening that position, without offering specifics. On a recent trip to Scotland, Trump said President Barack Obama ""has mass deported vast numbers of people -- the most ever"" and that Trump would have ""not only the best policies, but I will have the biggest heart of anybody,"" Bloomberg Politics reported June 25. He said he would not label his approach ""mass deportations."" ""No, I would not call it mass deportations,"" Trump told Bloomberg Politics. He said he would ""get rid of a lot of bad dudes who are here."" Trump’s campaign website contains no mention of deporting the entire undocumented population. Instead it focuses on the mandatory return of criminal aliens and nationwide use of the E-verify system, among other policies. Our ruling Bass said Trump has ""promised mass deportation of Latino families."" Off the bat, Bass’ attack is imprecise. She said Trump wants to deport Latino families, when he has not promised that exactly. He pledged to remove the undocumented population, which is certainly comprised of Latinos but is not exclusive to them. (And obviously, not all Latinos in the United States are here illegally.) The underlying issue is tough talk Trump offered earlier in his campaign about rounding up undocumented immigrants in the country and sending them back to their native countries — with the ""good ones"" able to come back, possibly. Trump reiterated that stance several times as journalists asked how it would work. But the Republican presidential nominee appears to have recently softened his view over the last month, and his official immigration plans don’t mention deporting undocumented families en masse.

Mostly True: Obama says world opinion of U.S. better now than eight years ago
","President Barack Obama invoked his characteristic themes of hope and unity at the Democratic National Convention, countering what he called Donald Trump’s ""pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against each other."" Whereas Obama touted Hillary Clinton as having earned the respect of leaders around the world and experts at home, he rebuked Trump’s isolationism and more unconventional foreign policy positions and proposals. ""He cozies up to Putin, praises Saddam Hussein, and tells the NATO allies that stood by our side after 9/11 that they have to pay up if they want our protection,"" Obama said. ""Well, America’s promises do not come with a price tag. We meet our commitments. That’s one of the reasons why almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago when I took office."" Does the world really like us more now than they did eight years ago? The White House referred us to our own archives and a fact-check of former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson. Carlson claimed that most polls show the world has ""lower regard"" for the United States now under Obama than under President George W. Bush. We rated that claim False. So what about Obama's claim? The president is putting words into pollsters’ mouths when he specifically says strength and respect, but he’s generally right that world opinion of the United States has improved. Here’s a breakdown of how the United States stacked up over the course of Obama’s presidency, according to various polls. Positive opinions are expressed with a plus sign, and negative ones with a minus. The number outside of the parentheses indicates the net favorability. 2008 2014/2015 Change Gallup 0 (+34/-34) +15 (+45/-20) +15 Pew -5 (+43/-48) +45 (+69/-24) +50 BBC World Service/Globescan -8 (+35/-47) +4 (+42/-38) +12 We’ll go through the available data one by one Gallup Polling data from Gallup supports Obama’s claim. In its 2015 survey of more than 130 countries, 45 percent approved of the job performance of the leadership of the United States, while 28 percent disapproved. That’s up 11 percent in favorability while down 6 percent unfavorability from 2008. Here’s a snapshot:  Pew Research Center In Pew’s June 2008 survey of 23 countries, 43 percent of respondents had a favorable view of the United States while 48 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view on average. In 2015 survey of 39 countries, the United States’ favorability jumped up to 69 percent while  unfavorability dropped down to 24 percent. Out of the 21 countries included in both surveys, 18 had a more positive view of the United States in 2015 than they did in 2007. Russia, Lebanon and Jordan on the other hand had a more negative view. BBC World Service/Globescan Views toward the United States improved the least out of the three sets of polling, but they did improve. In 2008, an average of 35 percent of people surveyed in 34 countries said the United States is ""having a positive influence"" while 47 percent said it had a negative influence. Six years later, the global average jumped up to 42 percent positive and 38 percent negative. (Seven out of 10 people in 18 countries also told the BBC that Obama’s election was a good choice in a 2016 poll. Just three out of 10 people said that about President George W. Bush in 2005.) Our ruling Obama said, ""Almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago when I took office."" The general sentiment that the United States is viewed more positively around the world is supported by three different sets of polls, but they don’t specifically talk about strength or respect.

Crime and illegal immigration are at decades-long lows, says Barack Obama
","In his keynote speech on the third night of the Democratic convention, President Barack Obama devoted time to attacking Republican nominee Donald Trump, saying that the candidate promising to ""Make America Great Again"" is living in a country that is already great. ""Ronald Reagan called America 'a shining city on a hill,' "" Obama said. ""Donald Trump calls it 'a divided crime scene' that only he can fix. It doesn’t matter to him that illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they’ve been in decades, because he’s not offering any real solutions to those issues. He’s just offering slogans, and he’s offering fear. He’s betting that if he scares enough people, he might score just enough votes to win this election."" Trump did, in fact, call the United States ""a divided crime scene"" in a tweet. But for this fact-check, we're going to focus on Obama's claim about illegal immigration and crime. Immigration rates There is no reliable count of illegal immigration. Obviously, people coming into the United States illegally are trying to avoid detection. The best indicator available is the number of people apprehended by the U.S. Border Patrol, an imperfect metric because some people can be double-counted if they are apprehended twice, for example. Those data show a mostly steady decline to 337,117 apprehensions in the 2015 fiscal year. In contrast, apprehensions peaked in 2000, when more than 1.6 million were logged. To see a lower nationwide apprehension rate you would have to go back 44 years, to 1971. (The vast majority of those apprehensions in 2015 — 98 percent — were along the southwest border.) Another important caveat to note is that rates don't necessarily equate to enforcement, which has gotten stricter in recent years. Also, the number of people attempting to cross is tied to economic conditions, which aren't always under control of a president. Crime rates Contrary to what Trump has repeatedly contended, the crime rate in the United States has been on the decline for years. There's been some preliminary data from early 2015 and partial comparisons as late as early 2016 indicating an uptick, but the overall trend through 2014 from annual data compiled by the FBI — using reports submitted by local law enforcement agencies — show that violent crime has been falling steadily since the early 1990s.  The trend for property crime is similar. In addition, annual statistics collected by the Justice Department for the National Crime Victimization Survey shows the same trends. Our ruling Obama said, ""Illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they’ve been in decades."" The data generally support his claim, but the numbers aren't perfect. There's a hint of a recent uptick in crime based on partial and preliminary data from 2015 and 2016, and estimates of illegal immigration have to rely on border patrol apprehensions because it's impossible to directly count the number of people sneaking into the United States. With those words of caution in mind, we rate Obama's claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7b8d1f60-5715-4cd5-9bf2-999919183a31",/factchecks/2016/jul/28/barack-obama/crime-and-illegal-immigration-are-decades-long-low/

Biden: Almost right on U.S. workers as the most productive
","On the third night of the Democratic convention, Vice President Joe Biden took vigorous exception to the Republican message of a nation teetering on the brink. ""Not only do we have the largest economy in the world, we have the strongest economy in the world,"" Biden said. ""We have the most productive workers in the world. And given a fair shot, given a fair chance, Americans have never ever ever let their country down."" Does American have the most productive workers? Not quite. We checked the numbers and found that we rank third, not first. Productivity is a measure of how much value comes out of each hour worked. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development tracks the performance of the world’s higher income nations. When the OECD compares the GDP per hour worked across 47 countries (using dollars corrected for inflation and the purchasing power in each nation), it consistently reports that Luxembourg and Norway have more productive workers than the United States.

For each hour worked in Luxembourg, that country gains $79.30. In Norway, the amount is $78.90. In the United States, the value is $62.40. We reached out to Biden’s press office and were told that when he’s made this comparison before, he has referred to other larger economies, which means the United States ranks first. He left out that qualification this time. Our ruling Biden said that America has the most productive workers in the world. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development tracks how much value comes out of each hour worked in the world’s higher income nations. According to its data, Luxembourg and Norway have more productive workers than America. That ranking has been in place since 2010. Third is not first.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Tim Kaine']","
At DNC, Tim Kaine says even Republicans think Donald Trump's proposals are problematic
","It’s not just Democrats who think America would suffer under a Donald Trump presidency, said Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine. Take it from ""John McCain’s chief economic adviser during the ’08 race who estimated that Trump’s promises would cause America to lose 3.5 million jobs,"" said Kaine, a senator from Virginia, in a speech on the third night of the Democratic National Convention. Kaine was referring to a blistering analysis of Trump’s economic proposals published by respected financial firm Moody’s Analytics. When the report first came out in June, Hillary Clinton also jumped on the fact that an adviser to a former Republican presidential candidate had produced such a critical report. But Trump responded to say: Not so fast. Mark Zandi, Moody’s chief economist and the report’s lead author, actually supports Clinton and President Barack Obama. So who is this guy? Zandi is a well-respected economist, and politicians and economists on both sides of the aisle like him. His latest report, which is sharply critical of Trump’s policy proposals, is a methodical examination that looks at three possible scenarios: one where Trump’s proposals are adopted in full, one where they are adopted on a smaller scale, and one that envisions a compromise with Congress. (Moody’s says a similar report about Clinton’s proposals is forthcoming.) Assuming that Trump’s proposals are adopted in full, the analysts do, in fact, estimate that the economy will be ""significantly weaker,"" and there will be a 3.5 million drop in jobs, as Kaine said. ""Under the scenario in which all his stated policies become law in the manner proposed, the economy suffers a lengthy recession and is smaller at the end of his four-year term than when he took office,"" the report says. ""By the end of his presidency, there are close to 3.5 million fewer jobs, and the unemployment rate rises to as high as 7 percent, compared with below 5 percent today. During Mr. Trump’s presidency, the average American household’s after-inflation income will stagnate, and stock prices and real house values will decline."" Though others might take issue with some aspects of his findings, the purpose of this fact-check is not to cast doubt on the quality of Zandi’s Trump report or his work generally. We have quoted him as an expert source on the economy in previous stories. Rather, Kaine is using Zandi’s Republican credentials as a former McCain adviser to make the point that even Republicans think Trump’s proposals would be bad for the economy. But it turns out he is leaving out an important piece of information that leaves a giant hole in that particular line of argument — notably that Zandi has donated the maximum amount of $2,700 to Clinton’s primary campaign. Beyond this presidential cycle, Zandi has donated to a variety of Democrats going back to 2007. Zandi confirmed to PolitiFact that he is a registered Democrat. In the 2008 presidential race, though, he did support Republican candidate Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. He donated more than $2,000 to McCain’s campaign, and he was one of several economists advising McCain in an official capacity. But Zandi definitely wasn’t McCain’s chief adviser, as Kaine said, and has called his role in the campaign ""very modest."" Zandi was a Democrat back then, too, but he told the Wall Street Journal he is ""eclectic"" and that he has done work for members of both parties, a point he has since reiterated. After the 2008 election, though, Zandi turned out to be an important asset to the Obama administration. Zandi told us he wasn’t an official adviser to Obama or the White House, but he has produced research concluding the Obama administration’s response to the 2008 financial crisis was a success. And he was on Obama’s short list to regulate the Federal Housing Finance Agency, though he didn’t get the job. We asked Zandi what he would tell people who question whether his report on Trump is neutral, given his sizeable donation to Clinton and past connections with Democrats. ""We used the same model of the economy we use for all our studies,"" he said. ""And the study is completely transparent. Moreover, the approach we took is the same approach the (nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office) takes when evaluating similar fiscal policy proposals. I'm very interested in hearing substantive critiques of our work."" Our ruling Kaine said ""John McCain’s chief economic adviser during the ’08 race … estimated that Trump’s promises would cause america to lose 3.5 million jobs."" The Moody’s report concluded that Trump’s economic proposals, if adopted in full, could cost 3.5 million jobs. And Zandi was a donor and economic adviser to the McCain campaign. But he was not the chief adviser, and this isn’t the full picture of his political affiliations. As it turns out, Zandi is a registered Democrat and donated the maximum amount to Clinton’s primary campaign. Zandi is a well-respected economist, and we are not in this fact-check casting doubt on the credibility of his Trump report or his work generally. He has advised and worked on issues for politicians on both sides of the aisle for many years. But to identify Zandi only as a former adviser of McCain leaves out a lot of the story about Zandi’s political affiliations.

"['National', 'Debt', 'Taxes', 'Tim Kaine']","
Tim Kaine says Donald Trump's plan would add $30 trillion in debt, tilt toward the wealthy
","Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., criticized Donald Trump’s fiscal proposals during his debut convention speech as the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Independent analysts, Kaine said, ""found Trump's tax plan, given to the wealthy and big corporations, would rack up $30 trillion in debt."" We’ll take a look at this statement in two parts. Trump ‘would rack up $30 trillion in debt’ As we have previously reported, this figure originated in an analysis from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that, among other things, regularly analyzes the broader economic effects of presidential candidates’ tax proposals. In its report, the center found that ""including interest costs, the proposal would add $11.2 trillion to the national debt by 2026 and $34.1 trillion by 2036."" This estimate assumes no major spending cuts would be made, which tracks with the historical pattern, the authors said. The Clinton campaign also noted that Trump has not specified any cuts to offset his plan. So Kaine has a point that the $30 trillion-plus figure has been used by an independent organization. Still, it’s worth noting a couple caveats. • That analysis uses a 20-year time frame. When groups like the Tax Policy Center analyze the budgetary impact of policy proposals, they typically use a fixed ""window"" of time to measure the effects. Usually, it’s a 10-year window. In this case, the center offered both a 10-year window and a somewhat more unconventional 20-year window. Over 10 years, the center projected, Trump’s policies would increase the debt by $11.2 trillion. Over 20 years, they would increase the debt by $34.1 trillion. So Kaine, like Clinton before him, cherry-picked the biggest number for his talking point — a figure that was three times as big, and which used an unconventional window of time. • Kaine overlooked a study with a smaller projected debt increase. Another study of Trump’s policies, by the economic forecasting firm Moody’s, offered three scenarios, depending on whether one takes Trump’s policy proposals at face value, whether he enacts them with some compromises, or whether he ends up unable to enact much of his agenda. All the scenarios look at the impact of the resulting policies over 10 years. The first scenario produces additional debt of $9.7 trillion above current policies. The second produces a debt increase of $6.9 trillion above current policies. And the last produces a debt increase of less than $1 trillion above current policies. That final scenario is about 3 percent of the amount Kaine cited in the speech. ‘Given to the wealthy and big corporations’ The benefits of Trump’s plan skew toward the top of the income heap, independent experts have concluded. As we have noted, Trump’s proposal would consolidate the existing seven income brackets (with rates from 10 to 39.6 percent) into three with rates at 10, 20 and 25 percent. He would also increase the standard deduction from $6,300 to $25,000 for single filers and from $12,600 to $50,000 for joint filers and phase out most itemized deductions, except for charitable giving and mortgage interest. And he would eliminate the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax, the Affordable Care Act taxes, and the marriage penalty. Meanwhile, Trump’s reforms to the corporate tax code would collapse the eight tax brackets ranging from 15 to 35 percent into a flat rate of 15 percent and to tax the foreign income of U.S. companies abroad. While virtually everyone would pay less under the Trump plan, it offers particularly big benefits to the richest taxpayers. The Tax Policy Center calculated that the average tax cuts for the top 1 percent would be $275,000, or 17.5 percent of after-tax income, and for the top 0.1 percent, they would be $1.3 million, or nearly 19 percent of after-tax income. Middle-income households, meanwhile, would get a cut of $2,700, or a 4.9 percent reduction. Those making the least would see a cut, too, but only of $128 or so, working out to roughly 1 percent of after-tax income. Our ruling Kaine said that independent analysts ""found Trump's tax plan, given to the wealthy and big corporations, would rack up $30 trillion in debt."" Kaine is on pretty solid ground with the substance of his assertion, but he’s cherry-picked the biggest figure of several that were available.

Bloomberg says Trump bashes immigrants yet hires overseas workers
","Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg portrayed Donald Trump as a hypocrite on immigration in a speech at the Democratic National Convention. While Trump wants to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, he also uses the system to his advantage to hire foreigners, Bloomberg said in his endorsement of Hillary Clinton July 27, 2016. Trump ""games the U.S. visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages,"" Bloomberg said. While the accusation that Trump ""games the system"" is tough language, the real estate tycoon has hired temporary foreign workers to fill typically low-wage jobs at his properties. We will explain how he did it. H-2B visas We couldn’t reach a spokesman for Bloomberg, however, it’s likely he was referring to Trump hiring foreign workers at his Mar-A-Lago Club, an exclusive eating club in a mansion in Palm Beach County, Florida. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz made a similar attack during the primary. The club has sought H-2B visas for low-skilled, low-wage workers such as cooks, wait staff and housekeepers. H-2B visas are legal — Congress has set the cap at 66,000 per year — and its agricultural counterpart is the H-2A visa. The vast majority of the workers on these two visas programs nationwide are young Mexican men, although news reports say Trump sought workers from Europe. Employers argue they need these temporary workers to fill jobs Americans don’t want, while critics say the workers can be exploited. Since the visas are tied to a particular job, the foreigners can’t simply jump ship for a better paying job at another resort. The worker is paid based on the prevailing wage or minimum wage. Since 2010, nearly 300 U.S. residents applied or were referred for jobs at Mar-A-Lago, but only 17 were hired, the New York Times reported in February. Meanwhile, Mar-A-Lago sought more than 500 visas for foreign workers. (The visas were also sought at some of his other properties.) We don’t know how many people actually used the visas and became employees. To obtain the visas, businesses must prove they were unsuccessful at filling positions with Americans or legal residents. According to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, the resort posted jobs through CareerSource Florida, the local workforce development boards throughout the state. A U.S. Labor Department spokesman told PolitiFact Florida previously that 93 people applied for 250 seasonal job openings at the resort. Four were hired, while 79 didn’t answer interview requests or turned down jobs (10 applications were classified with unknown status). Documents the resort later filed with the Labor Department showed that many of the American applicants weren’t hired because they didn’t meet requirements. Some applicants didn’t want to work split shifts, lacked experience, wanted full-time jobs instead of part time, or didn’t respond when the resort contacted them. After that process, the Labor Department certified 685 H-2B visas for the Mar-A-Lago Club between 2008 and 2015. The New York Times asked Trump why he hired so many foreign workers when Americans applied for the same positions. ""The only reason they wouldn’t get a callback is that they weren’t qualified, for some reason,"" Trump replied. ""There are very few qualified people during the high season in the area."" But some experts question Trump’s assessment that it’s hard to find local help. In 2015, CareerSource assisted in placing nearly 1,800 candidates in hospitality jobs in Palm Beach County. But Mar-A-Lago didn’t show much interest in using the free service. Tom Veenstra, senior director of support services at CareerSource in Palm Beach County, told PolitiFact Florida that the first time his office received a request for helping finding workers was September 2015. (That was shortly after one of the first news reports, by Reuters, about Trump’s foreign hiring practices.) Since that time, Mar-A-Lago used the office to hire just one person, a banquet server. ""We called the HR director after the hire, and she said they were pleased with the hire and the candidates we sent them,"" Veenstra said. ""There has been nothing else since then."" So is Trump gaming the system? Gabriel ""Jack"" Chin, a professor at University of California Davis School of Law, said many of these companies say they can’t find American workers but only put in minimal effort. ""One answer is ‘yes, this is gaming the system, but everybody does it,’ in the sense that the labor certification standards are widely thought to be evaded in the way that Mar-A-Lago has done in the past,"" Chin said. Trump spokesman Stephen Miller referred us to Trump’s reply during the March 10 debate in Miami when he defended the use of these visas. ""I'm a businessman,"" Trump said. ""These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We're allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries -- the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete. So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me."" Miller said that Trump has opposed legislation to expand the visa program and pledged to reform visa programs to protect American workers.   Our ruling Bloomberg says Trump ""games the U.S. visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages."" Trump sought visas for hundreds of foreign workers to fill temporary positions at his Mar-A-Lago Club in Florida in recent years. Hundreds of U.S. applicants either applied or were referred for the jobs, but only a handful were hired. There is some debate about whether those applicants were qualified or not. Trump has used a legal program to obtain workers with H-2B visas. Saying he ""games"" the system is harsh language, and an expert says the process used by Trump is common.
