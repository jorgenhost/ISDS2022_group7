Billionaire Koch brothers gave $8 million to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker recall campaign, Dem chair says
","
As Wisconsin’s historic recall election approached, Democrats lamented the record-setting amount of money raised by Republican Gov. Scott Walker.

The complaints continued at the state party’s annual convention on June 8, 2012, three days after Walker defeated Democrat Tom Barrett in the recall.

The keynote speaker, Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, attacked billionaire brothers and conservative activists David and Charles Koch.

""Democrats were up against nothing short of an avalanche of secret, out-of-state and corporate special interest money amounting to a massive $31 million war chest for Governor Walker compared to just $4 million on our side,"" the south Florida congresswoman charged.

""In fact, the Koch brothers alone gave twice as much money to Scott Walker as the total amount of money raised by Tom Barrett.""

Roughly speaking, the total figures Wasserman Schultz cited have been widely reported: Walker raised $30.5 million and Barrett, the Milwaukee mayor, $3.94 million. That’s as of reports filed by May 21, 2012, more than two weeks before the election; final reports won't be filed until July 5, 2012.

If the congresswoman is correct, David and Charles Koch gave Walker’s campaign $8 million -- more than one-quarter of the governor's total haul.

It’s possible, given that Wisconsin law allowed unlimited contributions to Walker during part of the recall campaign.

But is Wasserman Schultz on the money?

The Koch brothers

Before they became front-page news in Wisconsin in early 2011, many residents had never heard of the Koch brothers.

Charles Koch, of Wichita, Kan., is chief executive officer of Wichita-based Koch Industries, which owns companies involved in oil and other industries. David Koch, of New York City, is the company’s executive vice president. The brothers, both in their 70s, are each worth $25 billion, making them tied for 12th on Forbes’ March 2012 list of billionaires.

In February 2011, a Buffalo, N.Y., blogger posing as David Koch made a prank call to Walker. Walker discussed ways Koch could help Republican legislators, presumably with TV and radio ads. He also said he considered -- but rejected -- planting troublemakers amid demonstrators who had been protesting his policies at the Wisconsin Capitol for a week.

We asked Koch companies spokeswoman Melissa Cohlmia to respond to Wasserman Schultz's claim. She said neither brother personally contributed any money to Walker.

Indeed, neither brother shows up as a donor to Walker’s campaign in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel searchable database of recall contributors.

Case closed?

Let’s dig a little deeper.

Wasserman Schultz's evidence

To back up Wasserman Schultz’s statement, Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Ellen Canale cited parts of a June 2012 CBS News article on contributions benefiting Walker that were linked to the brothers. She cited two figures in the article that add up to a total of $10 million, well above Wasserman Schultz’s claim of $8 million.

CBS indicated it got at least some of its data from the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks money in politics, but it didn’t attribute specific figures to the Madison-based nonprofit or to any other source.

The article said $3 million was spent on Walker’s behalf by the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, which was founded by the Koch brothers. How or when the money was spent isn’t stated.

The article also said Americans for Prosperity spent $7 million in 2011 to promote Walker's agenda, ""launching an ad campaign just two days after the governor introduced legislation ending collective bargaining for public unions.""

So, Wasserman Schultz is backing down from her original claim -- that the Koch brothers gave Walker $8 million -- and is now saying the money came from the group the brothers founded.

Canale also provided a second article, from Florida’s Palm Beach Post in February 2012, in which David Koch said of Walker:

""We're helping him, as we should. We've gotten pretty good at this over the years. We've spent a lot of money in Wisconsin. We're going to spend more.""

In saying ""we,"" Koch was referring to Americans for Prosperity, the article said.

So, clearly there’s a close connection between the Koch brothers and the group they created.

Examining the evidence

Two questions arise:

1. Are the $3 million and $7 million figures Wasserman Schultz cites in the CBS article accurate?

In examining campaign money in the gubernatorial recall campaign, we reported in late May 2012 that the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign estimated that Americans for Prosperity had spent $2.7 million on Walker’s behalf.  The group said it based its estimate primarily on AFP television advertising.

We followed up with executive director Mike McCabe about a week after the recall election. He said it's safe to say that Americans for Prosperity in late 2011 and early 2012 spent at least $3 million on Walker's behalf, but that it would be difficult to say how much more.

McCabe said he sees no evidence the total would be $10 million, as the CBS article indicated.

2. Is it fair to say those amounts were spent by the brothers when the money, as Wasserman Schultz now admits, came from Americans for Prosperity?

David Koch himself refers to Americans for Prosperity as ""we."" But as a tax-exempt ""social welfare"" organization, AFP does not have to disclose its donors, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit in Washington, D.C. that tracks money in politics on the national level.

So, the sources of Americans for Prosperity’s money, including how much has been contributed by the Koch brothers, aren't readily available -- although the center noted in a March 2012 report that AFP's donations included $1.6 million from the John William Pope Foundation in North Carolina and $520,000 from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee.

That makes it clear the group gets money from more than just the Kochs.

For its part, Americans for Prosperity says on its website that more than 90,000 Americans in all 50 states have given money to AFP or its sister organization, AFP Foundation.

AFP Wisconsin director Luke Hilgemann reiterated to us that AFP doesn't disclose its donors and he noted that the group's ads supported the 2011 state budget reforms, as opposed to a particular candidate or party.

The reforms are among Walker's signature accomplishments, although they needed approval from the Republican-controlled Legislature.

Our rating

Wasserman Schultz said ""the Koch brothers alone gave twice as much money to Scott Walker as the total amount of money raised by Tom Barrett,"" which would amount to about $8 million. She later said she meant it was through the conservative organization they founded, Americans for Prosperity, although that qualifier certainly was not part of her original statement.

The Koch brothers didn’t personally give any money to Walker’s campaign. There is no proof of how much Americans for Prosperity, which gets money from the Kochs but also other sources, spent on Walker's behalf. And the leading campaign money tracker in Wisconsin estimates the AFP total as being in the $3 million range.

We rate Wasserman Schultz's claim False. 
Update: After this item was published, Brendan Fischer of the Center for Media and Democracy pointed out that a June 2012 CNN article said Americans for Prosperity had spent $10 million. We contacted AFP president Tim Phillips, who told us AFP had spent $10 million in 2011 and 2012 on TV ads, direct mail, staff and other expenses to support reforms made by Walker and the Legislature. We also contacted the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which reiterated that it saw evidence of only about $3 million in AFP spending, but that it could not be sure because AFP is not required to report its spending. The original claim cited money directly from the Koch Brothers, not AFP which has numerous other donors. As such, we don't feel a change in rating is warranted.",/factchecks/2012/jun/20/debbie-wasserman-schultz/billionaire-koch-brothers-gave-8-million-wisconsin/
"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Rob Portman']","
Rob Portman says there has been a substantial increase in federal government jobs under Obama
","
How’s the economy doing?

Judging from President Barack Obama’s recent gaffe (the private sector ""is doing fine"") and public reaction, the answer might depend upon which sector employs you. The White House quickly said that the president was simply trying to say that state and local governments need help to stem job losses.

But U.S. Sen. Rob Portman saw it differently. Portman, an Ohio Republican, told a conference call with reporters on June 14 that Obama’s point was that ""the reason the economy is weak is because we are losing too many government jobs.""

Whether Portman accurately interpreted Obama’s point or not, he quickly moved to knock it down.  

""Well first of all,"" Portman said, ""we are not losing government jobs. If you look at the overall net jobs in the federal government, we’ve actually seen an increase in federal government jobs, and pretty substantially. There have been some reductions in state and local jobs, I don’t know what the net number is, but I would just make the point that I made earlier: If you are looking to grow the economy, the way to grow the economy is not to grow more public-sector jobs.""

His claim that the federal government has added jobs, published on Cleveland.com, The Plain Dealer’s online arm, caught the attention of a skeptical reader. PolitiFact Ohio agreed it was worth examining.

Has the federal government substantially increased its hiring?

Portman did not specify a period for this purported increase, but his comments were about the weak economic recovery and what he says was Obama’s inadequate approach dating to the stimulus. So we’ll use the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, passed in February 2009, as the baseline.

The federal government had nearly 2.8 million employees when the stimulus passed. (The exact number, important here, is 2.795 million.) Then, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics:
  
The number has dropped slowly every single month since March 2011.

You can assess this a couple of ways. The trend for more than a year has been downward, while the net number since the stimulus passed in early 2009 is up -- by 24,000.

Yet Portman’s point was clear: that the proper way to grow the economy is through private sector jobs, not public sector jobs. He didn’t say federal jobs have inched upward. He said they have grown ""pretty substantially.""

How big is substantial?

Federal employment on net has grown by less than 1 percent since the stimulus passed, BLS data and our calculator show.

His characterization of state and local government employment is correct. State employment fell from 5.188 million workers when the stimulus passed to 5.073 million in May, or by 115,000 jobs.

At the local government level, cities, towns, townships and counties dropped overall employment from 14.594 million when the stimulus passed to 14.077 million in May, a loss of 517,000 jobs.

The losses came as local and state governments cut their payrolls in response to lower tax collections -- itself a result of the weak economy.

As for federal employment, the subject of Portman’s claim, it  shows a net growth in the three-plus years since the stimulus passed, but that growth is modest at best, and it is now trending downward month after month. Characterizing a net increase of less than 1 percent as substantial is inaccurate.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Portman’s claim rates False.

T-SPLOST supporter says options are slim if referendum fails
","
Next month’s monumental voter referendum to increase the sales tax rate to pay for dozens of transportation projects across metro Atlanta has brought up an interesting question.

Can we do this over and come up with another list of projects if the referendum fails?

PolitiFact Georgia wondered what was the answer after attending a town hall meeting last weekend where there was some disagreement about whether we could hit the reset button.

""There is no Plan B,"" referendum supporter Terry Lawler said at the meeting organized by the Fulton County Taxpayers Foundation.

Lawler, a former state lawmaker, was the lone panelist in support of the referendum. His main point: If there is another referendum, the project list wouldn’t change much. Lawler is executive director of the Regional Business Coalition of Metropolitan Atlanta, a group that consists of some of the largest chambers of commerce in the region.

As Lawler spoke, a man handed out fliers with the Georgia Green Party logo that contradicted Lawler’s statement. The flier had a list of top 10 ""lies"" about the referendum. No. 2 on the list was ""If T-SPLOST doesn’t pass, ‘there is no Plan B.’ ""

On July 31, voters in 10 Atlanta-area counties will decide whether they want to increase the sales tax rate in their respective counties by a penny-per-dollar to fund 157 transportation projects that planners hope will ease congestion in the region. Projects include improvements at the busy interchange at I-285 and Ga. 400 in Dunwoody, a new rail line from the Lindbergh area to Emory University and the return of local bus service in Clayton County. If approved, the tax would last 10 years. It is projected to collect as much as $8.5 billion when adjusted for inflation.

Georgia Sierra Club Director Colleen Kiernan, who was at the meeting, said the plan needs more mass transit options. John Evans, president of the NAACP’s DeKalb County chapter, was also at the meeting. He asked why taxpayers there should pay more in sales taxes, particularly since the plan doesn’t include a proposal to extend MARTA service to the area near the Mall at Stonecrest.

The plan’s supporters say it required great effort to persuade the Georgia Legislature to put a referendum on the ballot, and if voters reject it, there may never be this kind of opportunity to create such a large funding source for transportation in the region.

Nonsense, some say.

""The corrupt pols and their contributors who came up with their take-it-or-leave-it plan say it’s Atlanta’s last and only chance to invest in transit. … It ain’t so,"" the Green Party flier read. ""The law says we can come up with a new and better list and vote again in two years.""

PolitiFact Georgia read the state House of Representatives bill that was passed in 2010 to allow the referendum. In the last one-third of House Bill 277, there is a sentence that confirms that point.

""If more than one-half of the votes cast throughout the entire special district are in favor of levying the tax, then the tax shall be levied as provided in this article; otherwise the tax shall not be levied and the question of levying the tax shall not again be submitted to the voters of the special district until after 24 months immediately following the month in which the election was held.""

Lawler said the bill does allow residents to vote on the matter two years afterward if the referendum fails, but he said there is some context to his claim. First, he said state leaders have said if the referendum fails, it is unlikely that they will try this again. Gov. Nathan Deal has said residents may not have another chance to fix so many transportation issues at once if they turn it down, according to media reports. House Speaker David Ralston has said it is unlikely that the Legislature would be willing to spend political capital to bring it up again.

""If it fails, then I think it is going to be difficult to have the General Assembly go back and redo something that’s failed. I don’t think there’s going to be any point in trying to dress up a crashed car,"" Ralston said, according to a media report.

Lawler’s other argument is that the list may not change much if lawmakers and planners went in reverse and tried to create a new list. For example, he said, every project on Fayette County’s list is geared toward road improvements while the bulk of money to be spent on projects in DeKalb County is for mass transit.

""With a Plan B, you are implying that there is going to be something different,"" he said. ""I don’t see a dramatic difference. There is no Plan B.""

We wondered whether some of these road projects in Fayette could change in a revised plan or could DeKalb decide to change course on the Clifton rail project and spend it on extending the MARTA line to Stonecrest? Lawler said DeKalb could make some changes, but it would be more difficult for smaller counties to change some projects because of the long list of criteria required for inclusion on the project list.

""In Fayette, there were 13 projects to choose from. They chose 10 of the 13, again leaving only three potential substitutes,"" Lawler said. ""In Rockdale [County], there were five eligible projects and Rockdale leaders chose three, leaving two potential substitutes.""

The Atlanta Regional Commission, which offered technical guidance to lawmakers who shaped the list of 157 projects, wrote a ""what if"" scenario in case the referendum fails and regional leaders want to try again. The ARC projects it would be four years before another referendum could be held.

ARC Director Doug Hooker told us that the project list could change in that time if new officials are elected in various counties with different transportation priorities. Hooker also noted the distaste of lawmakers for another referendum.

""What I’m told is a lot of officials don’t have an appetite to do it over again,"" Hooker said.

To sum up, there is a possibility lawmakers could decide not to try another referendum, which could mean there may not be a Plan B.

But the legislative bill that created the referendum does offer the option of another referendum if this one fails July 31. The projects on a new list could change. It’s unknown at this point by how much.

There is a written document that says lawmakers can try again if the July 31 referendum fails. That is a critical factor that must be considered to fully examine Lawler’s statement.

American Crossroads says Tim Kaine urged $500 billion in Medicare cuts
","
American Crossroads GPS, a conservative advocacy group, has a new TV ad attacking Democratic Senate candidate Tim Kaine that airs an old, discredited charge.

The 30-second commercial says Kaine ""left Virginia behind"" during the final full year of his governorship in 2009 when, at President Barack Obama’s request, he became chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

With footage of a suitcase being zipped and a passenger jet in the sky, the announcer says, ""Kaine put partisan ambitions first, selling policies he knows hurt Virginia: Medicare spending cuts...""

A silhouette appears of a person in a wheelchair. White and yellow capital letters letters read: ""TIM KAINE $500 BILLION IN MEDICARE CUTS.""

Did Kaine, as DNC chairman, really promote $500 billion in Medicare reductions?

PolitiFact is familiar with the $500 billion claim because it has come up over the last two years as a Republican talking point in a number of competitive races across the country.  It all relates to Medicare reforms that were included in the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Medicare covers health insurance costs for 39 million seniors and 8 million people under 65 receiving Social Security who are disabled. It makes up about 12 percent of the federal budget.

During the last decade, the federal cost of Medicare increased by an average 8.1 percent a year. One of the goals of health care reform is to slow that growth.

We asked American Crossroads -- a political action committee affiliated with Karl Rove, the senior political adviser to former President George W. Bush -- for evidence that Medicare has been cut by $500 billion. It referred us to three items written during the week Congress approved the health care law in March 2010. Two of them were news stories saying the legislation would ""cut"" the program by that amount.

The third piece was a Congressional Budget Office estimate of the costs and savings in the healthcare bill. The nonpartisan agency said the law would reduce the projected 10-year cost of Medicare by $455 billion. But it did not say savings would come from ""cuts"" in services.
Instead, the CBO explained that ""Medicare spending would increase significantly more slowly during the next two decades than it has increased during the past two decades.""

The estimate became the basis for a tutorial by The Kaiser Family Foundation on how the health care reforms affect Medicare. The presentation was conducted by Tricia Neuman, a Kaiser vice president and director of the non-profit’s Medicare Policy Project.

Some changes in the law increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage, Neuman said. For instance, the health care law adds $5 billion to help cover prevention services and $43 billion to help fill in a gap -- or ""doughnut hole"" --  for buying prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program.

Other changes will slow the growth in Medicare spending by more than $500 billion over 10 years, according to Kaiser’s tutorial. The largest savings, about $219 billion, will come from reducing the increases in reimbursements that medical providers receive each year.

Another $136 billion will come from reductions in beneficiary payments for those enrolled in optional, private Medicare Advantage plans. Also, premiums will become more expensive for affluent Medicare beneficiaries. Those with high-cost ""Cadillac"" health insurance plans will begin paying a 40 percent excise tax on their premiums in 2018.

The CBO, in a new estimate in March 2011, said the health care law would reduce the projected cost of Medicare by $564 billion from 2012 through 2021.

But again, here’s the key fact: the health care law, according to Kaiser, does not cut $500 billion from current Medicare spending. Rather, the law will slow the program's future growth.

Medicare spending will still increase. The CBO projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.

Most people, according to Kaiser, will not see their Medicare benefits reduced.

Now, let’s turn back to Kaine.

As DNC chairman, Kaine was a steadfast supporter of Obama’s policies, including the health care law. When the legislation passed the U.S. Senate, Kaine said, ""We are now on the verge of the biggest domestic policy breakthrough since the Civil Rights Acts of the 1960s.""

Our ruling

American Crossroads says Kaine promoted a $500 billion cut to Medicare.

The Affordable Care Act contains about $564 billion in cost-savings measures for Medicare over 10 years. But the definition of a cut means there would be a reduction in spending. That’s not the case here. Medicare spending will continue to expand. The law will slow the projected rate of growth.

Kaine did advocate for the health care reform legislation, but he never called for a $500 billion cut to Medicare.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Facebook posts']","
Facebook post says Michigan lawmaker silenced for saying ‘vagina’
","
Yes, this did happen. The rumors you’ve heard about a female lawmaker in Michigan saying ""vagina"" and causing an uproar are not made up.

On June 13, 2012, the second-to-last day of the spring legislative session in Michigan, state lawmakers took up a bill regulating abortion providers. The proposed law would require expensive medical malpractice insurance for abortion providers, dictate how to dispose of aborted fetuses and require doctors to screen women to determine if they're being coerced to terminate their pregnancy.

None of that sat well with Democratic Rep. Lisa Brown, who stood up in opposition during debate in the Republican-controlled House. Brown invoked her Jewish religion for her own personal support of abortion rights and asked that lawmakers not impose their religious beliefs on others.

But it was Brown’s closing line that sparked a political wildfire: ""Finally Mr. Speaker, I’m flattered that you’re all so interested in my vagina, but ‘no’ means ‘no.’ ""

That remark got Brown banned from speaking in the House, where she was deemed to have violated the chamber’s decorum. And that only made the story get bigger. Cue the Twitter hashtags. Call the cable news hosts. Take the fight to Facebook.

Here’s a post we spotted: On a black background in white letters, the banner reads ""Vagina,"" in huge letters. It goes on, ""Because apparently, saying that word in the Michigan State House of Representatives can get you a two-day ban from speaking on the floor. So pass it on.""

We won’t pass it on, but we will check it out.

The bill, the debate

As we noted, the legislation strengthens restrictions on abortion providers. It passed the Michigan House largely along party lines and next heads to the state Senate.

Here are Brown’s complete comments shortly before the vote:

""This legislation does a lot of things, Mr. Speaker. It regulates business, requiring exorbitant insurance policies to be purchased, which will result in clinics closing doors, causing people to lose their jobs and denying women their constitutional rights.

""Yesterday we heard from the representative from Holland (Mich.) speak about religious freedom. I’m Jewish. I keep kosher in my home. I have two sets of dishes, one for meat and one for dairy, and another two sets of dishes on top of that for Passover. Judaism believes that therapeutic abortions, namely abortions performed in order to preserve the life of the mother, are not only permissible but mandatory. The stage of pregnancy does not matter. Wherever there is a question of the life of the mother or that of the unborn child, Jewish law rules in favor of preserving the life of the mother. The status of the fetus as human life does not equal that of the mother.

""I have not asked you to adopt and adhere to my religious beliefs. Why are you asking me to adopt yours? And finally Mr. Speaker, I’m flattered that you’re all so interested in my vagina but ‘no’ means ‘no.’ ""

In video of her floor speech, a person can be heard hooting in the background along with some light applause. Then there’s a loud slap of the gavel, and a man’s voice says ""Members, I do ask that you respect the decorum of the House.""

The ban

The next day, Brown learned she was prohibited from speaking during floor debate.

Her office didn’t return our call seeking comment, but in an interview on MSNBC’s The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell, Brown said she had been informed of the prohibition by her party’s leadership and had yet to hear from any Republicans about the decision.

""I never heard from them that I was banned, why or for how long,"" she said. ""We’re on break now for about a month for the summer and we’ll see what happens when we come back. I would love to hear from somebody. I’ve read things in the paper but not one person has contacted me.""

Ari Adler, spokesman for House Speaker Jase Bolger, said in an interview that Republicans followed a process in imposing the ban.

He said the majority floor leader, Rep. Jim Stamas, saw Brown’s name on the Democrats’ list of members who intended to speak about bills on the day’s agenda. Stamas informed the Democrats’ leader that Brown would not be recognized.

""He believed he was doing the right thing and being professional in how he handled it,"" Adler said.

Along with Brown, a second Democratic legislator was not allowed to speak that day. Rep. Barbara Byrum had tried to introduce an amendment to the abortion bill that would restrict vasectomies unless men could prove medical emergency. Adler said Byrum had not been recognized to speak and began yelling while others were speaking.

""Our Republican leadership, both male and female, felt that they did not maintain the decorum of the House,"" Adler said of Brown and Byrum.

The reason

Why was Brown banned from speaking? The answer depends on whom you ask.

Brown called a press conference with Byrum the day of the ban and said she could only guess the reason.

""Perhaps they are silencing me because I dared to speak out yesterday on religious oppression,"" she said in the press conference. ""Or maybe they’re banning me because I dared say ‘vagina,’ the correct medical name of a part of a woman’s anatomy these lawmakers are trying to regulate. Isn’t that something? These lawmakers, predominantly men, have no problem passing legislation about my vagina, but I dare mention its name and they become outraged. You know what? I’m outraged.""

As the controversy swelled, Brown announced plans to perform, along with other lawmakers and actresses, Eve Ensler’s 1996 play The Vagina Monologues on the steps of the state capitol.

Ensler appeared alongside her in the MSNBC interview. Said Brown: ""I didn’t say anything wrong. It’s the anatomically correct terminology for female anatomy. I was speaking to a bill that was about abortion, so it was germane to the legislation that we were debating. …As I said, I don’t think I did anything wrong. I don’t know what terminology somebody would prefer, but I think ‘vagina’ is the right word to use.""

O’Donnell responded, ""Now Rep. Brown, if using that one word on the floor of the House gets you banned from speaking on the floor, what do you think performing ‘The Vagina Monologues’ on the steps of the capitol is going to get you?""

Brown: ""Well there’s a little thing called free speech.""

O’Donnell: ""I don’t know about that in Michigan. That’s in doubt right now, isn’t it?""

Brown: ""A little bit, yes it is.""

Other news coverage, like O’Donnell’s comments, have assumed that Brown was banned for saying ""vagina.""

But Michigan House Republicans say that’s not the case.

""It had nothing to do with her use of the word ‘vagina.’ That’s not at all accurate,"" Adler, the House speaker’s spokesman said. ""It was the reference that she made when she said ‘no means no.’ Members immediately connected that support of the legislation was akin to supporting rape.""

""No means no"" has commonly been used as a slogan in anti-date rape campaigns.

The Detroit News reported that Republican Rep. Mike Callton called Brown’s comments ""offensive.""

""It was so offensive, I don't even want to say it in front of women. I would not say that in mixed company,"" Callton told the Detroit News.

Adler said, ""That was his personal opinion. That’s not leadership’s opinion.""

To Democrats, however, Republicans are ""changing their tune.""

Katie Carey, press secretary for the House Democratic caucus, said the first reason for the ban given by Republicans was Brown’s use of ""vagina,"" as evidenced by Callton’s remark. Then they said Brown violated House decorum. Then came the ""no means no"" explanation.

""I think they’re just trying to use whatever excuse they can come up with and whatever fits,"" Carey said. ""I think that they didn’t expect it to be as big a story as it was.""

Bob Ballenger, the longtime editor of the political newsletter Inside Michigan Politics, said the reasoning that Brown’s use of ""no means no"" equated to approval of rape didn’t make sense to him.

""Nobody on God’s green earth knows what the hell he’s talking about,"" Ballenger said, adding that he and a few other reporters had discussed Adler’s explanation. ""It makes no sense at all. The preceding sentence before she said ‘no means no’ was ‘I’m glad you’re so interested in my vagina.’""

""I think there are several things going on,"" he said. ""First of all, Lisa Brown and Barbara Byrum are both very outspoken women. They have gotten in the faces of the Republican majority before. They are not popular with the Republican leadership.""

So what does he think is the likely reason for the speaking ban?

""I just think in general her whole diatribe and the fact that they just don’t like her,"" Ballenger said.

But more important than the reason for the ban, stated or unstated, is simply that it happened. Ballenger said Republicans have pointed out to him that when Democrats controlled the House, they too restricted how much the opposing party got to say.

""Whatever the issue, it’s dead wrong,"" Ballenger said. ""You cannot do this in a legislative body. You cannot silence speech. ... Where would you draw the line?""

Our ruling

The Facebook post -- surely one of many -- snarkily summed up the Michigan controversy: ""Vagina. Because apparently, saying that word in the Michigan State House of Representatives can get you a two-day ban from speaking on the floor. So pass it on,"" the post said.

Republicans who silenced Brown say the reason wasn't the word itself, but that she violated decorum and invoked an offensive parallel to rape. Brown herself said she thinks it was just because she said ""vagina."" Her party spokeswoman said the reason has evolved as Republicans try to dodge negative media coverage. And a longtime observer of Michigan politics says the Republicans in power simply don’t like Brown and her outspoken opposition. 
The Facebook post hedges its claim, saying that the word ""apparently"" can get a person banned. That seems like a fair claim:  A lawmaker who said ""vagina"" in a floor debate was then banned from speaking, though for one day, not two. Overall, we rate the Facebook claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/jun/19/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-michigan-lawmaker-silenced-sayi/

Facebook post says more than 43 percent of all food stamps are given to illegal immigrants
","
A reader recently sent us a Facebook post with ""10 Illegal Alien Facts."" One of them was that ""more than 43 percent of all food stamps are given to illegals."" 
We decided to take a look -- and quickly found the claim was preposterous. 
In March 2012, the most recent month for which figures are available, a total of 46.4 million people received food stamps, so 43 percent of that number would be slightly less than 20 million. 
For obvious reasons, the numbers of illegal immigrants is much trickier to track. However, the most widely accepted number comes from the Pew Hispanic Center, which estimated that there were 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the United States in 2010. 
So it’s mathematically impossible for more than 43 percent of all food stamps to be given to illegals -- there simply aren’t enough undocumented immigrants in the country to make the math work. Nor does the math work if you choose a month before the number of food stamp recipients rose due to the recession. In October 2008, there were 30.8 million recipients; 43 percent of that number is 13.2 million, which exceeded the total number of illegal immigrants at the time, 11.6 million. 
None of this even takes into account an even more basic reality: It is against the law for Illegal immigrants to receive food stamps and the government has a process to verify immigration status. Citizen children of illegal immigrants can qualify (there are 3.5 million, according to Pew) but that's not enough to make the math work. 
Is it possible some illegal immigrants receive food stamps anyway? Sure. But even if every single one somehow managed to fool the government, it still wouldn't be enough to account for the 43 percent. 
Our rating 
The first of the Facebook post’s 10 claims -- that ""more than 43 percent of all food stamps are given to illegals"" -- is ridiculously false. It isn’t mathematically possible given the number of illegal immigrants in the United States, and it ignores the fact that illegal immigrants can’t even receive food stamps legally.

Chris Christie targeted by Democrats over New Jersey ranking 47th for economic performance in 2011
","
Gov. Chris Christie has been touting New Jersey’s economic success in appearances across the country, but back at home, Democrats recently jumped on a statistic to prove the Republican governor wrong.

Between tweets, news releases and a YouTube video, Democrats have countered Christie’s ""Jersey Comeback"" theme with the claim that, under his watch, the Garden State ranked 47th in the nation for economic performance in 2011.

""In 2011, NJ economy ranked 47th--at the bottom with Alabama, Mississippi & Wyoming. Under Christie, NJ is falling behind,"" Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald (D-Camden) wrote June 6 in one of a few related tweets.

On June 11, the New Jersey Democratic State Committee released a YouTube video that includes that statistic as a way of showing similarities between Christie and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.

For this fact-check, PolitiFact New Jersey is examining two issues -- whether that 47th ranking is correct and how much Christie can be held responsible for it. 
Here’s what we found: the statistic is on target, but blaming Christie ignores other factors behind the lackluster economic activity.

Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, argued that the ""burden of proof here is on Governor Christie"" for touting and taking credit for the ""Jersey Comeback.""

""The governor is laying claim to economic growth that doesn't exist,"" Hester said in an e-mail. ""When legitimate figures show New Jersey ranking 47th in real GDP growth, then the governor needs to be held accountable for his own claims.""

First, let’s discuss that 47th place finish.

On June 5, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis released data on real gross domestic product in 2011 and preceding years for each state and Washington, D.C. Real GDP is an inflation-adjusted measure of a state’s economy. 
Between 2010 and 2011, real GDP in New Jersey declined by 0.5 percent, leaving that change in 47th place among the 50 states, according to the bureau. Only six other states saw a drop in real GDP, including Alabama, Mississippi and Wyoming, the bureau said.

Still, it’s worth noting that, according to the bureau, real GDP in New Jersey increased by 1.5 percent between 2009 and 2010. That means during 2010 and 2011 -- the first two years of Christie’s tenure -- there was a net increase of 1 percent.

Now, we’ll address whether it’s fair to blame Christie for the state’s economic performance in 2011.

After reaching out to a few experts, it appears that the Democrats’ criticism is overblown. A governor can impact economic growth in a state, but there are several other factors at play, some experts said.

James Alm, chair of the Department of Economics at Tulane University in New Orleans, La., told us ""states (and state governors), while not powerless by any means to affect state growth, are also largely at the mercy of broader national trends, and even state trends that are outside their own control/influence.""

Phillip Swagel, professor in International Economic Policy at the University of Maryland, School of Public Policy, noted how New Jersey is considerably affected by the economic fortunes of Philadelphia and New York City.

""Governor Christie likely has limited control over this, let alone over national economic trends,"" Swagel said in an e-mail. ""This is not to say that the Governor’s policies would have no impact on the state economic situation, but just that there are many factors.""

Bruce Yandle, an adjunct economics professor at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia, added in an e-mail: ""It takes a miracle worker as governor to enter office and somehow magically cause the workforce and employment to expand immediately, and cause productivity to rise.""

Our ruling

In a series of tweets, Greenwald blamed Christie for New Jersey ranking 47th in the nation for economic performance in 2011.

With a 0.5 percent decline in real GDP in New Jersey, that ranking is accurate. As for Christie’s role, experts told us a governor can impact a state’s economic growth, but there are various other factors, including national and regional conditions.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

Do most states allow employers to discriminate against gays and lesbians?
","
U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., issued a press release recently, in support of legislation to end employment discrimination against workers who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.  S.811, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2011, would also protect people who express their gender identity at work.  

""Less than half of all states have legal protections on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, despite the fact that LGBT Americans report employment discrimination and unemployment at much higher rates than the U.S. average,"" the release said.

PolitiFact Oregon was confused. Wasn’t such employer behavior already prohibited under federal civil rights law? Isn’t it the same as how employers aren’t allowed to hire, promote, pay or fire based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin?

Apparently not. Jamal Raad, Merkley’s spokesman, pointed us to a map by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force that shows Oregon as one of 16 states and Washington, D.C., that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or the expression of gender identification. Five additional states prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, but not on expression. So Merkley is correct about the figures.

Raad also clued us into other reports and studies to back up the statement.

The Center for American Progress has a state-by-state report that goes even further, identifying 10 additional states with policies prohibiting such behavior in state government or in a part of state government. Those are generally done by executive policy. These policies do not carry the weight of law and do not extend beyond public employees. The federal government also prohibits discrimination against gays and lesbians, as do many Fortune 500 companies.

Now the next question: Do gay, lesbian and bisexual workers report employment discrimination at much higher rates than the U.S. average? This was much harder to track down.

Raad directed us to a 2005 Gallup Poll, which showed that 15 percent of employed people reported being discriminated against in the previous 12 months. Gallup researchers concluded the actual rate was probably between 9 percent and 15 percent.

Among racial/ethnic groups, whites reported the lowest incidence of discrimination, at 12 percent and Asians reported the highest incidence, at 31 percent. But there was no breakout by sexual orientation, leaving us without an apples-to-apples comparison. (Of the types of discrimination, sexual orientation made up for 4 percent of cases, same as religion. Gender accounted for 26 percent of cases.)

We turned to Jennifer Pizer, legal director of the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, whose researchers submitted testimony in support of legislation. Pizer said she did not know of a broader study comparing discrimination rates.

But her institute relies on several statistics, including a 2008 survey showing that a quarter of lesbian, gay and bisexual respondents reported experiencing job discrimination in the previous five years. A 2007 report of past surveys found that anywhere between 16 percent and 68 percent of LGBT reported experiencing employment discrimination. Again, that’s a fairly broad range and it doesn’t indicate an average of all employees.

Perhaps most helpful to us was, Pizer’s colleagues also aggregated state data and found that lesbian, gay and bisexual workers filed anti-discrimination complaints at about the same rate as women, about 5 complaints per every 10,000 employees. Complaints based on race and ethnicity were higher, at 7 per 10,000 workers.

Just out of curiosity, we checked with Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian’s office. Spokesman Bob Estabrook said discrimination based on sexual orientation makes up about 2 percent of job and housing complaints. California’s fair employment and housing department shows a similar percentage. But this doesn’t tell us much about rates of job discrimination in general.

Where does this leave us?

We couldn’t find definitive data showing that gay, lesbian and transgender workers ""report employment discrimination and unemployment at much higher rates than the U.S. average."" We suspect attitudes toward all minority groups are changing and also, as the workplace becomes more diversified, we expect the U.S. discrimination average to change. We don’t know whether the LGBT community faces more discrimination at work than ethnic groups, women, older people or the disabled.

That aside, the studies cited -- and quite frankly, common sense -- suggest that the gay and lesbian population sees its share of discrimination at the workplace. And transgender workers, most likely, see more than their fair share of unemployment and discrimination. And they are not protected under the federal Civil Rights Act.

Merkley is correct to say that in more than half the states in the country, there is no law against employers who discriminate based on sexual orientation although employers and government agencies may have their own prohibitions.

The statement requires clarification on the scope of protections offered in private and public sector employment. It also requires clarification about what we do know and do not know about job discrimination faced by the general population and other groups. We rate the statement Mostly True.

Rick Perry says Obama has provided guns to Mexican drug cartels
","
Addressing the Republican Party of Texas convention, Gov. Rick Perry said the country erred in 2008 by electing the wrong person as president.

""Three and a half years, and nearly 100 rounds of golf into his presidency, Barack Obama has exploded the federal debt, passed a failed, budget-busting stimulus package, socialized health care, and provided guns to Mexican drug cartels,"" Perry said June 7, 2012. ""Admit it, America -- 2008 was our national ‘oops’  moment!""

We recently confirmed Obama had played nearly 100 rounds of golf as president. And PolitiFact reporters have previously explored claims about the debt, the success of the stimulus package and whether the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act amounts to socialized health care.

Perry’s claim that Obama ""provided guns to Mexican drug cartels"" struck us as novel. Is it correct?

Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email that Perry was referring to the botched federal gun trafficking investigation on the U.S.-Mexico border known as Fast and Furious in which federal agents lost track of hundreds of firearms they were letting flow into Mexico from Arizona as part of an effort to build cases against Mexican drug cartels.

The multi-agency federal arms-trafficking investigation took place from late 2009 to early 2011 -- during Obama’s presidency -- under the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, an agency of the Justice Department.

In the operation, agents purposely allowed weapons to be illegally purchased and circulated on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, as the Los Angeles Times said in a Dec. 8, 2011, news story. Two of the weapons turned up after a U.S. Border Patrol agent was killed in southern Arizona, the paper said, though for a January 2012 fact check, we found no information supporting a claim that ballistics tests confirmed that the found weapons killed the agent.

The Times said scores of other guns in the operation were reportedly used in violent crimes in Mexico, adding: ""While the aim of Fast and Furious was to track weapons, instead it ended up significantly arming the Mexican drug cartels.""

And did Obama have a hand in the endeavor? We looked for indications.

In a March 22, 2011, interview with Univision, posted online by CBS News, Obama said neither he nor Attorney General Eric Holder authorized Fast and Furious and pointed out that the operation was under internal investigation. ""We don’t have all the facts,"" Obama said.

Asked if he was informed about the operation, Obama replied: ""Absolutely not. This is a pretty big government, the United States government. I’ve got a lot of moving parts."" He added: ""Our policy is to ramp up the interdiction"" or capture ""of guns flowing south, because that’s contributing to some of the security problems that are taking place in Mexico.""

In an interview the same day with CNN Español and an October 2011 interview with ABC News, Obama said he learned of Fast and Furious from news reports. He further said to CNN: ""We have to make sure that we are interdicting the flow of guns and cash to the south. It's not enough just to interdict drugs flowing north. And so, we've actually initiated a whole range of measures to make sure that we're reducing that southbound flow.""

Noting that Holder had launched the internal investigation into Fast and Furious, Obama told ABC ""it is not acceptable for us to allow guns to go into Mexico... So it's very upsetting to me to think that somebody showed such bad judgment that they would allow something like that to happen and we will find out who and what happened in this situation and make sure it gets corrected.""

We looked for other signs of Obama’s role in the operation, finding nothing to contradict his accounts.

In 2011, staff to the House Committee on Oversight & Government Reform, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, issued two Fast and Furious reports. The June 14, 2011, report covers Fast and Furious accounts of ATF agents. The July 26, 2011, report explores the impact of Fast and Furious on Mexico. The reports do not gauge Obama’s involvement.

A January 2012 report by House Democrats says the strategy of permitting illegal guns to flow to cartels in Mexico in hopes of building cases against vital figures originated with federal law officers in Arizona in 2006, which was when George W. Bush was president.

""Unfortunately, this strategy failed to include sufficient operational controls to stop these dangerous weapons from getting into the hands of violent criminals, creating a danger to public safety on both sides of the border,"" Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, told colleagues in a Jan. 30, 2012, letter summarizing the report. His letter says Fast and Furious was the fourth federal operation since 2006 in which gun-walking occurred.

Finally, we reached the office of Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who has been critical of Fast and Furious. Grassley spokeswoman Jill Gerber provided a partially redacted document that appears to be a Jan. 8, 2010, briefing paper on Fast and Furious originated by federal authorities based in Arizona. Its bullet point No. 13 opens: ""Currently our strategy is to allow the transfer of firearms to continue to take place, albeit at a much slower pace, in order to further the investigation and allow for the identification of additional co-conspirators who would continue to operate and illegally traffic"" firearms to Mexican drug trafficking organizations ""perpetrating armed violence along the Southwest Border.""

Informed of Perry’s statement, Gerber said by email: ""It’s more accurate and complete to say the ‘Obama administration’ provided guns to Mexican drug cartels rather than"" to ""say President Obama himself did so.""

Our ruling

Fast and Furious, intended to send guns to Mexican drug cartels toward building cases against key figures, took place on Obama’s watch. However, unlike the other results bemoaned by Perry at the convention -- growth in the federal debt and the passage of Obamacare and the stimulus -- we see no indication Obama had an influential role in the border operation. That is, there is no sign that Obama either initiated or approved the deliberate flow of guns to cartels.

Barack Obama ad says Mitt Romney was No. 1 in state debt as Mass. governor
","
In the newest installment of a continuing attack on Mitt Romney’s record as governor of Massachusetts, an ad from the Obama campaign takes aim at the Bay State’s debt load. 
The ad, released June 12, 2012, has the ironic title ""Number One,"" claiming that ""when Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts ... (had) more debt per person than any other state in the country."" 
First, here's a primer on state debt and how it differs from the national debt. 
Because the United States is a sovereign nation that can print its own money, it is able to run annual operating deficits -- that is, an annual shortfall of revenues compared to outlays. The accumulation of all past deficits, minus past surpluses, produces the national debt. States, by contrast, can’t print their own money, so most of them -- including Massachusetts -- require a balanced budget. States can, however,  borrow money in order to fund capital improvements -- everything from new roads to new school buildings. That’s the debt we’re talking about here. 
We'll also note that despite its heavy debt burden, Massachusetts has remained highly creditworthy. Beginning in January 2000, Massachusetts’ credit rating according to Moody’s has been Aa2, the third-highest category, just behind Aaa and Aa1. In 2010, the ratings were recalibrated for all states, and while Massachusetts creditworthiness didn’t change, the name of its rating was changed to Aa1 -- the second-highest category for states. (Here’s the full list of ratings, down to C.) 
Looking at the numbers 
The ad attributes the statistic to a report by the credit-rating agency Moody’s. The report -- ""2007 State Debt Medians"" -- isn’t available online, but Moody’s gave us a copy. 
We found that the ad accurately portrays the report’s findings. A table of the states ranked by ""net tax-supported debt per capita"" shows Massachusetts in the number-one spot, at $4,153 per person. 
We should note that this is not the only way to measure debt. Tax-supported debt is defined as long-term indebtedness payable from tax revenues, with long-term typically meaning maturities at least 15 years after issuance. And then there is ""self-supporting debt,"" which is repaid from revenues generated by the enterprise itself. 
Annual state fiscal statistics compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau use a more expansive definition of debt than just the tax-supported kind, so we decided to look at this data set as well. As it turns out, in 2007, Massachusetts also ranked number-one in the nation with $10,612 in debt per capita. 
So the Obama campaign has some solid grounding for its claim. But the ad glosses over some important context. 
Massachusetts’ debt includes local projects 
Massachusetts’ statewide debt figure may be larger than other states because it issued debt for some projects that in other states might be covered by counties. In a May 21, 2012, report on Massachusetts, Moody’s specifically noted this factor, saying that ""debt levels have been driven upwards in part by the commonwealth's issuance of bonds to finance projects that in other states would be paid for at the local level."" 
The debt accumulated under Romney often didn’t come from policies he pursued 
Many of the infrastructure projects contributing to Massachusetts’ high debt per capita ranking were initiated under prior governors and legislatures. 
A good example of this is the ""Big Dig"" -- the massive, and often controversial, project to transform the highways and tunnels of downtown Boston. It was initially conceived in the 1970s, with construction beginning in 1991 and continuing into Romney’s term as governor. In 2008, the Boston Globe estimated that the project will end up costing $22 billion and will not be paid off until 2038.  It’s been called ""the largest, most complex, and most technically challenging highway project in American history."" 
The impact of the Big Dig on the state’s per capita debt totals was significant. According to a 2007 report from the Massachusetts state comptroller, the Big Dig is directly responsible for $4.2 billion in state debt and funding from sources other than the federal government or user fees. 
The Obama camp says it’s only fair for Romney to take responsibility for the debt on his watch since he challenged his Democratic opponent in a 2002 gubernatorial debate on the issue: ""You said, I will stand up and engage the governor, and the Legislature -- I will use my bond-writing capacity to assure that we do not increase the state debt per person. And yet you didn't follow that promise. You broke that promise. We now have the highest state debt per person of any state in the nation."" 
We think both attacks -- Romney’s in 2002 and Obama’s 2012 -- gloss over some important details. 
Massachusetts ranked high in debt per capita long before Romney became governor 
To compare Romney’s tenure to those of previous governors, we looked at the Census Bureau’s debt data every four years going back to 1995 to see where Massachusetts ranked nationally. Here’s what we found: 
1995 -- Gov. William Weld (R): Massachusetts ranked 6th, with $4,566 in debt per capita
1999 -- Gov. Paul Celluci (R): Massachusetts ranked 2nd, with $5,797 in debt per capita
2003 -- Govs. Jane Swift (R) / Mitt Romney (R): Massachusetts ranked 2nd, with $7,551 in debt per capita
2007 -- Govs. Romney / Deval Patrick (D): Massachusetts ranked 1st, with $10,612 in debt per capita 
Looking at the numbers this way provides fodder for both sides. Obama’s case is bolstered by the fact that debt rose at a faster pace on Romney’s watch than in the previous four-year periods: 
1995-1999: Up 27 percent
1999-2003: Up 30 percent
2003-2007: Up 41 percent 
However, the data shows that the Bay State ranked high on the national debt rankings well before Romney's inauguration. In 1999 (four years before Romney took office) and 2003 (the year he took office), Massachusetts ranked second in the nation in debt per capita 
""Massachusetts has had a high debt burden for decades, so governors are hamstrung to make any meaningful change in that picture in one or even two terms,"" said Michael J. Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent group that analyzes budget and tax issues in Massachusetts 
Our ruling 
The Obama campaign has accurately noted that Massachusetts had more debt per capita, by two different measurements, than any state in the country. However, this claim leaves out important context. 
Massachusetts ranked high long before Romney took office, in part because some of its debt supported projects that in other states would have been paid for by localities. Meanwhile, any suggestion that Romney’s stewardship on debt was harmful to the state is weakened by the state’s consistently high creditworthiness rating and the fact that Romney, by law, balanced the operating budget every year. Finally, much of the debt was actually initiated under the policies of prior governors and legislatures, and experts say that there was not much Romney could have done unilaterally to dramatically change the debt trajectory, particularly given a strong Democratic majority in the Legislature that regularly overrode his vetoes. The claim leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our definition of Half True.",/factchecks/2012/jun/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-mitt-romney-was-no-1-state-de/
"['Abortion', 'Immigration', 'National', 'Health Care', 'Facebook posts']","
Facebook post compares elements of Romneycare, Obamacare
","The health care debate has landed on the virtual battleground of Facebook, with comparisons being made between President Barack Obama’s 2010 law and the bill that Republican Mitt Romney signed in Massachusetts.

A reader asked us to check this graphic that claims ""Romneycare covers abortion, illegal immigrants and has a public option. Obamacare does not."" We’ve also seen that statement repeated on Twitter.

Obamacare, of course, is the familiar name for the Affordable Care Act passed by Congress in 2010 and signed by Obama. It seeks health coverage for every American by requiring most Americans to obtain coverage or face a fine. To help people meet that requirement, it expands Medicaid for the poor, provides subsidies for people of modest means to buy insurance, and sets up fines that have the effect of encouraging large employers to provide insurance for their employees. It also sets up insurance exchanges where individuals and businesses can purchase private insurance. Those elements are also the backbone of the health care reform Romney signed in Massachusetts in 2006. Architects of both plans acknowledge that the Massachusetts law served as the model for the national plan.

As for the specific comparisons between the two, we’ll take them one by one.

Romneycare vs. Obamacare on abortion

PolitiFact looked at the abortion issue when Romney’s Republican primary challengers accused him of enacting taxpayer-funded abortions in Massachusetts.

The state law itself does not specify what services are covered and what aren’t. Search the text of it, and ""abortion"" is nowhere to be found.
   
But because of a 1981 Supreme Judicial Court ruling in Massachusetts, the cost of abortions must be included in publicly subsidized plans. Most private insurance plans in the U.S. include abortion coverage, and the state-subsidized plans in Massachusetts do, too. That includes coverage for Massachusetts residents enrolled in Medicaid.

So it’s true that the plan makes abortion accessible through private insurance plans subsidized by the state. But that’s dictated by a court ruling that long predated Romney’s term as governor.

On the federal level, coverage of abortion is a bit more complicated.

Here’s how we’ve explained a similar claim: Since 1976, the federal government has been guided by the Hyde Amendment, a law that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in peril. Due to that amendment -- which must be renewed every year -- abortion services are not provided by Medicaid or in health care plans offered to federal employees and for active and retired military.

But the health care exchanges established by the law raised the question of whether private companies should be allowed to offer abortion coverage (as most already do) when operating through the exchanges. And what if the people buying policies are getting government subsidies to buy insurance?

What resulted was essentially a compromise. When the exchanges begin operating in 2014, some states will ban all abortion coverage entirely for any plan selling on that state’s exchange. Doing so is allowed by a state ""opt-out"" clause that is part of the health care law. Beyond that, every state must offer at least one plan on its exchange that doesn’t cover abortion. In addition, no private insurer will be forced to cover abortion.

Unless a state exercises the opt-out clause, insurers will be allowed to sell policies on the exchanges that include abortion coverage. To allow this, yet still abide by the Hyde Amendment, sponsors of the bill drafted a procedure to differentiate between dollars spent on abortion coverage and dollars spent for everything else. (Anti-abortion advocates have consistently argued that the approach doesn’t offer strong enough protections to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion.)

The complex funding mechanisms make the question of whether Obamacare covers abortion a little fuzzy. But clearly the law provides some access to the service.

Romneycare vs. Obamacare on illegal immigrants

Immigration is another complicated area for the two health care laws.

Before the Massachusetts law was enacted, the state had a program on the books called the Uncompensated Care Pool, which dates to the mid-1980s.

When Romney’s health law passed, the name changed but the eligibility didn’t, said Brian Rosman, research director for the Massachusetts nonprofit group Health Care for All. Now known as the Health Safety Net, it reimburses hospitals and health care centers that provide care for the poor and uninsured.

Who can get the care? We found the answer on the Health Safety Net website:

""Am I Eligible? The Health Safety Net (Free Care) is for uninsured or underinsured Massachusetts residents who do not have access to affordable health coverage. People of any income with large medical bills that they cannot pay are also eligible. Your citizenship or immigration status does not affect your eligibility.""

Said Rosman: ""People don’t enroll in the program. They don’t get cards. Their benefits are just through the reimbursement to the health provider.""

That differs from other benefits outlined in the Massachusetts law, which specifies that only people there legally can receive Medicaid benefits or government subsidies to buy health insurance.

The Health Safety Net has no such restriction, although any benefit to illegal immigrants is indirect, since the money reimburses health providers, not individuals.

""It’s a state-administered program that essentially shares the cost of financing the care for uninsured and underinsured residents of the state across the whole health care system,"" said Sarah Iselin, former commissioner of the state agency that administers the Health Safety Net.

She pointed out that the 2006 law expanded coverage for people who qualify for programs specifically off limits to illegal residents. The Health Safety Net only applies to people who have been determined to be ineligible for those programs.

Similar to the Massachusetts program, Obamacare could benefit illegal immigrants only in a very indirect way.

First, what it doesn’t do: The law does not make people who are in the country illegally eligible for health insurance through the exchanges -- in fact it specifically bars them; it doesn’t allow them to get tax credits for purchasing insurance,  and it doesn’t allow them to receive Medicaid benefits.

What it does do: The law provides grants to community health care centers for construction and expansion. The National Association of Community Health Centers noted in 2010 that such centers ""make up the largest national network of primary care providers. Most health center patients have low incomes, are uninsured or publicly insured, and are members of racial/ethnic minority groups.""

""The community health centers serve anybody who needs health care, and I’m sure that will include undocumented people,"" said Rosman.

The Facebook post said Obamacare doesn’t ""cover"" illegal immigrants. It’s correct there are no coverage benefits for which undocumented people could be eligible, such as Medicaid or tax credits. The law did provide $11 billion over the first five years for community health centers, which treat people regardless of immigration status. That expands access to care at places where poor, undocumented people would have gone for care prior to the law, but it’s not the same as coverage.

Romneycare vs. Obamacare on a public option

This part isn’t complicated at all: Neither plan has a public option.

In Massachusetts a public option would be a program in which the state is the insurer, and Massachusetts has no such plan. The state oversees the health care exchange, but the plans offered there are all private. The reform law expanded Medicaid in Massachusetts, but that’s a program only for people who cannot afford to purchase insurance.

We checked with Rosman on this too.

""There’s nothing even close to (a public option),"" he said, adding that it was never considered in the debate about the law.

Early versions of the national health bill included a public option, with the idea that a government plan might be cheaper than private plans, making insurance available to the very poor. But the public option had many opponents in Congress and did not make it into the final law.

All together now

The Facebook post boils down complicated pieces of legislation to a few simple points. But its summary is short on accuracy. Here’s what we found:

Abortion: Romneycare enables people to purchase plans that include abortion coverage. Obamacare does as well, but it also lets states opt out and lets individuals buy plans that don’t cover the procedure.

Illegal immigrants: Romneycare’s Health Safety Net reimburses health providers who care for the poor, regardless of whether they’re in the country legally. Obamacare provides grants to community health centers, which also treat anyone who can’t afford to pay for health care. Neither law provides any form of insurance coverage to undocumented people.

Public option: Neither plan has a public option in which the government acts as the insurer.

The Facebook post got a few things right but most things wrong, particularly about Romney’s plan. Overall we rate it Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2012/jun/18/facebook-posts/facebook-post-compares-elements-romneycare-obamaca/

During his campaign for governor, Deal signed a pledge created by the anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform saying that he ""will oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes.""

Two years later, the fiscal conservative is backing a tax referendum that would raise $7.2 billion for road and transit projects, and as much as $8.5 billion after inflation, to build transportation projects across metro Atlanta.

Full Flop, we ruled. Days after our story was published, Deal denied that he violated the pledge.

The pledge ""relates to new taxes that were going to be initiated by legislative action,"" Deal told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider blog Wednesday.

This argument drew our attention. One of the reasons we gave Deal a Full Flop was that Grover Norquist, the head of Americans for Tax Reform, said for our June 8 article that ""it does violate the pledge.""

""It’s a rather significant tax increase,"" Norquist said.

Who’s right? Did the pledge Deal signed cover only ""new taxes that were going to be initiated by legislative action?""

Sounds like a job for the Truth-O-Meter.

Deal, the leader of state government, has been open about his support for the proposed 10-year, 1 percent sales tax -- also know as the T-SPLOST -- that would fund 157 transportation projects across the Atlanta region. Voters decide on the measure July 31.

The governor says the projects are needed to ease traffic congestion in metro Atlanta and will help attract and keep businesses throughout the state. Deal has spoken at a Buckhead fundraiser for the referendum and voiced his support to several large audiences in recent months, such as at the Atlanta Press Club, the Greater North Fulton Chamber of Commerce and at an event in Savannah.

The Washington-based Americans for Tax Reform believes any new legislation or changes to an existing tax structure that results in a new tax increase on individuals is a violation of the pledge by lawmakers who have signed it.

Thanks to the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, ATR has become a major player in Republican Party politics. More than half the members of the U.S. House of Representatives have signed the federal version of the pledge, and nearly half the U.S. Senate has joined them.

But the pledge is strict, and even self-avowed fiscal conservatives are starting to break ranks.

Just last week, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said lawmakers should be able to use money the federal government saves by eliminating tax loopholes to pay down the national debt.

""We’re so far in debt that if you don’t give up some ideological ground, the country sinks,"" Graham said in an ABC-Yahoo interview.  

On the state level, there’s transportation tax supporter Amos Amerson, a Republican who is leaving the House of Representatives after 12 years. He decided the pledge isn’t always practical and asked in a 2002 letter to be removed from ATR’s list. Amerson said he never received a response.

There are two versions of the pledge: one for federal politicians and another for the state level.

The federal pledge asks signers to oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal tax rate on individuals and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions or tax credits ""unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing taxes.""

The state version is brief. Politicians fill in the blanks of a single-sentence pledge:

""I ____ pledge to the taxpayers of the state of ____ that I will oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes.""

It makes no mention of taxes that are initiated by legislative action. Or anything else, for that matter.  

Deal signed the state version May 10, 2010, during his campaign for governor.

Our Flip-O-Meter ruling quoted Deal spokesman Brian Robinson, who said it was unfair to say the governor flip-flopped on his commitment to oppose tax increases.

But Deal earned a Full Flop just the same. The T-SPLOST is an increase in the sales tax. There are no cuts to make it revenue-neutral.

Now, back to our Truth-O-Meter check.

After our story ran, the AJC’s Political Insider blog reported Deal said he has an out because the pledge ""relates to new taxes that were going to be initiated by legislative action.""

How does he fare?

The governor’s office declined to comment for this fact-check, so we used some of Deal’s comments to reporters Wednesday to allow him to explain himself.

""I am advocating for it because this is not a legislatively imposed tax,"" he said. ""It is a tax increase that the people themselves will decide about. And for those who say otherwise, it seems to me that they would take away the right of the people to express their opinions of this importance.""

ATR’s state government affairs manager, Joshua Culling, told us that Deal is wrong about his interpretation of what he signed.

""The governor’s pledge is to ‘oppose and veto’ all taxes,"" Culling said. ""By vocally supporting T-SPLOST, he certainly isn’t holding up the first half of his commitment.""

ATR knows the meaning of the pledge better than anyone. It says Deal is wrong about his interpretation. We agree. Our rating: False.",/factchecks/2012/jun/18/nathan-deal/deals-defense-tax-pledge-fails-truth-test/

 George Allen says he froze college tuition when he was governor
","
U.S. Senate candidate George Allen says he put the brakes on rising college costs when he was governor from 1994 to 1998.

""Before I was governor, tuition was skyrocketing, and we stopped that,"" Allen said in a May 25 debate between four candidates seeking the GOP Senate nomination. ""We capped, and then we froze college tuition.""

Allen won the Republican primary on June 12 and will face Democrat Tim Kaine this fall. They are seeking to replace Democrat Jim Webb, who is not seeking a second Senate term.

We wondered if the Allen administration really did put a lid on tuition. Allen, while making this claim, shared credit with the Democratic-controlled legislature that served with him.

Dan Allen, a senior adviser to the campaign, pointed us to a July 2011 report from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia.

The study said that during the early 1990s, colleges and universities increased tuitions by double digits annually to compensate for state funding cuts made by the General Assembly and then-Gov. Doug Wilder to help balance the budget during a recession.

Wilder, in his final budget proposal made during an improving economy in December 1993, urged the General Assembly to cap tuition and instructional fee increases for in-state students at 5 percent during the 1994-95 school year and 4 percent during 1995-96.

Allen, who took office in January 1994, successfully urged the General Assembly go a step further and cap the increases at 3 percent during each of the next two school years.

In 1996, as SCHEV notes,  Allen and the General Assembly froze tuition and instructional fees entirely.  The action did not apply to a number of other mandatory college costs, such as fees for athletic programs, health services and campus transportation. Lawmakers eased some of the burden on colleges by appropriating an additional $200 million for higher education.

The Richmond Times-Dispatch in January 1998 reported that a strong economy during Allen’s term allowed him to finance the tuition freeze. State tax revenues grew by about 45 percent during his tenure.

Allen, in his farewell budget, recommended freezing tuition through 2000. His successor, Republican Jim Gilmore, rolled back tuition and instructional fees by 20 percent for in-state students.

When Allen arrived in the governor’s mansion during the 1993-94 academic year, the average tuition and instructional fees for full time, in-state undergraduate students at four-year colleges was $2,518, according to SCHEV’s historical tables.

That rose to $2,717 in the 1995-1996 academic year and stayed at that level through 1997-1998, the last academic year of Allen’s term.

Using inflation-adjusted figures based on 1992 dollars, the report shows the amount of tuition and instructional fees went  from $2,383 in the 1993-94  academic year down to $2,320 in 1997-98. Even when other mandatory fees that were not subject freeze are added in, the college costs remained flat after being adjusted for inflation.

Costs at two-year colleges showed the same trend: in-state tuition and instructional fees at those institutions were basically flat during Allen’s term.

Our ruling

Allen said that, as governor, he stopped soaring tuition costs by implementing a tuition freeze.

Allen and the General Assembly did impose a freeze after tuition had risen sharply during the early 1990s recession. Allen had leeway to cap tuitions because a healthy economy during his term allowed lawmakers to increase state appropriations to colleges and universities.

Joshua Stephany, the county’s medical examiner, announced on Jan. 10 that an autopsy had been completed but that the cause and manner of death were ""pending further studies and investigation which may take up to 10-12 weeks to complete.""   That hasn’t stopped some social media users from claiming without evidence that the star of ""Full House"" and ""America’s Funniest Home Videos"" died from a COVID-19 vaccine.  ""Another victim of the jab,"" one Twitter account said.  ""Bob Saget died from vaccine complications in his hotel room, on the first night of his fully vaccinated comedy tour,"" another claimed.  ""He just received his COVID booster a few weeks ago,"" a Facebook account added.

"['Medicaid', 'Texas', ""Beto O'Rourke""]","
Economic impact of Medicaid expansion may be more than $100 billion
","Announcing his candidacy for governor, former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke said Texas has left billions of dollars on the table by failing to expand Medicaid during Gov. Greg Abbott's tenure. ""Expanding Medicaid, which if we had done at the beginning of the Abbott administration, would have brought in $100 billion to this state's economy,"" O'Rourke said at a Nov. 19 rally in Houston. Texas is one of 12 states that hasn't expanded Medicaid coverage, which is backed mostly by federal funding. Using 2020 data, roughly 1.4 million uninsured adults would be eligible for health care coverage under Medicaid expansion in Texas — 34% of the state's uninsured nonelderly adult population, according to a February Kaiser Family Foundation fact sheet. There's no doubt Texas passed up a lot of money by not expanding Medicaid. But is O'Rourke's statement accurate that Texas passed up $100 billion? When we reached out to O'Rourke's campaign for evidence to support the claim, an official pointed us to a 2018 editorial from the Houston Chronicle that shared the opinion that turning down federal funding for Medicaid expansion puts the onus on counties to figure out how to serve uninsured people. The editorial board wrote, ""Under the plan passed as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2014, Texas would have received an estimated $100 billion over the course of a decade in exchange for increasing Medicaid eligibility to 138 percent of the poverty line."" In 2021, 138% of the federal poverty line works out to an income of $17,774 for an individual and $36,570 for a family of four. Texas lags behind the rest of the nation when it comes to health care coverage. According to 2019 Census Bureau health insurance coverage data released in 2020, nearly 1 in 5 Texans, or 18.4%, are uninsured. Adults without dependents or disabilities are not eligible for Medicaid regardless of income in Texas, and parents of dependent children are eligible up to about 14% of the federal poverty level, according to a 2020 Texas A&M study on Medicaid expansion for Episcopal Health Foundation, an advocate for Medicaid expansion. So, Texas has a coverage gap between Medicaid eligibility and eligibility for a federally subsidized Affordable Care Act Marketplace plan that begins at 100% of the federal poverty line. The $100 billion number in the editorial, as well as in other early news articles, appears to have originated from research conducted in 2013 by a consulting firm belonging to Billy Hamilton, former deputy comptroller of Texas. Commissioned by the Methodist Healthcare Ministries of South Texas, the report found that Texas legislators ""must decide whether to accept $100 billion in federal funding over 10 years to provide additional Medicaid health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for our state’s neediest citizens."" The consulting firm analyzed federal funding under scenarios of minimal enrollment, moderate enrollment, and high enrollment levels. The amount of federal dollars Medicaid expansion brings depends on enrollment and enrollee costs per month. Assuming moderate enrollment, the report looked at total federal spending from 2014 to 2017 and found that it would be nearly $23 billion for adults and $4.5 billion for children — a total of $27.5 billion for those four years. Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal matching rate declined from 100% of the cost to 95% in 2017 and to 90% of the expansion cost in 2020. In a footnote, the study cited a 2012 presentation made by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission before the Senate Health and Human Services and Senate State Affairs committees on the Affordable Care Act. Bee Moorhead, executive director of the interfaith legislative network Texas Impact, was a researcher on that study who had worked under Hamilton at the comptroller's office. She said in a phone interview that the presentation did estimate just over $100 billion in federal funding — and that it also included year-by-year estimates up to 2023. Moorhead said that the methodology used by the agency was the same as that used by Billy Hamilton Consulting. She described the agency's estimates as a realistic outlook on how much Texas could depend on the federal government for funding if it expanded Medicaid. Moorhead said, however, that more recent estimates on the amount of forgonefederal funding could be a lot less or more than what her study found. That's because other factors, like the state's population growth and poverty rates, could indicate greater possiblefederal funding. More recent estimates suggest Texas would receive federal funding between $5 billion and $6 billion annually if it expanded Medicaid. The state, meanwhile, would be responsible for 10 cents on every dollar, or $600 million to $700 million annually, according to an April 2021 article by the American-Statesman. Two such estimates: Though his office cited an editorial that focused on federal funding, O'Rourke most likely was referring to the larger economic effects of Medicaid expansion, which ""would have brought in $100 billion to this state's economy."" O'Rourke then said, ""[Medicaid expansion] would have further fueled the Texas Medical Center– the jobs that are being created right there, would have brought more doctors to more big cities and more rural communities alike."" He then mentioned the number of rural hospital closures. Medicaid expansion is expected to have a stimulus effect, or an economic ripple effect, that comes with an injection of money into the state economy, the Texas A&M analysis found. Predictions for that effect vary. Nationwide research shows state budgets were positively affected under Medicaid expansion, with a ""very small"" increase in spending by states relative to federal spending. A December 2020 report by the Perryman Group, and funded by Episcopal Health Foundation and Austin-based St. David's Foundation, looked at the economic effect. The Waco-based economic consulting group estimated the state could see gains of $244.7 billion over 10 fiscal years (2022 to 2031), as well as more than 2.1 million job-years of employment. Vivian Ho, at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy, also highlighted the multiplier effect, saying that the economic effect of federal funding was likely more than $100 billion. ""That happens with any type of dollars put into an economy. And so, here it makes sense you have that,"" Ho said. ""These are federal dollars that the state would not receive otherwise, so they boost the economy in general."" Economic effects also include less uncompensated care, increased profitability for health care providers, and improved financial security for low-income adults, according to a review of recent academic research by the Kaiser Family Foundation. A July 2020 insight article in the Journal of the American Medical Association highlighted job creation as a result of Medicaid expansion as an economic stimulus. So, if O'Rourke is talking about the potential economic effect of the federal funding, then the benefit is likely far more than $100 billion. O'Rourke said ""expanding Medicaid...would have brought in $100 billion to this state's economy"" if it had been done at the beginning of Abbott's tenure. Projections rely on making assumptions for the number of people who would register, the reimbursement rate and additional funding. The figure O'Rourke drew from was based on a 2013 estimate drawn up by the state government and verified by current and former state government financial experts. More recent research suggests the amount of forgonefederal funding could be less than the $10 billion per year on average that the $100 billion suggests. It could be $5 billion to $6 billion. But the ripple effect of even this smaller influx of federal money on the state's economy could be larger than $100 billion. The statement is accurate but needs additional context. We rate it Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2022/jan/10/beto-orourke/economic-impact-medicaid-expansion-may-be-more-100/

Virginia law restricting military-gear purchases didn’t affect I-95 recovery efforts
","Hundreds of motorists were left stranded in freezing temperatures on Interstate 95 in Virginia, some for more than 24 hours, after heavy snowfall led to multiple crashes and slowed emergency response.  The 40-mile traffic jam started building up the morning of Jan. 3 and wasn’t resolved until the following day. In a segment about the pileup, Dana Perino, a co-host on Fox News’ ""The Five,"" claimed that a move by Virginia Democrats complicated the recovery effort. ""I talked to a state legislator there in Virginia. He pointed out to me that, in the last several years, many on the left made the decision that local sheriffs should not be allowed to have military-grade equipment,"" Perino said. ""Because they said that was a bad symbol, and that it was too militaristic and authoritarian. But imagine if they were still allowed to have the equipment that they had just a few years ago it probably would've come in very helpful today."" The comment raised two questions: Did Virginia Democrats decide that local law enforcement shouldn’t get access to certain types of military equipment? And would the machinery have been helpful in recovery efforts on the snowy highway? The short answer is that Democrats did put such a law on the books, but it’s not what hampered the recovery effort.  For the details, let’s dig in. Fox News told us that Perino was referring to HB 5049, which prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from acquiring or buying certain pieces of military equipment unless they are granted a waiver by the state’s Criminal Justice Services Board. The list of equipment included weaponized unmanned aerial vehicles, combat aircraft, grenades, bayonets and armored mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles, or MRAPs.  The law includes a way for sheriffs to seek an exemption in specific circumstances. It also doesn’t bar them from participating in the Pentagon’s 1033 Program, which offers surplus military property to participating state and federal law enforcement agencies, said Patrick Mackin, a spokesperson for the Defense Logistics Agency, which manages the program. The legislation was introduced by Democratic Delegate Dan Helmer, a combat veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. It passed a Democratic-controlled Assembly along party lines, and was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam on Nov. 18, 2020.  Some of the resistance to the law focused on MRAPs and their potential use as rescue vehicles.  But Craig Fugate, a disaster management expert in extreme weather events and consultant in emergency management at Indian River State College, told PolitiFact that the conditions on I-95 didn’t require MRAP vehicles. ""Since there were no mines or ambush threats in the snow emergency, military transport vehicles, which are not prohibited, would better fit the mission of rescuing stranded motorists."" In any case, MRAPs can be purchased through the 1033 program, Mackin said, and Virginia’s law doesn’t prevent participating state-level law enforcement agencies from acquiring surplus military vehicles for road clearing, if they are available. State police and disaster management experts told PolitiFact that local sheriff’s agencies did not respond to stranded vehicles in the Jan. 3 traffic jam along Interstate 95, and that the types of equipment the law prohibits would not have been useful in clearing the snowy highway. ""Even before that legislation became law, the Virginia State Police had never purchased surplus military vehicles for use in interstate (highway) emergency response,"" agency spokesperson Corinne Geller wrote in an email.  Other than helping state police and Virginia’s Department of Transportation block off highway exits, local sheriff’s agencies did not assist in recovery efforts, Geller said.  The multi-agency recovery operation took around 30 hours.  Virginia State Police and transportation officials said deteriorating road conditions, multiple jack-knifed tractor trailer accidents and congestion from disabled vehicles significantly complicated cleanup efforts. In a phone call with reporters, Gov. Northam said that rainfall before the storm had washed away any chemicals or salt used to pretreat the roads. ""Then we had slushy snow that fell a lot faster than our snow plows could move it,"" WTOP News reported Northam as saying. ""And then, as night fell, the temperatures dropped below freezing. All those together created the perfect storm for what happened on I-95."" Northam and other Virginia state leaders defended the decision to not call on the National Guard, explaining that deployment would have taken too long and may not have helped. The Virginia Department of Transportation said it would investigate what might have gone wrong in the state’s response. Perino claimed that a law passed by Virginia Democrats prevented local sheriffs from having military equipment that ""would have come in very helpful"" with recovery efforts in the I-95 traffic jam. Virginia Democrats voted to pass such a law, but experts and state officials said that the prohibited equipment would not have helped clear roads any faster in the snowstorm, and that the law did not hamper recovery efforts. In any case, agencies can seek exemptions to the law for special circumstances, or may be able to take advantage of a federal program to acquire surplus military gear.

D’Souza falsely claims Jan. 6 video shows police using ‘massive’ force on ‘unarmed Trump supporters’
","Dinesh D’Souza falsely claimed that recently released footage of the Jan. 6 insurrection shows the police guarding the U.S. Capitol using ""massive amounts of force against unarmed Trump supporters"" — and he suggested that the government is sitting on more video that would show the same. The claim flew in the face of what other footage, court documents and testimony have shown about the rioters’ violence and use of real and makeshift weapons against police. D’Souza, a conservative commentator, made the claim on Fox News host Laura Ingraham’s show two days before the anniversary of the attack, which left about 140 police officers injured. ""If you follow Jan. 6 at the granular level with the facts that are coming out slowly, they are coming out because the government has been very reluctant to release footage, particularly footage of what happened in the tunnel on Jan. 6, where you now begin to see these cops using massive amounts of force against unarmed Trump supporters, including women,"" D’Souza said. ""The death of Rosanne Boyland is now being called into question,"" D’Souza continued. ""Was she the second Trump supporter that was killed by the authorities?"" Boyland, a 34-year-old Georgia woman who supported Trump and believed the QAnon conspiracy theory, was one of the four people who died as the crowd fought with police. The D.C. Medical Examiner’s Office said she died of accidental acute amphetamine intoxication, and videos compiled by the New York Times show her getting trampled in the crush of the mob as it surged against police lines near the Lower West Terrace tunnel. Prosecutors have said officers tried to reach Boyland to administer aid but were assaulted by other rioters. D’Souza’s Fox News appearance was not his first attempt at offering a counter-narrative surrounding the events of Jan. 6, 2021. In the year since the attack, he has claimed the event was ""a bunch of rowdy people walking through hallways,"" said it was a ""boisterous walk-through,"" and likened it to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s March on Washington in 1963. He has said repeatedly that the attack was not an insurrection or coup, and that the rioters charged for crimes are ""political prisoners."" PolitiFact named the lies about the Capitol attack and its significance the 2021 Lie of the Year. RELATED VIDEO  ""D’Souza’s quote falls squarely into a larger retelling of the history of Jan. 6 … as a peaceful protest by patriotic Americans that only turned violent because of the actions of police,"" said Michael Jensen, a senior researcher at the University of Maryland’s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. ""Countless hours of video captured by both the authorities and the rioters themselves clearly counter this reimagined take on Jan. 6."" The Capitol Police declined to comment on D’Souza’s claim, citing ongoing court cases.  But court documents from those cases show members of the crowd brandished real and makeshift weapons.  The rioters wielded bats, knives, crutches, flagpoles, skateboards, hockey sticks, zip ties, chemical sprays, and a fire extinguisher, the filings show. They stole and used police batons and riot shields. Several had guns on them or stashed nearby, according to court documents. As of Jan. 1, more than 225 people had been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding officers or employees, the Justice Department said, including over 75 charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer. In a series of emails to PolitiFact, D’Souza stood by his statement.  He told PolitiFact he was referring specifically to what happened in the tunnel at the Capitol’s Lower West Terrace and surrounding Boyland’s death.  ""If you read my quotation, it applies to the violence in the tunnel, and I specifically referenced Rosanne Boyland, who was unarmed,"" he said in one email. But zooming in on the tunnel doesn’t make D’Souza’s claim more accurate. There’s no evidence that the footage that has not yet been released would, either.  ""Claims that the mob that invaded the Capitol during the Jan. 6 insurrection, or specifically the mob that intended to breach the terrace tunnel, were ‘unarmed’ is an utter falsehood disproved by facts and statements from those on the scene,"" said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. The Justice Department in December released three hours of surveillance footage showing the scene from the tunnel at the Capitol’s Lower West Terrace. The footage shows outnumbered officers retreating into the tunnel before rioters piled in behind them and punched, kicked, climbed over and threw things at them in an effort to push through.  The brawl in the tunnel was where Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges got crushed against a door.   It was also where Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone was dragged into the crowd, stripped of his badge, beaten, tased and threatened with chants to ""kill him with his own gun."" Fanone later testified that he fell unconscious and suffered a heart attack.  ""It was like a war zone,"" Fanone told CNN in an interview aired on the anniversary of the attack. ""It was just littered with weapons, debris. CS gas, like residual gas just kind of floating in the air, created this like mist, or like a haze."" Metropolitan Police Commander Ramey Kyle said in the same interview that he felt ""some of the most violent people in that crowd"" were ""concentrated at these (tunnel) doors.""  According to court documents, those rioters included: Patrick McCaughey, who prosecutors say used a police shield to pin Hodges against the door. Daniel Rodriguez, who prosecutors say tased Fanone twice in the neck. Robert Morss, who prosecutors say directed rioters to form a ""shield wall"" and push past the police on the tunnel’s frontlines. Devlyn Thompson, who was sentenced to nearly four years in prison for helping throw a speaker at the officers and striking one with a baton. Robert Palmer, who was sentenced to more than five years in prison for using a wooden plank and a fire extinguisher to attack the officers. Timothy Desjardins, who prosecutors say assaulted police with a broken wooden table leg. Nicholas Languerand, who pleaded guilty to throwing an orange traffic barrier and two stick-like objects at the officers. Cody Mattice and James Mault, who prosecutors say sprayed chemical sprays at the officers. Mark Andrew Mazza, who prosecutors say swung a baton at the officers, and who allegedly brought a loaded gun onto Capitol grounds. Other rioters fought police at several other points on the Capitol grounds, videos show. ""These rioters were armed with blunt objects, stun guns, and chemical sprays and aggressively forced the Capitol Police into a precarious position inside the tunnel,"" Jensen said. ""The police remained restrained, using non-lethal force to stop the advances of the mob.""  Court documents show Jan. 6 rioters attacking police with real and makeshift weapons in the Lower West Terrace tunnel. In one email to PolitiFact, D’Souza cited a civil lawsuit filed by Victoria White, who claims the police repeatedly punched her and struck her with a metal baton. White faces several charges, including impeding or attempting to impede officers. Joseph McBride, White’s attorney, told PolitiFact the tunnel footage shows ""an absolutely brutal beating that she endured."" A video he posted to Rumble zeroes in on one officer in the tunnel who swung a baton over the front line of police as the standoff with the rioters continued. D’Souza also shared a Twitter thread that claimed to identify Boyland in the new footage and said other body camera footage appeared to show an officer hitting her ""still body"" with a baton. But Newsweek parsed through videos of the same moment in November, after other social media users circulated a misleading, doctored video and claimed it showed the police beating Boyland. Newsweek rated those claims false, reporting that the officer in question was actually attempting to hit back at a rioter who was wielding a hockey stick as a weapon.

"['New York', 'Tom Suozzi']","
Suozzi is calling Hochul an ‘interim Governor.’ That’s wrong.
","Tom Suozzi, a Long Island congressman who plans to run in the Democratic primary for governor, has been calling Gov. Kathy Hochul ""interim Governor.""  In a tweet on Jan. 4, Suozzi said: ""With crime surging across NYS, this morning I will call on the interim Governor to develop a comprehensive public safety plan to stem the violence.""  He also used the term in a statement on Dec. 23, saying that Hochul didn’t have a plan to fight the COVID surge.  Hochul was elected lieutenant governor in 2014 and 2018 after facing primary challengers both times. She became governor after Andrew Cuomo resigned amid scandal in August. Given Hochul’s path to the governorship, we wondered if there is any truth to Suozzi’s claim.  Four experts on the New York state constitution told us that there are no abbreviations or modifications on the powers and duties of lieutenant governors who become governor after their predecessors resign. The New York State Constitution recognizes her as governor, fully and completely.  Peter J. Galie, an emeritus professor of political science at Canisius College who has written extensively on the state constitution, says that when the governor resigns, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. ""Period. No acting, no interim,"" Galie said.   Article IV, Sect. 5, states: ""In case of the removal of the governor from office or of his or her death or resignation, the lieutenant-governor shall become governor for the remainder of the term.""  The same section says that in periods where the governor cannot perform the duties of the office, in cases such as impeachment, travel, or illness, the lieutenant governor will ""act as governor."" But there is no qualifier such as ""act as governor"" in the case of Hochul’s situation.   We reached out to Christopher Bopst, a partner at the Buffalo law firm Wilder & Linneball and co-author of books about the New York State Constitution.  Interim implies that there will be a special election for the governor’s office, but that is not the case when a lieutenant governor becomes governor in New York, Bopst said. Hochul is filling out the remainder of the term that Cuomo was elected to in 2018. Cuomo resigned in the third year of his term, but even in the case of a governor-elect who declined to or couldn't take office after an election but before the term began, the lieutenant governor would serve the full four-year term, he said.  Suozzi’s campaign told us that voters never elected Hochul governor.  ""The fact is that voters have not elected Kathy Hochul as their governor and no matter how you slice it, until New Yorkers have their say at the ballot box she is serving in an interim capacity,"" said Kim Devlin, senior advisor to Suozzi’s campaign.   The campaign also provided news articles where Hochul or David Paterson, another New York governor who ascended to higher office after the incumbent resigned, were described as ""interim.""   Suozzi has been calling Gov. Kathy Hochul ""interim governor.""  Suozzi’s team told us that Hochul is an interim governor because she was not elected as governor and is serving in an interim capacity until the next election.  Hochul is interim governor only to the extent that any other governor is ""interim"" - they all serve fixed terms and are subject to election, Bopst said.  While political campaigns employ colorful language to persuade voters and discount their rivals, using ""interim"" to describe Hochul’s governorship can be misleading. The New York State Constitution does not make any modifications or qualifications on lieutenant governors who become governor after a vacancy. The newly ascended governor has the full powers and duties granted to all governors. Nobody called Theodore Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson interim presidents when they assumed office. The state constitution is clear that Hochul shouldn’t be described that way either. We give Suozzi’s statement a Pants on Fire rating.",/factchecks/2022/jan/10/tom-suozzi/suozzi-calling-hochul-interim-governor-s-misleadin/

Wilder is half-right about his crime record as Richmond's mayor
","Former Gov. Doug Wilder says he’s ""very concerned"" about crime in Richmond and the city should rededicate itself to public safety strategies from his days as mayor.  ""When I became mayor of the City of Richmond in 2004, the crime rate was at its highest."" he said during a Jan. 3 WRVA radio interview. ""When I left in 2008, it was at its lowest."" We fact-checked Wilder's claim and found it partially correct.  Wilder did not inherit the highest crime rate in Richmond history when he became mayor on Jan. 2, 2005. The city’s overall crime rate was significantly higher in the 1990s, as were the rates for violent crime and murder. They had been on a slow decline for at least 10 years when Wilder became mayor, according to FBI data. But Wilder is right that when he stepped down as mayor on the first day of 2009, the city’s crime rate was at a low point - at least since 1995, which is the earliest comprehensive data we found. So were the rates for violent crime and murder. Wilder acknowledged to us that he misspoke about inheriting Richmond’s highest crime rate and offered clarification. ""The crime rate was increasing when I became mayor and decreasing when I left,"" he said.  Again, he’s partially right. For history’s sake, let’s take a deeper look. U.S. crime rates soared in the early 1990s and many experts largely blamed it on the crack cocaine epidemic.    Richmond’s overall crime rate in 1995 (again, the earliest record we could find) was 103 offenses per 1,000 residents, according to our computations from FBI data. That is the highwater mark moving forward.  The rate, with a couple of blips, dropped over the next nine years and stood at 80 crimes per 1,000 residents in 2004, the year before Wilder became mayor. It continued to fall throughout Wilder’s term and in 2008, his last full year, the rate was 48 crimes per 1,000.   In 2019, the last year FBI records are available, Richmond’s rate was 40 crimes per 1,000 residents. The violent crime rate was 27 per 1,000 residents in 2004 and dropped to 16 per 1,000 in 2008. In 2019, the rate fell to 11. Richmond’s murder rate was .47 per 1,000 when Wilder became mayor and .16 when he left - a low mark since 1995 that still stands. The number of murders fell from 93 in 2004 to 31 in 2008. Crime rates fell in many U.S. cities during Wilder’s tenure as Richmond’s mayor. Richmond’s drop was steeper than each of three cities we researched: New York, Detroit and Los Angeles. A December 2008 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch attributed Richmond’s lowered rates to community-based policing strategies employed by then-Police Chief Rodney Monroe, a ""drastic increase in police manpower,"" and prosecutors seeking tougher sentences in court.  The Richmond Police Department reported 98 murders in 2021, the most in 24 years, and Wilder says Richmond should recommit to his strategies.  ""It goes beyond murder,"" he told us. ""It goes to actual shootings. Not a day goes by that you don’t read about someone getting shot."" ""It takes a village to fight crime,"" Wilder told us. A review of recent research on how policing affects crime rates, conducted by the Richmond branch of the Federal Reserve last year, found that increases in police presence have been shown to drive down crime. However, the conclusion of the article contained a caveat. ""Crime is an outcome of multiple factors. Education, employment opportunities, poverty, access to housing and health services, food deserts, and many other factors play important and complementary roles in determining crime levels."" The study said ""a holistic and comprehensive approach to address the problem of crime prevention seems to be the most reasonable course of action.""  The murder surge reflects a national trend. The U.S. saw a 29% increase in homicides in 2020, the largest rise since the start of national record keeping began in 1960. Preliminary figures suggest murders may have increased by another 10% in 2021. Experts largely attribute the surge to isolation and economic distress caused by COVID-19 as well as conflicts stemming from social media use. Wilder said, ""When I became mayor of the City of Richmond in 2004, the crime rate was at its highest. When I left in 2008, it was at its lowest."" Wilder did not inherit a record high crime rate when he became mayor in January 2005. The rate was much higher in the 1990s and had been ebbing. When Wilder left office at the start of 2009, Richmond’s overall crime rate was at its lowest level since 1995, which is the farthest back we could find records.

Fact-checking Sotomayor on kids with severe COVID-19
","Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor incorrectly cited statistics about serious cases of COVID-19 among children during oral arguments over the Biden administration’s efforts to mandate vaccines for certain Americans. ""We have over 100,000 children, which we’ve never had before, in serious condition, and many on ventilators"" due to the coronavirus, Sotomayor said Jan. 7, 2022. Her claim is not supported by data.  In all, 82,842 COVID-positive children 17 and younger have been admitted to the hospital since Aug. 1, 2020, according to CDC data. The most recent data available as of Sotomayor’s remark showed 3,342 children were currently hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19, according to federal data. That number rises to 4,652 children if suspected coronavirus cases are included. Both figures represent less than 5% of the number Sotomayor cited. (The Supreme Court press office did not respond to inquiries from PolitiFact.) Sotomayor spoke of serious cases, which might not necessarily mean that the children went to the hospital. The American Academy of Pediatrics reported that as of the end of December, ""child COVID-19 cases are above 100,000."" But it also noted that ""it appears that severe illness due to COVID-19 is uncommon among children."" Serious pediatric coronavirus cases have risen lately — just not as fast or as far as Sotomayor said. The number of pediatric COVID-positive admissions has spiked as the fast-spreading omicron variant has become dominant since mid December. CDC data shows that the frequency of new hospital admissions for patients younger than 17 years old has blown past its previous peak. Still, the pediatric hospitalization rate has remained much lower than that of other age groups. The 1.09 per 100,000 hospitalization rate for children under 18 compares with 2.76 for those between 20 and 29; 3.57 for those between 30 and 39; 3.79 for those between 40 and 49; 5.62 for those between 50 and 59; 8.16 between 60 and 69; and 15.82 for those above age 70.   There is evidence that the youngest children — those from birth to 4 years old, who are not yet approved to take coronavirus vaccines — are seeing two to three times higher rates of coronavirus-positive hospitalization than at any point in the pandemic. ""It’s critically important that we surround them with people who are vaccinated to provide them protection,"" said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky. This elevated rate for children up to age four has reached 4 per 100,000, still well below the rates for middle-aged and elderly patients. Meanwhile, some of the hospitalized children (and patients of other ages) were not admitted to the hospital specifically for coronavirus symptoms, but rather tested positive once admitted for other reasons. Seattle Children’s Hospital critical care chief Dr. John McGuire told the Associated Press that ""most of the COVID-positive kids in the hospital are actually not here for COVID-19 disease. They are here for other issues but happen to have tested positive."" Sotomayor said, ""We have over 100,000 children, which we’ve never had before, in serious condition, and many on ventilators"" due to the coronavirus. While the number of coronavirus-positive pediatric hospitalizations has risen with the spread of the omicron variant, Sotomayor’s number was way off.  At the time she made this comment, federal data showed that fewer than 5,000 coronavirus-positive children were in the hospital. In fact, fewer than 83,000 children have been hospitalized for COVID-19 — cumulatively — since August 2020. There are over 100,000 cases among children, but scientists say that few of those are severe.

Smith says corporate profits hit record high, blames 'overcharging'
","A Democratic congressional candidate in North Carolina says corporations are making more money than they have in seven decades.  Former state Rep. Erica Smith is campaigning to represent North Carolina’s newly-drawn 2nd Congressional District. On Dec. 30, she tweeted: ""Corporate profit margins are at their highest point in 70 years. Corporations are trying to blame inflation on stimulus checks. Meanwhile, they’re overcharging us for gas, medicine, and groceries, and pocketing the difference. It’s a racket."" PolitiFact has written multiple fact checks on inflation, wages and whether the cost of goods is related to presidential policy. Smith’s comments address a different angle of high prices, and we wondered whether she was right. It turns out that, after taxes, corporate profits did hit a 70-year high last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, citing U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. But economists say Smith’s tweet gives a misleading impression about the prices of gas, groceries and medicine. The prices of various goods have climbed as demand has increased for limited supply. Despite that, companies have been able to keep profit margins high by cutting costs and passing higher costs along to consumers, Reuters reported in September. Government numbers, which aren’t adjusted for inflation, were updated on Dec. 22. They show that corporate profits in the quarter ending Sept. 30 tallied $2.7 trillion dollars, the highest level since 1950. Corporate profits in the previous quarter also reached a high as a percentage of gross domestic product. Smith’s campaign cited a Bloomberg News article about the profits, titled: ""Fattest Profits Since 1950 Debunk Wage-Inflation Story of CEOs."" The ""pocketing the difference"" line in Smith’s tweet comes from President Biden, who called out gasoline companies that kept prices high at the pump even as wholesale gas prices started to decline. Bloomberg created a chart showing the gap between wholesale gasoline and the price at the pump, on a rolling five-day average. Bloomberg’s data showed the gap rising from $1.18 per gallon in early August to $1.42 in late November. Yardeni Research, a consulting firm offering financial analysis, in December produced a report on the profit margins of S&P 500 companies. The report shows corporate profit margins at their highest levels since at least 1994. Smith is certainly not the first Democrat to point the finger at corporations during the pandemic. Economists who spoke to PolitiFact NC said the first line of Smith’s tweet is generally accurate. However, some said her comments about companies ""overcharging us for gas, medicine, and groceries"" need additional context. Economists recently told the New York Times that it doesn’t make sense to blame businesses for profit-seeking in recent months, considering that supply is low, demand is high, and the government recently put more money in Americans’ pockets. ""I do not necessarily agree with the claim that the current record level of the profit margin shows that businesses are ‘overcharging us for gas, medicine, and groceries, and pocketing the difference,’"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. Burtless said the Yardeni report shows that ""the current high rate of profitability may be offsetting sharply lower profit rates the same companies experienced in the months in 2020, when the pandemic dramatically reduced the profitability of many companies’ operations."" Exxon Mobil Corp. Last year, Exxon Mobil Corp., for instance, reported a third-quarter profit margin of 9.4%. That figure is the company’s highest since 2017. Meanwhile, gas prices, which plunged in March and April 2020 as the pandemic took hold and fewer people commuted to work, are on average about 67 cents per gallon higher now than they were in January 2020. But prices are lower than they were in portions of 2012, 2013 and 2014, according to GasBuddy, a company that tracks U.S. gas prices.  When it comes to medicine, consumers in America do tend to pay more for prescriptions than those in other countries. Researchers at the University of Southern California and at Brookings found that U.S. consumers account for about 64% to 78% of total pharmaceutical profits. While the prices of some prescription drugs are regulated, AARP in June released a report that said retail prices for 260 widely-used prescription drugs increased in 2020 by an average 2.9%, more than twice the general rate of inflation. As for groceries, economists balked at the notion that local grocers are shaking down customers.  ""Profit margins vary dramatically not only by industry, but by company,"" said Scott Lincicome, a senior fellow in economic studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Historically, grocery stories and gas stations have ""notoriously low profit margins,"" he said in a phone interview. Kroger, one of the largest grocery store chains in the U.S., reported a third-quarter profit margin of 1.5%, down compared to the same period in 2019. The third-quarter figure isn’t historically high. The cause of rising grocery prices is more a tale of supply and demand than of corporate greed, said Lincicome and Dean Baker, an economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic Policy and Research. ""The high prices are a pretty simple story that there is a big jump in demand and no corresponding increase in supply,"" Baker told PolitiFact in an email.  ""I don't see any special conspiracy story there,"" he said. ""I expect prices to moderate as demand falls back to some extent and supply increases."" Smith said ""Corporate profit margins are at their highest point in 70 years … they're overcharging us for gas, medicine, and groceries, and pocketing the difference."" Government data show that Smith is right about the profit margins of companies in the U.S., collectively speaking. Consumers in the U.S. tend to pay more for medicine than consumers in other countries. Oil companies are also making more money lately. However, economists say it’s misleading for Smith to suggest that your neighborhood grocery store or gas station is running what she described as ""a racket.""

Sen. Rand Paul’s ad was wrong claiming there are no omicron hospitalizations; he took the ad down
","Since omicron was detected in late November, early indications have been that it results in milder illness than other variants of COVID-19. But not even one hospitalization? That was the claim from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., in an ad that solicited contributions for his 2022 reelection campaign. ""The COVID hysteria has already gone on too long and these power-hungry bureaucrats don’t want to let go,"" Paul said in a 50-second video ad on Facebook that started running Jan. 4, the day he filed to run for a third term. ""That’s probably why we’re hearing a lot about this new scary omicron variant. ""But let’s be clear. The omicron variant in South Africa, and now California and across the United States, is reported as an illness with mild symptoms. We hope that will play out over the next few weeks as we learn more. But so far, no one has been hospitalized for it. That’s good news."" Are you less likely to need hospitalization if you’re infected with omicron? Yes, those are the early indications, especially if you're vaccinated or have immunity from a previous coronavirus infection. But zero hospitalizations from omicron? Far from it. Omicron was first identified by researchers in South Africa, who reported it to the World Health Organization on Nov. 24. The World Health Organization designated it as a variant of concern two days later. It has spread to at least 110 countries.  The first U.S. case was confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Dec. 1, days after a Californian returned home from South Africa.  On Jan. 4, the CDC estimated that 95.4% of the COVID-19 cases in the United States in the week ending Jan. 1 were the omicron variant and just 4.6% from the delta variant. A month earlier, Omicron’s share was just 0.6%. While there is not comprehensive data on omicron hospitalizations, it’s simply not the case that there have been none. The World Health Organization told PolitiFact it does not have data on COVID-19 infections that are broken down by variant. While early data from South Africa, the United Kingdom and Denmark suggest a reduced risk of hospitalization for omicron compared to delta, increased transmission due to omicron is expected to lead to more hospitalizations, the organization said.  ""It is still unclear to what extent the observed reduction in risk of hospitalization can be attributed to immunity from previous infections or vaccination and to what extent omicron may be less virulent,"" the organization said in an email. Omicron hospitalizations were reported before the ad went live. A study published Jan. 1 found that — of 1,313 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, including 862 omicron patients as of Dec. 20 in the Houston Methodist healthcare system — 15% of omicron patients were hospitalized, compared with 43% of delta variant patients and 55% of alpha patients.  People who contracted the omicron variant were about half as likely to need hospital care as those infected with delta, according to a report issued Dec. 31 by the UK Health Security Agency. The study included 815 people with omicron who were admitted to hospitals or transferred from emergency departments. We reached out Jan. 6 to Paul’s campaign. Deputy campaign manager Jake Cox replied the same day, saying that when the script for the ad was written, there were no confirmed hospitalizations, and that the ad is no longer running.  Facebook says the ad stopped running Jan. 6. Paul ran for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. His leading challenger for reelection is former Kentucky state lawmaker Charles Booker, who narrowly lost the Democratic nomination for Kentucky’s other U.S. Senate seat in 2020.  In a campaign fund-raising ad for his reelection, Paul stated: ""No one has been hospitalized for"" the omicron variant of COVID-19.

Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""The immune evasive properties of the variant allow it to infect fully vaccinated, and even boosted, individuals.

Omicron is more resistant than delta to immunity from vaccines or from a prior infection, said Dr. Thomas A. Russo, a professor of infectious diseases at the University at Buffalo who treats COVID-19 patients. ""That’s why we’re seeing more infections in the vaccinated,"" Russo said. But there’s ""no question"" that people who are vaccinated have more protection, Russo said.  ""Vaccination does not increase the likelihood that you’ll get infected. It’s really quite the opposite,"" he said: Vaccination protects against infection, severe disease and bad outcomes.  The high incidence of infections among vaccinated people is occurring in certain countries not because they are more susceptible to the virus than unvaccinated people, but rather because there are so many more of them than there are unvaccinated people. ""As the proportion of vaccinated increases, they’ll have an increasing contribution to the infection pool,"" he said.  Dr. George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco, said it’s ""nonsense"" to claim that people who are vaccinated are at higher risk of disease.  PolitiFact has looked at other claims about high rates of omicron infection among vaccinated people, and the statistics behind them.

The report had substantially undercounted the number of unvaccinated people who were infected. A blog post claimed that data from around the world showed that the fast-spreading omicron variant of COVID-19 ""favors people who are fully vaccinated.""

But those claims were made based on an error in the report that has since been corrected.  A headline in The Gateway Pundit reads ""Germany: 96% of Latest Omicron Patients were FULLY Vaccinated – Only 4% Unvaccinated."" The Dec. 30 Koch report Gateway Pundit was referring to said it detected 4,020 omicron cases among fully vaccinated people and 186 omicron cases among unvaccinated people. But Koch corrected those numbers on Jan. 5, saying the number of cases among those who were unvaccinated was actually 1,097. Using these corrected figures and the same mathematical processes that Gateway Pundit used as the basis for its headline, it would seem the percentage of omicron cases among unvaccinated people accounted for 21%, not 4% as the Gateway Pundit headline suggested. But, even using those figures, a spokesperson for the Robert Koch Institute cautioned against drawing any sort of conclusion from the statistics about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.   ""The effectiveness of the vaccination cannot be calculated from these figures,"" spokesperson Susan Glasmacher told us in an email. ""For that, you have to take into account the number of vaccinated people in the population."" Germany has administered more than 152 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to its population and reports 71.6% of its population is fully vaccinated, including 87% those over 60. Nearly 42% of those who are vaccinated have also received a booster shot.  If a country’s vaccination rate is high, it is expected that the relative proportion of fully vaccinated people among all COVID-19 patients is also high. PolitiFact has tackled similar misleading claims about the rate of COVID-19 infection in the United Kingdom, where vaccination rates are also high, especially in older populations. Snopes fact checkers said the initial 4% claim that we also found in the Gateway Pundit story  came from a German journalist who calculated that from the incorrect report and has since tweeted a correction. PolitiFact reached out to the author of the Gateway Pundit story, who did not respond to us. But while we were working on the check, the story was updated with a correction. A Gateway Pundit article said that in Germany, 96% of new omicron cases were from fully vaccinated people. That calculation was based on incorrect numbers in a report from the Robert Koch Institute. It initially said there were 186 cases among unvaccinated people but later corrected the report to show there were 1,097 cases. The institute also cautioned against drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines based on this research as it does not account for the nation’s high rate of vaccination.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2022/jan/07/gateway-pundit/report-about-omicron-cases-germany-was-based-incor/

The COVID-19 vaccines won’t lead to the deaths of a half million sharks
","Could the battle to end the COVID-19 pandemic be jeopardizing the shark population? That’s what one alarming — albeit misleading — claim shared on Facebook asserts. Hundreds of thousands of sharks are at risk of dying, says the Dec. 19, 2021, post featuring an image of a jumping shark, because of the way the vaccine is made. ""Half a million sharks could be killed to make the COVID-19 vaccine,"" text under the photo reads. ""Once again, it’s the animal which has to make a sacrifice for humans."" The post, which we found on a Facebook page called ""Unknown Facts,"" was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Although the post doesn’t mention a specific vaccine or how COVID-19 vaccines are linked to shark deaths, it appears to be referring to an oil-based compound typically made from shark livers called squalene that is often used in the health and cosmetics industry. Shark Allies, an advocacy group, in late 2020 issued a statement that seems to be the basis of this claim. The group said that 500,000 sharks could be potentially killed to meet the demand of mass producing a vaccine. The New York Times looked into that figure and was not able to substantiate it. Squalene can help boost immunity and aid in skin hydration. It is found in plants and animals, including humans, but sharks are considered one of the best sources as they carry high amounts of the compound. Some vaccines, including the Fluad influenza vaccine approved in the U.S. for people 65 and older, use squalene as an adjuvant to help trigger a stronger immune response in the body, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  But of the 137 COVID-19 vaccines that have been in development globally during the pandemic, three listed squalene as an ingredient, according to the World Health Organization's vaccine tracker, but none of those have reached approval stages: None of the vaccines that have been approved for use in the U.S. — Moderna, Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson — contain the compound. And of the nine that have been approved for use globally, so far none of them contain squalene as an adjuvant. In its reporting on the Shark Allies claim, The New York Times noted that an estimated 63 million to 273 million sharks are already caught and killed by humans each year, and squalene is harvested from millions of them.  But the Times found that figuring out the number of sharks that would be needed to produce the squalene for a vaccine involved too many variables, including requiring that an overwhelming majority of the squalene-free COVID-19 vaccines would first need to fail before those containing the ingredient would even be in the mix.  A Facebook post claimed that a half million sharks could be killed in order to make the COVID-19 vaccines. Squalene is used in several vaccines to help elicit a stronger immune response in the body. But the nine COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved for use across the globe do not contain the compound. Three of 137 vaccines in development worldwide for COVID-19 suggest using squalene as an ingredient, but only two of those have progressed in clinical trials and there is no guarantee they will be approved for use. Finally, calculating the number of sharks it would take to produce a vaccine that uses squalene relies on too many variables to make the half million figure reliable. We rate this claim as False.",/factchecks/2022/jan/07/facebook-posts/covid-19-vaccines-wont-lead-deaths-half-million-sh/

There’s no evidence electric vehicles fare worse than gas-powered cars in long traffic jams
","A major snowstorm in Virginia this week left hundreds of motorists stranded in freezing conditions on Interstate 95, some of them for more than 24 hours. That led a social media user to warn of what would have happened if more of those cars had been electric vehicles. ""Imagine if half the cars in the traffic jam on I-95 in Virginia last night were electric vehicles. And half of those were to run out of battery power,"" A Facebook post on Jan. 4 said. ""All those people would be stuck in freezing temperatures without a heated vehicle. And all the cars would be stuck unable to move because you can’t bring a charging station to them. In effect all those electric cars would become roadblocks to the gasoline powered vehicles. Just something to think about when you hear politicians pushing electric vehicles over gasoline and diesel."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post suggests electric vehicles would have been more prone to failure in such conditions than gasoline-powered cars and trucks. Others raised similar concerns, including a Washington Post columnist, who shared a tweet from a trucker who recounted his experience with a Tesla driver who was worried about running out of power. But are such worries grounded in reality? Many variables affect how a given electric vehicle would fare in such a situation, including the type of battery it has, the heating system it uses and whether the vehicle was fully charged before the trip. But there’s no evidence that EVs generally would be more prone to failure in a traffic jam like the one that happened in Virginia. The range of an electric vehicle varies widely by model, from 110 miles in the Mini Cooper Electric to up to 373 miles in the Tesla Model S. And cold weather can diminish the range of an EV, according to automakers and tests by Consumer Reports.  But when idling, as in a standstill traffic jam, an EV behaves differently from a gas-powered vehicle. An electric vehicle’s motor doesn’t run when the car is stationary, so the only draw on the battery is for the heating system and other electrical accessories. Drivers idling in a gas-powered vehicle would need to keep the engine running, and gasoline burning, to keep the heat on. In December, PolitiFact looked into a similar claim that said electric vehicles are more likely to fail in traffic jams in cold weather. We found that to be false because the vehicles don’t use much power while at a standstill or in their climate settings. To understand the energy capacity of an EV’s battery, Peter Wells, director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff Business School in Wales, told PolitiFact that the average U.S. house uses 30 kilowatt-hours of power per day, so a fully charged 62 kilowatt-hour battery in an electric car could power a house for two days. Even half-charged, a 62 kWh battery could yield 10 to 15 hours of heating in a car that’s stationary during a traffic jam, Wells said. A gasoline car’s heating or air conditioning, on the other hand, wouldn’t be able to operate without the engine running and consuming fuel to power the compressor and other parts. Jeremy Michalek, co-founder of the Vehicle Electrification Group and an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said cold weather can cut an electric vehicle’s range, in miles, by as much as half, citing a study he co-authored. But range is a function of a moving car. While idling, a gas-powered vehicle, assuming a full tank of 15 to 18 gallons, could take anywhere from about a day to up to a week to burn through that gas, Michalek said. A stationary Tesla Model 3, he said, could exhaust its battery in as little as eight hours or as much as a few days, depending on the wattage of the heater. So which would fare better stuck in a daylong traffic jam like the one in Virginia? It depends, Michalek said, on how comfortable someone needs to be, whether the car has a heat pump and other factors. ""Bottom line: A gasoline vehicle can keep the cabin warm while idling for a longer period, on average, but in practice it will depend on how much energy is left in each vehicle at the time it is stranded and how efficiently the heating options are used,"" Michalek said. ""For example, electric seats in EVs can be more efficient at keeping an adult body warm than heating the whole cabin in an emergency situation."" It is easier to refuel a car that runs out of gas in a traffic jam than to recharge an electric vehicle, which can take hours, but no car is really built to outlast a 24-hour traffic jam. Dozens of vehicles were left abandoned or ran out of gas in the Virginia jam and had to be towed, the Washington Post reported. An electric vehicle that runs out of battery power on the road would typically need to be towed to  a location where it could be recharged. But some new options are becoming available. Blink Charging Co. in Miami sells a portable charger for use by roadside assistance services to supply EVs with enough battery power to get to a charging station, and Lightning Mobile is developing a mobile electric charging station that it hopes to sell to operators of commercial electric vehicle fleets, according to Automotive News.  A Facebook post implied that a massive traffic pileup during a Virginia snowstorm would have been far worse with more electric vehicles on the road. Cold weather can diminish the range of an electric vehicle that’s moving. But there is no evidence to suggest electric vehicles idling in standstill traffic would have fared any worse than gas-powered vehicles, which need a running engine to provide heat and can run out of gas while idling.  Electric vehicles don’t use much energy while idling, and drivers can use even less by using the seat warmers instead of the heating system. We rate this claim False. Monique Curet contributed to this fact-check.",/factchecks/2022/jan/07/facebook-posts/theres-no-evidence-electric-vehicles-fare-worse-ga/

No, Pfizer did not report $37 billion in profit for its latest quarter
","With a sarcastic tribute, a Facebook post accuses COVID-19 vaccine maker Pfizer of generating outsize profits at the expense of the U.S. taxpayer.  ""Pfizer wants to thank… all the taxpayers for a record $37 billion profit last quarter,"" the Dec. 23 post said. ""Special thanks goes out to the 800 lobbyists and all the bought and paid for politicians. Couldn’t have done it without your great cooperation."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim gives an inaccurate figure for Pfizer’s quarterly profit, overstating it by a factor of more than four. The COVID-19 vaccine has been a big seller for Pfizer, which has shipped billions of doses to the U.S. government and other countries since it was first authorized for emergency use in December 2020. The need for booster shots to combat new variants of the coronavirus has increased demand.  In the third quarter of 2021, Pfizer reported that its vaccine, Comirnaty, generated $13 billion in global revenue, accounting for more than half the company’s total revenue of $24.09 billion for the quarter.  For the first nine months of the year, Pfizer said, more than 75% of revenues for Comirnaty came from supplying countries outside the U.S. The company said in November that it expected full-year revenue for 2021 to be about $81 billion, with $36 billion of that coming from Comirnaty. Pfizer plans to release its fourth-quarter 2021 results Feb. 8. But the claim in the Facebook post talks about profit, not revenue. Revenue is the total income a company generates through sales. Profit is the amount of money left over after operating expenses, debt service and other costs.  Pfizer’s third-quarter net income was $8.15 billion, about five times the year-earlier figure, but less than a quarter of what the claim says. A Facebook post claims Pfizer made $37 billion in profit in the latest quarter. That’s inaccurate. The company generated $24.09 billion in revenue in the third quarter, more than half of that coming from its COVID-19 vaccine.  Its profit for the quarter was $8.15 billion.  We rate this claim False.   ",/factchecks/2022/jan/07/facebook-posts/no-pfizer-did-not-report-37-billion-profit-its-lat/

Advocate misses mark on claim half the population pays at least half their income for housing
","With the heart of winter approaching, and two people already found dead on Milwaukee streets, there is a renewed focus on homelessness. And with it, housing affordability. Joe Volk, executive director of the Wisconsin Coalition Against Homelessness, connected the two in a Nov. 17, 2021 appearance on PBS Wisconsin’s ""Noon Wednesday,"" part of its ""Here & Now"" franchise:   ""In Wisconsin,"" he said, ""we have 50% of the population paying 50%, 60%, 70%, sometimes 80% for their housing so it should be no surprise then that the littlest thing, much less a pandemic, in these people’s lives is going to cause them not to be able to pay their rent."" That figure – at least half the population paying at least half their income for housing – caught our attention. Is he right? Volk is off the mark because he spoke so broadly. Had he focused more clearly just on renters, he would have been closer – but even then he underestimated the percentage. Let’s dig in. In making the claim, Volk spoke of ""50% of the population,"" a statement that includes, well, everybody – homeowners and renters alike. Yet later he mentioned difficulty paying rent, which would narrow things.  As such, we are muddled from the start. When asked for backup, Volk said he was referring to an annual state-by-state report about rent burden released by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for decent and affordable housing for everyone.  The group’s 2021 report uses U.S. Census data, including from the American Community Survey from 2019. The report found that Wisconsin was one of 16 states – including Illinois, Idaho and Michigan – that had 31 to 40 affordable and available rental homes per 100 renter households classified as extremely low income. In Wisconsin’s case, the number was 37. By that measure, California, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Delaware and Florida rank as some of the worst states, all with 30 or fewer affordable and available rental homes. Wyoming and Mississippi rank as the best states with 61. But Volk’s claim was not about a ranking, just about the percentages. So, what can we glean from the study? As of 2021, there are more than 2.3 million households in Wisconsin. Of that, 777,217 are renter households – with 188,097 of those households falling into the ""severely cost-burdened"" category, per the data. The report defined ""extremely low-income renters"" as those making 30% of the area’s median income. In Wisconsin, that would be $24,394 or less. So, that piece of the pie is getting smaller. Of the ""extremely low-income renters'' in Wisconsin, more than half are ""severely cost burdened,"" according to Andrew Aurand, Vice President for Research at the National Low Income Housing Coalition. That is, they spend more than 50% of their income on housing costs, including rent and utilities. The median housing-cost-to-income ratio among extremely low-income renters in Wisconsin is 67%, meaning the median extremely low-income renter spends 67% of their income on housing and many spend far more than that, Aurand said. But remember: That is a subset of renters, not all renters – much less all households. ""More generally speaking, renters in Wisconsin are more likely to be severely cost-burdened than homeowners (19% vs. 6%) because owners typically have higher incomes,"" Aurand explained in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. So, by that measure, far fewer than 50% of renters  – let alone all households – are paying more than half their income on housing. As such, not only is Volk’s statement more off base, it’s also completely wrong. In connecting affordable housing and the pandemic to homelessness, Volk claimed: ""In Wisconsin, we have 50% of the population paying 50%, 60%, 70%, sometimes 80% for their housing."" But the study he cited is far narrower than the way he stated the claim, which can be read as applying to all households, renter and homeowner alike.  In fact, far less than 50% of Wisconsin’s population is severely cost-burdened – meaning that they pay more than 50% of their income on housing costs, including rent and utilities. We rate the claim False.  ",/factchecks/2022/jan/07/joe-volk/advocate-misses-mark-claim-half-population-pays-le/
