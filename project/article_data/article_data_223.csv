Rick Perry wrongly downplays human role in climate change
","Energy Secretary Rick Perry downplayed the role of human activity in the recent rise in the Earth’s temperature, saying natural causes are likely the main driver of climate change. Perry was asked in a CNBC interview if he believed carbon dioxide was the ""primary control knob"" for the earth’s temperature. ""No. Most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in,"" Perry said in the June 19 interview. We decided to investigate Perry’s claim about climate change’s main cause, which scientists have likened to a ""control knob."" Perry’s claim flies in the face of settled science. The world’s leading authority on climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has concluded that human activity is ""extremely likely"" to be the main driver of warming since the mid 20th century. While it’s still possible to find dissenters, scientists around the globe generally agree with this conclusion. The graph below, based on work by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, shows just how closely human activity syncs with the earth’s rising temperature, especially since 1950. The blue line shows how human factors (land use, ozone, aerosols and greenhouse gases) have contributed to global warming. The black line is the Earth’s recorded temperature since 1880.  This is not to say natural factors don’t affect the climate. They do. But Perry is wrong to call them the main cause of the earth’s rising temperature. When you look at how natural causes (orbital and solar changes plus volcanic activity) have contributed to climate change, it’s clear the impact is less than that of human factors.  Perry is also wrong to say ocean waters are responsible for the uptick in temperature. While oceans are a vital part of the climate system, and variations in their circulation can affect local climates in important ways, they don’t account for global warming, said Gavin Schmidt, climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. ""We have concluded close to all of the recent trends in global temperature is due to human activity, and CO2 is the dominant factor,"" Schmidt said, referring to carbon dioxide. Perry misidentified climate change’s main ""control knob,"" but he’s not the first Trump administration department head to fudge the facts on our warming planet. We previously issued a False rating to Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt’s claim that carbon dioxide is not ""a primary contributor to the global warming that we see."" In fact, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that collects in the earth’s atmosphere and traps excess heat. It has functioned like a ""primary control knob"" that’s been dialed up dramatically since humans began releasing significantly more amounts of CO2 into the air, mostly by burning fossil fuels, at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. ""A reasonable analogy can be drawn between the way that atmospheric CO2 controls the global temperature of the Earth, and how your house thermostat controls the temperature of your house,"" said Andrew Lacis, a climatologist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The NASA graph below shows the influence of greenhouse gas emissions, including a 40 percent increase in atmospheric CO2 since 1750 (green line), on the Earth’s temperature (black line).  Energy Secretary Rick Perry said, ""Most likely the primary control knob (for the earth’s temperature) is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in."" Perry’s claim contradicts settled science. While natural factors certainly affect the climate, human factors are the main contributor to global warming, and carbon dioxide has acted as the ""primary control knob"" governing the earth’s relatively recent uptick in temperature. We rate Perry’s statement False. ",/factchecks/2017/jun/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-wrongly-downplays-human-role-climate-ch/

Following Trump voter fraud allegations, claim that 5.7 million noncitizens voted is wrong
","President Donald Trump’s unfounded allegations that millions voted illegally in 2016 is back in the news, with his supporters pointing to a new analysis that claims millions of undocumented immigrants voted in 2008. Fox and Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt talked about it on the morning show recently. ""5.7 million -- that’s how many illegal immigrants might have voted"" in 2008, she said. Her comments referenced an article in the Washington Times, a conservative newspaper. Trump has made repeated claims about massive voter fraud and election rigging, which we’ve debunked again and again and again and again and again and again and again (and we debunked a claim by his spokesman Sean Spicer). The claim made on Fox and Friends is based on an extrapolation of a controversial study that relied on a very small number of responses. Researchers involved in the underlying survey of voters have cautioned against using their data to reach conclusions about noncitizen voters. We emailed a spokeswoman for Fox News and did not get a reply; however, the Washington Times article showed that the information came from Just Facts, a think tank that describes itself as conservative/libertarian and was founded by James D. Agresti, a mechanical engineer in New Jersey. Agresti’s conclusions are based on data from a paper by Old Dominion University researchers who used data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, or CCES. He multiplied the findings in that data with U.S. Census Bureau estimates of the noncitizen population to come up with a conclusion about the number of noncitizen voters nationwide. It’s important to note that the CCES researchers have disputed the conclusions Old Dominion researchers reached about noncitizen voters. Here’s how the studies unfolded: In 2008, the CCES surveyed 32,800 adults nationwide online about their political views. Respondents answered at least 100 questions before they made it to the citizenship question, one of the last questions asked. The survey showed that 339 identified themselves as noncitizens -- about 1 percent of the total respondents. Then of the 339 self-identified noncitizens, 39 of those claim to have voted, said Brian Schaffner, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, one of the main researchers. That’s 39 respondents out of 32,800 people who are now being used to extrapolate millions of illegal voters. Schaffner has warned that with a subset that small, the responses might be unreliable. ""Survey respondents occasionally select the wrong response by accident—perhaps because they are rushing through and not reading the questions carefully, because they do not fully understand the terminology being used, or because they simply click on the wrong box on the page,"" Schaffner wrote in a Politico magazine article after the November election. Subsequent CCES surveys provide more evidence that some respondents answered the question wrong. There were 20 respondents who identified themselves as citizens in 2010 but then in 2012 changed their answers to indicate that they were noncitizens, which Schaffer said is ""highly unrealistic."" In 2014, researchers at Old Dominion University used the CCES data in 2008 and 2010, as well as voter records in 2008, to conclude that more than 14 percent of noncitizens indicated that they were registered to vote. Their best guess at the portion of noncitizens who voted was about 6.4 percent, or 1.2 million votes cast. The researchers at CCES (including Schaffner; Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard political scientist; and Samantha Luks, managing director of scientific research at YouGov) have criticized the methodology used by Old Dominion. They said it didn’t fully consider the possibility that people responded to the survey inaccurately. ""You are ignoring the measurement error in a very small group which is going to inflate those numbers,"" Schaffner said, ""then you assume this is a random sample of all noncitizens in the country, which it probably isn’t."" More than 100 political scientists from universities and colleges wrote an open letter in January disputing the Old Dominion paper as evidence for Trump’s claim that millions of noncitizens voted. ""In a survey as large as the CCES, even a small rate of response error (where people incorrectly mark the wrong item on a survey) can lead to incorrect conclusions,"" they wrote. ""The scholarly political science community has generally rejected the findings in the Richman et al. study and we believe it should not be cited or used in any debate over fraudulent voting."" Jesse Richman, one of the Old Dominion researchers and a political science professor, told PolitiFact he still stands by his research and responded to the criticisms by CCES researchers in a working paper in February. Agresti of Just Facts, the source of the numbers cited on Fox and Friends, used the same data from CCES and Old Dominion and concluded that between 594,000 to 5.7 million noncitizens voted illegally in the 2008 election. Agresti said his number on the high end of his range was higher than Old Dominion because he used different methodology in his calculations. Setting aside surveys, another way to find noncitizen voters is to examine state voter records and compare that with data about immigration status. But states have struggled with attempts to do that. Florida tried before the 2012 election and scrapped the effort amid many errors. We interviewed other election experts: Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine; Lorraine Minnite, political science professor at Rutgers University; and Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who has tracked voter fraud allegations since 2000. All three rejected Agresti’s conclusions. There have been some instances of noncitizens voting, but actual evidence has shown small numbers among millions of votes cast nationwide. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who co-chairs Trump’s voter fraud commission, has obtained a total of one conviction for noncitizen voting since 2015. North Carolina’s 2016 post-election audit showed a few dozen noncitizen voters out of 4.8 million votes cast. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted announced in February that since he took office in 2011, he has identified 126 noncitizens who cast ballots. Fox and Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, ""5.7 million -- that’s how many illegal immigrants might have voted"" in 2008. The number comes from a conclusion by Just Facts, a conservative/libertarian think tank. Just Facts’ numbers came from a study by Old Dominion University researchers. That study was based on a survey which showed that 39 people out 32,800 claimed to be noncitizens who had voted. Just Facts used data from the study and Census estimates on the noncitizen population to come up with a national figure of noncitizen voters. But other researchers and political scientists have said the small number is not a reliable source of data on noncitizen voters nationwide. We rate this claim False.

It's fake news that the United States didn't land on the moon
","An Internet post claiming that high-ranking Chinese officials had called the American moon landing a ""complete hoax"" is a fake news story that has been in circulation for years: A new scandal has happened after high ranking officials from the Chinese space program called the American moon landing ""a complete hoax"", the Beijing Daily Express reports. The claims came after the Chinese moon rover allegedly couldn’t find any proof of American landings on the Moon. The rover took thousands of photos and after analyzing them the Chinese discovered that there’s no trace of these moon landings. The post attributes the quote to the Beijing Daily Express, a publication we found no record of. It also points to thousands of photos taken by the Chinese Yutu moon rover, which launched in December 2013 and ceased to operate in July 2016, stating these ""showed no trace"" of the Apollo moon landing. While the rover did take many photos, Andrew Jones, a journalist following China’s space program, points out that Yutu landed far from the Apollo landing site, so there wouldn’t be evidence one way or another. ""It had traveled tens of meters in total, when it would have needed to travel thousands of kilometers over varying and hazardous terrain to visit all the Apollo landing sites,"" Jones said. ""Yutu, with designed minimum lifetime of three (Earth) months and a range of up to 10 kilometers, lasted 31 months on the Moon, but was stationary for the vast majority of this."" The Lunar Reconnaissance Spacecraft has captured ample evidence of the Apollo landing, though, which can be seen in this database. This is the same spacecraft that the Chinese space agency used to determine Yutu’s landing site. In addition to photographs, the Apollo mission brought back rock samples that have fueled decades of scientific research, and are available upon request from NASA. ""So far, no one has seen those samples and declared them to be fake,"" director of space policy at Planetary Society Casey Dreier said. The story also claims the Chinese space program launched a petition demanding the United States declassify NASA information regarding the U.S. moon landing, signed by 200 of its highest-ranking officials. But the petition is nowhere to be found and alleged signee and ""world renowned nuclear engineer"" Yury Ignatyevich Mukhin is actually renowned in fake news circles as a Russian conspiracy theorist denying all moon landings. The only information available about him online, though, has been produced by Mukhin himself, leading Wikipedia to cast serious doubt on his profile.

White House tweet wrongly says Obamacare led to fewer insurance options
","In its drive to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, the Trump administration turned to Twitter with a list of how bad the program is. ""Obamacare has led to higher costs and fewer health insurance options for millions of Americans. It has failed the American people,"" it tweeted June 21. An accompanying video described multiple failings. #Obamacare has led to higher costs and fewer health insurance options for millions of Americans. It has failed the American people. pic.twitter.com/xmhT82w3Ii One of its attack lines jumped out at us as particularly wrong: that Obamacare has led to fewer health insurance options for millions of Americans. On its face, it is wrong. Before passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, many Americans either couldn’t afford insurance or were denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions. That changed with Obamacare. A 2016 estimate from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department put the number of people who gained coverage at 20 million. That included 2.3 million young adults who took advantage of a provision in the law that allowed them to stay on their parents’ plans until they turned 26. The remaining 17.7 million got coverage through either a private plan or public insurance, primarily Medicaid. ""Americans inherently have more access to care then they did before Obamacare,"" said Timothy Callaghan, a health policy professor at the Texas A&M School of Public Health. The drop in the uninsured rate gives another way to look at this. Gallup, a major polling organization, reported that by the first quarter of 2016, the fraction of people ages 18 to 64 without insurance had fallen to 11 percent. ""This marks a record low since Gallup and Healthways began tracking the uninsured rate in 2008,"" the report said. In 2008, the rate was 14.6 percent.  Part of the decline was due to an improving economy. About half of Americans get their insurance through their employer. Part was tied to the individual mandate, the provision in the health care law that required all adults to have insurance. Another factor was the expansion of Medicaid for poor people, an option chosen by about 36 states. That provided coverage to about 10.7 million people who weren’t eligible before, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted source of neutral data. The White House statement does apply in a more limited sense. The video included the statistic about insurance companies deciding not to offer policies on the health insurance exchanges set up under the law. The original idea of the exchanges was to have companies competing for business. In many counties, particularly rural ones, it hasn’t turned out that way, said Daniel Polsky, professor of health management at the Wharton School. ""Fewer plan options will be available when compared to the early years of the Affordable Care Act,"" Polsky said.   He called that ""an unfortunate aspect"" of the law, but noted that the White House has added to instability inside the exchanges. Despite requests from insurance companies, the administration has not promised to continue payments that make policies affordable, plus it has indicated it won’t enforce the individual mandate. The exchanges represent a small slice of the insurance market. It’s for people who don’t get insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid or Medicare. The individual market covers about 7 percent of all Americans, and slightly more than half of those policies are sold on the exchanges. We reached out to the White House for this fact-check and did not hear back before we published. The White House tweeted that Obamacare has led to fewer health insurance options for millions of Americans. About 20 million more people have insurance today than before, directly as a result of the new health care law. The White House neglects that critical point. The sole thread of truth is that with the insurance exchanges set up by the law, the number of carriers has dwindled. That is a real problem, but as experts and insurance companies have noted, that is partly a result of what this administration has done. Its policies on spending and enforcement have undercut the ability of carriers to participate in the exchanges.

Ken Paxton inaccurately says Barack Obama repeatedly admitted his 2014 immigration edict was illegal
","A Texas Republican, pleased at the revocation of a federal effort to shield older immigrants from deportation, elaborated that then-President Barack Obama repeatedly acknowledged that his administration's 2014 immigration order wasn’t legal. In a June 2017 press release, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton applauded the June 5, 2017, Department of Homeland Security decision rescinding the Obama-era policy memo announcing the program to protect parents of certain immigrants from deportation. The Obama-era effort, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, never took effect after Texas and 25 other states persuaded a federal district judge to block implementation--a move ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court. Paxton said: ""I applaud President (Donald) Trump for acknowledging what President Obama himself acknowledged over 20 times – the Obama Administration’s DAPA immigration edict was a violation of law and the separation of powers."" We requested the basis of Paxton’s claim that Obama had, over 20 times, said DAPA was offered in violation of federal law. Kayleigh Lovvorn in Paxton’s state office answered by email: ""All of Barack Obama’s quotes on the subject are documented, archived, and available online."" Checking Obama’s statements We’ve been over such turf before though Paxton’s claim that Obama said the DAPA in particular violated the law adds a twist. In December 2014, we gave Mostly True ratings to statements by a U.S. House member and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to the effect that Obama had many times said he couldn’t act to protect immigrants from deportation unless Congress revised immigration laws. U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, said at a December 2014 hearing of Obama’s past statements on immigration: ""The president said over 20 times that he did not have the legal authority to do this, to take this executive action, and that this is not how democracy works."" McCaul’s count was overly high, we found. But Obama had often said through March 2014 that absent congressional action, he couldn’t do more by himself to protect immigrants living in the country without legal permission. In a 2015 interview, Abbott said: ""22 times Barack Obama said he did not have the authority to implement this type of"" anti-deportation ""measure. And then the day after he signed this into law, he said, quote, ‘I just changed the law.’"" Like McCaul, we found, Abbott overstated the confirmed instances of Obama indicating he couldn’t independently do more to prevent deportations. Obama’s statements since DAPA Notably, those fact-checks were based on statements that Obama made long before announcing DAPA. In contrast, Obama insisted he was within the law when he announced DAPA  in November 2014 as a follow-up to his administration’s established effort to keep certain young immigrants from being deported (as of June 2017, the older program--Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--was left intact by the Trump administration). A 2014 memo from the federal Office of Legal Counsel said DAPA fell within Homeland Security’s discretionary powers to enforce immigration laws. That office, in the Justice Department, is responsible for providing authoritative legal advice to the president and executive-branch agencies. In announcing DAPA, Obama changed his declared position on his ability to act unilaterally as PolitiFact noted at the time. Obama told the country he was launching DAPA to delay deportations of unauthorized immigrants who had lived in the U.S. for more than five years and who had children who were citizens or had green cards. The intent was that if an applicant could pass a background check and pay a fee, he or she could qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time. Obama also reaffirmed that he’d have preferred Congress act on comprehensive immigration reform. Regardless, he said: ""The actions I’m taking are not only lawful, they’re the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and every single Democratic president for the past half century."" After Paxton made his 2017 claim, we searched for post-2014 instances of Obama saying he didn’t have the authority to impose the DAPA--and came up empty. Obama in May 2015 vowed to defend his authority to carry out DAPA. As reported by the Miami Herald, Obama said: ""In the short term, if Mr. [Mitch] McConnell, the leader of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, want to have a vote on whether what I’m doing is legal or not, they can have that vote. I will veto that vote because I’m absolutely confident that what we’re doing is the right thing to do."" A footnote in a legal brief filed by Texas and other states pointed us to Obama’s comment to reporters in June 2015, after a federal district judge held up DAPA, indicating the president believed he’d acted legally. Obama said then: ""I am absolutely convinced this is well within my legal authority, Department of Homeland Security’s legal authority.  If you look at the precedent, if you look at the traditional discretion that the executive branch possesses when it comes to applying immigration laws, I am convinced that what we’re doing is lawful, and our lawyers are convinced that what we’re doing is lawful."" Obama’s pre-DAPA calls for congressional action Then again, Obama was previously clear about needing Congress to act first. The March 2015 legal brief filed by Texas and other states led us to a January 2015 article in the Texas Review of Law & Politics presenting many of the Obama quotations we’d confirmed for the McCaul and Abbott fact-checks. Here are a few of the times when Obama seemed to say that he lacked independent legal authority to act on immigration: In October 2010, Obama told Eddie ""Piolin"" Sotelo, a radio host on Spanish-speaking Univision, that he couldn’t achieve comprehensive immigration reform without congressional action. ""I am president, I am not king,"" Obama said. ""... I’m committed to making it happen, but I’ve got to have some partners to do it."" At a Univision event in March 2011, Obama was asked if he could stop deportations of students with an order. That’s ""just not the case,"" Obama said, ""because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed... Congress passes the law. The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws."" Simply issuing such an order, he said, ""would not conform with my appropriate role as president."" Yet he also hinted at wiggle room, saying: ""That does not mean, though, that we can't make decisions, for example, to emphasize enforcement on those who’ve engaged in criminal activity. In an April 2011 speech in Miami and the next month in El Paso, Obama said he couldn’t bypass Congress and change immigration laws himself, saying that’s not how a democracy works. Addressing the National Council of La Raza in July 2011, Obama drew exhortations to act without waiting for congressional agreement. He called that idea ""tempting,"" then said ""that's not how our system works."" In September 2012, Obama was asked if he would follow up his recent protective move for students by doing something similar for non-criminal immigrants such as the parents of U.S.-born children. Obama replied that ""as the head of the executive branch, there’s a limit to what I can do… we’re still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally,"" as in parents deported. At a presidential debate the next month, Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney were asked: ""What do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green card that are currently living here as productive members of society?"" Obama said: ""I've done everything that I can on my own."" In a January 2013 Telemundo interview, Obama was asked why he couldn’t protect mothers living here without authorization from deportation as he had aided law-abiding students. ""I’m not a king,"" Obama replied, tracking his response the same month to a similar query from Univision and his reply at a February 2013 Google Hangout town hall where he also said ""we’ve kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can."" The same year, Obama was asked by Telemundo if he would consider freezing deportations of the parents of students benefiting from the administration’s 2012 action. Obama replied that if he broadened his protective orders, ""then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option."" We previously confirmed similar statements by Obama in a November 2013 speech in in San Francisco and a March 2014 Univision interview. Our ruling Paxton said Obama ""acknowledged over 20 times"" that his administration’s DAPA ""immigration edict was a violation of law and the separation of powers."" Paxton might have been trying to revisit mostly accurate earlier claims about what Obama once repeatedly said. But there are significant differences between the earlier statements and this one. Paxton specified that Obama was speaking about his DAPA policy; in fact, Obama’s statements were made long before DAPA was announced and were not about a specific policy initiative. Contrary to Paxton’s statement, Obama has always maintained the DAPA policy was legal. We find that Paxton’s statement has an element of truth but ignores the critical fact that Obama has stood by his DAPA policy since it was issued. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Ann Coulter says Trump granted amnesty to nearly 100,000 'Dreamers.' Is that true?
","Conservative pundit Ann Coulter, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump during the presidential campaign, is calling him out for stalling on key immigration promises, including the deportation of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants.  Trump campaigned on a hardline stance against immigrants who violated immigration laws, promising to deport them and to ""immediately terminate"" programs created during the Obama administration. One of those programs, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), gives deportation reprieves to immigrants who came to the United States as children and have no legal authorization to live here, so-called ""Dreamers."" As of June 8, DACA was still in effect, and the Trump administration continued to take applications, prompting Coulter to tweet: ""HOW TRUMP LOSES THE NEXT ELECTION. Nearly 100,000 ‘Dreamers’ Granted Amnesty In Trump’s Opening Months."" HOW TRUMP LOSES THE NEXT ELECTION. Nearly 100,000 ‘Dreamers’ Granted Amnesty In Trump’s Opening Monthshttps://t.co/7wNN8RsJXd Her tweet linked to an article from conservative news outlet The Daily Caller, headlined ""Nearly 100,000 ‘Dreamers’ Granted Amnesty In Trump’s Opening Months"" — part of the text in Coulter’s tweet. We wondered if her tweet was accurate. We found that the numbers are in line with data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, but whether the program grants ""amnesty"" is a matter of debate among experts. About a month into Trump’s administration, Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly rescinded all previous enforcement priorities memos. But he kept in place a June 2012 memo that created DACA and a November 2014 memo for a separate deferred action program that would have benefitted immigrants in the country illegally who are parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.  On June 15, the Trump administration revoked the memo that benefitted the parents, but said DACA would remain in place. White House press secretary Sean Spicer on June 19 said DACA is under review but did not provide a timeline for a final determination.  Close to 800,000 immigrants have been approved for DACA, according to USCIS data released June 8. The latest numbers show approvals from 2012 up to March 31, 2017. From January 2017 to March 2017, immigration officials approved more than 124,000 applications: 107,524 renewal cases plus 17,275 initial cases. How many have been approved since Trump took office Jan. 20?  The Daily Caller, citing USCIS numbers, reported that the Trump administration through DACA had ""given amnesty to an estimated 98,000 illegal immigrants.""  We reached out to The Daily Caller’s reporter, Alex Pfeiffer, who told us he reached the estimated 98,000 by dividing the total number of cases approved from January through March by the number of business days in that period, and removing days in January that Trump was not in office. Pfeiffer said he only used business days in the calculation, because those are the only days that USCIS accepts DACA applications. USCIS told us DACA applications are not accepted online, only by mail, and that the lockbox where requests are sent typically accepts mail from Monday through Friday.  We did our own calculation using Pfeiffer’s parameters and also got about 98,000. We asked USCIS for a month-by-month breakdown of approved applications, but did not receive the information by deadline. Coulter did not respond to our inquiries sent via social media or her booking company. Whether DACA beneficiaries are getting amnesty is a not a settled matter among experts. We’ve noted before that a legal definition of amnesty is ""a blanket abolition of an offense by the government, with the legal result that those charged or convicted have the charge or conviction wiped out … Amnesty is not a pardon as some believe, since a pardon implies forgiveness, and amnesty indicates a reason to overlook or forget the offenses."" The common reference for amnesty in modern American politics is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, signed by President Ronald Reagan. The law paved the way for immigrants who were in the country illegally to become lawful permanent residents if they met certain requirements, including being in the country by Jan. 1, 1982. Individuals granted DACA are protected from deportation for two years and are eligible for work permits. Recipients can apply to renew their DACA protection, but are not granted a lawful status. DACA is a temporary and limited kind of relief that can be revoked by the president, said Kevin R. Johnson, an immigration law expert and dean of the University of California, Davis School of Law. ""DACA does not create a lasting ‘amnesty’ and lawful permanent residence"" as did the 1986 law, Johnson said. Others see it differently. Based on the benefits it offers, DACA is amnesty, said Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low-immigration levels. ""I would define an amnesty as such whenever the law is set aside and the normal penalty is waived as a matter of policy,"" Camarota said. ""The normal penalty for being in the U.S. illegally is removal."" In a tweet, Coulter said the Trump administration granted amnesty to ""Nearly 100,000 'Dreamers.' ""  Trump assumed office Jan. 20. Data from USCIS shows more than 124,000 people have been approved for DACA from January to March. Calculations of the total applications approved January through March that only include days Trump has been in office show that, at least, about 98,000 were approved. Whether the program is amnesty is subject to interpretation. For that reason, we rate Coulter’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/jun/21/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-trump-granted-amnesty-nearly-1000/

This is a statistic President Donald Trump also cited in his speech declaring the withdrawal, but we found that the study is based on an extreme model, and its results were presented in a misleading way. Bilirakis’ office directed us to Trump’s announcement to withdraw from the Paris accord, citing the same study. But when we asked NERA about it, the organization forwarded the same statement they put out following Trump’s speech. ""Use of results from this analysis as estimates of the impact of the Paris Agreement alone mischaracterizes the purpose of NERA’s analysis, which was to explore the challenges of achieving reductions from U.S. industrial sectors over a longer term,"" it states. ""Selective use of results from a single implementation scenario and a single year compounds the mischaracterization."" Here’s why plucking the 2.7 million-lost jobs talking point is a bad idea. The study predicts the potential impact of hypothetical U.S. regulatory action to meet the carbon emission goals pledged in Paris. It was produced in March 2017 and funded by the American Council for Capital Formation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, both vocal opponents of the agreement. The loss of 2.7 million jobs economy-wide by 2025 reported in the study is contingent on ""additional regulatory actions necessary to meet the Paris target."" But the Paris agreement does not require actions, as it was not binding, and the regulatory action mentioned has not been proposed. The study begins, then, with the assumption that regulation would expand beyond the electricity sector, which is where the Obama administration directed it. According to law professor Cary Coglianese, the director of the University of Pennsylvania Program on Regulation and author of Does Regulation Kill Jobs?, the study is a forecast based on an erroneous model. ""How accurate that forecast or any forecast will be depends upon how well the model matches reality and the world. The particular model used in that NERA analysis doesn’t match up with what I think most people would recognize as the reality of the economy,"" Coglianese said. According to Gary Yohe, a professor of economics and environmental studies at Wesleyan University who worked on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that received a share of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, the model does not accurately reflect government regulation or the energy industry’s reaction to market trends. ""They impose what they interpret as the effect of what the Unites States agreed to under the Paris accord,"" Yohe said, but ""they pick the least efficient way of doing it."" The hypothetical regulations they impose are inflexible, ruling out cap-and-trade or taxes and instead set strict regulations on specific sectors. The NERA researchers acknowledged the risk of their predictions. ""The findings contained in this report may contain projections based on current data and historical trends,"" the report states. ""Actual results could be impacted by future events that cannot be predicted or controlled, including, without limitation, changes in business strategies, the development of future products and services, changes in market and industry conditions, the outcome of contingencies, changes in management, and changes in law or regulations."" The development of future products and services, though, is precisely what the renewable energy industry is all about. But the study assumes the economy and technology will remain unchanged. ""There’s no inclusion in the analysis of the growth or development of renewable energy sources, for example,"" Coglianese said. ""And one thing we know about jobs, renewable energy sources tend to result in hiring of more people and more jobs than in other parts of the energy sector."" ""According to the U.S. Energy and Employment Report designed by the Energy Information Administration, over 373,000 Americans were employed in solar energy, while the coal industry employed about 160,000 and continued to shrink since 2012 due, in part, to competition by natural gas. So while the quote in the NERA study seems to conflate job loss with unemployment, it ignores the possibility of a changing job market in which jobs in the renewable energy industry replace jobs in the traditional fossil fuel industry that would face heavier regulation to comply with the agreement. Our ruling Bilirakis said that the Paris accord could cost the United States 2.7 million jobs by 2025, citing a NERA study that presented this projection. But the study is unreliable, using an extreme model that does not consider the possible benefits of carbon regulation and rules out investment, flexibility or technology that would lead to more jobs. And as NERA itself stated, the study was not designed as a cost-benefit analysis of the Paris accord. We rate this statement False.",/factchecks/2017/jun/21/gus-bilirakis/gus-bilirakis-cites-flawed-study-defend-us-wit/

Joy Reid mistakes size of Trump victory in Georgia district
","After Republican Karen Handel defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff in a closely watched special election for a House seat in suburban Atlanta, commentators in both parties began to spin the results furiously. One of them was Joy Reid, the liberal host of the MSNBC show AM Joy. On election night, not long after it became clear that Handel had won a narrow victory, Reid reassured her followers on Twitter, ""It’s GEORGIA. A Republican district in Georgia that Trump won by 20+ points. Let’s hang on to some perspective, folks."" It's GEORGIA. A Republican district in Georgia that Trump won by 20+ points. Let's hang on to some perspective, folks. https://t.co/zeis02pRPj Reid is right that the district is historically Republican; Republicans have held it for decades, most recently by Tom Price, whose elevation to Health and Human Services secretary by President Donald Trump prompted the special election in the first place. However, Trump didn’t win the district by more than 20 points — not by a long shot. (Reid did later tweet back to a follower who suggested that Trump won by a point or two, ""Ah ok. I could have that one wrong. Thanks!"") According to the forthcoming Almanac of American Politics 2018, Trump defeated Clinton in the district by 160,029 votes to 155,087, or a 48 percent to 47 percent margin. That’s roughly a 1 percentage-point margin. (Full disclosure: The author of this article is also the senior author of that book.) Another source of presidential results by congressional district, Daily Kos Elections, had a similar number, putting the Trump margin of victory at 1.5 percentage points. Like a number of other traditionally Republican suburban congressional districts across the country, Georgia’s 6th District moved toward the Democrats in the 2016 presidential election. Political analysts credited Clinton’s gains in such districts to demographic patterns in each of the candidates’ bases of support. Hillary Clinton tended to do better than Trump did among voters with high educational attainment, who are disproportionately numerous in suburban districts like Georgia’s 6th. In some such districts, Clinton won outright over Trump. These included Texas’ 23rd District, held by GOP Rep. Will Hurd, and no fewer than seven Republican-held House districts in California. Georgia’s 6th District didn’t quite give Clinton the victory, but Trump notched only a narrow win in the district. The 2016 presidential result in the district was far worse for the Republicans than in previous elections. In 2012, according to the Almanac of American Politics, Mitt Romney won the district, 61 percent to 37 percent, a 24 percentage-point margin. That margin is more along the lines of what Reid was talking about. But 2016 was a very different election year from 2012 in the district. Georgia’s 6th District had already moved substantially in the Democrats’ direction by last November. Clinton won some 40,000 more votes in the district than President Barack Obama did in 2012, while Trump won almost 27,000 votes fewer than Mitt Romney did in 2012. Worth noting: Even as Trump was faring poorly in the district, Price won his seat by a margin similar to what Reid tweeted. In 2016, Price, a longtime incumbent first elected in 2004, defeated his little-known Democratic opponent, 62 percent to 38 percent, a 24-point margin. Still, Reid was wrong in her initial tweet. (She did not respond to an inquiry by Twitter.) Our ruling Reid's original tweet said that in Georgia’s 6th district, ""Trump won by 20+ points."" Romney won by that wide a margin margin in 2012, and Price did, too, as recently as last November. But Trump was nowhere near as popular in the district as Reid’s tweet indicates. He won by a point or two -- far worse than Republican candidates have traditionally fared in the 6th. We rate the statement False. EDITOR'S NOTE, June 21, 12:55 p.m.: Shortly after this article was posted, a reader informed us that Reid had replied to a follower on Twitter that she may have gotten the statistic wrong. We have now included that in the article.",/factchecks/2017/jun/21/joy-reid/joy-ann-reid-mistakes-size-trump-victory-georgia-d/

Are tweets right that a 'pro-Putin Ukrainian' gave Scott Walker $1 million?
","An anti-Donald Trump Democratic strategist and fundraiser has attacked Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker by trying to tie him to Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a May 23, 2017 tweet that has been retweeted more than 6,500 times ties, Scott Dworkin said this: Docs: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker took $1 million from a pro-Putin Ukrainian businessman—last election cycle. It’s a bit of a drive-by attack. Dworkin and his group Dworkin, who goes by @funder on Twitter, is a senior advisor for the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, which was founded during the 2016 presidential campaign. He gained attention after the election by saying he was filing treason ""complaints"" against Trump and three other officials in connection with Russian interference in the election. PunditFact pointed out that only federal prosecutors, not ordinary citizens, can file criminal complaints alleging treason. Dworkin has continued hammering on Russia, telling the Washington Post two weeks after his Walker tweet: ""Anybody who says we shouldn’t look into Russia at this point is either in it or a traitor."" The Walker attack Dworkin’s attack pertains to Walker’s brief run for the 2016 Republican nomination and to a super PAC which, unlike a presidential candidate, can accept unlimited donations. When we asked for information to back up the claim, Dworkin referred us to a Federal Election Commission record showing that Access Industries Inc. of New York City made a $1 million contribution to Unintimidated PAC, a super PAC launched by longtime Walker advisers. (The super PAC, by the way, offered perks to $1 million donors, including: twice-a-year retreats, members-only briefings and conference calls, two private dinners with ""VIP special guests"" and a special ""executive board member"" pin.) Access Industries actually gave a total of $1.5 million to the super PAC, the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics told us, although $1.2 million of it was returned after Walker dropped out of the race. So, the $1 million figure in the tweet is accurate, except that the money was given to a super PAC supporting Walker, not to Walker or to his campaign. The rest of the attack is less on target. The company owner Access Industries is a New York-based industrial group whose holdings include Warner Music. It was founded by Leonard Blavatnik. According to Forbes, he’s worth $19 billion, having made $7 billion from the sale of TNK-BP, a Russian oil company, in 2013. Blavatnik was born in Ukraine and raised in Moscow. But he emigrated to the United States for school in 1978, now lives in London and holds dual citizenship in the United States and the United Kingdom. So, calling him a Ukrainian businessman is not accurate. As for whether Blavatnik is ""pro-Putin,"" we didn’t find direct evidence of that, although there are connections. The Financial Times referred to Blavatnik as one of the ""Kremlin-friendly tycoons"" who made a fortune on the sale. In 2015, the London-based Daily Mail reported on controversy over a $75 million donation made by Blavatnik to Oxford University. Academics, human rights activists and Russian dissidents called on the university to ""stop selling its reputation and prestige to Putin’s associates."" And in 2016, the Daily Mail reported that British Prime Minister Theresa May believed that Russian and former Soviet bloc oligarchs with links to Putin had become too close to the Tories and should be barred from party fundraising events. The article cited Blavatnik as one of the oligarchs. However, when we checked with Steven Lee Myers, Karen Dawisha and Anne Garrels, each of whom has written a book on Putin, they told us they didn’t know whether Blavatnik was ""pro-Putin."" Blavatnik has pushed back on being tied to Putin. In May 2017, The Guardian reported that lawyers for Blavatnik have denied he is an associate of Putin, saying he has had no personal contact with the Russian president since 2000. Similarly, the Telegraph has reported that Blavatnik insists he's a strong believer in democracy who hasn't had any contact with Putin since 2000. Our rating Tweets made this claim: ""Docs: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker took $1 million from a pro-Putin Ukrainian businessman — last election cycle.""

The businessman was born in Ukraine, but has long lived in London and New York. His company gave $1.5 million not directly to Walker, but to a super PAC that supported Walker’s run for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. He has ties to Putin, based on his past ownership of a Russian oil company, but whether he is ""pro-Putin"" is unclear. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/jun/21/tweets/pro-putin-ukrainian-gave-scott-walker-1-million/

Here's every time Russian or Soviet spies tried to interfere in US elections. How does 2016 compare?
","Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, is leading a congressional investigation into the Russian intervention to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. And he says this scandal isn’t unique to Trump. ""This is not the first time they’ve been involved in our elections,"" Burr said earlier this month. Burr is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which recently has hosted public, under-oath testimony of some of the Trump administration’s top officials regarding Russian election meddling. Trump, for his part, has repeatedly called allegations of Russian meddling a fictional ""witch-hunt"" against him, and Russian President Vladimir Putin also denies any interference. Yet the U.S. intelligence community says the Russian government did try to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Independent observers agree, as do members of Congress including Burr. In a claim we fact-checked previously, Burr said his committee’s investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia has led to more transparency than usual. We rated that True. Now, we turn our attention to this claim that last year’s meddling wasn’t anything new. Here’s the full context. A reporter asked Burr what his reaction was to Putin's denial of Russian election meddling. Burr responded: ""That there is no truth to Vladimir Putin’s words. That by every judgment to this point, they were aggressively involved in the U.S. elections, Montenegro, France, they are involved in the German upcoming elections. And that this is not the first time they’ve been involved in our elections, and that America needs to have a much more definitive response to them."" Most of what Burr mentioned has been widely covered already. But not the last part. So we started digging. Close but no cigar Historians agree that what Burr said probably isn’t literally true. This is the first time (at least as far as the public knows) that Russia attempted to influence a U.S. election in favor of a particular candidate. However, it is a throwback of sorts to the Cold War. ""If by ‘they,’ he meant the Russians, he's incorrect,"" said Mark Kramer, an expert on foreign relations at Harvard University. ""But if he meant the Soviet Union, then it is certainly true."" And of course, there might be more out there that’s still classified or hasn’t yet been discovered. ""Now who knows if Russia didn’t somehow fund one candidate or another,"" said Frank Costigliola, a history professor at the University of Connecticut. ""But it’s unknown."" We asked six historians and foreign relations scholars to consider Burr’s claim. Two said they had no idea what he was talking about. The others pointed to a handful of documented (yet relatively unknown) meddling efforts by Soviet leaders. None could identify any Russian meddling attempts. We also asked Burr what he meant. His office pointed us to an intelligence report, published in January, that concluded the Kremlin tried to help Trump and hurt his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Spy games That report is ""a declassified version of a highly classified assessment"" made using CIA, FBI and NSA intelligence. It said the 2016 Russian meddling was the ""boldest yet"" in a U.S. election. It said with ""high confidence"" that Russia was behind the hack and publication of embarrassing emails from the Democratic National Committee, that it hacked into U.S. voting software, and that the Kremlin funded a large pro-Trump, anti-Clinton campaign in the United States using paid social media ""trolls"" as well as more traditional propaganda outlets. The report didn’t completely back up Burr’s claim. It said the Russians have spied on U.S. presidential candidates before, and have used state-owned propaganda outlets like RT and RT America to cast doubts on the U.S. democratic process. But it listed no previous attempts to actually influence the outcome of an election. In fact, the report said the 2016 meddling ""demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations."" And while this report made only vague references to Soviet meddling, our interviews uncovered a few instances of Cold War-era attempts to either boost one candidate or harm another. Over the course of 11 presidential elections between the end of World War II and the fall of the Soviet Union, we identified three secret attempts to influence an election. • 1960: Through his ambassador to the United States, Mikhail Menshikov, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev offered Adlai Stevenson help from a secret propaganda campaign. However, Stevenson declined the offer. He lost in the Democratic primary to John F. Kennedy. • 1968: The Soviet Union’s ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Dobrynin, offered to secretly fund Hubert Humphrey’s campaign against Richard Nixon. Humphrey declined the bribe. • 1976: Fearing that anti-communist Democrat Henry ""Scoop"" Jackson stood a good chance at winning in the wake of Nixon’s resignation, the KGB began a smear campaign. Soviet spies forged FBI paperwork to make it appear Jackson was secretly gay and sent the fake reports to newspapers around the United States during the election and for years after. Notably, the past attempts to help a candidate were arranged through the ambassador. And much of the investigation into last year has focused on meetings the current Russian ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, had with key officials on Trump’s team before Trump became president. Some of those meetings allegedly involved former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn (who in 2015 took $45,000 from RT), Attorney General Jeff Sessions (who was a top Trump advisor during the campaign) and Jared Kushner, Trump’s senior advisor and son-in-law. Our ruling Burr said that when it comes to Russian spies, ""this is not the first time they’ve been involved in our elections."" There’s no public evidence the post-Cold War Russian government has ever meddled at anywhere near the levels of 2016, when U.S. officials say the Kremlin tried to help Trump’s campaign. However, during the Cold War there were a few Soviet attempts to hurt or help specific candidates. Yet 2016 was the first time in 40 years the United States is known to have seen this type of interference. Since Burr’s claim has some truth to it but gives an impression that’s slightly misleading, we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2017/jun/20/richard-burr/heres-every-time-russian-or-soviet-spies-tried-int/

Trump is right: Ossoff does not live in Georgia's 6th Congressional District
","Unless President Donald Trump pre-schedules his tweets, we know what he was doing as the sun rose in Washington -- tweeting a warning to voters in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District on the day of the most expensive House election ever.

Trump’s false claim that 'Dems want billions to go to Insurance Companies to bail out donors'
","President Donald Trump has claimed the reason Democratic lawmakers support the Affordable Care Act is to reward their political patrons in the health insurance industry. ""Dems want billions to go to Insurance Companies to bail out donors,"" Trump said in an April 30 Tweet. Trump’s remarks come as Republicans in Congress attempt to undo and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as the ACA or Obamacare. Trump’s reference to a ""bail out,"" according to experts, reflects a longstanding Republican epithet for Obamacare subsidies paid to insurers participating in government-run marketplaces. In fact, in recent remarks, Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, appeared to use the term ""bailout"" synonymously with cost-sharing reduction subsidies, or CSRs. ""There’s absolutely no language in this bill that requires us to make any Obamacare bailout payments, any CSR payments of any way, shape or form as a result of this deal, okay?"" Mulvaney said in a May 2 budget briefing with reporters. Trump’s comment raises several questions we’ve decided to investigate. To what extent are health insurance companies Democratic donors? Do Democrats in fact want billions to go to these companies? And do Obamacare subsidies amount to a kickback from Democrats to health insurers? Are health insurance companies Democratic donors? Strictly speaking, health insurance companies do give to both parties. Several experts told us the industry views this as a strategic hedge. ""Insurers largely balance their political donations to reflect whichever political party is more (or less) in power, because their primary objective is to ‘stay in business’ pragmatically under the best terms available,"" said Thomas Miller, an American Enterprise Institute fellow. ""It's more a matter of the price of doing (political) business than any consistent ideological commitment in either direction."" But explicitly calling insurance companies Democratic donors, as Trump did, gives the impression the industry has a clear partisan bias toward Democrats. Is that the case? According to recent political spending, the opposite is true. Significantly more industry money has flowed to Republicans than Democrats over roughly the past decade. In fact, from the period starting in 2007 just before the Obamacare debate began in earnest through the first years of its implementation, financial data suggests insurers tried to undermine Democrats as they sought to reform the health care system. From 2007 through August 2012, the 11 largest health insurance companies and their biggest trade group gave $10.2 million to federal politicians, with two-thirds going to Republicans who opposed Obamacare or supported its repeal, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Over the past five election cycles, the two biggest health insurance associations have given significantly more to Republicans than Democrats, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in U.S. politics. Since 2008, the National Association of Health Underwriters PAC gave $2.4 million to Republicans and $899,600 to Democrats, while America's Health Insurance Plans PAC gave $637,500 to Republicans and $563,700 to Democrats. Political donations over this same period by the insurance industry as a whole also favors Republicans, who’ve received $158 million compared to $96 million to Democrats, though this particular data is only modestly helpful, because it also includes companies that provide property, life and car insurance. Sherry Glied, dean of NYU's Graduate School of Public Service, said ever since Democrats came under fire for health care reform efforts in the 1990s, they’ve been more concerned with provoking the industry’s ire than receiving its largesse. ""Most Democrats are mainly concerned about anti-reform lobbying by insurers, not pro-reform contributions,"" she said. So Trump’s attempt to paint Democrats as industry clients grossly distorts reality. Do Democrats want billions to go to insurance companies? Again, strictly speaking, Democrats do want billions to go to health insurance companies -- but not for the reason Trump claims. Obamacare does in fact contain mechanisms designed to transfer federal money -- indeed, billions of dollars per year -- to insurance companies. The government set up the system this way to tackle a complex challenge: how to make a health insurance marketplace that's affordable for lower-income people buying insurance on their own, as well as providing stability for insurance companies facing the uncertainty of a newly-regulated market that makes insurers cover people with pre-existing conditions. ""The entire structure (was designed) to create an individual insurance market that could serve a population that included sick people as well as healthy people,"" said Paul Ginsburg, University of Southern California professor of the practice of health policy and management. This structure is expensive to maintain. Practically speaking, Obamacare will transfer an estimated $49 billion in federal money to private insurance companies this year, and another $63 billion in 2018, according to the CBO. The bulk of 2017 funding -- $38 billion -- goes to lowering premiums for lower-income Americans who buy their own insurance. The remaining $11 billion will reduce deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses, while helping to stabilize the individual market. So given that Obamacare subsidies are an essential part of a reformed health care system that has seen an estimated 20 million people gain coverage, there’s an element of truth to Trump’s claim that Democrats want billions to go to health insurance companies. Do Obamacare subsidies amount to kickback from Democrats to health insurers? So what to make of Trump’s insinuation that Obamacare subsidies amount to a venal quid-pro-quo, a kind of kickback from Democrats to their health insurance patrons? Several experts we talked to said this claim essentially turns the Affordable Care Act on its head. ""These transfers relate to specific ways the ACA was designed to subsidize low income consumers and provide market stability in the first few years,"" said Katherine Hempstead, Senior Advisor at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. ""I have never heard of any relationship between these components of the ACA and any kind of political donations."" Paul Ginsburg, University of Southern California professor of the practice of health policy and management, said Trump’s tweet echoed a familiar attack line by Obamacare critics. ""The notion that these payments to insurers reflect campaign contributions strikes me as absurd and a continuation of attempts to undermine the ACA by attacking payments to insurers,"" Ginsburg said. Other experts found Trump’s explanation of Democrats’ support for Obamacare risible. ""It is absurd to say that Democrats support premium tax credits or cost sharing reductions to reward donors,"" said Timothy Jost, a health care policy expert at Washington & Lee law school. ""The money is to cover low-income Americans who are not big political donors."" The argument that Obamacare is a giveaway to insurers is undermined by provisions Democrats placed in the law to specifically limit corporate profits and subject insurance companies to financial scrutiny, said Glied of NYU's Graduate School of Public Service. An Obamacare regulation known as the 80-20 Rule, for example, stipulates that under certain plans, for every $1 an insurance company takes in from premiums, at least $0.80 has to be spent on health care. In other words, the maximum profits a company could make under this rule is 20 percent of the revenue it collects from premiums. This scenario describes a company with a so-called medical loss ratio, or MLR, of 80 percent -- the amount being paid out for health care. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, it’s unlikely insurers can be profitable when MLRs exceed 85-90 percent. That matters because if subsidies given to insurance companies participating in Obamacare exchanges were supposed to be a kickback, as Trump claims, the kickback hasn’t worked very well in recent years. ""Many companies participating in the individual market – where most of the major market reforms took place in 2014 – experienced substantial losses in this market in the early years of reform,"" according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.  Instead of viewing Democrats and insurers as being engaged in a corrupt quid pro quo, some experts we talked to suggested a softer kind of symbiosis is at play. ""The better explanation is that Democrats and insurers needed each other,"" said Miller of the American Enterprise Institute. ""The ACA could not work tolerably without the active involvement, and adequate profitability, of private insurers. Both sides reached short term accommodations, even though their longer term interests were not fully parallel in all respects."" Glied of NYU's Graduate School of Public Service expressed a similar view. ""I think the Democrats are well aware that they need the cooperation of the industry to make the plan work, since the plan does rely on private insurance,"" she said. ""They need the cost-sharing reductions because otherwise the industry is not going to participate in the market and people won't have any coverage."" ""That's not pandering,"" Glied added, ""it's common sense."" Our ruling Trump said, ""Dems want billions to go to Insurance Companies to bail out donors."" Democrats do want billions to go to health insurance companies -- but not for the reason Trump claims. Their cooperation has been essential to the functioning of the health care system set up by the Affordable Care Act. Trump’s suggestion that Democrats are engaged in a corrupt quid pro quo involving Obamacare subsidies in exchange for campaign contributions is patently absurd, health care experts said, particularly given that industry donations over the past decade show a clear bias in favor of Republicans.

Sonny Perdue changes school lunch rules, but says Obama standards for milk, grains remain
","Agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue went to an elementary school lunchroom in Virginia to announce new rules for the food schools serve. Under the banner of trimming the childhood obesity rate, combatting rising levels of diabetes and other health problems, Congress passed and the Obama administration implemented new targets for schools. Perdue gave schools more time to comply in two areas -- whole grains and sodium levels -- and expanded the rules for milk. ""We're giving these food service professionals the flexibility to move as we get a healthier generation,"" Perdue said May 1. ""This is not reducing nutritional standards whatsoever. It's pausing here to evaluate whether or not the progressive standards of moving even further are appropriate or not."" Perdue argued that if kids don’t like what they’re offered, they simply won’t eat it, and giving schools more time to comply would help children get more of the nutrition they need. We focus here on Perdue’s claim that his move does not reduce nutritional standards. Is it true that they do no reduce nutritional standards set by the department in 2012 ""whatsoever?"" While Perdue is technically correct about not reducing the standards, his department will not be enforcing them.  ""He is not changing the standards per se, but he is allowing schools to not follow them,"" said nutrition policy researcher David Pelletier at Cornell University. ""It’s a bit like saying the posted speed limits on the roads remain the same, but you can go as fast as you want."" The starting point Washington’s school lunch program reaches about 30 million kids every day at a yearly cost of about $11 billion. To qualify for federal support, schools must meet a number of dietary regulations. In 2012, the Agriculture Department announced the final version of Nutrition Standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. For milk, schools could provide ""flavor in fat-free milk only."" By 2015, all grain products, such as bread, oatmeal and noodles had to be ""whole grain-rich."" That term meant that at least half was whole grain and the rest could be processed but enriched with vitamins and minerals. The rule for reducing sodium, or salt, was more complicated and set increasingly lower targets that varied slightly by age group. So for example, by July 2014, a lunch for an elementary student couldn’t contain more than 1,230 mg of sodium, which is about 65 percent of the upper limit for a full day as set in the Federal Dietary Guidelines. By July 2017, the target became 50 percent of the daily limit, and by July 2022, the target went down to about 33 percent. Making 'school meals great again' Perdue’s office sent out a press release entitled ""Ag Secretary Perdue Moves to Make School Meals Great Again."" It said the department would start the process to allow schools to start serving 1 percent flavored milk. At the elementary school event, Perdue said, ""I wouldn't be as big as I am today without chocolate milk."" For grains, schools could apply for exemptions to the whole grain-rich content rule through 2020. On sodium, any school meeting the first target for lunches of about 65 percent of the daily limit would be considered in compliance through 2020. In a statement, the department said this was similar to a 2016 memo from the Obama Agriculture Department. That memo said it recognized that manufacturers had lagged in cutting down the salt in food, and so schools ""that are working toward compliance"" would not suffer if they hadn’t yet made the grade. Perdue’s policy is more lenient, declaring that no school need push beyond the first target while, as Perdue said, the department pauses ""to evaluate whether or not the progressive standards of moving even further are appropriate or not."" Were nutrition standards reduced? For whole grains and sodium, the new policy extends the timeline for achieving those standards, but so far, the overall goals remain -- with the option to reassess later. Pelletier of Cornell and nutrition policy researcher Joann Slavin at the University of Minnesota both said the underlying nutrition standards are unchanged.  But Pelletier called Perdue's statement a ""semantic trick."" The situation with milk is a little trickier. The 2012 rules, which match the recommendations from a 2009 National Academy of Sciences panel, said flavored milk had to be non-fat. Perdue hasn’t officially changed that yet, but he said ""USDA will seek to publish an interim rule as soon as possible to effect the change in milk policy,"" to allow flavored 1 percent milk. Slavin said the federal rules on milk went too far. That said, they were published as nutritional standards and followed the guidance from an independent research group. Our ruling Perdue said his changes to the school lunch requirements did not reduce nutritional standards. The plain facts and the assessment of experts confirm that the long term goals for whole grains and sodium remain in place for now. However, under the new policy, schools need not make more progress toward those goals for another three years. In addition, the current standards don’t allow flavored 1 percent milk, and the new policy states that the department wants to change that through an interim rule. So the standards might not have changed yet, but Perdue said he plans to do so.

Did bankrupt Trump golf course in Puerto Rico leave taxpayers on the hook?
","President Donald Trump accused Democrats of using Puerto Rico’s debt as a bargaining chip before the deadline to settle the federal budget. ""The Democrats want to shut government if we don't bail out Puerto Rico and give billions to their insurance companies for OCare failure. NO!"" Trump tweeted April 27. The Democrats want to shut government if we don't bail out Puerto Rico and give billions to their insurance companies for OCare failure. NO! Trump appeared to be referring to an effort by Democrats including Florida Sen. Bill Nelson to address a Medicaid shortfall in Puerto Rico, which became the largest municipal bankruptcy May 3. The Florida Democratic Party fired back at Trump’s tweet in a press release suggesting that Trump shares blame in the island’s economic downfall. A Trump golf resort, the party said, crashed in Puerto Rico and hurt taxpayers. ""Trump conveniently left out the fact that his golf course on the island defaulted, like so many of his other failed business schemes. The failure left Puerto Rican taxpayers with a nearly $33 million bill, another example of Trump's many scams that make him wealthier and con hardworking families,"" the party wrote. Did Trump really leave the island with a bungled investment? We found that the bankruptcy of the golf resort did leave taxpayers with a bill, and that Trump had pledged to turn things around. But the Democrats portrayed the situation in a misleading light by omitting that the business was in dire financial straits years before Trump entered the picture. The Trump family has tried to create space in the years since between the resort and their business. Golf resort’s pre-Trump financial woes The resort in Rio Grande opened as Coco Beach Golf & Country Club in 2004 and ultimately included two 18-hole golf courses and a clubhouse. Trump entered the picture in 2008. The resort was built with support from the Puerto Rican government through the Puerto Rico Tourism Development Fund. The fund issued about $25 million in bonds in 2000 and 2004, according to a 2016 BuzzFeed article that included documents about the golf resort’s bankruptcy. The tourism development fund is paid for by tax dollars. If a private entity defaults on its obligations -- as the golf resort did in this case -- the fund has to make good on the principal and interest. The resort suffered amid the recession that hit Puerto Rico a few years before Trump got involved. To learn more about what went wrong, we interviewed Craig McCann, a principal at Securities Litigation and Consulting Group, who has testified several times in arbitrations about Puerto Rican municipal bonds but has had no role in this particular case. McCann was a key source for the BuzzFeed article, and his firm reviewed annual financial reports that were included. The recession in Puerto Rico was much worse than the mainland and started earlier as manufacturers left in 2006-07 due to the elimination of a tax subsidy for manufacturers, McCann told PolitiFact. Then the island got a second financial hit, this time rattled by the recession in the United States. The resort lost about $5.7 million in 2007 and $6.3 million in 2008. ""This resort just got hammered and is hemorrhaging money before the Trump Organization’s involvement,"" McCann told PolitiFact. As the losses piled up, property owners went looking for help. Enter Trump. Problems continued under Trump In 2008, Trump signed two deals: a licensing agreement to rename the club as Trump International Golf Club Puerto Rico, and a management agreement to position Trump to handle the club’s operations in exchange for a share of its annual revenue and a slice of the profit. A document stated that as manager, Trump International Co had developed a plan to maintain positive operating cash flow. Trump claimed more than $600,000 in profits by the end of 2012. ""Puerto Rico is a fantastic place and deserves the best, which is what we will deliver,"" Trump said at a 2008 news conference on the island, according to the Washington Post. ""Every detail will be important to me."" It isn’t clear from the documents how involved Trump really was. It is clear, however, that he didn’t solve the resort’s problems. There was at least one bright spot as the resort racked up losses: The course landed on the PGA tour in 2008. But in 2011, the resort sought more bonds to repay the earlier bonds. McCann said that even if Trump had not gotten involved, the resort was headed toward bankruptcy because the 2000 and 2004 bonds were about to default. In 2015, the resort filed for bankruptcy under its original name, the Coco Beach Golf and Country Club. The resort claimed it owed more than $78 million but only had $9 million in assets. Johanna Cervone, spokeswoman for the Democrats, says Trump was brought in to save the golf course but left taxpayers on the hook. ""He was tasked with turning it around, he made revenue off of it, and it failed,"" she said. Eric Trump distanced his father from the project when it fell into bankruptcy ""We have zero financial investment in this course,"" Eric Trump told Bloomberg News in July 2015. ""This has absolutely nothing to do with Trump. This is a separate owner. We purely manage the golf course."" (Eric Trump filed a bankruptcy claim for about $927,000 for unpaid fees on behalf of Trump Golf Coco Beach LLC.) Bankruptcy court records show that the Puerto Rico Tourism Development Fund, the largest creditor, filed a claim for $32.67 million for the real estate mortgage in 2015. The resort later sold for about $2 million to OHorizons Global, a private investment firm. This left the Government Development Bank -- the tourism fund is a subsidiary of the bank -- to make payments on the outstanding bonds. We sent a summary of the golf course’s financial problems to a few experts and asked if Trump should be blamed for the bankruptcy. (These experts on bankruptcy or corporate law received our summary with links to news reports but didn’t pore over financial records for days, as McCann’s firm did.) John A. E. Pottow, a University of Michigan law professor and bankruptcy expert, said Trump bears some blame for the failure of the golf course because he failed to turn it around. But he said it is debatable if management is to blame for bankruptcy because the context of the recession is a factor. ""I don't know if I like to ‘blame’ anyone for bankruptcy, but to the extent you want to blame people, sure, blame the president (or his company),"" Pottow said. Miami attorney Milton Vescovacci, of Gray Robinson law firm, says the only way to blame Trump for the bankruptcy would be if his involvement was so costly to the operation that it caused the business to fail, and that didn’t appear to be the case here. (Vescovacci is an expert on banking and finance and is currently working with an organization to lobby the U.S. government to allow Puerto Rico to restructure its debt) The golf course bankruptcy is different from bankruptcies of multiple Trump casinos, McCann said. With the casinos, Trump was a major investor and had a significant role such as controlling shareholder or as an executive. In Puerto Rico, he said, ""The Trump Organization was providing services and a brand all for a fee. No equity interest. No deep involvement."" The Trump Organization sent PolitiFact a statement: ""The Trump Organization was neither the owner nor the developer of this property and had nothing to do with the financing of the development. Our role was to operate and manage the property."" Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said that Trump’s ""golf course on the island defaulted, like so many of his other failed business schemes. The failure left Puerto Rican taxpayers with a nearly $33 million bill."" Trump entered into a licensing and management agreement in 2008 -- after the golf course resort had fallen into debt. Trump failed to turn around the resort and it declared bankruptcy in 2015. The Puerto Rico Tourism Development Fund, which provided project financing in 2000 and 2004, filed a claim in bankruptcy court for $32.7 million. The fund is paid for with tax dollars. The Democratic Party is correct that taxpayers are left with a nearly $33 million bill, but it exaggerates when it points the finger exclusively at Trump, omitting important details about the recession’s impact on the resort and its financial woes years before Trump’s involvement.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Paul Ryan']","
Did Paul Ryan flip-flop on how to pass a big health care bill?
","As legislation to dramatically overhaul the Affordable Care Act neared a vote in the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives, critics said that Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., was hypocritical in how he brought a revised bill to the floor. In March, a bill known as the American Health Care Act was pulled from the floor by GOP leaders because it didn’t have enough votes to pass. That was considered a major defeat for both congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump, who had campaigned on the repeal and replacement of President Barack Obama’s far-reaching health care law. Republican leaders adjusted the bill following negotiations with both the conservative and moderate wings of the party. A new version passed the House on May 4 by a 217-213 vote margin. In addition to decrying the substance of the bill, Democrats and other critics took House Republicans to task for seeming to ram the bill through the chamber without adequate procedural safeguards. One concern was that the full text of the revised bill and the relevant amendments was only posted on the Web on the evening of May 3, less than 24 hours before the House was scheduled to vote on it. Another concern was that the Congressional Budget Office -- the nonpartisan office that analyzes the impact of pending legislation -- had not reviewed the new version of the bill. The CBO had reviewed the original bill, and in doing so, it found that the measure would lead to an additional 24 million Americans being uninsured by 2026, compared to the number who would be uninsured if the current law was still in force. Critics said Ryan and House Republicans were hypocritical for voting on a new version without a new CBO score, and they pointed to Ryan’s past comments as evidence. On June 23, 2009, Ryan signed on to a letter to the then-director of CBO seeking a wide-ranging analysis of the Affordable Care Act, which then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was trying to pass. ""We are writing to respectfully request that you analyze the House Democrat bill as expeditiously as possible. ... Before Congress changes health care as the American people know it, we must know the likely consequences of the House Democrat legislation, including the number of people who would lose access to their current insurance, the number of jobs lost due to business taxes, the number of uninsured people who would obtain coverage, and the extent of the cannibalization of employer coverage due to Medicaid expansion."" Then, in an appearance on MSNBC in July 2009, Ryan personally criticized the Democrats’ procedural handling of the bill in the House. ""I don't think we should pass bills that we haven't read, that we don't know what they cost,"" Ryan said. We wondered whether Ryan’s past remarks and current actions amounted to a flip-flop, so we sought advice from a range of congressional experts and veterans of House floor action. Generally, we found a sharp partisan divide between those who thought Ryan’s actions in shepherding the health care bill were appropriate and those who did not. But we also found some agreement that members of both parties tend to speak and act differently depending on who’s in the majority and who’s in the minority -- and a measure of agreement that Ryan did not meet the spirit of his 2009 comments in 2017. Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staffer on the Rules Committee who now studies Congress at the Woodrow Wilson Center said the bill did not require a new CBO score, since its previous iteration had already been analyzed by the agency. ""CBO is not obliged to score amendments adopted subsequent to a bill's being reported,"" Wolfensberger said. Wolfensberger added that CBO is expected to do a new analysis of the bill eventually -- but that it would happen after passage. Ryan could have waited for a new CBO analysis before calling for the vote, but it was within his discretion to go forward without a new score. Several Republicans with House floor experience said they have no quarrel with how Ryan has handled the bill. ""It is well established that when you are in the minority, you complain about procedure, and when you are in the majority, you complain about partisanship,"" said John Feehery, a former aide to then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ""Nothing about Ryan's comment strikes me as unusual or otherwise inappropriate."" Glenn LeMunyon, a former floor specialist to then-House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, agreed. ""The opposing side on any legislative matter will always try to make that case, and the media will try to exploit it,"" he said. ""But the truth is that this is very normal procedure. They have taken legislation and crafted it (with additional amendments) in order to gain enough support to pass."" LeMunyon said the revised Republican bill ""is not some new incarnation of health care policy. It is very similar to that which has been in the works for many months. This is not a situation where cost estimates are a complete unknown at all. Leadership has a very good idea of what it would score and so do all the members, regardless of the complaints coming from the opposition."" But congressional experts more aligned with Ryan’s critics say his earlier remarks and his present actions are at odds. Former Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas -- a longtime member of the House Rules Committee -- said Ryan’s positions are inconsistent. ""I don’t remember examples of proceeding without a CBO score,"" Frost told PolitiFact. When asked to consider the argument that the three amendments are simply minor tweaks that don’t merit a separate CBO score, he responded, ""Nothing is minor in this bill."" And Norm Ornstein, a longtime follower of congressional procedure who has been critical of Republicans from his perch at the American Enterprise Institute, said that ""of course"" Ryan’s past comments conflict with his recent actions. ""This is a giant leap in hypocrisy,"" he said. Ornstein seconded Frost’s assessment that voting on a bill this far-reaching without a revised CBO score is essentially unheard of. Meanwhile, several of the experts we contacted agreed that situational procedural ethics are rampant in both parties. Pelosi herself faced similar complaints when she was trying to get the ACA passed early in Obama’s tenure. In particular, she was pilloried by Republicans when she told an audience prior to passage, ""We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of the controversy."" A Pelosi spokesman said at the time that her words were taken out of context. ""She meant there was so much talk about process (in Congress) that people have lost sight of what’s actually in the bill,"" the spokesman said. ""Once it’s passed, we can remind them of all the good things that are in it."" In addition, those sympathetic to Pelosi have said that the House passage of the ACA was done over a much longer period and included more public hearings. The CBO analyzed the ACA or parts of it on more than two dozen occasions in 2009 and 2010. Still, the perception that Pelosi unfairly strong-armed the ACA to passage while ignoring longstanding procedures has helped shape the perception of Ryan’s actions today. ""We have been around long enough to know about pots calling kettles black, and shoes being on the other foot,"" Wolfensberger said. ""Neither party has a monopoly on procedural abuses, shenanigans and shortcuts. This is the new normal, and has been for the last few decades -- not deliberative democracy."" In other words, the contrast between Ryan’s words in 2009 and his actions in 2017 are par for the course in Congress in recent years. But while Ryan was within his rights to handle the Republican health care bill as he did, his 2009 comments raised the procedural bar in a way that his actions in 2017 did not meet.

Does new version of the AHCA protect coverage for pre-existing conditions?
","One of the key sticking points over U.S. House Republicans’ plan to repeal and replace Obamacare is what will happen to people with pre-existing health conditions if this new plan passes. North Carolina Republican Rep. Robert Pittenger supports the bill. He said Tuesday that people still would be able to buy health insurance even if they already have cancer, heart disease, diabetes or some other type of health issue. One of the biggest changes in the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, was a requirement that insurers cannot reject people on the basis of pre-existing conditions or charge them exorbitant rates for their premiums. ""The American Health Care Act absolutely does not eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions,"" Pittenger said. However, that is misleading. It’s an issue that affects many people, too. According to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, more than one in four Americans between 18 and 64 has a pre-existing condition – including more than 1.6 million people in Pittenger’s state of North Carolina. Of those, 86,000 North Carolinians with pre-existing conditions buy their insurance through the Obamacare marketplace, according to Avalere, a Washington, D.C, health care consulting company – as do nearly 2.3 million people nationwide. President Donald Trump made a similar claim to Pittenger’s, saying on April 30 that ""pre-existing conditions are in the bill."" PolitiFact rated that Mostly False. Pittenger made his claim two days later. However, nothing changed in that time regarding the AHCA’s proposed rules for protecting people with pre-existing conditions. So Pittenger’s claim misses the mark, too. Weakening current protections The AHCA does keep the requirement that people with pre-existing conditions must be offered health insurance. But it would drop Obamacare’s rules capping how much extra those people can be charged. The part of the AHCA dealing with pre-existing conditions is the MacArthur Amendment, named after Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey. (See PolitiFact’s full analysis of the amendment here.) Compare two of the amendment’s key provisions:   So it appears people wouldn’t pay wildly different rates due only to their gender, which is also the case under Obamacare. But by contrast, insurers would only have to provide access to coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. It says nothing about the rates of that coverage. That means if the AHCA passes, it would allow for people with pre-existing conditions to be charged more per year for their insurance coverage – possibly to the tune of thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars more per year, some studies have found. The exact amount might differ regionally, since some states might not allow the higher rates. Pittenger said that if the AHCA passes and people want better health insurance, they could move to a different state. How the changes work Matt Fiedler, a health care analyst for the Brookings Institute, said the AHCA would force people with a pre-existing condition to choose between two different pools of insurance coverage, both with ""a very high premium."" ""In either case, people with serious health conditions would lack access to affordable insurance options,"" he said. The AARP opposes the AHCA for that reason. So does the nation’s largest group of doctors, the American Medical Association, which said the AHCA will do ""serious harm to patients and the health care delivery system."" Upton amendment and high-risk pools For people with pre-existing conditions, states could allow insurers to charge more if they set up a high-risk pool or participate in a new federal invisible risk-sharing program. Medical professionals question the quality of care those pools would provide. ""The history of high-risk pools demonstrates that Americans with pre-existing conditions will be stuck in second-class health care coverage – if they are able to obtain coverage at all,"" said Dr. Andrew Gurman, president of the American Medical Association. Ten groups that advocate for patients – including the American Cancer Society and American Heart Association – also issued a joint statement in opposition. They said in the past, high-risk pools ""resulted in higher premiums, long waiting lists and inadequate coverage."" One of Pittenger’s fellow Republicans, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, initially said the AHCA ""torpedoes"" pre-existing condition protections. But Upton changed his mind Wednesday after House leadership set aside an extra $8 billion, spread over five years, to subsidize people whose premiums skyrocket. However, there's disagreement as to whether the money is enough. And it’s not clear who would be eligible to receive subsidies, how much they could receive or how much they would be required to pay on their own. Our ruling Pittenger said that the Republican AHCA health care plan ""does not eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions."" While insurers technically would still be required to offer coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, the AHCA would weaken protections for those people. Insurers would be able to charge people significantly more if they had a pre-existing condition like heart disease, cancer, diabetes or arthritis – possibly requiring people to pay thousands of dollars extra every year to remain insured.

Ivanka Trump, in new book, says women are primary earners in 40% of households
","Despite the large number of women in the American workforce, society still treats them as an ""anomaly,"" first daughter Ivanka Trump wrote in the introduction to her new book, Women Who Work. ""Forty-seven percent of the U.S. workforce is made up of women; 70 percent of all mothers support ourselves or contribute financially to our family’s bottom line; and 40 percent of American households have female primary breadwinners,"" Trump wrote. ""Yet we still say ‘working woman’ as if she were an anomaly. We never say ‘working man.’ "" There are a few statistics in that passage, but we wanted to hone in on one of them: that women are the primary earners in 40 percent of American households. In the notes section of her book, Trump referenced a widely cited 2013 Pew Research Center report that looked at households with children under the age of 18.  The report found that in 2011, women earned most or all of the family’s income in 40 percent of these households, adding up to about 13.7 million ""breadwinner moms."" That’s quadruple what it was in 1960 — 11 percent. The Pew figure is a little more specific than what Trump wrote because it only looked at households that had kids, not those that don't have kids. But in context, it's clear Trump was referring to the Pew report — especially because she referred to the same statistic later in the book when talking about being a working mom herself. ""As much as motherhood is a joy to so many of us, it is also the greatest predictor of wage inequality between men and women in our country,"" she wrote. ""Forty-seven percent of the U.S. labor force is female; 40 percent of women are their family's primary breadwinner."" ""The fact is correct,"" said Betsey Stevenson, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan and former chief economist at the U.S. Labor Department. We couldn't find any comprehensive data that spoke to how many households total, including those without kids, had women as the primary earners. Of the families where the woman is the primary breadwinner, Pew found that 37 percent are married women who earn more than their husbands, while 63 percent are single mothers. And the households with a married primary breadwinner, with a median family income of $80,000, are wealthier than the single mother households, which have a median family income of $23,000.    The Pew report is the most recent independent report we could find speaking to this issue. But we also came across a 2016 report by the liberal Center for American Progress that had similar findings. According to the Center for American Progress, 42 percent of mothers were the sole or primary breadwinners in their households in 2015. And 22.4 percent were co-breadwinners, earning one-quarter to one-half of their total household income. Even though women’s share of the labor force grew dramatically throughout the latter half of the 20th century, it has stagnated in recent years, at least in part because of a lack of family-friendly labor policies, said Casey Schoeneberger, communications director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. Our ruling Ivanka Trump said, ""40 percent of American households have female primary breadwinners."" A widely cited Pew report found that in 2011, 40 percent of American households with children under 18 had women providing most or all of the family’s income.

"['Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Science', 'PunditFact', 'Jimmy Kimmel']","
Jimmy Kimmel largely right about cuts, additions to NIH budget
","During his widely watched monologue about his newborn son’s recent medical emergency, ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel offered a bit of praise for one group of Americans that doesn’t receive much love these days: members of Congress. ""President Trump last month proposed a $6 billion cut in funding to the National Institutes of Health. And thank God our congressmen made a deal last night to not go along with that. They actually increased funding by $2 billion."" Is that what happened? Basically, yes. Kimmel has a point that by approving the increase, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress rebuked Trump’s proposal and made clear a distaste for cutting NIH. Budget experts, however, may quibble that Kimmel oversimplified a bit on the numbers. First, some background. NIH conducts and disseminates research into the causes, diagnosis, prevention and cure of human diseases. It is a collection of 27 separate institutes and centers, such as the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Explaining Kimmel’s comment starts with the release earlier this year of the Trump White House’s budget blueprint. While this proposal did not offer significant detail, it did include a cut for NIH. Specifically, the proposal would reduce spending for fiscal year 2018 by $5.8 billion compared to the fiscal 2017 level, through a range of reorganizations, consolidations and other changes. That’s short of a $6 billion cut, as Kimmel described it, but it’s pretty close. Fast-forward a few weeks to congressional negotiations over a bill to keep the government funded and avoid a government shutdown. Under the agreement reached by lawmakers, NIH would see a $2 billion increase in its budget over the five-month period of extended federal spending. (That's on top of the funding that was already expected.) According to news reports, the agreement provides an additional $400 million for Alzheimer’s disease and an additional $476 million for the National Cancer Institute, $120 million for the Precision Medicine Initiative, and an additional $110 million for the BRAIN Initiative, which aims to map the human brain. Where Kimmel oversimplified matters is on the numbers. Specifically, the $2 billion increase did not directly replace Trump’s $5.8 billion proposed cut -- the two actions are distinct, since they targeted two different fiscal years. It would have been more accurate to say that the $2 billion increase directly rejected a separate Trump proposal to cut $1.2 billion from NIH for the remainder of fiscal 2017, which concludes at the end of September. (Remember, the $5.8 billion cut was to be for the 2018 fiscal year, not for the rest of 2017.) Indeed, the Trump proposal to cut NIH by $5.8 billion in 2018 is still officially on the table since Congress hasn’t yet acted on spending for 2018. The agreement Kimmel cited only addresses a five-month extension of federal spending. That said, Kimmel’s overarching point -- that Congress effectively rejected Trump’s proposal to cut NIH -- is on target, experts say. Steve Ellis, vice president of the group Taxpayers for Common Sense, agreed that while Kimmel oversimplified the numbers, he added that the talk show host’s ""overall message is accurate. The administration sought cuts and Congress boosted the funding."" And the decision to protect NIH in the budget has been supported not just by Democrats but also by key Republicans, including the chairmen of the two chambers’ health appropriations subcommittees, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., as well as Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. ""There is no appetite on the Hill for cutting NIH,"" Stan Collender, a budget expert at the consulting firm Qorvis MSLGROUP, told PolitiFact. Our ruling Kimmel said, ""President Trump last month proposed a $6 billion cut in funding to the National Institutes of Health. And thank God our congressmen made a deal last night to not go along with that. They actually increased funding by $2 billion."" Technically, the two funding changes Kimmel referenced are for different fiscal years, so Congress didn’t precisely exchange the increase for Trump’s proposed cut. But Kimmel’s broader point is solid: The move by Congress to increase, rather than decrease, NIH’s funding for the rest of the 2017 fiscal year is a signal that lawmakers are in no mood to cut NIH’s budget by $5.8 billion once the 2018 spending bills are taken up.

"['Death Penalty', 'Pennsylvania', 'Larry Krasner']","
Philly DA candidate: I’m the only one who’ll never seek the death penalty
","There’s really no question that Philadelphia civil rights attorney and candidate for district attorney Larry Krasner has been more outspoken on the death penalty than any of his seven opponents. But is he the only candidate running for district attorney who has explicitly pledged to never seek it if elected? Krasner’s campaign, gearing up for the May 16 primary, wrote on the Democratic candidate’s platform page on his website that ""Larry Krasner is the only candidate running for District Attorney who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty."" But we swear we’ve heard that before, at least once. So we decided to check the claim. We reached out to every candidate for district attorney -- six other Democrats and one Republican -- to ask for clarification on their stance on the death penalty, including whether or not they support Gov. Tom Wolf’s death penalty moratorium (that could be overturned when another governor takes office). Here’s what we learned: Beth Grossman - We didn’t hear back from Grossman, the lone Republican candidate in the race, but she told Philadelphia Magazine in March that she supports the death penalty ""in certain cases,"" but wondered if it’s ""economically feasible."" Michael Untermeyer - Untermeyer, an ex-Republican and a former assistant district attorney, doesn’t personally support the death penalty but wouldn’t rule it out in the most extreme circumstances, his campaign said. Joe Khan - A spokesman for Khan, a former federal prosecutor, said the Democrat would only seek the death penalty in the most extreme circumstances. During a recent forum when candidates were asked if they would ever seek the death penalty, Khan responded that he wouldn’t while a statewide moratorium is in place. Jack O’Neill - O’Neill, a former assistant district attorney and a Democrat, said while prosecuting homicides in Philadelphia, he never chose to seek the death penalty. But he said he wouldn’t rule it out in the most heinous circumstances, like if a police officer were killed. Teresa Carr-Deni - The former judge’s campaign confirmed her stance is that she would only seek the death penalty in extreme or heinous circumstances. Rich Negrin - Negrin, the former city managing director, didn’t respond to a request for comment. But during a recent forum when asked if he would ever seek the death penalty if elected, Negrin responded ""no."" That’s a harder stance than he took in a February interview with Philadelphia Magazine, when he said only that he supports Wolf’s moratorium, not that he would never seek the death penalty if that moratorium were to be lifted. Tariq El-Shabazz - A spokeswoman for El-Shabazz, a former deputy under District Attorney Seth Williams, said El-Shabazz ""will not seek to impose the death penalty."" In the same forum mentioned above when asked about whether or not he would seek the death penalty, El-Shabazz responded ""no"" -- twice. But similar to Negrin, that’s different from his prior characterization. In an interview with Philadelphia Magazine in March, El-Shabazz said only that he supports Wolf’s moratorium. That means that besides Krasner, two other candidates in the race -- Negrin and El-Shabazz -- have said at one point or another that they would not seek the death penalty if elected district attorney, but both failed to offer up that hard stance when asked earlier this year. (In Krasner’s February Philadelphia Magazine interview, he said he’s strictly against the death penalty and would never seek it if elected.) A spokeswoman for El-Shabazz said his stance is ""not new,"" and the candidate himself said last month that he has opposed the death penalty for his entire career. PolitiFact Pennsylvania could not find an example from prior to April when either Negrin or El-Shabazz said publicly that they would never seek the death penalty if elected district attorney. When PolitiFact reached out to Krasner’s campaign Monday regarding the statement on their website that Krasner is ""the only candidate running for District Attorney who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty,"" a spokesman responded that that language has since been updated. The website now reads: ""Larry Krasner is the only candidate running for District Attorney who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty and has done so throughout the campaign."" ""Some of the other candidates have changed their positions so quickly that it's hard to keep up,"" spokesman Rich Garella said in an email, noting: ""We have now adjusted the language on our website to reflect the fact that two of them have recently adopted the position that [Krasner] has had for more than 30 years."" Garella wasn’t able to identify when the claim in question was posted on Krasner’s campaign website. Krasner, a well-known civil rights and criminal defense attorney, has long been an outspoken critic of the death penalty. Our ruling Krasner’s campaign for district attorney wrote that he ""is the only candidate running for District Attorney who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty."" At this point in the race, two other candidates have made a similar pledge. But it doesn’t appear either of those candidates were as explicit about that view throughout the campaign, unlike Krasner, who has long railed against the death penalty. When PolitiFact pointed out the discrepancy to Krasner’s campaign, the website was almost immediately updated. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/may/03/larry-krasner/philly-da-candidate-im-only-one-wholl-never-seek-d/

Do Wisconsin legislators get a daily stipend just for showing up?
","The Wisconsin Freedom Alliance, a conservative political group, splashed into the news briefly in 2016 when it funded ads criticizing various Republican state Senate candidates during primary campaigns. Now the group is back with a campaign charging that taxpayers are on the hook for bloated pensions, salaries and other benefits for state lawmakers of all political stripes. In an April 2017 radio ad, the alliance ripped a practice that pays Wisconsin state lawmakers a per-diem amount when they travel to the Capitol for business. ""Did you know state politicians can collect their per diems even if they don’t spend a dime on meals, or lodging or travel? No receipts are required for them to get paid. No receipts! It’s the honor system for politicians paying themselves. Does that sound like a good idea?"" Is that the way the system works? The benefit Legislators in most states qualify for per-diems. In many cases they receive more than Wisconsin lawmakers can get. That hasn’t prevented the per-diems from coming under occasional attack in Wisconsin. They top out at $115 a day for state senators, and $78.50 a day (and $157 for an overnight) for Assembly members. In 2016, overall payments to Assembly members ranged from a low of $916 to state Rep. Nancy VanderMeer (R-Tomah) to a high of $9,591 to state Rep. Peter Barca (D-Kenosha), the Assembly minority leader. In total, the 99 Assembly members received $484,504. The 33 senators received $200,860 in 2016. The payments ranged from $2,024.00 to state Sen. Terry Moulton (R-Chippewa Falls) to $14,256 to state Sen. Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau), the majority leader. Lawmakers living close to Madison qualify for lower per-diem rates. Lawmakers base salary is $50,950. The Wisconsin law governing the benefit says legislators ""shall be entitled to an allowance for expenses incurred for food and lodging for each day that he or she is in Madison on legislative business."" (italics ours). So, if the allowance is tied to spending on food and lodging, is it possible, as the alliance contended, that it is paid ""even if they don’t spend a dime on meals, or lodging or travel?"" Michael Flaherty, executive director of the Freedom Alliance, cited a Dec. 30, 2016 story by the USA Today Network-Wisconsin, headlined ""Madison lawmakers max out hometown perk"". The story said ""Lawmakers can collect the money as income without spending a dime on meals, lodging or gas. No receipts of expenses are required to get paid."" The no-receipts claim is on target, according to the clerks for the Senate and Assembly. Lawmakers are not asked to itemize. As for whether a lawmaker who skips meals and drives home to sleep can still get a per diem, the answer is, yes, that’s possible. But it’s impossible to say how often that happens, given the loose accounting system. ""It’s a benefit, an allowance,"" said Senate Chief Clerk Jeff Renk. In Renk’s opinion, despite the statute’s talk of expenses incurred, lawmakers who incur no expense while collecting a per diem are not violating the law. The perk is so automatic that lawmakers, at the beginning of a two-year legislative session, choose whether to receive the maximum daily reimbursement for days they travel to Madison within that period. That’s how the law was written. All they have to do to collect is confirm their appearances by entering a mark in a computer program. One piece of the group’s claim requires a minor clarification. Travel costs in the form of mileage are reimbursed separately from the per-diem payments. Our rating The Wisconsin Freedom Alliance claimed that state lawmakers get daily expense payments ""even if they don’t spend a dime on meals, or lodging or travel,"" and ""no receipts are required for them to get paid."" Per diems are built on an honor system that requires no documentation that any travel or lodging expense has been incurred. Travel costs, though, have nothing to do with per diems, and some clarification is necessary here because no one can say how often lawmakers get the per diem without spending anything.

Philly DA candidate blasts investigative journalism: I never repped a client on Death Row
","DA candidate Tariq El-Shabazz went nuclear on reporter Ryan Briggs last week after Briggs published an investigative story on City & State PA questioning El-Shabazz’s handling of a 2000 murder case. In a two-page critique released on Twitter, El-Shabazz referred to Briggs as a ""fake news reporter"" and accused him of racism. The long statement, released Friday, also suggested Briggs had incorrectly stated the former client of El Shabazz was on death row and included this line: ""In my 30 year career including dozens of capital cases, not a single client of mine has ever been sentenced to death."" Has El-Shabazz really never represented someone who was sentenced to death? We’ll start with Anthony Brown. Briggs’ article originally included the following passage: ""With nothing but death row ahead of him, Brown began to file state and federal court petitions largely centering around El-Shabazz’s failure to investigate his case."" According to a Philadelphia Daily News article from 2000, Brown was given a life sentence for the murder. State records also indicate nobody by the name Anthony Brown has been sentenced to death in Pennsylvania. Greg Salisbury, editor of City & State PA, said the line about death row was a copy editing error. He said the story was corrected Monday. The above sentence now reads, ""With nothing but the rest of his life in prison ahead of him,"" and a correction is noted at the end of the piece. But another client of El-Shabazz, infamous drug dealer Kaboni Savage, presents a murkier picture. In 2013, Savage was given a federal death sentence for 12 counts of murder, six of which stemmed from a 2004 retaliatory fire bombing in North Philly. El-Shabazz, however, did not represent Savage during the federal case for which he received the death penalty. Salima Suswell, a spokesperson for El-Shabazz, said he was disqualified from representing Savage because of a conflict of interest and couldn’t represent him. The conflict arose because of the earlier case in which he repped Savage. In federal court filings, El-Shabazz is not listed as an attorney for Savage in the case. The earliest motion by the defense comes from Christopher Warren, who was a court-appointed attorney. Savage wasn’t El-Shabazz’s client in that matter, Suswell said. ""So the statement stands as true."" A 2004 Inquirer article indicates El-Shabazz was representing Savage when the drug dealer was already being suspected — but not yet charged — in the fire bombing. The article explains that the FBI was targeting Savage, lists El-Shabazz as his lawyer and quotes him as saying Savage had nothing to do with the firebombing ""directly or indirectly."" So the fact-check comes down to this question: Is it fair for a lawyer to say none of his clients have ever been sentenced to death when a major client of his received a death sentence in a case he didn’t litigate after being disqualified from representing him? Two legal experts say yes. Claire Finkelstein, director of the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at Penn, said given the context, El-Shabazz’s statement is not incorrect. ""He’s trying to prove he’s a good lawyer,"" Finkelstein said. ""If you look at the spirit of it, it doesn’t falsify the claim. He’s not responsible for that guy getting the death penalty."" Said Jules Epstein, a longtime trial lawyer and a professor at Temple Law, who disclosed that he knows El-Shabazz: ""The fact that a former client got the death penalty with a different attorney is no reflection on this lawyer whatsoever."" Our Ruling After a critical article was published about him last week, Tariq El-Shabazz released a statement Friday calling reporter Ryan Briggs racist and of publishing fake news. In his statement, El-Shabazz said the article had incorrectly claimed former client Anthony Brown was given a death sentence and that not a single client of his had ever been sentenced to death. Brown was not given the death penalty. He received a life sentence, and City & State PA corrected the error Monday. But a former client of El-Shabazz, Kaboni Savage, received a death sentence. El-Shabazz, however, did not represent Savage in the federal case that led to the sentence. Because he didn’t represent Savage in that case, a spokesperson for El-Shabazz said his claim stands as true. A former trial lawyer and expert on legal ethics agree. But while true in a legal sense, El-Shabazz’s statement needs clarification.

Donald Trump says Michael Flynn got security clearance from Obama administration
","President Donald Trump says that when Michael Flynn joined his campaign, President Barack Obama’s administration had already given him a once-over. In an April 30 interview on CBS, Trump framed this detail as an inconvenient fact that the media is ignoring in order to prop up their ""phony"" storyline about Trump associates’ ties to Russia. ""In fact, I just heard where General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration,"" he said. ""And when he went to Russia, I didn't realize this, when he went to Russia, it was 2015, and he was on the Obama clearance."" Flynn, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under Obama, was ousted from his Trump administration role as national security adviser after it came to light that Flynn had lied about the nature of his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Now he’s the focus of a tangential controversy, complete with an investigation by the Pentagon’s watchdog, over payments he received from foreign governments, including Russia. We were interested in Trump’s statement that the Obama administration approved Flynn for security clearance, especially given that he was forced out of his Obama-era role in 2014. We found that Trump has it right. But that doesn’t affect the main allegation against Flynn: that he didn’t properly disclose payments he received from Russia, as required by law and Pentagon policy. Nor does it excuse any oversights the Trump team made while considering Flynn for a White House role. Flynn’s foreign affairs Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, spent his career as an intelligence officer in the Army, serving in both Iraq and Afghanistan and as director of intelligence for U.S. Central Command, among other posts. Obama promoted him to director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in April 2012. Flynn retired from the agency in August 2014; news reports at the time said Flynn was forced out because he ruffled feathers with his management style. Since his departure, he has said he was fired for ""calling our enemies radical jihadis.""  In 2015, Flynn received more than $56,000 from three Russian entities — $33,750 from state-backed media outlet RT, $11,250 from an air cargo company, and $11,250 from a cybersecurity firm — according to documents released by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. In 2016, during the election, Flynn’s consulting firm earned more than $500,000 to work on projects that benefited the Turkish government. This became public knowledge in March 2017, when the firm filed papers to the Justice Department to retroactively register as a foreign agent. Several months after Flynn left the DIA in 2014, he received a letter from the agency providing guidance on what he can and can’t do as an Army retiree. The letter, which Flynn himself requested, says ""foreign compensation requires advance approval,"" per the Constitution’s emoluments clause. Despite the letter, Flynn did not disclose to the government the payments he received from the Russian entities, according to Cummings and his Republican counterpart on the oversight committee, Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah. An April 7 letter from the DIA to Cummings and Chaffetz said the agency ""did not locate any records referring or relating to LTG Flynn’s receipt of money from a foreign source"" nor ""any records of LTG Flynn seeking permission or approval for the receipt of money from a foreign source."" Flynn’s lawyer responded, saying Flynn briefed the Defense Department on his RT speaking event. But the lawyer did not specifically say whether Flynn disclosed the payments. Here’s how Trump’s claim about Flynn’s security clearances fits in. Retired military officials can keep their security clearances, with periodic background checks. Flynn’s last two background checks to retain his security clearance took place during the Obama administration, in June 2010 and January 2016, according to the April 7 DIA letter. Cummings and Chaffetz said Flynn didn’t report his 2015 earnings from Russian entities on his 2016 application. (The DIA provided Cummings and Chaffetz with portions of Flynn’s completed form, but the pages haven’t been made public.) The security clearance application asks extensively about applicants’ foreign contacts, activities, business and travel. The penalty for knowingly falsifying or concealing information on the form is a fine or up to five years in prison. The evaluating agency may also deny the person a security clearance. Even if an applicant is candid about their foreign dealings, the evaluating agency could deny security clearance if it seems like those activities could compromise the applicant’s judgment or loyalty to the United States, said Andrew Kent, a national security expert and law professor at Fordham University. White House press secretary Sean Spicer has used the fact that Flynn got through security clearance under the Obama administration to deflect blame for not properly vetting Flynn before Trump named him national security adviser. Democrats, like Cummings and Obama-era National Security Adviser Susan Rice, have said Spicer’s critique is unfair. They said Flynn’s security clearance re-evaluation was a routine process that took place several rungs below the White House, and besides, Trump is obligated to vet his advisers himself. Kent said that if those evaluating Flynn’s 2016 application had some knowledge of his Russian activities, they might deserve some blame for not pressing Flynn for more details. Because Flynn’s relationship with RT was public knowledge months before Trump was putting his White House team together, the transition team was ""in a different position than the security clearance investigators."" Our ruling Trump said, ""General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration."" The last two times Flynn applied for a security clearance, in 2010 and 2016, Obama was president. Lawmakers allege Flynn omitted important information about payments received from Russia on his 2016 application to renew his clearance.

Persistent post incorrectly says Lindsey Graham to become Democrat over Trump
","Online reports said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., would switch parties unless the GOP stops supporting President Donald Trump. The headlines are wrong, even though the stories use real quotes from Graham. ""Lindsey Graham threatens to convert to Democrat if Republicans don’t Dump Trump,"" read the headline from a March 21, 2017, post from TrueTrumpers.com. Facebook users reported the post as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to crack down on fake news. The headline is certainly made up, because there’s no evidence Graham has considered trading in his elephant for a donkey. The story, meanwhile, does use real quotes in which Graham disagreed with Trump — albeit before the real estate billionaire was president. We can tell this is an old article, because TrueTrumpers.com’s post called Trump the ""the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee."" The bulk of the story concerns Trump’s attacks on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the judge overseeing a fraud case involving Trump University. Trump had said in June 2016 that Curiel had ""an absolute conflict"" because of his ""Mexican heritage,"" saying Curiel was biased against Trump over his calls to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Curiel shrugged off the comments, and approved a $25 million settlement in the case. The judge has recently been assigned a case brought by a young man deported in February 2017, despite being protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The TrueTrumpers.com post said Graham told the New York Times that Trump’s comments were ""the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy. If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it."" Graham did say this, in a June 6, 2016 story in the New York Times. The post also uses another real quote from Graham, who told NBC News’ Hallie Jackson the following day: ""There are a lot of people who want to be loyal to the Republican Party, including me. But there’ll come a point in time where we’re gonna have to understand that it’s not just about the 2016 race, it’s about the future of the party and I would like to support our nominee. I just can’t."" There are also quotes from Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine (although the post referred to Collins as a representative instead of a senator). The TrueTrumpers.com story largely copied a June 7, 2016, article on the Huffington Post, and has appeared on other websites prior to this March 21 post. A June 9 post on WeAreChange.org had the same story, but with a slightly different headline that read, ""Lindsey Graham will become a Democrat if Republicans select Trump,"" reflecting that Trump had not yet been officially nominated. The first couple of paragraphs were altered from the Huffington Post article. By March 20, 2017, a post on Spinzon.com had the same headline as the TrueTrumpers.com post. It’s apparent that a radical headline was slapped on the story to drive traffic. Graham did not say he was planning on changing his party affiliation, but he did disagree with Trump’s comments about a federal judge.

CNN's Margaret Hoover corrects claim on Jimmy Kimmel's son's surgery, Medicaid
","On CNN, a panel of commentators discussed some of the health-policy issues surrounding Jimmy Kimmel’s revelation the night before that his newborn had to have surgery for a rare heart defect. In a video clip that went viral, Kimmel devoted the monologue of his ABC late-night show to telling the story of the birth of his son, Billy. Shortly after he was born, doctors discovered a serious congenital heart defect known as tetralogy of Fallot. The doctors were able to operate on Billy, and their efforts appear to be successful, though additional surgeries may eventually be needed. In addition to drawing widespread popular interest in his son’s story, Kimmel touched on the current debate over whether or how to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. In the monologue, he urged lawmakers not to return Americans to the days before the law, when a pre-existing condition -- like his son’s -- could prevent you from securing health insurance. ""If your baby is going to die and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make,"" Kimmel said. ""I think that’s something that whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?"" Kimmel’s monologue inspired a discussion of health care policy on a CNN segment moderated by anchor Kate Bolduan the following day. At one point, CNN commentator Margaret Hoover noted that, for all the concern about Kimmel’s situation, poor families would be less likely than a celebrity to have access to a world-class surgical team. Referring to the Kimmel surgery, she said, ""Medicaid has stopped providing this kind of service. Our health care system is broken, and the poorest of us cannot afford it."" We wondered whether she was correct, so we started contacting experts. Before we could finish our research, Hoover emailed us to say that she had misspoken. ""The point I had intended to make was that poorer families, especially those who have received health coverage under the ACA, have largely received it through Medicaid expansion, which increasingly isn't accepted at hospitals,"" she said in an email. ""Sadly, in an emotional segment, I misspoke,"" Hoover told us. Hoover said she realized she had said something wrong when she began seeing criticism in her Twitter mentions. Hoover tweeted a correction shortly after our email exchange: ""Correction to misspeaking w/ @KateBolduan: I accidentally said Medicaid has stopped providing ‘that kind of service.’ … Point I intended to make was that hospitals increasingly don’t accept Medicaid. … Which means poor families have a harder time getting Kimmel’s level of care already.""  For the record, the experts we contacted agreed that Medicaid has not done anything to cut off its beneficiaries from complex pediatric surgeries like the one Kimmel’s son underwent. Hoover’s initial remark on CNN was ""totally incorrect,"" said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University. In fact, she said, ""Medicaid is the major source of health insurance coverage for children’s hospitals and the specialized services they offer."" MaryBeth Musumeci, associate director of the Kaiser Family Foundation, added that Medicaid covers a broad range of services for children under its Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment benefit, called EPSDT. Any state that accepts Medicaid funding must offer EPSDT to children from birth through age 21, she said. As a practical matter, this means that Medicaid must cover necessary services for children’s physical or mental health, even if that service is not covered by Medicaid for adults in that state, she said. At PolitiFact, our policy is to correct a speaker’s original misstatement while noting subsequent corrections by the speaker. Hoover, for her part, did have a point when she mentioned the relative lack of access for Medicaid beneficiaries. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that while 85 percent of physicians accepted new patients with private insurance, only 69 percent accepted new patients with Medicaid. Hoover pointed to this column, by Scott W. Atlas, a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University, to support her point. ""People on Medicaid have more challenges accessing specialists than the privately insured, and the more high-tech and innovative, the more challenging that may be,"" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush.   Our ruling Hoover said that, regarding the surgery that saved Kimmel’s son, ""Medicaid has stopped providing this kind of service."" That’s wrong -- Medicaid does cover this kind of service, and indeed, the federal-state program is a key source of reimbursement for children’s hospitals. Hoover quickly acknowledged that she was wrong and tweeted a correction.

Matt Damon: Poor often pay 25% of their income on water
","Hollywood star Matt Damon has been a champion of bringing clean water and sanitation to the world’s poor for many years, co-founding the group Water.org. The organization links families to microloans so they can tap into safe water supplies. In a conversation with the president of the World Bank, Damon tried to convey a sense of the severity of the problem. ""The poor often pay more for water than the middle class,"" Damon said. ""These people have no savings,  but they’re paying every day, in some cases, up to 25 percent of their income just for water."" People who live in poverty always spend most if not every penny of what little they earn on basic necessities. That is part of the crushing reality of being poor. But we wanted to know about the fraction of their income that goes toward water.  The poor often pay more for #water than the middle class. They have no savings, but spend up to 25% of income for water. —Matt Damon @water pic.twitter.com/Ar98ZUOH6X Rosemary Gudelj, spokeswoman for Water.org, told us the statistic was based somewhat on anecdotal evidence. Gudelj said Damon drew on the work of the group’s co-founder Gary White. ""Gary’s statement has been, ‘I have met people who pay up to 25 percent of their income on water,’ "" Gudelj said. ""This comes from Gary’s experience in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, when doing research for his master’s thesis."" That might not seem like much to hang a claim on, but we did find a 2006 United Nations Development Program estimate that confirmed Damon’s point. ""In Uganda water payments represent as much as 22 percent of the average income of urban households in the poorest 20 percent of the income distribution,"" the report said. The report went on to say that in countries such as Argentina, El Salvador and Jamaica, the bottom fifth of households were spending over 10 percent of their money on water. The core problem, the report said, is the poorest families often pay the highest prices for water because they aren’t connected to the pipes that provide service to middle class and wealthy homes: ""In Jakarta, Lima, Manila and Nairobi households living in slums and low-­income settlements typically pay 5–10 times or more for their water than high-income residents of the same city. In Manila an estimated 4 million people receive water resold through kiosks, pushcart vendors or tanker deliveries."" Each of those middlemen take their cut, and the cost of water rises accordingly. Now, that United Nations report is a decade old and progress has been made since. But Damon avoided hard numbers and the risk that some would be outdated. Taken at face value, he only said that some people pay as much as 25 percent of their income on water. To know the reality, the gold standard would be household spending surveys from a range of countries. But it looks like current ones for water expenditures don’t exist. A report from the advocacy group WaterAid used a baseline assumption that someone was buying the 50 liters/day minimum for drinking water and and sanitation set by the World Health Organization in compiling hypothetical water bills for many countries. But Michael Hanemann, an economist who specializes in water at the University of California Berkeley, said that’s a dicey set of calculations. ""In economics it is the case that when something is expensive, people buy less of it,"" he told PolitiFact. ""It is more likely that they are getting by with less water."" Or as likely, they are using unclean water, and paying the price with illness and bad health. By the way, the average water and sewer bill in the United States is about 0.5 percent of household income, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Our ruling Damon said that poor people sometimes pay as much as 25 percent of their income for water. A decade-old United Nations report said that the urban poor in Uganda were paying very nearly that much, about 22 percent of their wages. Damon’s co-founder of Water.org has seen people spending this much in his work in Honduras. More recent hard data appears to be in short supply. But it wouldn’t take much for Damon’s claim to be accurate. Given that poor people pay an inordinate share of whatever money they have for basic needs, and they tend to live in places where water costs more, some people probably do spend as much as Damon said. The facts we have are enough for us to rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/may/01/matt-damon/matt-damon-some-pay-25-their-income-water/

Does China account for 90% of North Korean trade, as Rex Tillerson said?
","The Trump administration has cited China's trade relationship with North Korea as a key lever to deter the regime from producing a nuclear missile capable of striking the U.S. ""We must all do our share,"" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the U.N. Security Council April 28. ""But China, accounting for 90 percent of North Korean trade, China alone has economic leverage over Pyongyang that is unique, and its role is therefore particularly important."" Tillerson’s remarks, which included a call for fresh economic sanctions, came at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and North Korea. As a U.S. Navy strike group steamed toward the Korean Peninsula -- where 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea are on alert following the latest provocations from Pyongyang -- President Donald Trump on April 27 warned of a possible ""major conflict"" if diplomatic efforts fail. We’ve previously looked at Trump’s claim about the degree of control Beijing wields over Pyongyang. With Tillerson citing Chinese-North Korean trade relations as a vital diplomatic pressure point, we decided to explore how much China accounts for North Korea’s overall trade with the outside world. Finding accurate data for the secretive regime is a bit tricky since no North Korean equivalent of Trade.gov with troves of trade data exists, as Pyongyang treats this information as a state secret. But so-called ""mirror statistics,"" an accounting of data reconstructed from other countries’ reports, offer a workaround, albeit a flawed one, since the statistics don’t capture some transactions. The available data tell a story of growing dependence on Chinese trade over roughly the past two decades as economic sanctions levied by the UN and individual countries, as well as other factors, have seen North Korea’s trade with other partners fall drastically. In 2000, China, South Korea and Japan each accounted for about a fifth of the regime's overall trade, with the rest of the world making up the remaining roughly two-fifths. Since then, China’s slice of the pie has more than quadrupled, according to Stephan Haggard, professor of Korea-Pacific Studies at the University of California-San Diego. ""As sanctions have reduced South Korean and Japanese trade basically to nothing, trade has naturally become focused more on China,"" Haggard said. ""The rest of the world has not picked up the slack."" Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics agreed that China’s current position as an outsize trade partner of North Korea is largely a function of Pyongyang’s strained relations with its neighbor to the south -- but he noted this could change if political winds shift. ""The reason that the percentage is so high is that South Korea, which was North Korea’s second largest trade partner, imposed sanctions and trade between the two countries is virtually nil,"" Noland said. ""If South Korea were to resume trade relations (as it might in the next administration) China’s share of North Korean trade would fall, but China would still be the country’s principal trade partner."" Bilateral disputes led to Tokyo imposing sanctions that went even further than UN restrictions, said Haggard, who noted that the commercial risk associated with North Korea and its poor record on honoring property rights have also dissuaded potential trade partners. As South Korean and Japanese trade with Pyongyang fell, China’s economy boomed, fueling increased trade with North Korea -- a relationship unfettered by bilateral sanctions, as Beijing has traditionally viewed the regime as an ally. China has also been accused of being less compliant with UN sanctions than other countries. As a result of these factors, the consensus among experts we spoke to is that China now accounts for roughly 90 percent of North Korean trade.  Source: Stephan Haggard, professor of Korea-Pacific Studies at the University of California-San Diego. UNSCR refers to United Nations Security Council Resolutions. ""Yes, China accounts for more than 90 percent of North Korea’s recorded trade,"" Noland said. ""They are the primary supplier of oil and the marginal supplier of grain. If China wanted to, it could bring North Korea to its knees."" ""It has the economic leverage, but has been unwilling to use it, perhaps because it fears destabilizing the regime,"" he added. Our ruling Tillerson said, ""China account(s) for 90 percent of North Korean trade."" China’s role as an outsize trade partner of North Korea is a relatively new development. Since 2000, trade with the rest of the world has dropped off, as Chinese trade has risen. While the ratio is subject to change based on political factors, China now accounts for around 90 percent of North Korean trade.

Reports about Ted Nugent dying (or not) on hunting trip is convoluted hoax
","A series of Internet posts that claimed outspoken rocker Ted Nugent had been killed in a hunting accident — then was assassinated, then was faking his own death — was all fake news. A fake news story that appeared on multiple disreputable websites on April 28, 2017, carried a headline that read, ""Conservative icon Ted Nugent killed in hunting accident."" Facebook users reported the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the site’s efforts to keep fake news out of users’ news feeds. The story, which is fake, said Nugent was hunting from a tree stand before dawn somewhere in Montana when he was shot ""in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear."" The unnamed hunter faced manslaughter charges and was being held by state police in Boseman (which is really spelled Bozeman). But that’s not the end of the story, by a long shot. The post originated on April 28 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. TheLastLineOfDefense.org fabricates posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."" In this case, the site followed up its own story with another fake post the same day that said Nugent actually had been killed purposely by a ""white sympathizer"" named James Alan Whitland, under the alias Alex Hayne. This story also ended up on multiple sites. Whitland, the second post read, had been a teenage hitman for the Black Panthers and had assisted the man who killed five Dallas police officers in 2016. The post said Whitland had been caught by a game warden after Nugent was killed. Nugent and his wife Shermane posted a Facebook Live video the same day he was supposedly shot, confirming that he was alive.   But there’s more: TheLastLineOfDefense.org then posted a third item, on April 29, saying that Nugent was actually still alive. The third post said Nugent actually had called ""local channel WKLU NBC2"" (actually an Indianapolis-area radio station) and made up the story and had been ""drinking iced tea at the local police station with his accomplices"" as the news hit social media. This fake post said two Bozeman police officers had been charged with helping create the hoax and had been ""relieved of their duties."" Nugent faced a year in jail and more than $1 million in fines over the waste of resources committed to the hoax, the site said, admitting that TheLastLineOfDefense.org had been fooled, too. Of course, this was all fake, because the site is the outlet that made up the stories in the first place. Our contact with the supposed creator of TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a person who says his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, did not reply to our email seeking comment on the ruse. Nugent’s assistant, Linda Peterson, did reply to PolitiFact’s questions about the stories, sending a two-word email that read, ""Fake news."" It’s apparent Nugent was not killed, nor did he perpetrate his own death hoax. The only real news about him recently is his trip to the White House on April 19.

Reports that Sarah Palin in coma after hit and run accident are fake
","A fake report spread on the eve of President Donald Trump’s 100th day in office said former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was in a coma after a car accident. ""Sarah Palin in a coma after hit and run,"" read the headline on an April 28, 2017, post. We first saw it on FreedomCrossroads.us, a website registered in Maine. But the post appeared on several other websites across the Internet without being attributed to an original source. Facebook users reported the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the site’s efforts to clear out fake news from user news feeds. The fake story said that Palin had been driving on the Pacific Coast Highway (with no state given) that morning when she was run off the road by another, unspecified vehicle. The post said her SUV rolled several times and stopped in a drainage ditch. The image used to illustrate the rollover was actually of a fatal 2015 accident in Mississippi.   Palin was ""currently in a coma with 2 broken vertebrae and a broken thigh,"" according to the post. Authorities were searching for the other vehicle, which was caught on camera, the article said. The FBI had reportedly been dispatched, too. Palin had been tweeting right before noon and even later in the day, and posts kept appearing both on her Twitter and Facebook accounts through the weekend. We attempted to reach her office through her website, SarahPalin.com, and by email, but received no response. There was no coverage by any legitimate media outlet of an accident involving Palin, which you’d figure would be spotlighted on cable news. The sensational nature of the story, misappropriated photo and lack of specifics made it obvious this was fake news. But the Internet wasn’t done, because a follow-up post appeared on April 30. That story again was shared on multiple websites, including FreedomCrossroads.us. It said Palin had woken up and was able to identify who ran her off the road. That story said the California Highway Patrol traced a license plate back to a car rented with a fake ID, with video from a security camera at rental company in Silicon Valley. The post described a white man in his 30s. Several websites used the same image, but it was actually of a robbery suspect at an Oklahoma hotel in 2012. But since the first story didn’t happen, the second one didn’t, either. The only wide coverage Palin had received as of late was a well-publicized visit to the White House on April 19. There’s zero proof this happened, despite what fake news websites said.
