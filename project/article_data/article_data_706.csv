LeBron James pays Social Security taxes before halftime of first game, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson says
","Not only has U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson endorsed presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, he also has echoed one of the senator’s main platform planks that the rich should help shore up Social Security. At a Senate campaign debate with U.S. Rep. David Jolly, R-Indian Shores, in Orlando on April 25, 2016, Grayson said the Social Security payroll tax cap on earnings needs to be lifted in order to make the program solvent. He used the mind-boggling salary of professional basketball superstar LeBron James to illustrate his point. ""Let's talk about LeBron James. Do you know when he stops paying his Social Security taxes? He stops paying his Social Security taxes at the beginning of the second quarter of the first game of the season,"" Grayson said. ""Rest of the game, pays nothing. Rest of the 81 games of the season, pays nothing. The offseason, still pays nothing. That's ridiculous."" The Cleveland Cavaliers forward rakes in an average of $23.5 million per year as part of his current two-year contract, so it’s not like he’s going to depend on Social Security in his twilight years. But is Grayson right that James is done paying into the program before halftime of the first game of the season? It’s not a slam dunk, but the Orlando Democrat does score points with this one. Tax tip-off Let’s start by reviewing what Grayson is talking about. The federal government imposes a payroll tax of 6.2 percent on wages to pay into the Social Security fund. But there’s a limit of how much income can be taxed. This maximum amount, which is periodically adjusted upward, was $118,500 in 2016. That means the most any employed person pays into Social Security annually is $7,347 (6.2 percent of $118,500). If you make less than $118,500, you obviously are taxed on that amount and pay less. Employers match that amount, so a single worker’s total contribution to Social Security is essentially a maximum of $14,694 per year. Benefits, for the record, also are capped. In the case of self-employment, the person pays both halves of the $14,694 contribution, or 12.4 percent of $118,500. We’ll come back to this in a moment. If you make more than $118,500 in salary from an employer — say, $23.5 million or so — you’re still only on the hook for taxes on the maximum of $118,500. That’s the highest amount on which the government can tax anyone, LeBron James or otherwise. Grayson has said that this limit is exacerbating projected Social Security deficits as more people retire. Not only would lifting this cap keep the program solvent, it would allow the government to increase benefits for seniors. President Barack Obama also has proposed lifting this cap, which has rated a Promise Broken on our Obameter. Some argue that raising the maximum taxable wage base wouldn’t fix the system on its own. For his James example, Grayson broke down the NBA 82 regular-season games into their 328 respective quarters, then divided that against James’ $23.5 million average salary. That amounts to $71,646.34 per quarter, which is almost $6,000 per minute, with 12-minute quarters. Not bad for a night’s work. Using that math, James hits the $118,500 taxable earnings cap somewhere before the eighth minute of the second quarter of the first game of the season. You’re probably only on your second (maybe third) $11 beer by then. Now, this interpretation is obviously just to make Grayson’s point easier to understand. It’s kind of like Tax Freedom Day, ostensibly the day people earn enough to pay their total tax bill. How James gets paid depends on the structure of his contract.  We'll also note that the NBA season starts in October, with the playoffs running through June.  The tax year starts Jan. 1 and runs the calendar year. That makes the actual timing of when taxes are deducted from James' pay different than what Grayson said — a minor detail in a broad example. The Cavaliers' first game of 2016 was on Jan. 2, and was their 31st contest of the 2015-16 season. They beat the Orlando Magic, 104-79, by the way. It may sound minor to those of us not making millions annually, but while Grayson is sticking to the game clock, he understates James’ time commitment. This example doesn’t include the hours James spends practicing, traveling, giving interviews, attending team events or anything else that goes along with a superstar athlete’s life. It also doesn’t include preseason games, overtime, playoff games (which bring in more money) or the value of his endorsements, which Forbes estimated at $48 million. PKF O’Connor Davies sports accountant Robert Raiola also cautions that Grayson’s example doesn’t mention other taxes James must pay. Raiola pointed out James faces a 1.45 percent Medicare tax that includes no cap, plus a 0.9 percent Medicare surcharge on all the income he makes over $250,000. Which is a lot. And don’t forget that self-employment tax. James possibly also must pay that in some form, depending on how his income is structured, Raiola said. How that affects James depends on how he conducts his finances, so it’s not really possible to say without getting a peek into his books. (LeBron, if you’re reading, email us and we’ll talk.) But Grayson’s talking point — that no matter how much the mega-rich earn, they are only taxed on the maximum of $118,500 in income — holds up. If you make less than that, you pay less, but James isn’t required to pay Social Security payroll taxes on his income beyond $118,500.   Our ruling Grayson said James ""stops paying his Social Security taxes at the beginning of the second quarter of the first game of the season."" That’s a broad statement meant to draw attention to the fact that Social Security taxes are capped at $118,500 of a person’s income, no matter how much they make. There are a lot of factors that go into how much James is paid, and how much of that goes to various taxes. But the bottom line is that the athlete only faces Social Security taxes for a relative sliver of his income. We rate the statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7010f3db-ddad-4d0d-98a5-197ed37eab1a UPDATE, April 28: An astute reader pointed out a minor flaw in Grayson's specific talking point. The NBA season starts in the fall, while the tax year begins Jan. 1. As such, James hypothetically would hit the threshold in the second quarter of the first game he played in the new calendar year, not the first game of the season. We've added that information to this story. But Grayson's point that the uber-wealthy quickly hit the Social Security tax cap remains just as valid. ",/factchecks/2016/apr/28/alan-grayson/lebron-james-pays-social-security-taxes-halftime-f/

No, Donald Trump, ISIS is not 'making millions of dollars a week' selling Libyan oil
","Libya’s violence and political instability has vexed the United States and other major powers since long-serving ruler Col. Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown by NATO-backed forces in 2011. Security experts say the turmoil has allowed ISIS to gain a foothold in the North African country, allowing the jihadists a haven from which to train and plan attacks abroad. And while ISIS is blamed for attacking Libya’s oil fields in recent months, experts strongly disagree with a claim GOP frontrunner Donald Trump repeated on April 27 during his foreign policy speech in Washington. ""And now ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil,"" Trump said in the speech. Our research Experts and news articles say ISIS has attacked Libya’s oil fields to disrupt oil markets and prevent rival groups from making a profit. But, they say, the group does not have the ability to operate the country’s few and complex oil refineries. This all contradicts Trump’s assertion. David Mack, an expert on Libya and terrorism with the nonpartisan Middle East Institute, called Trump’s claim ""absolutely untrue."" ""I don’t know where he got this gem of misinformation,"" he told PolitiFact. Claudia Gazzini, a Tripoli-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, also rejected Trump’s statement. Gazzini said in an email to PolitiFact: ""While it is true that ISIS has attacked oil fields in the Sirte basin area and destroyed key equipment there, they have not sought to keep control of the oil fields. ""At the moment they appear to have adopted a hit-and-run strategy. There is no evidence that they are pumping out the crude oil and certainly no evidence that they are trading it. At the moment they just appear interested in starving the Libyan state of oil revenues."" Gazzini made the same comments to the Washington Post Fact Checker when it examined a similar comment Trump made on NBC’s Today show on April 21. The Post gave Trump four Pinocchios, which it reserves for only the biggest falsehoods. The West Point-based Combating Terrorism Center also examined the ISIS/Libyan oil question. In a March 17 report it stated: ""It is simply hard for the Islamic State to do much in (Libya’s oil fields) beyond episodic attacks."" Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request to explain his comment. Our ruling Trump said, ""ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil."" Experts and news reports say ISIS has attacked Libya’s oil fields in recent months, amid the country’s instability. But they roundly reject Trump’s claim that ISIS jihadists based in that country have been able to seize, refine and sell the oil for ""millions of dollars a week."" Instead, they say, the terrorist group is focused on disrupting oil markets and preventing rivals from getting the oil in Libya.

Donald Trump did not warn the Iraq War would 'destabilize the Middle East' before it started
","When Donald Trump laid out the fundamentals of his foreign policy at a Washington hotel conference room, he offered his go-to proof of sound judgment.  ""I was totally against the war in Iraq, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East,"" he said April 27, 2016. Not in any way we could find. Let’s review the record of what Trump said when about the Iraq War. The war began in March 2003. We searched the Nexis database of transcripts and news reports from 2002 to 2008. From what we found, if Trump saw regional destabilization on the horizon, he kept it under wraps. In a September 2002 interview,  shock jock Howard Stern asked Trump if he supported the Iraq invasion. Trump responded, ""Yeah, I guess so."" That isn’t a ringing endorsement of the war, but Trump did not decry the march toward military action in the way thousands of protesters had been doing for months in 2002. On Jan. 28, 2003, just under three months before the invasion, Fox News’ Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy. Speaking of Iraq, Trump said, ""Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet, and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned."" Trump seems to be skeptical of the mission in Iraq here, and he said the economy should be a higher priority. But he did not say anything that resembles his claim that Bush should not proceed because a war would ""destabilize the Middle East."" About a week after the war began, Trump gave a mix of views. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that ""the war’s a mess,"" according to the Washington Post. But he also told Fox News that because of the war, ""The market’s going to go up like a rocket."" On Sept. 11, 2003, Trump told MSNBC, ""It wasn’t a mistake to fight terrorism and fight it hard, and I guess maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq."" By 2004, Trump begins to take a tougher stand against the war. (A big hat-tip to Buzzfeed for this.) On April 16, 2004, Trump is back with Stern. ""I think Iraq is a terrible mistake,"" Trump said. ""And to think that when we leave, it’s gonna be this nice democratic country. I mean, give me a break. There’s usually a reason why a country is run a certain way."" Trump amplified on that in an August 2004 article in Esquire: ""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn't have. ""What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!"" In November 2004, he told CNN’s Larry King, ""I do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we'll be getting out."" Clearly Trump opposed the Iraq War in its early years. There’s no evidence, though, that he advocated against the war beforehand, or that he was especially vocal about it destabilizing the Middle East. We reached out to the Trump campaign and did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said, ""I was totally against the war in Iraq, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East."" The record shows at best some early reservations about the war that evolved into opposition about a year after the war began. However, we find no evidence of Trump warning about regional destabilization before or after the war started. We rate this statement False.",/factchecks/2016/apr/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-iraq-war-destabilize/

Mystery: Strom Thurmond, Puerto Rico and bankruptcy protection
","Did he or didn’t he? Only the ghost of Strom Thurmond knows for sure. Mystery surrounds whether, back in 1984, the former senator from South Carolina knowingly deprived Puerto Rico of bankruptcy protections that every U.S. state enjoys. It’s crunch time for Puerto Rico. The island territory needs to pay bondholders $422 million on May 1. It doesn’t have the cash, it can’t use bankruptcy to reschedule its payments, and Congress seems unlikely to craft a solution in time to avoid a massive default. During his April 24, 2016, HBO show Last Week Tonight, comedian and social critic John Oliver described the devil’s brew of legal oddities and fiscal recklessness by Puerto Rican officials that brought the island territory of the United States to the financial brink. ""If you are massively in debt and you can’t declare bankruptcy, you are stuck,"" Oliver said. ""And this happened because of a tiny amendment to a law in 1984, and the crazy thing is, no one can say why it was written."" The tiny amendment Oliver mentioned was stuck in the most boring location one could ever imagine — in the definitions section of HR 5174, a bill geared mainly to fixing the bankruptcy court system. Buried in a long list of changes was the meaning of ""state."" "" 'State' includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, except for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under chapter 9 of this title;"" That was it. With those two dozen words, the bankruptcy protections that applied to every state, and until 1984, to Puerto Rico, too, were wiped away. ""We tried to find out for ourselves why that amendment got attached,"" Oliver said. ""We knew Strom Thurmond had proposed it. So we asked an archivist at the library where his papers are kept to go through the relevant papers, and they came up with nothing."" Oliver quipped about that lack of a paper trail, saying it might be the best scenario for Thurmond given his reputation for ""fervent racism."" Oliver enlivened his diatribe over Puerto Rico's dilemma with a rap performed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the son of Puerto Rican parents and the creator and star of the Broadway hit Hamilton. Miranda mentioned Thurmond, too: Somewhere down the line Strom Thurmond's ghost busted a cap  at a chance at Chapter 9. Which brings us to the focus of this fact-check: Did Thurmond propose the cunning words that ultimately caught Puerto Rico in a debtor’s vice? Thurmond’s role In a 2015 ruling, the judges of the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals provided some very helpful background. In March 1984, the House passed its version of a bankruptcy bill. That version did not have the Puerto Rico exemption. Then on May 21, 1984, the judges wrote that Thurmond introduced the package of changes that included the text at the center of this controversy. ""On the day that he introduced the amendment, Senator Thurmond addressed the Senate to explain several of its numerous stipulations, yet said little about the newly added Puerto Rico exemption,"" the judges wrote. In fact, we went through the Congressional Record for that day (thank you, Internet Archive). Thurmond said less than little. He said nothing. The record shows that after Thurmond’s amendment, the exemption became part of the final legislation. While this seems to point the finger at Thurmond, there’s more to this story.  Aside from introducing the overall amendment, Thurmond might not have had much to do with the text. It had been introduced four years before, and not in the Senate, but in the House. Congress’ earlier run at changing the law Experts question whether Thurmond actually understood the significance of the amendment. To see why, we have to go back to 1978. That year, Congress gave the bankruptcy law a complete overhaul. As often happens with major legislation, various gaps and ambiguities emerged and, in 1979, the Senate passed a bill to tidy up the loose ends. Among the dross, the Senate defined states to include Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and any territory or possession of the United States.   That legislation moved over to the House, and here the trail becomes murky. Bankruptcy law professor Stephen Lubben at Seton Hall University traced the twists and turns in a 2014 article. ""In July 1980, the House Judiciary Committee returned with an ‘amendment’ to the Senate bill that struck the entire Senate text and replaced it with the Judiciary Committee’s desired text, including a new definition of ‘state,’ "" Lubben wrote. The House version, under Democratic control, had the Chapter 9 bankruptcy exclusion for Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. That bill never passed, but in April 1981, Lubben found that the exclusion language ""resurfaced"" in the Senate.  ""This exclusion was never discussed by Congress, at least publicly, and the language apparently simply materialized as a result of the House Judiciary Committee’s extensive revision of the 1979 Senate ‘technical corrections’ bill,"" Lubben wrote. Lubben told us that the text in Thurmond’s 1984 amendment ""was essentially the same language that was kicking around since 1980."" ""It’s not even clear that the parties even understood what was going on,"" Lubben said. ""The only thing we can say for certain is the change happened without a whole lot of thought behind it."" Another factor makes it hard to find Thurmond’s fingerprints on the text that beleaguers Puerto Rico today. The change was never offered as a stand-alone item. It was always bundled with a number of other small changes. Law professor John Pottow at the University of Michigan told us, ""Strom Thurmond might have introduced that, but it’s an overstatement to say he played a big role."" A final mystery — if you’ve followed the trail this far, you will notice that in 1984, the House version of the bill didn’t have the Puerto Rico exclusion. The logical question is, why was it dropped when the House was the first to add it in 1980? We wish we knew. Our ruling Oliver said ""we know that Thurmond proposed"" the text that stripped Puerto Rico of the right to let municipalities and public utilities declare bankruptcy. There is no question that Thurmond introduced the amendment with that change. So technically, he did propose it. But there’s no evidence that he came up with the idea, and experts question that he understood the significance of the change that would follow. The statement is accurate but requires some additional information. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/260b6aad-f921-45fc-9937-1d82d35f7874 This fact-check previously contained erroneous references about the timing of Strom Thurmond's Senate career and Lin-Manuel Miranda's birthplace.",/factchecks/2016/apr/27/john-oliver/mystery-strom-thurmond-puerto-rico-and-bankruptcy-/

Has Barack Obama had a 'no boots on the ground' message for Syria?
","On April 25, 2016, President Barack Obama announced that he would be sending an additional 250 special-operations troops to Syria to counter the Islamic extremist group variously known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. ""Just as I approved additional support for Iraqi forces against ISIL, I've decided to increase U.S. support for local forces fighting ISIL in Syria, a small number of special operations forces are already on the ground in Syria and their expertise has been critical as local forces have driven ISIL out of key areas,"" Obama said. This development produced a testy exchange between journalists and State Department spokesman John Kirby at a briefing later that day. Matt Lee of the Associated Press peppered Kirby with questions about whether the expansion of U.S. forces conflicted with Obama’s past pledges to keep U.S. ""boots"" off the ground in Syria. Kirby said the 50 special operations forces that had already been on the ground ""have had a positive impact on our ability to go after Daesh inside Syria. And because it has been successful, we want to intensify. I've stood up here I don't know for how many weeks and talked about the fact that we want to intensify our efforts against Daesh. This is a process which has worked, so the President has decided to increase it to the tune of 250. And there was never this, ‘No boots on the ground.’ I don't know where this keeps coming from."" Then Kirby and Lee exchanged disagreements: Lee: ""The point is is that for months and months and months the mantra from the president and everyone else in the administration has been, ‘No boots on the ground.’ And now…"" Kirby: ""No, that is not true."" Lee: ""What?"" Kirby: ""It's just not true, Matt."" Eventually, Kirby explained why he believed Obama’s past rhetoric is consistent with the new influx of special operations forces. ""When we talk about boots on the ground in the context that you have heard people in the administration speak to, we are talking about conventional, large-scale ground troops that are designed to actually engage in, plan, coordinate, integrate, and engage in combat operations on the ground as units,"" Kirby said. ""We're not doing that. We've never done that in Iraq or in Syria, and we're not going to do it now."" In a moment, we’ll get to the substance of how one defines ""boots on the ground."" First, though, we wondered about the accuracy of Kirby’s repeated claim that ""there was never this (message), ‘No boots on the ground’ "" from Obama. What has Obama said? Obama has certainly used the phrase ""no boots on the ground"" frequently. On Oct. 31, 2015, USA Today’s Gregory Korte produced a detailed accounting of his comments on the matter headlined, ""16 times Obama said there would be no boots on the ground in Syria."" We reviewed the 16 examples Korte tracked down and found that in half of them, Obama did provide a fairly thorough set of limitations along the lines of what Kirby cited. For instance, in an address to the nation about Syria on Sept. 10, 2014, Obama said, ""I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. This counterterrorism campaign will be waged through a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist, using our air power and our support for partner forces on the ground."" But the other eight examples outlined in USA Today are phrased in such a way that plays up the ""no boots on the ground"" idea to such an extent that we think a reasonable person would be tempted to downplay or ignore the caveats. For instance, in a statement before meeting with congressional leaders on Sept. 3, 2013, Obama said, ""The key point that I want to emphasize to the American people: The military plan that has been developed by our Joint Chiefs, and that I believe is appropriate, is proportional. It is limited. It does not involve boots on the ground. This is not Iraq, and this is not Afghanistan."" In an earlier address to the nation on Sept. 10, 2013, Obama said, ""Many of you have asked, won't this put us on a slippery slope to another war? One man wrote to me that we are 'still recovering from our involvement in Iraq.' A veteran put it more bluntly: 'This nation is sick and tired of war.' My answer is simple: I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria. I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan. I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo. This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective: deterring the use of chemical weapons and degrading Assad's capabilities."" That address followed an interview with the PBS Newshour the night before in which Obama said, ""Tomorrow I'll speak to the American people. I'll explain this is not Iraq; this is not Afghanistan; this is not even Libya. We're not talking about — not boots on the ground. We're not talking about sustained airstrikes. We're talking about a very specific set of strikes to degrade his chemical weapons capabilities in terms of delivery."" When we reached out to the White House, they noted that the Syrian conflict at the time of these last two examples was focused on Syria’s chemical-weapons stockpile, rather than ISIS. They also argued that Obama’s main point was that the mission to counter ISIS would be different than the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq which involved more than 100,000 combat troops at a time -- a far larger fighting force than what is being used to target ISIS. Still, we think that the existence of between eight and 16 examples of the ""no boots on the ground"" phrasing -- sometimes with limitations emphasized, sometimes not -- qualifies as an ongoing ""message"" from Obama, contrary what Kirby said. ""Obama has a credibility gap on this front,"" said John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org. ""They use the same size body bag for all U.S. troops."" What does ‘boots on the ground’ mean? When we checked with international-affairs experts, several agreed that Kirby does have a point that there are legitimate differences between a large combat force and a modest number of special operations forces. ""Politicians who say there will be ‘no boots on the ground’ usually attach a caveat, and if they don’t do so verbally, they seem to attach it mentally,"" said Ted Bromund, senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""The caveat is that forces that the politician wishes to employ don’t count as boots on the ground -- which lets them use advisers, special forces, base protection, air power, logistics and supply, and so on to their heart’s content."" The risk, Bromund said, comes when someone calls them on it -- as Lee did -- or when the number of forces becomes ""so large, so controversial, or so obviously involved in combat that the claim comes into question."" What’s unusual in this case, he said, is that Kirby denied that the claim was ever made. Benjamin Friedman, a defense specialist at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the administration could have articulated itself more clearly. Still, he said that the bigger problem is that the administration is ""manipulating language to paper over a contradiction. They want ground forces in Syria and Iraq -- special operations forces are ground forces -- and want credit for not sending in ground forces. By saying no ‘boots on the ground,’ whatever caveats you include, you imply that our guys aren’t there getting shot at. But they are. So there’s a fundamental dishonesty there, despite the lawyerly definitional game they’re playing to avoid outright lying."" Bromund and Friedman consider this a significant concern. But Michael O’Hanlon, of the Brookings Institution, said he cuts Obama some slack on the language. O’Hanlon said the president’s ""obligation is to protect us, not win a contest for perfect semantic consistency. I would rather see slight inconsistencies than dogmatic and stubborn adherence to a soundbite."" Our ruling Kirby said that Obama never said, ""No boots on the ground"" in Syria. We accept that there are legitimate reasons for differentiating between a large ground force and a smaller number of special operations forces. Still, it’s clear that Obama repeatedly used the term ""no boots on the ground,"" sometimes with extensive caveats about what constituted ""boots on the ground"" and sometimes not. And by repeatedly using that phrase, he reaped the benefits of calming the public about the extent of U.S. involvement. That counts as a message to us. We rate the claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6cced0f1-3015-4b14-880b-97bc65556998",/factchecks/2016/apr/27/john-kirby/has-barack-obama-had-no-boots-ground-message-syria/

Super PAC's $1 trillion tax claim against Hillary Clinton ignores timeframe, who would pay
","The day before the April 26 primaries in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, the John Kasich super PAC New Day for America was making calls to would-be voters featuring the recorded voice of Michael Reagan, a political consultant and son of former President Ronald Reagan. His claim about Hillary Clinton caught our ear. ""Polls show Kasich's the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton in the fall. Trump loses. Cruz loses. And Kasich wins in a landslide. Isn't that what this race for president is really about? Becoming president? And if we don't win in November, Hillary Clinton has promised to raise taxes by $1 trillion dollars,"" Reagan says. To put that number in perspective, the national debt has reached nearly $19.2 trillion, or more than $60,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States.  PolitiFact has looked at the presidential candidates' tax plans and, for the Clinton proposal, we relied on a March 3, 2016, analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. The center says that Clinton's proposal would indeed increase tax revenue by $1 trillion — $1.1 trillion in fact. But that money would be raised over 10 years. Clinton, even if she were elected in November and reelected in 2020, wouldn't be in office that long. Reagan's message on behalf of New Day misses another point that may make the increase less onerous to most voters: ""Nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes,"" according to the report. For example, filers with an adjusted gross income higher than $1 million would have to pay an effective tax rate of 30 percent. Any money earned above $5 million per year would be assessed an extra 4 percent surcharge. (The surcharge would kick in at $2.5 million for married couples filing separately.) Clinton's plan also aims to discourage multinational corporations from using various schemes to lower or eliminate the taxes they have to pay in the United States. However, according to the report, her proposal would make the tax code more complex and the higher tax rates for the people who earn the most money would reduce ""incentives to work, save and invest."" When we heard back from New Day for America, spokeswoman Connie Wehrkamp directed us to Clinton's interview with the New York Daily News and an analysis by the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, both of which make it clear that the $1 trillion would be raised over 10 years, a distinction made by neither New Day nor Reagan. ""Liberals may think increasing taxes by $1 trillion is a good idea, but we very strongly disagree,"" Wehrkamp said in an email. Our ruling New Day spokesman Reagan said, ""Hillary Clinton has promised to raise taxes by $1 trillion."" Her plan does, in fact, call for raising a trillion dollars, but it would do so over 10 years — longer than she could serve as president, even if she were re-elected. So if she brought in roughly $100 billion per year, even a two-term Clinton administration couldn't fulfill a promise to bring the total to $1 trillion. Also, the statement ignores another key bit of data — that the money would be raised by tax changes targeted to the richest Americans, a group that has seen its top tax rate drop dramatically since the 1950s and early 1960s, when the marginal tax rate was over 90 percent.

NH Democrat says popular political stop is infested with rats
","In a case of Democrat backbiting, congressional candidate Shawn O’Connor says a popular New Hampshire restaurant, known for its chicken tenders and visits from presidential candidates, is full of rodents. It’s one of the latest accusations to fly in the Democratic race for the New Hampshire’s first congressional district. O’Connor is running in the primary against Carol Shea Porter, who has previously held the seat.   Of late, both the state Democratic party and O’Connor have accused the other of making false claims. O’Connor put out a statement claiming a Democratic state senator told others that he -- O’Connor -- planned to place rats into the kitchen of the Puritan Backroom restaurant in Manchester. O’Connor denies the allegation. ""Furthermore, a simple review of the Backroom’s health code records will reveal that the restaurant already has a long-standing problem with rodent infestations,"" O’Connor, a businessman from Bedford, wrote in a widely circulated statement on Monday, April 25, 2016. Is there any truth to this claim? O’Connor’s spokesman Logan Barbosa pointed us to the Manchester Department of Health website, which posts city restaurant inspections. Barbosa said the Puritan Backroom has been cited for ""critical item violation #35 (defined as found to have insects or rodents, or areas were identified that would allow the entry of rodents or insects)."" There’s a big difference between having rodents, and having areas that would allow their entry. Let’s take a look. Under city ordinance, restaurants are inspected twice a year. A decade’s worth of inspection records for the Puritan Backroom, a sit-down restaurant that also has an ice-cream window, are available on the Manchester city website. In nine of the 18 inspections since 2006, including the four most recent, the restaurant has had ""no critical violations observed,"" records show. The restaurant was most recently cited in 2013, but for food temperature issues. Over the last decade, records show the Puritan Backroom has never been cited for evidence of rodents on the premises or for any infestation. The restaurant was cited in 2011 and 2007 for an ""outer openings"" violation, which falls under the critical item violation #35. In 2011, inspectors noted the ""facilities outer openings have not been tightly sealed to the outside to prevent the entry of pests."" In 2007, inspectors recommended the restaurant install new weather stripping on the rear door, according to Phil Alexakos, Manchester’s Chief of Environmental Health, who oversees inspections. Neither situation meant the restaurant had pests, Alexakos said. ""If these gaps aren’t repaired, it could introduce pests,"" he said. The city’s public health department hasn’t received any complaints about rodents at the facility, according to Alexakos. Officials have never noted the presence of rodents on site, inspection records show. Restaurant president Arthur Pappas -- who co-owns the Puritan Backroom with son Democratic Executive Councilor Chris Pappas -- disputes the claim.   ""It is absolutely untrue,"" Arthur Pappas said. ""Anybody who has been in my kitchen knows there has never been a problem."" Our ruling  O’Connor said the Puritan Backroom restaurant has a ""long-standing problem with rodent infestations.""   Inspection records from the last decade show officials have never noted rodents inside the restaurant. While more than five years ago inspectors noted gaps where pests could potentially enter the restaurant, none have been documented inside over the last ten years. That's a far cry from a long-standing infestation.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2016/apr/27/shawn-oconnor/nh-democrat-says-popular-political-stop-infested-r/

Arizona congressman claims almost half of all African-American babies are killed by abortion
","U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., has been active in the nation’s capital recently, lobbying for legislation he introduced that would ban abortions based on race or gender. Critics say the proposed ban is ""stereotyping,"" as women seek abortions for a multitude of reasons, such as financial constraints. Franks presented a series of abortion statistics at an April 14 House subcommittee hearing on the legislation, called the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act, or PRENDA. ""Today in America, between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies, virtually 1-in-2 are killed before they are born, which is a greater cause of death for African-Americans than heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS and violence combined,"" Franks said. The congressman’s matter-of-fact claim intrigued us, so we decided to check it out. Limited data Franks’ spokeswoman, Destiny Edwards, referenced multiple reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, for his claim. Because Franks is talking specifically about abortion, we did not account for babies who may die as a result of domestic violence, for example, before birth. Guttmacher notes that African-American women accounted for an estimated 37 percent of the 1.21 million total abortions performed in 2008. That would in theory translate to 447,700 abortions. That same year, according to the CDC, 670,809 African-American babies were born. But Guttmacher’s abortion data is based on surveys with women and abortion providers. It is not a complete picture. Plus, total abortions dropped to about 1.06 million in 2011, but Guttmacher doesn’t have updated demographic breakdowns, Guttmacher Institute spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said. The CDC’s data is similarly imperfect. As we’ve noted in a previous abortion claim from PolitiFact Florida, the CDC does not have a complete record of abortions. Most states require hospitals, facilities and physicians to report all abortions to a central health agency.   But not every state reports this abortion data to the feds -- and they’re not required to either. The data also leaves out more than 20 states, including Arizona, California and Florida. According to the CDC’s 2012 data, the most recent available, the abortion ratio for non-Hispanic African-American women was 435 abortions per 1,000 African-American live births. But Nikki Mayes, a CDC spokeswoman, said that interpreting the ratio as a percent wouldn't be fair. Live births exclude stillbirths and miscarriages. According to the Mayo Clinic, 10 to 20 percent of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. The second half of Franks’ claim, comparing other causes of death, is even more complicated. CDC data is split among leading causes of death between African-American men and women. For African-American men, the leading causes of death are heart disease (24.1 percent), cancer (23.3 percent) and accidents (5.5 percent). Diabetes accounts for 3.9 percent of deaths and HIV, not AIDS, makes up 2.1 percent. For African-American women, it's heart disease (24.1 percent), cancer (22.6 percent) and stroke (6.4 percent). Diabetes among African-American women account for 4.6 percent of deaths, while accidents make up 2.8 percent of deaths.  Our ruling Franks said, ""Today in America, between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies, virtually 1-in-2 are killed before they are born."" Data suggests a disparity in the number of abortions performed on African-American women than other races. But saying that ""between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies"" are aborted goes beyond the limits of the data. Federal data doesn’t account for all 50 states, and fails to factor in pregnancies that end in a miscarriage. Private data is based on surveys and is years out of date. We rate Franks’ claim as Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/495aa314-3469-48b1-9c22-2a846a816891",/factchecks/2016/apr/26/trent-franks/arizona-congressman-claims-almost-half-all-african/

U.S. Rep. David Jolly says he voted against House Planned Parenthood investigation
","Seeking Marco Rubio’s soon-to-be-vacant Senate seat, U.S. Rep. David Jolly said during a debate in Orlando that he’s committed to sticking to conservative principles, even if it means voting against his own party. Jolly met with U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, at an Open Debate Coalition event on April 25, 2016, to discuss the Senate candidates’ platforms. After a question about whether he would support defending or defunding Planned Parenthood, Jolly said he opposed abortion and could not support the group, which has been under fire after being accused of selling fetal tissue. But he acknowledged other women’s health services deserved funding and decried government wasting too much time and money on attacking Planned Parenthood. ""When my side of the aisle asked for an investigation of Planned Parenthood, I actually voted no. I was the only Republican to vote no,"" he said. ""Should the issue be looked at? Yes. But there were already three committees looking at the issue. We didn’t need a fourth. We’re either going to be the party of less government or not."" Technically, the investigation Jolly is talking about doesn’t mention Planned Parenthood by name, but the Indian Shores Republican was the lone member of his party to oppose it. Copious committees The Republican-controlled House responded swiftly after the Center for Medical Progress released their heavily edited videos in July 2015 alleging Planned Parenthood sold fetal tissue after abortions.   The Energy and Commerce Committee, the Judiciary Committee and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee all announced investigations into the videos on July 15. (The Senate also prodded the Health and Human Services Department to open an investigation, as well.) Despite several hearings, including testimony from Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards, there was no proof the group broke the law, which allows for tissue donations for an unspecified procurement fee but not taxpayer funds for abortions. On Oct. 7, 2015, the House voted on HR 451, which created a select investigative panel ""for the purpose of investigating abortion practices and the handling of and policies regarding fetal tissue, its cost, and how it is obtained."" Planned Parenthood was not named in the resolution, but was clearly the target of the investigation. Jolly was the only Republican to go against his party in a 242-184 vote, with two Democrats voting for it. Jolly noted in a Facebook post after the vote that he did not believe the panel was necessary. ""We should always look to streamline government, not expand it. And the bottom line is today's decision unfortunately fails that most basic conservative principle,"" he said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. ""Simply put, because three panels currently have jurisdiction to investigate, we do not need to create a fourth."" We couldn’t find the post when we looked at Jolly’s Facebook timeline. His campaign directed us to a similarly worded Newsmax article Jolly wrote on Oct. 14, 2015. The article highlighted legislation Jolly introduced ""to fully defund taxpayer support for Planned Parenthood until a thorough investigation is completed, and instead transfer that funding to other providers of critical non-abortion women's healthcare in underserved communities."" Investigations by 12 state governments did not find any evidence of fetal tissue sales, although a grand jury in Texas in February 2016 did indict David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, who made the videos. They both face charges of tampering with a government record, while Center for Medical Progress founder Daleiden was charged with prohibition of the purchase and sale of human organs. The panel the House created in October, the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, has held hearings but has not yet asked Daleiden to testify. Our ruling Jolly said he ""was the only Republican"" to vote against creating a House panel to investigate Planned Parenthood. The reason he voted no, he said, is because the House already had three investigations into Planned Parenthood’s alleged sale of fetal tissue. Jolly made it clear at the time he was not in favor of spending more taxpayer dollars to investigate something already under the microscope.

Viral Facebook claim about Target adding urinals to women’s restroom is Pants On Fire
","Has Target added urinals to a women’s restroom in California? That’s the claim in a Facebook post that’s been shared more than 14,000 times as of April 26, 2016, one week after the mega-retailer announced transgender customers are welcome to use bathrooms that match up with their gender identity at their stores nationwide. Target is the latest corporation to announce the policy, just as state legislatures have debated or approved so-called ""bathroom laws."" Those laws, including one signed by the governor of North Carolina in late March, would prohibit transgender people from using restrooms that do not correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificate. Target’s policy has led to mixed customer reviews. Some have cheered it, while more than half a million people had signed a boycott petition by American Family Association, a conservative Christian activist group, as of Tuesday. The group contends the policy encourages sexual predators and puts women and young girls in danger. We know the policy alone is controversial. But we wondered whether Target had taken its stance to an even more contentious level by installing urinals in a women’s store restroom? That’s the claim in the popular Facebook post by a user named Kathleen Crawford: ""It's true. ..I'm in the women's bathroom at a Target north of LA...they actually took out a stall for women in order to accommodate the ones who have giblets...yes, these are urinals...for men...and so the war on women progresses. …"" The allegation inspired outrage on some conservative blogs, where it was taken as fact. It shouldn’t be. Our research The Facebook post includes a photo of two urinals wrapped in plastic inside a restroom with a red wall. It shows no evidence of where, exactly, the photo was taken. When we contacted Target, a corporate spokeswoman called the claim on Facebook ""inaccurate."" ""We have not made any changes to the restrooms,"" the spokeswoman, Molly Snyder, said in an email. ""We have not added any urinals to any women's restrooms nor do we have any plans to do so."" She said the company never had past plans to do so. So what’s going on with the photo? It’s hard to say for certain. We reached out to the person who posted it on Facebook, but we haven’t heard back. The myth-busting website Snopes.com also checked out the Facebook post and found it False. It said the ""picture has nothing to do with Target's restroom policy. The image was not taken in a women's restroom at a Los Angeles Target store (rather a men's room that was undergoing repair or refurbishment)."" Snopes.com did not say how it found out where the photo came from. Snyder, the Target spokeswoman, said she did not know its source. If Target had made this change, we’d expect more than just one photo to surface. We reached out to the woman on Facebook, and we'll add her response should we hear back. Our ruling A popular Facebook post alleged last week that Target installed urinals in a women’s restroom in California. Target representatives told us the claim is ""inaccurate,"" and that the company has no plans to change its restrooms, and never did. Best we can tell, the Facebook post is a one-off picture that hasn’t surfaced in any other form (other than the thousands of people sharing it). So stop that!

Hillary Clinton's hazy claim that researchers can't study marijuana
","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton doesn’t have a firm stance on marijuana legalization yet — she wants to see more research first. But there are some challenges to getting that research, she said. At an ABC town hall April 21, Clinton told audience member Evan Nison, a National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws board member, what she would do as president to address the marijuana legalization debate. ""I've said I want to move marijuana off of Schedule I, which you understand means that you can't do any research about it,"" she said. ""You can't do anything, and I think that's wrong. We have enough anecdotal evidence, as you well know being a member of the NORML Board, about what marijuana can do for medical conditions, easing pain. And we need to be doing research on it because I am 100 percent in favor of medical uses for marijuana. But I want to know what the evidence is."" The 1970 Controlled Substances Act classified marijuana as a Schedule I drug, a category that includes drugs with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This puts marijuana in the same class as heroin and ecstasy and a notch higher than meth and cocaine. We wondered if Clinton was correct that marijuana’s Schedule I classification means scientists can’t research it. (Hat-tip to our buds at FactCheck.org who looked at her claim first.) We talked to some scientists who do, in fact, research marijuana. The regulatory hoops make their work challenging but not impossible. Stuck in the weeds The government doesn’t ban scientific research on Schedule I drugs like marijuana. In 2015, the National Institutes of Health put approximately $111 million into 281 research projects studying cannabinoids, which are chemical compounds found in marijuana. (Not all of these studies actually involve giving marijuana to human subjects.) But the government has tried to make it harder to study marijuana and other drugs it has historically considered dangerous and without medical use, for fear that the drugs could be stolen or fall into the wrong hands, said John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert in federal marijuana policy. ""Marijuana has always been treated most unique among scheduled drugs in ways that made it even harder to study,"" especially in terms of acquiring plants for the research, Hudak told PolitiFact. As a result, in many states where medical marijuana is legal, doctors and policymakers have to base their practices on limited science, Hudak and co-author Grace Wallack wrote in a Brookings report. He cited research that found Schedule I designations discourage scientists from trying to study these drugs. To conduct marijuana research, researchers have to submit an investigational new drug application to the Food and Drug Administration, and the Drug Enforcement Administration has to license the research site and the investigating scientist. If a scientist wanted to conduct three studies on a non-Schedule I drug in three different labs, he or she could get an umbrella approval for this project. But to conduct a similar set of studies on a Schedule I drug such as marijuana, the researcher would have to get approval for each individual site and investigator, said Igor Grant, director of the Center for Medical Cannabis Research at the University of California, San Diego. Until about a year ago, a Public Health Service committee also had to review privately funded projects, in a process almost identical to the FDA review. But President Barack Obama’s administration did away with that requirement. Grant, whose lab has completed seven studies on medical uses for cannabis, said that before this revision, it could take between six and 18 months to get all the necessary government approvals to start a study. Now, it takes a little less time. The supply of federally approved marijuana plants is another major barrier. If researchers want to use the marijuana plant, there is only one source: the University of Mississippi, which contracts with the National Institute of Drug Abuse to grow marijuana for research purposes. So researchers can only get however much marijuana the facility is able to produce, and they’re subject to the facility’s timeline. The program has good intentions in providing drugs that might otherwise be difficult to work with, and they can control the chemical makeup of the plant, said Christine Rabinak, a pharmacy and neuroscience professor at Wayne State University. But there are some concerns about how well the government’s supply matches the kind of marijuana that is currently commercially available for medicinal purposes. ""I think we are going to be limited on what research can be conducted in the United States with other strains of cannabis because of these federal barriers,"" she said. Some researchers, including Rabinak, use synthetic versions of chemical compounds found in marijuana, which she said are much easier to acquire than the plant itself. Grant said that if the government were to reschedule marijuana to a lower classification, there would likely be more marijuana research because the project review process would be so much easier. It would especially open up opportunities for scientists who might not have the time or resources to spend months waiting for federal approval under the current rules. Hudak’s Brookings paper concluded that rescheduling marijuana would remove one hurdle for researchers, while also recommending lifting the federal government’s control over growing marijuana plants for research and reforming licensing requirements, among other policy changes. While Clinton’ statement is incorrect, there’s some truth to her larger point that current policy makes it hard to research marijuana, Grant said. ""It does not mean the studies cannot be done or that the federal government is consciously trying to block the studies,"" he said. ""It’s just a complicated process."" Our ruling Clinton said marijuana is a Schedule I drug, ""which you understand means that you can’t do any research about it."" It’s hard to research marijuana, especially using plants (as opposed to synthetic versions) in studies involving human subjects. There are many regulatory hoops scientists have to navigate, and the government has a single-source monopoly on marijuana plants to be used for research. All of this makes setting up a marijuana experiment a lengthy and daunting process. However, there are scientists currently studying marijuana, and federal funding supports some of these experiments. Clinton’s statement gives the impression that the government bans marijuana research flat-out, and that’s not the case. Her statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/apr/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-hazy-claim-researchers-cant-study/

Paris Agreement sees largest number of countries to sign on during any single day
","Using Earth Day as a backdrop on April 22, 2016, world leaders from 175 countries signed an historic agreement for climate change. Named for the city of Paris, the agreement was signed at the United Nations headquarters in New York. Senior adviser to President Barack Obama Brian Deese attempted put the agreement into perspective in a post on Medium: ""Today, on Earth Day, nearly 170 countries will sign the Paris Agreement, reinforcing their commitment to the historic climate pact that was forged in December of last year. That’s the largest number of countries that have ever signed an international agreement in one day."" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon made a similar claim on the same day. ""Today is an historic day,"" Ban told reporters at a press conference following the opening ceremony of the signing event in New York. ""This is by far the largest number of countries ever to sign an international agreement on a single day."" We wondered if Ban, and Deese were correct. The Paris Agreement was signed by leaders from 175 of the 193 countries in the United Nations. That is indeed a record, the United Nations confirmed. The previous benchmark was in 1982. ""In 1982, 119 countries signed the Law of the Sea Treaty. That was the record until Friday,"" said Stéphane Dujarric, a United Nations spokesman. The Law of the Sea Treaty called for technology transfers and wealth transfers from developed to undeveloped nations. It also required parties to the treaty to adopt regulations and laws to control pollution of the marine environment. There are a few caveats worth mentioning. First, signing the agreement is not the end. The leaders must now go back to their home countries' governments to ratify and approve the agreement, which could take months or years. Fifteen countries ratified the agreement immediately -- Barbados, Belize, Fiji, Grenada, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Somalia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, State of Palestine and Tuvalu. Second, the record should be put into perspective. There are both more countries and more members of the United Nations today than ever.  Until now, the 1987 Montreal Protocol was regarded as one of the most successful international treaties of all time. It was the first treaty in history to achieve universal ratification. It is has been ratified by every member of the United Nations and was ratified by 197 governments. This protocol deals with the protection of the Earth’s fragile ozone layer. This layer protects life on Earth from some of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays -- and, thanks to the treaty, is set to recover completely by around 2050. But the Montreal Protocol initially was signed by just 46 governments. The Paris Agreement goes into effect once 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions formally ratify the agreement. Among other things, the agreement proposes: a  long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels; to aim to limit the increase to 1.5°C; reduce the amount of global emissions, recognizing that the process will take longer in developing countries. Our ruling Ban said, the Paris Agreement ""is by far the largest number of countries ever to sign an international agreement on a single day."" That is correct, beating the previous record when 119 countries simultaneously signed the Law of the Sea Treaty in 1982. But there are two caveats. First, Signing does not equal ratification. Countries must still do that before the agreement takes effect. Second, it’s worth noting there are more independent nations today to sign an agreement than in year’s past. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/apr/26/ban-ki-moon/paris-agreement-sees-largest-number-countries-sign/

Online petition urges Sherwin-Williams to stop making lead paint
","Protesters demonstrated in front of the Cleveland headquarters of Sherwin-Williams on April 20, coinciding with the paint manufacturer’s annual shareholders’ meeting. ""Covering the world with LEAD PAINT,"" one banner read. Months earlier, Occupational Knowledge International, a nongovernmental agency based in San Francisco, posted a Change.org petition calling on Sherwin-Williams and another paint company, PPG Industries, to stop using lead in their products. The headline to the petition reads, ""Stop making lead paint and poisoning people around the world!"" But the use of lead-based paint has been banned in the United States since 1978 because the element is a poisonous neurotoxin. It’s especially harmful to children, even at tiny levels of exposure. Could a U.S. company still be making paint containing lead? Unleaded, please The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency enforces the rules against lead-based paint. Because many pre-1978 homes and buildings still contain lead paint, the EPA also cracks down on improper renovation and demolition activity, because inadequate abatement can release lead particles into the air, soil and water.  But the executive director of Occupational Knowledge International, Perry Gottesfeld, says American firms still make paint with lead. Reports suggest that global lead production is up more than 70 percent. The petition is aimed at protecting consumers around the world -- Occupational Knowledge International says that 2.5 billion people live in countries where lead paint is still sold for residential use. Many countries don’t have regulations concerning lead in paint. A 2014 article in the National Institute of Health’s publication, Environmental Health Perspectives, charts 40 countries worldwide where decorative paint containing lead is still sold. Sherwin-Williams director of corporate communications, Mike Conway, said the company does not produce lead-based paint intended for residential use anywhere in the world. That’s accurate. But Sherwin-Williams does have 16 licensees who produce and sell Sherwin-Williams branded paint overseas, in places like Haiti, Indonesia, Thailand, El Salvador, Peru, and Guatemala. Those licensees control what’s in their product, and sign agreements that their formulas will not contain lead, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer.   And in 2015, the Plain Dealer reported that ""researchers from the University of Cincinnati and IPEN, an international non-governmental organization network, found lead at 360 times the acceptable limits in the Dutch Boy residential paint produced and sold by one of those licensees, Lebanon-based ChemiPaint."" ""We had one isolated case in Lebanon with a licensee who received a contaminated raw material from a Chinese supplier,"" Conway told PolitiFact. ""When he mixed it into the batch, that caused the lead level to rise. We responded immediately and made sure they rectified the problem. No issues since then."" Why lead in the first place If the downside is that it’s a poison, what’s the upside to using lead in paint? Tami Lasseter Clare, an associate professor of chemistry at Portland State University, said that it comes down to durability and cost. ""Paint is composed of two things, the pigment and the binder,"" Clare said. ""The pigment is the thing that gives it color and opacity, and the binder is the glue that sticks the pigment particles together."" When lead is in its basic form, lead carbonate, it is a white mineral, making it a good pigment. But other stuff is white too, like zinc oxide, the white stuff in sunscreen, or titanium dioxide. Zinc is not as good at covering and hiding surfaces, Clare said, so titanium dioxide has become the main lead alternative.   Titanium dioxide has hiding power, but the downside is its price, which fluctuates like crazy. ""Major paint companies may be motivated to move away from materials having volatile prices to give better profit predictability,"" Clare said. But litigation is costly, too. In 2014, a judge in California ordered Sherwin-Williams and two other paint manufacturers to pay $1.15 billion into a fund for lead abatement, ruling that the companies created a public nuisance by promoting the use of lead paint in homes prior to 1978, while knowing the dangers it posed. The decision contained an excerpt from a Sherwin-Williams publication from 1900 that read, ""It is also familiarly known that white lead is a deadly cumulative poison, while zinc white is innocuous. It is true, therefore, that any paint is poisonous in proportion to the percentage of lead contained in it."" The World Health Organization joined with the United Nations Environment Programme to form the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint. Its objective is ""to promote a phase-out of the manufacture and sale of paints containing lead."" Conway, Sherwin-Williams’ spokesman, told PolitiFact Ohio that the company supports the global lead alliance program to eliminate lead in paint. The lead alliance’s goal for phasing out lead is gradual, and its first priority is to convince industry partners to stop using lead in decorative and residential paints that consumers buy off the shelf. There's another wrinkle to the paint debate.  Sherwin-Williams also makes industrial coatings that are intended to be used only on outdoor metal surfaces such as cars and bridges. Sherwin-Williams does make industrial paint products that contain lead.  Conway said the practice is not only legal but can be necessary to protect against corrosion. Gottesfeld wrote in Front Public Health that there are safer alternatives available for companies like Sherwin-Williams to use. The other paint manufacturer named in the petition, PPG International, held its shareholder meeting April 21, 2016, and the company’s CEO announced plans to eliminate lead from all PPG products by 2020. Our ruling Occupational Knowledge International, a group dedicated to eliminating lead paint, posted a petition on Change.org that says Sherwin-Williams is ""making lead paint and poisoning people around the world."" There is some truth to the claim but also some spin. Sherwin-Williams continues to make industrial paint products that contain lead, but those paints are exempt from the U.S. lead ban. Sherwin-Williams does not directly make or directly sell residential paint products that contain lead, but they have licensees who might. In one case, in Lebanon, Sherwin-Williams acknowledged a mistake that allowed lead into a residential paint product. Occupational Knowledge International’s claim about Sherwin-Williams is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. Clarification April 26: This story has been updated to clarify differences between paints intended for residential and industrial use, as well as the source of the claim that global lead paint production is up 70 percent.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/01dd996a-61d3-4bee-9b14-9bb7c1e25372",/factchecks/2016/apr/26/occupational-knowledge-international/online-petition-urges-sherwin-williams-stop-making/

Moderates warn that supporting progressive policies will lead to more members losing their seats, while progressives say the party’s base should be embraced.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Queens, said in an interview that House Democrats in swing districts who supported ""Medicare for All"" won re-election, without exception.  ""Every single swing-seat House Democrat who endorsed #MedicareForAll won re-election or is on track to win re-election. Every. Single. One,"" she tweeted.  Every single swing-seat House Democrat who endorsed #MedicareForAll won re-election or is on track to win re-election.Every.👏🏽 Single.👏🏽 One.👏🏽 Her claim gained traction on Twitter, and a reader asked us to look into it.  Generally, swing seats are competitive House districts that can ""swing"" between Democratic and Republican control. Different organizations may rate different seats as competitive, but the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan political analysis organization, is a highly regarded and commonly cited source. In its final Nov. 2 House race ratings, Cook listed 23 swing seats held by Democratic incumbents who were seeking re-election as ""toss up"" or ""leans Democratic."" Of those 23, two incumbents - Reps. Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania and Peter DeFazio of Oregon - co-sponsored a bill providing Medicare for All. Those two won.  Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign, when we asked for evidence of her claim, provided a longer list of House Democrats that it said were in competitive races. Its list included Reps. Mike Levin and Katie Porter of California, Susan Wild of Pennsylvania and Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona, all co-sponsors of H.R. 1384, the Medicare for All Act of 2019. Levin, Porter and Wild won seats in historically Republican districts in 2018. Kirkpatrick won in 2018 in a district that has historically swung between the parties. But the Cook Report rated Wild's seat ""likely Democratic,"" and the other seats solid Democratic.  We approached the University of Virginia Center for Politics about this claim, and it sent us an analysis of 2018 races, in which political scientist Alan I. Abramowitz found support for Medicare for All was a ""vote loser"" in U.S. House races.  The Ocasio-Cortez campaign also sent a list of eight members who did not co-sponsor H.R. 1384 and are in competitive districts and lost. It doesn’t directly address the claim we are fact-checking here.   Ocasio-Cortez said that every House Democrat in a swing seat who supports Medicare for All won their race.  Ocasio-Cortez's statement is true as far as it goes, but it leaves a misleading impression. Only two of the 23 Democratic incumbents running for re-election whose races the Cook Political Report rated as ""toss-up"" or ""lean Democratic"" had signed on as co-sponsors of the bill. We rate her statement Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2020/nov/17/alexandria-ocasio-cortez/medicare-all-supporters-win-swing-districts/

No, US military did not raid election software company tied to Dominion
","Voting equipment company Dominion Voting Systems has been at the center of unfounded conspiracy theories — many spread by President Donald Trump — that claim Democrats committed voter fraud and stole the 2020 election for Joe Biden. There’s no evidence that Dominion’s systems were used nefariously in the election, but false claims about the company keep coming.  Posts circulating online claim that the U.S. military raided the Spanish election software company Scytl in Germany and seized its servers for evidence of manipulation in the 2020 U.S. elections. Some posts claim the servers have ties to Dominion. This is false. Scytl said in a statement that the U.S. military hasn’t seized anything and that it doesn’t have offices in Germany. The U.S. Army, which was identified in some posts as the military branch supposedly involved, denied to the Associated Press that such an event took place.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The rumor was fueled by an article on a website called ""GreatGameIndia"" titled ""INTEL: US Military Raided Scytl Servers in Germany For Evidence After Vote Switching Scandal."" It said, ""votes cast by Americans in 2020 US election were counted by a bankrupt Spanish company Scytl in Spain."" The story pointed to comments made by U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, who appeared on conservative TV channel Newsmax. A clip of the interview shows Gohmert saying that he was told there was ""a tweet in German from Germany that the U.S. Army had gone in and seized the Syctl server."" The clip’s description on YouTube reads: ""People on the ground in Germany report that Scytl, which hosting YOUR elections data Improperly through Spain, was raided by a large US ARMY force & their Servers were Seized in Frankfurt."" An Army spokesperson told the AP over the weekend that the claims in the posts are false.  Scytl, a software company based in Barcelona, has eight offices around the world but none in Germany, according to its website. It has delivered election modernization projects for U.S. elections since 2008.  But none of these projects involve tallying votes, the company said. The services include online initiatives like election worker training, electronic ballot delivery and real-time, visual representation of votes.  In a statement rejecting the claims, Scytl said that its technologies for the U.S. are hosted and managed domestically by a Tampa-based subsidiary, SOE Software, and that it does not provide any voting machines in the U.S. or online voting services for U.S. elections. ""We do not have servers or offices in Frankfurt,"" the company added. ""The US army has not seized anything from Scytl in Barcelona, Frankfurt or anywhere else."" Scytl and Dominion share no ties, according to statements from both companies. The federal Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council said in a joint statement that the election was the most secure in U.S. history and that there is ""no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised."" Social media users are sharing articles and videos claiming that the U.S. military seized Scytl servers in Germany and that the company has ties to Dominion Voting Systems. The Army and Scytl said the claim is false, and the company has no offices in Germany or connection to Dominion.  We rate this Pants on Fire!

Yes, Department of Homeland Security declared Nov. 3 election most secure in American history
","As President Donald Trump continues to spread baseless claims of widespread fraud and a ""rigged"" presidential election that left him the loser to Democrat Joe Biden, others have come to the defense of the American election system. But does that group include officials in one of Trump’s own federal departments? That was the claim from U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, in a Nov. 15, 2020 appearance on WISN-TV’s ""UpFront"" program.  ""We heard from the Department of Homeland Security this week that this was probably the most secure election that’s ever been run in the United States,"" Baldwin said.  Is it true that some of the nation’s own top cybersecurity experts disagree with Trump? Yes. Let’s take a look.  On Nov. 12, 2020, officials from two Department of Homeland Security committees — the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council and the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council overseeing cybersecurity — released a joint statement debunking their own boss’s rampant misinformation campaign. ""The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history,"" the statement says.  It’s normal for states with close contests to launch ballot recounts to allow for correction of mistakes, the statement also says, but adds there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised.  ""While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too,"" the statement concludes. Trump has pointedly refused to concede to Biden, and his administration has blocked typical transition measures aimed at a smooth transfer of power. And on Nov. 17, Trump fired Christopher Krebs, the senior cybersecurity official responsible for securing the presidential election. Krebs, a Trump appointee, has been among the loudest voices rebutting false claims of election fraud. In a tweet firing Krebs, Trump said Krebs' statements have been ""highly inaccurate,"" reiterating allegations of voter fraud. His unsubstantiated claims of fraud have prompted several prominent Republicans to call for investigations into election proceedings, including in Wisconsin, where the GOP-controlled Legislature will launch a probe into the election, which went to Biden by about 20,000 votes. Trump has pledged to seek a recount in Wisconsin, though the top Republican in the Assembly has acknowledged it’s unlikely to change the outcome. The deadline to seek a recount — which election officials say could cost Trump’s campaign nearly $8 million — is Wednesday, Nov. 18. Baldwin claimed federal security officials called the Nov. 3, 2020 election the most secure in the country’s history.  She’s correct. The groups did so in direct conflict with what the president has been falsely claiming for weeks.  We rate Baldwin’s claim True.",/factchecks/2020/nov/17/tammy-baldwin/yes-department-homeland-security-declared-nov-3-el/

Photos show a Cleveland Cavaliers parade and the Women’s March — not the Million MAGA March
","What do the Women’s March, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Million MAGA March have in common? They’re all ingredients in a misleading Facebook post.

Some of the images are from a Cleveland Cavaliers parade in 2016 and the Women’s March in 2017.

No, there was nothing shady about the “lost” Milwaukee elections flash drive
","In an election season where President Donald Trump and his supporters are glomming onto any irregularity in hopes of justifying their voter fraud claims, the tale of one Milwaukee flash drive has drawn significant attention. Wisconsin has been labeled by some as the tipping point in the 2020 election. And the state swung at about 3:30 a.m. when the city of Milwaukee reported its absentee ballots — which leaned heavily to former Vice President Joe Biden. That has brought a lot of attention to the counting and reporting of those Milwaukee votes. Gateway Pundit — a far-right website peddling an onslaught of misinformation around Wisconsin and other key states — honed in on a flash drive used to transport votes between two locations on election night, serving up this headline on Nov. 13, 2020: ""Developing: Milwaukee Elections Chief Lost Elections Flash Drive in Morning Hours of November 4th When Democrats Miraculously Found 120,000 Votes for Joe Biden."" This article — widely shared on social media — was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).  The story rehashes several debunked claims, including that Democrats ""found"" ballots in Wisconsin overnight (they didn’t, this is just when Milwaukee finished counting absentee ballots) and that Milwaukee had an 89% turnout (it didn’t, this is shoddy math). But the core of the claim is that the head of the Milwaukee Election Commission lost a flash drive, which they say is shady and imply proves voter fraud. Neither element is remotely true. Let’s review how we got here. In pushing back against claims of voter fraud, election officials in Wisconsin and across the country have noted that human error happens. But it happens in observed, controlled environments in a system that is packed with redundancies and doublechecks to ensure those errors are caught and corrected. One such error occurred in Milwaukee. Wisconsin Right Now, a newly launched conservative news and opinion site, first reported on Nov. 6 that a flash drive containing Milwaukee votes had been ""briefly lost"" in the early morning hours of Nov. 4. The story added an air of controversy to the proceedings with this line: ""Sources tell Wisconsin Right Now that police on the scene were pressured to stay silent and that police felt threatened by district attorney investigators and election personnel, who were present during the incident and didn’t want them to tell anyone what happened."" This story was then picked up by The Gateway Pundit, which added in references to previously debunked voter claims and piling on additional assertions that Claire Woodall-Vogg, executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, was filmed ""feeding totals into a machine in the wee hours of the morning WITHOUT any election observers"" and ""purposely broke all protocol by transferring numbers to a flash drive."" These specific claims are 100% wrong, as is the underlying claim that anything in this circumstance is consistent with fraud. We know the story behind this incident because Woodall-Vogg detailed it in a Nov. 9 letter to the Wisconsin Election Commission seeking to set the record straight. She also filled in details in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. About 3 a.m. Nov. 4, Woodall-Vogg and other city election officials finished counting 170,000 absentee ballots and prepared to bring them to the Milwaukee County Election Commission. That meant putting a flash drive in each of the 12 tabulating machines — used to count ballots — to download the tallies. These tabulators are not able to connect to the internet to transmit totals directly, so flash drives have been used to transfer the data from the city’s central count location to the county commission since these machines went into service in 2015. Woodall-Vogg gathered the flash drives and went to the commission office — about a mile away — with a police escort, only to discover that she had left the flash drive for Tabulator 7 in the machine. She then called a member of her leadership team, who found the drive in the machine and gave it to a Milwaukee police officer to deliver. About 15 minutes passed from the time Woodall-Vogg realized the drive was missing to when it was delivered. Officials confirmed no changes were made to the drive, since the time stamp on the drive and tabulator confirm the downloaded file hadn’t been altered. And the flash drive’s detailed vote tallies matched those on the machine. In any case, there’s no reasonable way the drive could have been altered in that span, Woodall-Vogg said. ""The machine is not able to be accessed from a distance, so it seems completely unfeasible to think that someone would alter a flash drive’s results, which had between 12k-15k votes on it, but still maintain the vote counts by ward to be accurate,"" she said in an email. ""Staff were in the room (with the drive) the entire time, the live stream was still streaming, and the flash drive remained in the machine the entire time."" Woodall-Vogg also noted the two claims added by Gateway Pundit’s account are baseless. She wasn’t ""feeding totals into a machine,"" she was simply downloading results from the machine that ballots had been fed into throughout the day. And she didn’t break any protocol by transferring the numbers to the drive, she was following standard procedure since flash drives are required to get totals off the tabulator. Milwaukee uses DS450 and DS850 model tabulators, which don't have modems that allow direct connections to the Internet, Woodall-Vogg said in an email. And the fundamental claim that the drive is connected to the wee hours shift to Biden is ridiculous. That jump was both expected and legitimate, as it’s simply when officials finished counting Milwaukee’s absentee ballots.   Absentee ballots in Wisconsin were long expected to lean heavily Democratic, and Milwaukee as a whole is a longtime Democratic stronghold. What’s more, the totals and percentages were in line with past results. Biden picked up his winning margins in the suburbs and other parts of the state, not the city of Milwaukee itself. And we should note Republican lawmakers are the reason the absentee votes were reported so late. They refused to act on a request from a bipartisan group of local clerks that they be allowed to begin processing absentee ballots before Election Day. Milwaukee was one of 39 communities that set up a central count location, which is why the totals were reported together once the counting was complete. Reid Magney, spokesman for the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission, told Wisconsin Watch, ""We are confident that there are no issues with the election results in Milwaukee."" A website claims a lost flash drive in Milwaukee is connected to ""When Democrats Miraculously Found 120,000 Votes for Joe Biden."" The word ""flash drive"" is about the only truth in this claim. It’s a stretch to call it lost since it was under the supervision of election officials when it was unintentionally left behind. And it’s absurd to connect this flash drive to a jump in Biden votes. Those votes were from absentee ballots that were long expected to strongly favor Biden. We know the drive in question wasn’t altered since the timestamp on the data copied to it matched the original transfer, and the vote totals on it matched those recorded by the machine.

No, Biden's COVID-19 task force appointee didn't propose withholding food stamps
","As drugmakers get closer to vaccines for the novel coronavirus, posts online are claiming that a member of President-elect Joe Biden’s COVID-19 task force recommends withholding federal assistance from people who refuse to get vaccinated. One Instagram post shares the claim with a screenshot of a Nov. 12 article from a website called ""Distributed News."" Its headline reads:  ""VAX THE BLACKS: Joe Biden’s Covid-19 taskforce member recommends withholding food stamps and rent assistance from those who refuse coronavirus vaccines."" This is wrong. The post wildly mischaracterizes recommendations made over the summer by a working group of medical experts and scholars assembled by Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and Texas State University.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article identifies the task force member as Dr. Luciana Borio, an infectious disease physician and public health administrator who served in positions at the Food and Drug Administration and the National Security Council during the Obama and Trump administrations. Borio is a vice president at In-Q-Tel, a strategic investment company, and member of the working group of medical experts and scholars that published a report in July on readying populations for a COVID-19 vaccine. But none of the report’s recommendations say the government should withhold federal support programs like food stamps or rent assistance to people who refuse to get vaccinated for the virus. To the contrary, the document only mentions food stamps and rent assistance in the context of combining those services with a vaccine to make it more accessible for low-income and at-risk populations: ""Local and state public health agencies should explore collaboration with interagency and nongovernment partners to bundle vaccination with other safety net services. For example, the WIC nutrition program serves as a key mechanism for connecting low-income pregnant women with nutrition supports and clinical services, and immunization screenings and vaccine promotion are built into the WIC program. Bundling services (eg, food security, rent assistance, free clinic services) that are already being provided to particularly vulnerable populations in the context of COVID (eg, older adults, low-income adults, Black and minority communities) could be a way to build trust and streamline vaccine provision."" The report’s lead authors, Monica Schoch-Spana, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security; and Emily K. Brunson, an associate professor of anthropology at Texas State University, told PolitiFact that the Distributed News article contains factual inaccuracies and misleading statements.  ""We support voluntary vaccination during the pandemic, once safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available. We argue that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should NOT be mandated,""  Schoch-Spana and Brunson wrote in an emailed statement. ""We also take exception to the singling out and professional misrepresentation of Dr. Luciana Borio, an accomplished infectious disease physician who has expertise in medical countermeasures, including vaccines."" Schoch-Spana and Brunson wrote that the group supports efforts to make the vaccines readily available to everyone who wants one, including individuals with limited means. ""We support the provision of vaccinations alongside other services and goods that can help reduce the myriad burdens that the pandemic has placed upon individuals such as lost jobs, interrupted income, food insecurity, evictions, and foreclosures. We do NOT advocate that such social supports ever be withheld in connection with an individual’s vaccination status."" Social media posts cite an article as evidence that Dr. Luciana Borio, a member of Biden’s COVID-19 task force, recommended in a July report that the government withhold ""food stamps and rent assistance from those who refuse coronavirus vaccines.""

The ‘Million MAGA March’ did not have 1 million or more attendees
","The Trump administration is ending the same way it started: spreading false claims about crowd sizes in Washington, D.C. On Nov. 14, thousands of President Donald Trump’s supporters rallied in Washington to support false claims that he had won re-election. But White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweeted an alternative estimate of the demonstration’s attendance. ""AMAZING! More than one MILLION marchers for President @realDonaldTrump descend on the swamp in support,"" McEnany said in the tweet, which has been shared more than 56,000 times. The post took us back to January 2017, when Trump’s first press secretary, Sean Spicer, claimed the crowd at Trump’s inauguration ""was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period."" We rated that claim Pants on Fire! Since Trump retweeted a claim that more than a million people gathered in Washington to support him, we wanted to take a closer look at McEnany’s tweet. (Screenshot from Twitter) The claim is wrong. News outlets that covered the protests estimated that thousands, not more than 1 million, attended them. It’s mathematically impossible for more than 135,000 people to fit in the location that McEnany tweeted a photo of. On the morning of Nov. 14, several concurrent events — including the Million MAGA March, the March for Trump and Stop the Steal DC — converged near Freedom Plaza in Washington. Among the demonstrators were conspiracy theorists, right-wing activists alleging widespread election fraud and members of the Proud Boys, a far right, all-male group with a history of violent confrontations. Several Washington news outlets estimated that the pro-Trump demonstrations had thousands of attendees. Trump himself has tweeted various estimates of the crowd size, ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. Women for America First, one of the groups that demonstrated, secured a National Park Service permit for 10,000 people in Freedom Plaza. Here are a few other estimates of the crowd size on Nov. 14: Fox News: ""Tens of thousands"" The Washington Post: ""Thousands"" WUSA: ""Thousands"" WTOP: ""Thousands"" CNN: ""Thousands"" USA Today: ""Tens of thousands"" The Washington Times: ""Thousands"" Washingtonian: ""Thousands"" We asked the Metropolitan Police Department for its best estimate of the attendance at the weekend’s Washington-area demonstrations, which grew violent toward the end of the day when hundreds of counterprotesters showed up. Brianna Jordan, a public affairs specialist, said the MPD ""does not provide numbers on crowd size."" It’s difficult to gauge crowd size, and estimates are just that — estimates. But there is no evidence that more than 1 million people attended pro-Trump demonstrations in Washington over the weekend. In her tweet, McEnany included two screenshots of a Fox News broadcast about the gatherings. The footage shows demonstrators on a street near Freedom Plaza, which is a few blocks east of the White House, a little after 11 a.m. Eastern Time. McEnany tweeted her estimate at 11:16 a.m. ET, before the marches were officially set to begin at noon. It’s also not possible for more than 135,000 people to fit into Freedom Plaza and the surrounding streets and sidewalks, according to MapChecking, an online tool that uses a mathematical equation to estimate how many people can fit in a given location. The stills that McEnany shared show plenty of space between demonstrators. For there to be 105,000 people depicted in the photos, which MapChecking classifies as ""packed"" for the location, there would have to have been four people per square meter. The National Park Service says the maximum capacity for Freedom Plaza is 13,900. For comparison, estimates of the crowd size at Trump’s inauguration ranged from 250,000 to 600,000. And that event was held on the National Mall, where there is far more space for people to spread out. Also in 2017, at least 470,000 people were estimated to have showed up for the Women’s March near the National Mall in Washington. Estimates for the crowd size at the 1995 Million Man March, which inspired the name of the Million MAGA March, vary widely, ranging between 400,000 and 1.9 million.

The screenshot depicts a post written under the account @SenatorKellyLoeffler. But that’s a fake account, said Loeffler spokesperson Stephen Lawson. On Parler, the account is listed as private and was formed eight days ago, shortly after the Nov. 3 election. We couldn’t determine whether such a message was actually posted under this account. Parler’s community guidelines ban ""any use of another’s name or likeness in a confusing or deceptive manner."" We asked Parler whether it plans to remove the fake Loeffler account and did not get an immediate response. Loeffler’s actual Parler account, @KLoeffler, showed no posts in which she commented about registering Black voters or any work by Abrams. Abrams created the New Georgia Project about six years ago to register people to vote.

No proof Warnock ‘ran over’ wife; obstruction case dropped
","With the future of Senate control in the hands of Georgia voters, Republicans and Democrats are hurling claim after claim at one another in advance of a Jan. 5 runoff for two Senate seats. The Rev. Raphael Warnock, the Democratic challenger to Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, was hit with a double-barreled attack Nov. 13 from Erick Erickson, a conservative Atlanta-based radio host. Tweeting a video excerpt from his show, Erickson claimed Warnock ""ran over his wife"" and was ""arrested for obstructing an investigation into child abuse."" The claim is highly misleading on both counts and comes as Republicans seek to maintain the political upper hand in the Senate, which is now split 50-48. No candidate in either of the Peach State contests on Nov. 3 earned more than 50% of the vote, leaving its two Senate seats up for grabs. So while Democrats are poised to control the White House and the House, control of the Senate won’t be known until after the Georgia runoffs. Warnock, pastor of the Atlanta church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached, finished first on Nov. 3 among 21 candidates seeking the seat held by Loeffler, who finished second. The Atlanta businesswoman was appointed on an interim basis in December to replace GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned with health problems.  The incident involving Warnock’s then-estranged wife occurred in Atlanta in March and made news a week later. Warnock was married to Oulèye Ndoye; they divorced in May. Until July, Ndoye served on Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms' executive team as the city’s senior human trafficking fellow.  Warnock called police to Ndoye’s Atlanta home shortly before 8:30 a.m. on March 2. According to a police report:   Warnock said Ndoye accused him of running over her left foot with his 2014 Tesla while they were arguing in her driveway. Ndoye was reluctant to show her foot to the officer, who wrote: ""I did not see any signs that Ms. Ouleye’s foot was ran over."" Medical personnel arrived and were ""not able to locate any swelling, redness, or bruising or broken bones on Ms. Ouleye’s left foot."" The child abuse case referenced in the ad stemmed from a 2002 police investigation into alleged child abuse at a church-run camp near Baltimore; Warnock was the church’s pastor.  According to news reports at the time, Warnock and the youth minister at Douglas Memorial Community Church in Baltimore were arrested July 31, 2002, and charged with trying to prevent a state trooper from interviewing teen counselors at the church's Camp Farthest Out in Eldersburg, about 30 miles northwest of Baltimore. Neither man was suspected of committing the alleged abuse, a state trooper said at the time. Warnock said he was charged when he asserted that lawyers should be present during the teens’ interviews. On Oct. 30, 2002, a judge dismissed the charges. The dismissal came at the request of a prosecutor, who said: ""What we decided was there was some miscommunication that had occurred with them. They were very helpful with the continued investigation. It would not have been a prudent use of resources to have prosecuted them."" Erickson did not reply to our requests for information to back up his statement. In addition to Erickson, Loeffler and other conservatives raised the incident after the Nov. 3 election. Erickson said Warnock ""ran over his wife"" and was ""arrested for obstructing an investigation into child abuse."" Police found no evidence that Warnock ran over his wife’s foot with his car during an argument in March 2020. In 2002, Warnock and another minister were arrested for interfering with law enforcement officers who were trying to interview youth camp counselors about child abuse allegations at the camp, which was run by a church where Warnock was the pastor. Warnock said he was asserting that lawyers should be present. The charges were later dropped at the request of a prosecutor, who said there had been miscommunication and that both ministers had been ""very helpful"" later in the investigation. Erickson’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

No proof Georgia Senate hopeful Warnock ‘welcomed’ Fidel Castro to his church
","When Fidel Castro, the late communist leader of Cuba, spoke at Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York City in 1995, he was welcomed by cheers from a crowd of 1,300 and a hug from Harlem’s Democratic congressman, Charles Rangel.  ""We have one of the great leaders of the world with us today,"" said the church’s pastor, the Rev. Calvin Butts, who was then interrupted by more cheers.  The Rev. Raphael Warnock, then the youth pastor at Abyssinian, was not on the dais.  But 25 years later, his connection to the church has been injected into a Jan. 5 election that will help determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.  Warnock, now pastor of the Atlanta church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, is the Democratic challenger to Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga. With a guilt-by-association attack, Loeffler made this claim in a Nov. 10 tweet: ""@ReverendWarnock celebrated Fidel Castro & welcomed him to his church. It’s another example of what we’ve been saying all along: He’s the most dangerous and radical candidate in America."" Warnock’s campaign has been vague about whether he attended the event, which was front-page news in the New York Times on Oct. 23, 1995.  But there is no evidence Warnock was involved in arranging Castro’s appearance or welcoming him. And a Fox News article about Warnock and the event, which Loeffler included with her tweet, says only that Warnock worked at Abyssinian at the time. After President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20, Democrats will control the White House and the House. Control of the Senate, where Republicans currently have a 50-48 edge, won’t be known until after two Georgia runoff elections Jan. 5. Runoffs are being held because no candidate in either race on Nov. 3 captured more than 50% of the vote. Loeffler was appointed on an interim basis in December to replace GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned with health problems. She finished second to Warnock on Nov. 3. In the other runoff, first-term GOP Sen. David Perdue faces Democrat Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker; Perdue edged Ossoff on Nov. 3.  If Democrats win both seats, they would effectively control the Senate, because as the next vice president, Kamala Harris could vote to break any ties. Castro appeared before 1,300 ""admirers"" at Abyssinian on the evening of Oct. 22, 1995, after speaking earlier in the day at the United Nations, the New York Times reported at the time. He ""held forth as if he were on a balcony overlooking a plaza in Havana, drinking in the cheers and applause that greeted his nearly every remark.""  Loeffler has repeated her attack on Warnock in a TV ad, on a website her campaign created to attack Warnock and at a campaign rally with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio also linked Warnock to the Castro event in a tweet, but didn’t go as far as Loeffler did in her claim. Her campaign referred PolitiFact to a press release that recounted the New York event and repeated the attack, but did not offer evidence for her claim that Warnock ""celebrated"" or ""welcomed"" Castro. Warnock campaign spokesman Terrence Clark told PolitiFact that Warnock ""doesn’t agree with the dictator’s beliefs and actions. He also wasn’t making decisions about who spoke at the church when he was a youth pastor."" Clark would not say whether Warnock attended the event. He also said Warnock would not be available for a five-minute phone interview that PolitiFact requested. We did not get replies to a call and email we left for Butts, who is still pastor at Abyssinian.  Loeffler said Warnock ""celebrated Fidel Castro and welcomed him to his church."" Warnock, now the pastor of a church in Atlanta, was the youth pastor at a New York City church when Castro spoke there in 1995.

Giuliani’s false claim of more than 600,000 unlawful votes in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia
","In Pennsylvania, Democrat Joe Biden got about 54,000 more votes than President Donald Trump. Some Trump supporters reject that tally, claiming without evidence that tens or even hundreds of thousands of ballots were counted illegitimately. ""It’s more like 600,000 plus unlawful votes in Philly and Pitt,"" Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani tweeted Nov. 11. Tom, it’s more like 600,000 plus unlawful votes In Philly and Pitt. https://t.co/5pdNiDXqKt We reached out to Giuliani’s communications director to ask where he got his number  and did not hear back. The Pennsylvania Department of State, which oversees elections, says the former New York mayor’s claim is unfounded. We found no rationale or explanation for how so many votes could have been fraudulently cast. ""There is no factual basis for this claim,"" said agency communications director Wanda Murren. ""Allegations of fraud and illegal activity have been repeatedly debunked and dismissed by the courts."" A U.S. District Court judge rebuffed a GOP suit that claimed Republican observers had been unfairly barred from certain areas of the Philadelphia Convention Center where mailed ballots were counted. Pressed by the judge, Republicans acknowledged that they did have representatives on the scene. Democrats and Republicans then established more detailed ground rules for how many party representatives would observe the count. A combined total of 1,409,483 votes were cast in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, the state’s two largest cities. Guiliani’s statement suggests that over 40% of them were illegal. His 600,000 figure is roughly equal to the entire number of mail-in ballots that were cast for Biden in the two cities. The state Republican Party is challenging a state Supreme Court ruling that allowed for counting mailed ballots that arrive within three days after polls closed on Election Day. State election officials said about 10,000 mail ballots were received during those three days. The state has kept those ballots separate, pending a resolution of the GOP challenge. The state did not include them in tallies that led the state to be called for Biden. Some have suggested that many ballots were counted without legally required oversight. We recently rated False a claim along those lines from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and debunked a claim from Trump that Republican observers were barred. We found no evidence that ballots were inappropriately cast or that observers were barred from watching. The Pennsylvania law that established mail-in voting and allows observers to be present when mail ballots are opened and recorded was passed by a Republican Legislature. ""Any laws around poll watchers apply equally to both major parties and any third parties,"" said Suzanne Almeida, interim executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania. ""I have seen no evidence that one party’s poll watchers have been treated any differently than the other."" Giuliani said over 600,000 votes were unlawful in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. There is no evidence to back that up. Pennsylvania law allows representatives from both parties to observe the count, and Republicans in the state told a judge that they did have monitors in the room. Pennsylvania’s Department of State denied that any votes were improperly counted.

No evidence Dominion Voting Systems caused widespread tabulation errors that flipped votes for Biden
","Dominion Voting Systems, which makes software and hardware for election officials to use around the country, is at the center of baseless claims that say ""glitches"" from its machines caused mistakes in vote tallies to favor Joe Biden in several states. Posts going around social media are spreading the claim alongside maps of the United States that appeared on the conservative news network NewsMax.  Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican who lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist in Florida’s 13th congressional district race, shared the graphics on her social media accounts and said: ""Whistleblowers who worked for Dominion software have come forward. The 2020 election is compromised due to this software/ the coding or ‘glitch’ to FLIP votes to Biden. We MUST fix this for future elections!"" The first map highlights the states that used Dominion machines — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The second map shows that, consequently, these are the same states where President Donald Trump is filing lawsuits that allege election fraud. President Donald Trump tweeted a more wide-ranging claim related to the system, saying, in part, that it ""deleted"" 2.7 million votes for his re-election nationwide. We rated that Pants on Fire. “REPORT: DOMINION DELETED 2.7 MILLION TRUMP VOTES NATIONWIDE. DATA ANALYSIS FINDS 221,000 PENNSYLVANIA VOTES SWITCHED FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP TO BIDEN. 941,000 TRUMP VOTES DELETED. STATES USING DOMINION VOTING SYSTEMS SWITCHED 435,000 VOTES FROM TRUMP TO BIDEN.” @ChanelRion @OANN The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It all started in Antrim County, Mich., when a clerk’s error led to an incorrect early tally that made it appear as if Joe Biden was winning it by about 3,000 votes. The error was never an official result and was corrected within two days, putting Trump ahead in the county by about 2,500 votes. The Michigan secretary of state’s office said it came down to human error by the Antrim County clerk, not a failure in Dominion’s system. ""Because the clerk did not update software, even though the tabulators counted all the ballots correctly, those accurate results were not combined properly when the clerk reported unofficial results,"" the Nov. 6 statement said. The mistake was limited to that one county. It is one of 65 counties in Michigan that use the company’s equipment. In Georgia, early morning voting halted temporarily in Morgan and Spalding counties when individual Dominion machines malfunctioned.  The issue there had to do with a breakdown between the digital list of voters provided by one company, and the voting machines provided by Dominion. Technicians resolved the problem, and a judge allowed the affected polls to stay open until 11 p.m. to make up for lost time. Georgia uses the same system statewide, and the glitch took place only in these two counties. There is no report that votes were miscounted. Trump easily carried both places, winning by a 40-point margin in Morgan County and by 20 points in Spalding. ""No credible reports or evidence of any software issues exist,"" Dominion says on its website. ""While no election is without isolated issues, Dominion Voting Systems are reliably and accurately counting ballots. State and local election authorities have publicly confirmed the integrity of the process."" RELATED: Trump supporters falsely tie Nancy Pelosi to broader election misfire scheme There is no credible evidence that any voting system was used to switch or delete votes, as online posts, President Trump and some right-wing media organizations are claiming.  The ""whistleblower"" referenced in Luna's Facebook post seems to have originated from Rudy Giuliani, the president's lawyer, who claimed that he was in contact with whistleblowers from Dominion, though he did not provide any evidence. The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, which is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security, released a joint statement with national, state and private election officials that said there is ""no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.""  The report Trump cited in his tweet aired Nov. 12 on One America News Network, a pro-Trump television network. The network cited an ""unaudited analysis of data obtained by Edison Research."" We reached out to OANN for a copy of that analysis but haven’t heard back.  Edison Research is a company that contracts with the National Election Pool, a consortium of American news organizations, to provide exit polling data during election cycles. Edison Research also partners with several TV networks to provide vote tabulation data. The company said it has not found data that back up OANN’s report or Trump’s tweet. ""Edison Research has produced no such report and we have no evidence of any voter fraud,"" said Larry Rosin, president of Edison Research. RELATED: Dominion Voting Systems ""deleted 2.7 million Trump votes nationwide.""  Election technology experts called the claims baseless, and said the numbers (like Trump’s 2.7 million ""deleted"" votes) are almost impossible to prove without a digital forensic investigation and a nationwide audit.  Edward Perez, election-technology expert at the OSET Institute, a nonprofit that studies voting infrastructure, said these claims show a misunderstanding of how election administration works. The process involves numerous protocols that include rigorous system tests that take place publicly, and before the technology is used in elections, Perez said. ""In the U.S., the way that elections are actually run, technology does not exist in a vacuum. It’s only one of multiple critical things that would make it exceedingly difficult for mass fraud to happen at this level undetected,"" he said. Nearly all election jurisdictions engage in testing of their systems and ballots before every election. In order for an election jurisdiction to flip votes fraudulently, bad actors would need to figure out how to simulate the appearance of that public testing. ""Statutes sometimes require this kind of ‘logic and accuracy testing,’ and even when they do not, it is a common process conducted by local election officials,"" the National Conference of State Legislatures says on its website. ""Logic and accuracy testing is generally conducted in public and serves dual purposes. First, it demonstrates that the voting system is able to accurately and completely tabulate the ballot and report results. Second, the public nature of it increases voter confidence."" And in many places, the test doesn’t only occur on the front end. A similar process is done, again, before officials start tabulating ballots. Without any credible evidence that the voting system is resulting in mass tabulation errors, Perez said, the posts and stories appear to border on outright disinformation. ""The claims have reached a scale that is so wild and outlandish that it is perfectly reasonable for people to wonder if the intent of such messages is to specifically inflame passions and to confuse people and undermine public confidence in the legitimacy of the election."" Viral social media posts claim that the 2020 presidential election is compromised because Dominion Voting Systems flipped votes to favor Joe Biden. This is wrong. There is no credible evidence that the system affected any vote counts. Minor problems, including human error and temporary machine malfunctions, took place in a few jurisdictions and did not impact vote tabulations.

Wisconsin Democrats jump the gun with claim that absentee ballot rejections are down
","As Democrats celebrate the unofficial victory of President-elect Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 presidential election, claims of subterfuge, trickery and outright fraud involving absentee ballots continue to rain down.  Thus far, there has been no evidence of widespread fraud presented, but Wisconsin lawmakers plan to issue their first subpoenas in years as part of an investigation into the election here.   Ben Wikler, Chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, rejected the fraud allegations in a Nov. 8 appearance on WISN-TV’s UpFront program. But he added another detail that caught our eye. ""Across the state the rejection rate for ballots went way down because so much work and so much care was taken both by voters themselves and clerks around the state,"" Wikler said. Is his claim that the rejection rate for ballots is down correct? Let’s take a look. When asked to back up the claim, Courtney Beyer, spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Democratic Party of Wisconsin, cited a Oct. 28, 2020, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article that reported 23,196 absentee ballots were rejected in the April 2020 election, about 1.8% of total ballots. Democrats believe there are signs it would be much lower for the November election. ""At least 23,000 ballots were rejected in April,"" Beyer said in an email.  ""We don’t know exactly how many absentee ballots were rejected from this election (and won’t for a while), but preliminary counts had it around 1,000. Significantly less."" Beyer also cited a Nov. 3  tweet from WisPolitics.com journalist Pat Poblete, who said ""Administrator Meagan Wolfe says as of this afternoon, 970 absentee ballots have been returned with a deficiency that would lead to them being rejected."" But Wikler’s claim was made while discussing the Nov. 3 election. Viewers would have had no reason to believe he was referencing data from the April primary. So let’s review what we know about absentee rejection Nov. 3. Elections Commission public information officer Reid Magney said the jury is still out on the absentee rejection count. ""We believe the numbers will be low, but we won’t know the rejection rate for several weeks,"" he said. ""Clerks have 45 days (after the election) to enter that data into the statewide voter database."" Magney said the 970 absentee ballots referenced as flagged ""was a preliminary, pre-election figure - ballots marked for rejection if the voters didn't fix problems."" In other words, it doesn’t give any general insight on how often ballots were rejected overall. However, there is an indication that the number of rejected absentee ballots could drop. The Oct. 28 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article points out that in April 2016, 5,860 absentee ballots were rejected — 2.5% of the total absentee ballots. And in April 2020, 23,196  absentee ballots were rejected. It’s a much higher raw number, but because so many more people used absentee ballots it was actually a smaller portion of total ballots — 1.8%. Wikler said, ""Across the state the rejection rate for ballots went way down.""  According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, it’s too early to know how many ballots were rejected.  It may very well be true that the absentee ballot rejection rate was lower than past elections, but for now, the commission says there is no data to confirm that. By looking at the 2016 rejected ballot rate compared with the improved April 2020 rate, there is a possibility the rejection will also be down for November 2020, but there is no data yet to confirm that. Even Democrats subsequently acknowledged, ""We don’t know exactly how many absentee ballots were rejected from this election (and won’t for a while)."" For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.   ",/factchecks/2020/nov/13/ben-wikler/democrats-jump-gun-claim-absentee-ballot-rejection/
