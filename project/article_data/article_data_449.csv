No, the Obamas have nothing to do with the ‘Varsity Blues’ college admissions scandal
","Is the Obama family embroiled in the high-profile college admissions bribery scandal, ""Operation Varsity Blues""? That’s what one popular Facebook post claims. The post was shared by the page ""American Web Media"" and displays an image of former president Barack Obama along with the words ""Obama’s Connection to Scandal Revealed."" The post’s caption says, ""The Obama family has now been connected to the country’s biggest scandal"" with a link to American Web Media’s article. The post, which has gotten over 2,000 comments and more than 1,200 shares since Oct. 9, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No, the Obamas have not been named in, or speculated to be connected with, any criminal activity related to the scandal.  The false headline of the American Web Media article, ""Obamas Connected To College Admissions Scandal,"" is clickbait. The body of the article says there is ""no link"" between the former first family and the scandal.  Federal prosecutors first released information about the scheme during a press conference in March 2019, when they announced charges against numerous wealthy parents accused of using bribery to influence undergraduate admissions for their children at top American universities. The investigation has implicated over 30 people, including actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin. So, what is this headline-grabbing connection that the Obamas have to the scandal? This: Michelle Obama and daughter Malia took tennis lessons with a coach who was later accused of taking bribes when he served as the tennis coach at Georgetown University.  The former Georgetown coach, Gordon Ernst, has been accused of accepting millions in bribes to help put at least 12 students on the university’s tennis team — including some who had minimal skill and never played the sport competitively But there is no indication, in the indictment or elsewhere, that the family had any knowledge of or involvement in Ernst’s activities.  Even the American Web Media article (which spells Ernst’s last name wrong) points this out: ""Although Michelle and Barack hired Gordon to teach their daughters the sport of tennis, there is no link between the Obamas and this college admission scandal. But it does go to show you how these schemers were dealing with some of the nation’s most prestigious people – and were trusted industry insiders. No one would have suspected that Gordon Ernest was really trying to conspire to commit racketeering."" This is a baseless rumor. The article’s false headline was used solely to generate website traffic which it obviously did, becoming fodder for viral social media posts like the one that caught our attention. We rate it False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC851080>],/factchecks/2019/oct/11/facebook-posts/no-obamas-have-nothing-do-varsity-blues-college-ad/

Donald Trump ad misleads about Joe Biden, Ukraine and the prosecutor
","A campaign ad from President Donald Trump claims it has ""facts"" about the Bidens and Ukraine, but instead mashes ideas together to create a highly misleading 30-second tale. ""Fact: Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor,"" the narrator says, and then cuts to a clip of a Biden statement: ""if the prosecutor is not fired you’re not getting the money. Well son of a bitch, he got fired."" The ad then continues: ""Fact: the prosecutor said he was forced out for leading a corruption probe into Hunter Biden's company. Fact: Democrats want to impeach President Trump for discussing this investigation with Ukraine's President. Fact: Donald Trump won but Democrats want to overturn the election."" The ad distorts the known facts about Ukraine prosecutor general Viktor Shokin and Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, where Biden’s son Hunter Biden served on the board. The Trump campaign announced the TV ad on Oct. 9. It has also been visible on social media. Key takeaways: • Biden did want Shokin fired, but western leaders had widely criticized the prosecutor general as corrupt and ineffective. Biden was leading a widespread consensus in asking for removal. • A former Ukrainian official said the investigation into Burisma was dormant under Shokin. • Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry for Trump’s statements suggesting he wanted Ukraine to investigate a political rival in exchange for political favors. ""Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor."" Biden did call for Ukraine to fire Shokin, but the ad fails to note that there were widespread calls for his ouster. Biden assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine after a popular revolution in early 2014 that led to pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country. Shokin became top prosecutor in 2015, after Yanukovych went into exile. A frustrated Biden in Dec. 2015 threatened to withhold $1 billion unless Shokin was fired, in hopes that a new prosecutor would do more to enforce the law. According to Biden, it worked.  The Trump campaign ad includes a clip of Biden’s partial reports at a Jan. 23, 2018, event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations. Biden spoke about getting a commitment from then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and from then-Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. ""I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours,"" Biden recounted. ""If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" ""Fact: the prosecutor said he was forced out for leading a corruption probe into Hunter Biden's company.""  There is evidence that many Western leaders and institutions, as well as Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, viewed Shokin as corrupt and ineffective for failing to prosecute anybody of significance, and for protecting members of Yanukovych’s and Poroshenko’s circles.  When Shokin was fired in the spring of 2016, press reports explicitly linked his ouster to corruption.  Steven Pifer, a career foreign service officer who held positions in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, previously told PolitiFact that ""virtually everyone"" he knew in the U.S. government and virtually all non-governmental experts on Ukraine ""felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired.""  ""All decent people were in favor of Shokin's sacking,"" Anders Åslund, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council told PolitiFact. ""Biden led a Western/anticorruption consensus."" Shokin did inherit some of the investigations into Burisma and owner Zlochevsky. Recently, Shokin said in a statement that his refusal to formally close the investigations led to his ouster.  But Vitaliy Kasko, who served as Shokin’s deputy overseeing international cooperation until he resigned in protest, told Bloomberg in 2019 that, under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma remained dormant. Kasko said the matter was ""shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015,"" and Bloomberg reported that documents backed up his account. The Trump campaign pointed to reporting by the New York Times that Yuriy Lutsenko, a subsequent prosecutor general, had cleared Burisma initially but then reopened the investigation in March. At the very least, Shokin's credibility in discussing the case has been undercut by other evidence and the widespread descriptions of his office as uninterested in prosecuting corruption cases. Democrats’ impeachment inquiry The ad says that ""Democrats want to impeach President Trump for discussing this investigation with Ukraine's President.""  The ad soft-pedals Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 by describing it merely as a discussion. The ad omits that a summary of the call shows Trump encouraging Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, and Attorney General William Barr and ""look into"" Biden. Before the call, Trump froze $400 million in aid to Ukraine. The hold on the money was lifted Sept. 11.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would move forward with an impeachment inquiry in September. Democrats are investigating whether Trump abused his presidential power by withholding the aid while asking its government to look into Biden, his potential 2020 opponent. They have not yet formulated articles of impeachment.  Our ruling A Trump ad says ""Fact: Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor .... Fact: the prosecutor said he was forced out for leading a corruption probe into Hunter Biden's company. Fact: Democrats want to impeach President Trump for discussing this investigation with Ukraine's President."" Biden called for Ukraine to fire Shokin, the prosecutor general, but so did many others. The facts show that Biden wanted Shokin removed due to widespread concerns that Shokin was ineffective in pursuing corruption cases — not that he was too aggressively pursuing cases. The Trump campaign cites Shokin himself, but he is not a reliable source. And Democrats want to impeach Trump for using foreign policy to promote his own re-election, not his desire to investigate corruption.  This ad claims a compilation of ""facts,"" but it’s presentation and lack of context is so misleading as to be inaccurate. We rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC731680>],/factchecks/2019/oct/11/donald-trump/trump-ad-misleads-about-biden-ukraine-and-prosecut/

Wisconsin lawmaker's claim that millionaires are eligible for food stamps is in the bag
","In July 2019, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a news release about proposed new rules for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps. The release said the proposed rule ""would fix a loophole that has expanded SNAP recipients in some states to include people who receive assistance when they clearly don’t need it."" What does that mean, exactly? Here’s how U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Glenbeulah, framed it when backing the plan in an Oct. 2, 2019 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:  ""A lot of people didn’t know that millionaires are eligible for food stamps,"" he said. ""I’m glad Donald Trump came along and decided to put a stop to it."" The article noted nearly 40,000 Wisconsinites would lose food benefits under the proposed changes. The state would also have to upgrade its computer systems, retrain workers and make other changes that would cost millions of dollars a year. But let’s return to Grothman and his claim. Is he right that millionaires are eligible for food stamps?  Let’s take a look. How the program works According to the Journal Sentinel article: Nearly 40 million people, including about 644,000 Wisconsinites, received food stamps in 2018. Like most states, Wisconsin provides food benefits to people who qualify for other government programs without performing additional income and asset tests. The proposed rule would bar people in other programs from automatically qualifying for food stamps. Reviews of their income and assets would need to be conducted to ensure that, in most cases, their income is at or below 130% of the federal poverty level and they do not have liquid assets worth more than $2,250. For a family of three, 130% of the federal poverty level is about $2,250 a month. Nationwide, the proposal is expected to save $2.5 billion and cut benefits to about 3 million people. As the Journal Sentinel article noted: In Wisconsin, about 39,600 people in about 24,100 households would lose more than $11 million in benefits a year, according to estimates from the state Department of Health Services. Of those, about 13,000 are children and about 11,000 are senior citizens.  So, where do the millionaires come in? The back door, apparently. The evidence When asked to provide backup, Grothman’s staff pointed us to several news articles, including a Sept. 16, 2019 report from the Washington Examiner that reminded readers about the case of Leroy Fick who continued to receive food stamps after winning $2 million in the Michigan State Lottery in 2010.  ""Fick used his winnings to buy a new home and an Audi convertible, all while continuing to receive SNAP benefits,"" the Examiner article said. That story has been making the rounds for a while. In 2011, ABC News reported on the Fick case with a headline that asked: ""How can a man who won millions in the lottery still use food stamps?""  At the time, Michigan used federal guidelines that based eligibility for food stamps solely on income. The state considered Fick’s $850,000 lump sum lottery payment an asset -- not income. So, under state policy then in effect, Fick could legally get food stamps.  The state subsequently banned anyone with assets of more than $5,000, excluding a car, from the food stamp program. That ban knocked Fick off the food stamp rolls. According to a Congressional Research Service report on the SNAP program, as of October 2018, 34 states -- Wisconsin among them -- that do not check the assets of people applying for food stamps. In announcing the proposed rule changes, there was no mention of lottery winners, but USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue referred to the case of a well-off Minnesota man, retired engineer Rob Undersander, who signed up for food stamps to prove a point.  In a Sept. 28, 2016 opinion piece for The St. Cloud (Minn.) Times, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, Undersander said he and his wife have a net worth that ""exceeds $1 million."" In that and other accounts, he said he wanted to expose a loophole that would allow people who are wealthy, or at least those not needy, to qualify for food stamps. So he filled out an application for food stamps in June 2016. He said he was up front about his assets. Undersander said he gave the money he received to charity When his case was described at a June 20, 2019 House agriculture subcommittee, the story ignited a partisan firestorm. Democratic lawmakers accused Undersander of ""defrauding the government with a ridiculous millionaire stunt."" Republicans hailed Undersander for ""exposing the flaws of a failed system.""  The Wisconsin picture In a Sept. 23, 2019 letter to Perdue, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and 14 other Senate Democrats urged the Trump administration to withdraw the proposal. The letter cited the negative consequences of the rule and argued the administration has not conducted an accurate analysis of its impact on children and families. Other Democratic officials, including Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul are also opposed to the change. ""The bottom line is you’d have more cost on bureaucracy and administration and fewer benefits going to Wisconsinites,"" Kaul said in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.  To be sure, the reduced threshhold would not apply just to millionaires. It would also apply to people who make just a dollar a year more than the current guidelines -- folks who are far from wealthy.  Grothman is standing behind the proposal.  ""It’s obviously frustrating for people living paycheck to paycheck to know that the person ahead of them in line using FoodShare may have $200,000 in the bank,"" Grothman told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Our ruling Grothman claimed millionaires are eligible for food stamps, but ""Donald Trump came along and decided to put a stop to it.""  The millionaires may be outliers, but Grothman’s claim was that they are eligible -- not that they were receiving benefits in high numbers.  The proposed rule from Trump’s USDA would bar people in other programs from automatically qualifying for food stamps. It would also require a review of an applicant’s assets -- not just their income. It’s that provision that has, in the past, allowed wealthy individuals to receive the benefits. Wisconsin is among dozens of states that do not do asset checks now. We rate Grothman’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE650C0>],/factchecks/2019/oct/11/glenn-grothman/wisconsin-lawmakers-claim-millionaires-are-eligibl/

Are Chicago Public School teachers among the nation’s highest paid?
","While defending Chicago’s offer to the union representing the city’s public school teachers, Mayor Lori Lightfoot claimed it would provide them with a generous salary increase — on top of an already high payscale. At a town hall Lightfoot held last month, a high school student told the mayor students need teachers to be paid well, emphasizing the role they play in students’ lives. ""I agree with you 100% that teachers are important,"" Lightfoot responded. ""Teachers do need to be paid well, and in Chicago, they are. Teachers in Chicago Public Schools are paid some of the highest compensation of any school system in the country."" The city’s offer to increase teacher pay by 16% over five years, Lightfoot added, is ""a good deal."" The city’s last contract with the Chicago Teachers Union expired in June, and the district’s 25,000 teachers and support staff have set an Oct. 17 strike date if a deal isn’t hammered out by then. Is Lightfoot correct that teachers in Chicago are already among the nation’s highest paid? We decided to find out. Under the most recent contract, the district’s base salary for a new teacher with a bachelor’s degree is just under $53,000. The maximum salary a teacher can earn in CPS after years of experience and with higher credentials is a little more than $101,000. That’s before the value of required annual pension contributions the district makes on a teacher’s behalf. In response to our inquiry, a spokesperson for Lightfoot’s office provided a spreadsheet comparing CPS teacher salaries at different levels in their careers with those in districts in the nation’s 10 other largest cities, and pointed us to some state-level salary data. But Lightfoot didn’t limit her comparison to what teachers make in other large cities, so we went looking for more comprehensive data to assess her sweeping claim. None of the sources we found allow for a direct comparison of overall teacher compensation — not just salary, but pension and health care benefits — across all districts nationally. However, figures compiled by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a nonpartisan policy and research center, make it possible to compare teacher salaries at various levels of education and experience among the nation’s 124 largest districts. During the 2017-2018 school year, the latest year for which the group has updated figures, Chicago ranked 22nd out of 124 for its starting salary. The survey adjusted for cost of living using a measure developed by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. Chicago’s ranking improved for teachers with more years of teaching and higher education credentials, according to the center’s analysis. For example, a teacher with a master’s degree and 10 years of job experience made more under Chicago’s salary schedule than their counterparts in all but two of the districts included in the group’s database. Even so, Lightfoot didn’t constrain her remarks to the nation’s 100-plus largest districts either. And salary schedules are different than the average compensation a teacher in a given district actually receives. ""A salary schedule really doesn’t tell you what the reality is on the ground,"" said Robert Bruno, a labor expert at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, adding that it doesn’t say how many teachers are actually making that pay. ""It says contractually, this is where people would be if they’re at this level."" So we turned to data obtained by the Better Government Association through an open records request to the Illinois State Board of Education to see how Chicago stacked up within state lines. (The Better Government Association runs PolitiFact Illinois.) The short answer: Not so well. Chicago Public Schools came out 109th of the state’s more than 800 school districts based on average teacher pay alone. Including bonuses, health and pension benefits, its ranking rose somewhat. But it still trailed 34 other districts, many of them located in the more affluent suburbs outside Chicago and in the surrounding collar counties. Ben Ost, an economist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told us it’s likely CPS trails districts in similar suburbs throughout the nation as well. Lightfoot said Chicago Public School teachers are ""paid some of the highest compensation of any school system in the country."" Data from teacher salary schedules compiled by the National Council on Teacher Quality shows Chicago ranks 22nd among the nation’s 124 largest districts for starting salary. Its ranking also nears the top of the list for teachers with more years of experience and higher degrees. But Lightfoot didn’t limit her remarks to larger districts, nor to salary. So we turned to Illinois data, which shows CPS ranks well outside the top 20 for average teacher compensation in its own state. We rate Lightfoot’s claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Fact-checking ethylene production in the U.S.
","Three U.S. House members from West Virginia have proposed creating an Appalachian Storage Hub to store and transport large amounts of natural gas liquids in the region. One of those House members is West Virginia Republican David McKinley. In a news release announcing House Resolution 4433 -- the Appalachian Regional Energy Hub Initiative -- McKinley said he backs the effort and cited Hurricane Harvey, the 2017 storm that shocked coastal Texas and Louisiana, as evidence that a more reliable storage system is needed. ""Developing such a ‘Hub’ in Appalachia would bring significant investment and jobs to the region,"" McKinley said in his op-ed for the Fairmont News. In his news release, McKinley wrote that the danger for the nation is that today, ""about 95% of America’s production of ethylene is produced on the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana — a region exposed to major storms like Hurricane Harvey."" Is he right about that percentage? We took a closer look. First, let’s explain what ethylene is. Ethylene is commonly used to produce polyethylene, which is one of the most commonly produced plastics in the world. Food packaging and containers, bottles, and housewares are among the products manufactured from polyethylene. McKinley’s District of Columbia office pointed us to a report to Congress by the U.S. Energy Department released in November 2018.   The report includes a line that says that ""ethylene production capacity is highly concentrated in the United States Gulf Coast; over 95% of U.S. ethylene production capacity is located in either Texas or Louisiana."" The figure below illustrates the total capacity in million metric tons that each region produces, the majority of which comes from Texas and Lousiania.   Documented Ethylene Production Capacity in the U.S. (Source: Ethane Storage and Distribution hub in the United States) After Hurricane Harvey hit the U.S. in Texas and Louisiana, 60% of the production capacity in America went offline, causing problems for industry, at least in the short term.   It’s worth noting that these numbers can be expected to shift once a major ""ethane cracker"" plant in Monaca, Pa., comes online in another year or two.  Crackers are facilities that break down ethane into multiple byproducts, including ethylene. The Shell Chemicals facility in Monaca is expected to produce 1.6 million metric tons per year of ethylene. The Energy Department report cites two additional ethylene facilities in the Appalachian region that are on the drawing board, though they are slated to come online after the Monaca plant. They are in Washington Bottom, W.Va., and Shadyside, Ohio. McKinley said, ""About 95% of America’s production of ethylene is produced on the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana — a region exposed to major storms like Hurricane Harvey."" The scale of operations in Appalachia are on track to grow in the coming years, but for now, McKinley is correct: Energy Department data shows that more than 95% of U.S. ethylene production capacity is located in either Texas or Louisiana.  We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBEA180>],/factchecks/2019/oct/10/david-mckinley/fact-checking-ethylene-production-us/

Pelosi, Romney and Kerry don’t have sons working for companies linked to Ukraine
","Hunter Biden isn’t the only politician's child who’s been scrutinized in the past few weeks for his work overseas. On Facebook, several widely shared posts claim the sons of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Mitt Romney, R-Utah, are also on the boards of energy companies linked to Ukraine. Other posts add former Secretary of State John Kerry to the mix. ""Biden’s son, Pelosi’s son, Romney’s son (are) all on the board of director (sic) for energy companies doing business in Ukraine,"" one post reads. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And they’ve collectively reached thousands of users, so we wanted to check them out. The source material of the posts appears to be a viral tweet published Oct. 6 by Jack Murphy, co-founder of conservative news site TrendingPolitics.com. ""Biden's son, Pelosi's son, Romney's son, Kerry’s son,"" he tweeted. ""All are on the board of directors for energy companies doing business in Ukraine… Coincidence? No."" (Screenshot from Facebook) We reached out to Murphy for the source of his post, but we haven’t heard back. Several conservative publications had reported on the allegations about Pelosi’s son, Paul, days before Murphy made that assertion. We looked into the business dealings of Pelosi, Romney and Kerry’s sons.  Paul Pelosi Jr. once served on the board of an American energy company, Viscoil, that dissolved and re-formed in Singapore under a different name. But Paul Pelosi had no part in the new entity, and it’s unclear to what extent the company has done business in Ukraine. Reports of the connection appeared in One America News Network and other conservative outlets, the source of which appears to be an Oct. 3 tweet from Patrick Howley, a writer for The Epoch Times. The pro-Donald Trump website has been known to publish conspiratorial content. ""BOOM: Nancy Pelosi's son Paul Pelosi Jr. (who went to Ukraine in 2017) was a board member of Viscoil and executive at its related company NRGLab, which DID ENERGY Business in UKRAINE!"" Howley said in the tweet, which has been retweeted more than 12,000 times. ""And Nancy Pelosi appeared in a promotional video for the company!"" As evidence, Howley linked to two YouTube videos published March 5, 2013. The first shows Paul Pelosi speaking at an event in Washington. The video opens with clips of a speech from Nancy Pelosi and then shows Paul at an XPRIZE Foundation competition in September 2010. The nonprofit group organizes public competitions with businesses to encourage their technological development.  RELATED STORY: PolitiFact's Trump-Ukraine-Biden coverage in one place ""My name’s Paul Pelosi, of course I’m on the board of Viscoil, and Viscoil’s here today to talk about accelerating the future,"" he says during the video. Viscoil was a California-based holding company that dissolved in 2010. An old version of the company's website said the company was created to ""engage in research and in the commercial development of hydrocarbon production methods and technologies."" After it shuttered, Viscoil was folded into NRGLab, a Singapore-based company ""specializing in different areas of scientific research."" It appears to have published the YouTube videos. The second video Howley posted shows Walter Afanasieff, a Brazilian-American musician, talking about how technology could improve oil extraction. The caption lists other artists that had promoted Viscoil’s work, including Mika Newton, a Ukrainian singer and actress. ""Mika Newton helped to secure the rights to build a plant for the production of SH-boxes in Ukraine,"" the caption reads. An SH-box is a kind of environmentally friendly generator, according to NRGLab. We found a Facebook page on which Newton has promoted NRGLab’s work, but we could find no news coverage about the company's dealings in Ukraine. NRGLab does not mention the country on its website. We reached out to the company for more information but did not get a response. To sum it up: Paul Pelosi served on the board of Viscoil. At one point, a Ukrainian singer is alleged to have promoted the company. But Pelosi was off the board before that happened. That’s the connection people have identified. Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, told PolitiFact that Paul Pelosi worked for Viscoil for a short time. He denied that it had any dealings in Ukraine at the time. ""The company was based in Southern California and focused solely on U.S. business,"" he said in an email. ""The company later reorganized under a different name, but Paul Pelosi Jr. played no role in the new entity."" Hunter Biden did serve as a board member for a Ukrainian energy company, from 2014 until the spring of 2019. As for the sons of Kerry and Romney, there is no evidence to suggest that they ever held similar positions. Burisma Holdings appointed Hunter Biden to its board of directors in 2014 to help the energy company improve its corporate governance and adopt Western-style transparency. His father, the former vice president and Democratic candidate running for president in 2020, has faced criticism for the appointment over a conflict of interest. Kerry has three stepsons from his marriage with Teresa Heinz, heiress to the H.J. Heinz ketchup fortune: John IV, André and Chris. John is an educator, while André is an environmentalist. RELATED STORY: Ask PolitiFact: Answers to reader questions about the Trump impeachment inquiry, Hunter Biden Chris is a businessman with extensive experience in private equity and venture capital — including pursuing a string of investment and consulting firms with Hunter Biden and Devon Archer, another businessman who was Chris Heinz’s roommate at Yale University. He co-founded Rosemont Seneca Partners, a Washington investment fund, in 2009 with Biden and Archer. Biden and Archer would later serve on the board of Burisma, but Chris Heinz never did. In fact, he advised Archer against joining the board and, when both he and Hunter didn’t heed the warning, Heinz ended his business relationships with them. ""Chris has never been on the board of any energy company; nor has he ever traveled to or worked in Ukraine,"" a spokesman for John Kerry told PolitiFact in an email. All the Heinz children are board members of the Heinz Endowments, the philanthropic arm of their family’s estate, but we could find no evidence that any have served on the board of an energy company linked to Ukraine. Romney has five sons who work in a variety of different fields: Tagg, Matt, Craig, Josh and Ben. We could find no evidence that any of them have served on the board of an energy company with ties to Ukraine. Tagg Romney runs a private equity firm called Solamere Capital. Matt Romney runs a firm called Excel Trust, which owns shopping centers across the United States. Craig Romney works in real estate. Josh Romney is the founder and president of The Romney Group, a real estate company based in Salt Lake City. Ben Romney is a radiologist in Utah. We reached out to a spokeswoman for Romney for more details about his sons’ business dealings, but she declined to comment on the substance of the Facebook posts. ""We don’t comment on fake news from random online trolls,"" Romney spokeswoman Liz Johnson said in an email. Several Facebook posts claimed that the sons of Biden, Pelosi, Romney and Kerry are on the boards of ""energy companies doing business in Ukraine."" Beyond Hunter Biden’s already well-known tenure as a board member for Ukrainian energy company Burisma (which ended in spring 2019), this claim is inaccurate and represents a false attack against those who have spoken out against Trump. Pelosi’s son, Paul, briefly served on the board of an American energy company before it dissolved in 2010, but there’s no evidence the company had dealings with Ukraine while he held that seat. Kerry stepson, Chris, has worked with Hunter and another former Burisma board member in the past, but he severed ties after they joined the energy company in 2014. There is no evidence that any of Romney’s sons have served on the board of any energy companies with ties to Ukraine. We rate these Facebook claims False.

Trump wrong about North Carolina Congressional election polling
","President Donald Trump recently cast himself as the hero in a story about a congressional race in North Carolina, according to a speech recently obtained by Bloomberg News. The congressional race was in North Carolina’s 9th district, where Republican Dan Bishop defeated Democrat Dan McCready in a special election on Sept. 10. Trump’s comments came during a private event in New York on Sept. 27. Trump told the crowd that Bishop was behind in the race until he visited North Carolina and tweeted about the race. ""But the candidate, Dan Bishop, won — by a lot. He was down by 17, and they had lines a mile long. I mean the lines going into those voting booths were unbelievable,"" Trump said, according to Bloomberg’s transcript of the speech. This is at least the second time Trump has claimed that Bishop was down 17 points. The first came on the night of the election. ""Dan Bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. He then asked me for help, we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race. Big Rally last night. Now it looks like he is going to win,"" he tweeted. PolitiFact looked at publicly available polling, as well as the race results, to see whether Trump was correct about its competitiveness. We couldn’t find any public poll that showed Bishop behind by 17 points, or even double-digits. And we found his description of the election results to be exaggerated. WHAT POLLS REPORTED The website FiveThirtyEight tracked some of the polling of the district. No public poll had McCready up by 17. The most favorable poll for him had him up five points, and the poll most favorable to Bishop had him up four points. A Co/Efficient poll published three days before the election had McCready up three points. Public Policy Polling, known as PPP, conducted a private poll of District 9 residents about two weeks prior to the election. That poll showed Bishop up, said Tom Jensen, the company’s director. Vox, an online news source, conducted a similar fact-check and couldn’t find a poll to support Trump’s claims, either. The piece of polling that comes close to supporting Trump’s claim was tweeted by Jim Blaine, a campaign consultant for Bishop. An internal campaign poll showed McCready up 14 percentage points on Bishop. But that poll is an outlier. And details — such as who conducted the survey, who responded to the survey, the date — aren’t available to the public. PolitiFact contacted Blaine and Samantha Cotten, a regional communications director for Trump’s campaign, but didn’t receive a response by the time this fact check was published online. THE RESULTS Most experts considered the race a toss-up, a surprise given the district’s history. ""While we’ve thought the Republicans were better positioned to win the NC-9 do-over special election — and that may end up being the case — the latest data, and the latest circumstances, suggest that the race is close enough that we should make it a Toss-up with less than a week to go until Tuesday’s election,"" Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, wrote on Sept. 5. Trump won the district by 12 points in 2016. No Democrat had won the congressional race since 1963, according to the Charlotte Observer. It didn’t happen this year either. Bishop beat McCready by 3,788 votes — 96,573 to 92,785. That breaks down to 50.69% of the vote for Bishop and 48.70% of the vote for McCready, a difference of 1.99 percentage points. Not exactly a blowout. OUR RULING Trump said Bishop was ""down by 17"" points in NC congressional race and then won ""by a lot."" No public polls came close to supporting Trump’s claim, and the final margin was only 2 percentage points. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB1DBC0>],/factchecks/2019/oct/10/donald-trump/trump-wrong-about-north-carolina-congressional-ele/

Missouri meth use is up, but Hawley is right: lab seizures have dropped dramatically
 ","In a recent Twitter conversation, Sen. Josh Hawley was accused of scapegoating Mexico for Missouri’s meth problem. ""Don’t blame Mexico for what is produced in our own state under your watch,"" the tweeter, identified as Conrad Hake, wrote. Hake was responding to Hawley’s demand that Democratic presidential hopefuls should declare whether there’s a security threat at the border. Hawley responded: ""Wrong. Meth production in MO has cratered over last decade. MO Hwy Patrol reported 1,326 meth lab seizures in 2006, only 50 in 2018. But meth addiction & overdoses are skyrocketing. DEA’s 2018 Threat Assessment Report says most of meth in U.S. made in Mexico & smuggled over border."" That would be a huge decrease, and the DEA report does say meth in the United States is made in Mexico and transported into the United States, so we decided to do some digging on the numbers of meth production. Missouri State Highway Patrol’s report holds up The numbers are correct, according to a Missouri State Highway Patrol report. Incidents in Missouri for methamphetamine chemical/equipment/glassware seizures, laboratories and dumpsites was 1,326 in 2006. The most incidents were in St. Charles, at 125 in the same year. In 2018, Missouri had 50 methamphetamine incidents, the report said. ""The key factor for the decrease in methamphetamine laboratories is the transportation of crystal methamphetamine into the state,"" said Sgt. Shawn Griggs, Missouri State Highway Patrol spokesman. Missouri production is down, but consumption of meth is still here. Hawley cited the 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment released by the DEA. It reports that most methamphetamine in the United States is being produced in Mexico. In 2006, federal and state laws restricted the sale of an over-the-counter cold medicine, pseudoephedrine, that was essential to home-cooked meth. Griggs said 75 communities in the state have created prescription-only ordinances for pseudoephedrine products. In 2017, Missouri joined an electronic system that tracks and limits the sale of over-the-counter cold and allergy medications containing pseudoephedrine, ephedrine or phenylpropanolamine. As pseudoephedrine became harder to get in Missouri, production shifted to Mexico, which now manufactures more meth than the United States. Chris Twitchel, a captain in the Camden County Sheriff’s Department and an adjunct professor of criminology and sociology at Columbia College, said nine years ago a big drug bust would be getting a few ounces. In the middle of September, the drug task force in Camden County got 2 pounds from a guy. ""I think it’s less risk to buy it from a source than try to make it on your own,"" Twitchel said. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Missouri’s drug-related deaths increased 18.1% from February 2018 to February 2019. Delaware is the only state with a higher increase at 18.6%. Meanwhile, nationally the amount of drug-related deaths decreased 3.9%. According to data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, from 2012 to 2016 people seeking treatment for meth addiction in Missouri increased 52%. Hawley tweeted, ""Meth production in MO has cratered over last decade. MO Hwy Patrol reported 1,326 meth lab seizures in 2006, only 50 in 2018."" The numbers are correct for methamphetamine equipment seizures, laboratories and dumpsites, according to state and federal reports.

Viral rumor about a Pelosi Ukrainian ‘legislative aide’ twists facts, exaggerates connection
","After House Democrats moved forward with an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump over a phone call with Ukraine’s president, a photo of a woman shaking hands with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi circulated as supposed evidence of Pelosi’s own connections with Ukraine elite. In reality, the rumor is an attempt to smear Pelosi using an American college student only because she was an intern of Pelosi's for a semester and is of Ukrainian descent.  The photo, shared here Oct. 1, has appeared all over social media with text around it that says: ""Nancy Pelosi’s legislative aide, Ivanna Voronovych, is from the Ukraine and is connected to the Ukrainian Embassy, the Ukrainian military, the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian party life … How did this Ukrainian get cleared to work in the office of the person third in line to the U.S. presidency?""  Another image laid over the photo in the upper left hand corner shows a man and a woman along with more text that says, ""Patriarch Filaret Head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church"" and ""Mom’s Ukraine Order of Merit for Military & Political Activity."" The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This claim is inaccurate.  PolitiFact found that Ivanna Voronovych did serve as an intern in Pelosi’s district-focused office in Washington, D.C., for a college semester, but did not (and does not currently) work for Pelosi as an aide, nor does she hold any other position in Pelosi’s office. (Also, the Speaker of the House is second in line to the presidency not the third, as the post states.) The rumor appears to have originated with a Sept. 30, 2019, story by right-leaning website the Gateway Pundit. That story says Voronovych ""started her career working at the US Embassy in the Ukraine in Kiev"" and that ""she worked for Roman Woronowycz, the Kiev Bureau Chief, who is connected to Nancy Pelosi."" It goes on to claim that, ""Voronovych’s parents are well connected. Her mom worked with the Ukrainian Army, and even received the Ukraine Order of Merit for military and political activity. Yoronovych’s [sic] father worked in the Ukrainian Foreign Service and he’s also connected to the Ukrainian government."" Something to note: Roman Woronowycz is Voronovych’s father and is not listed as the bureau chief for the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, though he does work at the U.S. Agency for International Development in Kiev, according to an agency spokesperson. PolitiFact reached out to Voronovych about the rumors. She responded by email, explaining that she is a U.S. citizen and has lived in Ukraine as well as other countries due to her father’s employment with USAID. She said that she interned for Pelosi in the spring of 2018 while a sophomore at Northeastern University in Boston and when Pelosi was the House minority leader. Voronovych said her father is a Michigan native and is not chief of the Kiev bureau of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, as the post states. Voronovych is now a senior at the University of Michigan, where, as a transfer student, she is studying political science and philosophy. ""Since finishing my internship I have not had any contact with the Speaker, as I imagine she is occupied with more important things than keeping tabs on her previous interns,"" Voronovych said. She said she has spent the last five years working as a summer hire at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine but never worked with the Ukraininan Embassy in the United States or elsewhere. ""I have no ties to the Ukrainian government or military outside of the work that I did while employed with the State Department.""  Ivanna Voronovych’s mother, Viktoria Voronovych, is a Ukrainian-born American citizen and co-founder of the nonprofit International Alliance for Fraternal Assistance, which has helped raise money to deliver medical supplies, gear, equipment and other items to Ukrainian soldiers who were fighting against Russia-backed rebels, according to an interview she gave in 2015 to the Macomb Daily, a newspaper in Detroit. The photo in the upper-left corner of the viral Facebook post shows Viktoria Voronovych receiving a medal from the patriarch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church for her conflict zone volunteer work, according to Ivanna Voronovych, who also sent PolitiFact an image of the medal, which indicates it was presented in 2015. Ivanna Voronovych said that the organization, which appears to be based in Kiev, raised money from other Ukrainians now living in the United States, most notably Michigan, Illinois and North Carolina. These days, Ivanna Voronovych said, her mother’s work involves supporting people with disabilities sustained either at birth or by way of involvement in the conflict. ""This story is a hoax and an outlandish compilation of twisted lies,"" Voronovych said. ""I have received disturbing messages from people that choose to believe this disinformation, making me feel unsafe and as a possible target. The comments under some of the Facebook posts alone are enough to make one worry. I am a private citizen and should not be subject to such an invasion of privacy, libel and defamation of my character."" On Oct. 3, Woronowycz also posted a response to the rumors surrounding his daughter on his Facebook page, saying she is an American citizen who interned with Pelosi while also working at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine during summers. He wrote that the rumors have even resulted in death threats: ""My daughter, Ivanna Voronovych, was hit hard two days ago by bots with stories that contain outright lies and twisted facts. She is an American citizen, an honors student and a social activist who also interned with Speaker Pelosi, while also working at the US Embassy in Ukraine during summers. She has no connections to the Ukrainian military or the Ukrainian Embassy. Dozens of pieces by fly-by-night sites are sharing these gross and dangerous lies. The results have been death threats and lurid comments made by obviously deranged, heartless, soul less, and morally empty a*******. No one deserves this."" Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, confirmed to PolitiFact that Voronovych was an intern in Pelosi’s personal office in Washington, which works solely on representational issues for Pelosi’s congressional district, the 12th District of California. ""This individual was an intern in our personal office (meaning CA-12 not leadership office). She was an unpaid intern in the spring of 2018 who answered phones and performed other administrative duties,"" Hammill wrote in an email. ""The Speaker takes a photo with every intern during their time in Washington."" On May 31, 2018, in that same time period, Voronovych posted the photo of herself shaking hands with with Pelosi on her own Facebook page. A Facebook post displays an image of a woman shaking hands with Nancy Pelosi and claims that the woman, Ivanna Voronovych, is ""Pelosi’s legislative aide"" from the Ukraine who is connected to ""the Ukrainian Embassy, the Ukrainian military, the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian party life."" Ivanna Voronovych has lived in Ukraine and once served as an unpaid intern for Pelosi for a semester in 2018. But she is also a U.S. citizen and is not employed by Pelosi. Her mother, an American citizen, has also been an activist in Ukraine and previously helped deliver food and supplies to army members. This rumor wrongly suggests Voronovych, an American, is a significant influence on Pelosi, based only on Voronovych’s Ukrainian heritage and because she once held an internship in Pelosi’s office. We rate it False. Update, Oct. 10, 2019: This story has been updated to reflect that a spokesperson with the U.S. Agency for International Development confirmed that Roman Woronowycz is employed there. This addition does not affect the ruling.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD85D00>],/factchecks/2019/oct/09/facebook-posts/viral-rumor-about-pelosi-ukrainian-legislative-aid/

Donald Trump is wrong. Whistleblower account of Ukraine phone call was 'almost completely' right
","When President Donald Trump heard that a second whistleblower was in the wings, he quickly dismissed the news. ""The first so-called second hand information ‘Whistleblower’ got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another ‘Whistleblower’ is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info,"" Trump tweeted Oct. 5. ""Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming!"" The first so-called second hand information “Whistleblower” got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another “Whistleblower” is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info. Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming! We compared the whistleblower complaint with the White House memorandum of the July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.  What we found is Trump’s wrong: The whistleblower got just about everything right. Here are the excerpts from the whistleblower’s filing (in bold), followed by whether the information is confirmed. Early in the morning of 25 July, the President spoke by telephone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. — Confirmed by the memorandum of the call. After an initial exchange of pleasantries, the President used the remainder of the call to advance his personal interests. — Setting aside the characterization of the purpose as ""personal interests,"" the allocation of the number of words between pleasantries and a request for help with investigations accurately reflects the memorandum. The complaint then describes what Trump wanted Ukraine to do. Initiate or continue an investigation into the activities of former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. — Confirmed, according to the memorandum that quotes Trump as saying the following: ""The other thing. There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me."" Assist in purportedly uncovering that allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine, with a specific request that The Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cyber security firm Crowdstrike. — Confirmed, according to the memorandum. Trump is quoted as saying: ""I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.  ""As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible."" Meet or speak with two people the President named explicitly as his personal envoys on these matters, Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General Barr, to whom the President referred multiple times in tandem. — Confirmed, according to the memorandum: Zelensky is the first to bring up Giuliani’s name. As for what Trump said, he did mention both men several times and in tandem. Trump: ""Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great."" Trump: ""I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people."" Trump: ""I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.""  The President also praised Ukraine’s Prosecutor General, Mr. Yuriy Lutsenko, and suggested that Mr. Zelenskyy might want to keep him in his position. — This is ambiguous. Trump made no reference to Lutsenko by name. What he said was, ""I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved.""  Trump might have been thinking of the previous prosecutor general Viktor Shokin; that would fit more with a prosecutor who had been ""shut down."" The current prosecutor at the time, however, was Lutsenko. From the memorandum, which indicates that certain sections were left out and doesn’t name the prosecutor, we can’t tell for sure. I was told by White House officials that no other (corruption) ""cases"" were discussed. — The memorandum shows that only the DNC server and the Bidens came up. I was told that a State Department official, Mr. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, also listened in on the call. — Unconfirmed. One news report based on an unnamed source said Brechbuhl wasn’t on the call. We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Trump said that the whistleblower ""got my phone conversation almost completely wrong."" In reality, the complaint got nearly every detail correct, as the memorandum released by the White House shows. It was correct on the request that Ukraine investigate the Bidens and the notion that Ukraine might have the DNC server that was hacked by the Russians in the 2016 election. It was correct that Trump aimed to connect the Ukrainians with Giluiani and Barr, even down to the detail of Trump mentioning the two in conjunction. The complaint described Trump as attempting to pressure Ukraine. That is a matter for the impeachment inquiry to resolve, but the details the whistleblower offered to back that up are correct.

Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson overreaches on economic growth claim
","Republicans love praising the Trump economy.  With one of the lowest unemployment rates in years and steady job growth, there’s a lot to boast about.  But just how well does the Trump administration’s overall economic performance compare to his predecessor Barack Obama? And how has the business climate fared under the two presidents? Here’s what U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, claimed in a July 15, 2019 tweet: ""Republican policies have led to business investment growth that’s 10 times faster than what we saw under President Obama.""  The numbers don’t lie, he says. But how exactly is he measuring them? Although the tweet is a bit old, the issue will be an important one in the coming election, so we decided to take a look. The data To come to his conclusion, Johnson’s staff told us he used data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis -- an agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce that measures economic growth. Johnson pointed to statistics measuring ""private fixed investment, nonresidential"" which show how much businesses invest in structures, equipment and intellectual property, such as software and research and development.  Johnson broadly said growth has been 10 times faster under Trump than Obama in his tweet. Those who read it would, presumably think it took in Obama’s entire eight year tenure. But in the data Johnson used, he only compared the final two years of the Obama administration, 2015 and 2016, to a little over the first two years of data for the Trump administration. That approach often signals cherry-picking. Let’s dig deeper. ""We use the final two years of the Obama administration for comparison because it constitutes a comparable length of time with the two years of data for the Trump administration,"" said Ben Voelkel, a spokesman for Johnson. ""It is a time adjacent to, rather than remote from, the Trump years."" According to Johnson’s data points, Obama had an average of 0.6% growth in that period, compared to 6.4% under Trump. The Bureau of Economic Analysis updated the data shortly after Johnson made the statement. In doing so, figures for some of the quarters were slightly adjusted, but the overall trend was largely the same.  The new numbers showed between 2015 and 2016, the Obama administration had an average business investment growth of 0.7%. Meanwhile, between 2017 and 2018 (and the first quarter of 2019), the Trump administration had a growth of about 5.5%. That’s not far off from the original numbers, though quite not as strong.  The full picture Of course, Obama’s term did not start in 2015.  Under the full eight years of the Obama administration, the rate of business investment growth was about 3.7%. When bringing Trump’s term to the overall latest numbers, overall growth has been about 4.9%. So, looking at all of Obama’s tenure, the numbers are much more comparable. What about the beginning of Obama’s term. How does it compare to the beginning of Trump’s term? In Obama’s first two years plus an additional quarter -- the period cited by Johnson -- the business investment rate actually declined by 0.3%. This was the period immediately after the Great Recession. That underscores the volatility of the numbers -- and how the timeframe you pick can make a major difference. Other measures, other factors There are other ways to examine business growth -- and another part of the claim to consider: Johnson asserts the growth was caused by GOP policies. Tara Sinclair, an economics professor at George Washington University, said average growth rates for business investment look stronger in recent years, but when measured as a share of Gross Domestic Product the picture is very similar under both administrations. Why? The nation’s GDP -- a conventional measure of the size of the economy -- has also grown over time. ""The share of GDP going to ‘private fixed investment, nonresidential’ is below the peaks seen in the 1980s and 2000s,"" Sinclair said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Sinclair said GOP policies that cut regulations may have helped lead to stronger business investment under the Trump administration, but it’s hard to blame or credit a presidential administration for most economic outcomes. Indeed, as we have noted time and again in fact checks, experts say it is wrong to attribute too much to individuals or particular policy changes. There are simply too many factors in the economy to boil it down to one. ""As you can see from the data, the quarterly growth rates are quite volatile, so more data to identify a clear trend will be helpful,"" Sinclair told us. Our rating Johnson said ""Republican policies have led to business investment growth that’s 10 times faster than what we saw under President Obama.""  That language may leave the reader thinking the comparison is to Obama’s full term. Johnson, though, said he was only comparing the first two years of Trump to the last two years of Obama. By that measure, there’s an element of truth here. But that element is undermined by the broader picture: When you look at all of Obama’s tenure and other measures, such as share of GDP, the picture is much closer to even between the two. In addition, Johnson over-attributes the cause of recent growth to GOP policies, when there are many other factors at work. Our definition for Mostly False is ""The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC955440>],/factchecks/2019/oct/09/ron-johnson/wisconsin-gop-sen-ron-johnson-overreaches-economy-/

Kelly McGinn invents position for Danica Roem on abortion bill
","Republican challenger Kelly McGinn is sending mailers saying Del. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, backed controversial legislation early this year that would have eased Virginia’s abortion laws. ""Diane Roem supported a controversial bill that would have allowed abortion up until the moment of birth,"" the mailer says. Roem says the claim is untrue, so we fact-checked it. McGinn cites as evidence an unsuccessful bill introduced in January 2019 by Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax. It would have removed a requirement that women undergo an ultrasound and be presented with materials on fetal development and adoption before an abortion. It would have eliminated a mandate that second-term abortions be performed in hospitals.  Most of the debate, however, focused on the bill’s provisions for rare third-trimester abortions, which are allowed if three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy would ""likely"" kill a woman or ""substantially and irremediably"" impair her mental or physical health. The legislation would have lowered the threshold from three physicians to one. That doctor would only have to certify that the pregnancy would damage a woman’s health. The ""substantial and irremediable"" test would have been repealed. Tran, under tough questioning by Republicans during a Jan. 29 hearing, acknowledged that her bill would allow an abortion when a mother is dilating. Many Republicans claim the bill shows that Democrats - as McGinn says - support ""abortion to the time of birth."" But Roem, as first reported by the Prince William Times, has no direct connection to the bill. She was not among 21 Democratic cosponsors of the legislation and she was not a member of a House subcommittee that killed the measure on a partisan 5-3 vote. Roem never voted on the bill. We found no record of her endorsing the bill. Roem says that’s because she never did. Why does McGinn say she supported it? Zac Obermiller, McGinn’s campaign manager, told us the campaign made what it thinks is a safe assumption. ""The McGinn campaign has simply taken Del. Roem at her word regarding her heretofore unqualified and full-throated support for abortion rights throughout all nine months,"" he wrote in an email. Obermiller noted that Roem is among 40 legislators endorsed in August by Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia for having ""a 100% voting record in support of sexual and reproductive health and rights."" He also noted that Roem has received $12,000 in campaign contributions since 2017 from Emily’s List, a pro-abortion rights PAC, according to records of the Virginia Public Access Project. But Roem told us told us she would have voted against Tran’s bill if she’d had a chance because, when she went back to her district after the measure died, voters told her they disliked the legislation. ""That’s what you do as a legislator; you represent your constituents,"" she said. Obermiller said Roem is being disingenuous. ""The bottom line is that Delegate Roem wants to have her cake and eat it too,"" he said. Our ruling McGinn says Roem ""supported a controversial bill that would have allowed abortion up until the moment of birth."" No question, Roem is a strong supporter of abortion rights and is backed by pro-abortion rights interest groups. But she did not have an opportunity to vote on the controversial bill McGinn cites and was not among 21 Democratic co-sponsors of the measure. McGinn offers no evidence Roem was backed the bill and says it’s safe to assume that she would have voted for it. Roem says she would have opposed it based on feedback from her constituents. There’s plenty for the candidates to debate on abortion. But McGinn doesn’t get to make up a convenient record for her opponent. We rate McGinn’s statement False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7F5580>],/factchecks/2019/oct/09/kelly-mcginn/kelly-mcginn-invents-position-danica-roem-abortion/

Could West Virginians be out $70,000 a year under the Green New Deal?
","Republicans have focused their attacks on a congressional Democratic proposal known as the Green New Deal.  The proposal, whose highest-profile champion is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is aimed at curbing climate change, but Republicans counter that its associated costs will wreck the economy. The House version of the proposal has far-reaching environmental goals, including ""eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible."" It reaches into other domestic policy areas, as well.  One of the GOP lawmakers who took a shot at the Green New Deal is West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito.  Capito took the proposal to task in an Aug. 20 Facebook post: ""Democrats are desperate to implement their Green New Deal. They care little about the cost and will leave you with the bill! A study shows that households neighboring West Virginia could be on the hook for upwards of $70,000 in the first year alone under the Green New Deal! This doesn’t sound like much of a deal to us!""   Capito’s congressional and campaign offices declined to comment for this article, but her Facebook post linked to a Fox Business article that, in turn, cited a study by the Competitive Enterprise Institute on the household effects of the Green New Deal, or GND. ""At a minimum, the GND would impose large and recurring costs on American households,"" the study said. ""We conclude that in four of the five states analyzed — Florida, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania — the GND would cost a typical household more than $70,000 in the first year of implementation, approximately $45,000 for each of the next four years, and more than $37,000 each year thereafter.""  Pennsylvanians could expect a $72,439 hit. In the fifth state, Alaska, the costs would be the highest of all. Travis Burk, a CEI spokesman, said Capito’s Facebook statement ""accurately described"" the study. ""The study looked at the available data in those states and estimated increased costs for electricity production, upgrading vehicles and housing, and elements of shipping,"" Burk said. ""In the interest of fairness, the study is transparent about the inability to estimate a price tag for several of the more costly but vaguely-worded elements of the plan, including a universal job guarantee and guaranteed retirement security for all."" Adding in those other elements would mean that Capito was ""underestimating the potential costs,"" Burk said. There is little doubt that a proposal as sweeping as the Green New Deal would come with a significant price tag. Where Capito’s assertion falls short is in its specificity. The Competitive Enterprise Institute is ""dedicated to advancing the principles of limited government, free enterprise, and individual liberty,"" according to its website — so it’s not surprising that the group would be skeptical of a pro-regulatory plan like the Green New Deal. More to the point, Capito glosses over some of the study’s shortcomings. The Green New Deal is an aspirational blueprint rather than a binding piece of legislation. The proposal doesn’t lay out any cost figures. And it has not received a cost estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — the gold-standard source on such estimates. As a result, the details of the proposal are vague and open to a range of interpretations. The study itself acknowledges that its calculations require ""a considerable number of assumptions"" — assumptions that other policy specialists say will make specific figures hard to pin down. We have previously fact-checked a statement that, ""at $93 trillion, the Green New Deal would cost more than the entire recorded spending of the U.S. since the Constitution went into effect in 1789."" The $93 trillion figure comes from a high-end estimate by a conservative group, the American Action Forum. The CEI study that Capito relied on cited the American Action Forum as a ""key source"" for its own calculations. As we noted at the time, the American Action Forum report described its estimates as an ""initial foray,"" filled with assumptions and caveats. The Green New Deal ""lacks too many details to seriously model,"" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told PolitiFact West Virginia. Capito wrote that ""a study shows that households neighboring West Virginia could be on the hook for upwards of $70,000 in the first year alone under the Green New Deal!""  Capito cites a study by an anti-regulation group that estimated that the one-year cost to a household in neighboring Pennsylvania would be $72,439.  However, experts warn that the costs associated with the Green New Deal are too fuzzy at this point to come up with detailed cost estimates. This position is echoed by the report itself, which acknowledges that its calculations require ""a considerable number of assumptions."" It’s also worth noting that the resolution would be non-binding — if it actually manages to secure congressional approval. We rate the statement Mostly False.

Ryan says six studies say the math works in Romney tax plan
","
Mitt Romney’s tax plan plays a vital role in his economic program. He says it by itself will create seven million new jobs. He has been defending his proposal ever since economists at the Tax Policy Center -- a team with both Republican and Democratic connections -- said the numbers in Romney’s plan do not add up. The Obama campaign has relied on that study to attack Romney in television ads and on the stump.

In the vice presidential debate, the moderator pressed Paul Ryan to fill in the missing details that would allow a clear assessment of what the tax changes might do. Ryan did not provide any but claimed other analysts confirm that the plan will accomplish everything it promises.

""Six studies have verified that this math adds up,"" Ryan said.

This is a claim that Romney and Ryan first made in early September, although back then, they cited five studies. We rated it Mostly False because two of the ""studies"" were actually Wall Street Journal editorials and one was double-counting another research paper.

Since then, the campaign has dropped the two editorials and added additional research for the new claim of six studies. For this fact check, we are building on our previous work and examining the claim in light of the additional studies being cited.

The basics of Romney’s plan

Briefly, Romney’s plan would cut individual and corporate rates, and eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. This would put the government in the hole about $5 trillion over 10 years, but Romney would offset that by doing away with deductions, exemptions, credits and other wrinkles in the tax code that currently give people a tax break. Some of the largest ones are the home mortgage deduction and the tax-free treatment of employer health benefits.

Romney is clear about the tax cuts, but is largely silent about how he would offset them with reductions in tax breaks. However, he promises that the plan will be revenue neutral and it won’t shift the tax burden from the very rich to the middle class.

The six studies

Before we go through the list, we should note that all of the studies, both those supporting Romney’s plan and the one from the Tax Policy Center, speculate on the details of the deductions and tax breaks that Romney would reduce or eliminate. Martin Feldstein, in the first study, says ""It is impossible to calculate the exact effects of the future reforms since Gov. Romney hasn't specified what he would do.""

Curtis Dubay, the author of the newest study we examine, says (Romney’s) ""plan would offset the revenue loss from those changes by broadening the tax base in unspecified ways."" In short, all analysts must fill in the blanks. This is akin to trying on a pair of pants before both legs are done.

1 & 2.  Martin Feldstein, Harvard University ""Romney’s tax plan can raise revenue"" and ""A reply to comments""

Feldstein, an adviser to the Romney campaign, uses 2009 IRS data to demonstrate that Romney can meet all his goals and not increase taxes on the middle class. First he estimates the lost revenue due to Romney’s 20 percent across the board rate cut and the elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax. Feldstein figures that would be $186 billion.

Next, he looks at how much could be gained by reducing or eliminating deductions.

At this point, he makes an important decision. He defines high-income as households making $100,000 or more. The Tax Policy Center sets the bar at $200,000 and anyone making less is part of the middle class. By choosing the broader definition, Feldstein has a lot more revenue to work with.

In 2009, Feldstein says, the total value of itemized deductions for households making $100,000 and up was about $636 billion. By his estimate, if you eliminate those deductions, the IRS stands to gain about $191 billion. ""More than enough to offset the revenue losses from the individual income tax cuts proposed by Gov. Romney,"" Feldstein says.

Feldstein underscores that he isn’t advocating such a move. He only notes that eliminating deductions, or broadening the tax base as it is called, can net huge returns.

In his second piece, Feldstein defends treating households making $100,000 or more as ""high-income"" because they are in the upper 20 percent of income earners. He offers more details on the tax breaks that could be reduced for this group, such as tax-free health benefits and the child tax credit.

The response

Feldstein’s definition of middle class is at odds with the one Mitt Romney has used. In an ABC interview, Romney said people making $200,000 or less are part of the middle class and would be protected in his plan.

The Tax Policy Center notes that Feldstein needs to go after the deductions used by less affluent people -- those making between $100,000 and $200,000 -- in order to make the books balance.

The center analysts also notes that this assumes these people would not be allowed to take even the basic standard deduction. The group further challenges Feldstein’s use of the 30 percent tax rate, saying a more accurate estimate is 24 percent which would leave Feldstein $70 billion short of the revenues lost through the rest of Romney’s tax cuts. (In his response, Feldstein says he could use the lower rate and still make the numbers work by going after other tax breaks.)

3. Harvey Rosen, Princeton University ""Growth, distribution and tax reform: Thoughts on the Romney proposal""

Rosen’s main point is that any assessment of the Romney tax plan that ignores its impact on economic growth is incomplete.  

""This is curious,"" Rosen said, ""because increasing growth is the motivation for the proposal in the first place."" Growth creates more income for the government to tax which would help offset the revenues lost through rate cuts.

Rosen readily admits that no one can accurately predict the future so he runs the numbers using three growth rates for GDP - 3 percent, 5 percent and 7 percent. By comparison, the White House budget planners assume an average rate of close to 3 percent.

Like Feldstein, he used 2009 data. Unlike Feldstein, he analyzed what happens for taxpayers making $100,000 and up, and then repeated it for those making $200,000 and up.

Rosen found that when all possible deductions are eliminated, from home mortgages to charitable giving to health insurance benefits, it means that increased revenues can balance out the money lost through tax cuts.

There is only one scenario where Rosen saw a wrinkle -- when households making less than $200,000 are shielded from the loss of deductions under certain tax and growth assumptions. Rosen saw a $28 billion gap and said ""maintaining an approximately constant tax burden on high-income individuals would be more challenging."" But not ""mathematically impossible.""

The response

The criticism that the Tax Policy Center failed to account for growth is incorrect. William Gale, one of the center’s economists who was on the Council of Economic Advisers for President George H.W. Bush, says the team specifically tested their results using different assumptions of economic growth.

""Incorporating the growth effects did not change the conclusion,"" Gale said.

The center said groups including the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation take a cautious approach on assuming that tax changes alone will lead to new growth. This is particularly true when tax cuts are combined with base-broadening, which lies at the heart of the Romney plan.

Both Rosen and Feldstein use 2009 data. Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California Berkeley, said 2009 presents problems for analysts. 2009 was the bottom of the recession. In pure dollar amounts, upper income households saw huge investment losses in 2008.  When the stock market recovered, they offset those gains with losses from the year before.

In 2009, they had less income that would benefit from the lower rates Romney proposes.

Accordingly, the cost of a tax cut would be smaller and so would the amount you would need to pick up by getting rid of tax deductions and other tax breaks as Romney has said he wants.

Auerbach said 2009 would be a relatively easy year to make the numbers work.

4. Matt Jensen, American Enterprise Institute, ""How the Tax Policy Center could improve its Romney tax study""

Jensen challenges the Tax Policy Center findings on two fronts. First, he said it should have considered the elimination of two tax breaks that the center’s analysts said ""were off the table."" One is the interest on state and local bonds; the other is interest on life insurance policies.

""Both of these exclusions largely benefit the wealthy,"" Jensen said. ""Added together their repeal would net upwards of $90 billion that could be redistributed to lower-income individuals."" Jensen called his analysis ""nothing if not rough.""

Jensen also said the center’s definition of who is high-income is arbitrary. Rather than declare everyone over $200,000 as high income, he suggested the center show the lowest income level at which the Romney plan  would work out mathematically.

The response

The Tax Policy Center challenged Jensen’s ""rough"" number. It said a more accurate figure would be $25 billion.

5. Alex Brill, American Enterprise Institute, ""The Romney tax plan: Not a tax hike on the middle class""

Brill also faults the Tax Policy Center for ignoring the impact of growth, but he has three specific criticisms. He says the center made mistakes in how it dealt with taxes related to the health care reform law and gains made on insurance policies. Brill also says the center ignored the option to tax earnings from state and local bonds.

The total value of these changes, Brill says, brings the Romney plan within $12 billion of balancing out.

The response

As with the other studies, Brill is off the mark in saying the Tax Policy Center ignored the impact of growth. On his specific criticisms, he finds support for two of them from Josh Barro, a columnist with Bloomberg News who agrees that the Obamacare taxes and life insurance gains should be folded into the picture.

But on state and local bonds, Barro disagrees. He says Brill has exaggerated the potential money in this pot. Brill said it would be $20 billion. Barro says only about $5 billion of that goes to bondholders. Following the cash gets complicated very quickly but bottom line, Barro warns that if these bonds are not tax free, then state and local governments would pay more to borrow money.

""A key effect would be state and local governments raising taxes (mostly not on the wealthy) to pay higher interest costs,"" Barro wrote.

6. Curtis Dubay, Heritage Foundation, ""The Tax Policy Center’s skewed analysis of Governor Romney’s tax plan""

Dubay relies on three of the studies already listed, from Feldstein, Rosen and Jensen, but adds a new criticism of the Tax Policy Center study. Dubay says the center failed to make adjustment what is called the ""step-up in basis"" from inherited assets.

Take the example of inheriting stock from your mother. Under Romney’s plan, there would be no estate tax. If you sold the stock, you would owe taxes on any profit. That profit, Dubay says, should be based on the value of the stock when your mother bought it, not its value when you inherited it. The difference is called a ""step-up"" and getting rid of it makes a lot more money taxable.

The Tax Policy Center did not count on this, producing a ""critical error"" that ""significantly  biases"" the results, Dubay says. He estimated the value at $19 billion.

The response

Gale with the Tax Policy Center says Dubay’s change would not generate the revenues he predicts for two reasons. First, not all the inherited property would be sold and for any that wasn’t, no tax would be collected. Second, Dubay uses the current tax rates to calculate the tax collections, but Romney would cut those rates and so the amount of revenues would drop.

Our ruling

Ryan said that six studies verify that the numbers in the Romney tax plan add up. Hearing that, you might think that each is independent research. But not all studies are created equal and these come from people or groups with ties to Romney.

Two of those studies come from Feldstein, a Romney campaign adviser. Three come from conservative think tanks, the Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute, which have analysts who advise the Romney campaign. While every analyst would insist that they make their own judgments, the Tax Policy Center is fully independent of the Obama campaign.

The studies from Feldstein and Rosen use 2009 data. That was an abnormal year and one that made it easier to make the math work for the Romney plan. The analysts could have chosen other years but decided not to.

Of the studies that examine the middle class tax burden, none shows conclusively that households making less than $200,000 would be spared a tax increase. That is a group of taxpayers that Romney defines as middle class and says he would protect.

None of the studies can accurately model Romney’s tax plan because he has said so little about how he would pay for it. As a result, all of them make assumptions as to what tax breaks might be reduced. They can speak in rough terms about a concept, but they can not verify a plan when no detailed plan exists.

We see no more than one fully independent study out of the six claimed. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA29600>],/factchecks/2012/oct/15/paul-ryan/ryan-says-six-studies-say-math-works-romney-tax-pl/
"['National', 'Medicaid', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama ad says Romney raised nursing home fees eight times in Mass.
","
A new Obama campaign ad urges middle-class voters to pay attention to Medicaid, the government health program most commonly known for providing care to the poor, and to the changes Mitt Romney will make to it.

Against images of middle-age couples caring for elderly parents, a narrator says ""It’s one of the hardest decisions a family can make, realizing a nursing home is the only choice.""

It continues, ""for many middle-class families, Medicaid is the only way to afford the care. But as a governor Mitt Romney raised nursing home fees eight times, and as president his budget cuts Medicaid by one-third and burdens families with the cost of nursing home care.""

""We have a president who won’t let that happen,"" the narrator concludes, as images appear of Obama interacting with seniors.

We decided to check the facts about Romney’s decisions about nursing home fees while governor of Massachusetts.

Medicaid and the middle class

First, some background. Medicare is the government health care program for seniors, who pay into it during their working years through payroll taxes. It covers Americans 65 and older, with hospital stays, doctor visits and prescription drugs.

It does not, however, pay for long-term nursing home care. So middle-class people end up turning to Medicaid to pay for that care once they’ve exhausted their own finances.

The two presidential candidates have starkly different plans for the program. Obama, through his signature health care law, plans to expand the program to help more poor people get health coverage by raising income limits for who can qualify.

Romney wants to convert the program to a block grant administered by the states. Critics say the resulting funding cuts will force states to tighten eligibility and ultimately drop people from the program.

 Back in Massachusetts

As backup for the claim about nursing home fees, the Obama campaign cited increases Romney implemented to the cost of state licenses for nursing homes of different sizes.

The fees increased on a scale according to the number of beds in each nursing home facility. They went up as follows:

• 1 to 30 beds, from $95 to $285;
• 31 to 60 beds, from $160 to $480;  
• 61 to 90 beds, from $225 to $675;
• 91 to 120 beds, from $295 to $885;
• 121 to 150 beds, from $360 to $1,080;  
• 151 to 200 beds, from $425 to $1,275;
• more than 200 beds, from $495 to $1,485.

In addition, Romney established a $9.60 per day user fee on nursing home beds not covered by Medicare. The money was meant to be returned to the nursing homes in the form of higher Medicaid reimbursement rates.

The Romney campaign acknowledged the fee increases on nursing home licenses but took issue with the ""eight times"" characterization. We agree: The fees were not raised eight times -- they were raised once, on seven different levels of nursing homes in mid-2003, which was also when the user fee was implemented.

We also find it misleading to connect this fee increase with the statement that ""for many middle-class families, Medicaid is the only way to afford (nursing home) care."" But the licensing fees were charged to nursing home providers, not Medicaid beneficiaries. While it’s reasonable that increased operating costs could have an effect on patients down the line, or even force some facilities out of business, Medicaid benefits were not directly affected by the fee increases.

Our ruling

Obama’s ad says that ""for many middle-class families, Medicaid is the only way to afford nursing home care. But as a governor, Mitt Romney raised nursing home fees eight times.""

It would be more accurate to say Romney raised the licensing fee for seven levels of nursing facilities one time, in addition to the per-day bed tax. And all the fees were levied on the nursing homes themselves, not the middle class families struggling to afford nursing home care mentioned in the ad.

Both those elements of the statement are inaccurate and misleading. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD65A40>],/factchecks/2012/oct/15/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-romney-raised-nursing-home-fees-eigh/

Paul Ryan says the Obama administration ‘watered down sanctions’ against Iran
","
President Barack Obama’s administration ""has no credibility"" to challenge Iran’s nuclear aspirations, Rep. Paul Ryan argued in his debate with vice presidential rival Joe Biden.

The pair outlined a sharp difference in approach to Iran as they sat side by side in Danville, Ky., on Oct. 11, 2012.

The Wisconsin Republican, answering a question from moderator Martha Raddatz about using a military strike to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, argued:

""In order to solve this peacefully -- which is everybody's goal -- you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds. Look at where they are. They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. It's because this administration has no credibility on this issue. It's because this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop us from putting the tough sanctions in place. Now we have them in place because of Congress.""

We can’t read the ayatollahs’ minds, but we checked whether the Obama administration ""watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop (Congress) from putting the tough sanctions in place.""

We found Ryan was oversimplifying a difference of opinion between Congress and the White House not over whether to pressure Iran — but the most effective way to go about it.

 Sanctions against Iran

First, a little background. Iran has faced U.S. sanctions since its 1979 Islamic revolution. The United Nations and other nations have joined in sanctions since 2006 in response to Iran’s efforts to develop a nuclear weapon, according to the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan analysis to Congress. The Obama administration’s policy has been to combine sanctions with negotiations, seeking ""additional U.S., U.N., and allied country sanctions whose cumulative effect could compel Iran to accept a nuclear bargain.""

The country now has the ""most sweeping sanctions on Iran of virtually any country in the world,"" according to a February 2012 Congressional Research Service report. Last month’s report calls them ""what many now consider to be ‘crippling’ sanctions.""

So, what’s Ryan’s argument? The Romney-Ryan campaign pointed us to news coverage of an Obama administration compromise in 2010 to earn China and Russia’s backing for new sanctions through the United Nations.

The U.N. Security Council in 2010 voted to sanction Iran but didn’t include among those sanctions measures against the nation’s Central Bank because of opposition from the two nations, which have veto power on the council.

The Obama administration instead said it would also push forward with tougher sanctions on its own. And indeed, Obama has signed into law several rounds of legislation and executive orders strengthening the U.S. position.

(For a detailed look at U.S. sanctions against Iran, the Congressional Research Service regularly updates its report with new legislation and enforcement actions.)

 Ryan: Credit Congress, not Obama

The Romney-Ryan campaign argues that Congress deserves credit for much of that, such as legislation targeting the Central Bank. A spokesman for Romney told PolitiFact in February that tougher sanctions imposed by the United States earlier this year ""weren’t done by Obama,"" but through an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that Obama opposed, tried to water down, and won exceptions for.

""In implementing them, he was only doing what he was required to by an act of Congress,"" Romney spokesman Ryan Williams told us.

Meanwhile, Obama wrote a signing statement saying that the sanction’s requirements were nonbinding, Williams noted. (Obama wrote that the Iran sanctions section ""would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations by directing the Executive to take certain positions in negotiations or discussions with foreign governments. Like section 1244, should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities, I will treat the provisions as non-binding."")

Obama also undermined the sanctions’ requirement for countries seeking exceptions to ""significantly reduce"" their Iranian crude oil purchases by leaving the definition of ""significant"" to the discretion of the secretary of state, Williams said. (Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., and Mark Kirk, R-Ill., authors of the amendment, argued it should mean at least 18 percent.)

The president issued exceptions to 20 of the top oil exporters from Iran, including China, the Romney-Ryan team said, citing a June 2012 New York Times article.

For its part, meanwhile, the Obama administration argued that the amendment, which passed despite the administration's objections, could ""alienate foreign countries, make it more difficult to pressure Iran and raise oil prices, which could actually help the Iranian economy,"" according to Foreign Policy’s The Cable.

 Experts: A push for flexibility, not weakness

After decades of U.S. sanctions, there’s little left to ban between the United States and Iran, so new rules necessarily target other countries. But move too fast, and the United States risks losing the cooperation of nations it needs as allies in the wider push to isolate Iran, experts told us.

Congress wants a crackdown; the executive branch wants diplomacy.

Iran policy experts told us that while the Obama administration pushed back against Congress — including what you might call watering down and delaying enforcement of legislative initiatives — that doesn’t mean the administration wasn’t tough on Iran.

Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations, an independent, nonpartisan think-tank,  told PolitiFact earlier this year that’s not evidence the Obama administration had a weak stance on Iran, it's just that Obama resisted letting Congress dictate the terms.

""Flexibility is the watchword,"" he said. ""It's really hard to argue that this administration hasn't brought strong pressure to bear on Iran.""

Leonard Spector of the Monterey Institute of International Studies at Middlebury College told us in February that the administration has been a driving force internationally to put pressure on Iran, even if it failed to get the U.N. to target Iran’s Central Bank.

""Obama, unilaterally and in concert with the (European Union) and other allies, has gone much further,""  he said.

Avner Cohen, a senior fellow at the Monterey Institute of International Studies and a Democrat, has told us it's legitimate to raise questions about whether the administration should have acted sooner to impose its own tougher sanctions. But he said it's more valuable to get other nations to join the effort.

""To make something effective in the real world, it needs to pass the Security Council,"" he said.

It’s true, he said, that the the administration ""had to water down some of the language to pass it."" But Ryan’s claim is ""totally out of context,"" he concluded.

James Jeffrey, a deputy national security adviser in the Bush administration and ambassador to Iraq and Turkey under Obama, said this kind of back-and-forth between Congress and the executive branch happens all the time. Congress wants to exert unilateral pressure, and the executive needs room for diplomacy with its allies.

You could just as easily characterize what Ryan calls watering down as the Obama team ""strengthening the ability to enforce"" sanctions against Iran, he said.

In fact, the United States and European Union, among others, are now putting so much economic pressure on the country that ""many judge that Iran might soon decide it needs a nuclear compromise to produce an easing of sanctions,"" according to the Congressional Research Service’s September report.

 Our ruling

Ryan argued that ""this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop (Congress) from putting the tough sanctions in place."" He’s right that the Obama administration compromised with Russia and China to earn their backing in the U.N. Security Council, and pushed for legislative waivers and other flexibility from Congress as it organized an international coalition to counter Iran.

But just because the administration resisted plans in Congress does not mean it failed to get tough sanctions imposed. In fact, that international diplomacy has resulted in ""what many now consider to be ‘crippling’ sanctions."" In fact, there’s now so much economic pressure on Iran that Congress’ research arm reports Iran may soon decide to seek a nuclear compromise.

That’s the opposite of what Ryan’s critique suggests. He employs a sliver of truth in service of a misleading impression. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDB4480>],/factchecks/2012/oct/15/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-obama-administration-watered-down-s/

Did Mary Nolan secure funding for Milwaukie bridge project?
","
It’s been nearly 40 years since Portlanders have seen a new bridge constructed over the Willamette River. That will change soon with the addition of the Milwaukie light rail bridge, scheduled to be up and running by fall 2015.

Once the deck starts going up and the cables are attached, it’ll be one of the most visible public works projects for the city in some time. It’s little wonder, then, that Portland City Council candidate Mary Nolan is touting on her website her role in making it happen.

""We’re building the first new bridge across the Willamette in more than 40 years, this one dedicated to transit, pedestrian and bike traffic,"" she writes on her website. ""As Co-Chair of the Joint Ways & Means Committee, I secured the key piece of funding for this important project.""

We see a lot of claims like these -- where folks who sat on a committee claim some crucial role. Sometimes it’s real, sometimes it’s a stretch. We wondered what the situation was here.

We called TriMet to figure out what the deal was with the Legislature’s funding contribution for the project. Spokeswoman Mary Fetsch pointed us to House Bill 5036 from 2007, which authorized $250 million worth of lottery bonds for the project. The funding at the state level was itself instrumental in securing matching federal dollars.

Back in 2007, Nolan was, indeed, a co-chair of the budget writing committee, along with now-Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore. It’s fair to say that, as co-chairs of the committee, they had final say on how the dollars were spent.

We wondered, though, just how big a role Nolan played in this particular get for the city of Portland. We spoke with TriMet lobbyist Olivia Clark. She described the process as a group effort. She ticked off several names -- Rep. Carolyn Tomei, Rep. Dave Hunt, now-U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, now-Secretary of State Kate Brown and Schrader -- as essential in getting the funding secured.

As for Nolan, she called the candidate’s involvement ""vital.""

""She was definitely a leader in the effort,"" Clark said.

On Clark’s advice, we also spoke with Schrader, who confirmed Nolan’s role in the effort as essential saying that ""Mary was big on this piece.""

When we spoke with Nolan, she talked about how she had held firm on getting the full amount in 2007 -- even after the governor’s office had pushed to hold off until 2009 or to split the sum between two bienniums. ""I said ‘No’ and Schrader backed me up,"" Nolan said. ""It was critical for the metropolitan region.""

Clark, the lobbyist, recalled a similar negotiation when we spoke with her earlier.

Nolan said she ""secured the key piece of funding"" for the  Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project bridge. It might be nice if that read ""helped secure"" instead -- it was certainly a group effort. But based on committee assignments and interviews with two people closest to the negotiations, it does appear that Nolan played a key role.

We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD51F00>],/factchecks/2012/oct/15/mary-nolan/did-mary-nolan-really-secure-funding-new-bridge-pr/

Barack Obama says economists' studies don't back up Mitt Romney's tax promises
","
The debate about Mitt Romney's tax plan has centered on its lack of specifics. The Tax Policy Center has said Romney hasn't offered enough cuts or revenue to pay for his tax reductions. But Romney has said reports by economists show the plan will add up.

Two of the reports Romney touted to support his view were by Harvey Rosen, a Princeton University economist who served as chairman of President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, and by Martin Feldstein, a Harvard University economist and former adviser to President Ronald Reagan.

In an email to supporters, President Barack Obama tried to turn the tables by using their work to contradict Romney.

""Even the studies that Romney has cited to claim his plan adds up still show he would need to raise middle-class taxes,"" the Obama campaign said. ""In fact, Harvard economist Martin Feldstein and Princeton economist Harvey Rosen both concede that paying for Romney’s tax cuts would require large tax increases on families making between $100,000 and $200,000.""

Really? The experts cited by Romney actually agree with Obama? We decided to explore whether Obama was right. 
We read both economists' writings and didn't see any such claims. In fact, after the Obama campaign sent its email, Rosen told the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, that the Obama campaign was twisting what he said.

We won’t try to determine whether Rosen or Feldstein are right with their analysis, though we have previously written that their study is not as detailed as the Tax Policy Center analysis. However, in this item, we have a more limited mission -- to see whether the Obama campaign has accurately characterized their findings. 
Rosen’s study

As we noted in a previous item, Rosen’s paper used 2009 data to analyze what happens under Romney's plan. Rosen found that when a wide array of tax breaks are eliminated -- from home mortgages to charitable giving to health insurance benefits -- and projected economic growth rates are factored in that the increased revenues can balance out the money lost through tax rate cuts for high-income taxpayers.

Rosen looked at several scenarios and found that most of them enabled Romney to keep his promises. But Rosen found one in which he the numbers fell short of balance by $28 billion. He wrote that Romney’s ability to stick to each of his promises in this scenario ""would be more challenging,"" but not ""mathematically impossible.""

Rosen told us that when he used the term ""more challenging,"" he was ""referring to identifying other tax preferences that haven’t received much attention in the debate so far. For example, currently, capital gains on assets that are bequeathed to heirs when an individual dies are not subject to tax. This is clearly a tax preference that benefits primarily upper income individuals, so scaling it back would also help fill the gap.""

When we contacted the Obama campaign, they pointed us to a Bloomberg article that quoted Rosen.

""Mitt Romney says he can lower income-tax rates by 20 percent without costing the U.S. government revenue and without making the middle class carry a bigger share of the tax load,"" the article said. ""He’s right -- assuming that Congress eliminates the most widely used deductions by taxpayers earning more than $100,000 a year, says Harvey Rosen, an economics professor at Princeton University whose study Romney cites as evidence that his plan is viable. … ‘What the political system would find feasible, I don’t know,’ Rosen says. ‘It’s mathematically possible.’""

Rosen told PolitiFact that the view attributed to him in the Bloomberg article isn’t inconsistent with what he wrote in his paper.

""All the Obama campaign is really saying is that tax reform is hard,"" Rosen said. ""Well, that’s true -- but it’s also totally obvious. If that’s all  the Tax Policy Center had claimed, then I would never have bothered to write my paper. The Tax Policy Center went way beyond that when it claimed that the Romney proposal is ‘mathematically impossible.’ That sounds a lot cooler than ‘politically difficult,’ but as my paper argues, under plausible assumptions, ‘mathematically impossible’ is not correct.""

Feldstein’s study

Meanwhile, Feldstein, a Romney adviser, used 2009 data from the IRS to demonstrate that Romney can meet all his goals and not increase taxes on the middle class.

""Mitt Romney's plan to cut taxes and offset the resulting revenue loss by limiting tax breaks has been attacked as ‘mathematically impossible,’"" Feldstein wrote. Romney’s plan, ""say critics, would require a large tax increase on the middle-class to avoid raising the deficit. Careful analysis shows this is not the case.""

In an interview with PolitiFact, Feldstein noted that his analysis didn’t separate out data for earners between $100,000 and $200,000. That means the Obama campaign is incorrect to say Feldstein argues that ""large tax increases on families making between $100,000 and $200,000"" would be needed. Feldstein’s data doesn’t address that income range.

""I did the analysis treating the middle-class families as those below the top 20 percent -- those below $100,000,"" Feldstein said. ""I didn't calculate the average tax increase for those in the $100,000 to $200,000. So I cannot say that (the Obama campaign is) right or wrong about the $100,000 to $200,000 families. But I think it is fair to say that those with incomes in the top 20 percent of the distribution are relatively affluent and should not be counted as the middle class.""

Our ruling

The Obama email claimed that Rosen and Feldstein have said that ""paying for (Mitt) Romney’s tax cuts would require large tax increases on families making between $100,000 and $200,000."" 
But Feldstein’s analysis didn’t look at the income range the Obama campaign said it did, and in Rosen’s case, the Obama campaign has overplayed its hand. At the very least, Rosen’s work could be interpreted as saying that tax increases on middle-income voters could be needed -- not would be needed -- and Rosen never characterized any such increases as ""large.""

Either way, both economists’ analyses include clearly worded passages that disagree with the Obama campaign’s claim that middle-class tax increases would be ""required"" under a Romney plan.

"['Elections', 'Negative Campaigning', 'Wisconsin', 'Tommy Thompson']","
Thompson says Baldwin has not run any positive ads in Senate campaign
","
Former Gov. Tommy Thompson won the bruising Republican primary for U.S. Senate. And the general election race against Democrat Tammy Baldwin has featured plenty of punches from both sides.

Thompson was asked about negative advertising during an Oct. 5, 2012, appearance at a Milwaukee Press Club Newsmaker Luncheon. He expressed disappointment, and said the tone didn’t reflect his personality.

""I’m very sad about the negative ads,"" Thompson said. ""I’m a positive guy. I’m optimistic.""

He noted that when he successfully challenged Democrat Gov. Anthony Earl in 1986, the two ""ran a fantastic election, we ran an election all over the state and that always was positive.""

And then Thompson turned the blame on his opponent.

""Congresswoman Baldwin has had not one positive ad. Not one.... Not one positive ad. Why? Because she hasn’t done anything.""

A few days after the statement, the Journal Sentinel’s Craig Gilbert wrote about 
a report by Kantar Media CMAG, a D.C. firm that tracks political ads, that found in the 30 days that ended Oct. 2, 2012, 92% of the ads aired in the race were ""negative.""

What’s more, the report showed that in the weeks after the primary, between Aug. 19 and Sept. 17, 2012, Baldwin and her allies outspent Thompson and his allies almost 3-to-1 on broadcast television.

Complaining and finger-pointing about the tone of the race is nothing new in politics. But Thompson made a very specific claim about Baldwin, and suggested she is to blame for the negativity.

Is he on the money?

To be sure, the battle for the U.S. Senate seat was bitter long before the general election, but only on the Republican side. Thompson topped three opponents in the August primary, while Baldwin faced no opponent, though she has been on television since early summer.

That split nature of the race creates a bit of a problem when it comes to evaluating Thompson’s claim.

Was Thompson talking about the entirety of the campaign or was he referring to the head-to-head battle with Baldwin?

From the context of the specific question, about how negative ads had erased Thompson’s lead in the polls, it’s reasonable to believe Thompson was speaking about ads in the general election race. And he referred to the general election campaign that he waged against former Gov. Earl.

But that’s not what he said -- Thompson said all of Baldwin’s ads had been negative.

We asked his campaign to provide backup for his statement and was told they would get back to us but didn’t.

So, let’s start with the primary season.

That’s when Baldwin was able to play Rock-Paper-Engines. Those were the titles of her TV ads.

A June 17, 2012, ad, ""Paper"", discussed Baldwin’s efforts to sanction China for breaking trade rules and hurting the U.S. paper industry. The ""Rock,""ad, which began running July 9, was biographical in nature. On July 30, 2012, ""Engines""began, claiming Baldwin ""led the fight"" to force the Coast Guard to buy engines from American manufacturers.

None of those ads mentioned Thompson or the other Republican contenders.

That tone changed after the Aug. 14, 2012, primary, starting the following week with an ad called ""Choice.""

In it, Baldwin talks about three tax-cut votes of her own, and then turns her sights on Thompson, calling him ""the guy who’s gotten rich working for D.C. lobbyists"" and saying he ""wants to give a $265,000 tax cut to millionaires like himself while raising taxes on the middle class.""

She followed up a few days later with another ad criticizing Thompson for refusing to release his tax returns.

In an early September ad, Baldwin attacked Thompson’s record as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The ad said Thompson ""cut a sweetheart deal with drug companies making it illegal for them to negotiate lower prescription drug prices.""

So, since the primary, the ads have been negative. The same can be said of Thompson’s ads.

Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus noted Thompson vowed numerous times that he would run a positive campaign. He argued Thompson was the first to go negative against Baldwin, even before the primary and cited a July ad, ""Repeal""showing Thompson on a Harley.

In it, Thompson pledges to be the ""51st vote"" to repeal ""Obamacare."" Baldwin’s face appears briefly superimposed on the road, with the note she supports the federal health care law. (There is no question about that. She voted for it and has even suggested going further.)

As with the Baldwin side, the negative lines become much clearer after the primary.

In other ads, Thompson has said Baldwin supports a massive tax increase, describes her as ""too extreme for Wisconsin,"" and says she’s more liberal than Nancy Pelosi and President Barack Obama.

Groups on both sides of the race have also ran negative ads, contributing to the all-negative sense about the race.

Our rating

At the Press Club event, Thompson said Baldwin had not aired ""one positive ad"" in the campaign.

That is certainly true for the general election, and it’s reasonable to assume that’s what he was referring to. But a longer view of the campaign, extending before the primary, provides a very different picture.

We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFCE100>],/factchecks/2012/oct/15/tommy-thompson/thompson-says-baldwin-has-not-run-any-positive-ads/
"['New Jersey', 'Candidate Biography', 'Income', 'Voting Record', 'Joseph Kyrillos']","
Joe Kyrillos said when he voted against minimum wage hike, it was in the 1980s
","
Republican U.S. Senate candidate Joe Kyrillos said he thinks the state’s lowest-paid workers deserve a raise.

But incumbent U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, a Democrat, accused Kyrillos of reversing course on that position. The two will face off in the Nov. 6 election.

""Listen, you had the opportunity, you know, you just can't flip back and forth. You've become the biggest flip flopper. Now it's that you want to vote for the minimum wage increase but you voted against it when you had the opportunity. Why'd you vote against it?"" Menendez said during a heated debate on New Jersey 101.5-FM on Wednesday night.

""I already said. You look at -- I think when I voted against it, it was in the 80s. It was a long time. You were in the Assembly then,"" Kyrillos said, adding that ""you look at things in the context of their times. You look at the legislation as it’s proposed.""

Let’s refresh Kyrillos’ memory here, because PolitiFact New Jersey didn’t have to go back to the 1980s to find a time when he voted against increasing the minimum wage.

Kyrillos, a state senator from Monmouth County, voted against a 2005 proposal that boosted the minimum wage in two steps, eventually increasing it to $7.15 per hour in 2006.

That rate didn’t change until 2009, when the federal minimum wage jumped to $7.25 per hour. When federal and state minimum wages conflict, the higher one applies, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

When we pointed out the 2005 vote to Kyrillos spokeswoman Meaghan Cronin she said Kyrillos ""has supported increasing the minimum wage"" and cited another 2005 bill that he sponsored.

Two weeks after Kyrillos voted against the proposal that became law he introduced legislation that increased the minimum wage more, but at a slower pace. Under his bill, the minimum wage would increase in four stages, reaching $7.25 per hour on Aug. 1, 2008.

That bill was referred to committee but never came to a vote.

Still, Kyrillos is wrong to claim his vote against the minimum wage happened more than two decades ago, because he voted against it again less than 10 years ago.

In fact, Kyrillos wasn’t even in office for much of the 1980s. He joined the Assembly in 1988 before winning a seat in the state Senate, where he has served since 1992.

Then-assemblyman Kyrillos voted against a 1990 bill that hiked the minimum wage -- then set at $3.35 per hour -- in three phases, ultimately increasing it to an hourly rate of $5.05 in 1992.

Menendez, who also served in the assembly at the time, voted in favor of the bill, according to assembly minutes.

The assembly later voted again on the same measure after the senate amended the bill. On that second vote, Menendez again voted yes, while Kyrillos is not listed in the minutes as voting.

By 1992 both Kyrillos and Menendez had joined the state senate. That year a bill was introduced to delay half of the final increase in the minimum wage hike approved two years earlier.

Kyrillos voted in favor of that legislation, while Menendez opposed it. The governor vetoed the bill.

Our ruling

Kyrillos said, ""when I voted against [an increase in the minimum wage], it was in the 80s.""

Actually the state senator and Republican U.S. Senate hopeful voted against a bill in 2005 that eventually increased the minimum wage to $7.15 per hour.

We rate this statement False.

"['Georgia', 'Social Security', 'Senior Citizens League']","
Group claims Mexicans, not Americans, protected from Social Security cuts
","
Despite the time of year or political season, the topic of Social Security is always at the forefront of discussion, specifically among seniors tracking the status of the program and of their benefits.

In 2021, interest from investments will stop covering the cost of the program, which provides benefits for 55 million people. The fund is projected to run out of money by 2033 – three years earlier than predicted last year, according to the federal Social Security Administration’s 2012 report. Various options have been bandied about in Washington to keep the program afloat longer, including cutting benefits and removing income tax caps to funnel more money into the system.

The Senior Citizens League, an Alexandria, Va.-based, nonprofit advocacy group for seniors on issues including Social Security, Medicare and veteran and military retiree benefits, seized on the Social Security debate in a September mailer to members. A reader sent PolitiFact the mailer and asked us to examine the claims made by the organization.

TSCL’s latest mailer warned about international Social Security agreements, called totalization agreements, that coordinate the U.S. Social Security program with comparable programs of other countries. The totalization agreements prevent workers in one country from paying dual national retirement system taxes when working in another country, and the pacts also help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the United States and another country.

The U.S. has these types of agreements with about two dozen countries. A pending agreement with Mexico was signed in 2004 but has not yet been adopted[this is repeated later]. TSCL says it retained a law firm to study the U.S./Mexico agreement and, ""They believe if the Agreement goes into effect, the millions of Mexican citizens who will become eligible for Social Security benefits may have a far stronger claim to benefits and protection against cuts than U.S. citizens!"" as reported in the mailer.

TSCL has 1.3 million members/supporters, according to its website. The organization has been criticized in the past for its ""scare tactics"" aimed at seniors and about issues involving Social Security and health care, and for seeking donations from its members in misleading solicitations.

We asked Shannon Benton, TSCL’s executive director, about the Social Security letter and the research done on the totalization issue. Benton says the group has worked on the issue for years, including sending out various mailers about the Mexican agreement in the past.

TSCL hired Virginia law firm William J. Olson, P.C. to do the work over the years. The firm  handles constitutional law and has done work on behalf of other organizations including Gun Owners of America and the Conservative Legal Defense and Education Fund. It has filed eight Freedom of Information Act requests between the Social Security Administration and the State Department and filed a lawsuit to obtain a copy of the agreement in December 2006, attorney Bill Olson told us in an email.

One of TSCL’s main concerns with the Mexican agreement has been whether millions of  immigrants who have worked in this country illegally would become eligible for U.S. Social Security benefits, along with their dependents, and hurt the program’s trust funds, Olson wrote.

Previous PolitiFact checks found that there were no plans in Congress to allow illegal immigrants to collect Social Security benefits, even though many pay in the system. They could receive benefits only when and if they became legal.

But would Mexican citizens working in the country legally have greater protection from future cuts than U.S. citizens?

To break down the issue, we started at the beginning. The totalization agreement with Mexico has not yet been adopted by both countries, and there are no ongoing negotiations, according to a spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration.

We asked the administration for the number of workers who would be covered by the agreement with Mexico, but received no response. Barbara Neuby, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University who has been researching world pension changes, estimated the possible number of Mexicans covered under this agreement at around 1 million.

Those are ""people who have paid into this [Social Security] system, those who are here [in the United States] legally,"" Neuby said.

Social Security benefits are not a contractual right and can be changed by Congress, a 1960 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Fleming v. Nestor, established. But the TSCL claim that the totalization agreement would give Mexican citizens stronger claims to benefits and protections against cuts doesn’t hold up, according to experts on the issue.

The agreement is based on U.S. law, and that covers every beneficiary, Neuby said. For citizens of Mexico to be treated differently than U.S. citizens, Congress would have to create an exclusion for them, she said, a move that would be ""political suicide.""

""If Congress cut the U.S. benefits and not the Mexican citizens’ benefits, the people in Congress would be chased and would probably be shot,"" Neuby said, adding that such a move would be ""political suicide"" for Congress members.

Added Gary Burtless, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution: It’s hard to see how the description of totalization agreements ""can be squared with the idea that foreign citizens who receive Social Security would be exempt from a legislated cut in Social Security benefits that applies to U.S. citizens.""

While it is true that Congress can cut Social Security benefits, the claim that the pending totalization agreement would better protect Mexican citizens from benefits cuts is not accurate. The pending agreement has not been approved by the United States or Mexico, but to exclude some citizens from any cuts would require an exemption by Congress that is highly unlikely.

We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEC4E40>],/factchecks/2012/oct/15/senior-citizens-league/group-claims-mexicans-not-americans-protected-soci/
"['Families', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Tim Kaine']","
Tim Kaine says tax burden on families was lower during his governorship than George Allen's
","
The debate never strays too far from taxes in this fall’s U.S. Senate race between Republican George Allen and Democrat Tim Kaine.

Allen recently aired a TV commercial accusing Kaine of being a big taxer. The ad highlighted Kaine’s unsuccessful proposals for $4 billion in tax increases when he was governor from 2006 to 2010 and his comment in a Sept. 20 debate that he would be ""open"" to imposing a minimum federal income tax on all Americans.

Kaine responded to the ad. ""The facts are that the tax burden on Virginia families was lower under Tim Kaine than under George Allen,"" his campaign said in a Sept. 25 news release.

We wondered if the tax burden on families really was lower under Kaine than under Allen, who was governor from 1994 to 1998.

Kaine’s campaign told us they got the numbers from the pro-business Tax Foundation. The organization estimates what residents of each state pay in taxes -- not to just their own state and local governments, but also to others, through hotel, gas and other levies. Take, for example, Northern Virginia residents who work in the Washington. The computations would include state and local taxes the commuters are paying Virginia as well as estimates of sales, restaurant and other levies they pay in Washington.

According to the Tax Foundation, Virginians paid state and local taxes averaging 6.9 percent of their income during Allen’s governorship as compared to 6.7 percent during Kaine’s administration.

We were uncertain what to make of these numbers because neither Kaine nor Allen could control tax rates outside of Virginia when they were governors. So we turned to data that is confined to computing the state levies Virginians pay, as a proportion of their income, to Virginia.

We found two sources: Congressional Quarterly’s annual State Fact Finder; which makes the calculation based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis; and the Tax Policy Center, whose website allows visitors to build their own tables based on data from the Census Bureau.

The annual data from both groups computes total state tax revenues as a percentage of the total income of Virginians.

Congressional Quarterly’s figures show that during Allen’s governorship, yearly state tax revenues averaged 5.6 percent of all the income earned by Virginians; over Kaine’s term, the average was 5.3 percent.

The Tax Policy Center’s figures show that the average was an identical 5.3 percent during Allen and Kaine’s terms. It should be noted that the center did not have data for the final budget year of Kaine’s term, which began July 1, 2009.

We found an interesting trend in the data from both organizations. The tax burden was stable during the years Allen was in office; ranging from 5.5 percent to 5.6 percent according to the Congressional Quarterly, and 5.2 percent to 5.4 percent according to the Tax Policy Center.

In contrast, the burden was volatile under Kaine, falling from 5.9 percent during his first year in office to 4.6 percent his final year, according to Congressional Quarterly. According to the Tax Policy Center, the burden dropped from 5.6 percent Kaine’s first year to 4.8 percent his third year -- the latest data available.

Economists said the decline, experienced by many states, was caused by the national recession that set in half way through Kaine’s term. ""Tax collections shrink faster than income,"" explained said Scott Drenkard, an economist with the Tax Foundation.

Norton Francis, senior research associate with the Tax Policy Center, said Virginia’s tax revenues declined by 10 percent, as corporate income dropped, real estate sales sagged and consumers reined in spending.

Virginia did not enact major tax cuts during the final years of Kaine’s term. That leaves the recession as best explanation why the tax burden fell, according to Drenkard.

John Knapp, a senior economist and professor emeritus at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, said the per capita tax burden is a poor way to measure a governor’s performance.

""Many of the events during a term that affect the denominator (income) are beyond the control of a governor,"" he said. ""This also applies to the numerator (taxes) since a lot of factors affect tax collections in addition to explicit changes in tax rates and tax bases. For example, if the economy deteriorates in response to national and international events, income and sales tax collections will reflect the soft economy.""

The figures don’t reflect another important consideration: Allen unsuccessfully sought to cut taxes by $2.1 billion when he was governor, while Kaine unsuccessfully proposed $4 billion in tax increases.

Finally, we should note that under Allen and Kaine, Virginia was among the 10 states with the lowest tax per capita tax burdens.

Our ruling

Kaine’s campaign said the ""tax burden on Virginia families was lower under Tim Kaine than under George Allen.""

Raw numbers generally back Kaine, but paint a superficial picture. Kaine did not offer large-scale tax cuts during his term; to the contrary, he unsuccessfully proposed increasing taxes by $4 billion. The smaller burden was caused by shrinking tax revenues coming into the state because of the recession.

Kaine’s statement tries to turn the state’s lost revenue -- caused by no effort of his own -- into an accomplishment. The claim is based on kernels of data that, when put into context, give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB21C80>],/factchecks/2012/oct/15/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-says-tax-burden-families-was-lower-/
"['Ohio', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Ohio Republican Party']","
Ohio Republican Party says Obama has hurt Medicare, creating an unaccountable panel with the power to deny coverage
","
The Affordable Care Act, the health care reform law known commonly as Obamacare, remains a hot button subject in political campaigns. 
Not surprisingly, many claims made about the law in the 2010 campaign season are circulating again. Several appear in a brochure the Ohio Republican Party sent to voters in support of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.

The brochure is aimed specifically at seniors. It says they can count on Romney, but not on President Obama, who ""has worked to change Medicare for the worse.""

One of the ways Obama has done that, the mailing says, is by ""creating an unelected, unaccountable panel with the power to deny coverage of certain treatments.""

That statement echoed several similar claims PolitiFact has checked about the health care law and the unelected Independent Payments Advisory Board, or IPAB for short.

For this fact-check, we will borrow from our previous items to explain the board and the brochure's claim. Some of our information comes from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that studies health care, which put out a primer in 2010 about the board and a longer paper in 2011.

Just what is IPAB? 
The board was created by the 2010 health care law in response to criticism that Congress has been unwilling or unable to slow the increasing costs of Medicare, the federal program that pays for seniors’ health care.

Under the health care reform law, if Medicare spending growth is projected to exceed pre-set targets, the IPAB must come up with plans to slow that increase. If Congress does not act on the recommendations within a set time, IPAB’s recommendations automatically go into effect. (For a more detailed explanation of how this would work, we recommend this April 2011 report from the independent Kaiser Family Foundation.)

The IPAB can reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of readmissions, or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some argue that because the IPAB can reduce what the government pays health care providers, its decisions could ultimately impact what services are available to patients.

But IPAB recommendations themselves would not apply to any particular individual.

Rather, they would be across-the-board policy recommendations applied to the entire program. Given the claim's wording that IPAB could ""deny coverage of certain treatments,"" some readers could get the wrong impression that the board would review individual patient treatments and deny care. That’s not the case.

Still, the IPAB has become one of the more contentious points of the health care law; even some members of Congress who voted for the overall health care law don’t like the IPAB. Congress held hearings earlier this year on repealing the board.

The hearings were organized by opponents of the IPAB, but people who testified raised concerns that IPAB’s powers are so limited that its only real recourse is to reduce payments for doctors and other health care providers, which could end up putting pressure on patient care.

We should note that these concerns are also present under the current system, in which Congress takes a more active role. 
Limits on its powers 
There are restrictions on what IPAB can recommend in the name of cost savings. It cannot raise rates, reduce benefits, drop beneficiaries or ration care. Here’s the exact language from the law itself:

""The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums under section 1818, 1818A, or 1839, increase Medicare beneficiary cost-sharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria.""

The brochure calls the IPAB an ""unelected, unaccountable panel."" Its 15 full-time members aren’t elected. But that doesn’t mean they’re unaccountable.

• They’re appointed by the president and approved by the Senate.

• They can’t serve more than two six-year terms.

• Their recommendations can be rejected by Congress.

• They must follow disclosure and ethics guidelines, and they can’t perform other jobs as they serve.

• They can be removed by the president for ""neglect of duty"" or ""malfeasance in office,"" though not for any other reason.

In addition to limiting the reasons a board member might be removed, lawmakers sought to insulate the board’s decisions from special-interest lobbying:

Its recommendations are fast-tracked in Congress and go into effect automatically if lawmakers fail to act. Implementation of its recommendations isn’t subject to administrative or judicial review.

So while their decisions are protected by law, board members are to some degree accountable. In particular, they could fail to win a second term, or get fired by the president.

The mailing by the Ohio Republican Party said ""President Obama is weakening Medicare as we know it"" by ""creating an unelected, unaccountable panel with the power to deny coverage of certain treatments."" 
Truth-O-Meter rating 
There’s an small element of truth in the claim. Board members aren’t elected. And the board will make decisions that arguably could impact the availability of services.

But it’s a stretch to say the members of the board are entirely unaccountable. They’re appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. The president can fire them for neglect of duty or malfeasance.They’re required to recommend cuts to Medicare in years that other cost-saving measures don’t meet growth targets — but Congress can overrule their recommendations.

And describing the board as having ""the power to deny coverage of certain treatments"" could lead readers to believe the board will sit around a table and talk about individual cases, like whether grandpa can get his bypass or not, and that’s not the case. The board won’t look at individual patients or deny individual treatments. Instead, it will make system-wide recommendations to rein in the future growth of Medicare spending, and it makes those recommendations within limited parameters.

Those are critical facts that would give a different impression.

Blackburn letter claims Consumer commission stopping Buckyballs sales “without consultation or input from the company”
","
Buckyballs and Buckycubes, tiny rare earth magnets manufactured in China and sold by the Maxfield & Oberton Co. of New York, are intended to be adult desk toys. They’re marketed as ""the amazing magnetic desk toys you can’t put down,"" and have received rave reviews in magazines like Maxim, Wired, Esquire and People.

They’ve also been swallowed by children and have been the cause of emergency surgeries.

In July, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, in filing only its second administrative complaint in 11 years, charged that their design poses a ""substantial risk of injury to the public.""

U.S. Reps. Marsha Blackburn and Phil Roe, both R-Tenn., and five other members of Congress, wrote to President Obama on Oct. 1, saying the CPSC ""is penalizing our nation’s brightest innovators and job creators through excessive and selective enforcement.""

The congressmen go on to say that they learned of the Buckyballs case during a recent hearing. They say CPSC ""overreach and lack of flexibility has virtually eliminated these products and the jobs associated with their sales and distribution."" They ask the president to review the case and for the CPSC to continue to work cooperatively with the company.

They point out that 2.5 million of the small magnetic cube and ball toys have been sold in the past three years. Then they say that the ""CPSC is working, without consultation or input from the company, to eliminate this product by stopping the sale of their products by directly approaching its retail partners and requesting a recall.""

We asked Blackburn’s communications director, Mike Reynard, for supporting evidence that the agency was acting without consultation or input from the company. After conferring with staffers, Reynard sent a USA Today story indicating the CPSC has been intervening with retailers to end sales of the magnets as it pursues its lawsuit. He said the lawsuit itself showed the agency is ""done working with the company.""

In a followup email message, Reynard wrote: ""You can't say you're working with someone when you are actively suing them to kill their product. That might be the administration's idea of a cooperative working relationship but it isn't for most Americans and business owners. CPSC should be working with Buckyballs to resolve any concerns around these limited cases when compared to the 2.5 million units sold. Clearly they have pushed to get this product off shelves as the USA Today story confirms specific vendors who have pulled the product.""

Roe spokeswoman Tiffany McGuffee said Roe takes the same position.   

Then we looked at the lengthy letter from Maxfield & Oberton CEO Craig Zucker laying out its case against the CPSC’s actions. It notes the ""extraordinary lengths"" the company has taken to prevent misuse of its products, including ""warnings, education, labeling, retailer sales restrictions and continuous cooperation with the CPSC – right up until literally the moment they turned on us.""

Zucker’s letter explains the toys went on sale in March 2009 and were originally labeled for use by those 13 and older. When the federal rules for children’s games changed to include those 14 and older, the company entered into a May 2010 voluntary recall of all the toys with the original labeling. It went on to create a ""comprehensive safety program"" and began labeling the toys with a warning: ""Keep Away From All Children.""

The company also required retailers to agree to rules for placement of its products in their stores, with new signs. It designed a ""Magnet Safety"" website in March and met with three CPSC commissioners and staff in April to discuss the expanded safety program. The company also created a medical advisory group and, along with its competitors, created the Coalition for Magnet Safety.

But on July 10, the commission voted 3-1 to file the administrative complaint after, it said, ""discussions with the company and its representatives failed to result in a voluntary recall plan that CPSC considered to be adequate."" The CPSC said that, despite the warnings and labeling, people were still ingesting the magnets, sometimes after placing them on tongues or on cheeks to resemble piercings.

The CPSC warned that when two magnets are swallowed, they can be attracted to each other through stomach or intestinal walls, resulting in serious injury requiring surgery. CPSC spokesman Scott Wolfson said in an interview that gastroenterologists have said the injuries often resemble ""a gunshot to the gut"" but without entrance or exit wounds. Wolfson noted that both Maxfield & Oberton and a Denver-based company, Zen Magnets, were sued after they failed to provide adequate suggestions for making their products safer. They were the first such complaints since the Arkansas-based Daisy BB gun company was sued in 2001.

""Due to the number of ingestion incidents received by CPSC staff since the 2010 recall announcement and 2011 safety alert, CPSC staff seeks the remedies outlined in the complaint to stop further incidents and injuries to children,"" the agency said in a statement. Those remedies include stopping the sale of the toys and providing consumers with refunds.

Blackburn, Roe and their fellow letter writers are concerned that the ""nation’s brightest innovators and job creators"" are being penalized by an overzealous consumer protection agency. We’ll leave it to others to determine whether the sellers of Chinese magnetic balls qualify as the nation’s ""brightest innovators,"" and will also decline to determine the truth of the letter writers’ assertion that the agency’s first administrative complaint in 11 years suggest ""excessive and selective enforcement.""

Roe letter claims Consumer commission stopping Buckyballs sales “without consultation or input from the company”
","
Buckyballs and Buckycubes, tiny rare earth magnets manufactured in China and sold by the Maxfield & Oberton Co. of New York, are intended to be adult desk toys. They’re marketed as ""the amazing magnetic desk toys you can’t put down,"" and have received rave reviews in magazines like Maxim, Wired, Esquire and People.

They’ve also been swallowed by children and have been the cause of emergency surgeries.

In July, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, in filing only its second administrative complaint in 11 years, charged that their design poses a ""substantial risk of injury to the public.""

U.S. Reps. Marsha Blackburn and Phil Roe, both R-Tenn., and five other members of Congress, wrote to President Obama on Oct. 1, saying the CPSC ""is penalizing our nation’s brightest innovators and job creators through excessive and selective enforcement.""

The congressmen go on to say that they learned of the Buckyballs case during a recent hearing. They say CPSC ""overreach and lack of flexibility has virtually eliminated these products and the jobs associated with their sales and distribution."" They ask the president to review the case and for the CPSC to continue to work cooperatively with the company.

They point out that 2.5 million of the small magnetic cube and ball toys have been sold in the past three years. Then they say that the ""CPSC is working, without consultation or input from the company, to eliminate this product by stopping the sale of their products by directly approaching its retail partners and requesting a recall.""

We asked Blackburn’s communications director, Mike Reynard, for supporting evidence that the agency was acting without consultation or input from the company. After conferring with staffers, Reynard sent a USA Today story indicating the CPSC has been intervening with retailers to end sales of the magnets as it pursues its lawsuit. He said the lawsuit itself showed the agency is ""done working with the company.""

In a followup email message, Reynard wrote: ""You can't say you're working with someone when you are actively suing them to kill their product. That might be the administration's idea of a cooperative working relationship but it isn't for most Americans and business owners. CPSC should be working with Buckyballs to resolve any concerns around these limited cases when compared to the 2.5 million units sold. Clearly they have pushed to get this product off shelves as the USA Today story confirms specific vendors who have pulled the product.""

Roe spokeswoman Tiffany McGuffee said Roe takes the same position.   

Then we looked at the lengthy letter from Maxfield & Oberton CEO Craig Zucker laying out its case against the CPSC’s actions. It notes the ""extraordinary lengths"" the company has taken to prevent misuse of its products, including ""warnings, education, labeling, retailer sales restrictions and continuous cooperation with the CPSC – right up until literally the moment they turned on us.""

Zucker’s letter explains the toys went on sale in March 2009 and were originally labeled for use by those 13 and older. When the federal rules for children’s games changed to include those 14 and older, the company entered into a May 2010 voluntary recall of all the toys with the original labeling. It went on to create a ""comprehensive safety program"" and began labeling the toys with a warning: ""Keep Away From All Children.""

The company also required retailers to agree to rules for placement of its products in their stores, with new signs. It designed a Magnet Safety website in March of this year and met with three CPSC commissioners and staff in April to discuss the expanded safety program. The company also created a medical advisory group and, along with its competitors, created the Coalition for Magnet Safety.

But on July 10, the commission voted 3-1 to file the administrative complaint after, it said, ""discussions with the company and its representatives failed to result in a voluntary recall plan that CPSC considered to be adequate."" The CPSC said that, despite the warnings and labeling, people were still ingesting the magnets, sometimes after placing them on tongues or on cheeks to resemble piercings.

Brendan Doherty says U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, when he was a state representative, opposed mandatory sentences for people convicted of domestic violence and child abuse
","
Republican Brendan Doherty, the former superintendent of the state police, has been mining incumbent U.S. Rep. David Cicilline’s past votes in the state legislature and his work as a criminal defense lawyer to portray the Democrat as someone unwilling to stand up for the victimized.

One of those charges, made in an Oct. 9 news release, was that, as a state representative in the 1990s, Cicilline was against mandatory sentences for those convicted of domestic violence and child abuse.  

The charge was part of a flurry of political counterpunches Doherty unloaded against Cicilline after the Democratic incumbent linked Republican Doherty to what the Democrats are saying is the Republican Party’s ""war on women.""

Doherty’s campaign claimed it was hypocritical for Cicilline to make such a charge when he cast votes as a state representative that indicated a lack of support for victims of domestic violence or child abuse.

The Doherty campaign backed up the charge with citations. In 1995, as a state representative from Providence, Cicilline was one of seven House members to vote against a bill that set mandatory minimum sentences for those who were convicted of domestic violence a second time.

In 1996, they said Cicilline also voted against a law that established a 10-year minimum sentence for first-degree child abuse of a child under six. Those sentenced also had to serve at least eight and a half  years before being eligible for parole.

We checked the official record and confirmed that Cicilline voted against both bills.

The 1995 law on domestic violence set a 10-day minimum sentence for a second conviction of misdemeanor domestic assault. The mandatory minimum went up to a year for a third conviction.

It also required anyone sentenced under the law to pay a $25 fee to a state fund that paid for state programs on domestic violence training. It also obligated those sentenced to seek counseling.  

The bill passed the House 83-7 and was signed into law.

The second vote came on a bill that had become known as Brendan’s Law. It was proposed in response to the public outrage over the case of six-week old Brendan Cunha,  who was left blind, deaf and brain-damaged after a brutal beating by his father, Michael Bertrand, in 1993.

Bertrand was given a 10-year prison sentence and 10 years of probation, which meant he was eligible for parole after two years.  In 1998, however, the Parole Board not only denied his request, it voted never to consider a request from him again and ordered he serve the full 10 years.

During the 1996 debate on the bill, Cicilline proposed an amendment that would have allowed a judge to consider an alternative to the 10-year minimum if the judge found ""that substantial and compelling circumstances exist"" to justify such an action.

The amendment failed on a 60-18 vote and the final bill passed, 77-6, with Cicilline in the minority.

Cicilline campaign spokesman Eric Hyers said Cicilline’s votes were based on his longstanding belief that judges in the courtroom, who have heard the evidence and arguments in a case, are more qualified to determine appropriate sentences.

""He strongly believes that judges, not politicians, not elected officials -- should be making sentencing decisions,"" Hyers said.

Our ruling 

Brendan Doherty’s campaign said David Cicilline voted against a 1995 bill that imposed harsher sentences on those convicted a second time of domestic violence and a 1996 bill that did the same for convicted child abusers.  

The legislative record shows Cicilline did vote against both bills. We rule Doherty’s statement True.

After votes against major Iran sanction bills, Baldwin has voted in favor
","
Campaigning for U.S. Senate, Republican Tommy Thompson points to Democrat Tammy Baldwin’s votes opposing economic sanctions on Iran as evidence of what he calls his rival’s ""record of radical policy.""

So when Baldwin said in the first debate that she had voted for ""tough and biting sanctions against Iran,"" Thompson pounced.

""My opponent just, I think, misstated,"" Thompson said during the Sept. 28, 2012 debate. ""She voted against the sanctions in 2006, 2009 and 2010, then in August (2012) she voted for them because she was running for the United States Senate. Complete change of heart.""

Cue the Flip-O-Meter.

That’s what we use to determine if a candidate has changed position on an issue. An important note: We’re not rating the political or policy merits of any switch. We’re looking at whether the candidate has been consistent.

So, did Baldwin get tough on Iran as the election neared and -- if so -- was it a change in her longstanding view?

While Thompson went back to 2006, we studied dozens of Baldwin’s votes dating to 1999, her first year in Congress. Based on that review and consultations with foreign-policy analysts, we focused on the major sanctions votes -- five before Baldwin’s Senate candidacy, and two after she started running.

Here’s a chronology of key actions:

July 26, 2001: Baldwin joined a 409-6 House majority in approving a five-year extension of the Clinton-era Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996. That law, passed unanimously, had sought to discourage foreign energy firms from investing in those nations. The George W. Bush administration had sought a shorter extension, trying to aid diplomatic efforts.

April 26, 2006: With the sanctions due to expire and concerns about Iran’s nuclear program rising, Baldwin voted against extending and toughening sanctions. The vote on the Iran Freedom Support Act was 397-21.

Baldwin initially joined 359 others in co-sponsoring the bill, but said the final version was too heavy handed in targeting the oil and gas industries in Iran. Baldwin, a critic of the Bush administration’s Iraq war, said the law would ""give cover for a military attack by this administration.""

December 15, 2009: In President Barack Obama’s first year, Baldwin joined a very small minority of lawmakers in voting against what was introduced as the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act of 2009. It passed the House 412-12.

Baldwin said it went too far and would punish ordinary, pro-democracy Iranians by imposing sanctions against companies that supply Iran with gasoline.

June 24, 2010: Baldwin voted against a beefed-up version of the 2009 bill, relabeled as the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010. The vote to approve was 408-8.

A key supporter, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, called it the ""strongest Iran sanctions legislation ever passed by the Congress"" and necessary because ""in the last year, Iran has concealed major nuclear facilities...and openly threatened to, as the Iranian president said, ‘wipe Israel off the face of the map.’''

May 26, 2011: Baldwin joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers opposing a defense funding bill that contained a major new sanctions tactic. Baldwin’s campaign says she voted against it because of her very public opposition to continued funding for the war in Afghanistan.

The bill, approved 322-96, contained a provision that sought to disrupt the Iranian financial system by dissuading foreign banks from dealing with the Iranian central bank. The particulars of that move -- which the Wall Street Journal said marked ""the sharpest economic confrontation between Washington and Tehran yet"" -- had drawn some opposition from the Obama administration.

December 14, 2011: Three months after entering the U.S. Senate race, Baldwin supported a major bill that sought to expand sanctions.

The legislation, which passed as the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, sought a far-reaching expansion of the 1996 sanctions act. A New York Times account said the bill’s measures ""target Iran’s oil and petrochemical sectors as well as its shipping trade, (and) intensify existing sanctions intended to choke off the revenue that Iran reaps from its two largest export industries.""

Baldwin was in the majority on the 410-11 vote. Among those in opposition: U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, the Ohio Democrat whom Baldwin had joined in opposing previous sanction expansions.

""Proponents of the Iran Threat Reduction Act claim that it's a last-ditch effort to prevent military confrontation with Iran,"" The Hill quoted Kucinich as saying. ""Yet, this bill takes away the most effective tool to prevent war, diplomacy.""

 August 2012: On final passage of the Threat Reduction Act, Baldwin again voted yes on a 421-6 vote. This is the vote Thompson cited. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) blasted the bill as ""just one more step to another war that we don't need.""

We could find no public comments by Baldwin as to her reasoning on the 2012 vote. Her campaign declined to comment on it.

Additional factors

In our research, though, we found that Baldwin’s congressional webpage struck a tougher tone on Iran in 2012 when compared to before her entry into the Senate race.

A month before she entered the race, her page said Iran was subject to sanctions in part due to its ""purported support"" for terror activities.

It now says: ""No country poses a greater threat to Middle East peace and stability than Iran. Iran is a major state sponsor of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, which exercises significant control over the government of Lebanon, and Hamas, which operates in the Gaza strip.""

We consulted four officials about the legislative history:

Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a sanctions expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics; Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the pro-sanctions Foundation for Defense of Democracies; Jamal Abdi, policy director at the National Iranian American Council, an advocacy group that opposes broad sanctions that hurt ordinary Iranians; and Matthew Irvine, a defense researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a non-profit think tank.

All four said the bills from 2001 through 2012 built on the original 1996 sanctions and raised similar issues for supporters and opponents.

""I don’t see the ‘pivot point’ for objecting to earlier sanctions and endorsing the Threat Reduction Act (in 2012), nor do I see grounds for supporting the 2001 Act and then opposing the 2006 Act,"" Hufbauer wrote in an email.

Dubowitz agreed, saying: ""There’s no way to reconcile 2006, 2010 and 2012 votes from a policy perspective.""

Elected officials who are concerned about the humanitarian impact of sanctions might have been expected to stand against the 2012 measure, Dubowitz said.

Abdi noted, though, that the dynamic was somewhat different in 2012. As the temperature rose over possible Israeli military action against Iran, tougher sanctions became a more attractive alternative for some. Irvine agreed, saying the security environment had worsened.

He added that the Democratic caucus aggressively ""whipped"" the 2012 bill, trying to get everyone on board for the election-year vote.

As for the 2001 bill Baldwin voted for, Dubowitz said it would have been surprising if she had opposed it given that it extended the 1996 act approved under a Democrat, President Bill Clinton.

We found only other House member who voted as she did on the 2001, 2006, 2009-10 and 2012 votes: Arizona Republican Jeff Flake.

Flake, like Baldwin, is seeking a U.S. Senate seat in November 2012. He’s been ripped as a flip-flopper over his sanction votes.

John Kraus, Baldwin’s campaign spokesperson, took issue with Thompson’s claim of a ""change of heart"" by Baldwin. He said Baldwin has a lengthy record of supporting sanctions and has taken a tough stance against Iran.

He sent a list of votes showing Baldwin has voted for numerous bills expressing condemnation of Iranian human rights abuses and deception regarding its nuclear programs, or expressing concern over Iran’s potential nuclear capabilities. But the question at hand is Baldwin’s position on sanctions.

Kraus also pointed to several votes, long before she got into the Senate race, in which Baldwin supported sanctions, including measures that died in the Senate in 2007 and 2009. We confirmed those votes.

The most significant bill she backed was the 2009 Iran Sanctions Enabling Act, which sought to pressure local pension funds to divest from companies invested in Iran’s energy sector. Hufbauer called the Enabling Act ""largely symbolic,"" while Abdi and Dubowitz said it was a significant bill though not on the level of the 2006 and 2010 actions.

Whatever the merits, that divestment bill was rolled into the tougher and broader 2010 sanctions bill -- and Baldwin, as we noted, opposed that 2010 legislation.

Our rating

Overall, Baldwin can point to support of a framework of sanctions and of some specific upgrades, but on the major bills, she consistently stood against expansion. From 2006 to 2011, she voted against the four biggest moves to toughen sanctions against Iran.

After she entered the race, and in one case just three months from the November 2012 election, Baldwin was confronted with another major sanctions vote, on the Threat Reduction Act.

All of our experts, whose views on sanctions vary, agreed that it was inconsistent to vote in favor of tougher sanctions in 2012, and was not a logical policy evolution based on the specifics of the bill.

Was it based on the changing political landscape, the heightening of tensions, the electoral calculus of the Senate race? All of the above? Something else?

Whatever the reasons, this amounted to a major reversal of position.

That’s a Full Flop on our meter.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC73F540>],/factchecks/2012/oct/14/tammy-baldwin/after-votes-against-major-Iran-sanction-bills/
"['New Jersey', 'Federal Budget', 'Robert Menendez']","
U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez says the Budget Control Act is the federal budget
","
When it comes to passing a budget, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez hasn’t been doing his job, according to his Republican challenger, state Sen. Joe Kyrillos.

In a heated debate Wednesday on New Jersey 101.5-FM, the Democratic incumbent and Kyrillos argued over whether the U.S. Senate has passed a budget in the last three years. The two candidates will face off in the Nov. 6 general election.

""The Senate hasn’t passed a budget in three years,"" said Kyrillos, who represents part of Monmouth County. ""That’s just a fact, hasn’t done it.""

But Menendez said that wasn’t true: ""Secondly, there is a budget. It’s called the Budget Control Act and you should look it up. You’d understand then that your statement about not having a budget for the last three years would be wrong.""

So, is Menendez right that Kyrillos’ statement is inaccurate and the Senate has passed a budget ""called the Budget Control Act""?

That legislation performs budgetary functions -- such as setting limits on certain types of future discretionary spending -- but the Act is not a budget plan under the official congressional budget process. 
That kind of plan is called a ""budget resolution"" and the Senate hasn’t passed one in more than three years.

William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said in an e-mail that ""a completed budget is expected to do much more than set spending levels for discretionary programs.""

Galston added, ""The 2011 BCA kept the government open, but it didn’t constitute a full budget.""
   
Let’s explain what a budget resolution is.

The House and Senate are supposed to adopt a budget resolution that covers the upcoming fiscal year and at least the following four fiscal years.

A budget resolution does not become law, but instead serves as the framework for appropriations bills and other subsequent legislation dealing with budgetary matters.

With Menendez voting yes, the Senate last passed a budget resolution on April 29, 2009 for fiscal year 2010. In the absence of a budget resolution, Congress has taken other steps to spend money and set certain budgetary guidelines.

Now, let’s turn to the Budget Control Act.

Enacted in August 2011, that legislation also included provisions to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, and set up a process that could trigger additional spending cuts. Menendez voted against the bill.

The Act is similar to a budget resolution in terms of setting those discretionary spending limits, according to Jason Peuquet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization focused on debt reduction.

But the legislation did not ""set forth projections for mandatory spending and targeted revenue levels for five years,"" which budget resolutions do, Peuquet told us.

Harvard Law School professor Howell Jackson added in an e-mail that ""I don’t think it’s fair to consider this a substitute for the actual adoption of a budget resolution, which has lots of other implications (and procedural vehicles for getting around the filibuster).""

In a statement, Mike Soliman, Menendez’s campaign manager, argued that Menendez didn’t say the Senate passed a budget resolution, but that it passed a budget.

""The Budget Control Act is stronger than a budget resolution because it actually has the force of law,"" Soliman added. ""The Budget Control Act carries the force of law, it sets our spending limits for two years, and it actually dictates our nation's spending. A non-binding budget resolution does not.""

Our ruling

During last week’s debate, Menendez claimed Kyrillos’ statement was wrong and that the Senate has passed ""a budget"" in the last three years, ""called the Budget Control Act.""

That Act set limits on discretionary spending, but it is missing other features of a ""budget resolution,"" which is considered a budget plan under the official congressional budget process. The Senate hasn’t passed such a plan in more than three years.

We rate the statement False.

Twin River-linked organization says approval of table games referendum in Rhode Island will ""save"" 900 jobs at gambling complex
","
Once again, the state's two slot parlors are rolling the dice in hopes that Rhode Islanders -- along with residents of Lincoln and Newport, where the facilities are located -- will approve referenda permitting the table games that will make them full-fledged casinos.

While recent polls show support for the measure, it's anything but a sure bet, and the businesses are spending millions to win support for the measure.

One commercial in support of Question 1 is sponsored by Coalition to Bring Jobs to R.I., a 501(c)4 nonprofit ""social welfare"" organization created by officials at Twin River, in Lincoln, the larger of the two facilities.

It features an East Providence woman who talks about the problems of the Rhode Island economy and tells viewers: ""By voting to approve, we can keep revenue right here, save 900 jobs and help create 650 new ones."" The ad makes no mention of the Newport facility, Newport Grand.

We were interested in checking whether defeat of Question 1 would really result in the loss of 900 existing jobs at Twin River.

(A comparable proposal, Question 2, would allow table games at Newport Grand.)

Twin River and Newport Grand want to add table games to remain competitive with the three casinos and one ""racino"" expected to be created in Massachusetts in the next several years.

The fear is that, without the table games, customers will flock to the Bay State instead. The stakes are huge for the Rhode Island state budget: the two businesses accounted for $321 million of revenue in the budget year that ended June 30, 2012 -- about 10 percent of all revenue.

So will 900 jobs be lost if Question 1 is rejected?

Only if Twin River shuts down completely.

It turns out that 900 is roughly the number of workers that Twin River says it employs now.

If the referendum is rejected, Twin River will continue operating.

In the short term, the first Massachusetts casino is not expected to open its doors for a few years.

And even with the Bay State casinos up and running, Twin River can be profitable, said Clyde Barrow,  director of the Center for Policy Analysis at UMass Dartmouth and an expert on gambling in the region.

The assumption in the ad is that if voters don't authorize table games Twin River will close, Barrow said. ""I don't think that's the case. It's true that once the slot parlor casinos are open in Massachusetts, they do stand to lose as much as 50 percent of their net terminal income,"" which was $463 million in 2011.

""Even if Twin River went to a $225-million-a-year operation, that's still a pretty substantial facility,"" said Barrow. ""It's larger than some of the casinos in Atlantic City. So it will definitely have the capacity to still be profitable at a smaller level of operation.""

""They would certainly have to lay some people off,"" said Barrow, ""But it wouldn't be the full 900.""

We also checked a report commissioned by Gov. Lincoln Chafee that included projections of employment at Twin River with and without table games under various scenarios.

In the worst-case scenario, where at least one Massachusetts casino is built near Rhode Island, Twin River would have 397 fewer jobs in 2017 than in 2011 if table games aren't permitted. With table games, the loss would be cut to 118 jobs.

But that's just the worst scenario.

The report says the likeliest outcome is that 319 jobs would be lost if table games were not allowed, and 201 jobs would be gained if Question 1 were to be passed.

Under any scenario, that's not close to 900 jobs.

When we contacted Twin River, spokeswoman Patti Doyle said that if there are no table games in Rhode Island, Twin River expects to lose 25 percent to 35 percent of its gambling revenue when Massachusetts casinos open. Twin River expects the competition to be on line by late 2016 or early 2017.

""A gaming revenue decline at Mohegan Sun and Atlantic City brought nearly a parallel reduction in work force,"" she said. ""So, it's safe to assume that a loss of revenue of 25 percent would translate into a 25 percent loss of our workforce.""

A 25 percent to 35 percent reduction would result in cuts of 225 to 315 jobs, not 900.

Nonetheless, Doyle says Twin River isn't suggesting that the gambling complex might have to close its doors.

""That's not what the ads are saying, nor are we saying that now,"" she wrote in an e-mail. ""We can say with certainty with table game approval, none of the existing 900 jobs will be lost.""

But that's not what the ad says, nor how most people will perceive it.

Our Ruling

The Coalition to Bring Jobs to R.I., an organization pushing for approval of a referendum question to permit table games at Twin River, says that passage would save 900 jobs in Rhode Island.

But the only way 900 jobs would be lost at Twin River would be if it closed, and nobody -- including Twin River -- is saying that's going to happen.

Even if Twin River had to scale back its operation by 25 percent to 35 percent, that's not close to the 900 positions that Jobs to R.I. says are at risk.

Because the company -- based on its own estimates -- is overplaying its hand, offering a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

"['Tennessee', 'Education', 'John G. Morgan']","
Official says students, not state, paying most of college cost
","
It’s well known that college tuition, at both public and private schools, has risen rapidly over the past several years. The steep increases have occurred across the nation, and Tennessee’s public institutions are no different,  largely as a result of declining state appropriations  

But when John Morgan, chancellor of the Tennessee Board of Regents, told a U.S. Senate committeethat Tennessee students now pay 67 percent of the costs of their educations at the state’s universities and 60 percent at community colleges, we were curious.  When many parents of today’s students were public college students themselves two, three or four decades ago, the ratio was the reverse: state appropriations comprised up to 70 percent of the costs, and students and their parents picked up the rest.  Did the burden shift that much?

In a word, yes. Morgan was precisely on mark with his testimony, as expected from a higher education administrator who spent 10 years as state comptroller, state  government’s chief auditor and financial watchdog.

The latest figures available from the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, for the 2011-12 school year, show that student tuition and fees comprised 67 percent of the sum of revenue that state universities receive from state appropriations and from tuition and fees, and 60 percent at the community colleges. TheTHEC Fact Bookfor 2011-12, which is full of interesting information about public higher education in Tennessee, is available for review onTHEC’s website.

It’s important to note that those figures do NOT include what students pay for meal plans, residence halls and books and supplies – expenses that are not subsidized by taxpayers and which can be triple the costs of tuition at public schools. When those costs are included, students and parents are paying far more than two-thirds of the total costs of attending public institutions. But Morgan was discussing only tuition and mandatory fees.

Students’ share of the costs has been steadily rising while the state’s share has been declining. Through the mid-1980s, the state paid about 70 percent of what its public colleges and universities cost on a per-student basis. But that share has been decreasing ever since, through both Democratic and Republican control of the state Capitol.

By 2000, the state share had declined to 57 percent at its universities and 68 percent at its community colleges. By the 2011-12 school year, the state share was down to about one-third at the universities and to 40 percent at the community colleges. The tipping point when Tennessee students began paying more of the costs than taxpayers occurred in 2003 at the four-year schools and in 2009 at the two-year campuses, THEC says.

When contacted for this article, Morgan said that ""even with the rise in tuition over the last five years or so, on a per full-time equivalent basis, our institutions have less money to spend than they did five or so years ago,"" at least through last year.  ""State reductions, along with a rise in enrollments, have forced us to become more efficient in a way,"" Morgan said.

He added:""Whatever the case, I believe we are at a point where we can’t raise tuition much beyond general-inflation increases without impacting enrollment.  We may already be seeing that effect this year: enrollment is down on average across our system although historically enrollments rise during recessions and flatten out or decline somewhat during recoveries. From a public policy standpoint, if Tennessee’s future is dependent on increasing education attainment, we are going to have to find a way to make it affordable. I’m hopeful that is a conversation we have as a state this year.""

Gov. Bill Haslam is focusing on higher education this year, although much of his work thus far has been on ensuring that public institutions produce graduates with skills to enter the state’s workforce. So far at least, about his only talk of affordability has been a promise to try to increase state funding and efficiencies on public campuses, which would reduce the pressures to raise tuition. It will be interesting to see how much influence Morgan, who has spent most of his career helping inform the public policy of the state, will have on that discussion.

Our ruling

Parents of aspiring college students who remember the days when tuition covered just one-third the per-student costs at state colleges and universities may be shocked to learn that, at least in Tennessee, students now pay 67 percent of the costs of their education through tuition and fees.

That’s the point that one of Tennessee’s top higher education officials told a Senate committee, and the research backs him up. We rule this statement True.
