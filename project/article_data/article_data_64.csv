Paul Sadler says Ted Cruz pledges to shut down Department of Education, which would shutter federal aid to college students
","
Paul Sadler, the Democratic nominee for a U.S. Senate seat from Texas, casts his Republican opponent, Ted Cruz, as stumping on extremist ideas.

And in a Sept. 26, 2012, press release, Sadler zeroed in on what he called Cruz’s desire to eliminate federal aid to college students. The release says Cruz has pledged to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education, ""which would result in the loss of many programs used by Texas students.""

In the release, Sadler says: ""The Department of Education includes federal student aid. If we eliminate it, then we truly make college education unaffordable for a large segment of our population in every single country, every single city, every single town.""

After asking Sadler spokeswoman Donna McDonald for the basis of Sadler’s claim, we looked for evidence of Cruz wanting to kill the agency, including its oversight of federal college student aid.

Cruz has often called for eliminating several agencies including the education department.

As noted in a May 6, 2012, Houston Chronicle news article, Cruz said at the Texas Capitol that day: ""We need to eliminate unnecessary and unconstitutional agencies like the Department of Education ... the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, the National Endowment of the Arts. ... I would most like to eliminate the Internal Revenue Service.""

Later, in an Aug. 5, 2012, interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News, Cruz did not object when Wallace said, ""You want to abolish (the) Education, Commerce and Energy departments"" as well as the Transportation Security Administration and IRS.

And in an interview posted Sept. 2, 2012, by the Daily Caller, a conservative-leaning news website, Cruz said: ""I think we should shrink the size and power of the federal government by every and any means possible. What does that mean? That means eliminating unnecessary or unconstitutional agencies. The first agency I would eliminate would be the U.S. Department of Education. I think education is far too important to be governed by unelected bureaucrats in Washington. I think it should be at the state level, or even better, at the local level where parents have direct influence over the education of our kids.""

So, Cruz wants to wipe out the department, which originated in 1867 but did not become a Cabinet-level agency until 1980.

And what does the agency do? It ""establishes policy for, administers and coordinates most federal assistance to education,"" according to information on a department website. In 2007-08, department expenditures affected approximately 55 million students (pre-K through grade 12) in some 100,000 public schools and 34,000 private schools, the agency says, while providing grant, loan and work-study assistance to about 10 million undergraduate students.

By telephone, Sadler told us Cruz’s saying he’d eliminate the department naturally means he would abandon all its functions -- including student aid.

Sadler also pointed out a Sept. 25, 2012, El Paso Times news article quoting Cruz as saying he favors shutting down the agency and others. But it also quotes Cruz as saying that vital department functions such as teacher training would be pulled into other agencies.

Minutes after we interviewed Sadler, he called us to point out a fresh news post by the Dallas Morning News on its Trailblazers blog. According to the Sept. 26, 2012, post, Cruz had just dismissed Sadler’s contention that eliminating the education department would jeopardize college student loan programs.

""Of course not,"" the News’ post quotes Cruz as saying. ""Student aid is critically important. … In my life, education opened doors for my parents and for me that never would’ve been opened.""

According to the post, Cruz said federal aid for college students should be wrested from the department and sent to the states as block grants. ""We should take the funding, give it to the states and put the states in the position to make the decisions how to have the greatest impact in their communities,"" Cruz said.

It would be unfair to consider information that came to light after Sadler made his claim. We won’t do so. Unfortunately, we failed to find any previous accounts of Cruz speaking to the department’s role in college student aid.

To our inquiry, Cruz campaign spokesman James Bernsen told us by email that Cruz has ""repeatedly made clear that he would not eliminate the funds to support a federal student loan program,"" preferring to give states ""more freedom to adopt policies at the local level.""

More broadly, Bernsen said, the ""elimination of a federal (agency) does not mean that critical divisions of the agency must be eliminated.""

We asked for evidence of Cruz’s repeated clarity about student financial aid, as described, and fielded none.

Our ruling

Sadler said Cruz wants to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and that federal college student aid would vanish as a result.

Cruz has been clear about wanting the agency gone -- and we also see the rationale behind saying, or speculating, that killing the department would end all its functions, including the provision of college aid. However, there is no record of Cruz confirming or even discussing that desire before the day Sadler issued this press release. Also, Cruz was recently quoted as saying he would preserve vital department functions such as teacher training, an indication he doesn’t favor dropping everything the agency does.

Ad says Obama leaves 'Creator' out of Declaration
","Is President Barack Obama disavowing the Creator?

A political action committee called Government Is Not God, or GING-PAC for short, has produced a newspaper ad claiming to reveal ""the true agenda of Barack Hussein Obama."" The group says it’s running the ad in several newspapers, mainly in Ohio and Florida.

The black-and-white ad includes a laundry list of claims against Obama, dealing with topics from Islamic law to abortion, most of which PolitiFact has debunked as False or Pants on Fire. The kicker: an accusation that Obama puts an atheistic spin on the Declaration of Independence. Obama, it says, is the ""only president in history who has deliberately removed the words ‘endowed by their Creator’ when referring to the Declaration of Independence not once but several times.""

First, a quick American history review. The Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776, in Philadelphia, proclaiming America’s separation from the British empire and asserting the right to govern itself. Here’s the most famous line, and the one at issue:

""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.""

Presidents and politicians often cite that line to stir the passions of voters. But is Obama unique among presidents in skipping the religious reference?

Indeed, we did find video of Obama paraphrasing the line and leaving out the ""Creator.""
At the 2010 Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute awards gala, he said it as, ""we hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, endowed with certain inalienable rights, life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""

Several conservative websites appear to be tracking his omissions.

But there’s also video evidence of Obama saying ""their Creator"" when citing the Declaration. The blog of the liberal group People for the American Way even put together a compilation video of Obama reciting the line verbatim.

But Obama's not ""the only president in history"" who has done it. A website that investigates urban legends dug up examples of Calvin Coolidge, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan omitting the ""Creator.""

Our ruling

GING-PAC’s ad says Obama is ""the only president in history who has deliberately removed the words.""

Not so. It’s true that Obama has omitted ""endowed by their Creator"" in speeches, but he’s also included those words many times. And at least three other presidents -- including Ronald Reagan -- have left out the Creator.

Jennifer Beck claims more people are working in New Jersey now than ever before
","
With a jobless rate that continues to inch up in New Jersey, some state officials are focusing on more optimistic labor data.

But after a report last week that showed the state’s unemployment rate ticked up to 9.9 percent as 5,300 jobs were added in August, a Republican lawmaker trying to accentuate the positive fumbled her facts.

""We have more people working in the state of New Jersey today than we've ever had in our history, "" state Sen. Jennifer Beck told NJToday on Sept. 20. ""So we still have a struggle with those that are unemployed and looking, but we know businesses feel positive about what's going on in our economy and they're looking to hire and we got to keep working at it.""

With a nearly double digit jobless rate, are more people working in New Jersey now than ever before?

That’s not true.

Beck said in an e-mail that she misspoke, saying she ""meant to say ‘workforce’ instead of ‘working.’""

But the key takeaway, she said, is ""that there are positive signs for our economy in the midst of some negative ones.""

The labor force, as measured by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, includes employed people and those unemployed but looking for a job. People who are unemployed and not seeking work are not counted.

In June the number of people in New Jersey’s labor force was the highest ever, but that figure dropped in July and again in August.

Also, as a percentage of the state’s population -- excluding individuals younger than 16 years old, people who are institutionalized and active duty service members -- there’s instances dating to the late 1980s of greater participation in the labor force than now.

As for employment, the state isn’t setting any records.

The number of employed residents -- as well as the number of jobs in New Jersey, which the federal labor department measures in a separate survey -- peaked in the beginning of 2008 before falling precipitously during the last recession.

From December 2007 through June 2009 -- the official start and end of the last recession, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research -- more than 140,000 New Jersey residents lost their job.

At the same time, the state shed more than 190,000 jobs overall, according to data from the federal labor department.

Any gains since then have not been substantial enough to push the state above pre-recession peaks.

In August, according to preliminary data, less than 4.13 million New Jersey residents were employed, down from nearly 4.29 million in February 2008.

The state had roughly 4.1 million jobs -- including public and private sector employment -- in January 2008. Now, the state has more than 3.9 million jobs overall.

So the raw numbers prove Beck wrong.

But it’s also important to compare labor data as a rate to account for the size of the population, which could impact employment figures.

For decades, New Jersey’s employment rate was better.

In August, according to preliminary data, about 90 percent of people in the state in the workforce -- that is either employed or looking for work -- had a job. That’s the smallest percentage since March of 1977.

Our ruling

Beck said, ""we have more people working in the state of New Jersey today than we've ever had in our history.""

That’s wrong.

New Jersey has not created enough jobs or put enough residents back to work to surpass the state’s 2008 employment peak.

And for decades the state’s employment rate was higher than it is now.

We rate this statement False.

Government is Not God PAC says Obama wants to allow Occupy protesters to live in parks
","
An ad that ran in newspapers in Florida and Ohio alleges that in President Barack Obama’s America, protesters would be allowed to live in parks.

""Barack Hussein Obama will move America to force local authorities to allow Occupy protesters to live in parks,"" it says, among a laundry list of claims on issues from abortion to gay parents to Islamic sharia law.

Occupy Wall Street is a loosely organized movement that famously set up camp in Manhattan’s Zuccotti Park on Sept. 17, 2011, among other public spaces around the country. The city ultimately cleared out the protesters’ tents, and a New York judge upheld the city’s right to do that.

Protesters could protest — they just couldn’t camp.

Does Obama want to change the law?

There’s a First Amendment right to peaceably assemble, but local governments are generally allowed to enforce time and place restrictions on those gatherings.

Specifically, the Supreme Court has ruled that governments may outlaw sleeping in parks, even during protests. Clark vs. Community for Creative Nonviolence, a 1984 case that involved a tent city in Washington, D.C., established that as long as rules are content-neutral — apply to everyone equally, no matter their message — sleeping in public is subject to ""reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions.""

One way the federal government might ""force"" local governments to allow protesters to live in parks might be to overturn that Supreme Court case, establishing precedent that the First Amendment right to assembly extends to camping out. A president can’t do that.

That’s assuming he wanted to.

William J. Murray, chairman of GINGPAC, provided us with three articles to back up the ad’s claim. The stories from the Washington Post, NBC New York and ABC document the president’s embrace of the protesters’ message: ""I understand the frustrations being expressed,"" Obama said.

But the articles don’t address whether Obama believes protesters should be allowed to camp out indefinitely in parks.

We looked for evidence that Obama might be interested in forcing authorities to allow such a thing. We found the opposite.

Take this exchange between a journalist and White House press secretary Jay Carney during a briefing on Jan. 20, 2012, which confirms the need to ""balance"" First Amendment concerns with ""public safety and public health concerns"" — in essence, current law. Carney, rather than criticize local police action, deferred to local authorities.

QUESTION: The Occupy Wall Street protesters are making headlines again. As you know, over the weekend 400 protesters were arrested in Oakland and now, today, the National Park Service is expected to clear out protesters potentially as we speak from a site here in D.C. What is your reaction? And is the administration concerned that some of these protesters are taking things too far?

CARNEY: Well, with regards to Oakland, that -- that's obviously a local law enforcement matter. Here in Washington, I would refer you for specifics to the U.S. National Park Service and the U.S. Park Police. And our position has been and continues to be that we need to balance First Amendment concerns of the right to demonstrate, the right to speak freely and -- with public safety concerns and public health concerns. And we understand that whether -- that local law enforcement, as well as in the case -- in this case the National Park Service and U.S. Park Police, are -- are weighing those considerations when they make these decisions and that's appropriate.

We found no evidence Obama has sought such an accommodation for the protesters. The president himself didn’t raise the issue in several briefings and interviews we found that touched on the protests. Rather, he focused on the content of the protests, such as regulation of Wall Street.

We chatted with Gene Policinski, senior vice president and executive director of the First Amendment Center, which followed the protests. Did the federal government show any indication of wanting to push against established law allowing local governments to outlaw camping?

""I saw no evidence of that anywhere during the Occupy movement,"" he told us. ""At the worst, it's a complete distortion. At the least, somebody misunderstands a request by citizens for due process.""

We reached out to Occupy Wall Street.

""It sounds like a bunch of crazy propaganda nonsense,"" said Dana Balicki, a member of the press team.

Our ruling

An ad from GINGPAC claimed, ""Barack Hussein Obama will move America to force local authorities to allow Occupy protesters to live in parks.""

There’s a First Amendment right to peaceably assemble, but local governments are generally allowed to enforce time and place restrictions on those gatherings. An expert from the First Amendment Center told us he saw no evidence that the president was interested in changing the law and we found no evidence of that in our searches. To the contrary, we found evidence of the administration supporting current law. And a president can’t overturn a Supreme Court decision, anyway.

Newspaper ad says Barack Obama will “force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers”
","
An ad placed by the socially conservative group Government Is Not God in the Sarasota, Fla., Herald-Tribune and other newspapers in Florida and Ohio claims President Barack Obama will ""force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers.""

Is that accurate?

William Murray, the group’s chairman, said the ad was a prediction that states ""what we believe Obama will do in a second term"" based in part on his current policies.

We are fact-checking the ad because it is a representation of Obama's actual policies and proposals. The ad even says its claims represent Obama's ""true agenda."" (The Sarasota newspaper has apologized for publishing the ad, saying it did not meet the paper's ""standards for fairness and accuracy."")

In the claim about hiring teachers, Murray offered two articles that indicated it was largely based on on a Supreme Court case, Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School vs. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  
The case involved a teacher at a Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod school named Cheryl Perich, a ""called"" teacher trained in theological requirements who taught mostly secular courses as well as some religious ones. In 2004 she developed narcolepsy and started the school year on leave with a disability. She wanted to return to the classroom in 2005, but the principal said the school had already filled the position for the year and had concerns about her illness.

The congregation asked Perich to resign, offering her a ""peaceful release"" from her call. She wouldn’t, and eventually the church fired her for insubordination and also for threatening legal action against the church. She filed an EEOC complaint that asserted she lost her job in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The Supreme Court, in a 9-0 decision on Jan. 11, 2012, ruled that her lawsuit should have been dismissed under the First Amendment’s ""ministerial exception"" protection for religious organizations to make their own decisions about their leaders.

""The church must be free to choose those who will guide it on its way,"" wrote Chief Justice John Roberts in the opinion.

The federal government was a party to the case -- the solicitor general’s office filed a brief and made an oral argument on behalf of the losing side. And so the Government Is Not God PAC is relying on the government's arguments as evidence for the ad’s claim that Obama will ""force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers.""

This raises two questions. First, if the solicitor general’s office makes an argument before the Supreme Court, does that mean that the arguments are those of Obama himself? And second, did the federal government actually argue in Hosanna-Tabor that the government has the right to ""force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers""?

We’ll take these two issues in order.

Does Obama ""own"" the Supreme Court arguments made by federal officials?

Experts told us this is a bit of a gray area.

On the one hand, ""the solicitor general is tasked with representing the United States and not solely the president of the United States,"" said Douglas W. Kmiec, a constitutional law professor at Pepperdine University and a former Justice Department official in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. ""It is therefore erroneous to ascribe the views of the solicitor general to those of the administration."" There is a strong tradition, he said, ""for the solicitor general to give an objective reading of the law.""

In addition, this case involved a federal statute and a federal agency, which gives a strong presumption that the federal government -- regardless of who occupied the White House -- would get involved, said Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia who argued against the government’s position at the Supreme Court oral argument for Hosanna-Tabor.

""The federal agency had won the case in the court of appeals, and the solicitor general pretty much had to defend that win,"" Laycock said. ""This was not an administration decision. … Occasionally, in very high-profile litigation, the White House gets involved and tells the solicitor general what to argue. But that is a rare event, and I don’t believe it happened here.""

That said, some legal experts said that the administration can’t fully disown what the solicitor general’s office was arguing. For one thing, it is not unprecedented for an administration to decline to defend a federal law (the Obama administration has already taken that course with the Defense of Marriage Act). It did not do so in this case.

And even if the solicitor general’s office didn’t have much choice about taking the case, it would have had some latitude in the specific arguments it would make. ""The solicitor general has some discretion in terms of the position to take,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

Did the government argue that it had the right to ""force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers""?

There’s some nuance here, too.

On the one hand, the administration took a more aggressive stance on behalf of government prerogatives in church-related conflicts than some legal observers had expected. Indeed, it was a view that was so aggressive that it was rejected by a unanimous court, including two appointees of Obama himself.

Richard W. Garnett, a University of Notre Dame law professor who wrote a brief countering the government’s view in Hosanna-Tabor, calls the solicitor general’s arguments in the brief and oral argument ""extreme and misguided."" The solicitor general’s argument, he said, was that the plaintiffs should be able to use federal discrimination laws to challenge employment decisions by Christian schools regarding teachers, and that the First Amendment’s religion clauses do not provide any shield against government second-guessing of such decisions.  

""At oral argument, ‘liberal’ and ‘conservative’ justices alike were surprised"" at the reach of the government’s argument, Garnett said.

That said, Garnett said it’s a stretch to say the solicitor general argued that the government should be able to ""force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers."" He and other experts said that the question of religious institutions being able to hire people of certain religions is settled law and an issue that the government did not quarrel with.

""It’s not so much that the administration would come in and say to a Christian school, ‘You must hire a non-Christian teacher,’"" Garnett said. ""It’s that, if a teacher were fired by a Christian school, then that teacher’s employment-discrimination lawsuit should be able to go forward as if the Christian school were any other (non-religious) association.""

Roosevelt makes an even more forceful case. Basing the ad on the argument in Hosanna-Tabor, he said, is ""totally false."" ""That’s not what the case was about, the solicitor general never suggested it, and the law clearly allows Christian schools to hire Christian teachers,"" he said.

Even Laycock, who faced off against the solicitor general at the oral argument, said the ad is misconstruing the solicitor general’s argument.

The solicitor general ""never implied or said that Christian schools would have to hire non-Christian teachers,"" Laycock said. ""The statute is absolutely clear that religious institutions can discriminate on the basis of religion, and of course they never questioned that. The issue was whether religion teachers could sue their churches alleging other kinds of discrimination – disability in this case. We said no, the solicitor general said sometimes yes, when the case could be decided without interfering in the church’s religious mission. We didn’t think that was a workable standard. The disagreement about disability discrimination would have applied to sex discrimination and age discrimination as well, but it clearly did not apply to religious discrimination -- that was common ground."" 
Murray also cited an article about Chai Feldblum, a Georgetown University law professor appointed by President Obama to serve on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that said she has written that society should ""not tolerate"" any ""private beliefs,"" including religious beliefs, that may negatively affect homosexual ""equality."" But Murray did not provide any evidence that her actions at the EEOC would force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers. 
Our ruling

The ad claims that Obama will ""force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers."" But he has not sought to do that himself and the only evidence is a weak link to the solicitor general's argument in the Hosanna-Tabor case. 
The case did address the proper balance between the government and religious institutions in personnel decisions, but even participants in the case say the government did not say what the ad claims.

PAC ad says Obama will force Christian groups to pay for abortions
","
A super PAC called Government is Not God is running an ad in newspapers around the country warning readers of dire consequences if the president wins a second term.

""Barack Hussein Obama,"" the ad says, ""will move America to force Christian organizations to pay for abortion.""

That claim tops a list of numerous charges about abortion, immigration, Islam and even the Declaration of Independence, which we’ll look at in separate-fact checks.

For this one, the topic is abortion.

HHS rule

The claim is based on a rule to implement the new health care law that was announced in January 2012 by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. It addressed women’s preventive health services that must be covered by insurers without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible.

At issue is how much organizations with religious ties would be bound by the rule.

It was a clarification of the provision in the Affordable Care Act, often known as Obamacare, for co-pay-free preventive care. For individual and small-group plans, the law requires that policies cover ""essential health benefits."" The idea of co-pay-free preventive care stems from studies that show that even moderate co-pays kept women from getting care, such as mammograms or pap smears, according to HHS. The nongovernmental Institute of Medicine recommended that preventive services include all FDA-approved forms of contraception: physical methods such as condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps and IUDs, as well as hormonal methods such as the pill, implants and hormone shots. It includes emergency contraceptives such as Plan B and Ella, though not so-called ""abortion drugs"" like RU-486 that end early pregnancy by blocking the activity of progesterone.

Most health insurance plans will have to cover them without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible. For most new and renewed health plans, that requirement kicked in Aug. 1, 2012.

Religious exemptions
   
The HHS rule provides an exemption for ""certain non-profit religious employers"" that meet a four-part test -- essentially churches and synagogues, but also some primary and secondary religious schools. That left other religious-affiliated organizations, such as universities and hospitals, outside the exemption and in a position where they could be required to cover services to which they have a moral objection.

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, along with other groups and conservative leaders, rose up to fight the rule. Here’s why: Plan B and Ella -- the ""morning-after pill"" -- prevent fertilization of an egg, but taken later can prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg. To some, that’s tantamount to inducing an abortion.

""In a Catholic moral perspective and in the view of many other pro-life people, this is an early abortifacient effect, not merely contraceptive, because it ends a life that has already come into being. However, federal law would not define this as an abortion, because it only covers the interruption of an implanted pregnancy,"" Richard Doerflinger, associate director of Pro-Life Activities at the bishops conference, told PolitiFact.

In response to the uproar, the administration offered a compromise in February, requiring insurance companies instead of employers to cover contraception if the employer objects. The organizations were also given an extra year to comply with the rule.

A White House fact sheet says religious organizations will not have to provide contraceptive coverage or refer their employees to organizations that provide contraception, religious organizations will not be required to subsidize the cost of contraception, and contraceptive coverage will be offered to women by their employers’ insurance companies directly, with no role for religious employers who oppose contraception.

To those objecting to the rule, the compromise is little more than a shell game.

Said Doerflinger: ""The actual money for this coverage will still come from the premiums paid in by the employer and employee. … The Catholic employer, as much as before, is deprived of its freedom to provide a health plan (and its employees are deprived of the freedom to receive a health plan, for themselves and their minor children) that conforms to their moral and religious principles.""

More than two dozen lawsuits against the Obama administration over the rule are pending around the country.

So, is the claim accurate?

Doerflinger says yes.

""The mandate includes drugs that can cause an abortion; and we haven’t seen a workable scenario in which the money for covering such drugs comes from anywhere but the premiums paid by many Christian employers and their employees,"" he said.

We also asked NARAL Pro-Choice America, an abortion rights group, for its take:

""The new contraceptive-coverage policy referenced in the claim … will not force Christian organizations to pay for abortion. The policy requires coverage of all FDA-approved forms of birth control, including emergency contraception (EC). EC is not abortion, rather, it prevents pregnancy. Therefore, no one is required to cover abortion under this policy,"" said Samantha Gordon, spokeswoman for NARAL. ""Also, the administration explicitly exempts religious houses of worship from the contraceptive-coverage requirement. Moreover, the policy allows religiously affiliated employers that presently refuse to offer their employees contraceptive coverage a one-year grace period to come into compliance. These organizations also will be allowed to opt out of the policy permanently if they oppose it.""

Our conclusion: There is a narrow window in this claim that has some truth.

The wording -- ""Christian organizations will be forced to pay for abortions"" -- is clearly an overreach. Christian organizations won’t be ""forced"" to hand over money for abortion procedures performed at clinics by doctors.

But because employers are now required to provide health insurance for employees under the Affordable Care Act (or otherwise face fines) and because that law dictates that preventive care must be provided at no cost to the insured person, there is some force being applied by the federal government. Preventive care, as defined by HHS, encompasses birth control, emergency contraceptives and sterilization -- health services that some people equate with abortion.

Overall, the statement creates a misleading impression. But that one element of truth leads us to rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/sep/26/government-not-god-pac/pac-ad-says-obama-will-force-christian-groups-pay-/

PAC claims Obama would force sharia law on courts
","
President Barack Obama is a Christian, but a political action committee called Government is not God says his religious sympathies lie elsewhere. The group paid for ads in newspapers across Florida and Ohio that warned, among other things, that if Barack Hussein Obama is re-elected, he ""will move America to force courts to accept Islamic sharia law in domestic disputes.""

We asked the man behind this ad, William Murray, to provide some supporting evidence. Murray cited an item from an anti-sharia group that claimed that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan is ""pro-sharia."" The evidence was Kagan's encouragement of Islamic legal studies at Harvard. None of Murray's sources referred to the issue of courts and domestic law.

Murray also said he was making a prediction and that it is impossible to fact check a prediction. But we are not checking the accuracy of his crystal ball. We are fact-checking whether Obama has said he would force courts to accept Islamic sharia law -- and whether such action is even possible under the U.S. Constitution.

Last January, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals shot down an Oklahoma law that blocked state courts from considering or using sharia law. The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines sharia law as ""Islamic law based on the Koran.""

The circuit court held that the Oklahoma measure discriminated among religions and thus was unconstitutional.

The other item we found was in a Kansas divorce case. The husband in the case, who was Muslim, wanted the property divided according to a marriage contract in keeping with sharia law.

In neither case did we find any evidence of action by the Obama administration.

Other legal experts confirm this. Glenn Hendrix is managing partner in the Atlanta-based law firm of Arnall Golden Gregory and past chair of the American Bar Association’s section on International Law. Hendrix said there’s no substance to the ad’s claim. On top of that, he said it suffers from a fundamental legal flaw related to the separation of powers.

""Even if the administration were somehow pushing sharia law -- and of course it’s not,"" Hendrix said, ""the executive branch cannot force courts to accept any particular law.""

Hendrix said the Constitution and court precedent trump religious law and cited a bar association report on religious law. 
""Our courts (both state and federal) have more than sufficient legal tools to permit them to reject foreign or religious law and refuse to enforce foreign judgments that do not meet our fundamental standards of fairness and justice. Constitutional rights (such as those contained in the Bill of Rights) protect everyone in the United States, and all courts throughout the country are bound to respect them. Under our Constitutional order, these rights cannot be infringed, even where foreign or religious law has been chosen by the parties."" 

Hendrix said the only time that a court might rely on sharia law is if it needs to determine the validity of a marriage and the marriage was conducted in an Islamic country.

Our ruling

Sherrod Brown campaign ad targets Josh Mandel on truthfulness about investment fund
","
Truthfulness has become a persistent issue in the U.S. Senate campaign between Sherrod Brown, the Democratic incumbent, and Josh Mandel, Ohio's Republican treasurer.

The Brown campaign raised the issue explicitly this month in a 30-second TV ad titled ""Pants on Fire."" 
The ad accuses Mandel of being ""the candidate of the big lie,"" and displays a newspaper column as the source for the line.

""Now Josh is lying about his own record,"" the ad says. ""The rating of Ohio's investment fund has NOT improved."" The capital letters for emphasis are in the on-screen text of the words.

The claim sounded familiar to PolitiFact Ohio, and with reason. When we asked the Brown campaign for supporting sources, they cited a fact-check by us and another by our friends at FactCheck.org. When we looked further, we found a third related fact-check by PolitiFact Ohio.

The first item, from October 2011, reviewed the claim in a Mandel campaign email about the STAR (State Treasury Asset Reserve) Ohio fund, an investment pool with assets of more than $4.1 billion through which the state treasurer invests money for local governments.

The campaign email said the STAR Ohio fund ""just received the highest possible credit rating one of these funds can receive.""

The source for the claim was the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's, which sent the state a letter in August 2011 affirming a AAAm rating for the STAR Ohio fund.

While that is the highest possible rating, STAR Ohio has received a AAAm rating since 1995, the first year S&P rated the fund. Public finance experts told us the treasurer deserved credit for maintaining the bond rating but did not ""achieve"" it.

We found then that a reader could reasonably assume from his email that the rating had gone up. Because the rating already had been in place for 16 years and did not improve under Mandel, we said his email overstated the case. We rated the statement Half True.

FactCheck.org, in May 2012, looked at a Mandel ad that said he ""earned the highest possible credit ratings as state treasurer.""

That statement ""could give viewers the impression that Mandel improved the state’s credit ratings, but that is not the case,"" FactCheck.org concluded. ""Under Mandel, the state’s STAR Ohio investment fund has maintained its 'AAA' rating from Standard & Poor’s. But even the state treasurer’s office acknowledges that the fund has had that same rating since 1995.""

We also looked at that same ad statement last May, and found it more carefully worded than the claim in the email we examined earlier. Unlike the email, the statement did not imply that the credit rating had ""just"" improved.

Because the statement was accurate but needed for clarification the additional information that the rating had been AAAm for 16 years, we rated it Mostly True.

That brings us back to the Brown campaign’s TV ad.

First, it is important to know that the fund already had achieved the highest possible rating. There was not room for improvement in the rating, as could be reasonably inferred from the TV ad.

More importantly, though, the ad targets Mandel’s character, questioning his truthfulness, and makes the claim that he ""is lying about his own record. The rating of Ohio's investment fund has NOT improved.""

Ohio's investment fund has not improved under Mandel. And a natural reading of that claim is that Mandel at some point claimed it had improved.

Except in the materials the Brown campaign cited in support of the ad, Mandel doesn’t actually say the rating went up. But that’s the clear implication the ad makes when it says he is now lying about his record.

And PolitiFact Ohio has never heard him make that claim.

PolitiFact Ohio previously rated as Mostly True the claim by Mandel's campaign that he ""earned the highest possible credit ratings"" for investment funds managed by the treasurer's office.  We found that the claim needed additional information for clarification, but that it was accurate.

When we rated Mandel’s claim in his email Half True for overstatement, that was for his use of the words """"just received,"" which we said could give the impression that the rating was new. He did not say in that email that the rating for the STAR Ohio fund had gone up.

While the claims put the best possible spin on Mandel's performance, they do not qualify as ""lying about his record."" In that regard, the suggestion from the ad that he said the rating increased is just deceptive and incorrect.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the Brown campaign ad’s claim rates False.",/factchecks/2012/sep/26/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-campaign-ad-targets-josh-mandel-trut/

NRA attacks Bill Nelson for voting to confirm Sonia Sotomayor to Supreme Court
","
The National Rifle Association wants Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson out of office.

A flier mailed to some Floridians by the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action compares Nelson’s record on gun control with that of his Republican opponent in the U.S. Senate race, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV.

One of its points: ""Bill Nelson voted to confirm Barack Obama's anti-gun nominees to the Supreme Court -- including Sonia Sotomayor who signed a Supreme Court opinion saying Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms.""

For this fact-check, we wanted to confirm whether Nelson voted for Sotomayor and if she signed an opinion that said ""Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms.""

The first part is easy for us: Nelson voted to confirm Sotomayor, Obama’s first Supreme Court nominee and the country’s first Hispanic justice, on Aug. 6, 2009, in a 68-31 vote.

The second part -- that she signed a Supreme Court opinion saying Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms -- is a little harder to understand (at least, for those of us not trained in legalese).

An NRA spokesman refused to elaborate on the ad’s claim for PolitiFact Florida, including which opinion is even at issue here. Still, given her short tenure and the scarcity of possible gun rulings, it didn’t take long to figure out.

McDonald vs. Chicago

It may not say it, but the ad is a reference to the 2010 Supreme Court case McDonald vs. Chicago, which dealt with handgun bans in Chicago and the Chicago suburb of Oak Park.

It picked up where a landmark (pre-Sotomayor) Supreme Court decision left off. In 2008, the court ruled in District of Columbia vs. Heller that the Second Amendment includes an individual right of gun ownership, overturning a D.C. ban on handguns.

Heller dealt with federal law and left undetermined whether this interpretation of the Second Amendment applied to state and local government restrictions on guns.  In McDonald, the court had to decide whether to ""incorporate"" the Second Amendment against the states. (Since the Civil War, the court has ""incorporated,"" or extended, amendments within the Bill of Rights against state and local governments under the due process and equal protection provisions of the 14th Amendment.)

By a 5-4 majority, the court argued in McDonald that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to own a gun against the regulations of state and local governments. The New York Times called the case ""an enormous symbolic victory for gun rights.""

This wasn’t the ruling Sotomayor wanted. She signed a 31-page dissenting opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer and co-signed by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, both Bill Clinton appointees.

Breyer’s opinion argued that using guns for self-defense did not warrant federal constitutional protection. The Heller decision, Breyer wrote, was grounded in an ambiguous historical record that did not substantiate a private self-defense right against the states. The Second Amendment was enacted to protect militia-related rights, he said, and decisions on gun control should be determined by local governments and legislatures.

Many news accounts of the ruling honed in on this line from the conclusion: ""In sum, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment in order to protect a private right of armed self-defense.""

That mirrors the NRA’s claim about Sotomayor, said many experts we consulted.

""This is an easy one,"" said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute.

""The characterization of her opinion is accurate,"" said David Kopel, research director of the libertarian-leaning Independence Institute and an adjunct constitutional law professor at Denver University. ""She joined an opinion that said Heller should be overruled.""

Advocates of gun control saw more nuance.

""It was certainly not anti-gun,"" said Daniel Vice, senior attorney at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""The dissenting opinion did not pick a side in the gun debate.""

At issue was the more technical question about incorporating private armed self-defense as a ""fundamental"" right, he said. Was the right to keep a gun at home as central to U.S. citizenship as voting, freedom of speech and freedom religion that it deserved protection under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment?

""That’s a different question than the question of whether the right exists or not,"" said Brian Van Houten, Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence managing attorney. ""(The NRA) presented a very dramatic claim about Justice Sotomayor’s opinion in McDonald, but it doesn’t match the reality of what was said there.""

Others urged us to consider the alternative. If the opinion of Breyer and Sotomayor prevailed, states would have a lot more freedom to regulate gun ownership.

""Effectively, (the NRA) may be correct in the sense that had the court ruled that the Second Amendment was not incorporated, it would have left the states free to legislate in any way they choose,"" said William Vizzard, California State University Sacramento criminal justice professor.

We should expect litigation out of McDonald for years to come, he said. 
The important note to all of this, of course, is that Nelson voted to confirm Sotomayor before her vote in McDonald. In the mailer, the NRA fails to provide this context, which in turn could confuse voters. 
Our ruling

The NRA is correct in saying Nelson voted to confirm Sonia Sotomayor as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. And many experts see the group’s assertion that she signed an opinion ""saying Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms"" as fair.

We heard lots of agreement from experts about this characterization, though two advocates of gun control said it is over-simplified. Gun-control supporters in particular told us the opinion she signed is not as ""anti-gun"" as the mailer would have readers believe. 
What's missing from this attack is the context that Nelson voted to confirm Sotomayor before she signed the opinion in McDonald. That context slightly dulls the connection between Nelson and Sotomayor's position.

Overall, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/sep/26/national-rifle-association/nra-attacks-bill-nelson-voting-confirm-sonia-sotom/

Campfield claimed Memphis can’t destroy guns from buyback program
","
Colorful State Sen. Stacey Campfield seems to court controversy, particularly in his blog, Camp4u.

So it was no real surprise when he took a reproachful tone in blog posts on Sept. 11 about the ""gas for guns"" program announced the day before by the City of Memphis and the Memphis Police Department. The city held a press conference on Sept. 10 to announce that on Sept. 15, it would conduct an event in which it would give people a $50 Mapco gas card plus two tickets to a Memphis Grizzlies basketball game for turning in a gun. The idea was to get guns off the streets, and 497 guns were exchanged for the cards and tickets at the event. The city said most of the guns would be ""destroyed.""

""I don’t think they can do that,"" Campfield wrote in his first blog post on the gas for guns program, adding that ""…the point of this post is that the city is saying they intend on destroying the guns they buy. I may be wrong but didn’t we change the law to say they have to resell the guns now?""

The senator cited the Tennessee legislature passing a bill in 2010 regarding what local law enforcement can do with guns but acknowledged he might be wrong with exactly whether it applied to gun ""buyback"" programs similar to the Memphis initiative.

Nearly an hour later, Campfield  posted a second item that sounded as if he had verified that the city’s program could not destroy the guns as it intended. Under the headline ""Sorry Memphis,"" the senator wrote: ""I was right. The city of Memphis/Memphis PD is wrong (I know, a real shocker). As I recalled, you can’t destroy the guns purchased in a gun buy program as the city wants to do. They have to be re sold (sic) to a licensed gun dealer. Someone should alert them. I would hate to see our law enforcement in violation of the law.""

Clearly, somebody was firing a dud, so we decided to look into the matter.

Campfield was recalling the 2010 law that prohibits local law enforcement from destroying certain guns, but his recollection was a little off on which guns. Tennessee Code Annotated 39-17-1317 governs the disposition of ""confiscated weapons"" only, and the 2010 amendment to the statute removed destruction of guns as an option for confiscated guns, unless they are certified by local police as ""inoperable or unsafe.""

But otherwise, after a confiscated gun is no longer needed for evidence, local law enforcement may ask a court to declare it contraband. ""Any weapon declared contraband shall be sold in a public sale or used for legitimate law enforcement purposes, at the discretion of the court."" The law goes on to say how the gun must be sold -- a public auction or through a private gun dealer.

When the 2010 amendment was briefly discussed in the legislature, its sponsors said it was sought by the National Rifle Association. The NRA in fact posted on its website an alert encouraging its members to urge then-Gov. Phil Bredesen to sign it into law. He did.

Campfield linked to the NRA’s 2010 alert in his blog post, but even the alert made note that the law applies only to confiscated guns: The bill ""would prohibit the destruction of confiscated firearms and require them to be auctioned off or sold to a federally licensed firearms dealer,"" it said.

But can guns voluntarily surrendered by people to the police – even if in exchange for cash or gasoline debit cards or pro basketball tickets – be considered ""confiscated"" under the law?

Ultimately, that may be a question for the courts if anyone challenges the legality of the program, but our dictionary says ""confiscate"" means ""appropriated by the government; forfeited; deprived of property by confiscation,"" and ""to seize as forfeited to the public treasury; to seize by authority.""

Memphis believes its program is within the state law, city spokeswoman Mary Cashiola wrote in an email to The Commercial Appeal: ""The firearms collected during Saturday’s Gas for Guns event will be turned in voluntarily by citizens. . . . The Memphis Police Department will take possession of the exchanged weapons and will handle these weapons in accordance with State law.""  
The state attorney general’s office does not appear to have rendered a legal opinion on the statute, so we turned to Nashville lawyer John Harris, a gun advocate who founded the Tennessee Firearms Association.

Harris told us in an email hat he doesn’t believe the law prohibits Memphis from destroying guns obtained through the gas for guns initiative. ""As I understand it, TCA 39-17-1317 only applies to weapons that were ‘possessed, used or sold in violation of the law’ and, based on that use, ‘confiscated by a law enforcement officer and declared to be contraband by a court of record exercising criminal jurisdiction.’ The prohibition on the destruction of such weapons under this statute (with limited exceptions) thus only applies to those weapons that were specifically ‘confiscated’ and ‘declared to be contraband’. I do not think that the statute would apply on its face to firearms ‘buy back’ programs conduct by state or local agencies.""

Harris did say, however, that he believes the ""intentional destruction of functional weapons violates the spirit of the law"" and that he anticipates that the TFA will seek to close the buyback loophole. ""While it might appear to be ‘politically correct’ to destroy legal items with material value, it’s foolish and government should not be doing foolish things,"" he said.

Contacted by PolitiFact on Sept. 20, Campfield said he had already changed his mind on his blog post, after speaking with legislative lawyers. ""For buybacks, it is different than for guns confiscated. The way it was originally written it would have covered buybacks. But when I had legal look at it, I don’t think it covers buybacks. All the early stuff I had said, no they can’t do it.""

Our ruling

It is PolitiFact policy to take into account when someone later acknowledges an original claim was somehow incorrect. Often, those statements are made during live interviews, but in this case Campfield took the time to write up and post not one but two items onto his blog declaring that it would be illegal for Memphis to destroy guns purchased in a buy-back program.

Campfield hadn’t altered his blog post as of this writing. We give him a ruling of False. ",/factchecks/2012/sep/26/stacey-campfield/campfield-claimed-memphis-destroy-guns-buy-back/

AFSCME says Thompson backs big tax cuts for companies that outsource Wisconsin jobs
","
Employment boomed in Wisconsin during Tommy Thompson’s 14 years as governor, ending in early 2001.

But as the Republican tries a political comeback in his bid for the U.S. Senate, his opponents want voters to look at Thompson’s post-gubernatorial career when evaluating his job-creation proposals.

That’s the focus of a TV ad funded by the political arm of AFSCME, a major public-sector labor union. It features an animated bobble-head motif.

""Tommy Thompson’s changed all right,"" the ad says, making a series of allegations after a short video snippet.

Among them: ""Tommy even went to work for companies that ship American jobs overseas,"" the spot says, showing a smiling ""Thompson"" shoving a boatload of jobs off shore from the California coast.

The ad’s kicker: ""Now Thompson supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs.""

AFSCME wouldn’t talk to us about the ad. But the spot cites two pieces of evidence in the footnotes to support the claim that Thompson ""supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs.""

That’s the claim we’ll evaluate here.

One is Thompson’s speech at the GOP state convention on May 12, 2012. The other is a March 22, 2012, analysis by the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice of the budget plan pushed by House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan.

Let’s start with the Ryan budget plan, which has received greater scrutiny since Mitt Romney elevated Ryan to the GOP presidential ticket.

In analyzing Ryan’s budget, Citizens for Tax Justice touches on two issues that, as best we can tell, AFSCME is relying on to back up the ad.

Ryan, the group notes in its analysis, wants to cut the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, and exempt the offshore profits of multinational American corporations from the income tax. (Romney does too.)

This, the group contends, would ""increase the existing incentives for U.S. corporations to move their operations offshore or use accounting gimmicks to make their U.S. profits appear to be ‘foreign’ profits generated in offshore tax havens.""

OK. But what does this have to do with Tommy Thompson?

In the May 2012 convention speech cited by the ad, Thompson endorsed Ryan’s budget plan as a whole, unequivocally. That plan does contain those tax proposals.

""I will pass Paul Ryan’s budget plan in the U.S. Senate,"" he said. ""It is the right plan, at the right time, for America.""

Let’s take a closer look at AFSCME’s claim.

First, the terminology in the ad needs clarification.

The AFSCME ad depicts cartoon Tommy as supporting tax cuts for ""outsourcers"" in Wisconsin. But, the Citizens for Tax Justice report makes no mention of ""outsourcing.""

The group’s report focuses on ""offshoring,"" which the National Academy of Public Administration defined as ""U.S. firms shifting service and manufacturing activities abroad to unaffiliated firms or their own affiliates.""

""Outsourcing"" can involve offshoring, but it often refers to firms contracting out service and manufacturing activities to unaffiliated firms in the United States, according to the academy.

The two terms, we should note, are sometimes used interchangeably despite the key differences.

We asked academic experts about the potential effect of exempting offshore profits from taxation, an approach known as ""territorial"" taxation.

We found little dispute of the increased incentive to move jobs overseas under a territorial system, but a very unsettled debate over the ultimate effect on jobs of such a change.

A scholar cited by Citizens for Tax Justice, James Repetti, professor at Boston College Law School, is in the camp that believes more production will move overseas, but said that the real-world impact of such a change is very hard to predict.

William McBride, chief economist at the business-backed Tax Foundation, cites studies to show that investment abroad is associated with investment domestically.

""So it is not a zero-sum game, it is additional growth, and some of the benefits come back to the U.S. in the form of dividends and high-paying management and R&D jobs, for instance,"" McBride told us in an email.

President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have cited a July 2012 study by Reed College economist Kimberly Clausing. She calculated that low-tax countries would gain 800,000 jobs under the incentives in a ""territorial"" tax system. (Clausing noted the number would fall if the U.S. corporate tax rate was cut -- as Ryan has proposed -- and that in a good economy, jobs abroad need not displace jobs at home).

At the same time, a bipartisan commission appointed by Obama recommended a territorial tax system in 2010.

""The U.S. is one of the only industrialized countries with a hybrid system of taxing active foreign-source income. The current system puts U.S. corporations at a competitive disadvantage against their foreign competitors,"" said the report of the commission popularly known as Simpson-Bowles.

Overall, we found no dispute that the tax rewards from a rate cut and exemption of offshore profits could be very significant for corporations.

Currently, companies can defer taxation until returning those profits to the United States -- and studies estimate those profits at more than $1 trillion. That approach has been criticized as providing a disincentive for firms to bring profits back home. Firms, as Ryan’s plan notes, have to pay foreign taxes on income earned abroad, then U.S. taxes when they ""repatriate"" those profits -- bring them back home.

There’s a final factor here.

Thompson has put forward his own specific proposal on corporate taxation, as part of his ""Restore America"" plan.

He says it’s his attempt to address the ""perverse incentives that cause companies to reinvest foreign profits oversees (sic) rather than repatriating those profits.""

His campaign declined to discuss it, but Thompson’s plan calls for a permanent tax break on profits ""repatriated"" to the U.S. He wants zero taxation on those profits -- a lower rate than in some similar plans by conservatives -- but attaches the condition that they must be used for investment in plant and equipment, job training or research and development.

Thompson’s plan pertains to future profits -- but he also wants to encourage companies to repatriate, at zero taxation, that $1 trillion in foreign profits that have built up over time.

The impact of that approach is uncertain, but Thompson is in the camp that believes injecting some of that money back into the U.S. would create jobs back home.

Our rating

AFSCME contends that Thompson ""supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs.""

Despite the confusing use of ""outsourcing,"" the claim is partly on target, in that Thompson would completely exempt from taxation U.S. companies’ profits from overseas operations under certain conditions.

There are two important caveats here. Researchers differ on whether U.S. employment would decline under this ""territorial"" tax approach, with some arguing that businesses would invest more at home as a result of the tax break.

And part of Thompson’s plan provides incentives that could convince companies to bring profits back home.

This rates a Half True.

Chris Christie says America has fewer jobs than when Barack Obama became president
","Missouri residents will head to the polls Nov. 6 to choose between re-electing their Democratic governor or tapping his Republican challenger for the job, but New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has another name for voters to keep in mind: President Barack Obama.

At a Sept. 23 rally in the Show-Me State for Republican gubernatorial candidate Dave Spence, Christie told the crowd a vote for Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon is a vote for Obama. To make his case, the Republican governor argued that Nixon and Obama both have overseen job losses.

""Gov. Jay Nixon’s path here in Missouri is identical to the president’s path,"" said Christie, according to a YouTube video of his speech. ""Fewer jobs in America today than when Barack Obama became president, fewer jobs in Missouri today than before Jay Nixon became governor.

""They are the same,"" Christie went on. ""You vote for Jay Nixon, that’s a vote for President Obama. That’s not what Missourians want. You want Dave Spence as the next governor of Missouri.""

But Christie is off target in attacking Obama over job losses.

Based on the most recent federal labor statistics, it’s accurate to say there are fewer jobs nationwide than there were in January 2009, when Obama was sworn in. But compared with February 2009 -- Obama’s first full month in office -- there has been a net increase of 463,000 jobs. Christie's claim also ignores the fact that the nation has created more than 3.4 million jobs over 23 consecutive months of employment gains. The governor’s office did not respond to two e-mails seeking comment.

Let’s break down the numbers.

Amid an ongoing recession, Obama took office in early 2009 at a time when the nation already had lost millions of jobs in the preceding year. The country continued to lose jobs each month until early 2010, when monthly job growth began to occur.

As of August 2012, the nation had seen 23 consecutive months of growth in total non-farm jobs, including both public- and private-sector employment, according to the most recent seasonally adjusted data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those gains totaled more than 3.4 million jobs.

The latest numbers show the nation had 133.3 million total jobs in August, representing the largest monthly total since January 2009, when Obama was sworn in. That figure is preliminary.

How does that figure compare to when Obama became president?

Well, compared to January 2009, there has been a net decrease of 261,000 jobs.

However, when we start counting in February 2009 -- Obama’s first full month in office -- the numbers tell a different story. Fast forward to August 2012, and we find a net increase of 463,000 jobs. For an overview of total jobs and monthly changes between January 2009 and August 2012, check out the chart at the bottom of this page.

Still, as we’ve noted in previous stories, it’s wrong to completely credit or blame a president -- or a governor for that matter -- for job gains and losses. There are multiple factors involved beyond the control of the chief executive.

Our ruling

At a campaign rally in Missouri, Christie said there are ""fewer jobs in America today than when Barack Obama became president.""

If we start counting with January 2009, when Obama was sworn in, the governor’s claim is right. Between that month and August 2012, there has been a net decrease of 261,000 jobs.

But that figure is misleading. Starting with February 2009, which was Obama’s first full month in office, there has been a net increase of 463,000 jobs. Overall, the nation’s employment picture has been steadily improving with 23 consecutive months of total job growth.

Therefore, Christie’s claim ""contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""

Joaquin Castro: Texas has gone the longest of all states not electing a Democrat to statewide office
","During a Texas Tribune Festival discussion, state Rep. Joaquin Castro suggested Texas ranks No. 1 in a dubious category for Democrats.

The San Antonio Democrat, nominated this year for a U.S. House seat, said: ""We are the state that has now gone the longest without electing a Democrat statewide. It has been since 1994 that a Democrat has been elected in Texas."" The claim was noted for us by University of Texas journalism student Joshua Fechter.

The last Democrats were elected statewide in 1994. Those victors included Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, Attorney General Dan Morales and State Comptroller John Sharp. In the year's marquee race, Republican George W. Bush denied Gov. Ann Richards a second term.

And have Texas Democrats been shut out of statewide office longer than Democrats elsewhere?

We left Castro a message seeking backup information, then recalled that the Associated Press said in a July 30, 2012, news article: ""Texas Democrats have the longest losing streak in the nation in statewide elections."" The story suggested the party’s July 31 runoff for its U.S. Senate nomination would indicate if Democrats had hopes of changing that record this year.

To gauge whether Texas has the nation’s longest current stretch of statewide Democratic also-rans, we looked first at which states have Democratic governors.Twenty states have Democratic governors, according to the National Governors Association, while Rhode Island has an Independent chief executive and the others are led by Republicans.

Of the 28 states outside Texas with Republican governors, 15 have at least one Democratic senator, the Senate roster shows, as does Rhode Island. Each of these senators would have last won election in 2006 or later.

This got us down to 13 red-hued states: Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming. But 10 of them saw Democrats elected governor later than 1995, according to information kept by the governors association.

This result left us with three states potentially more long-lastingly difficult for Democrats running statewide than Texas: Idaho, South Carolina and Utah.

Scratch South Carolina; Democratic Sen. Ernest ""Fritz"" Holliings won his last term in 1998, four years after the latest Texas Democrats won statewide. Hollings did not seek re-election in 2004.

Similarly, interviews confirmed, voters in Idaho and Utah elected Democrats statewide after 1994.

Like Texas, Idaho last had a Democratic governor, Cecil Andrus, through 1994. But Democrat Marilyn Howard was elected superintendent of public instruction in 1998 and re-elected in 2002, serving through 2006, according to Dean Ferguson, communications director for the Idaho Democratic Party.

In Utah, lawyer and Democrat Jan Graham won her second term as attorney general in 1996, serving to 2001, according to a biographical entry on her law firm’s website. ""Graham is the only woman in Utah’s history to be elected to a statewide office,"" the entry says.

As we completed this look, Castro spokesman Cary Clack said he didn’t know how Castro learned of, or determined, this factoid.

Our ruling

Texas voters have not elected a Democrat to statewide office for longer than voters in any other state. Castro’s statement rates as True.",/factchecks/2012/sep/26/joaquin-castro/joaquin-castro-says-texas-has-gone-longest-all-sta/

Cherry-picked numbers don't tell full story
","In a discussion about his endorsement by the International Association of Firefighters, Dodd likened himself to John Kerry in the 2004 campaign to suggest that Dodd could still win the nomination:
 
""John Kerry was at 4 percent in the polls in December of 2003, two points behind Al Sharpton and 22 points behind Howard Dean. And he ended up becoming the nominee of the party,"" he said Wednesday, August 29, 2007, on CNN's

The Situation Room.

 
We find it's not a fair comparison. Dodd is not only understating Kerry's strength in the polls, but overstating his own.
 
First, his subtraction was off, which the Dodd campaign acknowledged in an e-mail to us last week.
Dodd was citing a Dec. 10-13, 2003, CBS/New York Times poll. It showed Kerry at 4 percent, behind Al Sharpton at 6 and Dean at 23 (The subtraction error was that Kerry was 19 percentage points behind Dean, not 22 points as Dodd said).
 
Dodd chose to cite polls that showed Kerry at an especially low point — 4 percent. Indeed, there were four polls showing Kerry at that level.
 
But other polls that same month showed Kerry with more support. There were other polls that had him between 5 and 8 percent, and two that had him at 10 percent.
 
Dodd's biggest stretch is his attempt to liken his poll standing to Kerry. In most polls conducted this year that include him, Dodd registers at 1 percent. He's topped out at 2 percent about five times. Even Carol Moseley Braun polled better in 2004.
 
And anyway, does Dodd really want to be comparing himself to Kerry? Refresh our memory here, but didn't the senator from Massachusetts ultimately — what's that word again? — lose?

Marriage rates declined before same-sex unions legalized
","
In a Republican debate on Sept. 5, 2007, Brownback cited an argument that social-values conservatives have been making for years about gay marriage: that it causes declining marriage rates and more births to unmarried couples.
 
But the trends of declining marriage rates and births out of wedlock started before gay unions were legalized.
 
M.V. Lee Badgett, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the research director of the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at UCLA, wrote a detailed study that examined rates for marriage and birth rates in Scandinavian countries.
 
""Marriage rates, divorce rates, and nonmarital birth rates have been changing in Scandinavia, Europe, and the United States for the past thirty years,"" Badgett writes. ""But those changes have occurred in all countries, regardless of whether or not they adopted same-sex partnership laws, and these trends were underway well before the passage of laws that gave same-sex couples rights.""
 
In, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, same-sex partnerships were legalized in 1989, 1993 and 1994, respectively. Generally speaking, gay partners in these countries have the legal and financial protections of marriage, but they are not allowed to marry in church or adopt children.
 
The county-level statistics Brownback cites about first-born births are correct, Badgett said, but that trend also started years before the legalization of same-sex unions.
 
Conservative author Stanley Kurtz is a prominent advocate of the argument that gay marriage hurts heterosexual marriage. Kurtz responded to Badgett's study by arguing that marriage rates in Scandinavia and other European countries are still declining, and that the legalization of same-sex partnerships ""reinforces and intensifies parental cohabitation.""
 
But even Kurtz acknowledges that the decline began before the legalization of same-sex unions.

In a 1993 memo for his mayoral campaign, a Giuliani strategist noted the ""weirdness"" factor of the marriage, according to a copy posted on the Smoking Gun Web site. But such a marriage is completely legal. In New York, even first cousins can wed.
Robin Bennett, senior genetic counselor at the University of Washington, said little scientific research exists about the risk of developmental difficulties for the offspring of second cousins.

","Romney is right that McCain switched on the tax cuts.
 
When the cuts were first proposed in 2001, McCain joined Democrats in voting against them. At the time, he said the tax breaks didn't do enough for the middle class, and because of a need for increased defense spending.
 
In 2003, the phased-in cuts of 2001 were accelerated but McCain again voted no, saying taxes shouldn't be cut in time of war. But in 2006, when the cuts were extended, McCain voted yes because he said opposing the extension of cuts already in place would amount to a tax increase.

By itself, black voter increase does not flip Mississippi — or the South
","On Aug. 20, 2007, in a bid to convince New Hampshire Democrats that he stands the best chance of beating the Republican nominee next year, Obama said he could be the only candidate to ""actually redraw the political map"" — especially in the South. ""If we just got African-Americans in Mississippi to vote their percentage of the population,"" he said, ""Mississippi is suddenly a Democratic state."" He said the same would happen in Georgia, and that South Carolina would be in play as well.
 
His claims about those states don't stand up very well to the math.
 
To begin with, African-Americans in Mississippi and Georgia already come close to voting their percentage of the population. The suggested gains, while they may be welcome, would not be large enough to turn the tide in these red states.
 
In the 2004 presidential election, blacks made up 34 percent of the voters who turned out in Mississippi, where they comprise 37 percent of the population. The numbers are similar in Georgia.
In South Carolina, blacks actually made up a slightly larger portion of Election Day voters than they did of the population.
 
Still, the Democratic candidate, John Kerry, went down to defeat in those states.
 
Enter Obama, who says his African-American heritage changes the game in 2008. What if blacks did vote their percentage of the population in the states he mentions?
 
Say he gets every black Mississippi vote that Kerry got in 2004. (about 352,500). Then say he gets the Mississippi white voters who supported Kerry (105,200). Then give him all of the 72,600 black voters who would turn out if Mississippi blacks voted their percentage of the population in 2008.
 
That's about 530,300 total votes for Obama — still short of the 685,000 Mississippi votes that went to George W. Bush in 2004.
 
In sum, he falls short by more than 150,000 votes in Mississippi, about 300,000 votes in Georgia and more than 200,000 votes in South Carolina - even using the most favorable estimates.
 
We did the same analysis on the rest of the Southern states. The math works out the same everywhere but in Florida, where the margin between the parties is so close that an extra 400,000 black voters — all supporting Obama — might buy him a very narrow victory.

His numbers are right, but actual impact of fence unclear
","No, he didn't really build the fence himself, but we don't think anybody thinks that's what he meant. And he was instrumental in securing the funding to have the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers get the work done.
 
It also is true that building the first strong fence along the U.S.-Mexico border south of San Diego in the early 1990s, and strengthening it at the end of the decade, did coincide with a sharp drop in apprehension of illegal immigrants in the westernmost area of the U.S.-Mexico border. But analysts dispute to what extent these changes can be attributed to the border fence.
 
Hunter is correct that smuggling along the San Diego-Tijuana corridor dramatically decreased when the fence started to go up. Border Patrol apprehensions at the Imperial Beach station, the most secure point along the fence, dropped from 321,560 in 1993 to 19,035 in 2004, a decrease of 94 percent over the 12-year period.
 
But apprehensions along the entire San Diego County section of the border, which does not have a continuous secure fence, dropped sharply, too -- 79 percent between 1996 and 2002. Meanwhile, apprehensions in the neighboring fenceless El Centro County shot up during the same period.
 
The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of the federal government, notes that opponents of the fence say there is no way of measuring how many smugglers go through the area without being apprehended. CRS says those same critics also point to other factors, such as a doubling of the number of border patrol agents in the same period that might have deterred illegal crossings.
 
Hunter is also mostly correct about his pivotal role in the construction of both the first fence along the 14-mile stretch between San Diego and Tijuana (begun in 1990) and the subsequent strengthening of the fence. He snagged the funding for the first fence in the early 1990s, then wrote the law authorizing funding for two additional layers in 1996.

In this statement, Giuliani simply tries to say too much. His assertion that the national decline in crime ""would be fairly small"" if not for the improvements in New York just isn't true.
 
From 1993-2001 -- the time frame the Giuliani campaign uses for its crime stats -- the number of violent crimes nationwide fell by about 25 percent. If you factor out the crimes that occurred in New York during that same period, the nationwide drop would still have been 23 percent.

In fact, she made that point in the original speech, as well as in Wednesday's statement.

But she also told the VFW she didn't believe the conflict in Iraq could be solved militarily, or that U.S. troops should be policing a civil war. ""The best way of honoring their service is by beginning to bring them home,"" she said. McCain's statement does not mention that part of her speech.
 
On Aug. 22, Clinton's Senate office issued a statement saying she hasn't changed her position: ""The surge was designed to give the Iraqi government time to take steps to ensure a political solution to the situation. It has failed to do so…. It is abundantly clear that there is no military solution to the sectarian fighting in Iraq. We need to stop refereeing the war, and start getting out now.""

First, but with caveats
","Richardson's ad says that, as governor of New Mexico in 2005, he ""passed the first law in the nation giving National Guard soldiers $400,000 in life insurance."" He sets up the claim, saying: ""When a National Guard soldier would fall in combat, the family was only getting $12,000 — a national disgrace.""
 
He says 18 states followed his lead.
 
We find the claims to be mostly true, though the nitpicker in us needs to point out that no governor can ""pass"" a law without a big assist from the legislative branch. Also, the ad overstates a couple of points.
 
Let's focus on the set-up claim first.
 
At the time in question — early 2005 — the families of fallen service personnel received a $12,420 ""death gratuity"" or benefit. What the ad does not say is that they probably also received the benefit of a low-cost, government-subsidized life insurance policy covering the soldiers for up to $250,000. About 95 percent of ready reserves purchase this insurance. In fact, it's automatically deducted from their pay unless they opt out.
 
This overstatement aside, Richardson did initiate and push through legislation to pay the premiums on those policies for members of the New Mexico National Guard. The legislation does amount to ""giving"" soldiers life insurance, as the ad states.
 
After Congress upped the maximum payout to $400,000, New Mexico agreed to cover the additional premiums for that coverage.
 
The $12,420 death benefit, which many others described as disgraceful, was increased to $100,000 by Congress at the same time.
 
Later in 2005 and 2006, the 18 states mentioned in the ad did pass some form of legislation improving benefits for military personnel. Were they all following Richardson's lead as the ad suggests?
Richardson said in a February 2005 news release that 21 states had contacted his office about the insurance program. ""Many are preparing legislation based on the New Mexico model,"" he said.
Still, he is far from being a lone voice on the issue.
 
Only a few months earlier, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., was proposing a generous bump in military death benefits during his 2004 presidential run. By mid January 2005, President Bush and many members of Congress from both parties were clamoring to increase death benefits for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 
We note that Richardson first proposed paying for the premiums to his state's National Guard troops on Jan. 4, 2005. So he does appear to have been on the leading edge of the effort.

McCain did not ignore more reliable polls, he just didn't have them. There has been little, if any, national polling on eminent domain since the

Kelo

Kelo

decision found that the ruling contributed to a plunge in Americans' approval of the Supreme Court.
 
And in 2006, 12 states considered ballot initiatives on legislation limiting eminent domain power.

""Ironically, all of this comes at a time of historically low violent crime rates and historically high gun ownership rates nationally,"" Thompson wrote. He went on to cite National Rifle Association figures.
 
His statistics fall short in several ways.
 
First, gun ownership rates are extremely difficult to calculate. The NRA used 8-year-old federal estimates and then used gun purchase figures to assume there are additional guns in the United States. However, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said it is impossible to estimate how gun ownership has grown because there is no national gun registry.
 
Violent crime had been at historic lows, dropping between 1993 and 2004. However, the FBI reports that the estimated rate of violent crime increased 2.3 percent in 2005 and 1.3 percent in 2006.
 
Advocates on both sides of the issue have used the statistics to argue their own cases.
 
The neutral Congressional Research Service declared in May 2005 that there's not enough evidence on either side: ""According to a recent study...none of the existing sources of statistics provide either comprehensive, timely or accurate data with which to definitively assess whether there is a causal connection between firearms and violence.""
