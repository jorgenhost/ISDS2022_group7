North Carolina Democrat right: most Americans want Trump to wear a mask
","When North Carolina legislators returned to the Capitol, the House minority leader showed up wearing a surgical mask bearing the state flag. Health experts recommend that Americans wear face masks while in public to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, which can be transmitted through aerosol droplets. So Darren Jackson, the Democratic leader in the GOP-controlled state House, has urged his colleagues to do the same. And on May 27, Jackson offered some advice for President Donald Trump. ""Two thirds of Americans disapprove of Donald Trump not wearing a face mask in public, and the vast majority supports elected officials being required to wear masks in government buildings,"" Jackson tweeted. Is he right about the polling on Trump? Overall, yes: Polls show that most poll respondents believe the president should wear a mask, though the level of support varies by political affiliation. When we reached out to Jackson, he cited an online survey of 1,012 people by Navigator Research, a pollster that works with Democratic and progressive clients. Their poll question asked, ""Do you approve or disapprove of Donald Trump’s decision NOT to wear a face mask while in public?""  Of the group, 27% said they approve, and 65% said they disapprove. This poll was conducted using an opt-in system, with respondents volunteering to participate. However, the data was weighted for ""a variety of demographic variables"" to approximate the national registered voter population, the firm said. A look at other polls using a variety of survey methods found similar results when asking whether Trump should wear a mask in public. The Navigator poll stands out because it asked people whether they approved of Trump’s decision, while other polls asked about masks without mentioning his behavior. Still, the results were comparable. Here's what they found: Quinnipiac poll between May 14-18: 67% support Huffington Post and YouGov poll over May 14-16: 63% support Politico and Morning Consult poll between May 8-10: 70% support Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted May 13-18: 72% support The Quinnipiac and Kaiser polls used phone calls, while the HuffPost/YouGov and Politico/Morning Consult polls were online. The most obvious divergence of views comes from partisan identification. While these surveys consistently show overall support for Trump wearing a mask, Republicans are far less enthusiastic. Here’s the amount of support for the idea from Republicans in each poll: Quinnipiac: 38% support HuffPost/YouGov: 46% support (with 44% among ""Trump voters"") Politico/Morning Consult: 58% support Kaiser Family Foundation: 48% support The HuffPost/YouGov gave respondents the option to answer ""I don’t care either way,"" which was the most common answer among Republicans and Trump voters. So, among these four polls, support for Trump wearing a mask ranges between 63% and 72% among all types of voters, but it drops to between 38% and 58% among Republicans. And the Navigation Research poll found that 54% of Republicans approve of Trump’s decision not to wear a mask. Jackson said ""two-thirds of Americans disapprove of Donald Trump not wearing a face mask in public and the vast majority supports elected officials being required to wear masks in government buildings."" In each of five polls, between 63% and 72% of all respondents said Trump should wear a mask.

Trump falsely claims DC mayor kept police from White House protests
","As protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis reached the White House, President Donald Trump falsely claimed that the mayor of Washington, D.C., refused to let the district’s police support the U.S. Secret Service outside the White House and in nearby Lafayette Park. ""The D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money & help, wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved,"" Trump tweeted May 30. ""‘Not their job.’ Nice!""  ....good practice.” As you saw last night, they were very cool & very professional. Never let it get out of hand. Thank you! On the bad side, the D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money & help, wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved. “Not their job.” Nice! The attack on Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, came hours after demonstrations that began May 29.  Similar protests, focused on the long list of black men who have died from fatal run-ins with law enforcement, have continued across the country in recent days. Floyd, 46, died after a white officer kneeled on his neck for minutes following his arrest. The district’s police — the Metropolitan Police Department — were assisting the uniformed Secret Service officers during the May 29 protests, despite Trump’s claims. The Secret Service contradicted Trump roughly four hours after his tweet. In a statement on the night’s demonstrations, the agency said it made six arrests as some protesters clashed with officers and tried to knock over barriers on Pennsylvania Avenue. ""The Metropolitan Police Department and U.S. Park Police were on the scene,"" the agency said.  Secret Service statement on Pennsylvania Avenue demonstrations: pic.twitter.com/ZaTtG9iCkR Bowser held a press conference later that day. ""My police department in Washington, D.C., will always protect D.C. and all who live and visit here,"" she said, echoing comments she had made on Twitter after Trump’s attack. ""In fact, that is exactly what we did yesterday and last night."" ""No one needed to ask the Metropolitan Police Department to get involved because we were already involved,"" she continued. ""Our police were doing their jobs from the start. D.C. police supported uniformed Secret Service last night like we have done literally dozens of times at Lafayette Park.""  Bowser said the district’s police were coordinating with the Secret Service and U.S. Park Police throughout the night on May 29 and into the early morning on May 30. The night’s protests included more than 1,000 people at their peak, and a much smaller number remained in Lafayette Park until 3:45 a.m. on May 30, said district police chief Peter Newsham.  The White House and Lafayette Park, Newsham noted, are under federal jurisdiction and managed by the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. But the district police stay in communication with both agencies and often work in tandem to manage major protests. When large-scale demonstrations do take place, the district police establish a ""unified command"" with other local and federal law enforcement agencies to ""collectively make decisions on how to proceed,"" Newsham said. ""All of the decisions that are made in an instance like this (are) made in a unified command. A collective decision was made on how to proceed,"" Newsham said. ""That’s the way we handled it last night and early this morning."" The Metropolitan Police Department did not specifically station officers as part of the line of Secret Service officers guarding the White House, Newsham said, although some of the department’s leaders working with the unified command might have been behind that line.  The Metropolitan Police Department also provided Secret Service officers with equipment that they didn’t have, including helmets, Newsham said. Reporters at the scene noted a visible district police presence at the city’s protests, as well. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump said that during protests outside the White House on May 29 and into May 30, Bowser ""wouldn't let the D.C. Police get involved."" That’s wrong, and Trump offered no evidence to support the attack. The Metropolitan Police Department in Washington coordinated with the U.S. Secret Service and U.S. Park Police and also provided some equipment, including helmets. The district’s police were ""on the scene,"" the Secret Service said.

The protests over George Floyd’s death are real
","George Floyd died on May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck. He said he couldn’t breathe and cried out for his mother. Nothing supports claims social media users are sharing that say his death was staged by unseen hands to ""purge"" the United States. A sprawling June 1 Facebook post skips from Freemasonry to sacrificial death to martial law. It warns of ""the first annual purge"" prompted by a government that hired people to riot in the wake of Floyd’s death. But in the end it’s a conspiracy theory that ignores the social realities of our country.  ""George Floyd was a freemason and it’s pretty clear what to expect when a person is a freemason,"" the post begins. ""Most of the time Freemsons have a certain period of time where they can live they life to the fullest and then will come an act in which they must participate in which could be sacrifice or a faked death for publicity and an evil agenda to be fulfill WAKE UP everything you see is not REAL!

It started in medieval Europe as a guild for stonemasons and evolved into a social organization. The ""essential qualification for admission"" is ""a belief in a Supreme being,"" the Minnesota Freemasons say, and membership is open to all races and religious beliefs.  Here’s what the group has to say about secrecy: ""The secrets of Freemasonry are concerned with its traditional modes of recognition. It is not a secret society, since all members are free to acknowledge their membership and will do so in response to inquiries for respectable reasons. Its constitutions and rules are available to the public. There is no secret about its aims and principles."" We reached out to the Minnesota Freemasons. Keith Reierson, the group’s grand secretary, told us Floyd wasn’t a member of any lodge under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Minnesota. But Reierson said ""that doesn’t mean he wasn’t a Freemason."" Floyd could have been a member at a lodge under a different Minnesota jurisdiction, or he could have been a member in another state and never joined a lodge in Minnesota.  Floyd was the latest in a long line of black men who have died in police custody and outrage over his death, and racism in America, have fueled protests across the country in recent days.  The FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice are investigating Floyd’s death as a possible civil rights violation. The officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.  We rate this Facebook post False.",/factchecks/2020/jun/01/viral-image/protests-over-george-floyds-death-are-real/

Fact-checking Joe Biden’s claim that Trump delayed $8 billion in coronavirus funding for tribes
","Native American tribes have been among the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, and Joe Biden claims that President Donald Trump has not done enough to help. ""Donald Trump has failed to live up to our trust and treaty obligations to Native Americans,"" Biden told The Arizona Republic May 21. ""He took more than a month to allocate Congress’ emergency funding to tribes — and only did so after tribes sued. He has failed to provide tribes with adequate protective personal equipment and medical supplies. It’s unacceptable."" Indian treaty rights recognized and established rights, benefits, and conditions for tribes who agreed to cede millions of acres of land to the United States and to accept the United States’ protection. Under a ""trust responsibility"" legal principle, the United States federal government is obligated to ensure the survival and welfare of Indian tribes. Is Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, right that it took more than a month for tribes to get funding allocated by Congress, and that it happened only after suing the Trump administration? The chronology lines up, but omits important context. The Treasury Department has argued that payments were delayed because it is required to consult with tribes and the Interior Department regarding how much money to allocate to tribes. That consultation process started before the lawsuit over the delay in payments. A separate lawsuit filed by tribes to prevent corporations in Alaska from receiving aid has also affected the process. Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, and Trump signed it into law March 27. The $2.2 trillion measure included a $150 billion Coronavirus Relief Fund for states, local governments, and tribal governments. The law set aside $8 billion for tribal governments. The law said the Treasury secretary had to make the payments within 30 days; so by April 26, all entities were supposed to have received funds. It wasn’t until May 5 that the Treasury Department said it would begin making funds available to tribal governments. So that part of Biden’s claim adds up. By May 5, the Trump administration was facing several lawsuits by multiple tribes: for delay of payment. The lawsuits also challenged the administration for intending to direct some of the funds to the Alaska Native Corporations, which are regional and village corporations recognized under Alaska law and created by Congress as part of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. In the lawsuit to stop the corporations from getting a share of the $8 billion, tribes argued that corporations do not meet the statutory definition of ""tribal government,"" or ""Indian tribe"" and therefore did not qualify for the relief. A federal district judge on April 27 issued a preliminary injunction to prevent the Treasury from giving money to the corporations. Pending a final determination, the judge did not direct the Treasury secretary to immediately disburse the entire $8 billion to the tribes. In its May 5 announcement, the Trump administration said it would begin paying tribes 60% of the $8 billion, or $4.8 billion, based on population data. The remaining 40% would be paid at ""a later date"" based on employment data and tribe expenses related to COVID-19. Amounts calculated for corporations would be held back ""until pending litigation relating to their eligibility is resolved."" The Navajo Nation, which joined tribes in the lawsuit, on May 5 said the judge’s April 27 ruling ""led to the (Treasury) Department’s announcement to begin distributing funds to federally-recognized tribes."" In a separate lawsuit over the delay in the disbursement of funds, lawyers for the Trump administration argued that providing funds to tribal governments required a more involved and difficult process than the one for states and local governments. While the CARES Act imposed a 30-day deadline for funds disbursement, it also called for a consultation process among tribes and the Treasury and Interior departments. According to the Trump administration, Treasury staff spent about 2,200 hours on efforts to get tribes the appropriated money. The same federal district judge from the corporations case said that those hours of labor ""arguably should have produced better results,"" but a court intervention was not warranted. ""‘Egregious’ delay is the governing standard, and the Secretary is not there quite yet, even in the midst of a public health crisis,"" U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta wrote in a May 11 opinion. Mehta did not find that the Treasury secretary was ""lagging unreasonably"" behind in delivering the funds. ""The Secretary has not been ‘twiddling his thumbs’,"" he said, citing language from a precedent. Mehta said he would not give the Treasury department a deadline for disbursing the rest of the funds, but if it took the department double the amount of time Congress directed for the disbursement, ""then the question of egregiousness becomes a closer one than it is today."" Biden said Trump ""took more than a month to allocate Congress’ emergency funding to tribes — and only did so after tribes sued."" It did take more than a month for tribes to begin receiving funds appropriated by Congress, and they began to flow after lawsuits were filed against the Trump administration. But a consultation process for disbursing the funds began before the administration was sued.

NAACP gave Joe Biden some high marks but never endorsed him
","Black voters helped former Vice President Joe Biden all but secure the Democratic presidential nomination. But Biden overstated his support from the NAACP on a prominent radio show — the same one in which he said black voters who don’t support him ""ain’t black."" Biden faced tough questions during the May 22 edition of the ""Breakfast Club"" show, which has a mostly black audience. Host Charlamagne tha God told Biden that Democrats take black voters for granted and asked why Biden resisted admitting that the 1994 crime bill hurt the black community. He also asked about the message sent by his campaign vetting Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a white senator from Minnesota, as a possible running mate. Near the end of the interview, Biden said: ""You got more questions, but I tell you if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black."" Charlamagne tha God responded: ""It don't have nothing to do with Trump. It has to do with the fact I want something for my community. I would love to see --"" Biden interjected: ""Take a look at my record, man,"" citing his work to extend the Voting Rights Act. ""I have a record that is second to none. The NAACP has endorsed me every time I've run."" Later in the day, Biden walked back his ""you ain’t black"" comment. But it wasn’t the only thing that needed addressing from the interview. NAACP CEO Derrick Johnson said contrary to Biden’s claim, the civil rights organization does not endorse candidates. ""We want to clarify that the NAACP is a nonpartisan organization and does not endorse candidates for political office at any level,"" Johnson wrote May 22. ""Persons affiliated with the NAACP at the national, state, and local levels are free to make candidate endorsements in a personal capacity, but they do not reflect support by the NAACP as an organization."" The NAACP’s tax-exempt status means that it cannot endorse political candidates. RELATED: US minorities surpassed 25 percent of electorate when Obama ran in 2008, and it's going up The Biden campaign told PolitiFact that Biden was referring to NAACP ratings. Like other groups around politics, the NAACP issues a legislative report card for members of Congress rating their positions on bills pertaining to civil rights and other priorities for the organization.  Each report card rates members on how they voted on judicial confirmations and specific bills that cover a range of topics such as education funding, job training, gun regulations, Medicaid and Medicare, voting and civil rights. The report cards available online date back to the 1989-90 term in Congress.  Biden received several ratings during his decades-long career as a U.S. senator. Most were high. Biden’s most recent report cards are from at least 15 years ago. In 2005-06 and 2003-04, he received a 100%. The link on the NAACP’s website for the 2001-02 report card was broken.  In the 1990s, he received grades of 90% or higher  three times and received one 80%, one 70% and one 60%. In the earlier years, the report cards often reflected members’ votes on about 10 issues while in later years it covered around 30 votes. That means that the more recent report cards provide more information on members’ voting records. Thirty-six years ago, the Biden campaign pointed out, the Wilmington News Journal wrote that while the NAACP doesn’t endorse, its materials show who they support. The newspaper described a voter education bulletin distributed in October 1984 by the Delaware State Conference of Branches of the NAACP. The bulletin ""makes clear that the NAACP backs two Democratic incumbents, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Rep. Thomas R. Carper, as well as Republican Battle R. Robinson for lieutenant governor,"" the News Journal wrote. The group’s voter information guide stated that Biden received a 90%. RELATED: Donald Trump said he's done more for African Americans than any president. Historians disagree Biden said, ""The NAACP has endorsed me every time I've run."" The NAACP does not endorse candidates. Biden’s campaign said he was referring to past ratings by the NAACP when Biden was a U.S. senator. The civil rights organization gave him a grade of 90% or higher five times, though on three occasions in the 1990s he earned a lower score. Those grades show that Biden’s record generally aligned with the NAACP’s priorities for most of his tenure in the Senate. But it’s not the same as an endorsement in a campaign.

No, George Soros and his foundations do not pay people to protest
","Billionaire philanthropist George Soros has been accused for years of directly funding and even orchestrating protests.  This includes false claims that Soros financially supported the first national Women’s March and organized the Charlottesville, Va., protests and counter-protests in 2017.  In a series of tweets, Candace Owens, a conservative commentator, claimed that George Soros and his Open Society Foundations had hired the protesters that started fires and raided stores during protests in Minneapolis over the death of George Floyd.   The Minneapolis chief of police just confirmed that many of the protesters that are burning down the city are NOT FROM MINNEAPOLIS. My guess: As he did with Antifa, Democrat George Soros has these thugs on payroll. He is funding the chaos via his Open Society Foundation. pic.twitter.com/ZWDQfLUjfa She at first tweeted that it was her ""guess"" that ""Democrat George Soros has these thugs on payroll. He is funding the chaos via his Open Society Foundation."" She went on to tweet that the foundation had to ""throw money at black Americans to riot"" and that Soros and the foundation ""got what you wanted in Minnesota."" We reached out to Owens for additional comment and did not hear back.  Open Society Foundations is a liberal grant-making network that is ""the world’s largest private funder of independent groups working for justice, democratic governance, and human rights."" Their network funds programs in more than 120 countries, including work in the United States that ""focuses on immigration and criminal justice reform, improving democratic participation, and supporting free and independent media."" The Open Society Foundations’ official Twitter account responded to her tweet that they ""oppose all violence and do not pay people to protest"" and that these were ""baseless allegations.""   Hi Candace, Mr. Soros and the Open Society Foundations oppose all violence and do not pay people to protest. We lament the effort, through baseless allegations, to distract from the crisis of police brutality in Minneapolis and in too many other parts of the country. An Open Society Foundations representative told PolitiFact that the foundation ""supports the First Amendment right of all Americans to make their voices heard and petition their government for redress of grievances."" However, when it comes to rioting, ""George Soros and the foundations oppose violence in any and all forms,"" they said. The foundation does give grants every one or two years to U.S. organizations that work to ""advance racial justice and to make police forces more accountable to the communities they serve."" They then listed a few, including the Community Resource Hub for Safety and Accountability, a website that keeps a database of resources and grassroot organizations related to policing in the United States.  PolitiFact could find no evidence that Soros or the Open Society Foundations had contributed to any organization that financed street protests in Minneapolis. Owens also claimed that the Open Society Foundations gave $33 million to the Black Lives Matter movement.  The claim that George Soros funded the Ferguson protests and Black Lives Matter was checked by Snopes in 2015, and it received a mixed rating. Snopes said that Open Society Foundations has donated $33 million to organizations that have worked with Black Lives Matter or worked to raise awareness during the Ferguson-related protests. However, they had never given money to groups for the express purpose of organizing protests with the movement.  The representative from Open Society Foundations said that their grants are made to organizations to help them ""support communities and advance policy change."" We didn’t find any evidence that the foundation has given money directly to the Black Lives Matter movement. The most recent connection they have with the organization is their 2018 grant of $279,860 to Release Leads, a UK organization that mostly focuses on international drug use education and policy reform, but also organizes public speaking events that feature the Black Lives Matter movement in the UK. Our ruling Owens’ tweet that Soros was ""funding the chaos"" in Minneapolis through Open Society Foundations is unproven.

NC governor mostly right about indoor worship and coronavirus
","North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper eased pandemic restrictions on retail stores before doing so for churches -- a move that prompted pushback from some members of the faith community. Non-essential stores and indoor church services were both initially forbidden to operate under Cooper’s stay-at-home order. When Cooper launched Phase One of reopening North Carolina, he allowed some stores to open but didn’t allow churches to hold services indoors. Experts generally agree that traditional church customs such as singing, passing around bulletins and even sharing food would make worship services especially dangerous during the coronavirus outbreak. But Cooper’s critics argued for a chance to worship while being responsible. During a press conference on May 12, Cooper said his decision was based on science. ""We know that inside it is much more likely that you’re going to transmit this virus, particularly when you’re sitting or standing in one place for a long period of time, and this is across the board. And some people are trying to compare this with retail. With retail, people are moving around and you don’t have as much a chance to spread the virus (as you do) when people are sitting or standing indoors."" Since then, a judge’s ruling has enabled indoor church services in North Carolina. A US District Court Judge allowed for a restraining order on Cooper’s rules, and Cooper said he won’t appeal. Still, we wondered which is more dangerous: sitting in a building with the same group of people for a prolonged period, or walking around a building with an ever-changing group of people? The answer isn’t simple. Is it possible that a church could practice social distancing well enough to prevent virus spread? Yes. Is it also possible that one shopper could linger too long around another shopper who’s infected? Also yes.  Because of those variables, the country’s top health organizations told us they haven’t compared the two environments enough to say whether one is more dangerous than another.  However, experts do believe that sitting in one place for a long time does pose a threat -- while shopping usually allows people the physical freedom to avoid someone who might be infected. For this fact check, we reached out to the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is directed by Dr. Anthony Fauci. None of the groups offered specifics on which scenario is more dangerous. The WHO doesn’t categorize activities by risk because each scenario ""depends on a range of factors, from the local transmission scenario that is occurring, to prevention measures adopted by individuals to the IPC procedures in place in these public spaces,"" said Ashley Baldwin, a regional spokeswoman. Fauci’s group responded similarly: ""I’m not aware that this is anything our researchers have explored,"" NIAID spokesman Ken Pekoc said. The CDC hasn’t compared them either, CDC spokeswoman Kate Grusich said. ""CDC has not compared locations or settings for COVID-19 transmission, so we can’t comment on these questions at this time,"" she said. But the CDC does emphasize the risk of time spent around other people in close proximity.  Kelly Haight Connor, communications manager for North Carolina’s health department, responded to PolitiFact questions on Cooper’s behalf. She pointed out several instances where the CDC warns against large gatherings of people.  The CDC’s webpage on social distancing says ""COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period."" The CDC, which acknowledges the ""risk of gatherings,"" also offers guidance for churches hoping to hold services during the pandemic. Recommendations include: scheduling multiple services, with enough time between each to allow for cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces, promoting social distancing, limiting the sharing of materials, considering holding services and gatherings in a large, well-ventilated area or outdoors. The novel coronavirus travels through respiratory droplets expelled when someone coughs, sneezes or talks. Without definitive studies comparing the likelihood of spread in two environments, we turned to experts for their opinion.  Karen Hoffmann, the immediate past president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, told PolitiFact that the ability to walk away from someone is key. And if you do pass someone in an aisle at Target, experts believe you’re less at risk than someone sitting still in a confined space. ""I would not worry about walking by someone,"" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University, told Slate.  ""Even in a health care setting, contact is defined by being near someone for a certain amount of time,"" Adalja said. ""I would not worry about these fleeting encounters. The virus isn’t airborne—droplets need to get from one person to another."" Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, told us she generally agrees. ""Reports from indoor spaces (restaurants, offices) suggest that both physical proximity and duration of exposure are important for transmission,"" Rasmussen said in an email. ""So sitting still around others in close physical proximity is probably higher risk than incidentally passing by someone in a store, but the risks aren’t quantified because there are a lot of variables that can impact this."" A recent NPR article categorized 14 different activities by their level of risk for infection. Worship services? ""High risk."" Going shopping? ""Risk varies."" ""Crowds with high density lead to substantial increase in risk,"" said Dr. William Miller, an epidemiologist at Ohio State University. ""The major mitigating factor is that people don't mingle in a single place for long."" While churches may be able to mitigate coronavirus spread, there are multiple examples of churches failing to take precautions -- and thus becoming the source of small outbreaks. A church revival in Hopkins County, Kentucky was linked to at least 30 cases and three deaths, according to The Courier Journal. Officials in California connected 71 cases to one church in a suburb of Sacramento, The Guardian reported. The Washington Post recently listed several examples in a story about the dangers of worship during the pandemic. On its Facebook page, the CDC on May 19 used a rural Arkansas church as an example of how fast coronavirus can spread in group settings. The CDC reported that two people with coronavirus symptoms attended the church in early March.  ""Of the 92 church members who attended the gatherings, 35 were later confirmed to have COVID-19, which led to three deaths. Through contact tracing, an additional 26 confirmed cases were identified in the community,"" the CDC’s Facebook post says. ""This outbreak highlights the potential for widespread transmission of COVID-19 during in-person, faith-based events."" The CDC posted a report on the Arkansas outbreak on its website. Cooper said shopping isn’t as likely to spread coronavirus as church services because ""people are moving around and you don’t have as much a chance to spread the virus (as you do) when people are sitting or standing indoors."" The world’s leading health organizations have not offered a risk comparison between shopping and attending a worship service in part because there are so many variables.  However, generally speaking, experts are definitely less worried about spaces where people can move freely than they are about spaces where people sit near each other for long periods of time.

Trump administration provides food aid during pandemic, while quietly trying to impose limits
","Congress and the Trump administration have approved about $3 trillion in coronavirus relief in four separate measures over the last two months, including extra unemployment benefits, aid to hospitals and loans aimed at small businesses.  So, this May 15, 2020 tweet from U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, caught our attention: ""The Trump Administration is trying to take food assistance away from Wisconsin families when people are out of work and struggling.""  Is she right? When asked to back up the claim, a Baldwin staffer pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a lawsuit involving the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the nation’s food assistance programs, including SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The USDA released a proposed rule Feb. 1, 2019, that would make it harder for states to waive work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents. In March of that year, 47 Republican and Democratic Senators urged the Administration to withdraw the rule. But on Dec. 4, 2019, the Administration released the final rule. The rule change was set to take effect April 1, 2020. Prior to the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the rule was expected to cut off basic food assistance for nearly 700,000 people. However, a coalition of states filed a lawsuit to challenge the rule change.  A federal judge issued an injunction March 13, 2020, to temporarily block implementation of the rule change.  ""As a global pandemic poses widespread health risks, guaranteeing that government officials at both the federal and state levels have flexibility to address the nutritional needs of residents and ensure their well-being through programs like SNAP, is essential,"" Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., wrote in her March 13, 2020 opinion. So that puts things on hold. And the Families First Coronavirus Response Act -- one of the measures passed by Congress amid the pandemic -- waived the work requirement for able-bodied adults without dependents for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency. So, how is Trump trying to ""take food assistance away from Wisconsin families""? The view from Baldwin’s staff: ""The USDA is continuing to defend the rule change and filed a notice earlier this month that it is appealing the temporary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.""  In a May 13, 2020 article from  TIME magazine, U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, chair of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight and Department Operations, labeled the USDA’s effort to continue the case a ""cruel pursuit of unrealistic policy."" So, while the lawsuit is on hold and work requirements are temporarily suspended, the administration is continuing to pursue the case. If ultimately successful, the change could then remove nearly 700,000 people from the SNAP program. The USDA pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to an April 22, 2020 news release from the agency that noted there had been a 40% increase in monthly SNAP benefits amid the pandemic.  ""Ensuring all households receive the maximum allowable SNAP benefit is an important part of President Trump’s whole of America response to the coronavirus,"" U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said in the statement. The agency cited other food assistance initiatives, including distribution of millions of pounds of food in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The agency did not address the rule change in its email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, but in a May 13, 2020 Reuters article, the agency said it has been ""extremely aggressive"" to ensure food needs are met during the pandemic.  ""While we’re currently in a very challenging environment, we do not expect this to last forever,"" the agency said, adding ""we must prepare our workforce to rejoin the economy when our nation reopens.""  So, in effect, the administration is doubling down on its position as it relates to the lawsuit. Baldwin said ""the Trump Administration is trying to take food assistance away from Wisconsin families when people are out of work and struggling.""  Congress and the Trump administration have launched various assistance initiatives during the pandemic. And one measure specifically lifted a work-related requirement.  However, at the same time, the administration doubled down on its support of a proposed SNAP rule change that would in effect cut off basic food assistance for nearly 700,000 people -- once an emergency is lifted, and if the agency successfully fends off a lawsuit.  We rate the claim Half True.

No, the World Health Organization didn't ‘miss’ the coronavirus pandemic
","Speaking on the ""Fox Across America"" radio show, U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick accused global health officials of failing earlier this year to warn the world about the coming coronavirus pandemic.  ""For the World Health Organization, the international entity whose sole responsibility it is to alert the world of global pandemics, to miss this, is a huge problem,"" Fitzpatrick, a Republican, told radio host Jimmy Failla.  We wondered whether Fitzpatrick’s stinging criticism was fair and what exactly the WHO told the public about the coronavirus in the pandemic’s earliest days.  Fitzpatrick was referring to a Jan. 14 tweet from the WHO, which stated that ""preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China."" A timeline of events on the WHO’s website about its actions on Jan. 14 offers a different account of what the organization told the public that day, indicating deeper concern than what was reflected in the tweet. The timeline states that on that date, a WHO official noted in a press briefing that there ""may have been"" limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus between family members and that there was ""a risk of a possible outbreak.""  Nearly a week later, according to the timeline, WHO investigators visited Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus originated, and learned that there was evidence of human-to-human transmission, a major development that contradicted the Chinese government claims cited in the organization’s Jan. 14 tweet.  Another week after that, the WHO’s director-general declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" a rare designation meant to convey the extraordinary and serious nature of an unfolding health crisis.  On March 11, the WHO gave the coronavirus another ominous designation – global pandemic.  Will Kiley, a spokesman for Fitzpatrick, said the two-month delay between the Jan. 14 tweet and the pandemic declaration justifies the congressman’s criticism, especially given evidence the virus had spread beyond China as early as Jan. 20.   The Jan. 14 tweet accurately reflects what Chinese officials told the WHO at the time – that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission. But the group should have questioned the accuracy of China’s claim before issuing the tweet, said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. He and other infectious-disease experts did.  ""We didn’t believe them,"" Adalja said. ""It was clear to many who looked at the data that this virus wasn’t containable."" A PolitiFact story on the WHO’s response to the pandemic written after President Donald Trump announced the United States would halt its financial support for the group found no credible evidence of human-to-human transmission prior to mid-January.  ""There were questions, but no solid confirmation,"" Boston University global health researcher Davidson Hamer told PolitiFact in April.  But by Jan. 20, there had already been 200 cases, three deaths and three countries impacted, Adalja noted in a Jan. 20 blog post on the coronavirus, citing a paper published a day earlier by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. It was not until Jan. 22 that the WHO acknowledged for the first time that there had been human-to-human transmission.  Adalja added that the WHO was slow to declare the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern, and very slow issuing the pandemic declaration. Still, he said, accusing the WHO of missing the pandemic altogether goes too far.  ""When it comes to these declarations, there’s a lot of politics and diplomacy at play,"" Adalja said.  Michael LeVasseur, an epidemiologist at Drexel University, also said he does not think the WHO missed the pandemic.  ""I don’t think anything was missed,"" LeVasseur said. ""Missed implies that they weren’t involved very early on, which they were."" Fitzpatrick also claimed that alerting the world to global pandemics is the WHO’s ""sole responsibility."" But the group actually has a much broader mission to promote public health in parts of the world with limited access to health care.  During a conservative talk radio interview, Fitzpatrick accused the WHO of missing the pandemic, citing a Jan. 14 tweet in which the organization reported Chinese assurances that  there was no human-to-human transmission of the virus.  Experts argue that the WHO was slow to acknowledge human-to-human transmission, declare the coronavirus a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" and label it a pandemic.  But the agency was actively gathering and disseminating information about the virus in the weeks prior to the official pandemic declaration, and it’s possible to interpret public statements made during this time as cautious, not reckless. Saying the WHO missed the pandemic altogether goes too far. Also, Fitzpatrick’s claim doesn’t acknowledge the WHO’s work promoting public health. For these reasons, we rate Fitzpatrick’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/may/30/brian-fitzpatrick/no-world-health-organization-didnt-miss-coronaviru/

Early findings show fabric can neutralize coronaviruses
","Editor's note: This story has been updated to clarify the development of this type of fabric dates back to 2005, when it was patented by Jeffry Skiba and Lawrence Schneider. There’s reason to be skeptical of any Internet post claiming something kills the coronavirus. Facebook in particular can be a deluge of home remedies that range from unproven to downright dangerous. So you’d be forgiven for raising your eyebrows if you came across a May 21, 2020, Indianapolis Monthly article shared widely on Facebook saying researchers have found a ""fabric that kills coronaviruses."" But this claim has science behind it — preliminary though it may be. Researchers discovered low-level electric fields can render the coronavirus unable to infect a host after just a minute of exposure to the field. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Here’s what we know so far about this product. Though the application to the novel coronavirus is new, the technology isn’t. The concept — called electroceutical fabric — was developed more than a decade ago, patented in 2005 by Jeffry Skiba and Lawrence Schneider. Itis  approved by the FDA as a wound dressing and sold by Vomaris under the name Procellera. Chandan Sen, now the director of the Indiana Center for Regenerative Medicine and Engineering at the Indiana University School of Medicine, conducted a study in 2017 demonstrating the fabric's effectiveness as an antimicrobial wound dressing. And now he is applying the technology to combat COVID-19, with encouraging early results. When the coronavirus pandemic began, Sen thought about ways his research could help, he said in a YouTube video released through Indiana University. ""We tried to put some time into understanding the physical make of this virus, and are there perhaps some weak points we could target,"" Sen said. Sen detailed the potential application to COVID-19 on May 14, 2020, in a preliminary study released online at the preprint server ChemRxiv. The site publishes early versions of studies ahead of formal peer review and publication. Coronaviruses in general rely on electrostatic interactions to assemble themselves into an infective form and attach to a host. The electroceutical fabric consists of polyester printed with a series of metal dots — alternating silver and zinc — printed on the fabric in a geometric pattern. There is no wire or external battery, but these metals when exposed to moisture create microcell batteries that generate an electrical charge. ""We thought then our dressing (could be) capable of disrupting those electrostatic forces, and we started testing it and the results have seemed very promising,"" Sen said in the video. ""You’re using a very weak electric field which is not harmful to humans … but is capable of dismantling bacterial infections, we are currently working on fungal infection, and now we see it can also incapacitate, if you will, viruses."" Vomaris has applied through the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization program to use the fabric for COVID-19 face masks. The Indianapolis Star reported May 26, 2020, the company is hoping to use the fabric to develop two products: A washable mask with a disposable electroceutical fabric layer can be inserted, and another mask designed for one-time use. The company hopes to have the products on the market by the fall flu season. ""Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential to safeguard healthcare providers against COVID-19,"" Sen’s study says. ""However, use of these PPE itself poses significant threat as doffing of contaminated PPE carrying viable viral particles is likely to infect the person and potentially spread infection."" An article spread widely on Facebook says researchers have discovered a ""fabric that kills coronaviruses"" This particular application has not yet been peer-reviewed or approved by the FDA, but initial research shows electroceutical fabric is indeed able to neutralize the virus after a minute of contact with the electrical field generated by the fabric. The company that already manufacturers this product for use as a wound dressing hopes to have it ready for release later this year in antiviral face masks. So the signs are good, but given these findings are preliminary and haven’t yet been subject to peer review, we rate this Mostly True.",/factchecks/2020/may/30/facebook-posts/research-fabric-can-neutralize-coronavirus-masks/

The couple own a vacation home in the Traverse City region.  But Whitmer’s spokeswoman, Tiffany Brown, said there was no family graduation party held in the Traverse City area over the weekend of May 23-24 and that the governor was not in the area.  There is some evidence that Mallory could have been at the couple’s vacation home in Elk Rapids, 17 miles northeast of Traverse City, on May 20, the date of the Facebook post.

Michelle Malkin says Gloria Steinem once called Kay Bailey Hutchison a ‘female impersonator’
","As right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh took flak for terming law student Sandra Fluke a ""slut"" over her claim that contraceptives can cost $3,000 a year, another pundit argued that conservative women are frequently targets of liberal vitriol.

Syndicated writer and Fox News contributor Michelle Malkin listed such epithets in her March 7, 2012 column, including a Texas example: ""It was feminist godmother Gloria Steinem who called Texas Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison a ‘female impersonator.’ ""

Did women’s rights icon Steinem really belittle the femininity of Texas’ first female U.S. senator?

Yes. The comment made national news in 1993 as Hutchison, then state treasurer, ran for U.S. Senate in a special election runoff against interim Democratic appointee Bob Krueger. Hutchison won the seat and has held it ever since; she is expected to retire from Congress in January 2013.

USA Today, Time and NPR all ran 1993 news stories or opinion pieces describing gender-based attacks on Hutchison that included the ""female impersonator"" comment from Steinem.

A June 25, 1993, opinion column in the Orange County Register gives this fuller version of the quotation: ""a female impersonator … someone who looks like us but thinks like them.""

The longer quotation helped us pin down a probable date for Steinem’s remark, and Dallas Morning News senior political writer Wayne Slater searched his paper’s archives and sent us a May 23, 1993, news story that reads, in part: ""Ms. Steinem, the founder of Ms. magazine, attacked Ms. Hutchison's stands on abortion and family-leave policies during a visit Friday in Dallas on behalf of Mr. Krueger. Ms. Steinem called Ms. Hutchison ‘a female impersonator.' ""

A May 22, 1993, Austin American-Statesman news story gives context for the ""impersonator"" remark: ""Steinem said she was endorsing Krueger because of his support for abortion rights. She said Hutchison ‘has vacillated between a pro-choice and an anti-choice position for the last three years, after having been solidly anti-choice for 20 years.’

""Hutchison has said she favors abortion rights but would allow states to impose some restrictions, such as requiring minors to get parental consent.""

National news outlets picked up on the irony of a feminist saying that a female politician’s views disqualified her from being a real woman. Time magazine used the quotation to start its June 14, 1993, story on Hutchison’s win:

""Gloria Steinem flew to Texas all the way from New York City to call Senate candidate Kay Bailey Hutchison a ‘female impersonator.’ Actress Annie Potts of ‘Designing Women’ pooh-poohed the Republican's vague stance on abortion rights, saying, ‘She's just the same old thing in a skirt.’ Columnist Molly Ivins hung the epithet ‘Breck girl’ on her, comparing the way the candidate tossed her blond hair to the slow-motion antics of models in the shampoo commercial. But Hutchison, the Texas state treasurer, survived those and many other attacks.""

For decades, Steinem has used the term ""female impersonator"" to describe women, including herself, who she said stopped being authentically female as they fit themselves into patriarchal society. She reportedly quipped in 1973, about men dressing as women, ""I don’t mind drag -- women have been female impersonators for years."" In a December 10, 1989, Los Angeles Times feature story, she said, ""I was trained to be a female impersonator, to giggle and laugh, and to say, 'How clever of you to know what time it is.' "" In her 1992 book, ""Revolution From Within,"" she used the term to describe pre-teen girls forced into false role-playing as they move into adolescence.

Malkin cited Steinem’s use of the term against Hutchison to rebut claims that attacks on conservative women come from extremists or entertainers rather than mainstream liberals. Malkin also pointed to comments from a National Organization for Women leader, MSNBC TV hosts and an Al Gore political consultant, among others.

Our ruling

Steinem referred to Hutchison as a female impersonator. Malkin’s statement rates True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/29/michelle-malkin/gloria-steinem-once-called-kay-bailey-hutchison-fe/

Bill Pascrell claims Steve Rothman voted against funding for auto bailout and would have let automakers go bankrupt
","
One of the defining achievements of President Barack Obama’s re-election bid, the federal assistance given to U.S. automakers, is dividing two fellow Democrats mired in their own political battle in northern New Jersey.

The campaign of U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell charges that U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman opposed funding for Obama’s auto bailout, and would have let the industry slide into bankruptcy. The two congressmen are preparing to face off June 5 for the Democratic nomination in the 9th Congressional District.

""Rothman voted AGAINST funding for President Obama's auto industry rescue package,"" Justin Myers, Pascrell’s campaign manager, said in a March 19 news release, ""The same guy who touts backing President Obama’s campaign did not even support singularly one of the most important policies that helped turn the economy from the brink of disaster. Just like Mitt Romney, Rothman would have ‘Let Detroit Go Bankrupt’.""

It’s accurate that Rothman voted against the funding mechanism that would later support the auto bailout, but the Pascrell campaign went too far in suggesting that Rothman did not support assisting U.S. automakers at all, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

First, let’s explain the funding behind the auto bailout.

The federal assistance provided to U.S. automakers came from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, created in October 2008 amid the ongoing financial crisis. Pascrell voted for the bill creating TARP, and Rothman voted against it.

TARP was originally designed to assist the nation’s financial institutions, but the administration of President George W. Bush later agreed in December 2008 to use TARP funds for the distressed automakers. That policy continued under Obama.

So, Rothman voted against the funding that ultimately went toward the auto bailout.

But two points undercut the Pascrell campaign’s argument that ""Rothman would have ‘Let Detroit Go Bankrupt’.""

First, when Rothman voted against the bill creating TARP, the money was intended to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions -- not bail out automakers. According to a September 2009 report by the Congressional Oversight Panel, ""Members of Congress who debated this legislation in late 2008 believed they were debating a bill aimed at banks and the financial sector.""

That’s why it is wrong to interpret Rothman’s no vote as a vote against helping the auto industry.

Paul Swibinski, a consultant to Rothman’s campaign, pointed to the original purpose of TARP to show that Myers’ statement is inaccurate.

""The TARP bill Steve opposed clearly stated that the purpose of the bill was to purchase troubled assets of ‘financial institutions’ – it made no mention of the auto industry or any manufacturing,"" Swibinski said in an e-mail. ""Steve had no idea that Bush would use a portion of the money for Detroit.""

About two months after TARP was created, Rothman voted for legislation designed to provide $14 billion in loans to the auto companies. That legislation was blocked in the U.S. Senate, leading the Bush administration to use TARP funds for the auto industry.

By supporting that legislation, Rothman indicated his support for some form of federal assistance for U.S. automakers.

But Pascrell spokesman Sean Darcy maintained that Rothman was not interested in providing money to rescue the auto industry.

""The fact is that he voted against TARP and that money was used to save the auto industry,"" Darcy said in an e-mail. ""So it is not ‘wrong’ to suggest that Rothman would have let Detroit go bankrupt if he got his way.""

Our ruling

In a news release, the Pascrell campaign argued that Rothman ""voted AGAINST funding for President Obama's auto industry rescue package"" and ""would have ‘Let Detroit Go Bankrupt’.""

It is true that Rothman voted against the bill creating TARP, which was later used to fund the auto bailout. But at the time of that vote, the program was not intended to assist the auto companies.

Also, Rothman indicated a willingness to provide federal assistance for automakers through his support of a separate rescue package that was later blocked in the Senate.

Pat Boone claims Medicare will be bankrupt in nine years
","
The 60 Plus Association, an advocacy group that bills itself as ""the conservative alternative"" to the AARP, has a fondness for golden oldies.

The group hired singer Pat Boone as its pitchman in an ad that targets the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, the health reform bill often called Obamacare approved by Congress in 2010.

In the ad, Boone warns seniors of potential dangers in the bill and urges them to call Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Look-alike versions aired in other states target four other Democratic senators.
PolitiFact already has run several of Boone’s claims in the ad through the Truth-O-Meter.

A statement that an independent payment advisory board created by the health care act ""can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments"" was rated Pants on Fire, as was the claim that the IPAB is ""like a Medicare IRS with the power to cut Medicare in order to pay for new government programs."" And the statement that the health care law ""will cut $500 billion from Medicare"" was rated Mostly False.

That leaves us with another alarming assertion: ""Medicare will be bankrupt in nine years, but Washington politicians, like Sherrod Brown, are ignoring the problem, putting their own re-elections first.""

The second part of the statement is subjective political rhetoric that we can't rate.

We can, however, examine the foundation of the claim about Medicare going bankrupt.

PolitiFact Ohio won’t try to predict the future. But the claim about Medicare going bankrupt isn’t a predictions as a result of an ideological debate. Rather, it’s rooted in research and projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

60 Plus cited two reports from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office when we asked about the claim.

The CBO's ""March 2011 Medicare Baseline,"" 60 Plus said, ""estimated that the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would be exhausted in 2021."" Another CBO report, the ""Budget and Economic Outlook"" for fiscal 2012 to 2022,"" estimated that the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would be exhausted by early 2022,"" it said.

That's true -- and it's not what Boone says in the ad.

The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to which the reports refer is one of two separate trust funds run by the federal government for Medicare.

This trust fund, which collects most of its money from federal payroll taxes, pays for one of four parts of Medicare, Part A, which covers inpatient hospital care, home health care, and services at skilled nursing facilities and hospices.

The other trust fund is the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. It is mostly covered by the federal government’s general fund and premiums and pays bills for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient costs, and Part D, which covers prescription drugs.

Medicare Advantage, or Part C, gives recipients the option to receive care through private insurers. It doesn’t have a trust fund.

The Supplementary Medical Insurance fund is in good shape. It is ""projected to remain in financial balance for all future years,"" according to a 2011 report by the fund’s trustees.

The Hospital Insurance fund does have big problems, but that's not the same thing as being ""bankrupt,""  a legal term of art that doesn’t apply to federal governmental programs.

A report by the Congressional Research Service leaves open the question of what would happen if the Hospital Insurance fund were to run out of money.

""There are no provisions in the Social Security Act governing what would happen in such an event,"" the report says. ""There is no authority in law for a general revenue funding of the shortfall. The fund would continue to have payroll taxes credited to it though these would be insufficient to pay all the pending claims.""

But the CRS report also notes that the Hospital Insurance trust fund has faced a projected shortfall ""almost from its inception.""

In 1970, when the program was only four years old, the insolvency date was 1972. For the next 16 years, trustees expected the fund to be exhausted by the 1990s.

Congress repeatedly changed legislation to lower fund spending and keep it from going dry. (""Baseline"" projections are made with the assumption that current laws and formulas remain unchanged.)

Our colleagues at FactCheck.org wrote in 2009 about a TV ad for another conservative group, Americans for Prosperity, which predicted Medicare would be bankrupt in eight years --  5 1/2 years from now. They checked a nearly identical claim of bankruptcy by Rep. Paul Ryan a year ago.

In both cases, FactCheck said, the claim ""goes too far.""

Again, we won’t try to predict the future. But for this claim, we don’t have to.

60 Plus cited reports showing that Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund faces insolvency in nine years. And while it’s worth noting that Congress has always pulled the fund from the brink of insolvency, and that insolvency has been forecast almost from the program’s start, that’s an event in the future that we won’t try to predict.

What we do know from research that 60 Plus cited is that that Boone’s claim -- that Medicare will be bankrupt in nine years -- takes a projection for one trust fund and applies it to all of Medicare.

By doing so, Boone’s claim overstates what the CBO reports forecast. 
The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund supports just one of the four parts of Medicare. The portions of Medicare that cover regular doctor visits and prescriptions are covered by a different trust fund that trustees say is in good shape.

Leader of education committee claims lottery deficits may exhaust reserves in a few years
","
It’s been one of the most controversial issues in this year’s session of the Tennessee legislature: a bill by Republican legislators to raise eligibility requirements for the full $4,000-a-year basic Hope Scholarship funded by the state’s lottery.

Since the program began in 2004, Tennessee high school graduates have qualified by achieving either a minimum 3.0 high school grade-point average or a minimum 21 ACT composite score. The bill as originally proposed would require students to achieve both standards to qualify for the full $4,000 annual grant at four-year schools, starting in the fall of 2015. Those who achieve one of the two standards, but not both, would still receive $2,000 a year, which they could use at four-year universities or two-year community colleges.

State Sen. Dolores Gresham, R-Somerville, the chairman of the Senate Education Committee, has massaged the bill several times. The bill is still working its way through the legislature, but the most recent version contains a ""trigger"" provision that puts the new standards into place with freshmen entering college in the fall of 2015 if lottery proceeds for the Hope Scholarship program don’t increase by at least $10 million this year and continue increasing each year through fiscal year 2014. If lottery proceeds don’t increase accordingly, the new standards for the scholarships go into effect.

The most oft-stated reason for the bill by Gresham and House sponsor Harry Brooks, R-Knoxville, is to close a deficit between the annual costs of the scholarship program and the proceeds earmarked for it from the Tennessee Lottery. The annual operating deficits do exist, but on Feb. 29, when pressed by reporters citing improving lottery revenues, Gresham took it one step further and warned that the lottery reserve fund could not withstand deficits for very long: ""Right now we have sufficient reserves to take care of Tennessee's lottery scholarship students for a few years more.""

So is Gresham’s claim true? Are yearly deficits so severe the lottery reserve fund could soon run out of money?

First, let’s consider the reserve fund.

Built up in the early years of the Tennessee Lottery as the scholarship program was being phased in, the state’s education lottery reserve fund balance totaled $393.7 million as of Dec. 31, 2011, the last accounting available from the state Department of Finance and Administration. That figure includes about $31 million that is the  current fair market value of investments in the fund whose income won’t be realized until the investments are sold, so state budget planners back that out of the total and report, for accounting purposes, an adjusted reserve fund balance at about $362.7 million.

Concern first arose over deficits in the annual operations of the scholarship program in 2009, when the financial collapse and recession coincided with a 2008 expansion of the scholarship program and the use of $24 million in lottery proceeds on the state’s pre-kindergarten program. That pushed total spending in scholarship, pre-K and some administrative costs in Fiscal Year 2008-09 to $294.8 million, when the lottery’s proceeds for those purposes totaled $285.5 million. To close the books on that year, the state dipped into the Lottery for Education reserve fund for the first time, by about $9.3 million. The annual deficit dropped to $5.7 million the following year, and was $8 million in the fiscal year that ended last June 30, according to Tennessee Higher Education Commission figures*.

What about projected operating deficits? Last fall, the Tennessee Higher Education Commission made projections for the Senate’s Lottery Stabilization Task Force that showed the largest annual operating deficits  would be for this year, about $29 million, and next year, about $25 million. That sharp rise is mostly related to the 2011 act allowing the scholarships to be used for summer college classes, starting this summer. The THEC projections then showed deficits dropping after 2013, mainly because that’s when a new cap is fully phased in that cuts off scholarship grants after a student has achieved 120 semester hours. Still, even by last fall’s THEC projections, the state’s lottery reserve fund could adequately sustain the program well into the 2020s.

But recent rosy lottery figures indicate that actual operating deficits will be smaller than those THEC projections. Lottery President and CEO Rebecca Hargrove presented new figures on Feb. 29 showing record sales and education proceeds, and she predicted that lottery proceeds for the scholarship program will be up at least $10 million this year. Using those new lottery forecasts combined with the December THEC projections -- lottery sales have set new records every month of fiscal year 2012 which began in July 1 -- PolitiFact Tennessee estimates that in the 2020-21 academic year, there may actually be a $2.2 million operating surplus in the scholarship program. And at that point, we calculate the reserve fund would stand at about $262 million.

Sen. Gresham made her remarks about there being only ""a few years more"" of reserve cushion immediately after Hargrove’s presentation -- saying she preferred to press ahead with the higher eligibility standards. THEC estimates that those higher standards will trim between $17 million and $20 million a year from the scholarship program’s costs, because it cuts the number of students who qualify for the full $4,000 annual award.  But in addition to those savings, her bill recommends a $10 million increase in the funding flowing from lottery proceeds (in this case, the reserve fund)  to the need-based Tennessee Student Assistance grants annually for the next 10 years. That cuts the annual savings about in half.

Our ruling

In pushing for more stringent standards for students to qualify for the state’s lottery scholarships, Gresham said recently recurring deficits in the program could only be sustained for ""a few years more."" For Tennessee’s huge lottery reserve fund to be depleted would mean exponentially unprecedented deficits that are not seen by even the most pessimistic of projections.

Gresham’s claim is unsupported by the numbers and we rule it False.

Rick Perry says photo ID required to purchase Sudafed in Texas
","
Defending the blocked Texas law requiring voters to present photo IDs at the polls, Gov. Rick Perry pointed out that similar identification is already required for some activities.

In an interview with Fox News on March 16, 2012, Perry told anchor Bill Hemmer: ""It goes without saying that in today’s world, having a photo ID -- whether it’s to get on an airplane, or whether it’s to cash a check or whether it’s to check a library book out -- is pretty standard fare.""

Hemmer interjected: ""Well, you need a photo ID in New York to buy Sudafed."" Chuckling, Perry replied: ""And I might add, in Texas too.""

The issue was raised a few days after the U.S. Department of Justice concluded that a Texas mandate that voters present photo IDs could prevent thousands of Hispanic Texas voters from casting ballots — thus violating federal voting-rights laws. According to a March 12, 2012, Associated Press news article, the government’s objection means the Texas law, which Perry signed in 2011, cannot be enforced unless a federal court in Washington clears the way.

An aside: Perry may have overstated the hurdle for library books. In December 2010, we rated Mostly False a similar claim by Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst.after finding that libraries did not require photo IDs at checkout, though patrons of most libraries had to show a photo ID when applying for a library card.

We burrowed in to see if it’s correct that Texas purchasers of Sudafed must present a photo ID.

Sudafed, a decongestant, contains pseudoephedrine, which is a precursor drug to manufacturing illegal methamphetamines.

A 2005 Texas law required pharmacies to make a person purchasing pills containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or nopseudoephedrine to display a driver's license or other ID containing the purchaser's photograph, as noted online by the Texas State Board of Pharmacy.

A legislative summary of the proposal, offering the measure’s rationale, said that in 2000, the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse reported that 1,821 people were admitted into Texas treatment centers for methamphetamine abuse; as of 2004, that number had risen to 11,238.

So, case closed?

Pretty much, Gay Dodson, executive director of the state pharmacy board, told us, and she pointed out by email that a federal act, also approved in 2005, includes a photo ID requirement.

According to information on a Department of Justice web page, the federal law requires customers purchasing products containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine to show a photo ID issued by a state or federal government. If the purchaser lacks such an ID, other types may be used, such as a U.S. passport, certain unexpired foreign passports, a school ID card with a photograph or voter registration card, among alternatives.

The Texas law requires a business making an over-the-counter sale of a product containing ephedrine,  pseudoephedrine or norpseudoephedrine to make the purchaser show a driver’s license or other form of photo ID that indicates the person is 16 or older. Dodson noted, too, that legislators in 2011 amended the law to specify that the presented IDs must be government-issued.

Upshot: Perry’s Sudafed statement reflects both state and federal ID requirements. It’s True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/28/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-photo-id-required-purchase-sudafed/

Wisconsin Democratic Party spokesman Zielinski says state GOP tweeted that women ‘should get paid less and not be able to make health care decisions’
","
In the recall election facing Gov. Scott Walker, parties and activists from all sides are tweeting a steady stream of commentary, tips and insults.

One of the most prolific tweeters is Graeme Zielinski, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. Zielinski tweets several times a day, and has more than 1,000 followers. His personal account lists his position with the state party.

Most of the time, Zielinski offers his own opinions about politics and stories of the day. Occasionally, he ""retweets"" things posted by others -- the Twitter way to share those views with your own readers, sometimes with a little extra commentary.

This appeared to be what was going on in one of Zielinski’s messages on March 8, 2012. We often get suggestions from readers, including political figures and campaigns. The original  message was pointed out to us by Ciara Matthews, campaign spokeswoman for Walker.

Here’s what Zielineski tweeted:

RT @WisGOP: Happy International Women's Day! You ladies should get paid less and not be able to make health care decisions.

For those unfamiliar with Twitter, here’s what is behind the lingo: The tweet made it appear as if Zielinski was ""re-tweeting"" (RT) a message put out by the Wisconsin Republican Party (@WisGOP).

While Zielinski is often sarcastic in his posts, this one appeared to be a straightforward retweet.

One little problem: The state GOP never tweeted it.

We asked Zielinski where the message came from.

His response: ""It was me ‘Tweeting’ as them, since they voted to cut equal pay protections and put new roadblocks in between women and their doctors.""

Ok. That’s pretty simple.The tweet was fabricated to try and make a point. 
It's unclear what measures Zielinski was referring to. 
We previously examined a claim regarding a bill on the equal pay issue awaiting action by Walker. State Rep. Cory Mason (D-Racine) claimed legislation approved by state Republicans would repeal a law that ensures ""that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job."" We rated that statement False because the bill in question does not ensure pay equity, but relates to the rights of workers to sue in state court over discrimination-related damages. 
Walker has also drawn criticism for canceling a state contract with Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, which provides services related to the cancer screenings in four counties. The actual screenings, however, didn’t end but were taken over by Winnebago County (Indeed, the contract in question related not to providing the screenings, but a program to help sign people up to get them). We rated Pants on Fire a statement by U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) that claimed Waker ""eliminated ‘cancer screenings for uninsured women’ and offered ‘no alternatives.’"" 
We asked the state GOP for its response to the fake tweet under its name.

""As a former reporter for The Onion, Graeme clearly has the experience to completely fabricate content for his frivolous attacks, and it highlights the utter lack of integrity of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, given they employ his false attacks as the official message of their organization,"" wrote party spokesman Ben Sparks.

It also appears the faked message violates the Twitter rules known as the ""terms of service.""

""By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms,"" Twitter says.
Here’s a key rule, listed first under ""Content Boundaries and Use of Twitter"":

Impersonation: You may not impersonate others through the Twitter service in a manner that does or is intended to mislead, confuse, or deceive others.

And here’s another:

Twitter users are not allowed to ""in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information.""

George LeMieux says Connie Mack 'took 7 1/2 years to finish college'
","
George LeMieux depicts Florida Republican U.S. Senate rival Connie Mack as a man who vaulted from college party boy to congressman. And those college days, well, they lasted awhile, according to LeMieux.

In the Web ad ""Two and a Half Macks"" LeMieux says that  ""Connie the IV took seven and a half years to finish college,"" while showing a buffoonish-like Mack wearing a T-shirt that says ""Kollege"" and dancing around in front of a University of Florida sign.

We’ve already checked other claims in the same February 2012 Web ad including that Mack ""failed to pay his child support"" (False) and whether his only job in the real world was an events coordinator for Hooters (Mostly False). In this item, we will explore how long it took Mack to finish college.

Mack won a seat in the state House of Representatives, representing Broward and Palm Beach counties in 2000. He then moved to Southwest Florida and won a seat in Congress in 2004.

LeMieux’s campaign directed us to a 2000 article in the Palm Beach Post, which detailed Mack’s route to his college degree:

""Born Cornelius H. McGillicuddy, the younger Mack attended public high school in northern Virginia, transferring in the middle of his junior year to the Massanutten Military School in Woodstock, Va.

""He left the military high school a year later in January 1986, lacking an English credit to graduate, and finished his high school requirement by enrolling that month at Sante Fe Community College in Gainesville.

""He spent 2 1/2 years at the community college and transferred to the University of Florida in May 1988. He graduated from the university five years later, and three months shy of his 26th birthday, with a bachelor's degree in advertising.""

Subsequent news articles have repeated that it took Mack seven years, or seven and a half years, to finish college, including a 2012 Miami Herald article about Mack’s past. The Herald wrote about Mack’s time in college in connection to a legal case stemming from a 1992 bar brawl with professional baseball player Ron Gant. A jury found Gant started the fight but Mack didn’t win the legal damages or fees that he sought. The article stated that ""Gant’s legal team sought to portray Mack as a troublemaking lightweight, noting he went to military school and that it took him more than seven years to get an advertising degree that, ultimately, he parlayed into a consultancy to promote Hooters, the Florida restaurant chain known for its scantily clad waitresses.’’

We contacted spokespersons for the two schools mentioned in the Palm Beach Post article.

Known as Sante Fe Community College at the time (it’s now called Sante Fe College), Mack started in the spring term of 1986 and graduated in June 1988 with an associates of arts degree, said registrar Lynn Sullivan. That’s about two and a half years.

Mack then transferred to the University of Florida in May 1988 and graduated in May 1993 with a bachelor’s of science degree in advertising, UF spokesman Stephen Orlando said. That’s about five years.

So the math works. But there’s more to this story.

We first asked about the overlap from May-June 1988, when Mack was technically a student at Sante Fe and UF. Orlando, the UF spokesman, said that it wasn’t unusual -- students can be admitted and register for classes with the presumption that they will earn the associate’s degree during that same semester -- in this case, the ""summer A"" semester of 1988.

Then there’s the Post reference that Mack was finishing his high school requirements by enrolling in community college. Sullivan, the Sante Fe registrar, told us in an email that she couldn’t provide additional information.

Mack campaign spokesman David James says the amount of time it took Mack to finish college depends on PolitiFact’s definition. For starters, Mack was dual-enrolled in high school and college in the spring of 1986 -- so the date he enrolled in community college overlaps technically with the time he would still be considered in high school. 
On top of that, James said, Mack took two years off from school -- 1991 and 1992 -- to work a full-time sales job. Mack finished school through correspondence classes, earning his diploma in 1993.

That information -- at least the part about Mack being away from UF for 1991 and 1992 -- is corroborated through school records.

Orlando said that Mack was at UF starting with the ""summer A"" session in May 1988. He continued at UF through the fall of 1990, records show. But Mack did not take classes in 1991 or 1992. He returned for the spring semester of 1993, taking a couple of courses that were not on campus.

That means  Mack was taking classes at or through UF for about three years, not five.

Our ruling

The claim here is that Mack ""took seven and a half years to finish college.""

There’s a kernel of truth to that statement. Mack enrolled at Sante Fe Community College in 1986 and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor’s degree about seven and a half years later in 1993.

But UF records show that Mack did not take classes for two of those years, 1991 and 1992. There’s also a minor point that Mack says he was dual-enrolled in community college at the same time he was completing his high school degree.

Those, to us, are critical facts that would give someone seeing the ad a much different impression of Mack’s college career -- which fits our definition of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/mar/28/george-lemieux/lemieux-says-congressman-mack-took-7-12-years-fini/

Email says a Texas rodeo crowd gave standing ovation for Obama joke with racial tinge
","
Rodeo clowns are used to taking a beating. But there’s an anti-Obama email bouncing around Texas that some say unfairly roughs up one cowboy entertainer.

We were forwarded a chain email March 2, 2012, that purports to describe an event at the 2012 San Angelo rodeo, which was held February 16-26. Between saddle bronc events, according to the email, a rodeo clown performed a skit with a racially tinged punchline mocking President Barack Obama.

And, the letter says, the crowd responded with ""an immediate deafening roar and standing ovation -- 6,000 strong. ...It lasted for 3-4 minutes... 100+ db (decibels) at least.""

Did a crowd of Texans cheer, and did the clown tell, a joke calling Obama a ""black imposter""?

We talked by phone with Keith Isley of Goldston, N.C., the award-winning rodeo clown who performed the skit, and Boyd Polhamus, a Brenham rancher and professional rodeo announcer who was on horseback in the arena with Isley, serving as ""straight man"" for the jokes. Rodeo official Tom Thompson told us this skit took place February 22.

Isley said his wife had been sent a copy of the email by the time he got home from Texas.

""The people, or the person, that started this has definitely misquoted what was said, and I told my wife, ‘I know what I said, I know what took place, and it’s definitely not what this person has seen or heard.’ ""

Isley said the comedy routine began with him being announced as Carlos Ortega, champion trick roper, and that the skit has to do with ""pretending to be someone you’re not.""

""That’s the way it starts off,"" Isley said. ""There’s a lot to the act. It was quoted in there (the email), me saying about the black president. That’s the main thing; that’s what everybody is getting so bent out of shape about. And that was not said by me.""

According to the email, after the announcer reveals that the supposed champion trick roper is a phony, the clown says, ""Well, actually I was thinking if a black imposter can pretend to be president of the United States, then I ought to be able to pretend I'm a world champion trick roper!""

We asked Isley to tell us how the joke did end, and he said, ""There’s a lot of punchlines to the whole act. ‘Black president’ was not used in that act."" The crowd reaction was also exaggerated, he said: ""They did respond; nothing to that amount.""

Polhamus agreed, telling us by email that the chain letter ""question is filled with hyperbole, and sadly, inaccuracy."" Speaking about the email’s anonymous author, Polhamus said, ""Where he is flat-plain wrong and inaccurate is in his use of the words ‘black imposter.’ Neither of those words were uttered by the clown or yours truly in the skit. In any context. Either separately or together.""

Other descriptions in the email are also off, he said.

""The coliseum in which the event is held barely holds 5,000 people, not 6,000. The introduction used to pretend the clown may actually be a noted trick roper from south of the border is not nearly as extravagant or embellished as the author of the e-mail asserts. The lines about speaking in Spanish and English are relatively accurate, but to call his physical motion a ‘matador flourish’ is a huge embellishment.""

The crowd response was exaggerated, Polhamus said. ""There was no standing ovation, and while I didn’t have a db meter on me, I’ve heard 100 db roars before at football games and rodeos. And I would argue that the audience’s response was nowhere near that loud, and I definitely take issue with the fact that the writer claims it lasted ‘3-4 minutes.’ My best guess is whatever ovation it received was over in less than 15 seconds.""

Justin Jonas, executive director of the San Angelo rodeo, told us that there was an Obama joke, but it wasn’t exactly the one laid out in the chain email. By Jonas’ recollection, the clown, challenged for posing as world-class trick roper, replied: ""If Obama can impersonate a president, then I can impersonate a trick roper."" Jonas said too that audience members appreciated the joke, but there was no standing ovation.

Thompson, the rodeo’s marketing coordinator, also told us that there was no standing ovation and that the words ""black"" and ""imposter"" were not used.

""I remember when we made fun of George W. Bush and his vocabulary in our coliseum, and Bill Clinton and his girlfriends,"" Thompson said. ""We don’t choose sides."" The rodeo and stock show foundation is a tax-exempt charity, he said, ""and we go out of our way not to offend anybody.""

An editor at the San Angelo Standard-Times, Sandy Rojas, and KLST-TV/KSAN-TV news director David Wagner told us that although their news organizations covered the rodeo every night, they had not heard about such an incident.

The version of the email PolitiFact received has at the bottom the name and title of Sheriff Cotton Elliott of King County, in the Texas Panhandle. Elliott told us he had received a version of the email and forwarded it to a friend, and later received a version with his name and title in large type at the bottom. He told us he did not write the email, did not know who had written it and was ""not pleased"" to learn his name had been attached to it.

We found two rodeo-goers who said they saw Isley’s skit, but their recollections differ: One said he remembered hearing part of an Obama joke, the other did not.

Don Miller, a precinct chair with the Tom Green County Republican Party who told us he was in the stands with his granddaughter during the skit, said he heard the crowd response but not the Obama joke itself.  ""I understood from the reaction that it had something to do with Obama and that it was, what’s the right word, it was not in good taste with Obama,"" he said. Some people laughed and clapped, he said, but others booed and ""generally it was not received well.""

Though Miller told us his recollection was not clear (he was keeping an eye on his granddaughter), he said he thought the objectionable aspect of the joke was respect, not race.

""It was just that he (Obama) was pretending to be president, and it was the butt of the joke, like this guy was pretending to be a trick roper,"" he said.

""I just don’t think that’s funny. He is the president. Whether you like it or not, he is the president; he’s not pretending to be president,"" Miller said. ""Even though I don’t agree with anything he has done, he’s still the president, and he deserves your respect of the office if nothing else.""

Was there any racial content to the skit? Miller says no.

""No, I don’t think it had anything -- He could have been blue, and it wouldn’t have made any difference. I don’t think it had anything to do with race at all,"" Miller said.

The description of a standing ovation and a 100-decibel roar was ""baloney,"" he said. ""They didn’t like that comment about the president.""

San Angelo dentist Rudy Izzard told us he saw the clown’s routine -- including his offering proof that he could speak Spanish by saying ""Taco Bell."" There was no joke about Obama the time he was there, Izzard said. ""I would have noticed that,"" Izzard said. ""I just don’t think they’d allow that.""

Linda Shoemaker, chair of the Tom Green County Democratic Party, told us she had not heard of the incident or the email.

We sought video unsuccessfully. Wagner said his TV stations filmed competitive events but not the comedy routines. Mike Oliver, the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association’s corporate accounts manager, said no videos were made by his organization because the San Angelo rodeo is not televised. On YouTube.com, several video clips are labeled as being from that rodeo, but we found none with this joke.

Our ruling

Isley appears to have made a wisecrack about Obama impersonating a president. However, we found no confirmation that the joke included a racial reference or that the audience gave a standing ovation. This chain email has an element of truth; we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/mar/28/chain-email/email-says-texas-rodeo-crowd-gave-standing-ovation/

Santorum accuses Romney of favoring high gas prices in Massachusetts
","
How is Mitt Romney similar to Barack Obama? He likes high gas prices, according to rival Rick Santorum.

Campaigning in Wisconsin ahead of the state primary, Santorum spoke to a crowd in Racine on March 25, 2012. In this video clip, he skewers Romney’s past statements on gasoline prices and what to do about them.

""Who said, when he was governor of Massachusetts, we are going to have to live with high gas prices, it's a good thing because it will reduce consumption, we don't want to produce any more gasoline? That would be Mitt Romney,"" Santorum said.

We decided to check whether that’s a fair paraphrase of Romney’s words.

Romney’s words then

Santorum’s campaign spokesman, Hogan Gidley, pointed us to a post on the conservative blog Poor Richard’s News from March 22, 2012. The blog post, as well as others in the Washington Post and the New Republic, unearthed a story from 2006 when Romney was governor of Massachusetts.

Gas prices had risen that spring, and Romney and Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey were asked at a press conference about possible remedies. The two disagreed over suspending the state’s 23 ½ cent per gallon gas tax -- Healey favored it, while Romney said a tax break would only encourage more consumption.

""I don’t think that now is the time, and I’m not sure there will be the right time, for us to encourage the use of more gasoline,"" Romney said, according to the Patriot Ledger in Quincy, Mass.

Romney said he preferred to press for more fuel-efficient vehicles rather than reduce prices, the story said, and quoted Romney, ""I’m very much in favor of people recognizing that these high gasoline prices are probably here to stay.""

An Associated Press story from the same press conference provided a longer quote from Romney:

""I am very much in favor of people recognizing that these high gasoline prices are probably here to stay and that the appropriate action for us to take is to find ways to find fuel conservation,"" the AP wrote.

Santorum’s words now

Santorum attributed three different ideas to Romney:

* Americans are going to have to live with high gas prices.

* That's a good thing because it will reduce consumption.

* America shouldn’t produce any more gasoline.

The first is an accurate paraphrase. Romney said high prices are ""probably here to stay."" 
In the second one, Santorum is misstating what Romney said. Romney's statement wasn't a value judgment that high prices were beneficial. It was a practical argument in favor of finding ways to deal with high prices.

In the third idea he attributed to Romney, that America shouldn't produce any more gasoline, Santorum veered off the path completely. Nowhere in the Patriot Ledger or Associated Press coverage does Romney (or anyone else) mention gasoline production or drilling.

Our ruling

Santorum said: ""Who said, when he was governor of Massachusetts, we are going to have to live with high gas prices, it's a good thing because it will reduce consumption, we don't want to produce any more gasoline? That would be Mitt Romney.""

In 2006, during another fuel price spike, Romney said he believed high prices were ""here to stay,"" and he struck a practical tone, suggesting that should lead to greater conservation and efficiency. He said there may never be a right time to push for more gas use. Those are points fairly summed up in Santorum’s remarks. But Romney didn't make a value judgment that high gas prices a ""good thing.""

And he completely misrepresented Romney’s position when he said the former Massachusetts governor opposed increasing production. In the situation in 2006, Romney simply didn’t address that topic.

On balance, we rate Santorum’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/28/rick-santorum/santorum-accuses-romney-favoring-high-gas-prices-m/

Steve Rothman claims Bill Pascrell “voted to remove” the public option from the national health care reform law
","
As Democratic primary voters search for differences between U.S. Reps. Steve Rothman and Bill Pascrell, Rothman claims that support for a government-run health insurance plan separates them.

Calling himself the more progressive Democrat, Rothman pointed out various differences between him and Pascrell during a March 16 interview on NJToday. Rothman and Pascrell are preparing to battle June 5 for their party’s nomination to represent the 9th Congressional District.

Among those differences, Rothman claimed that ""Bill voted to remove the public option from the Affordable Health Care Act.""

PolitiFact New Jersey checked the voting records and found that Rothman is wrong to claim Pascrell voted to remove the public option. In fact, the congressmen cast the same votes on major health care reform measures in late 2009 and early 2010.

Like Rothman, Pascrell voted in November 2009 in support of a House bill that included a public plan as part of overhauling the nation’s health care system. A public option was later scrapped in a U.S. Senate version of health care reform, which became the final law.

First, let’s explain the congressmen’s voting records on health care reform.

In a 220-215 vote on Nov. 7, 2009, the House narrowly approved the Affordable Health Care for America Act, which included a public health insurance option. Pascrell and Rothman both voted for the bill.

The following month, the Senate approved its own health care reform bill, called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, in a 60-39 vote. That legislation did not include a public plan option. 
The House would later pass the Senate bill in a 219-212 vote on March 21, 2010, sending it to President Barack Obama to become law. The reform law was later modified by a separate piece of legislation.

Pascrell and Rothman both voted for the Senate bill, and the legislation making changes to it.

So, Pascrell did not vote ""to remove the public option."" Pascrell voted for a House bill that included the public option, but a Senate health care overhaul bill -- which became the final law -- did not include it.

Paul Swibinski, a consultant to Rothman’s campaign, told us in an e-mail that ""Steve misspoke when he said that Pascrell voted against the public option. Steve meant to say that Pascrell opposed the public option.""

Swibinski pointed to a January 2010 Congressional Quarterly Today article, which stated Pascrell was proposing a series of scaled-back health care bills. ""No 'public option,' no mandates, no entitlements,"" Pascrell is quoted as saying in the article.

Sean Darcy, a spokesman for the Pascrell campaign, argued that at the time of the article, ""the public option was dead."" Various news articles in early January 2010 indicate that House Democrats had abandoned hopes for a public option in light of the Senate vote.

""Pascrell was still very much in favor of the public option and was extremely supportive of it,"" Darcy said in an e-mail. ""As noted, the Senate bill did not include the public option so the consensus among the people actually fighting to get a substantive health care bill passed was that this piece was no longer an option. With all this in mind, Pascrell was acknowledging that we needed to move on and find a way to get health care reform done.""

Before and after the health care reform was enacted, Pascrell publicly expressed his support for a government-run health insurance plan.

In an August 2009 opinion piece, Pascrell wrote, ""Health care reform without the public health insurance option would be a hollow one."" An August 2010 article on PolitickerNJ.com quoted a Pascrell spokesman as saying the congressman ""remains a supporter of the public option.""

Our ruling

In an NJToday interview, Rothman claimed Pascrell ""voted to remove the public option from the Affordable Health Care Act.""

But Pascrell voted in November 2009 for a House bill that included a public option. The Senate approved a reform bill that didn’t include a public option, and that version became the final law.

Details hurt Georgia lawmaker's claim
","
OK, who enjoys calling customer service?

Occasionally, the voice on the other end of the phone, if you’re able to talk to a live person, is halfway around the world, and the conversation is often difficult to understand because of accents and poor telephone reception.

That usually happens when you’re calling about your laptop that’s not working properly, but how about calls to Georgia’s food stamp call center program?

""Did you know that JPMorgan Chase right now has a contract to administer the food stamps program, and if you call the number you are instructed to on the website you will be speaking to someone for whom English is a second language and they live in another country,"" said state Sen. Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat. ""And if you ask them where they live, they will say it’s a security issue and I cannot reveal that.""

Orrock was talking about Senate Bill 492, which is aimed at improving the state’s purchasing process on construction projects. She wanted an amendment to the bill that would require the call center program be administered in the U.S.A.

""We contract with a private corporation, and they promptly ship the jobs overseas to administer the program, the state program, in this case for food stamps, the state program is administered from foreign shores,"" Orrock said.

So, is this state program administered from foreign shores?

Georgia’s food stamp program, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is managed by the state’s Department of Human Resources. The website has links to information in 11 languages.

DHR spokeswoman Ravae Graham told PolitiFact Georgia that only 3 percent of the calls are handled overseas. Graham also sent us the most recent monthly call data. In February, 1.3 percent of the approximately 2.85 million calls were handled in India and Mexico. All the others were handled in this country.

The senator initially questioned the numbers in a telephone interview and asked for a few days to provide us information. A few days later, she sent us a report done in November by Channel 2 Action News that investigated the use of food stamp call centers outside the U.S. The report noted that 3 percent of those calls were handled overseas.

Orrock was interviewed in that report. She talked about her concerns that some of these calls were handled outside the U.S. ""rather than creating those jobs here, because we will be employing people who will then put their paycheck back into our economy.""

Orrock told us in a statement that she could have spoken more precisely. She said ""administered"" was a poor choice of words.

""I am aware that the entire program is not delivered by people working overseas, and throughout my speech made reference to the call centers being delivered overseas,"" Orrock said in a statement. ""In speaking without prepared text perhaps I made a poor choice of words in saying administer, but my meaning was clear and I repeated several times that I was referring to the offshoring of call center jobs for the food stamp program, and not the administration of the entire food stamp program.

""Some of those call center services are delivered here, and my amendment was not aimed at those services,"" Orrock continued. ""The sole purpose of my amendment was to address the jobs offshored with Georgia taxpayer dollars.""

Orrock’s amendment narrowly passed the Senate, but it was removed from the legislation when it came to the House of Representatives.

As for our call on her claim, only a small percentage of those food stamp calls are handled outside the U.S. Her statement contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical factors, such as the 97 percent of calls handled here, that would give a different impression of someone unfamiliar with the program.

Ohio Federation of Teachers says Cleveland reform plan lacks any proven methods for success
","
When Mayor Frank Jackson introduced his plan to radically reshape Cleveland public schools, it was almost inevitable that the union representing Cleveland teachers would push back.

Condemning the proposal as a crackdown on the collective bargaining rights of teachers akin to last year’s controversial Senate Bill 5, both the Cleveland Teachers Union and the larger group they belong to — the Ohio Federation of Teachers — spoke out.

Jackson’s plan would possibly expand the school year or school day, set-up a merit pay for teachers, base layoffs on teacher performance and make getting rid of poor teachers easier. Seniority would no longer be the sole determining factor in layoffs and continuing contracts would end for new teachers and be limited for teachers already in the system. (On March 23, the Cleveland Teachers Union offered Jackson a counter-proposal which his administration is currently studying.)

At a state board of education meeting March 12, Gov. John Kasich offered strong support for the Jackson plan. At the same meeting, Ohio Federation of Teachers officials hand-delivered a letter from the union’s new president, Melissa Cropper, to each member of the state board.

Cropper’s letter and a news release OFT issued the same day both said the measure does nothing to benefit students and everything to attack teachers.

""The plan lacks any data or methods proven to raise student achievement and should not be supported blindly,"" read Cropper’s statement in part.

That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. We decided to study up on Cropper’s charge.

First, we turned the Ohio Federation of Teachers officials for supporting evidence.

Lisa Zellner, OFT’s director of communications, said the claims stems from the fact that many of the provisions in the plan pertain to the teaching contract. She said the union knows of no empirical studies or data that backs up Jackson’s specific plan.

""It’s not about increasing student achievement,"" Zellner said. ""It’s just about going after the teachers, it’s going after the contract.""

Even provisions that may have some support in educational research — for example, increasing the length of school days or the school year — aren’t spelled out enough in the mayor’s plan to know whether they would be effective or not, she said.

Eric Gordon, CEO of the Cleveland Public Schools and the main architect of the Jackson plan, sees things differently. He said the plan is part of a broader strategy of district-wide reform known as the portfolio approach that is being tried in several dozen big-city school districts.

And while Gordon conceded ""there is no empirical study that shows the portfolio strategy is the one strategy"" he said there is some evidence that some of the approaches in the Jackson plan have worked to raise test scores.

For example, Gordon mentioned research that has been done by the Center on Reinventing Public Education. The non-profit group recently issued a report on a number of big city school districts trying reforms similar to those in Jackson’s plan.

The group’s report looked at Denver schools, where many teachers voluntarily opted for a merit pay system instead of the standard teaching contract. Known as the ProComp program, it ties teacher pay to education levels and offers bonus pay to teachers who work in the toughest schools and whose students score higher on tests.

Researchers at the University of Colorado found ""significant and positive ProComp effects at both middle and high school for both math and reading, and the effects are larger at high school than middle school."" The researchers cautioned, however, that it generally was the more effective teachers who opted into the program.

Another approach tried in Colorado — a 2008 law called the Innovation Schools Act — gives school officials who opt into the program greater school autonomy and flexibility in operations and academic decisions.

""The innovation schools are experiencing growth in test scores but many were exceeding state averages prior to being innovation schools,"" said a recent report from researchers who have studied the schools.

The Baltimore school district — after working hand in hand with the union — implemented a reworked teacher contract largely based on teacher evaluations and student test scores. That contract only went into effect last year so it’s too soon to say whether it has improved student test scores.

The Jackson plan also calls for increased learning time through either longer school days or a longer school year, a hot topic among educational academics. Research on the subject is mixed — a fact Gordon acknowledged. ""Well, no one factor in of itself is a magic bullet solution,"" he said. ""You are going to find time studies where it did work and time studies where it didn’t work.""

In 2005, Massachusetts became the first state to significantly expand learning time. It now has a program in several dozen schools that extended student learning time by about 25 percent. Test scores in those districts have risen by double the rate for English and math when compared to schools with normal hours and five times the rate in science.

Additionally, a charter school program known as KIPP (Knowledge is Power Program) has seen results from providing as much as 60 percent more learning time in core subjects.

However, additional time doesn’t always mean that student test scores rise. A $100 million effort in Miami schools to extend school hours by one hour and add 10 days to the school calendar hasn’t produced higher student test scores and is largely considered a failure.

So where are we left on this issue as the bell rings and PolitiFact class is dismissed?

Ohio AFT union head Melissa Cropper said Mayor Frank Jackson’s sweeping plan to improve Cleveland schools ""lacks any data or methods proven to raise student achievement"" as she labeled the proposal an attack on teachers. For PolitiFact Ohio, a key part of that statement is ""lacks any.""

While the specific approach Jackson mapped out for Cleveland hasn’t been proven, it does clearly contain elements that researchers suggest may work — at least in some cases -- such as merit pay for teachers, greater flexibility for schools in how they go about their business and longer school days or school year.

While the teacher federation leader’s statement contains some element of truth — there’s no specific study or data that proves definitively that Jackson’s approach will raise student achievement — it ignores critical facts about the successes that have resulted in some places that have tried some of the elements of Jackson’s plan. Those details could give a listener a different impression.

"['Rhode Island', 'Education', 'Gambling', 'History', 'State Budget', 'Harold Metts']","
R.I. State Sen. Harold M. Metts says voters were promised money from the Rhode Island lottery would be used for education.
","
On March 6, state Sen. Harold M. Metts introduced a bill  that would require any new state gambling revenue be used for education.

That would include new revenue from the Twin River and Newport Grand slot parlors if they’re allowed to add casino table games.

Metts said he wants any additional gambling revenue to be used solely for supporting elementary and secondary education. That ""would be a positive step toward honoring years of promises to fund education with gaming revenue,"" he was quoted as saying in a General Assembly news release. ""Senator Metts said he remembers the birth of the lottery in Rhode Island, when state residents were enticed to vote for it with the promise that the money would be used for education,"" the release says.

Many Rhode Islanders share Metts’ belief that the Rhode Island Lottery was created based on the promise that the revenue would go into the schools.

But is that conventional wisdom based on fact?

When we asked what he based that statement on, Metts said that when he was campaigning for reelection last year, a senior citizen living at the Charlesgate nursing home grilled him about the lottery, saying that money was supposed to go to education.

He said the constituent was ""very knowledgeable about politics"" and he’d be surprised if the man was incorrect. ""The generation ahead of me -- all they talk about is that the money was supposed to go to education,"" he said. ""In their mind, that money was supposed to go to education.""

So we went back in time to find out. Here’s some history about the lottery from its 2011 financial report.

On Nov. 6, 1973, voters approved a constitutional amendment clearing the way for the lottery’s creation the following year.  ""The original purpose of the Rhode Island Lottery was to make up for the revenue lost from allowing the value of a trade-in automobile toward the sales tax liability on a new automobile,"" the report states. It says nothing about dedicating money for education.

Now let’s go back a little further.

On Sept. 25, 1973, The Providence Journal reported that then-Gov. Philip W. Noel ""embraced the idea that the constitutional convention should propose outright repeal of the lottery ban."" The story noted that a member of the convention’s lottery committee, Roderick A.J. Cavanagh, R-Narragansett, had proposed that net lottery proceeds ""be applied exclusively to or in aid or support of education in this state.""

But two days later, the Journal reported that the convention’s lottery committee had voted 14 to 2 ""against recommending that lottery proceeds be earmarked for a specific purpose such as education.""

In an interview Tuesday, Cavanagh said ""early on (funding for education) was a prime mover in a lot of the discussion, but as you can see, it didn’t stay that way. As it turned out, the money went to general treasury."" Another 1973 convention delegate, former Sen. Raymond E. Grimes, D-Providence, said officials talked about earmarking lottery revenue for education, ""but it was never promised.""

The proposed constitutional amendment made no mention of mandating that lottery revenue go to education, and voters approved the amendment by a vote of 83,757 to 25,840. ""Lottery is a big winner,"" the Journal front page announced on Nov. 7, 1973.

The story quoted Noel’s lawyer as saying the governor was committed to ""removing the inequity of the sales tax on auto trade-ins with the proceeds of a lottery,"" and that if proceeds are sufficient he also intended to examine other sales tax areas.

The author of that 1973 story, former Journal political columnist M. Charles Bakst, said, ""I do not recall a single official promoting the lottery by saying the money would go for education. In my opinion, this is a first-class myth.""

Peter J. O' Connell, who retired in 1993 after nearly 20 years as the Rhode Island Lottery’s first executive director, said lottery revenue went into the state’s general fund rather that any specific area in the state budget.

O’Connell -- a retired state police major who joked that he ""went from chasing bookies to being one of the biggest bookies"" -- said that while some of that money ended up going to schools, the lottery revenue was never specifically earmarked for education. That notion might have been based on ""rumors"" or ""wishful thinking,"" he said.

Gerald S. Aubin, the Rhode Island Lottery’s director for the past 16 years, agreed that lottery revenue has always gone into the general fund. He could think of just a couple of rare exceptions when instant ticket revenue went toward specific purposes, such as the arts.

Aubin said he often hears people saying that lottery revenue was supposed to be dedicated to education. ""I’m often asked that question, or I hear it on the radio or see it in the newspaper. It has almost become factual,"" he said. ""But I can never track down any evidence of that being the truth. Nothing I have ever seen supported that.""

Patrick T. Conley -- a lawyer and historian who served as secretary for the state’s 1973 constitutional convention and participated in drafting the lottery amendment -- said lotteries thrived in Rhode Island between 1744 and 1843, and the revenue went to a variety of civic purposes, including education. But Rhode Island banned lotteries in 1843, and when that ban lifted with the 1973 constitutional amendment, lottery revenue went into the general fund rather than being earmarked for a specific purpose, he said.

""Certainly, a number of delegates in committee and in debate were hopeful that the revenue raised by the lottery would help fund our educational system, but there was never, to my knowledge, a serious amendment to earmark lottery money for education,"" Conley said. ""The lottery was basically a revenue source for the state -- in emulation of New Hampshire, which had no income or sales tax but did have a lottery.""

Bakst said, ""I do have a guess as to why folks think the money was to go to education; I believe that early states to have a modern lottery -- New Hampshire, say -- did specify that the money go to schools. These early lotteries got enormous publicity because lotteries were such a novelty.""

Indeed, New Hampshire launched the country’s first state lottery in 1964, and all the net revenue was earmarked for public education between kindergarten and 12th grade, New Hampshire Lottery Commission spokeswoman Maura McCann said. ""That was the whole reason it passed successfully,"" she said. To date, the lottery has raised about $1.5 billion for New Hampshire public schools, she said.

Our ruling 
Sen. Harold Metts said he remembered that voters were enticed to vote for the lottery because the proceeds would be used for education.

As it turns out, Metts, a retired educator, has inadvertently provided Rhode Island with a teachable moment. He certainly is not the first person to make that claim. But if he had done his homework, he would know that all the evidence shows that no such promise was made.

Senate Republican web video says Obama's health care law 'forces' businesses to give up plans
","
Senate Republicans focused on what they called the president’s ""broken promises"" near the two-year anniversary of the health care law.

A Web video posted March 22, 2012, by the Senate Republican Conference details eight promises it says President Barack Obama has broken, countering with claims of its own.

We’re checking a few of them -- for example, the claim that Obama didn't keep his promise about reducing health care premiums. (We found Republicans’ response Mostly False.)

In this check, we’re focusing the Republicans' response to Obama's statement on Aug. 15, 2009: ""No matter what you've heard, if you like your doctor or health care plan, you can keep it.""

Back then, we found a similar claim by the president just Half True.

In this case, we’re fact-checking the response, offered by the Senate Republican Conference video in text on the screen:

""Reality: Up to 80% of small businesses will be forced to give up their current plans due to new Obamacare regulations.""

We wondered, is that the case?

‘Relinquishing their grandfathered status’

We talked with Kyle Downey, communications director for the Senate Republican Conference.

He pointed us to a table that includes an 80 percent figure. The table was published as part of the government’s interim final rules on ""grandfathered status"" for group health plans and health insurance coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

It matches a table published by Health and Human Services, also in June 2010.

Grandfathered status means that employer plans are allowed to remain largely as they were before the law was enacted.

As long as a health care plan doesn’t substantially change, it won’t have to comply with all parts of the new health care law, for example, the requirement that preventive health services be covered without any cost sharing. That provision was the subject of the recent contraceptives debate.

(All plans will have to meet some of the law’s requirements, such as no coverage exclusions for children with pre-existing conditions, no lifetime limits on coverage and extending parents’ coverage to young adults under 26.)

An employer may even switch to a similar plan with a different insurer, as long as it doesn’t make changes such as cutting benefits or increasing out-of-pocket spending.

If employers made such changes, say, by raising co-pays by more than $5, it would have to comply with the rest of the law, triggering requirements for a wider range of benefits that could cost more.

The 80 percent reflected the high-end estimate of the number of small employer plans that may ""relinquish"" grandfathered status by 2013. By comparison, the mid range estimate was 66 percent. The low-end estimate was 49 percent. 
'Forced'

Is giving up grandfathered status the same thing as small businesses being ""forced to give up their current plans""?

Not necessarily, said experts we spoke with on both sides of the health care debate.

Timothy Jost, a health care law expert at  Washington and Lee University School of Law, argues that small employers won’t be ""forced"" to give up their plans under the new law. They would have to change their plans themselves to lose their grandfathered status.

""If a small business (or individual, or large business) keeps its current plan, it is grandfathered, period,"" he said.

Eighty percent of small businesses may lose grandfathered status ""simply because they change their plans so much that they are no longer the same plan,"" he said.

Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was a consultant to both the Gov. Mitt Romney and Obama administrations in designing their health care plans, also takes issue with the word ""forced.""

""A key thing to watch out for in this debate is mixing up voluntary actions with ‘forced’ actions,"" he said. ""What the (Health and Human Services) memo says is that almost 80 percent of small firms will move out of grandfathered plans. It doesn’t say that they will be forced out — most of the moves will be voluntary as firms move to plans that they prefer. We don't know what the split is between voluntary and involuntary moves.  Even before Obamacare, most small firms change plans over time.""

Downey, the Senate Republican Conference spokesman, and health care expert Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute, argued the law will force employers to change plans.

Downey disagrees with Jost’s assessment that a plan change by an employer that would trigger loss of grandfathered status makes it a different plan.

""The idea that losing grandfathered status means the plan has changed is a bit silly — a $5 co-pay increase is enough to trigger loss of grandfathering,"" Downey said. ""The idea that such a small co-pay is tantamount to changing one's plan is frankly absurd.""

In other words, he argues that since a small change can trigger the requirement to comply with the health care law, it’s essentially forcing employers to comply.

Tanner, the author of the report ""Bad Medicine: A guide to the real costs and consequences of the new health care law,"" argues that changes would be forced because ""if you lose grandfathered status, when you renew, you have to come into compliance.""

And the law will make it harder for employers to maintain their current plans, his report says. Insurers won’t be able to enroll new business customers in plans that don’t comply with the law, meaning they may stop offering them. That would ""force"" companies to lose their grandfathered status, he argued.

""There's no doubt that a significant number of them will have to because of the new law,"" he said. ""... I think 80 percent is the high end of the range, but there's no doubt that a lot of people will be impacted in that way.""

How many businesses might change because they have no choice compared with those that shift voluntarily to pursue cheaper, better coverage?

""It's really hard to tell,"" he said.

Health and Human Services argues the switches will be primarily voluntary.

""The new health care law creates an online marketplace where small business owners can easily compare plan benefits and costs and determine if they qualify for a new tax credit for health insurance, which brings greater transparency and competition and affordability to the market,"" said Erin Shields, communications director for health care for HHS. ""When this new marketplace is online, it will be easier for small businesses to compare their options and choose the best private insurance plan for themselves and their employees.

""Of course small business owners also have the option to keep the plan they had before the law was passed as well.""

Our ruling

A Senate Republican Conference video argues that ""up to 80 percent of small businesses will be forced to give up their current plans due to new Obamacare regulations."" In doing so, it is choosing an estimate that is at the high end of a range that also includes estimates of 66 and 49 percent, but the video does say ""up to.""

Businesses give up that status by changing their plans, whether by choice or because of the exigencies of the market. The health care law doesn’t directly force businesses to give up their plans, which makes the statement only partially accurate.

Obama ad claims credit for cheaper prescription drugs
","
As the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments on the national health care law, a new Barack Obama campaign ad touts the improvements in Medicare benefits contained in the legislation.

Video clips of President Obama speaking about eliminating Medicare fraud play are interspersed with still shots of the president embracing retirees.

The text: ""As president he signed the Affordable Care Act ... and reduced the cost of prescription drugs for nearly 3.6 million Americans in 2011.""

We’re checking whether the ad is accurate that the health law -- and Obama, by extension -- are to credit for that many Medicare recipients paying less for prescription drugs last year.

The doughnut hole

Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs for beneficiaries, has always contained a coverage gap. The plan pays for drugs up to a dollar amount, but then Medicare recipients must cover the entire cost of prescriptions until catastrophic coverage kicks in.

Currently, beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D program must pay the first $310 for prescriptions. Then insurance then pays up to $2,830. At that point they’re in what's known as the doughnut hole with a gap in coverage until they hit an out-of-pocket limit of $4,550. At that point, their coverage takes over again, usually paying about 95 percent of the costs.

Jack Hoadley, a health policy analyst at Georgetown University, co-wrote a study for the Kaiser Family Foundation last year on the coverage gap. He pointed out that even those who reach the catastrophic threshold do so only after they have been paying the full price of their prescriptions for several months.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, slowly phases out the doughnut hole through price discounts and government subsidies, eliminating it completely in 2020.

The 2011 phase

Last year, under the terms of the health care law, the doughnut hole shrank a little with those eligible for Medicare receiving discounts on drugs once they reached the coverage gap.

Drug manufacturers were required to provide a 50 percent discount for covered brand name drugs, while there were federal subsidies (7 percent discount) for generic drugs, said Elizabeth Hargrave, a senior research scientist at the University of Chicago and co-author of the study with Hoadley.

""The brand-name drug discounts do not cause beneficiaries to reach the catastrophic coverage more slowly – they’re counted as if beneficiaries paid these amounts out of pocket. So this is true savings even for beneficiaries who subsequently reach the catastrophic limit,"" Hargrave added.

Both discounts will increase over time until the doughnut hole is effectively closed in 2020, she said.

So the reduced drug costs are real. What about the number of people who benefitted?

‘Nearly 3.6 million Americans’

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, estimated that total discounts added up to $2.1 billion, or an average of $604 per beneficiary.

It also said 3,576,640 people enjoyed those savings. (For a state-by-state breakdown, check out the chart at the bottom of the fact sheet.)

The CMS numbers are based on 2011 Part D claims data received through Feb. 29, 2012, the agency said.

We didn’t see any reason to doubt the figures, but CMS is a federal agency under Obama, and this is an Obama campaign ad. So we ran it by Hoadley and Hargrave, who both said the 3.6 million figure checks out.

Hargrave pointed us to another CMS chart, which totalled the number of beneficiaries in the doughnut hole in 2011 at 3,758,024 -- including the territories -- and about 3.6 million in the 50 states. (See the first chart in the zip file.)

Our ruling

Obama’s campaign ad credits the president, by fighting for and signing the health care law, with reducing the cost of prescription drugs for nearly 3.6 million Americans in 2011.

The law is saving Medicare beneficiaries money by phasing out the coverage gap, or doughnut hole. It accomplishes that by requiring discounts from drug companies and by providing subsidies in increasing amounts until the gap is eliminated. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid said about 3.6 million people saved about $2.1 billion on drugs in 2011.

Florida Rep. Jimmie Smith says lawmakers protected by First Amendment against drug testing
","
Miami Herald columnist Carl Hiaasen torched Florida lawmakers for passing a drug-testing bill for state workers that excluded one class of government employees: elected officials who passed the law.

Hiaasen took particular issue with the proposal’s House sponsor Rep. Jimmie Smith, a Republican from Lecanto, and his explanation for a failed attempt to require drug tests for Gov. Rick Scott and legislators.

""It was found to be unconstitutional to drug test elected officials because it prevents us, as citizens, from having that First Amendment right,"" Smith said. 
The defense was novel -- and also wrong. It turns out Smith confused elected officials with candidates, misinterpreted Supreme Court case law and cited the wrong amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
Here's what you need to know. 
The drug-testing bill signed into law by Gov. Rick Scott on March 19, 2012, allows state agencies to randomly test no more than 10 percent of their workforce every quarter. An employee who fails a test could be fired on the first offense. Scott said he will hold off implementing the new law until the outcome of an ACLU-led court challenge to Scott’s 2011 executive order requiring random drug testing at agencies, an issue the Legislature tried to correct through law.

Democrats hurled pointed questions at Smith during a February committee hearing on HB 1205, including why he would not favor drug-testing elected officials.

""Are you saying with your bill you are not in favor of making elected officials have drug tests?"" asked Rep. Joe Abruzzo, D-Wellington.

""Our bosses, our constituents, want it and we should do it,"" Smith said, explaining he paid $40 for a drug test after a constituent asked him to do it.

""So would you be open to amending your bill?"" Abruzzo asked.

""No,"" Smith said.

""Why not?"" Abruzzo said.

""Because it is succinctly decided by the U.S. Supreme Court that drug-testing elected officials would violate the First Amendment right of freedom of speech by being elected,"" Smith said.

We called Smith for more information. He said he was referencing Chandler vs. Miller, a 1997 Supreme Court decision that overturned a Georgia law requiring candidates for state office to prove they passed a urinalysis drug test within 30 days of qualifying for the ballot. Passing it in 1990, Georgia was the only state with such a law.

Two lower courts had ruled with the state, finding that the drug tests were okay because of the substantial trust voters hold for their elected officials in terms of safety, economic well-being and law enforcement.

But the U.S. Supreme Court, in an 8-1 vote, overturned those rulings in a suit brought by Libertarian lieutenant governor candidate Walter Chandler (the defendant, Zell Miller, was governor of Georgia), arguing the drug-testing requirement violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens from unreasonable search and seizure.

""However well-meant, the candidate drug test Georgia has devised diminishes personal privacy for a symbol's sake,"" wrote Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the majority opinion. ""The Fourth Amendment shields society against that state action.""

The law was not a response to a legitimate public safety concern about drug use among political candidates, Ginsburg continued, which might make blanket drug-tests permissible.

The court did not factor the First Amendment into its decision, even though the Libertarian candidates-turned-plaintiffs tried. They argued the drug tests violated their First, Fourth and Fourteenth amendment rights in their initial district court filing.

""If you refuse to take a drug test,"" Chandler argued, according to a 1997 USA Today account, ""it's like refusing to salute the flag of the drug war. For Libertarians, it's also like Georgia is saying: 'You can believe what you want. But you have to show contempt for what you and other Libertarians believe before you can even get on our ballot.' ""

So to recap: The Supreme Court tossed out a drug-testing requirement for candidates -- not elected officials -- based on the Fourth Amendment, not the First. The law wasn't tossed out on the grounds that they were candidates -- rather it was ruled invalid because it diminished someone's personal privacy.

We consulted First Amendment expert and attorney Patsy Palmer to be sure we weren’t missing something. ""There is nothing that I know of which would extend First Amendment privileges exclusively to lawmakers in the field of urine testing,"" she said. ""There’s utterly no case law on that as far as speech is concerned.""

She added: ""Anything that would give an exclusive First Amendment right to lawmakers rather than other citizens of the state seems to be a stretch.""

We should note the ACLU, which has strongly suggested it will sue over Smith’s law, agrees that lawmakers should not be drug-tested. But not because of the First Amendment.

The group thinks state employees -- and elected officials -- should be protected by the Fourth Amendment.

""If the Fourth Amendment applies in the halls of the Florida House of Representatives -– and it does –- it applies to other state office buildings as well,"" said ACLU spokesman Derek Newton.

Smith, for his part, told PolitiFact Florida that the question about lawmaker drug-testing is irrelevant. Per state law, leaders of the state House and Senate are already allowed to ""adopt rules, policies, or procedures for the employees and members of the legislative branch"" for drug tests.

The outcome of the ACLU’s legal challenge to Scott’s drug-testing executive order remains to be seen. It’s likely to influence implementation of the state’s new law. We’re not here to make that case. 
Our ruling 
Smith made the claim that elected officials have a special First Amendment protection from being tested for drugs. No court has gone close to that far. In a Georgia case, the Supreme Court ruled that candidates for office -- not elected officials -- cannot be forced to take a drug test because it violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution -- that’s not the one dealing with freedom of speech. 
Opponents to Florida's drug-testing law say the Fourth Amendment protects elected officials, candidates and state workers from being require to be tested for drugs. 
While that issue will likely be settled in the court system, Smith's claim can be decided by the Truth-O-Meter. It's False.

"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Tom Price']","
U.S. Rep. Price: Health care bill cost projections rose dramatically
","
Update: A prior version of this story said U.S. Rep. Tom Price's office did not respond to requests for comment by PolitiFact Georgia. His staffers did send us information about health care cost projections but did not provide an on-the-record comment.  
A talking point blasting President Barack Obama’s signature health care legislation is bouncing across Georgia’s political messaging echo chamber as the U.S. Supreme Court tackles the law.

Opponents of the 2010 bill have repeatedly said the changes are too expensive and have recently highlighted a March 2012 report from the Congressional Budget Office as proof.

U.S. Rep. Tom Price of Roswell joined the chorus March 14 with a news release.

""The new CBO projection estimates that the law will cost $1.76 trillion over 10 years -- well above the $940 billion Democrats originally claimed,"" said Price, a Republican.

U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, a Republican from Ranger, said something similar, as did a Texas candidate for the U.S. Senate. Fox News published a story that said the law will cost twice as much as originally estimated.

Oral arguments in the Supreme Court case began Monday. It’s widely considered to be one of the most politically fraught cases in years. 

We sought help from our sister site PolitiFact National, which tested a statement by Ted Cruz, the Texas candidate. He tweeted: ""Did you know ObamaCare will cost nearly twice as much as initially expected -- $1.8 TRILLION?""

PolitiFact National found that Cruz’s statement was False.  

The CBO’s estimates have increased, but far less than Cruz, Price and others have said.

The biggest problem is that their claims compare apples to oranges.

The CBO’s job is to review initiatives in Congress that may have an impact on the federal budget. It did so in 2010 for Obama’s health care overhaul.

That report projected that the program’s costs during a 10-year period starting in 2010 and ending in 2019 would total $938 billion.

This figure is the program’s ""gross"" cost and does not take into account plan features that will pay for some of the changes, such as new taxes on higher-income earners and penalties for those who opt out of insurance.

Costs will increase as the program phases in. Full implementation will take place in 2014.

Next, we looked at the newest report. The gross cost estimate is $1.762 trillion from 2012 through 2022.  

We found the 2012 number is not comparable to the 2010 figure.

First of all, the new report calculates costs over an 11-year span, not a decade as the 2010 report did.

Furthermore, it includes costs for nine years in which the health care law would be in full effect. The 2010 report covered only six years of full implementation.

A better comparison would be to look at costs for 2012 through 2019, the years covered by both reports. So that’s what PolitiFact National did.

In the CBO’s first estimate, the gross figure is $931 billion.

In the new estimate, the figure is $1.01 trillion.

That’s an increase of less than 9 percent.

This jump is far less than what Price’s numbers suggest. If the CBO’s estimate had truly changed to $1.76 trillion as his news release said, the plan’s costs would have nearly doubled.

PolitiFact National also considered what the projected cost of the health care overhaul would be if it took into account aspects of the plan that would pay for some of the care. It felt this ""net"" cost number would be a more complete portrayal of the plan’s costs.

It found that these net cost projections actually declined. The CBO’s 2010 estimate totaled $784 billion. The 2012 report revised it downward to $768 billion.

Price’s claim that the health care overhaul ""will cost $1.76 trillion over 10 years -- well above the $940 billion Democrats originally claimed"" uses numbers that are not comparable to make an incorrect assertion.

When you do the math correctly, the gross cost projection increased by less than 9 percent. The net cost estimate has actually dropped.  

Price’s claim is False.",/factchecks/2012/mar/27/tom-price/us-rep-price-health-care-bill-cost-projections-ros/
