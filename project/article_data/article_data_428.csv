Donald Trump Jr. says unemployment rates are manipulated for political purposes
","Are the unemployment numbers being manipulated to make the Obama administration look good? That was the contention of Donald Trump Jr., son of the Republican presidential nominee, during the July 24 edition of CNN's State of the Union. Trump was making a point frequently made by his father — that the official unemployment rate is lower than it should be because it doesn't take into account the people who would like a job but have stopped looking. ""The way we actually measure unemployment is after x number of months if someone can't find a job, congratulations, they're miraculously off,"" he said. ""That doesn't count"" in the calculation. ""These are artificial numbers,"" Trump continued. ""These are numbers that are massaged to make the existing economy look good, to make this administration look good when, in fact, it's a total disaster. ... Those are the people we want to put to work"" He's correct that the widely-reported unemployment number doesn't capture the full employment picture. But for this check, we'll talk about whether the numbers are massaged to make the economy look better than it is. We've looked at the issue before with Donald Trump Sr. when he claimed the ""real"" rate was 18 to 20 percent (False) or may be as high as 42 percent (Pants on Fire). The unemployment rate is developed by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based in part on data from interviews of about 60,000 households conducted by the Census Bureau  As Trump Jr. indicated, it only includes people who have recently looked for a job. But that's the way it's consistently been done for decades. Alternative methods have their own limitations. Allegations of manipulation When we asked for evidence that the numbers are distorted for political reasons, Trump campaign spokesman Dan Kowalski referred us to a 2013 New York Post story alleging that the Census Bureau ""faked"" the sharp drop in the September 2012 unemployment rate just prior to the election that gave Obama a second term. The story's only identified source was a Census employee, Julius Buckmon, who told the Post that his superiors had told him to make up interviews that serve as the basis for the statistic. Two problems: Buckmon had left the bureau by 2012, and he told the paper he was never told to sway the statistic in favor of Obama. As we reported in 2013, even a worker who made up interviews wouldn't be able to pull enough statistical weight to significantly affect the unemployment rate for any month. A typical worker handles data from 35 to 55 of the 60,000 or so households surveyed. And the bureau routinely double-checks its findings by having households re-interviewed by a different person in an attempt to look for inconsistencies that might point to manipulation. The Office of the Inspector General at the Commerce Department concluded in May 2014 that there was ""no evidence"" that the numbers had been manipulated in the runup to Obama's reelection, especially when other sources confirmed the trend. The report said: ""It would have taken 78 Census Bureau Field Representatives working together, in a coordinated way, to report each and every unemployed person included in their sample as 'employed' or 'not in labor force' during September 2012"" to produce that kind of manipulation. Since then, unemployment has continued to fall. Artificial numbers? Other experts joined Baker in dismissing the younger Trump’s allegation about the standard unemployment rate. ""The same basic definition of the unemployment rate has been used (with minor changes) going back almost all the way to World War II, under both Republican and Democratic administrations,"" said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. ""This measure has been consistently produced following the same basic methodology in the U.S. and copied around the world for over 50 years,"" said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University. And what about Trump's complaint that the numbers are skewed by not including people who have given up looking for work? Sinclair said the BLS tries to track that through a variation of the unemployment rate known as U-6, or the ""underutilization"" rate. This version includes people who have stopped looking for work but say they would start if the market improved, people working part-time because they can't get full-time work, along with the people included in the standard unemployment rate. By it's nature, the U-6 rate is higher. The June rate was 9.6 percent compared to the conventional unemployment rate of 4.9 percent. But that estimate has its limitations as well. It doesn’t count recent graduates who never entered the labor market in the first place because they feared there would be no jobs for them, and it doesn’t count people who chose to take care of their kids full-time, went back to school or retired early to avoid having to compete for a job. By that statistic, the economy is not as healthy as the conventional unemployment estimate would indicate. Casey Mulligan, professor of economics at the University of Chicago, said it's fair for the younger Trump to dispute the standard unemployment rate as an indicator of economic performance because the labor market has not gained the type of strength you would expect with the current unemployment rate. It's a question of which BLS data to use ""rather than the competence of the BLS per se,"" he said. But Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel said the important thing ""is to be consistent across time in which measure you use. It wouldn't be right to switch from looking at the conventional rate to a measure that includes discouraged workers just because you don't like the incumbent president and want to make things look bad for him."" Other experts were more blunt. Trump’s comment ""is a reprise of the same nonsense his father floated a few months ago. It is yet another conspiracy theory that the Trumps have grabbed onto,"" said Neil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor. The limitations of the unemployment number are well known, he said. ""Everyone who reads an article in a decent newspaper about the employment picture each month reads about discouraged workers, part-time workers, and so on."" ""There are plenty of grounds for us nerd-types to complain about the accuracy of the BLS numbers,"" said Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington. ""No survey is perfect and there will always be issues with how a survey is conducted and questions are posed. But the idea that BLS cooks numbers is beyond ridiculous."" Our ruling Trump Jr. said that unemployment numbers ""are artificial numbers. These are numbers that are massaged to make the existing economy look good, to make this administration look good when, in fact, it's a total disaster."" The economists with whom we spoke said Trump is wrong to question the integrity of the federal unemployment data. The method of developing the estimates have been used for decades, their limitations are widely recognized, other economic indicators have confirmed their reliability, and there's no evidence that they have been massaged for political purposes. Because his claim is in the realm of the ridiculous, we rate it Pants on Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5ff3b1f3-79ac-4f4e-bce9-8a10cc1ddcfa",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC826680>],/factchecks/2016/jul/25/donald-trump-jr/donald-trump-jr-says-unemployment-rates-are-manipu/

UNICEF: More girls in South Sudan die in childbirth than graduate from high school
","There are countries where the measures of well-being tell such a bleak story, you have to stop and verify them. South Sudan falls in that group. UNICEF, the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, marked the fifth year since this African nation separated from its northern neighbor with a photo essay about five children. One showed a little girl shyly smiling as she holds an oversized slate chalkboard bearing two perfectly legible number 5s. The caption read, ""Only about 10 percent of girls in South Sudan complete primary school, and the typical age of marriage in rural areas is rarely over 15. As a result, more teenage girls die in childbirth than finish high school."" South Sudan emerged as an independent country in 2011 after years of civil war. Its people barely had time to catch their collective breath before friction between two rival factions turned the country back into a battlefield again. The fighting has forced millions from their homes. Under these conditions, it’s plausible that more teenage girls dying in childbirth than graduate from high school, but every claim needs data behind it, and we went looking. Girls in South Sudan who finish high school Ongoing conflict has made education nearly impossible. A 2014 Brookings Institution article noted that ""approximately 50 percent of primary school-age children are currently not in school."" So how many girls finish high school? We can’t say for certain, but we know the number is quite low. The South Sudanese government reported that in 2013, just 730 girls were in the last year of secondary school out of a total population over 12 million. Girls in South Sudan who die in childbirth Finding a precise number of teenage girls in South Sudan who die during childbirth is more complicated because accurate data in a war zone is hard to come by. To get even a crude estimate, we had to rely on a couple of figures. First a 2008 survey of South Sudan found that about 10.3 percent of all women in the country were 15-19. That translates to about 610,000 teenage girls. A 2010 government health survey said that ""in South Sudan, one-third of the 15-19 year old women start childbearing."" That would mean about 207,000 young women are at risk of dying in childbirth. Based on UNICEF data, the nonprofit aid group International Medical Corps wrote that ""with 2,054 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, South Sudan has the highest maternal mortality rate in the world."" When we apply that rate to the number of young women at risk, we get over 4,000 deaths. That’s nearly six times the maximum number of female high school graduates. What experts say People and groups with on-the-ground experience in South Sudan said they have no reason to doubt UNICEF’s comparison. Lydia Stone, now with the British aid organization Social Development Direct, told us that ""while there is a dearth of reliable, recent data in South Sudan, this UNICEF claim is almost certainly true."" Stone said that most girls ""are married around the age of 15-16 some even younger. Their bodies are not ready to bear children and - outside of aid agencies - the health system is virtually non-existent."" Canada is a major donor of relief services in South Sudan. Global Affairs Department spokeswoman Jessica Seguin said ""South Sudanese girls’ face significant inequalities in terms of access to education, and are at a high risk of early and forced child marriage, and accompanying obstetric health problems."" In a 2012 field report, Stone wrote that the society puts a premium on women having as many children as possible. During the first civil war, government leaders cast pregnancy as a patriotic duty. But Stone wrote that in interviews, many women embraced their role quite apart from any overt pressure. ""One woman said, ‘There is no limit; if I can have 15 or 20, then I will. It is for God to decide.’"" Our ruling UNICEF wrote that in South Sudan, ""more teenage girls die in childbirth than finish high school."" The claim is almost certainly correct, experts say. But there is no single data source that can verify the comparison. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB979A40>],/factchecks/2016/jul/25/unicef/unicef-more-girls-south-sudan-die-childbirth-gradu/
"['National', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Hillary Clinton says Mike Pence 'slashed' education spending as Indiana governor
","Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both picked men with executive experience as their running mates. Mike Pence, Trump’s vice presidential pick, is the governor of Indiana, and Sen. Tim Kaine, running alongside Clinton, served as Virginia’s governor from 2006 to 2010. Clinton compared their gubernatorial records at a July 23 rally in Miami. ""While Mike Pence slashed education funding in Indiana and gave more tax cuts to the wealthiest, Tim Kaine cut his own salary and invested in education from pre-K through college and beyond,"" she said. There’s a lot to unpack in there. We were especially curious, though, about Clinton’s comparison of their education records. At the Republican National Convention, Pence said that as Indiana’s governor, he has made ""record investments in education,"" and we rated that claim Half True. We found that Clinton’s claim that Kaine ""invested"" in education while Pence ""slashed education funding"" is an exaggeration at best. Pence Indiana has not ""slashed"" education funding under Pence’s leadership. In fact, it’s been on the rise every year since Pence took office in 2013. Not adjusting for inflation, Indiana state spending for K-12 and higher education combined hit record highs in 2014 through the current year, according to data compiled by Larry DeBoer, a professor of agricultural economics at Indiana’s Purdue University. When adjusted for inflation, the rise isn’t so dramatic, but it’s still there. (For calculating the inflation-adjusted spending, DeBoer used 1982-84 dollars according to the Consumer Price Index.)  The Clinton campaign pointed out that Pence asked universities to cut their state spending by 2 percent in fiscal year 2014 to account for a revenue shortfall. And the 2015 state budget took money from some urban school districts and redistributed them to suburban districts, which some commentators saw as disproportionately benefiting wealthier students. Pence did, though, successfully push for $15 million to fund a preschool program for poor families. Kaine Education spending in Virginia actually went down under Kaine, who served as governor from 2006 through 2010. However, Kaine took office in a relatively healthy economy that soon gave way to the recession in 2007, which squeezed state budgets across the country. In raw dollars, state spending on K-12 and higher education under Kaine increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009, to a high of $7.5 billion, according to figures compiled by Chris Duncombe, a policy analyst at the Commonwealth Institute, a liberal Virginia think tank. There was a very slight dip in 2008 when adjusting the figures for inflation. Then in 2010, it fell to $6.8 billion, and that includes $365 million from the federal government to support the economic recovery.  The Clinton campaign said Kaine expanded pre-kindergarten programs, and he signed a 2006 bond bill that set out to provide $1.5 billion for construction projects at Virginia colleges and universities. The campaign also noted that in 2006, Kaine signed a bill to establish a framework for bringing Virginia teacher salaries up to the national average. However, the state ended up having to rescind a 2 percent raise for state employees and teachers before it went into effect in 2008 in the wake of the recession. ""Sen. Kaine was dealt a poor hand to fund public education, or anything else for that matter,"" said Richard Salmon, a professor emeritus and expert in public education at Virginia Tech. ""However, the funding reductions that befell public schools have not been attributed to Sen. Kaine by supporters of public education, and most feel that the reductions would have been even more severe if someone else had been governor,"" Salmon said. Salmon noted that public school funding still hasn’t fully recovered from the recession cuts. Our ruling Clinton said that unlike Tim Kaine, who ""invested"" in education in Virginia, Mike Pence ""slashed education funding"" in Indiana. The clear implication from Clinton’s statement is that Pence cut education in Indiana while Kaine grew it in Virginia. That sends voters an inaccurate message. Pence made various individual cuts and investments in education, but overall state spending has increased every year in his term so far. Kaine made notable investments in certain educational projects as Virginia’s governor, but state education spending shrunk overall throughout his term. However, this was primarily because the recession caused massive budget shortfalls. We rate Clinton’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d903da3f-8806-47e1-9b6e-b4d423291fe7",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB686C0>],/factchecks/2016/jul/24/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-mike-pence-slashed-education-/
"['Ethics', 'Virginia', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump wrong that Tim Kaine took more gifts than Bob McDonnell
","Donald Trump welcomed U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., to the Democratic presidential ticket on Sunday by assailing the presumptive vice presidential nominee’s ethics. Appearing on NBC’s Meet the Press, Trump said Kaine accepted more political gifts than former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell. That’s a big claim, because McDonnell, a Republican, stood trial for accepting $177,000 in undisclosed personal gifts from an entrepreneur who was seeking business with the state. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned McDonnell’s bribery convictions in June. ""Bob McDonnell took a fraction of what Kaine took,"" said Trump, the GOP presidential nominee. ""And I think, to me, it’s a big problem. Now, how do you take all these gifts? Hundreds of thousands of dollars."" We wondered whether McDonnell’s gift-taking was, in fact, ""a fraction"" of Kaine’s. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our request for proof. So we set out on our own, comparing gifts Kaine received as lieutenant governor and governor from 2002 to 2010 to those McDonnell accepted as attorney general from 2006 to 2009 and as governor from 2010 to 2014. During those years, Virginia didn’t limit gifts to its politicians; the only requirement was that officeholders disclose what they accepted. We researched the online files of the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonprofit organization that keeps records of campaign contributions and financial disclosure statements filed by state politicians. Kaine   According to VPAP, Kaine accepted $162,083 in gifts. Of that amount, $35,442 came when he was lieutenant governor from 2002 to 2006, and $126,641 came when he was governor the next four years. Most of the money was for political travel. The gifts include $45,000 that Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign paid for Kaine’s airline and lodging expenses as a surrogate speaker. Also on the list were $20,000 in travel reimbursements from Moving Virginia Forward, a PAC Kaine set up for political expenses. He listed another $11,000 in travel financed by the Democratic Party of Virginia. Kaine also accepted some personal gifts. The largest was use of a political donor’s home in the Caribbean for a vacation shortly after Kaine was elected governor in 2005. On a disclosure form, Kaine estimated the in-kind value of the lodging at $18,000. He also accepted $5,500 in clothing from Stuart Siegel, chairman of S&K Famous Brands Inc. And he accepted a variety of tickets to football and basketball games and even a concert by the Dave Matthews Band. All of these gifts were disclosed. There have been no allegations that Kaine accepted undisclosed gifts. McDonnell According to VPAP, McDonnell disclosed $275,707 in gifts. Of that amount, $60,293 came when he was attorney general, and $215,414 came when he was governor.   Some of the money was used for political travel, but it’s hard to get an idea of how much, because McDonnell did not consistently report the purpose for his travels. Some of the gifts also went to McDonnell’s enjoyment, including at least $34,000 in tickets and travel to Washington Redskins and University of Notre Dame football games. In addition, as we noted earlier, McDonnell and his family accepted $177,000 in undisclosed gifts and special loans from a businessman who was seeking the state’s help in marketing a dietary supplement. These gifts included a $6,000 Rolex watch; use of the businessman’s vacation home at Smith Mountain Lake; $15,000 for the catering bill at the wedding of McDonnell’s oldest daughter, as well as a $10,000 wedding check to her; and a designer gown for McDonnell’s wife. All told, McDonnell’s disclosed and undisclosed gifts come to $452,707. Our ruling Trump, speaking about gift-taking, said, ""Bob McDonnell took a fraction of what (Tim) Kaine took."" Kaine accepted $162,083 in gifts as lieutenant governor and governor, all of which was disclosed as required by state law. McDonnell disclosed accepting $275,707 in gifts as attorney general and governor. And there was another $177,000 that he didn’t disclose. That comes to a total of $452,707 in gifts - almost three times Kaine’s total. Trump has got this one dead wrong.

"['Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Clinton wrongly says she was only one in primaries to nix middle-class tax hikes
","Hillary Clinton came to Virginia recently, promising to expand early childhood education programs, make community colleges free and ensure that students can go to universities without assuming debt. ""People say to me, ‘OK, well how are you going to pay for it?’"" she said during a July 14 rally at Northern Virginia Community College in Annandale. ""Well, we’re going to go where the money is. That means we’re going to raise taxes on the wealthy and those who can afford to pay."" "" ... But I’ll tell you this,"" she added. ""I am the only candidate who ran in either primary who said, ‘I will not raise taxes on the middle class.’ And I mean that, and I won’t do it."" Clinton began making that promise last fall, saying she would not raise taxes on those earning less than $250,000 a year. We wondered whether she was, in fact, the only candidate in the heavily populated Democratic and Republican presidential primary fields to make a no-tax-hike pledge to the middle class. We found that 13 of the 17 GOP candidates made promises last year that were far more encompassing than Clinton’s. They vowed not to raise taxes on anyone - including the middle class. Twelve of them last year signed no-tax pledges with Americans for Tax Reform, a fiscally conservative group founded by Grover Norquist. They promised to ""oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses"" and ""any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates."" Last year’s 12 signers were Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Rick Santorum, John Kasich, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Jim Gilmore, George Pataki and Rick Perry. A 13th GOP candidate, Mike Huckabee, signed a personal oath last year to oppose all tax increases. Two other Republican candidates had signed an Americans for Tax Reform’s no-tax pledge before last year: Lindsey Graham and Scott Walker. So contrary to Clinton’s claim, 15 of the 17 GOP candidates had signed no-tax-hike pledges - not just the middle class but everyone. Who were the two resisters? •Donald Trump, the ultimate GOP nominee, who said last year he didn’t want to sign the Americans for Tax Reform pledge because he ""may want to switch taxes around."" The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington says that Trump’s proposals would cut federal levies on the middle one-fifth of taxpayers by 4.9 percent. •Jeb Bush, who said he objects to written pledges. We searched debate transcripts and a variety of websites for any specific promises by Trump or Bush to shield the middle class from tax hikes, but we came up empty. We made similar searches for the four Democrats who opposed Clinton during the primaries. While each of them spoke about the hardships facing the middle class, we found no evidence of them specifically promising to oppose tax increases on the middle class. We asked Clinton’s for an explanation of Clinton’s claim and got a generic response. ""Hillary Clinton’s policies, including her pledge not to raise taxes on the middle class, would build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top,"" Josh Schwerin, a campaign spokesman, replied in an email. Our ruling Clinton said, ""I am the only candidate who ran in either primary who said, ‘I will not raise taxes on the middle class.’"" Fifteen of the 17 Republican presidential candidates signed pledges not to raise taxes on anyone, which includes the middle class. Thirteen of those candidates signed the vow last year; the other three inked such a pledge earlier in their careers.

"['Military', 'Texas', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump claims military jets need salvage parts
","""Trump Force One,"" as Donald Trump’s Boeing 757 has been nicknamed, has drawn attention for years. A 2011 tour of the renovated jet, posted on Trump’s YouTube channel, has been viewed more than 8 million times. Its 24-karat gold-plated seat belts have been catalogued by the New York Times and the Washington Post. But does Trump know his stuff when it comes to the state of U.S. military aviation? At a June 16, 2016 stop in Dallas during a Trump fundraising swing through Texas, he ripped into U.S. reliance on outdated aircraft while selling newer technology to allies, telling the crowd: ""Remember, we’re the ones with the jet fighters that are 20 years old that we have to go to graveyards, plane graveyards, to get parts to use on our jet fighters, to have our great young people to fly in planes where  they go into junk yards and museums to get parts for current fighters, while our opponents and our so-called allies are buying our planes, and they’ve got the new beautiful versions of them, and we’ve got old planes, I mean literally obsolete planes. It’s not going to happen anymore, folks, ok?"" The comments made us wonder — is the U.S. military really scrounging for parts in junkyards and museums? Are our jets really decades old? And do we sell newer and better planes to our allies while keeping older, inferior versions for ourselves? The Trump campaign did not return a request for backup for Trump’s claim, and the Air Force did not respond to repeated requests for comment, so we did some searching and asked a few third-party experts for information on Trump’s points. As it turns out, it’s true that some of U.S. military planes are 20 years old — and some are much older. Contacted by email, Carl Rhodes, director of Force Modernization and Employment Program at RAND Project AIR FORCE, a federally funded research and development center that provides analytical support to the Air Force, told us ""some are over 60 years old like the B-52"" while ""others are brand new, like the F-22 and F-35."" At a Feb. 9, 2016, news conference, Major General James F. Martin Jr., the Air Force deputy assistant secretary for budget, said the average age of its aircraft is over 27. The Air Force Posture Statement for fiscal year 2017, released on February 10, 2016, states that makes the current fleet the oldest ever: ""While our Airmen remain heavily engaged around the world, the average age of our aircraft is at an all-time high, and the size of our force and state of our full-spectrum readiness are at or near all-time lows."" So, Trump has a point about the U.S. Air Force relying on older planes. To our inquiry, Rhodes also confirmed that Air Force maintenance workers pull parts from warehoused planes, directing us to a Jan. 30, 2013 news feature story in AIRMAN, published by the Air Force Office of Public Affairs. According to the story, reclamation teams with the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group save time and money by pulling parts that are still functional from shelved  planes, sparing the Air Force from waiting longer for new parts to be made. According to a fact sheet we spotted on the Air Force’s website, since 1964, U.S. military aircraft have been stored and disposed of by Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. Davis-Monthan was first established as an aircraft storage facility following World War II. According to a February 4, 2003 PBS story, the practice of removing parts from the junked planes dates to the 1950s. So, must the government go to ""graveyards"" to get parts? ""Probably not,"" Rhodes told us, ""but it can save quite a bit of money versus buying all new parts and keeping a sufficient stockpile."" How much money, exactly? Col. Robert Lepper, Commander of the 309th AMARG, told an Arizona news service in 2014 that the group returns about a half billion dollars worth of parts into service each year. Rhodes also offered an example that supports Trump’s claim that in some cases, the U.S. sells planes more advanced than the ones they themselves are using. ""We are selling F-16s to the UAE which are more advanced than our USAF F-16s,"" he said. Rhodes pointed us to a January 2014 news post on Defense Industry Daily, a trade publication focused on defense acquisition, stating the United Arab Emirates invested $3 billion in research to develop the planes, which are made by Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin, the number one US government contractor overall and within the Air Force sub-sector in fiscal year 2015, reported about 20% of their annual sales revenue came from sales to foreign entities, according to their SEC filings from 2010. Their filings report aircraft sales to countries including Israel, Kuwait, South Korea, and Tunisia. Over 25 countries purchased Lockheed Martin’s F-16 Fighting Falcon, and 15 have purchased the C-130J Super Hercules. Boeing is the number two Air Space contractor. Some 62% of Boeing’s Defense, Space and Security Revenue comes from the U.S. Department of Defense, according to the company’s 2015 annual report. International customers account for ""roughly one-third of revenue and 40 percent of current backlog"" for the company. International sales account for a much smaller portion of the sales of the number three company, Northrop Grumman, according to their annual report -- 14 percent of the $23.5 billion total. The U.S. government’s own Defense Security Cooperation Agency’s web site acknowledges an uptick in foreign demand, noting in a 2014 publication, ""While the United States and European Union are cutting their defense expenditures, several countries — particularly in East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and South America — are increasing expenditures. Hence, U.S. Contractors are increasingly seeking to sell products and services to these markets."" But experts we spoke to said that selling planes to other nations isn’t relevant to the state of our own military aviation. Todd Harrison, director of Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, commented by email: ""The fact that U.S. companies are selling planes to other countries is not relevant. Those same companies are also selling planes to the U.S. military right now, and in many cases the U.S. is getting significantly better aircraft than our allies and partners. And what would the alternative be — block U.S. companies from selling aircraft to others?  Then our allies and partners would be less capable and even more dependent on us for security, putting an even greater strain on our forces."" Obaid Younossi, director of resource management at RAND Project AIR FORCE, agreed by email that foreign military sales are a plus for the U.S. ""We still make and keep the best of best for us: F-22, F-35, KC-46, F/A-18E/F, E-2D, and P-8. There are certainly versions of F-35 and F-18E/F we sell to our allies, but the vast majority of what is coming out of production is for our Services,"" Younossi wrote. ""FMS [Foreign Military Sales] is good not only for strategic reasons but also for economic reasons.  It keeps costs down for us, keeps our industrial base in business, and helps pay for development of technology (i.e. F-16 Block 60 and Kuwaiti investments),"" Younossi said. ""Do we need to worry about modernization?,"" Younossi wrote, adding: ""Yes but not for reasons cited.  Some of the old work horses can still do the job but we need new ones to counter future threats."" In October 2015, the Pentagon awarded a contract to Northrop Grumman Corp. to build the first new bombers since the Cold War, which are to be deployed in the 2020s. Since Trump assured his audience ""it’s not going to happen anymore, folks,"" it’s worth noting that updating the military’s aging fleet isn’t the kind of job that can be done overnight — nor is it fully within the hands of the executive branch, as funding levels, determined by Congress, have contributed to readiness problems. according to Air Force officials like Chief of Staff Mark Welsh and Secretary Deborah Lee James.. Our ruling While in Texas, Trump said the U.S. has to go to ""plane graveyards"" and museums to get parts for its 20-year-old jet fighters while it sells new jets to other countries. The government indeed salvages parts for military planes remaining in action and the U.S. also sells aircraft to militaries abroad. But clarification is needed. The described parts salvaging, which can save time and money, doesn’t appear to be misguided and the U.S. also buys new planes for its forces. We rate this claim Mostly True.

Pants on Fire for claim Ted Cruz never denied father photographed with Lee Harvey Oswald
","Donald Trump, fresh off triumphantly accepting the Republican presidential nomination in Cleveland, surprisingly revived an explosive unfounded tale related to someone with no chance of beating him in November. The day after the 2016 Republican National Convention, Trump said his vanquished Republican rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, had never denied that his father was in a 1963 photo with Lee Harvey Oswald, who went on to assassinate President John F. Kennedy that November. At a rally, Trump initially told supporters he doesn’t want the backing of Cruz, whose convention speech two days earlier drew boos for not including a Trump endorsement; the Texan did offer congratulations. Next, Trump resurrected his unconfirmed claim about Oswald and Rafael Cruz, the senator’s father, possibly knowing one another. Trump said: ""All I did is point out the fact that on the cover of the National Enquirer there was a picture of him and crazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast. Now, Ted never denied that it was his father. Instead he said, ‘Donald Trump.’ I had nothing to do with it. This was a magazine that frankly, in many respects, should be very respected."" In May 2016, PolitiFact found incorrect and ridiculous--Pants on Fire--Trump’s claim that Cruz’s father was with Oswald before Kennedy’s assassination. There was no evidence the man next to Oswald in the black-and-white photo published in the Enquirer was the elder Cruz. Notably, facial recognition experts advised that no such match could be made; meantime, historians found no corroborating records. The Enquirer never said how it determined the man in the photo with Oswald was Rafael Cruz. Could it still be that Sen. Cruz never denied his father was in the photo? To our inquiry on this point, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed out a statement the Cruz campaign gave to the McClatchy News Service in April 2016 at the time the photo in question was printed on the Enquirer’s cover.   The Cruz campaign’s communications director, Alice Stewart, said then: ""The story is false; that is not Rafael in the picture,""according to the Miami Herald’s April 22, 2016 news story. Stewart’s ""not Rafael"" declaration appears to have gotten play. We found it in stories or web posts on the McClatchy website and for the conservative web network The Blaze plus in the International Business Times, on the FactCheck.org fact-checking site and on sites for Yahoo! News, The Hill, Gawker, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. Trump first cited the Enquirer article during a May 3, 2016, telephone interview with the Fox News program, Fox and Friends. Later that day, at an Indiana campaign event, Cruz spoke to reporters, saying: ""This morning Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Let’s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position, this is just kooky."" Cruz said the Enquirer ""just spread lies, blatant lies"" and described the article as ""this idiotic story about JFK."" Also,  on May 3, 2016, Ben Jacobs, political reporter for the Guardian, tweeted a statement regarding the claim that Jacobs generally attributed to the Cruz campaign. It said: ""It’s embarrassing that anyone would enable Trump to discuss this. It’s a garbage story and clearly Donald wants to talk about garbage."" The same day, Rafael Cruz told ABC News in a TV interview that the links insinuated between him and Oswald were ""ludicrous."" ""I was never in New Orleans at that time,"" he said. Our ruling Trump said the day after the Republican convention that Cruz ""never denied"" his father was pictured with Oswald before Kennedy’s assassination. This spring, Cruz called the National Enquirer story ""lies.""  Earlier, a Cruz camp spokeswoman said outright the elder Cruz wasn’t in the published photo. That's far enough from ""never denied,"" it makes Trump's claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

"['Jobs', 'New York', 'Andrew Cuomo']","
New York has more private sector jobs than ever before
","During a press briefing in Ontario County earlier this month, Cuomo touted New York State’s economy. He cited labor force numbers when asked about a report on the START-UP NY program. The program produced fewer jobs in the past year than some would have liked. ""You know that the economic development projects are working very well, and you know the economic development policy of the state is working very well because it’s in the numbers,"" Cuomo said. ""This is all you need to know.  We created 800,000 new jobs. We cut the unemployment rate almost in half. And, today New York State has more private sector jobs than it has ever had in its history, period, game over. It's working,"" Cuomo said. During a time when voters are split on the state’s direction, we checked the numbers to find out if Cuomo’s claim checks out. 800,000 new jobs Cuomo’s office says the 800,000 new jobs refers to those added in the private sector since he took office in 2011. New York State had 7,094,300 jobs in the private sector the month before Cuomo began his first term, according to the state Department of Labor. Since then, employment has mostly gone up each month, with the exception of nine months scattered across his two terms as governor. The latest number from the Department of Labor showed 7,889,000 private sector jobs as of May 2016. That’s just below 795,000 additional jobs in the private sector since Cuomo’s first month in office. So that part of his claim checks out. Cutting unemployment in half Cuomo’s claim about the unemployment rate being cut ""almost in half"" also refers to time since he took office in 2011. When he entered office, the statewide unemployment rate was 8.4 percent. That includes New York City, Long Island and the rest of the state. Although unemployment steadily climbed from 2011 to 2012, the governor correctly claims the unemployment rate is lower since he took office. By May, the unemployment rate had dropped to 4.7 percent, almost half what it was when Cuomo took office. More private sector jobs than ever Cuomo also claimed New York State had more private sector jobs than ever before in the state’s history. Much like the state’s population, the workforce has inched up over time. The state seasonally adjusts its jobs report, taking into account seasonal jobs like construction work in the summer and retail employment during the holiday season at the end of the year. Before Cuomo took office, the number of private sector jobs peaked at nearly 7.3 million in April 2008, when David Paterson served as governor. The nearly 7.9 million such jobs in May, as reported by the Labor Department, shows Cuomo’s claim to be true. There are now more private sector jobs in New York State than there has ever been before. There are also more people living in New York State than ever before, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. So the labor force has grown over time as well. Our ruling During a press briefing in Ontario County, Gov. Cuomo told a group of reporters that 800,000 jobs had been created, the unemployment rate fell by almost half, and the state had more private sector jobs than ever before. We reviewed data from the Department of Labor to check Cuomo’s claim. We rate it to be True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/25db535b-412c-4788-bbcd-ce9660d5c1e9",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7EB800>],/factchecks/2016/jul/22/andrew-cuomo/new-york-has-more-private-sector-jobs-ever/

At GOP national convention, Ron Johnson attacks challenger Russ Feingold's support for the military
","U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson used part of his July 19, 2016, speech at the Republican National Convention to boost his re-election campaign, attacking challenger and ex-senator Russ Feingold for voting ""against authorizing our military 11 separate times."" It’s a claim we want to check, given that Johnson made it in the context of arguing that electing Feingold would made America less safe. But first a little on how the Wisconsin Republican got there. The attack Johnson opened his speech in Cleveland with this greeting: ""Ladies and gentleman, what difference, at this point, does it make?"" It was a shot at Hillary Clinton. While secretary of state, Clinton uttered that phrase to him during a Senate hearing on the bombing of the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Four Americans died in the Sept. 11, 2012 attack. (Our In Context on Clinton’s remarks is one of our most-clicked items. And PolitiFact National rated as Mostly True another claim from the speech in which Johnson took credit for inducing Clinton’s comments.) After criticizing the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Johnson continued his speech by warning of dangers posed by terrorism if Democrats win in the November 2016 elections. Then he pivoted to attacking Feingold, a Democrat who served three terms in the Senate before Johnson defeated him in 2010. ""So, the question is, when will America actually confront this terrible reality. We certainly won’t, if Democrats win in November,"" Johnson said. ""In Wisconsin, I’m running against Russ Feingold, a man who even after 9/11, was the only senator to vote against giving law enforcement the tools they need to help stop international terror. During his 18-year Senate career, he also voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times."" During his current campaign, Feingold has defended, and raised money on, casting the only vote against the Patriot Act in 2001. He said the law ""gave the federal government way too much power to spy on people without adequate oversight."" But in the context of Johnson’s remarks about terrorism and being tough on defense, what does it mean that Feingold ""voted against authorizing our military""? In short, Johnson is making an attack that is broader than a claim about 11 votes. Understanding the NDAA To back Johnson’s statement, which is also made in a Johnson TV ad, his campaign staff cited 11 instances in which Feingold voted against the National Defense Authorization Act. But here are two key points made by three experts on defense budgets about NDAA votes: 1. The annual NDAA contains thousands of pages and hundreds of provisions, which means a lawmaker might vote against it for any number of reasons. Some lawmakers think it doesn’t authorize enough funds, others might think it authorizes too much; or a no vote could come from opposition to a policy in the bill, such as gays in the military or moving detainees out of Guantanamo Bay. ""Even if you’re the biggest proponent of a strong defense, you could find something to object to in the NDAA almost every year,"" said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a centrist think tank. 2. The NDAA authorizes funds, but it doesn’t provide any. Money is actually allocated through a separate appropriations process. So, voting no on an NDAA would not result in any shutdown, like voting no on appropriations could. Indeed, some federal agencies operate for years without an authorization bill. ""An authorization is just a license to hunt, it doesn’t actually bag you a deer,"" said  Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a public spending watchdog group. We also found that although Feingold sometimes was among only a small number of Democrats voting against an NDAA, often he was joined by conservative Republicans: 1993: 22 senators voted no, including Republican stalwarts Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Vietnam war veteran John McCain of Arizona, the GOP’s 2008 presidential nominee. 1994: Feingold was joined by McCain and another war veteran, Bob Dole of Kansas, the GOP’s 1996 president nominee, voting no. 2009: Feingold was the only Senate Democrat to vote against the NDAA. But 28 Republicans, including conservative stalwarts such as Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the current Senate majority leader, and Jeff Sessions of Arizona, also voted no. Feingold has given different reasons for his no votes. In 2008, for example, he said he supported a number of provisions in the NDAA, including a pay raise for troops and limiting the outsourcing of private security functions in war zones, but voted no because it contained ""$70 billion to continue the war in Iraq but no language mandating that we safely redeploy our troops."" It's also worth noting that Feingold did vote yes on a number of NDAAs, including in November 2005, June 2006 and December 2010, just before he left office. Our rating Johnson argued that Feingold would be weak on defense, and claimed that as a senator, Feingold ""voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times."" During his 18 years in the Senate, Feingold did vote 11 times against the National Defense Authorization Act, an annual bill that authorizes defense spending levels and covers policy issues such as gays in the military. The 11 votes indicate a pretty clear pattern. But those were not votes to defund the military, given that appropriations bills provide funding. And experts told us conclusions can’t be drawn about why a lawmaker votes no on the NDAA, given that sometimes lawmakers oppose it because of certain policy provisions. Moreover, lawmakers on both ends of the political spectrum, including ex-military conservative Republicans, have voted against it over the years. For a statement that is partially accurate, we rate Johnson’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECD01340>],/factchecks/2016/jul/22/ron-johnson/gop-national-convention-ron-johnson-attacks-challe/

Trump: Nearly '180,000 illegal immigrants' have criminal records but haven't been deported
","Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told the American public that beginning Jan. 20, 2017, safety will be restored. That means putting an end to violence and crime afflicting the nation, he said. There are immigrants in the country illegally who are out endangering communities, Trump added. ""Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens,"" Trump said in his nomination acceptance speech Thursday. We looked into that number to find out if that many convicted immigrants with deportations are out on the streets. Trump’s campaign said his statement came from a June 2016 report from the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors more strict immigration policies. The Center for Immigration Studies, in turn, relied on data obtained by the Senate Judiciary Committee. According to CIS, there were more than 925,000 immigrants who had been ordered removed but were still in the country as of July 2015. And an estimated 20 percent of them had at least one criminal conviction — nearly all of whom were at large. So Trump’s numbers are correct. But experts say there is some important context. Ana Gonzalez-Barrera, a senior researcher at Pew Research Center, said the figure includes immigrants from countries that won’t accept them back. ""In these cases, the immigrants have to be released after they have completed their sentences,"" Gonzalez-Barrera said. And in yet other instances, state and local jurisdictions have passed policies limiting cooperation with immigration authorities so they don’t notify them when a deportable noncitizen has completed a jail term or prison sentence, said Michelle Mittelstadt, communications director of the Migration Policy Institute. Jennifer Elzea, spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, says ICE makes custody determinations on a case-by-case basis, ""considering all the merits and factors of each case while adhering to current agency priorities, guidelines and legal mandates."" ""Those who are not subject to mandatory detention and do not pose a threat to the community may be placed on some form of supervision as an alternative to detention while awaiting their immigration court hearing,"" Elzea said. Still, Center for Immigration Studies points to a February 2016 ICE report showing that from fiscal year 2010 through July 21, 2015, 124 criminal immigrants released from ICE custody were subsequently charged with homicide-related crimes.
  Our ruling Trump said ""nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.""

Donald Trump correct — Lyndon Johnson passed legislation limiting political activity of churches
","In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, presidential candidate Donald Trump singled out ""the evangelical and religious community"" for their assistance in getting him nominated. ""They have much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits,"" he said. ""An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away,"" Trump said. ""I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans."" We were curious about the issue and whether an amendment — constitutional or otherwise — prevents the practice for religious institutions. For this fact-check, we're relying largely scholarly articles in the Denver University Law Review, the Case Western Reserve Law Review, Boston College Law Review. The restriction is actually a law, not an amendment, and it isn't exclusive to religious institutions. Lyndon Johnson is best known as America's 36th president, the Texan who assumed the office when John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Texas politics can be rough, and Johnson knew how to play that game. Therein lies the origin of the ""Johnson amendment."" The restriction was championed by LBJ in 1954 when Johnson was a U.S. senator running for re-election. A conservative nonprofit group that wanted to limit the treaty-making ability of the president produced material that called for electing his primary opponent, millionaire rancher-oilman Dudley Dougherty, and defeating Johnson. There was no church involved. Johnson, then Democratic minority leader, responded by introducing an amendment to Section 501(c)(3) of the federal tax code dealing with tax-exempt charitable organizations, including groups organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literacy and educational purposes, or to prevent cruelty to children or animals. It said, in effect, that if you want to be absolved from paying taxes, you couldn't be involved in partisan politics. There was no record of any debate around the amendment. ""The logical argument favoring such an amendment is that those corporations qualifying for the section 501(c)(3) tax subsidy should not be permitted to directly or indirectly use that subsidy to support candidates for office,"" said Michael Hone in the Case Western article. However it was likely, he said, that ""Johnson was motivated by a desire to exact revenge on the foundation he believed supported his opponent and to prevent it and other nonprofit corporations from acting similarly in the future."" Nonetheless, ""Subsequently it proved to have a profound effect on how thousands of tax-exempt organizations — including churches — dealt with issues relating to political campaigns,"" according to Patrick O'Daniel of the University of Texas School of Law in the Boston College article. The law says all such organizations ""are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office."" That includes contributions to political campaigns and any form of public statement for or against a candidate or group of candidates. Violating the restriction could result in the revocation of the organization's tax exempt status and the imposition of taxes. Nonpartisan, unbiased voter education or similar activities such as church-organized voter registration drives are allowed. Historically, that hasn't stopped some religious organizations from issuing endorsements anyway. O'Daniel has a list of examples. To cite two from 2000: Rev. Jerry Falwell told worshippers at the Genoa Baptist Church in Ohio to ""vote for the Bush of your choice"" and ""We simply have to beat (Al) Gore."" That same year, a pastor at a Bronx church who supported Hillary Clinton's run for the U.S. Senate at the time, substituted her opponent's name for Satan during a hymn. ""In the face of lackluster opposition by the Internal Revenue Service, the Democrats and Republicans . . . continue to use the literal bully pulpits of the churches to preach to the party faithful,"" O'Daniel wrote. Nonetheless, the threat of losing tax-exempt status persists as long as the law is in place, and politically-minded religious groups, particularly evangelicals, have regarded it as a suppression of free speech and an entanglement of the IRS in the operation of their religion. In 2008, for example, pastors in 20 states organized to give politically-oriented sermons to protest the law, according to the Pew Research Center. The GOP platform has picked up that cudgel, calling for the repeal of that portion of the tax law. The Johnson amendment survived court challenges in 1983, 1990 and 2000, according to Pew. Our ruling Trump said, ""An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views."" Trump is correct that the law was pushed by Johnson and that religious groups that advocate for candidates risk losing their tax exempt status. It's important to note that the prohibition is not just restricted to religious institutions. It's nonprofit charitable organizations in general. But overall, we rate the statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACBE1C0>],/factchecks/2016/jul/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-correct-lyndon-johnson-passed-legisla/

Trump tweaks talking point about U.S. being 'one of' highest-taxed nations, but it's still flawed
","Donald Trump tweaked one of his most repeated falsehoods as he accepted the Republican nomination for president. On the final night of the Republican National Convention, Trump positioned himself as the fiscally sound counter to rival and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, whom he claimed is proposing a tax hike. ""Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone, I mean everyone,"" Trump said. ""America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it'll happen and it'll happen fast."" This is the fourth time we’ve weighed in on a statement from Trump about America’s tax rate. The difference tonight is the slightly tempered tone. Instead of declaring the United States as having the highest tax rate, he said we’re one of the highest-taxed countries. That’s progress. But it’s still not 100 percent accurate. Back in May, Trump said, ""We’re the highest-taxed nation in the world."" We rated that False because, according to the Pew Research Center last year, America is slightly behind the middle of the pack when it comes to the taxed revenue portion of gross domestic product.  Raj Shah, a Republican National Committee spokesman, told PolitiFact that Trump was talking about the corporate tax rate. Trump didn’t specify that distinction in his speech, though his tax-rate claim was immediately followed by the business-specific line about reducing taxes that will spur growth of new companies and jobs. We’ve previously fact-checked a statement about whether the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world, and found it pretty accurate. Of the most advanced and industrialized nations in the world, America ranks third highest for general top marginal corporate income tax rates with a 39.1 percent tax on corporate profits, exceeded by Chad and the United Arab Emirates. So the United States does have a higher corporate tax rate than most of its industrialized peers. That said, it’s worth remembering that the official tax rates are one thing, while the tax rates corporations actually pay can be substantially less. In practice, U.S. companies pay less because they can claim deductions and exclusions. Trump teed up his statement by mentioning the tax impact on ""middle-income Americans and businesses,"" which could easily lead listeners to perceive this as a question of overall tax burden, not businesses specifically. Our rating Trump called the United States ""one of the highest-taxed nations in the world."" Trump tweaked his language this time in effort to improve his accuracy, saying it’s ""one of"" the highest taxed nations. If you believe that he meant the corporate tax rate, given the details about companies and jobs that followed the claim, then Trump’s comment is pretty accurate. However, he didn’t specify that distinction, and a reasonable listener could take away from Trump’s remark that he meant taxes overall, particularly given that he set up the line with a joint reference to middle-income Americans and businesses. We rate the claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8860395-ac6d-4568-be87-4971393efacb",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB0E280>],/factchecks/2016/jul/22/donald-trump/trumps-claim-us-taxes-tweaked/

Donald Trump is largely right that household incomes are down $4,000 since 2000
","Donald Trump assailed the health of the United States economy in his acceptance speech Thursday at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. ""What about our economy?"" he asked, rattling off a series of statistics. ""Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely. Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. That’s 16 years ago."" Here, we’ll focus on the final part of that statement -- that household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. On the numbers, Trump is right. Once you adjust for inflation, median household income fell from $57,724 in 2000 to $53,657 in 2014, the last full year for which data is available. That’s a decline of $4,067 -- in line with what Trump said. This chart shows the trend since 2000.  However, it’s worth noting one bit of context. While this statistic came amid a series of shots at President Barack Obama, the majority of the period Trump was referring to came under the presidency of George W. Bush, a Republican. During the first eight years of the span Trump referred to -- 2000 to 2008 -- Bush was president. And during Bush’s tenure, inflation-adjusted median household income declined by $2,411, which is more than half the total amount it fell between 2000 and 2014. Since Obama took office, it has fallen by $1,656. That’s not a great legacy, but it’s worth remembering that slicing the numbers this way puts all of the Great Recession on Obama’s watch while also denying Obama 2015, when there was a slow but steady recovery, because data is not available. Our ruling Trump said, ""Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000."" He’s right on the number. However, for a statistic embedded in a series of attacks on Obama, it exaggerates the income trend under the current president. A majority of the decline in real household income since 2000 actually occurred under a Republican president.

No, the East Coast gas shortage isn’t related to the Keystone Pipeline or Biden’s order
","A fuel shortage hit the East Coast on May 7 after the Colonial Pipeline was shut down following a cyberattack, but some people on social media blamed the fuel woes on President Joe Biden’s order halting construction of the Keystone XL pipeline project in the Great Plains. ""When you can't find gas, remember who executively ordered the Keystone Pipeline to close,"" a Facebook post read on May 10. Similar claims linking the Colonial and Keystone pipeline issues have been made elsewhere on Facebook and by politicians on Twitter, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif, and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post gets a few things wrong. First, Biden’s order didn’t close the Keystone Pipeline; it’s still operating. Second, Keystone doesn’t supply gasoline; it carries Canadian crude oil to U.S. refineries. Third, the gasoline shortages are due to a problem with the operator of the Colonial Pipeline, not a lack of crude oil — or anything connected with Keystone or Keystone XL. The Colonial Pipeline, which runs for 5,500 miles from Houston to New Jersey, supplies the East Coast with 45% of its gasoline. When a ransomware attack targeted the computer network of the Georgia-based company that operates the pipeline, the company decided to halt all operations in order to contain the attack. The temporary shutdown of the pipeline resulted in fuel shortages and price hikes throughout the East Coast. Keystone XL would have been an extension to the still operational Keystone Pipeline, which stretches for 2,687 miles from Hardisty, Alberta, in Canada to Illinois and Texas. The extension would have created another to carry crude oil from Alberta to U.S. refineries and terminals and expanded the network’s capacity. Construction on the Keystone XL project began on April 7, 2020, and less than 100 miles of the 1,179-mile extension was completed by the time  President Biden issued an executive order revoking the construction permit on Jan. 20, 2021. Even if the permit wasn’t revoked, Keystone XL could not have helped solve the problem created by the attack on the Colonial Pipeline. Keystone XL would’ve helped carry more crude oil to refineries in Illinois and Texas. The Colonial Pipeline transports oil that has already been refined into usable fuel.  The U.S. State Department told PolitiFact in 2017 that oil supplies coming through Keystone XL would have a minimal impact on fuel prices in the United States.  A Facebook post suggests that shortages of gasoline are due to an executive order closing the Keystone pipeline. The post is not accurate. Biden’s executive order halted construction on Keystone XL, an extension to the Keystone pipeline, but did not not close the Keystone pipeline, which is still operating.  The Keystone pipeline does not carry gasoline. It carries crude oil to refineries and terminals.  The gasoline shortages and price spikes on the East Coast are due to the temporary shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline, whose operator was targeted in a cyberattack on May 7. They are not due to a shortage of crude oil. There’s no connection between Biden’s Keystone XL order and the supply shortages that resulted from the Colonial Pipeline attack.

No, electric cars weren’t abandoned because batteries too costly to replace
","A viral Facebook post that questions whether ""we need to go green"" shows rows of electric cars in a field in France, and claims the runty two-doors were abandoned simply because their batteries had worn out and were too expensive to replace. The post, which features photographs of what appear to be dozens of identical vehicles, says: ""This is a boneyard near Paris, France with hundreds of electric powered cars. Mind you these are only cars used by the City of Paris and not personal vehicles. All of these have the same issue .... the battery storage cells have given out and need (to be) replaced. Why not just replace them you ask? Well two reasons. First the battery storage cells cost almost double what the vehicle cost new, and second no landfill or disposals will allow the batteries to be disposed of there. So these green fairy tale electric cars are all sitting in vacant lots while their batteries drain toxins into the ground. Still think we need to go green??? Very interesting.""",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6B6AC0>],/factchecks/2021/may/17/facebook-posts/no-electric-cars-werent-abandoned-because-batterie/

COVID-19 can be transmitted by people without symptoms
","After more than a year of advising strict COVID-19 safety guidelines, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced May 14 that fully vaccinated individuals can resume most regular activities without wearing masks or social distancing.  Many people, including President Joe Biden, viewed the news as a positive sign, but some social media users interpreted the change differently.  ""This week we learned the CDC lied about outdoor transmission, which helped shape COVID prevention measures across states,"" reads one Instagram post. ""What makes anyone think they haven’t lied about almost everything including transmission by asymptotic people, aka healthy people."" The caption on the post — which again erroneously uses the mathematical term ""asymptotic"" instead of the medical term ""asymptomatic"" — continues: ""Transmission by asymptotic people has never been proven, which is how they shaped the entire policy around this issue.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Setting aside the improper terminology, the post’s claim is false. Studies have found that COVID-19 can be spread by people who are asymptomatic and do not show any symptoms of the disease.  In a June 2020 interview on ""Good Morning America,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, estimated that 25% to 45% of ""of the totality of infected people likely are without symptoms."" During the same interview, Fauci said, ""we know from epidemiological studies"" that asymptomatic people can transmit the virus ""to someone who is uninfected even when they’re without symptoms."" While not all researchers agree on exactly how or how frequently asymptomatic transmission happens, multiple studies have concluded that it does happen.  A study conducted in Singapore from January to March 2020 found that presymptomatic transmission was responsible for several clusters of COVID-19 cases. For the purposes of the study, presymptomatic transmission was defined as ""the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected person (source patient) to a secondary patient before the source patient developed symptoms ...with no evidence that the secondary patient had been exposed to anyone else with COVID-19."" Another study conducted at a skilled nursing facility in Washington found that ""live coronavirus clearly sheds at high concentrations from the nasal cavity even before symptom development. Experts who analyzed the study concluded that the results indicated ""that asymptomatic persons are playing a major role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2."" Additional studies in The Journal of the American Medical Association, Science China Life Sciences, PLOS Medicine and Clinical Microbiology and Infection reaffirmed that asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 occurs — though they generally conclude that it occurs less frequently than symptomatic or presymptomatic transmission.  The updated CDC guidance is for vaccinated people. The CDC explained the change on its website: ""A growing body of evidence suggests that fully vaccinated people are less likely to have asymptomatic infection and potentially less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others. However, further investigation is ongoing."" The CDC also cited a broader need to encourage vaccination in its rationale for changing masking and social distancing requirements for fully vaccinated people. It referenced a January 2021 Kaiser Family Foundation survey about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. ""Maintaining a requirement to continue all prevention measures after vaccination may disincentivize vaccine uptake,"" the CDC’s website says. ""In a survey from January 2021, one in five people reported being less likely to get vaccinated if they heard that they will need to continue to wear a mask and practice social distancing even after getting vaccinated."" An Instagram post claimed that transmission of COVID-19 by people who are asymptomatic ""has never been proven."" Multiple studies have found that asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 occurs, though there is no consensus on how or how often it happens.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EA9F99C0>],/factchecks/2021/may/17/instagram-posts/covid-19-can-be-transmitted-people-without-symptom/

"['Elections', 'Kevin McCarthy']","
Ignoring claims from his own party, Kevin McCarthy says no one questions Biden’s election
","After meeting with President Joe Biden about infrastructure, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., walked out of the White House and immediately faced questions about his ability to work with Biden. A reporter asked McCarthy whether finding common ground with Biden would be complicated, since ""you’re about to elevate someone to a leadership position who is still questioning the legitimacy of the 2020 election results."" The reference was to Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., whom McCarthy had endorsed to be the next Republican conference chair, after Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who rejects former President Donald Trump’s false claims of election fraud, was forced out of the position by her fellow House Republicans. McCarthy said it would be up to the Republican conference to decide on Cheney’s replacement. He added: ""I don't think anybody is questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election. I think that is all over with. We’re sitting here with the president today. So from that point of view, I don’t think that’s a problem."" (Republicans voted Stefanik to the leadership role on May 14.) Election officials at county, state and federal levels have said that the 2020 election was secure and that there was no widespread fraud. States certified that Biden properly won the election and Congress, following a constitutional process, also certified their validity. Yet McCarthy’s May 12 claim that the legitimacy of Biden’s victory hasn’t been questioned is wrong — many Republican lawmakers have done so. Some have cited ""irregularities"" and claimed that electoral processes in some states were unconstitutional. One of them, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, notably has walked around Congress with a face mask that says ""Trump won."" Trump, still embraced by many Republicans as the party leader, also continues to falsely claim that the election was stolen from him. Trump urged Republicans to push Cheney out of House leadership because she continues to contradict him on the point. McCarthy’s office did not reply to PolitiFact’s request for comment. McCarthy himself and more than 100 House Republicans voted in January against certifying election results from two states that Biden won, Arizona and Pennsylvania. McCarthy at the time justified his objections by saying that millions of Americans were concerned about the integrity of the electoral process and that Congress had a responsibility to listen, investigate and work with states to make changes. ""Constitutional questions have been raised about changes to election processes,"" McCarthy said. He said that his position was ""not about overturning an election"" but about ensuring an ""accurate and accountable process that complies with the Constitution so that millions of Americans who voted on Election Day can have confidence in our system."" Stefanik, a Trump ally, similarly argued that there were electoral issues in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin and Michigan — four states carried by Biden. For example, she claimed that in Michigan, ""signed affidavits document numerous unconstitutional irregularities — officials physically blocking the legal right of poll watchers to observe vote counts, the illegal counting of late ballots, and hand stamping ballots with the previous day’s date."" (PolitiFact debunked many false claims about Michigan’s electoral process, including claims that falsely challenged the legitimacy of ballots counted after midnight on Election Day.) When asked by reporters whether they believe that Biden’s election is legitimate or that the election was stolen, several Republican lawmakers dance around the question. They say Biden is the president, but raise doubts as to how he became president. The Washington Examiner interviewed Stefanik days before her election to the third-ranking Republican post in the House and asked, ""Do you agree with Trump that Biden was illegitimately elected and the election was stolen?"" She did not acknowledge a fair election. She answered: ""President Biden is president, and the focus is on defeating his radical agenda, which I believe we will do in 2024. And we're going to win the midterms in 2022. I have said that there are election irregularities and an unconstitutional overreach, which is why I objected to certain states. You can refer to my statement on the House floor. I fully stand by that, and voters support the focus on those issues. But the irregularity, the unconstitutional overreach, the lack of ballot security, those are important issues that the American people want to hear solutions from the Republicans on."" Stefanik supports an ongoing Republican-commissioned review of election results in Arizona’s Maricopa County — an effort that election experts and some election officials in other states have criticized for being partisan and lacking in transparency. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the second-ranking House Republican, initially dodged the question in February when asked by ABC’s Jonathan Karl about the election’s outcome. ""Joe Biden's the president. There were a few states that did not follow their state laws. That's really the dispute that you've seen continue on,"" Scalise said, before pivoting to talk about manufacturing jobs and ""problems that happened with the election."" Karl then said: ""But congressman, I know Joe Biden's the president. He lives at the White House. I asked you, is he the legitimate president of the United States, and do you concede that this election was not stolen?"" ""Once the electors are counted, yes, he's the legitimate president,"" Scalise said, with a caveat. ""But if you're going to ignore the fact that there were states that did not follow their own state legislatively set laws, that's the issue at heart, that millions of people still are not happy with and don't want to see happen again."" House Republicans voted Cheney out as their conference chair on May 12, the same day as McCarthy’s comments, after she rejected Trump’s false claims of a fraudulent election. Cheney blamed Trump for inciting the violent mob that stormed the Capitol in January as Congress certified the results of the presidential election. And in the face of her impending ouster, Cheney remained defiant. Cheney wrote a May 5 op-ed for the Washington Post — in which she pleaded with Republicans to abandon the falsehood that Trump was cheated out of reelection. ""The 2020 presidential election was not stolen,"" Cheney had tweeted days earlier. ""Anyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE, turning their back on the rule of law, and poisoning our democratic system."" McCarthy said during a May 4 interview on Fox News that he had heard from members concerned about Cheney’s ability ""to carry out the job as conference chair, to carry out the message."" McCarthy said, ""I don't think anybody is questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election."" This runs contrary to the actions and statements of numerous members and leaders of his own party, including himself. McCarthy objected to certifying election results from two states that Biden won, claiming electoral process concerns. Those concerns haven’t been proven. McCarthy and other Republicans also supported a lawsuit that challenged the validity of Biden’s victory in some states. Some Republican lawmakers who have been questioned about Biden’s legitimate victory state the obvious — that Biden is president — while still suggesting that it happened unlawfully. McCarthy’s claim is clearly wrong. We rate it Pants on Fire.

McCrory overstates ramifications of 3rd grade tests
","Former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory is sounding the alarm about how remote learning may affect students long-term. McCrory, who’s running for U.S. Senate, talked about third-grade reading scores on his podcast on May 4. ""The latest statistics coming out of North Carolina is the following,"" McCrory said.  ""75% of third-graders in this year’s class are not reading at a third grade level,"" he said. ""And guess what? If you’re not reading at a third grade level by the time you get out of third grade, there’s probably an 80% chance that you will not graduate."" Is it true that 75% of North Carolina’s third-graders aren’t reading at grade-level? And is it true that there’s an 80% chance those kids won’t graduate high school? McCrory’s first claim has factual basis but needs context. As to the second part about graduation, it appears McCrory mischaracterized a different stat about high school dropouts. Researchers have found a link between third-grade reading and high school success — but McCrory’s statistic is way off. McCrory said ""75% of third-graders in this year’s class are not reading at a third grade level."" This claim isn’t entirely wrong, but it lacks essential context. According to data presented Feb. 9, 75% of third-grade students who’d taken the beginning-of-grade test were not reading at the third-grade reading level. The News & Observer wrote about the data when it was released. McCrory’s listeners could get the impression that 75% of students are on the verge of finishing third-grade without hitting their reading comprehension goal. McCrory’s podcast aired in May, and many districts plan to end their school year in June. Officials with the state Department of Public Instruction (DPI) say it’s important to remember that the test is given to students who haven’t completed the third grade yet. And it’s usually used as a benchmark to see what kind of growth takes place over the course of the school year. Students typically take the beginning-of-grade (or BOG) test in August or September, around the start of the new school year. Due to the unique challenges of the 2020-2021 school year, school districts were allowed to administer these beginning-of-year tests as late as March 12.  The pandemic disrupted the school year and districts returned to in-person learning at different times. So it’s not clear exactly how much later the tests were taken, said Mary Lee Gibson, a DPI spokeswoman. ""The data of when most tests were administered is not readily available since it was an on-going testing period as students return to school,"" Gibson said. Still, she said the test should not be characterized as a ""midyear assessment."" While McCrory cast this year’s test scores as a cause of remote learning, it’s helpful to note that the scores aren’t far off from last year’s beginning-of-year results, DPI spokesman Todd Silberman said. ""There was some shifting across the academic achievement levels, but the total proficient/not proficient was fairly close to the previous year,"" Silberman said. ""The percentage of students scoring at level 1 and level 2 (not proficient) on the BOG in at the start of the 2019-20 school year was 73.6%.""  Students tend to fare better by the end of the year. The 2018-2019 was the most recent school year not affected by the COVID pandemic. That year, the number of non-proficient readers dropped from 72% at the beginning of the year to 43% at the end of the school year. Additionally, DPI officials say it’s also important to remember that reading comprehension is not the sole determiner of whether a student will progress to the next grade level. ""The Beginning of Grade test is used as a benchmark for where students enter third grade after summer to compare with the End of Grade assessment, showing students’ progress over the year,"" Gibson said. Now to the second part of McCrory’s claim. He said that if students aren’t reading at grade-level by the end of the third grade, ""there’s probably an 80% chance that you will not graduate."" Experts say third-grade reading comprehension levels can be a strong indicator of success in high school. However, we couldn’t find the source for McCrory’s ""80%"" claim. Campaign spokesman Jordan Shaw said McCrory was referring to a statistic mentioned in a recent EdNC blog by Mary Ann Wolf, president and executive director of the Public School Forum of North Carolina.  Wolf said ""88% of students who drop out of high school were not reading on grade level in third grade,"" citing a 2010 study by the Annie E. Casey Foundation. That’s not the same thing as what McCrory said. Wolf’s stat is about reading comprehension scores among drop-outs, while McCrory’s stat is about predicting high school success. The Casey Foundation actually addresses the issue at-hand in its 2012 book, ""Double Jeopardy: How Third Grade Reading Skills and Poverty Influence High School Graduation."" The foundation’s webpage for book says ""about 16% of children who are not reading proficiently by the end of third grade do not graduate from high school on time."" The Casey Foundation study research is considered credible and is cited frequently, said Megan Walcek, senior communications manager for GreatSchools.org. It ""has been cited over 1,000 times, which is a good indicator that the academic community finds it reliable,"" she said. The U.S. Department of Education’s Regional Educational Laboratory Program in 2018 cited the Casey Foundation’s book, saying ""One in six children who are not reading proficiently in third grade do not graduate from high school on time."" To be sure we hadn’t overlooked another significant study on the issue, PolitiFact NC reached out to multiple experts — including N.C. State University’s College of Education — about high school graduation odds for students who finish third grade without reading at grade-level. None of them had heard of a drop-out rate at the level McCrory described. ""80% sounds high to me,"" said Dennis Davis, associate professor of literacy education at N.C. State University. ""I would be cautious about any claim that says there’s ‘probably’ an 80% chance you will not graduate,"" said Fran Abrams, chief executive of the Education Media Centre, a research group based in London. McCrory said ""75% of third-graders in this year’s class are not reading at a third grade level,"" adding, ""If you’re not reading at a third grade level by the time you get out of third grade, there’s probably an 80% chance that you will not graduate."" The first part of his claim has factual basis but ignores that the source of his data is the beginning-of-grade test. The second part of McCrory’s claim, meanwhile, is way off. Research has found that 16% of children who are not reading proficiently by the end of third grade do not graduate from high school on time.  The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Did U.S. pause on Johnson & Johnson vaccine help or harm vaccine confidence? Evidence is mixed
","In mid-April, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control recommended a ""pause"" in the administration of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine, saying that blood clots in a tiny fraction of cases required further review. Ten days later, after completing the safety review, both agencies recommended ending the pause and resuming use of the J&J vaccine.  The pause prompted some observers to worry that the federal action could elevate public concern about the safety of the J&J vaccine in particular, and about coronavirus vaccines in general. These concerns were heightened by the near-simultaneous slowdown of immunization rates in most states, as the shrinking pool of unvaccinated Americans became more filled with people who were vaccine hesitant. On May 9, Jeffrey Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, tried to bolster the notion that the vaccines are safe — claiming that the J&J pause only strengthened that view among the public, rather than undermining it. ""The research showed ... that confidence overall in the vaccines increased after the pause,"" Zients said on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" When we looked at polling data, we found some evidence to support Zients’ view but also found survey results that suggest damage has been done to the public’s view of J&J’s vaccine in particular, and perhaps to the others. The picture is more mixed than either solely positive or negative. One piece of evidence that supports Zients’ case comes from a survey sponsored by the de Beaumont Foundation and conducted by pollster Frank Luntz. The survey, which was taken a few days after the pause was announced, found that overall, 40% of respondents said they were more likely to get one of the vaccines than they had been a month before. Meanwhile, weekly polls by YouGov for The Economist have shown slightly declining hesitancy about getting vaccinated since before the pause began. In the poll taken from April 3 to April 6, prior to the pause, 40% of respondents either said they wouldn’t get vaccinated or weren’t sure about getting vaccinated. In the subsequent four polls, that number was 41%, 35%, 33%, and 32%, with the final poll taken between May 1 and May 4. Another poll, sponsored by the media outlet Axios and conducted by the research firm Ipsos, found no evidence of wider vaccine hesitancy after the pause was announced. The Axios poll, which was taken several days after the de Beaumont poll, found that 20% of respondents said they were ""not at all likely"" to get the vaccine as soon as it was available to them. That percentage has shown little change since it was asked in early January 2021. Another data point suggests that Americans felt comfortable with the pause. The Axios poll found that 91% of respondents were aware of the pause, and that of those, 88% said it was a responsible decision. (When we asked the White House for support for Zients’ statement, a spokesperson directed PolitiFact to both the de Beaumont and Axios polls.) Finally, some polling evidence suggests that while J&J’s vaccine was hit by a decline in confidence, the two other vaccines used in the United States, one produced by Pfizer and BioNTech and the other by Moderna, were spared. On the one hand, the Economist/YouGov poll, which surveyed Americans both before and after the pause began, found confidence in the J&J vaccine declining after the pause. Among respondents who answered before the pause was announced, 52% considered it to be ""very safe"" or ""somewhat safe."" That fell to 37% for respondents who answered after the pause was made public. Yet that decline was not mirrored in their view of Pfizer and Moderna. For both those vaccines, nearly 60% of respondents said they believed they were safe — numbers that were essentially unchanged from prior surveys. Another poll, by Dynata for CNBC, showed similar results.  The first choice brand for respondents was Pfizer, at 35%, followed by Moderna and J&J at 17% each. That result marked a significant dropoff for J&J compared with the previous month’s version of the poll, which found that the J&J vaccine — which unlike the other two can be taken in a single shot — had been the favorite of 29%. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, by contrast, both increased their share on this question. The strongest evidence against Zients’ assertion comes from a poll taken by the Kaiser Family Foundation in the second half of April.  Among those who said they were not yet convinced they should get the vaccine right away, 81% reported that they worried about serious side effects from the vaccine — an increase from 70% the prior month. For women, who accounted for the bulk of the reports of blood clots among J&J recipients, concern increased even more. The share with those concerns rose 15 percentage points, from 77% in March to 92% in April. Meanwhile, other surveys mirrored the YouGov poll’s finding that public concern about the safety of J&J’s vaccine was higher than for either Pfizer or Moderna. The Kaiser poll found that 46% believed the J&J vaccine was safe, far below the 69% who said the same for both Pfizer and Moderna. This sentiment was even more pronounced among respondents who told Kaiser they would ""wait and see"" about whether to get a vaccination — essentially, the group of ""vaccine hesitant"" Americans. Among these respondents, more than half said they thought Pfizer and Moderna were safe, compared with just 28% who said they believed J&J was safe. The ABC News-Washington Post poll found similar discrepancies by brand. After the pause, slightly fewer than half of respondents considered the J&J vaccine to be ""very"" or ""somewhat"" safe, compared with better than 7 in 10 respondents for two rival vaccines. And among respondents who were not yet immunized, J&J’s reputation was even worse — fewer than one-third said it was safe. Zients said ""the research showed … that confidence overall in the vaccines increased after the pause"" to review the safety of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine. There is evidence to support his assertion. A de Beaumont Foundation poll found greater enthusiasm to get a vaccination after the pause; YouGov polls show slightly declining hesitancy; and an Axios/Ipsos poll found no softening of interest in getting a vaccination despite the pause. However, there’s also evidence that the pause worried Americans. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey found rising concerns about side effects after the pause was announced. And polls by Kaiser, YouGov and ABC and the Washington Post found low and — after the pause was announced — worsening trust of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, even if that did not spill over into sentiments about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

Ted Cruz repeats false claim that voting bill 'would register millions of illegal aliens to vote'
","Attacks on Senate Democrats’ latest attempt to rewrite the nation’s voting laws have grown fierce, and perhaps no other Republican has condemned the Democratic measure quite like U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.   To Cruz, the For the People Act, or S 1, is ""the most radical legislation the Senate has considered"" since Cruz entered office in 2013, and it’s ""the most dangerous legislation pending before the U.S. Congress,"" he said during a Tuesday morning meeting of the Senate Rules Committee.  Then, invoking a term many Democrats have used to denounce the slew of voter restriction bills being pushed by GOP-led state legislatures across the nation, Cruz called the For the People Act ""Jim Crow 2.0.""  ""This legislation would register millions of illegal aliens to vote. It is intended to do that,"" Cruz said. And by allowing ""millions of people to vote illegally,"" his argument continues, it would ""dilute the legal votes of American citizens.""  ""This bill doesn’t protect voting rights, it steals voting rights from the American people,"" he said.  As it stands now, passage of the For the People Act doesn’t appear likely. The bill’s House version, HR 1, passed nearly along party lines. But it failed to advance in the Senate Rules Committee after a 9-9 deadlock. And if it ever is brought to floor of the split Senate, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin’s break from his party may sink the bill once and for all. (Manchin instead has chosen to support a more narrow voting rights bill, which he says will have a greater chance of gaining some Republican support.)  The Democratic bill is indeed sweeping. At 791 pages, the bill does everything from prohibiting states’ voter ID laws to breaking the gridlock of the Federal Election Commission by removing a member. But would the bill ""register millions of illegal aliens to vote?"" And is registering millions of ineligible voters the bill’s intent?  Cruz was not the first person to say this piece of legislation would expand voting access to immigrants who are in the country illegally. In March, as the House deliberated HR 1, former Vice President Mike Pence wrote in an opinion article that the bill would ensure that ""millions of illegal immigrants are quickly registered to vote."" Similar rhetoric then spread through viral social media posts, which claim that the bill gives immigrants in the country illegally the ""right to vote."" PolitiFact has previously rated both these claims False on the basis that the bill does nothing to alter the legal requirement that only citizens are allowed to register to vote. But Cruz continued that line of argument Tuesday. According to his spokesperson, Cruz argues that the bill’s automatic voter registration provision ""will register ineligible voters, including illegal aliens and noncitizens.""  The automatic voter registration provision would expand a practice that is already in place in 19 states (not including Texas) and Washington, D.C. The policy would require state agencies to share information collected on individuals with election officials to help streamline voter registration processes. A person interacting with one government office — like the department of motor vehicles or a public assistance agency — would have their information forwarded to election officials for registration purposes. This would automatically register eligible citizens to vote or update their voter registration information unless they opt out. The intent of automatic voter registration is to increase voter registration rates and keep voter rolls up to date. During the 2016 election cycle, 33% of all voter registration applications in the U.S. originated at a DMV, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.  The For the People Act states that the purpose of the automatic registration provision is to enable governments ""to register all eligible citizens to vote."" It also states that state agencies can share voter-registration information of eligible citizens only.   But Cruz’s spokesperson, Steve Guest, said that although the bill ""purports only to allow registration for citizens, the bill nowhere requires proof of citizenship as part of automatic registration.""  It’s true that the bill doesn’t add a proof-of-citizenship step to the registration process. But there’s a good reason for that, said David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research. In 2018, a federal judge ruled that a Kansas law requiring people to prove their U.S. citizenship was unconstitutional after the state failed to prove that a substantial number of ineligible people managed to register to vote.  But the absence of that requirement doesn't mean ""millions of illegal aliens"" will begin registering, experts say. If a state agency doesn’t know a person’s citizenship status when referring their information to election officials, it would direct them to a registration form where they would attest to their citizenship, as required by the National Voter Registration Act. Any voter who falsely attests to citizenship on the registration form would face penalties for perjury which, in Texas, is a class A misdemeanor punishable by fines and up to one year in jail.  Local election agencies also still would be required to determine an applicant’s voting eligibility in the same way they already do, which experts say is effective in filtering out noncitizens.  ""We know that the deterrent effect (of perjury penalties) and enforcement of those laws has been highly effective,"" Becker said. ""We do not see any significant number of noncitizens on the lists.""  So how does Cruz figure that the bill would lead to ""millions of illegal aliens"" registering to vote? His office points to ""historical evidence of automatic voter registration registering illegal aliens."" Guest cited a 2018 California case when the DMV notified the secretary of state that voter registrations for 23,000 Californians had been handled incorrectly by the automatic voter registration system. Of that total, 1,500 noncitizens were improperly registered to vote, according to ABC News. Officials traced the error back to a programming flaw, then canceled the erroneous registrations and invalidated mail-in ballots sent to people who were mistakenly registered.  Automatic voter registration glitches have occurred in other states as well. In 2017, Pennsylvania officials said they found 544 ballots potentially cast by noncitizens in elections dating back to 2000 — of about 93 million ballots cast. That’s about 1 out of every 172,000 ballots. Glitches also have occurred in Illinois and Nevada. But these glitches are rare and easily detectable and fixable, Becker said.   ""Those are system glitches, technical problems that absolutely should be fixed. Proving citizenship would not fix them. They were problems in how the systems were designed and they were fixed,"" he said.  When asked how Democrats have demonstrated that the intent of the For the People Act is to ""register millions of illegal aliens to vote,"" Cruz's spokesperson referred to two of the 46 amendments Cruz has introduced. One would require people to prove their citizenship for automatic voter registration. The second would allow for the prosecution of people who are automatically registered but were ineligible. Cruz’s office argues that Democrats’ lack of support for these amendments proves that their intent behind the bill is to allow noncitizens to vote. ""If Democrats don’t actually intend to register illegal aliens and the bill wouldn’t actually register illegal aliens and noncitizens, then they would have supported Sen. Cruz’s amendments,"" Guest said. ""There are millions of illegal immigrants in America. The intended effect of automatic voter registration is to register millions of illegal aliens to vote and Democrats blocked explicit provisions to verify citizenship and remove legal protections for the inevitably registered illegal aliens.""  According to Becker, the lack of support for Cruz’s proof-of-citizenship amendment is due to the unconstitutionality ruling from Kansas.   ""It would not be unusual for anyone who understands the law to suggest that they not include something in the bill that could violate the U.S. Constitution,"" he said.  And the lack of support for Cruz’s amendment that would allow prosecution is due to the fact that automatic voter registration systems do occasionally err — as evidenced by cases in California, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Nevada. And it’s unreasonable to prosecute people whose voter registrations were caught up in system glitches through no fault of their own, Becker said.   During a Senate committee meeting over a Democratic voting rights bill, Cruz said that the bill will ""register millions of illegal aliens to vote."" He also said that this is the Democrats’ intent behind this bill because Democrats believe these people ""are likely to vote for Democrats.""  His claim is based on a requirement in the bill that directs states to adopt automatic voter registration systems, which 19 states and Washington D.C. already have. But a section of the law instructs state agencies to share information for voter registration purposes only for citizens. People are also required to attest to their citizenship under penalties of perjury. The bill also does not change the fact that local election agencies would still be required to vet an applicant’s voting eligibility, as they have done in the past.   Although glitches and malfunctions of automatic registration systems have been recorded, they are rare and easily corrected. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC713340>],/factchecks/2021/may/14/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-repeats-false-claim-voting-bill-would-reg/

Wisconsin Congressman Gallagher flips position on supporting Liz Cheney
","On May 12, 2021, U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyoming, was ousted from her position as chair of the House Republican Conference -- the No. 3 job in the caucus -- in a closed-door meeting.  The move followed months of consternation among House Republicans, after Cheney repeatedly rebuked former President Donald Trump for his false claims of 2020 election fraud and his role in inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. Most of Wisconsin’s Republican members of Congress have been consistent in their views on Cheney, including whether she should or shouldn’t be in the role. Not U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, who represents the Green Bay area. That makes this a perfect candidate for our Flip-O-Meter, which always comes with this requisite reminder: We’re evaluating whether a politician has been consistent in his or her position, not whether any change in position makes for smart politics. Has Gallagher been consistent on the question of whether Cheney should hold a leadership role? No. Far from it. In February, Gallagher not only backed Cheney but was very public in his support for her on what was a secret ballot. Cheney easily survived that challenge, which was prompted by her vote to impeach Trump for his role in the storming of the Capitol.  Unlike Cheney, Gallagher voted against impeaching Trump. But like Cheney, he condemned Trump’s role in the events of Jan. 6, and said Trump lied about fraud in the election.  ""First, let’s be candid. President Donald Trump bears responsibility for the tragic events of Jan. 6, "" Gallagher wrote in a Jan. 13, 2021 Madison.com opinion piece. ""He lied to his supporters, insisted that his ‘sacred landslide’ election was stolen, and suggested that Vice President Mike Pence should or even could reverse the outcome. He then dithered for hours as the vice president, the Congress and its employees were in mortal danger, castigating Pence as a coward."" In a statement prior to the vote, Gallagher praised Cheney as a ""principled conservative and our most passionate advocate for American primacy"" and added:  ""She is also unafraid to clearly state and defend her views even if they are unpopular. As we figure out where Republicans go from here, we need Liz’s leadership. We must be a big tent party or else condemn ourselves to irrelevance."" On May 11, 2021, the day before the vote on Cheney, four of Wisconsin’s five Republican U.S. House members indicated that they would vote to oust her from her position.  That included Gallagher, who had this to say in a statement: ""House Democrats under Speaker Pelosi have been ruthless in advancing their radical progressive agenda, and Rep. Cheney can no longer unify the House Republican conference in opposition to that agenda. We need to take back the House in 2022 and permanently retire Pelosi."" Following the vote, Cheney said: ""We cannot let the former president drag us backward and make us complicit in his efforts to unravel our democracy. Down that path lies our destruction, and potentially the destruction of our country."" Cheney also said that if Trump tries to run again, ""I will do everything I can to ensure that the former president never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office."" Trump, in a statement, called Cheney ""a bitter, horrible human being."" But that battle -- Trump vs. Cheney -- has been consistent. What hasn’t been consistent is Gallagher’s position on Cheney in caucus leadership. In February, Gallagher praised Cheney as a ""principled conservative and our most passionate advocate for American primacy"" and said ""we must be a big tent party or else condemn ourselves to irrelevance."" Three months later, he declared Cheney should no longer hold her position. That’s a complete change in position, or as we call it, a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC42F00>],/factchecks/2021/may/14/mike-gallagher/wisconsin-congressman-gallagher-flips-position-sup/

San Francisco 49ers QB Trey Lance Signed A $34M Contract. How Much Will Go To California Taxes?
","Days after rookie quarterback Trey Lance signed to the San Francisco 49ers after being taken third overall in the National Football League draft, an image posted on Instagram kicked off debate over how much of his $34.1 million deal might go to California income taxes. The image, posted on May 3, shows a photo of California Gov. Gavin Newsom laughing, which is superimposed over a photo of Lance on draft day. Text in the image states, ""After California taxes, Trey Lance's $34.1M rookie deal becomes just $16M.""  It was originally posted by Sports for Simps, an account with around 17,000 followers that shares content related to football. Later, it was reshared by Catchcentral Sports HQ, a page with more than 70,000 followers.  The original post included a caption that read: ""Californians: OUR CONTRACT,"" a reference to a series of memes satirizing socialism. It gained more than 17,200 likes and 1,600 comments, many of which criticized California’s income tax rates.  But are the numbers in the image accurate, or is this a false start? Facebook flagged this image as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed, so we decided to find out. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.) Running the numbers Lance’s contract with the 49ers stipulates that he will receive a $22.1 million signing bonus in addition to his annual salary from the team. His entire contract is valued at $34.1 million and is valid for four years, with the option of a fifth-year extension. Assuming Lance lives in California, files as a single individual and claims an income of $34.1 million, he would pay roughly $18.1 million in federal and state income taxes given current tax rates. Of that $18.1 million, roughly $830,000 would be taken out in payroll taxes, about $12.6 million would be claimed by the federal government, and California would be owed $4.5 million. After paying that $18.1 million in income taxes, Lance would be left with approximately $16 million — although he would also possibly have to pay property taxes if he owns real estate and sales taxes on items he buys. But because the deal runs for four years, Lance won’t receive the entire sum of his contract upfront. His salary will be paid on a set schedule over that time. Traditionally, the NFL has also paid large signing bonuses in several installments. However, this is a part of the contract that is negotiable, and Lance’s agents will likely maneuver to have his signing bonus paid as a lump sum, since 2019 second overall pick Nick Bosa got his bonus as a one-time payment from the 49ers. According to tax experts, there are tax implications surrounding whether or not Lance gets his money all at once or in a series of installments over the course of several years. Income taxes are progressive, meaning that the tax rate progresses from low to high over the amount an individual earns. For someone filing as a single individual in California, all income over $599,012 is taxed at 12.3%. There’s also a 1% mental health services tax on income over $1 million. But income under those bars is taxed at lower rates.  For Lance, this means that his first $599,012 in income will be taxed at a lesser rate than any income over that which he claims for any given year and he won’t have to pay the mental health services tax on his first million dollars each year. By spreading out his income, he can make the most of those lower tax rates, said Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics and law at UC Berkeley and the director of the Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance. The same concept applies to federal income taxes. So, by spreading out his income, Lance could also score savings there. Federally, the top rate is currently 37% on income over $518,400. Other factors that could fumble tax estimates There’s a number of other complications that make it difficult to determine how much Lance might pay in taxes over the next four years. He could see his taxes go up if his income increases because he signs endorsement deals or establishes other streams of income. They could go down if he opts to donate money and takes advantage of tax breaks available for charitable giving. His taxes could also be impacted by future uncertainties. For instance, Lance could get married, which would change his filing status, or have a child, which would add a dependent to his taxes.  Outside of Lance’s personal life, there is currently a pending bill in the California Senate that would increase the state’s top tax rate to 16.8%. The law would also apply retroactively to January 1, 2020. David Kline, vice president of communications and research for the California Taxpayers Association, said the bill isn’t expected to pass this year. Still, there have been other proposed bills that could impact high-earners’ tax burdens, and Kline said it is ""impossible to predict"" what may or may not be approved by the legislature over the course of four years, and difficult to calculate a tax bill with no knowledge of how Lance’s money and life might change. ""We always caution that there are a lot of variables that impact income taxes,"" Kline said. ""It is important to let people know that it is impossible to determine the exact amount without knowing the taxpayer's filing status, number of dependents, total income from other sources, possible losses, whether a mortgage interest deduction applies, amount of charitable deductions and other details."" What do other rookies’ taxes look like? Many of the comments on the image posted on Instagram drew comparisons between Lance’s taxes and those of others in the 2021 first-round draft, particularly Trevor Lawrence, the first overall pick in this year’s draft who signed to the Jacksonville Jaguars with a $36.7 million deal. The comments noted that California has the highest state income tax rate in the nation. Meanwhile, Florida does not have an income tax, so Lawrence would primarily be concerned with his federal taxes, which are estimated to be around $13.6 million. Ultimately, Auerbach and Kline said Lance will almost certainly end up paying more in taxes than Lawrence and most others in the first-round draft.  ""Athletes who play for California teams are going to pay higher taxes than they would if they played in any of the other 49 states,"" Kline said. Still, that doesn’t mean that Lawrence and other players in low-cost states get away scot-free. One complication surrounding NFL players’ taxes is that they also have to pay income taxes whenever they travel for games and practices — a levy colloquially known as the ""jock tax.""  It means every time Lance travels outside of California for a game, he’s racking up bills in other states based on his annual salary and working days in that location, and every time a player from outside of California comes into the state for a game or practice, tax law stipulates that they need to pay for the ""service days"" they spend in California. Because California has the highest top income tax rate in the country, Auerbach said most of the state and local taxes Lance needs to pay while traveling should be deductible against his California tax bill, meaning that they’ll likely have no impact on the overall amount he pays in taxes. They would, however, potentially impact his competitors outside of California. In the past, Kline said California has also taxed athletes endorsement income if they fulfill elements of their contracts while in the state. ""When a Florida resident like Tiger Woods played in a gold tournament in California wearing a Nike hat, California sought to tax a portion of the Nike endorsement contract on the grounds that some of the income was attributable to wearing the hat while in California,"" Kline said. California’s Franchise Tax Board, which collects and audits income taxes, writes in their Residency and Sourcing Technical Manual that endorsement cash can be taxed if an athlete is ""wearing or using [a] sponsor's product,"" ""making promotional appearances"" or ""participating in photo and filming days"" on and off the field in California. That means that Lawrence and other players outside the state could pay a pretty penny for promoting Nike or Adidas on Lance’s home turf. Our ruling An image posted on Instagram claimed that rookie quarterback Trey Lance, who recently signed to the San Francisco 49ers, will take home $16 million from his $34.1 million deal after paying California income taxes. Given current tax rates, this seems to be a reasonable estimate of how much Lance might take home after paying federal and state income taxes on his contract with the NFL. He will pay significantly more in federal income taxes than in state income taxes — about $12.6 million compared to an estimated $4.5 million. Additionally, tax experts caution that it is impossible to determine exactly how much Lance will pay in taxes because his tax burden will be impacted by when he earns his income, his filing status and his charitable contributions, among other personal factors. Lance could also establish endorsement deals that increase his income, which would affect his taxes. Since his contract with the 49ers runs for four years, he could be impacted by changes to state and federal tax rates and laws surrounding tax breaks and deductions. And while Lance will almost certainly pay more in state income taxes than some of his competitors in low-cost states, they’ll be hit with the same high tax rates every time they travel to face off against the 49ers in Santa Clara. In short, while the estimate is reasonable, it’s also exactly that — a rough estimate that’s missing a little context. Therefore, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB4DC80>],/factchecks/2021/may/13/instagram-posts/san-francisco-49ers-qb-trey-lance-signed-34m-contr/

The ridiculous claim that those at the Capitol Jan. 6 resembled a 'normal tourist visit'
","Some Republicans downplayed the violent acts that occurred at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, with one lawmaker comparing the breach to a ""normal tourist visit."" Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., said there was no insurrection and that the House floor was not breached. Clyde said there was an ""undisciplined mob"" and ""some rioters and some who committed acts of vandalism, but let me be clear: There was no insurrection."" ""Watching the TV footage of those who entered the Capitol and walked through Statuary Hall, showed people in an orderly fashion staying between the stanchions and ropes taking videos and pictures. If you didn't know the TV footage was a video from Jan. 6, you would actually think it was a normal tourist visit,"" Clyde said at a May 12 House hearing.   Clyde’s comparison of the breach of the Capitol to a ""normal tourist visit"" is a ridiculous assertion.  The Capitol Visitor Center remains closed due to the pandemic, but here is what a normal visit looks like for tourists: They go on guide-led tours of historic areas. They buy souvenirs at the gift shop. They view temporary exhibits. They dine in the restaurant. And they do it all without bringing in weapons (or even water). Here’s what rioters did on Jan. 6. They forced their way through barricades and past law enforcement to breach the building. They smashed windows and broke doors. They ransacked offices. They chanted ""Hang Mike Pence!"" They attacked police officers. They caused the House and Senate to shut down for several hours on the day they were certifying the presidential election. One put his feet up on a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office and left her a nasty note. None of these actions are things that tourists normally do at the Capitol. Clyde’s spokesperson emailed us a video from NBC of people who were walking through Statuary Hall snapping photos or videos at about 2:30 p.m. Jan. 6, shortly after the Capitol was breached. The journalists speaking in the report note that these people had breached the Capitol and hadn’t gone through security.  The fact that people weren't seen committing violence on camera during that particular moment doesn’t make it a tourist visit. A description in one of the charging documents states that at about 2 p.m., people forced their way through, up and over barricades and police officers to advance to the exterior facade of the building. They forced their way into the building by breaking windows and assaulting law enforcement. The Justice Department has charged more than 400 people in connection with the riot, according to a database by the George Washington University Center on Extremism. Charges include obstruction of law enforcement; violence with a deadly weapon; assault; disorderly conduct; and unlawful possession of firearms.  Court documents outlining conspiracy charges show members of the Proud Boys, a far right group, posted messages on social media discussing plans to show up on Jan. 6 ""incognito.""  Some members of the group were seen wearing earpieces and walkie-talkie style communication devices. Some people at the riot were associated with other extremist or white supremacist groups. Some of the rioters grabbed a police officer, dragged him and struck him in the head and body with various objects, according to charging documents. Another rioter used a metal flagpole to attack a police officer. Reports of the number of weapons confiscated are likely an undercount of the weapons people brought to the Capitol. But video shows the mob used makeshift weapons including hockey sticks, flagpoles and a police shield stolen from an officer. The Justice Department’s database of charges shows several defendants charged with offenses related to deadly or dangerous weapons, and a few were charged with offenses related to firearm possession. ""Normal Capitol visits don’t include individuals armed with zip ties, bear spray, and blunt objects,"" or violent clashes with police, said Michael Jensen, principal investigator at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. ""Typical Capitol tourists don’t smash windows, loot offices, or deface Capitol property. Those types of things happen during insurrections, which is what Jan. 6 was."" Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, said the criminals who rioted were at the Capitol for purposes far from tourism. ""A tourist is someone who travels for pleasure seeking, cultural interchange or advancement of knowledge about different places and its inhabitants and does not have a political or criminal purpose,"" Levin said. ""The people who rioted included insurrectionists and others who committed federal crimes for a political purpose to obstruct the legal operations of government. I hope people now don't just apply that logic to recast John Wilkes Booth as a theatergoer.""   Clyde said, ""Watching the TV footage of those who entered the Capitol … . If you didn't know the TV footage was from Jan. 6, you would actually think it was a normal tourist visit."" Clyde’s spokesperson pointed to a few moments of video of people walking through Statuary Hall snapping photos or videos. But those people were not engaged in anything that resembles tourism. They were part of a group who had violently breached the U.S. Capitol. Rioters that day assaulted police officers and vandalized the building, resulting in more than 400 people charged with crimes. This was no tourist visit, and there was nothing normal about it. This is a ridiculous statement. Pants on Fire!

Why some gas stations are advertising $9.99 unleaded
","Images of gas station signs with prices for regular unleaded gasoline listed at $9.89 and $9.99 per gallon are spreading on social media.  Posts have variously described the pictures as being taken in Spartanburg, S.C., and the North Carolina towns of Cornelius, Johnsonville, and Jacksonville.  They were all flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We don’t have any reason to believe the photos aren’t authentic, but there’s some context people who see them should know. It appears that those stations aren’t actually selling gas for nearly $10.  One of the photos shows a Circle K sign that a post says was taken in Jacksonville. We called all the Circle Ks in the city where we could find contact information. Several station employees answered the phone by saying they were out of gas. One told us that stations with signs listing gas prices at nearly $10 were out of gas — and not selling it for that much. An employee at another station, which did have gas, was selling it for $2.74 per gallon.  According to GasBuddy, regular unleaded gas prices in Jacksonville, N.C., were all under $3 on May 13. That was generally true elsewhere in North Carolina, too. WFMY, a CBS News affiliate in Greensboro, N.C., reported on May 12 that the photo of the gas station in Cornelius was not selling gas for $9.99 but signaling to drivers that it had no gas.  ""That kind of sign pricing is an industry-standard,"" reporter Tanya Rivera wrote in her report. ""The thinking is, no one would believe gas is really $9.99 and customers would know something is wrong and gas can’t be pumped.""  This kind of confusion has happened before.  In 2017, a Louisiana radio station reported that the ""999"" people were seeing on gas station signs  meant the stations were ""out of fuel, or unable to sell fuel."" That year, a gas pipeline was damaged in Alabama, causing shortages along the east coast, the station said.  And in 2016, an ABC News affiliate in Durham, N.C., reported that photos then circulating of gas stations advertising $9.99 unleaded also showed stations indicating they had run out of fuel. Tiffany Wright, a spokesperson for AAA in North Carolina, told us that she suspected any such signs surfacing today signal the same: ""We are in a state of emergency and price gouging isn’t tolerated.""

","Social media posts about the recent cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline are swinging between fears of gasoline shortages and derision from some people scornful of folks hurrying to the gas station to stock up.  ""Plastic bags filled with gas by morons in South Carolina,"" reads the description of one image that’s being spread on social media. It’s a photo of a car trunk filled with several plastic bags holding liquid. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recently advised Americans to ""not fill plastic bags with gasoline,"" but this photo is not an example of it happening stateside in the wake of the Colonial Pipeline disruption.  The photo has been online for more than two years.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A reverse image search leads to a couple of Mexican publications. In March 2019, Televisa.news reported that police had detained the drivers of two vehicles that were transporting more than 1,000 liters of gasoline in plastic bags in Huauchinango, Mexico. A caption of the photo — translated by Google from Spanish to English — says it shows ""a thousand liters of fuel in plastic bags."" The next day, Aristegui Noticias published the photo with a story about two people who had been arrested after they tried to carry ""more than a thousand liters of illegal gasoline in the trunk of their cars.""  The photo wasn’t taken in South Carolina, so we rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC61FC00>],/factchecks/2021/may/13/viral-image/no-isnt-photo-south-carolinians-who-filled-plastic/

Low unemployment in Iowa after the pandemic
","Democrats were quick to criticize Iowa’s Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds when Reynolds announced on Tuesday, May 11, that the state will stop taking federal funds for supplemental $300 payments to Iowans receiving unemployment benefits. The shift away from that COVID-19-related federal aid program, which means an end to the payment to out-of-work Iowans, is to take effect after June 12, 2021. The announcement came one day after an Iowa Workforce Development memorandum that said Iowa has a workforce shortage, which led Rep. Lindsey James (D-Dubuque) to state on Twitter: ""There are more job openings than there are people on unemployment. Let’s name the real problem here – Iowa needs higher wages. #ialegis"" More available jobs than people on unemployment to fill them? Yes, that is what the Iowa Workforce Development report, from director Beth Townsend to Reynolds, states. Iowa had 60,900 unemployed workers in March for a 3.7 percent unemployment rate, that report stated, relying on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.  More than 66,000 job openings showed up on the IowaWORKS website on May 10, Townsend wrote in the memorandum.  ""Claims, continued and initial, continue to trend down,"" Townsend’s memorandum stated. ""Terminating the federal unemployment programs will not affect individuals eligible for regular state unemployment insurance claim benefits."" Republicans, backed by business owners and trade groups, have argued that employers are having difficulty attracting workers in Iowa because of the jobless benefits money those prospective workers are receiving. ""The overwhelming message we receive from employers these days is the lack of workforce that is adversely affecting their ability to recover from the pandemic,"" Townsend said in a statement released by the governor’s office.  Democrats, like James, counter that employers need to offer higher wages. ""Iowa had a labor shortage pre-COVID and it has continued now that we are recovering from COVID,"" James wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa. Moreover, she wrote, Iowa has more job openings that aren’t on the IowaWORKS website. Registered nursing jobs are most in demand in Iowa, the IowaWORKS website shows, but those jobs require special training and are an example of job requirements and pay disparity that exists. Other jobs, such as wait staff that Iowa restaurant owners told The Gazette newspaper in Eastern Iowa they need, don’t require the specialized college education a registered nursing job needs. Wait staff starting pay is around $8.45 an hour, far less than the $23.84 an hour entry pay for registered nurses in Iowa, state wage data show. After hearing about pandemic-related layoffs and job cuts the past year, seeing that more people are seeking jobs in Iowa than are taking unemployment benefits might surprise some. But the numbers back it up and both sides of the argument on what Iowa should do about unemployment benefits do not dispute it. We are confining our rating to the numbers and rate the claim to be True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC735E00>],/factchecks/2021/may/12/lindsay-james/low-unemployment-iowa-after-pandemic/
