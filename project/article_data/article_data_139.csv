McAuliffe ad says Cuccinelli ""wants to make all abortion illegal""
","Democrat Terry McAuliffe keeps returning to abortion in his effort to paint Republican Ken Cuccinelli as a conservative extremist. A new ad by McAuliffe features Holly Puritz, a Norfolk obstetrician and gynecologist, saying she’s ""offended"" by Cuccinelli. ""Cuccinelli wants to make all abortion illegal, even in cases of rape and incest, even to protect a woman’s health,"" she says. We asked McAuliffe’s campaign for proof of its blanket claim. Spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed to Cuccinelli’s support of personhood bills in 2007 and 2012 that would have granted legal rights to human embryos from the moment of conception. Those bills, he said, would have banned all abortions. Cuccinelli, as we’ve noted before, did support personhood bills. But that doesn’t mean he opposes abortion in every circumstance. Since his first campaign for the state Senate in 2002, he has backed a narrow exception for abortions in cases where a mother’s life would be endangered by remaining pregnant. Cuccinelli’s position was well known to McAuliffe’s campaign. In a Sept. 17 news release announcing the ad and justifying its claims, McAuliffe’s camp noted that during a 2009 debate, ""Cuccinelli said he would support abortion only when the woman’s life was at risk."" While researching another abortion-related claim this summer, we asked Cuccinelli’s camp if the candidate still carved out that lone exception. His advisers declined to answer. The Cuccinelli campaign did, however, confirm for FactCheck.org and The Washington Post, earlier this month that the candidate still holds that abortions should be allowed only to save a mother’s life. Both organizations published articles containing the information about a week before McAuliffe’s commercial debuted. Statistics are not available for the number of abortions that are performed to save the life of a mother. Neither the Guttmacher Institute nor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collect such data. Guttmacher, in a 2004, conducted a survey of 1,209 abortion patients. Four percent of the women cited personal health problems as the chief reason they were having an abortion. Our ruling McAuliffe’s ad says, ""Cuccinelli wants to make all abortion illegal, even in cases of rape and incest, even to protect a woman’s health."" Cuccinelli is an adamant opponent of abortion, but he has consistently supported one rare exception: Allowing abortion when a mother’s life is endangered by pregnancy. His position was known to McAuliffe’s campaign and incongruously cited in its news release announcing the ad. It’s not easy to overstate Cuccinelli’s objections to abortion, but McAuliffe’s ad manages to do just that. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/sep/19/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-ad-says-cuccinelli-opposes-all-abortions/

Nan Rich says Florida is 48th in K-12 funding and 50th in higher education
","As he faces re-election next year, Republican Gov. Rick Scott says he wants to put money back in taxpayers’ pockets. He touts a property tax cut he got in 2011 (in reality, a smidgen), a pay hike for teachers in 2013 and now his proposal to cut $500 million in taxes or fees. Scott hasn’t released specifics on his next tax cuts, but his overall message is clear: He wants voters to see him as the guy in their corner saving them money. Former Democratic state Sen. Nan Rich who is running against Scott, calls his idea a re-election gimmick in light of Florida’s pressing needs -- including education. ""We need to be taking a long hard look at funding the critical needs of the state,"" she said Sept. 11. ""We’re 48th in K-12 funding and 50th in higher education."" Rich said more funding for education would be a better way to help the middle class. Florida has often gotten a bad rap for education spending -- but just how bottom of the barrel are we? PolitiFact Florida examined the state’s K-12 education funding ranking in 2010, but we wanted to see if the numbers had changed and if Rich had done her homework. K-12 funding There are lots of different ways to compare funding for K-12 or higher education. How Florida ranks depends on many factors such as whether the cost-of-living in various states is taken into account. Some analyses focus on state money while others also factor in local dollars. Not surprisingly, depending on the methodology, we found different numbers for Florida’s ranking. But most were in the bottom of the pack. Rich directed us to the U.S. Census Bureau which shows Florida ranked 42nd in per-pupil funding at $10,031, taking into account federal, state and local sources, or 48th for state funding alone at $3,440 in 2011. Rich had cited that 48th figure. We found many other entities that provide state comparisons on education funding in a variety of ways including the National Education Association, Education Week and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) which is part of the U.S. Department of Education. NCES, for example, shows that Florida spent $9,030 per pupil in 2011, ahead of 13 other states. (This chart combines funding so it’s not a measurement of only state spending.) Why the different ranking between the NCES report and the census report that Rich referenced? NCES includes charter schools, while the census generally doesn’t, said Mark Dixon, project manager for the annual survey of school system finances for the census. Higher education funding Rich didn’t direct us to a source of data for her claim about Florida ranking 50th in higher education. But much like K-12 funding comparisons, we found that different methodologies produced different rankings for Florida. The NEA ranked Florida 50th on per capita state and local government expenditures for higher education for the 2009-10 school year. The amount spent per capita was $485 -- just one buck lower than Nevada and ahead of the District of Columbia. We found more recent data through Grapevine, a longstanding annual report by Illinois State University. About half the states fund higher education in part through local funds, but the Grapevine report only shows state money. That report doesn’t provide rankings but compares the states per capita, which refers to the state’s overall population. That analysis shows Florida at $172.98 per capita. By our count, that placed Florida ahead of eight states in 2013. ""I try to avoid rankings,"" said Jim Palmer, a professor and editor of Grapevine. ""You’ve got 50 different state systems ... you have to wonder what the rankings really mean. If one state ranks lower than another does that mean the higher education system is not as good? I can’t make that judgment."" We were surprised to find Florida gave more money per capita than Massachusetts and asked Palmer to elaborate. ""The history of education in Massachusetts is not as reliant on the public sector as it has been in Florida. The private sector looms large in Massachusetts going back to Harvard. ... Florida devoted itself to developing a strong community college system -- stronger than New England."" Palmer directed us to the State Higher Education Executive Officers, a group that publishes a report using Grapevine's state data along with other sources of funds, including local dollars and stimulus money. It also takes into account factors such as cost-of-living. That report showed Florida at $5,130 -- ahead of about 20 states. Our ruling Rich said, ""We’re 48th in K-12 funding and 50th in higher education."" There are lots of different valid ways to measure education funding. One way is to compare how much money a state provides for education per pupil, and by that measure Florida ranked 48th according to the Census. That’s a valid way to look at the numbers because it was in the context of Rich criticizing the governor who signs the state budget. However, it’s one of several ways to measure school spending. For higher education spending, the National Education Association ranked Florida 50th for state and local expenditures in 2009-10. But other more recent analysis we reviewed showed Florida higher than 50th. One measure showed Florida ahead of about 20 states. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/19/nan-rich/nan-rich-rankings-education-funding-florida/
"['Criminal Justice', 'Wisconsin', 'Chris Larson']","
Chris Larson says Capitol Police are using paramilitary equipment against protesters
","Arrests and escalating tension became routine at the longrunning Solidarity Sing Along protests at the Capitol rotunda in Madison after a judge left in place for now the state's authority to require a permit to protest when more than 20 demonstrators gather. Many refused to get permits after the July ruling, and Capitol Police responded with arrests after trying futilely to shout warnings into bullhorns as a chorus of protesters drowned them out. The noontime protests began in 2011 in reaction to Gov. Scott Walker’s move to sharply curtail union collective bargaining power. In early September 2013, trying to break the standoff over the singalong arrests, a top legislative Democrat took both the singers and the Walker administration to task. ""I think the singers are in the wrong and should get a permit if they are going to protest on a continuous basis and they know they are going to be there,"" Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson of Milwaukee said Sept. 5, 2013 on ""The Devil’s Advocates Radio show (WXXM-FM 92.1 in Madison). ""I agree with many of their protests, I agree with where they’re coming from, but I think it’s a simple act ..."" Then Larson caught our attention with this: ""At the same time, I think that Walker is overstepping his bounds and is in the wrong by enforcing this to the extent that he is, in giving his police chief a raise in a shadowy way, and is going so far as to use paramilitary equipment to try and shut down the voices of the protesters. So both sides could take a step towards the middle."" We’re familiar with the controversy over the use of a ghost job to give the new Capitol Police chief a double-digit pay raise. But Larson’s line about ""paramilitary equipment"" employed by the Capitol cops was a new one for us. The phrase conjures up images of officers in riot gear and flak jackets, and advanced weaponry inside the Capitol, where -- we should note -- arrests have tapered off dramatically in September. Larson’s office told us the ""equipment"" in question is one device that broadcasts a message warning protesters they are subject to arrest unless they disperse. The machine can emit a high-pitched noise, we were told. With a bit of research, we found that protesters here and elsewhere call the machine a ""sound cannon"" or ""sonic weapon."" And with a bit more research, we learned that state officials term it an ""advanced microphone."" Sounds like a job for the Truth-O-Meter. The equipment in question is described by its manufacturer as the hand-held LRAD 100X ""long range acoustic device."" It and its much larger cousins have come under scrutiny as crowd-control and communication mechanisms in clashes between police and protesters in Occupy Wall Street demonstrations, at the NATO summit in Chicago and elsewhere. The device’s loudspeaker function cut through crowd noise and clearly communicate at up to 1,000 meters, its maker, San Diego-based LRAD Corporation, says. Protesters who’ve labeled it a cannon have focused on the high-pitched, high-decibel ""warning tone"" the machine can emit. The continuous squeal sent street protesters scurrying away at the G-20 summit in Pittsburgh in 2009. Regarding the warning tone on the LRAD 100X model used at the Capitol, the company’s website says: ""The warning tone provides a non-lethal deterrent, shapes behavior, and supports intent determination while preserving time for force escalation."" Translation: the tone can get people’s attention, get them to momentarily stop what they are doing or move out of the way. At very close range (about 3 feet), the 100X’s warning tone puts out 137 decibels continuously. Brief exposure to noise at 120 dB (a nearby clap of thunder) or 140-190 dB (gunshot) can cause immediate hearing damage, according to the Dangerous Decibels project. LRAD spokesman Robert Putnam told us that putting hands over your ears or stepping six feet out of the narrow sound field can remove the risk of injury. But here’s the deal: With the exception of a brief test, it appears that Capitol Police in Madison are not using the warning tone. We watched dozens of YouTube videos taken by protesters, and talked to people who’ve observed most of the rallies, and could find evidence of only one rally at which police briefly sounded the continuous shrill warning tone. That was on July 18, 2013, which our research shows may have been the first day the police put the device into use. A spokeswoman for the state agency that oversees the Capitol Police, told us the device is not being used ""in that manner"" but declined to discuss the July 18 video. ""It would be inaccurate to say that the (Capitol Police Department) uses the LRAD in a harmful manner – they use it make an announcement,"" state Department of Administration spokeswoman Stephanie Marquis said. ""There is a brief beeping right before the announcement starts ..."" On July 18, the video shows, uniformed officers accompanied by a man in street clothes walked the device in with the warning squeal activated. ""Watch out, there’s a sleeping child,"" an off-camera man says to them. The warning tone sounded for at least 20 seconds and crowd reaction to it appeared minimal. In Madison, a story in Isthmus, the Madison weekly newspaper and website, on the July 18 protest called the device a ""loudspeaker."" On that day and others we observed on video, officers stationed themselves one floor above the ground floor of the rotunda where most singers gather. One officer holds up the 14-inch by 14-inch black speaker while another works the microphone and MP3 player containing the message to disperse. It did not appear that arrests were made on July 18. Overall, then, the evidence strongly suggests that police are using the machine to get a message out before making arrests, not to drive people off with an annoying or threatening warning tone. Paramilitary in nature? Larson described the device as ""paramilitary"" in nature. In recent years, as critics have complained about the militarization of police forces, the ""paramilitary"" label has been attached to a variety of gear, notably that used by military-style special weapons and tactics (SWAT) units. Things like body armor, shields, night vision goggles, armored vehicles. The marketing of the acoustic devices suggests it fits into multiple categories, including military, paramilitary, and traditional law enforcement. LRAD Corporation created it following the 2000 terrorist attack on the USS Cole. Since then, the military, companies -- and more than 100 law enforcement agencies including National Guard units -- have put them to use in diverse ways including fending off pirates, issuing storm warnings, serving warrants and for SWAT operations, riot control, hostage situations and crowd control at large events and protests. In war zones, soldiers have mounted units to vehicles or used them at security checkpoints to communicate with civilians in order to avoid potentially lethal misunderstandings, said Putnam. So there’s no doubt they have military and paramilitary applications, and are marketed as such. Still, they can also be used purely as communications devices, as the Capitol Police in Madison appear to be doing. The devices, we found, do not appear on a list of ""paramilitary"" equipment outlined in United Nations sanctions documents banning batons, clubs, riot sticks, body armor, riot shields and whips. A detailed 2011 Canadian police review of law enforcement use of LRADs said they have been called both ""weapons"" and ""devices."" The review recommended that police factor in volume control and standoff distances when using the warning alarm function. Our rating Larson said the Capitol Police force under Walker is ""going so far as to use paramilitary equipment"" at daily singalong protests in Madison. There’s an element of truth to his claim, in that these devices have paramilitary and military uses. But they also are used by a variety of non-military agencies for communication and mass notification, and Capitol Police appear to have used them predominantly, if not almost exclusively, to make sure protesters are clued in that arrests will follow if they don’t disperse. Unlike in Pittsburgh and other cities where police have used the devices, we found no scenes here of stunned protesters scurrying away in the face of ear-splitting noise. Our definition of Mostly False is that a statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We think that fits here. Editors note: This item was updated Sept. 19, 2013 to clarify in the first paragraph the judge's ruling.",/factchecks/2013/sep/19/chris-larson/chris-larson-says-capitol-police-are-using-paramil/

Van Hollen says employer mandate affects 5% of businesses
","On Obamacare, Republicans generally fall into two camps. One group wants to defund it entirely and the other wants to delay putting it into action. President Barack Obama gave the delay group some ammunition in July when he made the surprise decision to hold off enforcing the employer mandate. That provision in the Affordable Care Act requires most firms with 50 or more workers to offer insurance or face a penalty of $2,000 per employee. There are some wrinkles, but that’s the gist of the mandate. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., defended the president’s move, arguing that it had little impact on the overall goal of the health care reform law. He made this point during a quick back and forth with the show host on Fox News Sunday. Van Hollen: The reality is that Obamacare is already in place for millions of Americans. John Roberts: But it's been delayed for millions of others. Van Hollen: No, no, no. The employer mandate, which affects only 5 percent of businesses in this country, which is a relatively small part of the overall system."" In this fact-check, we note for the record that Van Hollen shifted from talking about individuals to talking about businesses, and the two should not be confused. However, our focus is on his claim about the number of businesses. We contacted Van Hollen’s office, and the staff there referred us to a couple of key sources. First, the Census Bureau surveys the business community and in 2010, it counted about 5.7 million firms. Of those, about 211,000 had 50 or more employees. Do the math and you find that 3.6 percent of all firms would be subject to the employer mandate. Van Hollen’s other source is a report from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan think tank for Congress. The study published last month found that 96.3 percent of firms would be exempt from the employer mandate because they were too small. Flip that around and 3.7 percent would be affected by the requirement to offer insurance. So if anything, Van Hollen overstated the fraction of firms that would need to worry about the mandate. You have to use a certain amount of care when looking at estimates of the number of firms, because different groups use different methods. The highly respected research center, the Kaiser Family Foundation, reports that 7.3 percent of firms have 50 or more workers. Kaiser, however, only surveys companies with at least three employees. That eliminates more than 2 million firms that the Census Bureau includes. Another widely used source, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, located within the Department of Health and Human Services, produces the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. According to its tally, about 25 percent of all establishments are firms with 50 or more workers. We did not find a clear explanation for these differences, but experts suggested to us that they could be due partly to varying survey methods and partly to varying definitions of establishments (as a place of work) and firms (as a single owner of several establishments). That said, the Census Bureau enjoys broad trust, and we weigh its numbers accordingly. Thomas Buchmueller, an economist at the University of Michigan who has written about the impact of Obamacare on businesses, said the 5 percent figure could be too high for another reason. ""Around 90 percent of firms with 50 or more employees offer health insurance today, and when you get up to 100 employees, coverage is essentially universal,"" Buchmueller said. ""So the mandate will be a binding constraint for a very small number of firms -- the small number of medium-sized firms (say 50 to 99 employees) that currently do not offer insurance and a few more in that size range that might be thinking of dropping coverage."" As one final caveat, looking at the mandate through the lens of business does not tell the whole story. During his television interview, Van Hollen began by talking about the number of people and then brought up the number of companies. As we noted, the two are quite different. According to the Census Bureau, about 72 percent of workers in companies - which is not a complete count of all workers - are in firms with 50 or more employees. While over 90 percent of those firms offer insurance, Christopher Conover, a policy analyst at the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University and an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, cautioned that just because you work at a company that offers insurance, that doesn’t mean you actually get it. ""With 44 percent of working uninsured located in firms with 50-plus employees,"" Conover said, ""it’s obvious that the employees lacking coverage do not work exclusively for the tiny fraction of such firms not offering coverage."" These people might work part time, or might have declined coverage, or they might be waiting to be eligible for coverage. Conover based his findings on the work of the Employee Benefit Research Institute. He said it’s a complicated picture but one that underscores the challenges of implementing Obamacare -- a process that he would like to delay. Our ruling Van Hollen said that 5 percent of businesses would be affected by the employer mandate in the Affordable Care Act. While different surveys produce different numbers, the Census Bureau has been in this line of work longer than any other body, and its data show that 3.6 percent of firms employ 50 or more workers. That is the group for which the mandate would apply; other firms are too small. The Congressional Research Service relied on the Census data. We found no one who challenged the Census numbers. So Van Hollen’s figures are correct. However, his claim focuses our attention on the number of firms, which makes the mandate issue look small. But when seen through the lens of individual workers, it is a bigger deal. How big is difficult to say but the significance is larger than the 5 percent number he used. In PolitiFact terms, the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/18/chris-van-hollen/van-hollen-says-employer-mandate-affects-5-busines/
"['Economy', 'Education', 'Jobs', 'Marriage', 'Texas', 'Barry Smitherman']","
Smitherman partly captures virtual guarantee to escape poverty, but theory also relies on economy being strong
","Take a few steps, Barry Smitherman said, and you won’t live in poverty. Smitherman, seeking the 2014 Republican nomination for Texas attorney general, put his point this way in prepared remarks for an Aug. 26, 2013, appearance before the Texas Alliance for Life: ""Several years ago, the Economist magazine published a piece which said that you only have to do three things to guarantee that you will live above the poverty line—graduate from high school, keep your first job for over 1 year, get married and stay married."" To our request for elaboration, Smitherman, who chairs the Texas Railroad Commission, didn’t come up with the magazine story. But his campaign consultant, Allen Blakemore, told us by email that Smitherman was referring to a 2003 report, ""Work and Marriage; The Way to End Poverty and Welfare,"" by Isabel V. Sawhill and Ron Haskins, senior fellows at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. Sawhill, a former aide to Democratic President Bill Clinton, and Haskins, who assisted Republican President George W. Bush, are co-directors of the institution’s Center on Children and Families. The pair’s September 2003 paper spelled out differences between poor and ""nonpoor"" Americans--specifically that low-income people either do not work or work too few hours to move their families out of poverty and are more likely to be unmarried, lack a high school diploma and have more than two children. Based on data gathered by the U.S Census Bureau and ""simple modeling,"" the paper said, ""we can simulate what would happen to the poverty rate under different assumptions about work, marriage, education and family size among the poor. One can think of these as a series of tests to see which changes in behavior have the biggest effects in reducing the incidence of poverty."" And, according to the paper: lf all non-elderly and non-disabled family heads worked at least full-time, nationally people living in poverty would drop by more than 5 percentage points, from 13 to 7.5 percent. Or if the same proportion of children lived in female-headed families in 2001 as in 1970—""before divorce and out-of-wedlock childbearing dramatically increased the proportion of children living with a single parent""— the poverty rate among families with children decreases by 3.5 percentage points, to 9.5 percent. Or if every family head has at least a high school education and earns at least as much as high school graduates normally receive, the poverty rate among families with children goes down by nearly two percentage points, to 11.1 percent. Or if families had no more than two children, enjoying the same income with fewer mouths to feed, the poverty rate among families with children shrinks by 1.7 percentage points, to 11.3 percent. Finally, the paper said, if each condition were assumed sequentially--such that heads of households kept full-time hours, were married, graduated high school and had no more than two children--the poverty rate would ultimately be 3.7 percent. ""Thus, the poverty rate among families with children could be lowered by 71 percent,"" the paper said. That’s dramatic, but it’s no ""guarantee,"" which is what Smitherman said. By telephone, Brookings spokeswoman D.J. Nordquist told us Haskins and Sawhill made a statement like the one noted by Smitherman in their 2009 book, ""Creating an Opportunity Society,"" whose theme is that completing high school, working full time and marrying before having children--each part described by the authors as a widely endorsed social norm--would ensure almost every American a middle-class income. All told, the authors wrote, Americans ""who finish high school, work full time and marry before having children are virtually guaranteed a place in the middle class. Only about 2 percent of this group ends up in poverty,"" they wrote. ""Conversely, about three-fourths of those who have done none of these three things are poor in any given year."" In another part of the book, the authors said that working full-time is the most powerful factor; in 2007, only 3.5 percent of families with at least one full-time worker were poor, they said. But the authors also noted that in 2007, the national unemployment rate was running at a low 4.6 percent. They wrote, then, that their analysis was ""primarily relevant to the kinds of opportunities that exist in a full-employment economy, not to the kind of economy we entered in 2008,"" a reference to the national recession. So, the virtual guarantee holds only if the economy is roaring? By email, Sawhill called this caveat important. ""The poverty rate has risen from 12.5 to 15 percent as a result of the recession,"" Sawhill said. ""Put differently, it's a lot harder to find full-time work now so it's a lot harder to stay out of poverty."" By phone, she said the virtual ""guarantee"" doesn’t apply when times are tough. Still, Sawhill said, Smitherman’s statement fit the ""spirit of what we argued,"" while having some inaccuracies. The three key factors, she said, were graduating from high school, ""working full-time for a year (not in your first job, but during the year the census data were collected), and being at least 21 and married before you had children.""   Finally, with help from the Economist, we found mention of Sawhill and Haskins in an April 15, 2010, article in the magazine on social mobility. The article quoted them as saying that family background is not unsurmountable. ""In particular, earning a degree and marrying before having children can help someone climb to a higher rung,"" the magazine said. More recently, Jon Fasman of the Economist wrote in an Aug. 24, 2013, article that Haskins and Sawhill ""have found that people who finish high school, work full time and wait to have children until they are married and 21 or older have a 72% chance of joining the middle class and just a 2% chance of being poor. The numbers are reversed for those who violate all three rules."" Our ruling Smitherman said that according to an article in the Economist, Americans are ""guaranteed"" to live above the poverty line if they graduate from high school, keep their first job for over a year and get and stay married. We did not pinpoint what Smitherman saw in the Economist. Setting that aside, Sawhill and Haskins wrote in 2009 that Americans ""who finish high school, work full time and marry before having children are virtually guaranteed a place in the middle class."" The pair did not refer to the import of keeping a first job for any time. Significantly, too, the authors stressed the economy would need to be strong for their hypothetical to fully work; that is, no roaring economy, no guarantee.

St. Petersburg mayor Bill Foster says Tampa gets more federal housing grants because of 'blight scoring system'
","The question for the candidates was simple: What can St. Petersburg’s mayor do to improve severely depressed housing values in Midtown? Mayor Bill Foster and challenger Rick Kriseman both talked about chasing grants to improve the struggling area, which stretches from Second Avenue N to 30th Avenue S and Fourth Street to 34th Street. Kriseman credited Tampa for successfully raking in federal dollars for ""affordable housing initiatives."" He did not elaborate. Foster said Tampa gets more federal money because ""they probably need the money more."" ""Tampa got more money because they scored higher on the blight scoring system, so they've got a much bigger problem than we do,"" Foster said. Intrigued by Foster’s claim, PolitiFact Florida decided to investigate how the cities compare in terms of a ""blight scoring system"" and if Tampa indeed is worse off when compared to St. Petersburg. Is it really more problems, more money? The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, awards billions of dollars in grants to cities, counties and states each year. Some of the awards are known as ""entitlement grants,"" based on formulas. Others are competitive, based on who has the best plan. Allies of Kriseman sounded the alarm on Foster’s response in the forum. To them, Kriseman obviously was talking about a $30 million federal grant the Tampa Housing Authority won last year for Encore Tampa, an urban redevelopment project aiming to transform the Central Park/Ybor neighborhood formerly home to a public housing complex. It wasn’t that Tampa received the Choice Neighborhoods grant over St. Petersburg because it simply has a bigger need for the money. St. Petersburg did not apply for it, even after Foster directed the city’s former contracts and grants officer, Wayne Finley, to explore a similar transformative proposal for the neighborhood around Citrus Grove Apartments at 731 15th St. S. ""It was very clear to me, two years in a row, that he promised to apply,"" said St. Petersburg City Council chairman Karl Nurse, who pushed for the Choice Neighborhoods initiative. It’s accurate to say the city decided not to pursue that grant, a fact confirmed by city and federal officials. But that’s not what Foster said he was talking about when he brought up the scoring system based on ""blight."" In a brief chat, Foster clarified he was talking about a dollar disparity when considering an array of housing and urban improvement grants, not just Choice Neighborhoods. ""I tasked my housing department to advise me on how Tampa is getting grant monies that we are coming for,"" he said. ""Their response was, it’s based upon a scoring system, and Tampa qualified because they had more issues."" There are still issues with what Foster said Problem is, a ""blight scoring system"" does not really exist. A HUD spokesman was perplexed by Foster’s comment, saying there’s no easy comparative analysis for ""blight"" between Tampa and St. Petersburg, or other cities for that matter. But for certain grants, cities get the money based on formulas that take into account an area’s population, poverty and, in some cases, foreclosure picture. Foster had city officials answer our follow-ups. Joshua Johnson, director of the housing department, directed us to fiscal year 2012-13 allocations for Community Development Block Grants, or CDBG. Tampa received $2.8 million and St. Petersburg got $1.6 million. The formula for CDBGs is based on a mix of measures, including population, housing overcrowding, and the extent of residents living in poverty. Tampa exceeds St. Petersburg in all three of those measures, according to HUD data. Normally, Johnson said, if a city has more people, it also has more people who earn lower incomes. According to 2012 Census estimates, Tampa had 347,645 residents, and St. Petersburg had 246,541. Tampa also had a greater share of residents below the poverty level, at 19.2 percent compared to 15.3 percent in St. Petersburg. Foster was trying to articulate that HUD looks at the age and condition of a city's housing stock when considering how to award certain money, and ""clearly if you're going to look at those two factors, blight is part of that,"" said Clarence Scott, city leisure and community services administrator. For instance, the city of St. Petersburg conducted a blight study of the city’s Southside area in pushing to declare it a Community Redevelopment Area. The purpose of that study was just to prove the city is deserving; not to compare it to other places. Similarly, Tampa conducted a blight study in 2006 of the Central Park/Ybor neighborhood that qualified as a CRA and later received the Choice Neighborhoods grant. In 2008, Congress authorized HUD under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act to start the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, which provides grants that help states and local governments rehab, re-sell or demolish foreclosed or abandoned homes. More money was dedicated to the program in the 2009 stimulus package and the 2010 Dodd-Frank banking reforms. Tampa and St. Petersburg each received money for the first and third phases of the program, and Tampa got more -- $18.3 million compared to St. Petersburg’s $13.2 million. The Tampa Housing Authority received a second, competitive grant of $38 million that the city shared to build low-income housing. St. Petersburg tried to win a second-round grant but was not chosen. This program distributes money based on the number of home foreclosures, the number of homes financed by a subprime mortgage loan, and the number of homes in default. ""Perhaps Foster is simply noting, albeit awkwardly, that you can’t fault him for failing to bring in HUD dollars that are based on formulae for which blight and poverty characteristics are key variables,"" said Elizabeth Strom, a University of South Florida urban planning professor. ""But I am not aware of any ‘blight scoring system’ that would be used across programs."" Our ruling Shrugging off the implication that he is sitting back and letting Tampa collect federal affordable housing grants, Foster said Tampa gets more money because they scored higher on the ""blight scoring system."" In the end, Foster is right that Tampa generally gets more money in entitlement grants (not even considering competitive grants). But that’s as much a matter of population and poverty as anything else. A ""blight scoring system"" does not exist by that name. Foster’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/sep/18/bill-foster/st-petersburg-mayor-says-tampa-gets-more-federal-h/

Crossfire’s S.E. Cupp cites CDC on armed citizen safety, gun control laws and buybacks
","Did a report commissioned by the president find ""some very inconvenient facts"" about gun control? Conservative CNN Crossfire host S.E. Cupp broke it down in an episode last week: ""The CDC issued a report commissioned by President (Barack) Obama just earlier this year, and it found some very inconvenient facts. Armed citizens are less likely harmed by attackers. Effectiveness of gun control laws is mixed. Gun buybacks don't work. Shouldn't we be looking at irrefutable evidence, irrefutable evidence?"" Her liberal co-host Van Jones quipped, ""Oh, now Obama's CDC is irrefutable?"" We’ve looked into the state of gun research, which has been starved of federal funding since the late 1990s. Did a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offer strong evidence? The report Cupp mentioned was inspired by mass shootings during 2011 and 2012 in Tucson, Ariz.; Aurora, Colo.; Oak Creek, Wis. and Newtown, Conn. In January 2013, President Barack Obama directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research causes and prevention of gun violence. The agency turned to the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council to bring together experts to come up with a ""research agenda."" They released a 113-page report in June that also summarized what’s known. Rather than break new ground, it focused on the need for more work. ""In the absence of this research, policymakers will be left to debate controversial policies without scientifically sound evidence about their potential effects,"" it said. Later, it urged: ""There is a pressing need to obtain up-to-date, accurate information about how many guns are owned in the United States, their distribution and types, how people acquire them, and how they are used."" Here’s what it noted about armed citizens, gun control laws and gun buybacks. ‘Armed citizens are less likely harmed by attackers’ The research committee summarized research on the ""defensive use of guns."" It did cite specific studies that showed lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims: ""Studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns (i.e., incidents in which a gun was 'used' by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender) have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies,"" it said. It cited four studies, three involving criminal justice professor Gary Kleck of Florida State University, who was on the committee. But it also pointed out that effectiveness of such tactics likely varies depending on the type of victim, offender and circumstance. ""So further research is needed, both to explore these contingencies and to confirm or discount earlier findings,"" the report said. It also pointed out that ""even when defensive use of guns is effective in averting death or injury for the gun user in cases of crime, it is still possible that keeping a gun in the home or carrying a gun in public — concealed or open carry — may have a different net effect on the rate of injury. ""For example, if gun ownership raises the risk of suicide, homicide, or the use of weapons by those who invade homes of gun owners this could cancel or outweigh the beneficial effects of defensive gun use."" It cited three studies from the 1990s by Arthur Kellermann, now a policy analyst at Rand Corp., then said: ""Although some early studies were published that related to this issue, they were not conclusive, and this is a sufficiently important question that it merits additional, careful exploration."" ‘Effectiveness of gun control laws is mixed’ ""Mixed"" definitely describes the state of the research, according to the report, if not the effectiveness of the laws themselves. ""Whether gun restrictions reduce firearm-related violence is an unresolved issue,"" it said, noting that the ""effectiveness of various types of control is inadequately researched."" It goes on to cite studies that fall all over the map. Firearm legislation is associated with lower rates of fatal firearm violence. Except when it’s not. Even studies that show correlation have a hard time showing one thing causes the other. ""A paucity of reliable and valid data, as discussed in the sections above, is a major barrier to the development of the most effective policies, strategies, and interventions for prevention of firearm violence. Nonetheless, many interventions have been developed and studied, and they point to areas requiring important additional research,"" the report finds. Gun buybacks don't work There’s evidence gun buybacks don’t work, the report says. ""For example, in 2009, an estimated 310 million guns were available to civilians in the United States … but gun buyback programs typically recover less than 1,000 guns,"" it said, citing two two studies. It mentioned that on the local level, buybacks may function to raise awareness of gun violence. But it also cited a 2002 study that showed in Milwaukee, Wis., for example, ""guns recovered in the buybacks were not the same guns as those most often used in homicides and suicides."" Our ruling Cupp said that a CDC report this year found: ""Armed citizens are less likely harmed by attackers. Effectiveness of gun control laws is mixed. Gun buybacks don't work."" The report, which summarized the state of gun research and outlined areas for new investigation, cited studies that showed crime victims who used guns had lower injury rates. But it also noted a need to explore other factors and ""confirm or discount"" earlier research. On gun control laws, the research itself is mixed — and there’s a ""paucity of reliable and valid data"" on which to base it. The report did cite evidence that gun buybacks don’t work. Cupp exaggerated the findings of the CDC report, which merely rounded up studies as it argued for more and better research. In most cases, the report was intended to spur more research, not settle controversial claims once and for all.

Group uses kid gun deaths to demand tougher laws
","There’s little that is more tragic than the death of a child. One group recently attempted to use those emotions to sway a prominent Georgia lawmaker to its side in the national gun legislation debate. Mayors Against Illegal Guns sent backpacks to the Atlanta office of U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss that were filled with postcards calling on him to support ""comprehensive, life-saving background checks on all commercial gun sales."" ""[S]even backpacks will be dropped to represent the seven children and young people who are murdered with guns every day in America,"" the Mayors Against Illegal Guns news release reads. ""Every day, 33 Americans are murdered with guns in America — and seven of those are children."" PolitiFact Georgia read about this on the website Georgia Unfiltered and wondered whether Mayors Against Illegal Guns was correct about how many children were shot and killed every day in America. Mayors Against Illegal Guns was co-founded in 2006 by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. The coalition wants legislation passed that would require background checks on all gun sales. It claims more than 1,000 members across political party lines. Georgia mayors in the organization include Atlanta’s Kasim Reed, Roswell’s Jere Wood and Earnestine Pittman of East Point. The coalition has been pressuring senators such as Chambliss who’ve either been on the fence or against gun bills it supports. Chambliss voted against a gun-control measure earlier this year. That amendment  would have allowed a vote on a measure to require nearly all gun buyers to undergo background checks. The coalition said it based its claim on data from the Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It also noted that other organizations, such as the Children’s Defense Fund, have touted similar numbers. In July, the Children’s Defense Fund released a report that found 2,694 children and teens were killed by guns in 2010. That’s an average of 7.4 deaths a day. Raymonde Charles, a spokeswoman for the CDF, said it began compiling such data on its own 20 years ago and noted it refers to this age group as ""children and teens"" to reflect that its data include 18- and 19-year-olds. Here’s a chart the mayors coalition shared with PolitiFact:   Year Gun homicides 0-20 Gun deaths 0-20 2006 2,813 4,064 2007 2,725 3,871 2008 2,597 3,777 2009 2,352 3,539 2010 2,308 3,459 Average 2,559 3,742 Per day 7.0 10.3 We looked at the CDC site and did a search for how many people 18 and under were killed in homicides by guns in each of those years. The numbers do not include suicides. A CDC spokesman confirmed that is the best way to research such information. Here were the totals: 2006:        1,629 2007:        1,568 2008:        1,486 2009:        1,359 2010:        1,260 That’s a total of 7,302 deaths, an average of four a day. Yes, we included the extra day in 2008 for our calculation. An average of four children killed by homicides from guns a day is troubling, but it is substantially less than seven a day. We asked the coalition why it decided to use those 20 and younger for its claim as opposed to 18 and under. Some may not consider anyone older than 16 a child, since that’s the age most states allow someone to get a driver’s license or get married (with parental consent). The coalition said it included victims under 21 because they cannot legally buy firearms or possess a gun in some states. ""The unfortunate reality is that the most recent CDC research shows that we lose seven children - not yet twenty one years old - to gun violence every day in America,"" Mark Glaze, the executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in a statement to PolitiFact Georgia. ""These are young people - treated as minors under many of our laws - who won't see their twenty-first birthday because Congress won't pass the common-sense laws that a big majority of parents are calling for."" To sum up, Mayors Against Illegal Guns said in a news release to U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, in an effort to encourage him to support legislation that the group believes would keep firearms out of the wrong hands, that seven children are killed by guns every day. The coalition should have been more specific by saying it was referring to people under the age of 21. We believe that information would add significant context for those who may not believe anyone older than 16 or 18 is a child. The Children’s Defense Fund was more specific, noting its total included children and teenagers. The coalition’s claim is accurate, but it omits some important details.

Gov. Scott Walker says the policies of Democrat Jim Doyle cost the state 133,000 jobs
","Gov. Scott Walker took an early swipe at a likely Democratic opponent, by criticizing his predecessor’s record on jobs. On Aug. 30, 2013, Walker brought up jobs when discussing Democrat Mary Burke, who is considering a gubernatorial run in 2014. A former Trek bicycles executive, Burke served as state commerce secretary for two and a half years under former Gov. Jim Doyle. Walker,  who has not officially launched his re-election campaign, said in an interview with Wisconsin Eye that electing Burke would be a mistake and a return to the past. Burke, he said, ""implemented the policies of Jim Doyle. Those are the policies that, in his last term, saw the state lose more than 133,000 jobs."" We’ve been tracking Walker’s promise to create 250,000 private sector jobs in his four-year term. The state has added 84,482 jobs in the two and a half years since Walker took office, according to our most recent monthly Walk-O-Meter update. But what about the governor’s claim that the policies of Doyle cost the state more than 133,000 jobs in the previous four years? Let’s start with the numbers. Doyle’s second term was from 2006 to 2010. At the start of that time frame, Wisconsin had 2,404,928 jobs, according to the state Department of Workforce Development. Four years later, when Doyle left office, the state had 133,943 fewer jobs. So Walker is on point on the raw number of jobs lost in Doyle’s final term. But Walker’s claim was about more than the numbers. In going after Burke -- Commerce Secretary from 2005 until the end of 2007 -- he attributed the loss to the policies of the Doyle administration. To support his claim, Walker’s office provided an email statement, links to news clippings and portions of an ""issue book"" produced by state Senate Republicans in for the 2009-’10 term. ""Governor Doyle’s vision for Wisconsin included bigger government, the use of one-time funds and budget gimmicks (raid of segregated funds), out-of-control spending, and tax increases,"" said the email from Walker spokesman Tom Evenson.  ""These policies led to an environment unfriendly to workers and job creators and contributed to the loss of over 133,000 jobs in his last term."" The email also said that under Doyle, the state raised taxes by ""nearly $5 billion and used one-time stimulus money to fill a budget hole."" ""These taxes fell on employers both directly and indirectly as well as on working families taking away more of their hard-earned income and sending it to Madison.  Also, employers and others knew that using one-time money would grow future deficits which could fall on them in the form of higher taxes."" The email states: ""These actions contributed to Wisconsin’s job loss of more than 133,000 private sector jobs."" Let’s pause right there. In the Wisconsin Eye interview, the governor said that Doyle administration policies were responsible for the job losses. The statement from Evenson says only the actions ""contributed"" to the job losses. The view from experts When we asked several experts for their view on the 2006-’10 employment situation in Wisconsin, all had the same general observation: In that period, the U.S. economy suffered the worst economic downturn in more than 75 years -- and Wisconsin was not immune. In fact, they said, Wisconsin fared somewhat better than the country as a whole. ""I'm pretty sure there is plenty of blame to be shared by a lot of people, but it might be unfair to pin it all on one person or administration,"" said Brian Jacobsen, an economist at Wells Fargo Bank and lecturer at Wisconsin Lutheran College. ""Considering employment in Wisconsin declined 5.3% during that time while U.S. employment declined 5.6%, blaming it on Doyle might not be all that fair."" Jacobsen said the jobs decline ""probably wasn't exaggerated by Doyle's policies.  If his policies were to blame, we probably would have seen a larger percentage decline in employment in Wisconsin.  I do think it is fair to criticize previous policy decisions, especially related to tax policy, in making the bounce back tougher."" In a previous PolitiFact item about the recession, Jacobsen noted that the National Bureau of Economic Research, which declares the start and end of recessions, says ""economic activity in the U.S. peaked in December 2007 and reached a trough in June 2009."" Marquette University economics professor Abdur Chowdhury attributed the loss of jobs mainly to the Great Recession. ""If you think about it, Wisconsin fared much better than many other states -- the total U.S. job loss during the Great Recession was about 8 million and Wisconsin's share was less than 200,000,"" he said. ""I wouldn't blame the Doyle administration solely for this job loss. In the face of a national economic collapse, there wasn't much that the Doyle administration -- or, for that matter, any other administration -- could do."" We also checked with Richard Freeman, a Harvard University professor and the director of the the National Bureau of Economic Research, the organization that determines, among other things, the official start and end of recessions. He also said the key to understanding the state’s performance during the recession was that Wisconsin’s job loss was smaller than the rest of the country. Freeman’s time frame differs slightly from the others but his conclusion was the same: ""Wisconsin had 2.132% of (the nation’s) private-sector jobs in 2007 and 2.149% of those jobs in 2010.  This means that Wisconsin had a smaller job loss than other states."" Freeman added: ""I doubt that state government had much impact on private sector job loss.""   Our rating Walker said that the policies of Doyle, his predecessor, led to the loss of more than 133,000 jobs in Doyle’s last term. He’s correct about the number. But experts agree that Wisconsin’s economy was caught in the same economic crash that crippled the entire country -- the recession was deeper and more severe than any single state’s policies, including those of Doyle. They note that Wisconsin actually fared somewhat better than the rest of the country. This leaves us with a statement that’s numerically true, but with scant evidence at best when it comes to blame. That’s Mostly False on our meter. To comment on this item, visit this page.",/factchecks/2013/sep/18/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-policies-democrat-jim-doyle-/

Bloggers say Warren Buffett recently turned against Obamacare
","Conservative Internet bloggers are turning up three-year-old quotes from Warren Buffett and casting them as fresh evidence that American support is dwindling for President Barack Obama's health care law.

But the quotes are not properly identified as three years old and do not reflect Buffett's full thinking on the health care law.

It's unclear why or how the old quotes resurfaced.

But we started seeing the Buffett quotes in Facebook feeds on the morning of Sept. 17, 2013, after the Weekly Standard linked to it, starting its blog post, ""You know things are bad for President Obama when even Warren Buffett has soured on Obamacare and says that 'we need something else.' ""

The link went to a website called Money Morning, which posted an entry on Sept. 13 titled, ""Buffett: Scrap Obamacare and Start All Over.""

The post on the website includes quotes from Buffett, including:

• ""Health care costs in the United States are like a tapeworm eating at our economic body.""

• ""We have a health system that, in terms of costs, is really out of control. And if you take this line and you project what has been happening into the future, we will get less and less competitive. So we need something else.""

• ""Attack the costs first, and then worry about expanding coverage. I would much rather see another plan that really attacks costs. And I think that's what the American public wants to see. I mean, the American public is not behind this bill.""

The post goes on to paraphrase Buffett as saying he would scrap Obamacare and start over. A variety of other conservative media outlets spotlighted the post in the past week as a development in the ongoing battle over the health care law, such as Wall Street Journal blogger James Taranto and Newsbusters. But the comments come from an interview that Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., gave to CNBC on March 1, 2010 -- three and a half years ago, before the bill was signed. Buffett's office told PolitiFact that the blog reports do not reflect his views. Buffett ""has never said or thought that Obamacare should be scrapped,"" said Debbie Bosanek, Buffett's assistant. She said she showed him our research and that he said our analysis ""covered it very well."" So what did Buffett say in 2010? They can be found in a Politico article published at the time that summarized the interview. That article also includes other tidbits excluded from the more recent blog posts that paint a more nuanced picture of his views. • Buffett was referring to a bill that was still pending in Congress. At the time of his comments, a bill had passed the Senate, but lawmakers were still deciding how to get it through the House, so he’d have reason to think his comments might carry some weight in bargaining over details. He was not referring to the law after it was on the books, and he did not make his comments with three and a half years of hindsight from looking at its implementation. • Buffett said the bill he was criticizing was still worth passing despite its imperfections. According to Politico, Buffett was asked on CNBC whether he would be in favor of scrapping the Senate’s version of the health care bill; he responded: ""I would be."" However, Politico also noted ""that while he does not like the Senate bill, he’d vote for it in preference to doing nothing."" Buffett said in the interview, ""If it was a choice today between plan A, which is what we've got, or plan B, … the Senate bill, I would vote for the Senate bill. But I would much rather see a plan C that really attacks costs."" It’s worth noting that in July 2012, just after the Supreme Court upheld the health care law, Buffett told Bloomberg TV that the court made the right decision. Invoking the same metaphor, Buffett said health care is ""the tapeworm, essentially, of the American economy, and we have not dealt with that yet."" But he added, ""Obamacare is a step in the right direction in many ways."" Shortly after we started looking into the blog posts, the Weekly Standard added an ""update"" to its post. It said, ""It appears that Buffett made his anti-Obamacare comments in 2010, thereby showing that he, like most of the American people, has opposed Obamacare since even before it was passed — a point that Mark Hemingway addressed yesterday in response to USA Today’s implication that Americans’ widespread dislike of Obamacare is mostly attributable to Republicans’ efforts to fight it."" We sent inquiries to the Weekly Standard and Money Morning but did not hear back. We also sent an inquiry to Buffett and will publish a comment if he offers one. Our ruling A variety of blogs reprinted an item indicating that Warren Buffett recently said ""Scrap Obamacare and Start All Over."" However, the comments came from an interview in 2010, when the health care bill was still being debated, and are not based on the subsequent three and a half years of seeing the law implemented. If anything, comments by Buffett in 2012 suggest that he’s pleased to see the law being put into effect, despite the shortcomings he sees. The notion that Buffett had recently turned on a president he supported by souring on his signature health care law could have been easily debunked using Google searches.

Van Jones says just 1 percent of NRA-endorsed candidates won in 2012
","Both supporters and critics of the National Rifle Association have acknowledged that the pro-gun group flexes significant political muscle. But Van Jones, one of the hosts of CNN’s Crossfire, suggested in a recent show that the NRA’s reputation of invincibility is exaggerated. ""The NRA is not popular on a big scale,"" Jones said. ""They can cherry-pick their focus. ... 1 percent of candidates that they endorsed in 2012 won -- 1 percent."" We wondered whether the NRA was really as ineffectual in 2012 as Jones suggested. Neither Jones nor the NRA responded to inquiries for this story, but we suspect that Jones was referring to research released after the 2012 election by the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit group that tracks money in politics. The foundation looked at a variety of politically active groups to determine how much of the money they spent on the 2012 election was directed toward supporting candidates who won or opposing candidates who lost, as opposed to money spent on candidates who lost or against candidates who won. The foundation then produced a ""return on investment"" -- the percentage of the group’s money that was spent on races that ended with the group’s desired result. In 2012, a year when President Barack Obama won a second term and the Democrats held the Senate, a number of liberal groups fared well on this score: Affiliates of Planned Parenthood, the Service Employees International Union and the League of Conservation Voters finished with returns on investment of 80 percent and higher. By contrast, conservative or pro-business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce or the Karl Rove-founded American Crossroads finished with percentages in the single digits. So how did the NRA do? Sunlight looked at two of its affiliates -- the Political Victory Fund and the Institute for Legislative Action. (The two groups are organized under different parts of the tax code, but they have the same goal -- promoting candidates who support the NRA’s agenda.) According to Sunlight, the Political Victory Fund spent $11,159,493 but generated a minuscule 0.83 percent return on investment. A big reason for the poor showing was that more than four of every five dollars the group spent was either against Obama or for Mitt Romney in the presidential race, and of course Obama won. Meanwhile, the return on investment for the $7,448,017 spent by the Institute for Legislative Action was a bit higher -- 10.74 percent. So right off the bat, Jones’ summary is misleading -- one of the two NRA affiliates produced a success rate of better than 1 percent. But we see an even bigger concern: Jones was talking about endorsements, but the Sunlight Foundation was looking at money. And the NRA has endorsed candidates without necessarily spending money. In fact, while receiving money from the NRA is nice for any candidate that supports its goals, an NRA endorsement even in the absence of money is a treasured asset. Once an endorsement is made, a candidate can reap benefits among voters who trust the NRA. It can be touted on a campaign’s lawn signs, at candidate forums, in newspaper profiles and on social media. To more accurately gauge Jones’ claim about endorsements, we tried to assemble a more complete list of endorsements, regardless of whether they came attached to money. First, we tallied the number of candidates who had received funding (or found themselves targets of opposition funding) from either of the two NRA affiliates. Then we added any additional candidates for whom the NRA issued an endorsement news release in 2012. To remain in tune with Sunlight’s methodology, we limited our list to federal candidates only. Ultimately, we found 49 NRA endorsements that ended up as ""failures"" -- that is, where the group backed a losing candidate or failed to defeat a candidate they opposed. But the NRA notched an even higher number of ""successes"" in 2012 -- 72 candidates that the group helped carry to victory, or that it helped defeat. That’s about a 60 percent success rate for endorsements -- far higher than the 1 percent Jones cited. Our ruling Jones said ""1 percent of candidates that (the National Rifle Association) endorsed in 2012 won."" An independent analysis did find that about 1 percent of money spent by one particular NRA affiliate either helped elect a winning candidate or helped defeat a losing one. But that ignores a second NRA affiliate that did much better, and the study in question looked at dollars spent -- not endorsements. From the data we compiled, the NRA’s endorsements were about 60 percent successful. We rate Jones’ claim False.",/factchecks/2013/sep/17/van-jones/van-jones-says-just-1-percent-nra-endorsed-candida/

Garden State Democrat compares Texas jobless rates for two months to deliver incomplete picture of joblessness on Rick Perry's watch
","A New Jersey Democrat recently proclaimed similarities between the Republican governors of the Garden State and Texas, saying Chris Christie and Rick Perry both have hurt women, families and their respective state’s economy. John Currie, who chairs the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, aired his criticisms in a Sept. 9, 2013, guest post on a blog, the Austin-based, pro-Democratic Burnt Orange Report. Noting that Christie was making a Texas political fundraising trip, Currie took Perry to task for fresh abortion restrictions he signed into law as well as cuts in public school spending approved in 2011. Currie also touched on the state’s high ranking in residents paid the minimum wage; in August 2011, we rated such a claim as True. But the Currie claim that drew the Texas Truth-O-Meter had to do with more Texans being jobless than before Perry became governor. Currie wrote: ""After over a decade in office, the unemployment rate in Texas has risen by over two (percentage) points,"" according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. ""When he (Perry) took office in January 2001, the unemployment rate there was 4.2 percent. As of this summer, it is 6.5 percent."" Perry, governor since late 2000, has long touted Texas’ job gains. Along those lines, we’ve quoted Pia Orrenius, a senior economist for the Federal Reserve branch in Dallas, as saying that some of the favorable economic factors in Texas are its booming Gulf ports and its surging trade with Mexico and China. Orrenius also ranks among experts who have told us that job gains and losses in a state aren’t controlled by whoever is governor. Orrenius said in June 2011: ""Long before Rick Perry (became governor), we were talking about the great Texas economy."" Still, did joblessness get worse on Perry’s watch? To our inquiry, Cheryl Abbot, a BLS regional economist, emailed charts showing that the Texas unemployment rate was 4.2 percent in January 2001, Perry’s first full month as governor. The state’s jobless rate was 6.5 percent in July 2013, the latest month for which the bureau calculated a rate before Currie’s article appeared. There’s a 2.3 percentage point difference. A refresher: The unemployment rate, based on government surveys, reflects the estimated share of adults hunting for work who say they are unemployed. In January 2001, by this measure, nearly 443,000 Texas adults in the state workforce of nearly 10.5 million were jobless, according to the bureau. In June 2013, the latest month for which the bureau had comparable figures, 831,850 adults were unemployed in the workforce of nearly 12.8 million, the bureau says. According to the government surveys, nearly 12 million Texans had jobs in June 2013 compared with 10 million in January 2001. There are other substantive wrinkles to consider. For instance, the Texas jobless rate didn’t steadily surge from the New Jerseyan’s cited 4.2 percent to 6.5 percent. Instead, according to the bureau, the rate essentially went up, then down, then up, then down, then up. Specifically, the rate rose to 6.9 percent as of June and July 2003; decreased to 4.3 percent for April through September 2007; increased to 8.3 percent in February and March 2010; and then fell or decreased most months from April 2010 to December 2012 when it was 6.2 percent. In 2013, it went from 6.3 percent in January to 6.5 percent in May through July. Other aspects: The Texas unemployment rate exceeded the national jobless rate for the first 70-plus months of Perry’s governorship, according to the bureau, but the rate has trailed the national rate since January 2007, or for 79 months. The national rate was 7.4 percent in July 2013, the bureau says. Abbot, asked to elaborate on the changes, replied: ""For the most part, Texas (and all other states) followed the national pattern as far as unemployment rates are concerned. When the economy was doing well, unemployment rates were low and when the economy was doing poorly, jobless rates were high. Where the state differences manifest themselves is in the specific timing of upturns and downturns and the magnitude of change in their unemployment rates,"" she wrote. ""Some states entered the"" latest ""recession later than others."" By telephone, Bernard ""Bud"" Weinstein, a Southern Methodist University economist, said he prefers to judge economies by federal surveys of employers indicating how many individuals are on payrolls rather than depending on household surveys behind the unemployment rates. ""How many people are bringing home regular paychecks?"" Weinstein said. At our request, BLS economist James B. Howard Jr. emailed a chart reflecting results of the payroll surveys. It indicated that more than 9.5 million individuals were on Texas payrolls in January 2001, while nearly 11.2 million were on payrolls in July 2013, the difference being 17 percent. Nationally, according to the bureau, the nation had about 3 percent more individuals on payrolls in July 2013 (136 million people) compared to January 2001 (133 million). Weinstein said too that it remains questionable how much a governor controls economic conditions, which would include unemployment. Many other individuals and factors come into play, he said, of late including the financial collapse on Wall Street, the housing bust and credit difficulties. ""Economies are global,"" Weinstein said. Our ruling Currie said unemployment has risen more than two percentage points during Perry’s governorship. This is supported by cherry-picking the latest available Texas jobless rate, 6.5 percent for July 2013, and comparing it to the 4.2 percent rate in January 2001, Perry’s first full month as governor. But this delivers an incomplete picture given that the state’s jobless rate bounced around through the 12-plus years. One can also note, for instance, that the 2013 monthly rates have been lower than the Perry-era high of 8.3 percent in early 2010. Also, the Texas rate has trailed the national rate for more than six years. Finally, it’s not reasonable to blame (or credit) a governor for a state’s unemployment rate. How an economy fares is not determined by the state’s chief elected official.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'David Dewhurst']","
Dewhurst not the sole businessman among state officials
","As a businessman, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst claimed in an Aug. 19, 2013, interview, he knows how to keep Texas’ job growth going. ""Soy un hombre de negocios, el único official estatal quién es un hombre de negocios,"" he said on the Houston Univision 45 show ""Conexión Texas"" – ""I am a businessman, the only state official who is a businessman."" Dewhurst, whose fluency in Spanish dates to his 1970-74 Central Intelligence Agency posting in Bolivia, phrased the same claim in a tighter way in another part of the interview, saying he is the only state elected official who is a businessman: ""Yo soy el único hombre de negocios eligido estatal."" Currently running to keep his job as lieutenant governor, a post he’s held since 2003, Dewhurst makes a similar statement on his campaign website, saying he’s ""the only businessman elected to statewide office."" D magazine quoted Dewhurst in a June 23, 2011, blog post, as saying, ""Out of 29 elected state officials, I’m the only traditional businessman."" Dewhurst built a multimillion-dollar fortune as an energy entrepreneur and investor in Houston after his service in the Air Force and CIA. According to Spanish-English dictionaries and consultation with our colleagues at the Austin American-Statesman’s weekly Spanish newspaper, ¡Ahora Sí!, the adjective ""estatal"" would translate simply as ""state."" By email, Dewhurst campaign spokesman Travis Considine told us that a June 29, 2013, quotation in a Dallas Morning News news blog post represented what Dewhurst ""typically says in English"": ""I’m the only traditional businessperson elected statewide."" In the ""Conexión"" interview, Considine told us, Dewhurst was referring to Gov. Rick Perry, Attorney General Greg Abbott, Comptroller Susan Combs, Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson and Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples, whose occupations Considine said were, respectively, rancher, lawyer, rancher, retired military and rancher. The Texas secretary of state’s office lists 27 statewide elected positions, and the Texas Legislature has 31 senators and 150 representatives, who are members of state government and make state law even though they are elected from regions rather than statewide. We pulled together information on Texas officials’ occupations from news stories, biographies on state websites and interviews with officeholders’ aides. A full list of sources is at right. Texas’ top statewide offices Among the five executive statewide elected officials Considine named, Staples describes himself as a ""former rancher and businessman"" on his campaign website. Staples, retired Marine Lt. Col. Patterson and state Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston, a radio host and station owner, are each challenging Dewhurst for the 2014 Republican nomination for lieutenant governor. Staples’ campaign manager, Cody McGregor, told us by phone that Staples started and owned a real estate firm from 1986 until 2007, was part owner of a plant nursery and started and ran a cattle-raising operation. Before entering public service, Perry farmed cotton and wheat, raised cattle and served in the Air Force, according to news stories from the Austin American-Statesman archives and NPR. Spokespeople told us by email that Abbott is a lawyer and Combs was a lawyer and rancher. All statewide offices in Texas Among the 27 state officials elected statewide, we spotted an accountant and an investment banker. That group includes the officials above plus the Texas Railroad Commission’s three members, the Texas Supreme Court’s nine justices and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals’ nine judges. Members of those courts are lawyers and judges, as required by state law -- specifically, each must have 10 years’ experience as a practicing lawyer or judge. Railroad Commission chairman Barry Smitherman, a candidate for attorney general, was an investment banker and briefly a prosecutor in the Harris County District Attorney’s office, according to a June 26, 2013, Texas Tribune news story. His colleagues are Christi Craddick, described in her biographical entry on the commission’s website and Statesman stories as an oil and gas lawyer and former advisor to her father, then-House Speaker Tom Craddick; and David Porter, an accountant whose biographical entry says he ""built a successful small business around his CPA practice."" Adding in Texas’ two U.S. senators, federal officials elected statewide, would bump the number up to 29, matching Dewhurst’s 2011 statement. Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz are lawyers. State legislators The Senate’s official guide to senators and the House Chief Clerk’s Office list of representatives’ biographical data give business as an occupation for dozens of members of the current (83rd) Legislature. Others are listed more specifically as owning companies, restaurants, agencies or firms. Here, too, ""lawyer"" is a common occupation, but there are also engineers, contractors, educators, insurance agents, ranchers and doctors. Our ruling Dewhurst said he’s ""el único official estatal quién es un hombre de negocios,"" which his camp would translate as ""the only statewide elected official who is a businessman."" This claim falls down without going beyond the five executive offices that his spokesman said Dewhurst was referring to. Past that, the claim is incorrect in a commonsensical way, if one accepts, as we do, that legislators are elected state officials as well. Dozens of legislators are in business.

"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'John Cornyn']","
Sen. John Cornyn quoted saying hearings needed on citizenship provision; did he later crawfish?
","
U.S. Sen. John Cornyn ""'crawfishing'"" says a headline on an Aug. 30 web post by Tyler's KETK-TV.

It's not describing the Texas senator's vacation plans. Instead, the headline suggests Cornyn backing off on favoring hearings on the constitutional provision entitling anyone born in the United States to citizenship. 
We wondered.

The station's report says Cornyn was at a port of entry in Hidalgo, Texas Aug. 27 when he backed off ""his earlier support for Congress reviewing birthright citizenship."" The report quotes Cornyn saying that taking another look at the Constitution's 14th Amendment amid the national debate over immigration ""is going after a symptom rather than the cause in the first place."" (A symptom or cause of what, the report did not specify.) Cornyn previously backed calls for a review.

Next, we contacted Cornyn's office, where spokesman Kevin McLaughlin said in an e-mail that the senator wasn't airing a new position. Rather, McLaughlin said, the original report on Cornyn's position, in the Aug. 5 Dallas Morning News, misrepresented Cornyn's willingness to participate in hearings as advocating them.

The News' article describes Cornyn as the latest senator to call for a review of birthright citizenship amid complaints that illegal immigrants have abused that post-Civil War constitutional provision. The story notes that Sen. John Kyl, R-Arizona, had earlier suggested hearings in a TV interview and the Senate minority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, subsequently did the same.

""We need to have hearings,"" Cornyn is quoted saying. ""We need to consult constitutional scholars and study what the implications are."" Cornyn is the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and Border Security.

According to the News article, Cornyn said, ""It's certainly within the power of Congress to"" make changes either by statute or amending the constitution. But he is also quoted saying, ""We need to tread carefully in this area, because we would be changing, frankly, settled law.""

McLaughlin said he watched the interview and that Cornyn didn't call for a review of the 14th Amendment but instead responded to the reporter's request for comment on that possibility. The ""point (Cornyn) was making was not that he supported or opposed a review. His point was that if any of his colleagues want to change the Constitution, we should proceed with great caution and at least have hearings,"" McLaughlin said.

We asked if the senator sought a correction or clarification from the newspaper. McLaughlin said not, adding in an e-mail: ""They are pointless because papers bury them and no one reads them.""

From our review, it looks like the News' article had an impact on other coverage. From early August through Aug. 22, the Hotline, UPI, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and Politico.com referred to Cornyn as calling for or supporting hearings on birthright citizenship.

Later on the very day of the Morning News' interview, McLaughlin said, Cornyn was in a conference call with reporters and answered a question about changing the 14th Amendment. McLaughlin shared a recording of Cornyn's answer, in which the senator again talked about treading ""carefully."" He said he'd want to take up the topic in the context of broad immigration reform; there's no mention of his position on holding hearings.

McLaughlin said Cornyn's position was clearly spelled out in an Aug. 12 story in The McAllen Monitor, which quotes Cornyn saying that if members of both parties want to pursue the issue, he'd support hearings at least to air out the social and legal implications. ""I would hope that (committees) would hear from a diverse group of people, including legal scholars, advocacy groups and ordinary citizens, including a lot of Texans,"" Cornyn said in a statement to the newspaper. ""We don’t need to amend the Constitution to secure the border and reform a broken immigration system."" The same day, the El Paso Times quoted a similar Cornyn statement.

McLaughlin also pointed to an Aug. 27 Associated Press recap of Cornyn's latest remarks. According to the AP, Cornyn backed off his earlier support for Congress taking up birthright citizenship, but also told reporters his new remarks didn't reflect a shift in stance.

Cornyn is quoted saying: ""I was asked a question whether I would participate in hearings on the issue. And I said, 'Well, sure, I'm happy to do my job and listen to expert witnesses.' But upon further reflection I really think it is a symptom and not the cause.""

Recap: On Aug. 4, Cornyn told the Morning News ""we need to have hearings"" on the 14th Amendment, consult with scholars and study the issue but also should ""tread carefully,"" a caution he also expressed in response to another reporter's question that day. Later, separate newspaper articles quoted him saying there's no need to amend the Constitution to address comprehensive immigration reform, a position he aired again on his recent trip to the Texas-Mexico border.

Best we can tell, the stated ""need"" to hold hearings on the amendment wasn't repeated by Cornyn. His mention that he has given it ""further reflection"" underscores he's not as keen on the idea as he appeared to be in the oft-referenced Morning News' story. Yet Cornyn also hasn't gone so far as to say he's now against hearings.

"['Georgia', 'Environment', 'Energy', 'Stephen Kretzmann']","
Senators side with ""big oil,"" critic says
","
Are Georgia's two U.S. senators too beholden to ""Big Oil"" companies?

That's the claim on a website created by Oil Change International, critical about the positions of some U.S. senators on some oil and energy issues. The site, www.bobbinginpetroleum.org, has images of 46 senators, including Georgia's Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson.

Make no mistake, Oil Change International has an agenda. It identifies itself on its website as ""a research and advocacy organization that exists to force progress in the energy industry towards an environmentally and socially sustainable energy future."" The website also proclaims that the tax-exempt organization ""campaigns to expose the true costs of oil and facilitate the coming transition towards clean energy. We are dedicated to identifying and overcoming political barriers to that transition.""

The website says Chambliss and Isakson have accepted a combined $331,000 in what it dubbed ""dirty energy contributions."" The largest contributor, about $128,000, was Atlanta-based Southern Co.

For visual effect, the heads and torsos of the two senators are floating in rubber duckies in oil-stained water. An oil barrel is in the background.

AJC PolitiFact Georgia certainly could not ignore an opportunity to dive deeper into this website. We also wanted to know if Chambliss and Isakson voted for legislation that ""gut clear air protections and increase oil dependence.""

We reached out to the offices of both senators to see if they disputed the claims against their bosses. Both defended their votes in favor of legislation the website criticized. Isakson's Senate seat is up for re-election on Nov. 2.

We decided to dig deeper into the claim about the resolution, since the staff of both senators seemed to have a larger beef with that.

The legislation in question was written by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska. It aimed to prevent the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from formulating regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The first of the new regulations could take effect in 2011. Murkowski argued Congress needs more input in the process, but her bill failed by a 53 to 47 vote. If Murkowski's resolution had been approved, some activists argued it would have a negative impact on clean air regulations. Bobbing in Petroleum called the legislation the ""Big Oil Bailout.""

Chambliss and Isakson argued in support of the legislation largely on economic grounds. The legislation was a skirmish in the ongoing battle in Washington over efforts to pass sweeping energy legislation. The House passed a bill last year to establish a cap on carbon emissions, but the legislation has run into firm opposition in the Senate. Many Republican leaders say the so-called ""cap and trade"" legislation would become a job-killing tax. Pass the legislation, they argue, and you put Americans out of work.

""This backdoor attempt to regulate greenhouse gases will have dramatic negative effects on our manufacturing sector while also causing significant increases in the cost of power generation,"" Isakson said in a statement after the June 10 vote.

Chambliss said in a speech on the Senate floor that day that the EPA's actions would require more cash-strapped farmers to get federal Clean Air Act permits, hurting many of them financially.

So would the Murkowski bill ""gut clean air protections and increase oil dependence""?

First, we must go back to 2007. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 vote that the EPA must consider putting controls on carbon dioxide and other gases in automobile exhaust. The majority rejected arguments by the administration of then-President George W. Bush, a Republican, that the Clean Air Act does not treat carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases as ""pollutants,"" and thus does not give the EPA the authority to regulate them.

In September 2009, the EPA, under the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, announced plans to require better gas mileage for cars and trucks and the first-ever rules on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson wants to establish a greenhouse gas emission for cars and light trucks in model years 2012 to 2016.

Murkowski introduced her legislation in January to stop the EPA effort.

Stephen Kretzmann, who created the Bobbing in Petroleum site, said the EPA regulations would reduce automotive oil consumption by more than 1.8 billion barrels, citing comments Jackson made in a statement to a House of Representatives energy subcommittee.

""Eliminating the EPA standard would forfeit ... one-third of its greenhouse gas emissions reductions,"" Jackson said.

Kretzmann also noted a letter by former EPA Administrator Russell Train urging the Senate to vote down the Murkowski bill. Train said the legislation would roll back Clean Air Act protections.

""If Congress had removed EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gases, industry would have been on more solid ground to challenge them in the future. And I have no doubt that they will, if given the chance,"" said Kretzmann, who said he's worked on energy and oil issues for nearly two decades.
 
Jonas Monast, who has expertise in federal climate protection policies, agreed Murkowski's legislation would adversely impact the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. However, he said it would not impact U.S. Department of Transportation's ability to increase vehicle efficiency, a point that's been made by other nonpartisan observers. Cars, buses and trucks account for about half of all cancers attributed to outdoor sources of air toxins, federal officials say. The EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are working on a new rating system that rates the overall fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions of different vehicles to help consumers before buying a new car, SUV, truck or van.

Would the bill increase oil dependence?

""I don't think it's possible to predict at this point,"" said Monast, senior policy counsel at the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Studies at Duke University.

Obama announced in May a plan to impose mileage and pollution limits on vehicles, particularly SUVs and trucks. Obama used the BP oil spill to highlight the need to rely less on fossil fuels. The EPA argued Murkowski's resolution would hurt the president's plan and continue America's dependence on foreign oil. Murkowski argued her resolution would not impact the federal Department of Transportation's ability to regulate fuel efficiency.

Every expert we talked to said the Murkowski legislation would hurt the EPA's efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. But the experts also said it would not impact federal transportation officials from moving forward with efforts to increase vehicle efficiency. Whether or not the bill would increase oil dependence is still debatable.

Gardiner says war costs in Afghanistan are triple ""any other place""
","
All three Republican candidates in the 2nd Congressional District were at the Aug. 30 debate produced by Channel 6 and carried on Cox Cable Channel 5, also known as the Rhode Island News Channel.

Early on, the three men were asked for specifics regarding how they would cut the federal budget. Candidate Michael Gardiner singled out the high cost of fighting in Afghanistan.

""It costs us, logistically, three times more to fight in Afghanistan than it does in any other place. Really,"" he said. ""So we really need to lower our expectations there and save the lives and save the war costs and bring that money home to rebuild America.""

Thirty seconds later, he repeated that assertion.

We did a quick Google search, hoping to find the source of that number, and drew a blank.

So we called Gardiner. He said he came across it while surfing the Internet. ""I'm looking for information constantly."" But he didn't remember where he saw it.

""Because of the location, I guess it's landlocked in central Asia, it cost three times more to fight there than it does in Iraq. I said anywhere else. I was being a little bit loose. Specifically it's three times more to fight there than in Iraq. It's probably because you have to fly everything in.""

He subsequently sent us a USA Today article from May 13 noting that in February, the Pentagon was spending $6.7 billion per month in Afghanistan compared with $5.5 billion in Iraq. ""As recently as fiscal year 2008, Iraq was three times as expensive; in 2009 it was twice as costly,"" according to the article.

The article also noted that the ""costs per service member in Afghanistan have been roughly double what they were in Iraq since 2005,"" because of its landlocked location, less-reliable security, high cost of fuel and its lack of infrastructure.

We found another source: a July 16, 2010 report on ""The Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Other Global War on Terror Operations Since 9/11"" from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm for Congress. It contained a breakdown of how much has been spent in Iraq and Afghanistan since Sept. 11, 2001, along with a monthly count of how many military personnel (described as ""boots on the ground"") in each country each month.

We took the September spending numbers for each year and each war and calculated the approximate cost per service member. Over the life of the Afghanistan war, the cost through September comes out to roughly $1.26 million per person. The average is $758,000 per person in Iraq.

So it has cost, on a per-service member basis, about two thirds more to fight in Afghanistan than in Iraq.

We rate Gardiner's statement False.",/factchecks/2010/sep/07/michael-j-gardiner/gardiner-says-war-costs-afghanistan-are-triple-any/

Strickland running mate Yvette McGee Brown says Ohio has fewest state employees since Reagan administration
","
For much of this gubernatorial campaign, Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland has been defending his record against charges from Republican challenger John Kasich that he has done too little to stem job losses in Ohio and responding to accusations that he still oversees a bloated state government.

Strickland’s running mate, Yvettee McGee Brown, in her own campaign speeches has echoed the governor’s. Recently she tackled a charge by Republicans that Ohio still has too many employees on the state payroll by evoking the name of one of the GOP’s favorite sons.

Ohio today has the ""fewest number of state employees since the Reagan administration,"" McGee Brown said in an Aug. 4 speech at a candidates forum in Columbus.

Clearly, recent well-chronicled state layoffs and hiring freezes almost assure Ohio has fewer state employees than when Strickland took office in 2007. But could it be fewer than in the 1980s when Reagan was president, as Brown contends?

The Strickland campaign is looking to reverse long-held Republican opinion that Democrats favor higher taxes and bigger government.

The higher taxes issue will loom for whomever is Ohio’s next governor, given that the state faces up to an $8 billion budget deficit in the next operating budget with seemingly few options other than raising personal income taxes.

But the big government question is something Strickland has dealt with since 2009 when the last biennial budget was set and the administration laid off state workers, froze hiring in some areas and otherwise shrunk government by attrition.

Now McGee Brown has gone a step further by stating that under Strickland, Ohio now has the fewest state employees since Reagan, who was president from 1981 through 1988.

Strickland’s campaign communications team offered uneven explanations for where McGee Brown got her information. It first stated it came from a state data chart that officials could not find until, PolitiFact began inquiring three weeks after McGee Brown’s speech. It then said the information was in an October 2009 news release from the Strickland administration that the campaign never produced.

But the Ohio Department of Administrative Services bailed them out. It discovered annual employee data in a trends report that contained information dating back to 1983 and updated to include recent years.

The report shows that as of December 2009, Ohio had 58,622 employees, the lowest number since 1983 when the state had 60,292 workers. That 28-year stretch includes a period from 1991 through 2006 when Ohio’s governors were Republicans and the state had more than 65,000 employees.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Republican Party of Texas']","

Republican Party says Democratic House leader, Jim Dunnam, has not lived in his district for years
","
When the chairman of the Texas House Democratic Caucus goes home, does he stay in the Waco-area district he represents?

That’s turf covered -- actually, re-plowed -- by the Republican Party of Texas in an Aug. 30 e-mail blast saying state Rep. Jim Dunnam ""has not lived in the district he represents for years now."" The party chairman, Steve Munisteri, had earlier levelled the same charge in a Waco press conference.

We wondered what was what, and where.

Some background: Article 3 of the Texas Constitution says House members must be Texas residents for two years and, before their election, must have lived for at least a year in the district they would represent. A similar one-year provision applies to Senate candidates, though they must have lived in Texas for five years; that hurdle has been in the news in connection with Republican Brian Birdwell’s eligibility to fill the Texas Senate seat he recently won in a special election. Birdwell has acknowledged voting for president in Virginia in 2004.

Dunnam’s legal residency has been challenged before. After the 2002 elections, Dunnam was sued by his defeated GOP foe, who said the legislator, his wife and children had lived since 1998 near McGregor (a Waco suburb) in a house no longer in the district Dunnam represents.

Dunnam’s house was cut out of his district when a state board redrew districts in 2001, according an Associated Press report from the time. The story quotes Dunnam saying he’d moved to a smaller house in his redrawn district (which he told us he later sold), but also kept the house near McGregor because he didn't want to uproot his kids from the Midway school district until absolutely necessary. The lawsuit was later dismissed by a judge.

This August, the Waco Tribune-Herald quoted Munisteri saying the party now plans no legal challenge to Dunnam’s legal residency. The chairman said ""residency cases are extremely difficult to win"" because the state’s standard for determining residency is based in part on a candidate’s intended residence. ""You can be absent from a location for a significant period of time and still be determined to be in the district legally,"" Munisteri said. But ""there’s a difference between legally being in the district and really in the district.""

The Tribune-Herald and the Dallas Morning News subsequently quoted Dunnam saying he owns the house outside his district so his children can attend Midway schools--plus a rural home he considers his homestead in nearby Falls County, which is in Dunnam’s district.

Dunnam told the Morning News that he votes in Chilton in Falls County where he and his wife built their house on 90 acres. Using Google Maps, we determined the Falls County home is about 20 miles south of Dunnam’s house near McGregor.

On a website titled ""Done With Dunnam,"" the GOP presents two from-the-road photos of the Falls County house, both taken July 31, according to a notation. The GOP’s caption: ""No activity in and out of house and no cars in the driveway.""

The Republican Party also presents two photographs taken from the street of Dunnam’s house near McGregor, one taken July 18 and the other July 31. In one photo, two of three cars are clearly visible; one has a ""state official"" license plate. The photos are captioned: ""Plenty of activity in and out of the house and cars bearing state official plates in the driveway.""

Dunnam, objecting to the criticism, told the Morning News: ""My constituents have no issue with me and my roots. I've been there 46 years and was literally born in the district -- and my dad was too, and my kids were.""

Separately, the Texas Tribune quoted Dunnam saying that since his homestead is in his district, Dunnam was confident he clears the constitution’s residency hurdle. Falls County confirmed that Dunnam claims the house as his homestead. According to the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, one can do so if the home is their ""principal residence"" on Jan. 1 of the tax year.

We also checked the Midway district’s residency requirement. Its website says that admission is free to students if they ""and either parent reside in the district."" Generally, district spokeswoman Traci Marlin told us, students must live within the school district with a parent who has legal custody or a legal guardian. Marlin said for the purposes of enrolling a student, the district doesn’t weigh whether their families take their homestead exemption on a house outside the district.

So, where does Dunnam actually live?

When we initially put that question to the legislator, Dunnam said, ""I’ll be in Houston tonight, I spent three nights in Austin last week ... I have a residence (the country place) and I spend time at various locations.""

Hmmm. Is it reasonable to conclude that Dunnam lives apart from his wife and children in his homestead residence in Falls County? Or -- since the Midway district requires at least one parent or guardian of a child to live in the district and Dunnam and his wife appear to be an intact couple -- does it make more sense to conclude the family stays mostly at the house near McGregor?

In a follow-up interview, Dunnam said he lives in the Falls County house, which he’d earlier said the couple completed about five years ago. ""I live in Chilton,"" Dunnam said. But ""I do spend time at my other house.""

Dunnam said too that both he and his wife are registered to vote in Falls County and have driver’s licenses with the Falls County address. And, he said, the Midway district has the Falls County address as his home address. We asked if he’d provide us access to that record--which would confirm he’s told the district he doesn’t live at the home near McGregor. Dunnam said he’d do so if we could assure him that would ""be dispositive"" -- ending our inquiry. We couldn’t guarantee that.

He added: ""It is unreasonable for you to assume anything about my personal life because you don’t know.""

True, and neither does the Republican Party. The party’s statement hinges on what is meant by where someone ""lives."" By a strict interpretation -- the one used by the GOP -- that would be where Dunnam stays most often. But determining that would take significant detective work, far more than a few photos.

A broader interpretation would allow for the possibility Dunnam hasn’t lived exclusively in his House district for years, but instead flits between -- and lives in -- both houses.

Our take: The party’s statement has an element of truth, but more than that isn’t proven; we rate the statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/06/republican-party-texas/republican-party-texas-says-democratic-house-leade/

John Loughlin, who is running in the Republican primary in the 1st Congressional District, is sounding a bipartisan theme in his call for cutting taxes as a solution to our economic problems. He tells viewers in his new web ad ""What we need to do is what John F. Kennedy did in 1961, which is cut taxes. What we need to do is what Ronald Reagan did in 1981, and cut taxes and enjoy exponential growth.""

Loughlin is echoing a popular Republican theme: If you want to grow the economy, cut taxes. The favorite example is Reagan, who was a big proponent of cutting taxes and reducing government spending. In his ad, Loughlin's unstated implication is that Reagan cut taxes and the economy grew explosively as a result.

But is it really that simple?

First, Reagan alone didn't cut taxes. He did it in conjunction with Congress. Having said that, let's look at the Reagan era of taxation.

There's no debate that Reagan dramatically reduced taxes in 1981, his first year in office. That $38-billion cut would equal $90 billion in today's dollars. At the time, it represented 1.91 percent of the gross domestic product, which is the total value of goods and services produced in the United States during a given year.

But the following year, Reagan raised taxes dramatically and other increases followed.

The 1982 hike alone, which applied to corporations and individuals, increased taxes by about $17 billion, according to a 2006 U.S. Treasury report. The increase represented 0.8 percent of the GDP. That's why it is sometimes billed as the largest peacetime tax increase in American history. That same year he also raised the gasoline tax.

In 1983, Reagan hiked taxes again. This time it was the passage of the Social Security Reform Act of 1983, which increased payroll taxes to provide long-term funding for Medicare and Social Security. According to liberal economist Paul Krugman, in a June 8, 2004, commentary in The New York Times, ""this tax increase more than undid any gains from Mr. Reagan's income tax cuts"" for many middle- and low-income families.

Reagan also significantly increased taxes through the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, the Tax Reform of 1986 and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987.

We asked Loughlin why he mentioned only Reagan's tax cut and not the subsequent increases. He said Reagan's 1984 increase, for example, ""was to combat a budget deficit and it was also because of a fear of inflation in 1984.""

""When I make the statement it was not to provide an economics lesson, but it was to illustrate that when tax rates are cut, specifically marginal tax rates and business tax rates, historically the economy experiences growth,"" he said. ""If you argue that that's what we need to do right now, grow the economy, then certainly that's a lesson from the past that has some relevance today.""

Wendy Schiller, a professor of political science and public policy at Brown University, said Reagan's tax policies and their impacts were complicated.

""He definitely raised taxes. He had to. But they were far more targeted taxes"" after the big 1981 cut, she said. ""When they talk about taxes, they also talk about the Medicare premium. They talk about the Social Security contribution and the income limit for Social Security contributions. All of those things would be considered taxes.""

Even when Reagan lowered the tax rate again in 1986, it didn't help the middle class, she said.

""In '81 they kept deductions for things like credit card interest and student loan interest, so if your parents paid your student loan they could take the deduction. In '86 they got rid of all that,"" said Schiller. ""So their overall tax load went up. He didn't yank up the tax rates by a third. He just took away a lot of the really good deductions for them, which ended up really raising the taxes [for] a lot of people who had benefited from the [1981] cuts.""

The other question is, did the original tax cut spark ""exponential growth,"" as Loughlin contended.

Taken literally, ""exponential"" refers to growth at an ever-increasing rate, as when something doubles, then triples, then quadruples. The economy during the Reagan years did no such thing.

When we talked to Loughlin about that part of his statement, he said: ""We experienced additional growth after Ronald Reagan cut taxes and that might be a bit of hyperbole to say 'exponentially.'""

In fact, immediately after the 1981 cuts, the country went into a recession. The GDP dropped by nearly 2 percent. The unemployment rate jumped more than two full percentage points, spiking to 9.7 percent.

Then things got better. The GDP rose 4.5 percent in 1983 and 7.2 percent in 1984. Those are substantial jumps. The increases returned to a fairly typical 3 percent and 4 percent during the rest of his tenure. Unemployment barely declined in 1983, but then began a steady fall to 5.3 percent in 1989, when Reagan left office.

In the end, it all boils down to a question of timing.

Conservatives argue that the economic downturn after Reagan's 1981 tax cut wasn't his fault. For example, the Heritage Foundation said the steep recession was caused by tightening the money supply and attempting to rein in the inflation.

Liberals argue that reversing the tax cuts restored confidence in the economy and spurred economic growth. Loughlin, like other conservatives, argue that the cuts themselves sparked the growth, and it simply took time for the benefits to appear.

We asked Edinaldo Tebaldi, an assistant professor of economics at Bryant University, about the timing. He said it takes one to three years ""to fully see the benefits of tax cuts.""

He said candidates may proclaim that if you cut taxes it will spark economic growth, but ""it's not that simple. The facts would not support that claim. Lower taxes are a good thing, but you need a good environment for business."" That can mean better regulations that work without being onerous. In addition, ""we need to cut how much the government spends on a regular basis.""

(Reagan had little success in his avowed quest to cut federal spending. Although Republicans controlled the Senate for the first six of his eight years, the Democrats held the House of Representatives.)

Schiller made similar points: ""Lots of things helped the economy. Fiscal policy, lowering interest rates, certainly the tax cuts, the rhetoric of fiscal restraint, and investing in defense spending will help the economy,"" she said. ""So there's a lot of things that went up and went down under Reagan.""

We'll let the economists and the partisan pundits wrangle over the impact and timing of tax changes and cycles of economic growth.

In the end, Loughlin is correct that Reagan cut taxes in 1981.

Yet he omits the important fact that the 40th president subsequently approved substantial increases, an omission we consider significant.

As for exponential growth after the Reagan tax cut, the candidate acknowledges that that's an exaggeration, although he shares the conviction of many others that the 1981 cut played a key role in economic growth in the 1980s.

In an economy as complex as ours, cause and effect statements like Loughlin's are great for a campaign ad, but they make the Truth-O-Meter shudder.

So we'll give the candidate a Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/05/john-loughlin/loughlin-says-reagans-1981-tax-cuts-led-exponentia/

Rep. Michael McCaul says CMS will disburse $803 billion, making it larger than all but 15 of the world's economies
","
Republicans balked at President Barack Obama's July decision to appoint the top federal administrator for Medicaid and Medicare without a congressional hearing, saying Congress deserved the chance to quiz the appointee, Donald Berwick, on how he intends to manage the federal behemoth called the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
Later that month, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, chimed in with a financial reason he wishes Berwick had undergone a public grilling: ""The CMS will disburse $803 billion in benefits this fiscal year, which makes it larger than all but 15 of the world’s economies."" The U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee, which publishes policy papers for GOP senators to consider, had said as much weeks earlier. McCaul serves on a similar panel advising House Republicans. 
We wondered whether McCaul's international comparison was on point. 
In its cost estimates for fiscal 2010, CMS notes that it distributes ""more benefits than any other federal agency"" — $803.1 billion in this fiscal year that runs through September. A CMS spokeswoman told us that figure still holds. 
Mike Rosen, a McCaul spokesman, pointed us to the International Monetary Fund, which publishes a report twice a year — most recently in April — analyzing global economic developments, including data on inflation, unemployment and countries' gross domestic product. 
The IMF estimated that this year, the United States has the largest GDP among 182 other countries, $14.79 trillion, followed by China ($5.36 trillion), Japan ($5.27 trillion) and Germany ($3.32 trillion). 
By that yardstick, Rosen said, CMS's annual spending would rank 16th among those countries, behind Korea's gross domestic product ($991 billion) and ahead of the Netherlands ($797 billion). 
Paul Van de Water, an analyst at Washington's liberal-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, agreed the CMS would rank 16th — the new health care law has little effect on Medicare and Medicaid spending this year — but said the billions in benefits merit some perspective. 
""The United States is a big country, and health care is much more expensive in the U.S. than anywhere else, so it's not surprising that health care for the elderly, disabled and poor costs a lot of money,"" Van de Water said. The United States has the world's third-largest population, according to the CIA World Factbook, behind China and India. ""U.S. government spending on national defense and homeland security will total about $750 billion this year; that number exceeds a lot of foreign GDPs, too, but the comparison provides no information about appropriate defense policy."" 
Van de Water said a more reasonable benchmark is the size of the U.S. economy. CMS ""estimates that total health care spending in the U.S., for all people and programs, in calendar year 2010 will equal 17.3 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product,"" he said. ""Of that amount, federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid is projected to equal 5.3 percent of GDP."" Defense spending: also about 5 percent. 
Thomas Saving, an economist and director of the Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas A&M University, agreed the GDP comparison would be more valuable. He noted that total health care expenditures in Japan, which has the world's the third-largest GDP, are about 9 percent of its GDP — or about half the U.S. ratio. 
Saving said McCaul's ""comparison has no useful information,"" pointing out that the population of the smaller economies are tiny when compared to the populations in countries with the largest GDPs — or states, for that matter. ""Another not useful fact is that (national) CMS benefits are smaller than the Texas state GDP,"" he added. 
""Social Security benefits are 4.8 percent of the U.S. GDP — also larger than most of the world's economies,"" Saving said. ""We are a big country in population and a rich country in per-capita GDP. 
Offering a less critical take, Brian Blase, a health policy analyst from the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation, said McCaul's comparison illustrates a bigger point: ""The U.S. spends an awful lot on health care, primarily on Medicaid and Medicare. We spend more (total) on health care for seniors and poor people than most of the other countries could spend if they spent all their income."" 
However, Blase agreed McCaul's claim is ""somewhat misleading"" and said ""if you really want to do a comparison, you want to put it in per capita terms."" How come? Gross numbers can be misleading without context. For instance, China recently passed Japan as the country with the second highest GDP, but it's ""nowhere close to as wealthy as Japan right now because Japan's population is a fraction of the population of China,"" he said. 
Rosen of McCaul's office stood by the congressman's statement in an e-mail: ""We were not comparing our health care expenditures to that of other countries... The numbers are the numbers. 16th is 16th."" 
Our take? True, the CMS is poised to spend some $800 billion this year, more money than the size of all but 15 nations' economies. But this dramatic point isn't a meaningful comparison, because it lacks any context — such as spending per person — that puts the numbers in perspective. 
We rate McCaul's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/04/michael-mccaul/rep-michael-mccaul-says-cms-will-disburse-803-bill/

Sen. Barbara Boxer says Condoleezza Rice didn't know how many troops had died in Iraq
","During a meeting with the San Francisco Chronicle's editorial board on Aug. 31, 2010, Sen. Barbara Boxer was asked about a controversial comment she made in 2007 to then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice about Rice not paying a ""personal price"" in the Iraq War because she did not have any immediate family members serving in the military.

Rice and a number of political pundits later claimed Boxer's comment was an unfair jab because Rice didn't have children.

In the editorial board meeting, Boxer, a California Democrat, sought to set the record straight about her comments, but then added a bit of revisionist history, saying she was criticizing Rice because she didn't know how many American troops had died in Iraq. In fact, Rice never said that.

Let's back up to 2007.

During the Jan. 11, 2007, Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Boxer tried to make a point with Rice about the sacrifice families were making in the Iraq War. ""The issue is, 'Who pays the price?' I'm not going to pay a personal price. My kids are too old. My grandchild is too young. You're not going to pay the price, as I understand it, with immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families,"" Boxer said.

A day later, Rice told the New York Times that she believed Boxer was implying she was less sensitive about the impact of war because Rice didn't have kids. ''I thought it was O.K. to be single. I thought it was O.K. to not have children, and I thought you could still make good decisions on behalf of the country if you were single and didn't have children.''

Fast-forward three years to the editorial board meeting and Boxer said her words were twisted.

""I asked her how many people had died and she did not know the answer to that question. And since we had lost a lot of Californians, I was concerned. And I said, you and I don't have, we haven't paid a person price. I said, you and I, I said, myself, my grand kids are too young, my husband too old, and as far as I know you don't have anybody in the war. So I tried to use it to bring us together, but the right-wing press said that I questioned, that I turned on her because she wasn't married which was a little silly.""

So you weren't criticizing? Boxer was asked.

""I was criticizing the fact that she didn't know how many people died in Iraq. Absolutely I was,"" Boxer said.

But in a blog posting after the editorial board meeting, the Chronicle's Debra J. Saunders called Boxer out, pointing out that in the 2007 hearing, Boxer never actually asked Rice how many Americans had died in the war in Iraq.

""I can see why Boxer would want to believe that she put her foot in her mouth -- and somehow it was Rice's fault, but the tale turns out to be a figment of Barbara Boxer's self-aggrandizing imagination,"" Saunders wrote.

We reviewed the video ourselves, and Saunders is correct -- Boxer actually hadn't asked Rice any questions prior to her ""personal price"" comments. Nor did such a question arise at any point in the exchange between the two. In other words, Rice wasn't ignorant of the number of troop casualties; she was never asked.

Indeed, it wasn't until after her ""personal price"" comments, when Boxer asked Rice about casualties, but it was for an estimate of future deaths from the surge in troops:

Boxer: ""Do you have have an estimate of the number of casualties we expect from this surge?""

Rice: ""No Senator, I don't think there's any way to give you such an estimate.""

Boxer: ""Has the president, because he said, 'Expect more sacrifice.' He must know.""

Rice: ""Senator, I don't think any of us have a number of expected casualties. I think that people understand that there is going to be violence for some time in Iraq and that there will be more casualties.""

And then Rice responded to Boxer's ""personal price"" comments.

""And let me just say, I fully understand the sacrifice that the American people are making,"" Rice said. ""And especially the sacrifice that our soldiers are making, men and women in uniform. I visit them. I know what they're going through. I talk to their families. I see it. I could never, and I can never, do anything to replace any of those lost men and women in uniform, or the diplomats…""

Said Boxer: ""Madam Secretary, please, I know you feel terrible about it. That's not the point. I was making the case as to who pays the price for your decisions, and the fact that this administration would move forward with this escalation with no clue as to the further price that we are going to pay militarily. We certainly know the numbers, billions of dollars that we can't spend here in this country. I find really appalling that not even enough time was taken to figure out what the casualties would be.""

""Senator, I think it would be highly unlikely for the military to tell the president we expect 'X' number of casualties because of this augmentation of the forces,"" Rice said.

So there you have it. Boxer asked Rice for a projection on how many American troop casualties might be lost in the surge, and Rice essentially answered that that was unknowable.

In the editorial board meeting, Boxer made a strong argument for her initial point that she was not criticizing Rice for being single and childless. As Boxer noted, and the record confirmed, Boxer began by noting that she, herself, did not have any immediate family serving in Iraq; and she then made the point that neither did Rice.

But in defending herself on that issue, Boxer completely distorted what Rice said. She claimed Rice did not know how many American soldiers ""had died"" -- past tense. In fact, Rice said she could not project expected casualties from the surge. Boxer makes it sound like Rice either didn't know or didn't care about the number of soldiers who had died and that Boxer was nobly calling her out. In fact, she was asking Rice to speculate about casualties in the future. We find the senator's revisionist account to be far from the truth and disparaging of Rice.

Meet the outsiders: Rick Scott and Jennifer Carroll
","
Trying to keep the outsider label that propelled him to victory in the Republican primary for governor, millionaire businessman Rick Scott said on Sept. 2, 2010, that he's picked a fellow outsider for lieutenant governor in Jennifer Carroll.

""We have similar backgrounds,"" Scott said in a press conference in Brandon to announce Carroll's selection. ""She's smart, she wants to work hard. She's got experience in the Legislature. She's an outsider like I am.""

Carroll, who was considered as a potential running mate for Charlie Crist in 2006, has an interesting story. Let's see if it adds up to being an outsider.

Carroll, 51, was born in Port of Spain, in Trinidad, but was brought to the United States by her family at a young age.

She joined the U.S. Navy and rose from jet mechanic to become the top aide to an admiral. In 1999, she retired from the Navy as a lieutenant commander and started a public relations firm, 3N. & J.C. Corp. She moved to northeast Florida in 1986.

We've already ruled that Carroll would be the second woman and first African-American woman elected lieutenant governor. That certainly puts her outside the norms of politics, as does her being born in Trinidad.

But Carroll's life after the Navy seems pretty political insider to us.

Consider: 
Carroll's official state House biography also includes the following highlights -- Republican Club of Clay County, ""Top 10"" Republican Award 1999, 2002; appointed by President George W. Bush to the White House Presidential Scholars Commission, 2001-2004; appointed by President George W. Bush to the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission, 2004-2007; Black Political Action Committee's 2005 Vikki Buckley Political Leadership Award.

Carroll's life story certainly has some of the hallmarks of being a political outsider. She was born outside the United States and spent 20 years working in the Navy. But after retiring from the Navy in 1999, Carroll has very much made politics a key part of her life. She twice ran for Congress, said she was in talks for a job with Vice President Cheney, ran the state's Department of Veterans Affairs, was elected to the Florida House and was considered for Crist's lieutenant governor choice in 2006. So Carroll has some outsider, and some insider. We rate Scott's statement Half True.

Jennifer Carroll could make history if elected lieutenant governor
","
Conservative outsider Rick Scott says he's making history with his pick for lieutenant governor.

Scott's pick, Jacksonville-area state Rep. Jennifer Carroll, ""is the first African-American Republican woman to be part of a statewide ticket in Florida,""  the Scott campaign said in a Sept. 2, 2010, news release.

Carroll was born in Trinidad and moved to Florida in 1986, according to her state House website. Scott called her the ""embodiment of the American Dream.""

But is she the first black Republican woman on a statewide ticket?

In short, yes.

The lieutenant governor's position has existed two separate times in state history. The first came from 1865-1889, the Reconstruction period following the Civil War, but the position was elected independent of the governor. In those years, the lieutenant governor served as ex-officio president of the Senate and cast tie-breaking votes. The lieutenant governor also was next in the line of succession to be governor.

The post was abandoned from 1889-1968, before being revived. Since then, candidates for governor select a prospective lieutenant governor. The two then run together as joint candidates, or a ticket.

That makes this year's two major tickets -- Scott and Carroll for Republicans, and Alex Sink and Rod Smith for Democrats -- just the 11th set in state history. The first modern-day lieutenant governor, Ray C. Osborne, was appointed by then-Gov. Claude Kirk following an amendment to the state Constitution. 
Carroll is the third Republican woman to be selected as the GOP candidate for lieutenant governor, but the first black woman. 
In 1978, former U.S. Sen. Paula Hawkins was a candidate for lieutenant governor on a ticket with Jack Eckerd. The two lost to Bob Graham and Wayne Mixson.

Then in 2003, Toni Jennings became the first woman lieutenant governor. She was nominated by Gov. Jeb Bush to replace Frank Brogan. (Bush picked Sandra Mortham as a running mate in late 1997, but she withdrew after only two months when questions were raised about her office practices and spending as secretary of state.)

We also should note that Carroll is the first black woman to be a major party nominee for lieutenant governor. Claude Kirk, the quixotic former Republican governor, attempted a comeback as a Democrat in 1978 and ran with state Rep. Mary Singleton, the first black woman elected to the Jacksonville City Council. The two lost in the primary.

And she's the third major party black candidate for lieutenant governor. David Montgomery, a Republican, was the first during Reconstruction in 1876. The second was Darryl Jones, who was Democrat Jim Davis' running mate in 2006. 
We noticed that the Scott campaign used ""African-American"" to describe Carroll though she was born in Trinidad in the Caribbean. Carroll on her website describes herself as black, but she also is chair of the Republican Party of Florida African-American Leadership Council. 
We really don't want to get into a race debate about what constitutes African-American. Suffice to say she is the first black woman to be on the GOP ticket. 
In announcing his pick for lieutenant governor, Scott said Carroll ""is the first African-American Republican woman to be part of a statewide ticket in Florida.""

Russ Feingold says Ron Johnson ""is willing to hand over the Great Lakes to the oil companies""
","
As in the Gulf of Mexico, oil just won’t disappear from the U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin.

It’s a central part of an ad by U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat locked in a tough re-election battle. Not only does the ad argue that Republican Ron Johnson wants to drill for oil in the Great Lakes, it says he’s ""willing to hand over the Great Lakes to the oil companies.""

For lake-loving Wisconsinites, the issue hits home.

The charge goes back to a statement that bubbled up when Johnson sat down for a wide-ranging interview with Wispolitics.com. Johnson, an Oshkosh businessman, was asked this question:

""Would you support more drilling in the U.S., continental, Great Lakes for example, if there was oil found there, and more exploration in Alaska, those kind of things?""

Johnson’s answer: ""The bottom line is, we are an oil based economy and there’s nothing we’re going to do to get off of that for many, many years. So we have to be realistic and recognize that fact. We have to get the oil where it is, but we need to do it responsibly, we need to utilize American ingenuity and American technology to make sure we to do it environmentally sensitively and safely.""

That’s where it began.

This is where it wound up:

The Feingold campaign issued a news release June 18 that said, ""when asked if he would support drilling in the Great Lakes, Johnson said: ‘I think we have to get the oil where it is.’ "" The release prompted some chatter in the blogosphere, though the issue remained low on the public radar screen.

And the Johnson campaign remained silent.

Then came Feingold’s TV ad. It showed a map of the United States and graphically transplanted the BP oil spill from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Michigan shores. Meanwhile, Feingold is heard saying Johnson is ""willing to hand over the Great Lakes to the oil companies, threatening Wisconsin’s economy and a way of life for generations of Wisconsin families.""

To hear Feingold, one would think BP was ready to plop an oil rig just off the Summerfest grounds. So, we figured it was time for us to do a little drilling of our own to see if Feingold  hit the mark.

There is little doubt Johnson, a BP shareholder, has a ""Drill, baby, drill"" attitude. On Oct. 10, 2009 -- before he was a candidate -- Johnson told a tea party gathering in Oshkosh: ""I want oil companies to make enough money to continue to explore, drill, refine, and deliver gas to virtually every corner of America.""

That would presumably include the Great Lakes.

But Johnson’s campaign issued a statement July 12, four weeks after the Wispolitics.com interview, that left no wiggle room. It said: ""I would reject any and all efforts to drill in the Great Lakes.""

That statement was issued at 3:49 p.m., the day before the Feingold ad was launched. John Kraus, senior strategist for Feingold’s campaign, said the Johnson statement was issued about an hour after the Feingold campaign made its TV buy.

Coincidence, or was Johnson tipped off about the Feingold ad? You decide.

Johnson quickly launched his own response ad, which said in part: ""Ron Johnson opposes drilling in the Great Lakes and Russ Feingold knows it."" And Johnson and his campaign later argued there’s not enough oil in the lake to make drilling worthwhile and that it was too cold to do much drilling here anyway. Finally, six weeks after his initial response Johnson said he may have not heard ""Great Lakes"" included in the question.

In other words, it’s kind of a gooey mess.

Let’s clean it all up.

Feingold took an off-the-cuff statement by Johnson -- albeit one Johnson had a month to correct -- and made it the centerpiece of a TV ad that launched the day after Johnson had re-framed his views.   

Johnson has noted his support for more oil exploration. But the ad made a flat hand-the-lakes-over statement, ignoring Johnson’s expressed concerns for the environment. That’s not handing the lakes over to Big Oil. It was produced based on the original Johnson statement, but the ad remained on the air long after Johnson clearly said no to Great Lakes drilling. And Feingold is continuing to state on the campaign trail: ""It’s kind of reasonable to think that if (Johnson) had a chance to vote for drilling the Great Lakes, he’d be first in line.""

Ron Johnson says gas taxes exceed oil company profits
","
The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was still an accident waiting to happen when Ron Johnson rose to address a political rally last fall, months before he formally entered the U.S. Senate race as a Republican.

But the spill would make oil a key issue in many Senate races, including in Johnson’s bid for the seat held by Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold. And oil company profits have long been a debating point between the parties.

In his speech, Johnson spoke in defense of oil industry profits and against candidates who criticize the big oil companies. He said the industry’s success fuels further exploration -- and its stock helps fund the retirement accounts of millions of Americans.

""How many times have you heard a politician attack Big Oil and Big Pharma as if these were some kind of evil enterprises preying on our society?"" Johnson said at the rally. ""Why do they do this?  Well, I guess it sounds good to some people, and might help them get elected in some districts. But I can guarantee you, it does nothing to help our country.

""I don’t know about you, but I want businesses to succeed ... I want oil companies to make enough money to continue to explore, drill, refine and deliver gas to virtually every corner of America.

""Almost everyone's 401(k) or retirement fund owns stock in these companies.  And I hope everyone realizes that both the state and federal governments make more per gallon in gas taxes than the oil companies make themselves for doing all the work.""

So is Johnson on the money regarding the government’s take of gasoline sales?

His campaign offers evidence from the American Petroleum Institute, the national trade group representing oil and gas companies. An institute report released in August suggests that, per dollar of sales, gas taxes are more than double the net income earned by the largest oil companies.

But Stephen Comstock, API’s manager of tax policy, steered PolitiFact Wisconsin away from the institute’s own per-gallon breakdown. He said it could be confusing and might not be appropriate for assessing the notion that gas taxes exceed profits.

Comstock suggested the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a federal agency that compiles tax and revenue data about the biggest oil companies.

Their numbers aren’t a perfect fit for the Johnson claim, in part because they include profits from products other than gasoline. But government and private researchers say they are the best available.

We found that Johnson’s equation holds up in some years but is off base in others. The reason: Industry profits fluctuate wildly with the price of crude oil. We examined U.S. profits as well as the total net profits including foreign sales.

Here’s the scorecard: 
In individual years, the range can be wide. In down years, gas taxes paid by the industry -- and passed along to drivers at the pump -- can exceed even combined US-foreign profits by 100 percent (1999). In boom times, U.S. profits alone can top gas taxes paid by almost 40 percent (2006).

A 2010 study by the Tax Foundation, a conservative research organization, went back even further. It found that excise taxes collected from the industry outstripped combined foreign and domestic profits in 12 of the 28 years reviewed.

So let’s take stock.

Johnson’s timing was good: When he gave his speech, taxes the year before came in higher than U.S. profits by the big companies. That 2008 comparison is the latest available on the federal website. But he didn’t put a time frame on his statement, stating the equation as a timeless fact. And if you include foreign profits, it’s not on target even for 2008.

Scott Walker blames Tom Barrett for dumping sewage into Lake Michigan
","
Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker is raising a stink over sewage. It’s a tempting target, especially when torrential rains July 22 and July 23 forced the dumping of untreated sewage into Lake Michigan and thousands of homes were hit with flooded basements.

Walker, a Republican candidate for governor, is blaming his opponent, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, for dumping the sewage -- not only for the July overflows, but for releases going back to 2004, when Barrett was first elected.

On at least two occasions, Walker campaign manager Keith Gilkes blamed Barrett for the recent mess and previous overflows. On Aug. 5, Gilkes made the charge during a visit to the city by Lisa Jackson, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. On Aug. 11, he made the same charge after local communities complained about a large water rate increase being proposed by Barrett’s Milwaukee Water Works.

With summer winding down, it’s a topic fresh in many people’s minds: torrents of water running through streets, the giant sinkhole on E. North Ave. that swallowed a Cadillac Escalade and the mounds of water-soaked junk carted from homes in the aftermath.  Five to eight inches of rain fell July 22 and July 23, according to the National Weather Service. Officially, 5.61 inches fell at Mitchell International Airport, the second highest daily rainfall on record for Milwaukee.

With so much rain, Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District reported it couldn’t treat 2.1 billion gallons of sewage and storm water, which ended up going in  the lake.

MMSD has done that every year, to varying degrees depending on the weather: When the deep tunnels run out of room and the sewage treatment plants on Jones Island and South Shore can’t keep up, the district shuts off access to the tunnels and sends untreated sewage into the lake. The overflows present environmental problems for the lake, but without them, sewage is more apt to back up into people’s basements. By law, the district is required to report the releases to the state Department of Natural Resources.

Going back to when Barrett was first elected mayor, and highlighting a campaign promise made in 2004, the Walker campaign said the sewage dumps are Barrett’s fault. ""Since being elected, he has dumped 8.2 billion gallons of raw sewage into Lake Michigan,"" Gilkes said.

That’s a lot of flushing, so we decided to look into the claims.  

First the number. The Walker organization used media reports from the overflows going back to 2004 and tallied up what went untreated.

We found Walker low-balled it. Had his campaign staff checked with MMSD - the totals are on the district’s website -- his people would have found that overflows actually totaled 10.4 billion gallons since 2004. Walker undershot the mark by 21percent.

Walker spokeswoman Jill Bader said her staff assumed news reports, including figures from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stories, were comprehensive. But by using different news accounts from different sources to tally up the figures, their number was off. For instance, in 2007, the Walker campaign didn’t use news reports from the Journal Sentinel at all, and in so doing missed nearly 400 million gallons of overflows. After being contacted by PolitiFact Wisconsin, she said the campaign staff had recently come across the district’s higher figures.

Now, the discharges themselves.

Is it raw sewage? That term sounds like it’s all coming from toilets.  Actually, an estimated 95 percent is rainwater and runoff. Still, it’s untreated and therefore can be considered ""raw.""

Finally, what about Barrett’s role in all of this?

In a literal sense, he doesn’t have a hand in it. The city doesn’t operate Jones Island or the South Shore plant. The July decision to shut the gates to the deep tunnel system and start overflows was made by Kevin Shafer, MMSD’s executive director, in concert with his staff and Veolia Water North America, which operates the district’s waste water treatment system.

Shafer said he made his first decision at about 6 p.m. on July 22 for the combined sewer system covering portions of Milwaukee and Shorewood and again at 1 a.m. the next day for the separated sewer system. It’s the same procedure for all overflows.

""There is no contact with elected officials,"" Shafer said. ""It’s purely an operational/technical decision that I make.""

But Barrett bears some responsibility.

During his first campaign for mayor in 2004, Barrett was highly critical of MMSD and he vowed to fix the problem by demanding that the agency stop dumping raw sewage. ""The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District must clean up its act,"" Barrett said during the campaign. A Barrett radio ad lamented that MMSD the previous summer had ""dumped 90,000 gallons of raw sewage into Lincoln Creek,"" which ultimately flows into the lake, and cited this as an example of the ""outrageous failures of the district.""

As mayor, Barrett controls seven out of the 11 members of the MMSD board. He has the ability through his appointments to influence policy and procedures.

The district plans to spend $1 billion by the end of the year to create new capacity and make other improvements to reduce overflows under a 2002 court-approved agreement between the DNR and MMSD. The new 27th Street tunnel project added 27 million gallons of capacity. A 7.1 mile long tunnel on the northwest side added 89 millions gallons of capacity.

The entire storage system can store 521 million gallons until MMSD can process it.

That means to handle the 2.1 billion gallons of overflow from the July storm, MMSD would need a system that is about four times larger. On the 27th Street tunnel project, the district said it spent $3 for every gallon of capacity. So if that cost held true, the price tag for an expansion able to handle 2.1 billion gallons would be about $6 billion.

James Fratrick, a watershed specialist for the  DNR, said that MMSD will never completely stop untreated waste from being released into Lake Michigan, and its state permit allows some emergency dumping to occur because zero discharge is not practical or required under federal law.

""With rainfall events like this, it’s not economically feasible,"" Fratrick said.

So there is some truth to Walker’s statement in that Barrett pledged he would stop the flows during the campaign and can influence the policies and procedures through his appointments to the board. But it’s an exaggeration to say that Barrett himself dumped the raw sewage into the lake after the extraordinary rainfall.

"['Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says Tom Barrett ""has held the line on property taxes""
","
President Barack Obama, in Milwaukee on Aug. 16 to attend a fund-raising luncheon for Tom Barrett’s gubernatorial campaign, praised the Milwaukee mayor for intervening in a domestic dispute outside of State Fair Park last year - and cast his fellow Democrat as something of a hero to taxpayers, saying in his remarks:

""Under his watch, this city has held the line on property taxes, it’s expanded opportunity, it’s put more cops on the street and reduced crime as a result.""

The part about property taxes caught our attention. Barrett isn’t widely regarded as a tax hawk -- at least not in comparison with Scott Walker and Mark Neumann, the Republican candidates for governor.

""Held the line,"" of course, may mean one thing in the eye of the holder and another in the eye of the beholder, so let’s take a look.

We’ll start with a definition.

To hold the line, according to Merriam-Webster’s definition, is to ""maintain the current position or situation.""

So, if you don’t increase property taxes at all, that certainly fits. Or if an increase is within inflation -- and does not come with any hidden costs -- that may fill the bill as well.

When we asked the White House to elaborate on Obama’s ""held the line"" comment, a spokesman referred us to the Democratic National Committee. The DNC e-mailed PolitiFact Wisconsin a statement that made four points.

One point spoke of why Barrett raised the levy -- the total amount of property taxes collected -- and another told how he has worked to cut pension costs. Neither of these points addresses how much property taxes have risen under Barrett.

The DNC’s other two assertions were more on point - but not very persuasive:

First, in Barrett’s six years in office, the DNC said, property taxes have risen less than inflation in three of those years.

Even that part of the DNC statement was confusing and included an error. It used ""taxes"" and ""tax rates"" interchangeably, when DNC spokesman Derrick Plummer later told PolitiFact Wisconsin it should have said ""tax levy."" Additionally, Plummer said the increase was below inflation in two years and near inflation in a third.

So, the levy increase was higher than inflation in four of six years.

Second, Barrett’s proposed levies, the DNC said,  were higher than the levies ultimately adopted by the Common Council in four of the six years -- but less than 1 percent higher.

That sounds like the council, not the mayor, was more closely watching the bottom line. Moreover, highlighting the difference between the executive and legislative branches says nothing about how high taxes actually went up.

Beyond that, revenue collected from fees has more than doubled under Barrett. That means property owners are paying higher fees -- for services that used to be covered by property taxes -- as well as higher property taxes.

The newest fee -- for storm water management -- was created under Barrett; he proposed it and the Common Council approved it in 2006. When you add revenue from the storm water fee to revenue from the three other major fees -- for solid waste disposal, snow and ice removal, and sewer -- the fee collection total is projected to hit $89.6 million in 2010 -- more than double the $40.1 million that was collected when Barrett took office in 2004.

Shifting the cost of a city service from the property tax to a fee does spread that cost among more payers; for example, nonprofit organizations that don’t pay property taxes do pay fees. But, the bottom line is that the city is now collecting nearly $50 million per year more in fees under Barrett for services that used to be provided through the property tax levy.

So, let’s re-focus strictly on property taxes.

We’ll use 2004 as the base line. That was the year Barrett was elected mayor and the year that the tax levy was approved for his first budget, in 2005.

Starting with the levy for 2004 of $199,012,386, the levy increased 2 percent for 2005; 4.96 percent for 2006; 3.3 percent for 2007; 3.25 percent for 2008; 4.29 percent for 2009; and 4.12 percent for 2010, when the levy is to hit $246,754,533.

The six annual increases total 21.92 percent, which means levy increases under Barrett have averaged 3.65 percent per year.

The figure led Dale Knapp, research director of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a research organization in Madison, to disagree with Obama’s characterization of Barrett’s record on property taxes.

""I’m not sure if I would call that holding the line on taxes,"" Knapp said. ""They’re (the levies) not growing outlandishly, but then again, they’re not flat or growing at a couple percent either. They seem to be generally very average.""

Surprisingly, perhaps, Michael Birkley, an advocate for lower property taxes, agreed with Obama’s take on Barrett.

Birkley is legislative director of Madison-based Wisconsin Property Taxpayers, a group not as well known as the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. WPT says it works ""to reduce the statewide property tax burden and reform Wisconsin’s antiquated and regressive property tax system.""

""Held the line? You bet he did,"" Birkley said of Barrett.

In his estimation, that means not holding growth below inflation, but using a combination of inflation and an allowance for new construction growth in the city. That was the formula set out under Gov. Jim Doyle and the Legislature in the years the state put a cap on property tax growth.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the CPI-U -- the consumer price index for urban consumers. Its figures for the Milwaukee-Racine area show an average increase of 2.48 percent per year from 2004 to through the first half of 2010. Meanwhile, figures from the City of Milwaukee assessor’s office show growth from new construction averaged 1.91 percent per year from 2004 through 2010.

Together, the two figures tally an average growth of 4.39 percent. That’s more than the 3.65 percent average increase in the property taxes collected.

In his assessment, Birkley said he is not including the shift to fees:

""Our concern is the property tax,"" he said.

That’s fine. But to the average resident, it’s money from a different pocket. Had the revenue from fees remained on the levy, property taxes would have risen an average of 5.87 percent per year during Barrett’s six years, well above the 4.39 percent increase in inflation plus new growth.

So, how does all of this shake out?

Property taxes may not have not shot up under Barrett; the increases in levies have been kept below inflation plus new growth in the city. But in some years the city was limited by state-imposed caps on how much property taxes could be increased. And, in some years, the property tax levy  was lower than the mayor proposed once the Common Council finished its work.  

President Obama’s statement ignores the shift of items from the property tax to fees, with total revenue collected from the four main fees more than doubling under Barrett. So city property owners are hit with that increase, on top of the higher property taxes.

"['Georgia', 'Gambling', 'Nathan Deal']","
Deal makes controversial statements about casino gambling
","
GOP gubernatorial candidate Nathan Deal's recent statements on gambling made some conservatives cringe.

During a forum on tourism in Savannah, Deal said the state should keep an ""open mind"" about casino gambling and other types of gaming.

Conservative Christian groups objected, and seven days later, Deal told a television reporter that he didn't ""favor it on a personal basis. I just don’t think you can gamble yourself out of a bad economy.""

News stories said Deal had a ""change of heart"" or was ""not as open-minded"" on the issue as he was before.

Did Deal flip-flop?

The AJC's PolitiFact Georgia took a closer look at Deal's statements and his record as a former U.S. congressman.

Gambling wasn't an issue during the primary elections, but it is important among the social conservatives who helped Deal win a squeaker against Republican runoff opponent and former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel.

Members of the Georgia Christian Coalition and the Georgia Baptist Convention did not ask Deal for his position on gambling, their officials told the AJC's PolitiFact Georgia.

Neither group endorses candidates, but if Deal did say he was open to looking into gambling, ""it would have made a difference in the runoff,"" said Jerry Luquire, president of the Georgia Christian Coalition.

Deal made his statement on gambling Aug. 18 during a Savannah Area Tourism Leadership Council forum on tourism. It was in response to a question by WTOC-TV anchor Sonny Dixon, who interviewed Deal and opponent Democrat Roy Barnes separately.

""How do you feel about gaming, whether it was horse racing, casinos, whatever, in Georgia?"" Dixon asked. ""And if you‘re in favor of it, what do you think will be the process, how do you feel the process would go generally?""

""Well, I certainly think that we ought to be open to discussions like that,"" Deal replied. ""I do know there have been both successes and monstrous failures in terms of gaming in other states. I don’t think we should go into it with our eyes blinded. We ought to understand all of the ramifications of it to do it -- the bad, the social, and the costs associated with it that are sometimes not discussed in the general, opening debates about those things.""

After a brief aside about a horse he once owned, Deal added: ""But I get there are potentials. We should look at it with an open mind. And we should not say 'no' just because of any particular bias one way or the other. I’m willing to keep an open mind with that and let's take a look at all the facts before we make a decision.""

Deal stopped short of endorsing casinos, but did say there are benefits to them and he supports looking into them in detail.

Gambling foe Ray Newman, a lobbyist for the state Baptist Convention, was so concerned by Deal's statement that he called the candidate. He declined to give details of their conversation, saying it was private.

But Newman did say this of Deal and casinos:

""I don't know what his position is,"" Newman said.

After the flap, Deal talked with WSB-TV reporter Lori Geary. Deal's spokesman talked with The Associated Press.

Deal told Geary: ""Well, I don’t favor it on a personal basis. I just don’t think you can gamble yourself out of a bad economy,"" and ""What I was saying was that I would keep an open mind to suggestions of legislators.""

Later, Deal spokesman Brian Robinson told The Associated Press: ""He [Deal] personally opposes casino gambling,"" and ""Nathan does not believe gambling is the best way to create jobs.""

Deal's nearly two-decade record as a congressman shed little light on his views. While we did find votes against Internet gambling, we found no record he voted on casinos or other types of gaming. That's not surprising. The decision to allow casinos is made at the state level.

We went to Robinson to clarify the issue. He repeated what Deal told WSB-TV and the AP, emphasizing that the issue was moot because gambling is against the state constitution. Expanding it would require a constitutional amendment, which cannot be vetoed by the governor.

But governors do have significant sway. A governor, after all, has the state's bully pulpit and all the clout that goes with it.

Legislators have to approve a proposed amendment by a two-thirds vote to get it on the ballot. They also have to pass a bill enacting it. A governor's opinion on a proposal can make or break it, said Steve Anthony, who has worked at the state Capitol and is a lecturer at Georgia State University.

For instance, Gov. Zell Miller campaigned for a lottery to fund education initiatives such as the HOPE scholarship for college-bound students with good grades. As a result, the Georgia Lottery was founded in 1992.

Also, the governor appoints the Georgia Lottery Board. Nearly two years ago, it was approached with a plan for opening a casino with video lottery terminals in Underground Atlanta. The board never voted on the issue, and the plan died.

Robinson said Deal would appoint board members who will assure the HOPE scholarship's financial strength ""without an expansion of gambling.""

So where does this leave us?

Much of Deal's position on gambling is unclear. What, if anything, would it take to get him to endorse it? Would he commission a study on its economic impact? And what kinds of action might he take if Georgians decided to push for it?

Like Baptist Convention lobbyist Newman, we don't know.

But since the controversy, Deal has shifted what he says publicly about gambling. He's no longer using the phrase ""open mind."" He has not mentioned studying the pros and cons of gambling, either.

Furthermore, Deal said he would support Lottery Board members who will support ensuring the financial stability of the HOPE scholarship without expanding gambling.

In other words, Deal was saying one thing before the controversy. Now he's saying another. We give Deal a Half Flip.",/factchecks/2010/sep/03/nathan-deal/deal-makes-controversial-statements-about-casino-g/

Republican Dave Yost attacks Democratic David Pepper on taxes and public safety in race for Ohio auditor
","
The auditor’s role in state government is obscure to many voters, so the Republican candidate in this year’s race has attacked his opponent on taxes, a much more familiar issue.

In a recent online video, Republican Dave Yost lists a handful of tax increases Democrat David Pepper supported as a commissioner in Cincinnati’s Hamilton County. As the taxes are recounted, the video’s narrator issues a brief warning to voters about Pepper’s solution after voters rejected a tax hike he pushed.

""When Pepper's tax was finally voted down, Pepper laid off cops, and closed jails and let criminals run free in the streets,"" the video’s narrator said.

We found facts to back up Yost’s statement, but the underlying message that Pepper negligently endangered the public is misleading.

Pepper is judged here on two votes he made as one of three Hamilton County commissioners: One in favor of a tax hike and another in approval of the county’s 2009 budget.

Pepper and another commissioner, without a vote of the people, raised the sales tax in 2007 to pay for a ""comprehensive safety plan,"" which called for a new jail and holding steady the number of deputies patrolling the streets. The third commissioner voted against the tax hike. Voters later followed suit, rejecting the tax increase when petitioners forced it on the ballot.

Yost’s video makes no mention that ""Pepper’s tax"" was an attempt to boost public safety.

Hamilton County, without any money for a new jail, continued to pay rent at other correctional facilities. The economy worsened over the next year, and commissioners realized they would have to slash budgets in 2009. The sheriff’s budget was slashed 16 percent, from 74.8 million to 62.8 million.

The cut forced 165 layoffs, including 24 patrol officers, closed the Queensgate Correctional Facility and resulted in more prisoners getting released before their sentence ended. All of these consequences were laid out before Pepper and the other commissioners unanimously approved the budget.

Hamilton County Sheriff Simon Leis, a Republican who’s held the job for more than 20 years, had the final say on how to spend his budget. He said there was no choice but to close the jail and lay off workers. He would not blame Pepper because he tried to pay for a new jail and keep police on the street by temporarily raising the sales tax. Voters also rejected a tax levy for a new jail in 2006, before Pepper became a county commissioner.

""The voters had two chances to solve the problem, and they turned it down both times,"" Leis said in a phone interview.

The fact remains, however, that Pepper voted in favor of a county budget he knew would reduce the sheriff’s staff and shutter an 822-bed jail at a time when prisoner overcrowding already was a longtime problem.

Early releases of prisoners spiked to 501 in 2009 after Queensgate was closed in late 2008. The county saw 143 early releases in 2008 and 106 in 2007, according to the sheriff’s department.

So there’s no doubt the county budget Pepper approved resulted in laid off cops, the shuttering of a prison and more criminals on the street.

But Yost’s claim exaggerates Pepper’s role in the matter. And it says Pepper closed multiple jails, when only one was closed as a result of the 2009 budget.

Each commissioner’s vote carries equal weight, yet the video solely blames Pepper for the actions of the entire board, made of two Democrats and one Republican. Solely blaming Pepper also excuses the sheriff, who ultimately decides how to spend the money commissioners allot him.

And the county’s hand was forced when voters rejected the 2007 tax increase to fund public safety.

Bill White says Perry is a 25-year incumbent
","
The major gubernatorial candidates seem to get their kicks out of plastering each other with derogatory labels. 
In Gov. Rick Perry's campaign statements, his Democratic rival is ""liberal trial lawyer Bill White."" To White's campaign, the GOP governor is ""part-time Perry."" 
Another White tactic: bringing attention to Perry's many years as an elected official by calling him a ""career politician."" Perhaps in that spirit, a Wednesday press release from White linking Perry and a widely expected state budget shortfall pokes at Perry's longevity in an eye-catching secondary headline: ""25 year incumbent focuses on re-election instead of issues."" 
White spokeswoman Katy Bacon told us in an e-mail that the Wednesday reference was to Perry's time ""in one office or another."" 
Indeed, Perry's biography on his state website says his ""political career started in 1985."" That's the year after he was elected as a Democrat to the Texas House of Representatives from a West Texas district. He served three two-year terms, switching to the Republican Party in 1989. 
(When we peeked earlier this week, the Perry bio on his campaign website said he spent four terms in the House, but his campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, acknowledged that the correct number is three. The bio has since been corrected.) 
Perry won election in 1990 as Texas agriculture commissioner, a statewide office he held for two four-year terms. By the end of 1998, Perry had spent 14 years in public office. That year, he won the race for lieutenant governor, and in late 2000, he ascended to the state's highest office when George W. Bush left the governorship to prepare for his swearing-in as president. 
Perry won re-election to the governor's office in 2002 and 2006. 
The tally: As of January 2010, Perry had been in one office or another more than 25 years. 
Then again, White's headline could be taken to mean Perry has been governor all those years, especially because the related press release and video are about his performance as governor. We think that's misleading. 
Also questionable is White's use of the word ""incumbent,"" which implies that Perry was cemented into place a quarter-century ago. According to Webster's New World College Dictionary, an incumbent is ""the holder of an office or benefice."" In common usage, ""incumbent"" usually describes someone running for an office that he or she already holds. 
Bacon said White's campaign was not trying to mislead voters about Perry. ""Everyone knows he's been the governor for 10 years,"" she said. 
Our call: White's poke accurately tabulates Perry's seven-plus terms in four different offices. But describing Perry as a ""25-year incumbent"" in a critique focused on his governorship blurs the fact that most of the time Perry's held office, he's not been governor — or in a single elected position.
