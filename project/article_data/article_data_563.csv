Rand Paul says young people are a major part of the uninsured population
","During a recent appearance on The Daily Show, guest host John Oliver and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., engaged in a lively exchange on health insurance. In the interview, Paul said many of the uninsured are young people. Paul, an eye surgeon, strongly opposed President Barack Obama’s health care law. During the interview, Oliver pressed him on how to get more Americans signed up for insurance. Paul told Oliver that according to the most recent statistics, ""85 percent of people had insurance, so 15 percent didn't. So what you need to do is look at who are the 15 percent, and why don't they have insurance? Of the 15 percent who didn't have insurance, half of them made more than $50,000 a year. Why didn't they buy insurance? Because of the expense. They were young healthy people."" In this item, we’ll check whether the uninsured are predominantly young. In separate items, we’ll look at whether cost of insurance is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans and whether half of the uninsured made more than $50,000 a year. We’ll start by noting that it’s tricky to interpret Paul’s phrasing. One interpretation is that he said uninsured Americans making at least $50,000 are primarily young. Another is that he means that uninsured Americans are disproportionately young, regardless of income level. We didn't get an answer from Paul's staff about which of these he had intended, so we’ll look at both scenarios. Before doing that, we’ll note that the age of uninsured Americans is important because young people have particular insurance needs that are distinct from those of middle-aged and older Americans. Since young people tend to be healthy, they are more likely to be tempted by the option of not buying insurance, particularly if they do not work for a company that offers subsidized insurance. Many young people are averse to paying for the kind of comprehensive coverage attractive to middle-aged Americans and those with families, since young, healthy people aren’t necessarily going to the doctor very often. And this makes it harder to devise policies that push younger people into buying insurance. As Paul put it in the interview, ""They don't need low deductibles. They need very high deductibles. They need insurance for catastrophes, because young people are unlikely to get ill. They need it for the rare occasion, not the everyday occasion."" Are higher-income uninsured Americans mostly young? According to Census Bureau data, uninsured Americans with family incomes above $50,000 break down as follows: Children up to 18: 17 percent of all uninsured Americans with incomes above $50,000 Ages 19 to 29: 27 percent of all uninsured Americans with incomes above $50,000 Ages 30-39: 17 percent of all uninsured Americans with incomes above $50,000 Ages 40-64: 38 percent of all uninsured Americans with incomes above $50,000 (Anyone 65 and older automatically gets Medicare and thus cannot be uninsured. This census data was calculated and provided to PolitiFact by the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.) So about one-quarter of the better-off uninsured are age 19 to 29 -- the age range most people probably think of when they hear the phrase ""young"" in the context of health insurance. Using a broader age range -- from 19 to 39 -- the share rises to 44 percent. That’s a significant percentage, but it’s short of a majority. Are uninsured Americans overall mostly young? Here’s how uninsured Americans break down by age, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of Census Bureau data: Age 0-18: 15.9 percent of all uninsured Americans Age 19-25: 17.3 percent of all uninsured Americans Age 26-34: 21.4 percent of all uninsured Americans Age 35-44: 17.5 percent of all uninsured Americans Age 45-54: 16.4 percent of all uninsured Americans Age 55-64: 11.5 percent of all uninsured Americans So, the percentage of the uninsured who are between ages 19 and 25 is 17.3 percent, while the percentage of the uninsured who are between 19 and 34 is 38.7 percent. That means that ""young"" Americans comprise a significant minority of the uninsured population, though still not a majority. That said, younger people are statistically more likely to be uninsured than either children or middle-aged Americans. Here are the percentages of people in specific age ranges who are uninsured: Age 0-18: 9.7 percent of people in this age range are uninsured Age 19‐25: 27.9 percent of people in this age range are uninsured Age 26‐34: 27.8 percent of people in this age range are uninsured Age 35‐44: 21.2 percent of people in this age range are uninsured Age 45‐54: 17.9 percent of people in this age range are uninsured Age 55‐64: 14.6 percent of people in this age range are uninsured In other words, if you’re a young person, you are more likely to be uninsured than children or middle-aged Americans are. However, if you look at uninsured Americans in the big picture, young people are not the biggest part. Children and middle-aged Americans, combined, account for a larger share of the uninsured population. Our ruling Paul said that many uninsured Americans are ""young."" He’s right that significant numbers of young people lack insurance, and that young people are statistically more likely to be uninsured than either children or middle-aged Americans are. However, it’s worth noting that within the universe of uninsured Americans, young people are not close to a majority. Collectively, children and the middle-aged account for a greater share of the uninsured. On balance, we rate Paul’s comment Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA63180>],/factchecks/2013/aug/16/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-young-people-are-major-part-uninsur/

Cornyn echoes survey on Latino, African American voter turnout, but clarification needed
","Declaring Texas does not discriminate, Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn charged Eric Holder, the U.S. attorney general, with partisan reasons for vowing to restore mandatory federal oversight of voting-related changes in the state. In July 2013, Holder said the Department of Justice would sue to give the federal government a renewed watch-dog role over Texas. Holder spoke after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a provision of the Voting Rights Act that for decades had required Texas and other jurisdictions to win federal pre-approval before implementing changes related to voting. Cornyn, who seeks re-election in 2014, said in an opinion column posted online Aug. 8, 2013 by the Austin American-Statesman that minority voter turnout in Texas is already healthy. ""According to a Census Bureau report, 68.2 percent of registered Hispanic voters in Texas went to the polls in the 2000 general election,"" Cornyn said. ""By 2012, with an additional 747,000 Hispanic Texans on the electoral roll, the rate had risen to 71.2 percent. Meanwhile, the rate for African-American Texans rose to over 86 percent in the same period – the highest among all racial groups tracked in the Census Bureau report."" An Austin Democratic activist, Burnt Orange Report blogger Katherine Haenschen, expressed skepticism of those 2012 percentages in a blog post--and on Twitter, she asked us to look into them. It's no cinch to break down who voted in Texas in 2012. The state does not track voters by ethnicity and 2012 voter exit polls in the state were not extensive enough to generate estimates for how many Latinos and African Americans cast ballots. Government's post-election survey By email, Cornyn spokeswoman Jessica Sandlin pointed out ""The Diversifying Electorate—Voting Rates by Race and Hispanic Origin in 2012 (and Other Recent Elections),"" a May 2013 census bureau report on turnout in presidential elections from 1996 through 2012 based on the bureau’s supplemental Current Population Survey undertaken after each of those elections. Nationally, the report said, voting rates for blacks were higher in 2012 than in recent presidential elections, the ""result of a steady increase in black voting rates since 1996. Voting rates also increased among Hispanics and Asians across some of the elections,"" the report said, ""although these gains were not nearly as consistent as for blacks."" A May 8, 2013, bureau press release led us to detailed charts including one indicating that according to the survey, nearly 1.9 million of more than 2.6 million registered Hispanic voters in Texas, 71.3 percent, turned out in 2012. Also, more than 1.3 million of more than 1.5 million registered African American voters, 86.2 percent, turned out, according to the chart. (Nearly 7 million of more than 8.7 million white registered Texas voters, or 80 percent, turned out, according to the chart, while 220,000 of the state’s 305,000 Asian registered voters, or 72 percent, voted.) These percentages, like Cornyn’s statement, do not represent many citizens eligible to vote who could have voted if they had registered. The survey separately indicates that some 39 percent of the state’s voting-age Hispanic citizens and 63 percent of such African American citizens cast ballots. Over-count? Also, experts have warned that the bureau’s post-election surveys over-estimate turnout. Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Los Angeles-based William C. Velasquez Institute, which focuses on improving the level of Latino political and economic participation, previously told us by telephone there is no perfect way to pinpoint the makeup of any electorate. Gonzalez said then that he respects the bureau’s post-election surveys though they include inflated responses. ""It’s the government asking if you’ve voted or registered to vote,"" Gonzalez said by way of an example. ""So there’s an (unquantified) exaggeration factor."" More recently, Dallas lawyer Michael Li, a redistricting expert who has helped Democrats, said in  a May 11, 2013, blog post that the bureau’s estimates ""tend to overstate actual turnout because people don’t like saying they didn’t vote, especially with something as important as a presidential election."" Too, some voters fudge when asked if they registered to vote, he wrote. By email, Li pointed us to a May 15, 2013, ""Fact Tank"" post by the Pew Research Center stating the bureau’s post-election surveys are ""considered the best source of information on the demographics of the nation’s electorate."" Then again, the center said, the latest survey over-reported total 2012 voters nationally by about 4 million and, it said, African American voters were overcounted, especially in states with the greatest share of blacks in their electorates. ""Might this be because non-voting blacks were more eager than non-voting whites to tell survey takers that they voted for the first ever African-American president?"" the center wrote. ""While there’s no way of knowing for sure, the data are suggestive."" The center said that its analysis did not disprove the bureau’s African American turnout finding. ""Nor does it negate the long-term turnout trends, which show that black turnout has been rising since 1996,"" the center said. ""It may, however, merit an asterisk alongside the claim that blacks turned out at a higher rate than whites in 2012."" In Texas, the bureau survey indicates, more than 8.6 million voters cast ballots. But the Texas Secretary of State says nearly 8 million ballots were cast for president. All told, according to the agency, 59 percent of nearly 13.7 million registered voters cast ballots, compared to 60 percent of 13.6 million registered voters in 2008. In 2008, voter exit polls in Texas indicated that 63 percent of the November voters were white; 20 percent were Latino; 13 percent African American and 2 percent were Asian. Li wrote that the 2012 bureau survey indicates 59 percent of the state’s 2012 voters were Anglo; 22 percent were Hispanic, 16 percent were African American and more than 2 percent were Asian. State voting records, Li wrote, suggest a greater share of Anglo voters and fewer Latino and African American voters. The bureau’s May 2013 report acknowledged the likelihood of discrepancies between its estimates and state voter counts. Ballots sometimes get invalidated during counting and some voters skip voting for president, so their votes would not be rolled into state voter counts, the bureau said. Also, it said, some survey respondents say they voted when they did not, their purpose being to ""appear to behave in a socially desirable way."" Sandlin said by email that the bureau survey remains the ""best option"" for gauging Texas voter participation by race. Democratic analysis of voting records There is at least one other way to estimate participation. Li said in his blog post that state records revealing who voted suggest that about half the state’s Latino registered voters and 68 percent of African American registered voters cast ballots. From the same records, he wrote, it looks like Anglos and African Americans turned out in greater relative force than Hispanics. However, Li noted, the records indicate African American turnout trailed Anglo turnout, contrary to the bureau survey results. Also, Li wrote, while the bureau survey indicates Hispanic turnout in Texas trailed Anglo turnout by about 12 percentage points, the voting records suggest Latino turnout lagged by nearly double that. Broadly, he wrote, the number of registered Texas voters ""has been relatively flat for the better part of a decade despite burgeoning Hispanic and African-American growth during that same period -- both in total and citizen voting age populations,"" an indication that minority turnout remains a challenge. Li told us that he relied on Democratic database consultant James Van Sickle of Dallas to reach his characterizations of voters by ethnicity. By telephone, Van Sickle said he drew on various sources to reach conclusions including census data, consumer spending information, voters’ last names and where they live. Seeking more perspective, we emailed pollsters and partisan activists about Cornyn’s claim. Democratic pollster Jeff Smith of Austin replied that his sense is the state’s voter rolls show that 47 percent of Hispanic registered voters turned out compared to 65 percent of African Americans and 61 percent of all Texas voters. He said he identified Hispanic voters based on matching surnames to a file of Hispanic surnames derived from the U.S. Census, also using maiden names when applicable. Black voters were basically identified by another firm, he said. Lynda Tran, a consultant to Battleground Texas, a pro-Democratic group focused on building voter registration and turnout in the state, called Cornyn’s figures accurate, though she said by email that according to the 2012 survey results, Texas ranked 25th in its percentages of Latino citizens who voted and registered Latinos who voted out of 29 states with enough Latino residents to be tabulated by the bureau. Tran said Texas ranked 25th in registered African Americans who voted out of 33 tallied states. Our ruling Cornyn said that according to the census bureau, 71.2 percent of Hispanic registered voters in Texas and over 86 percent of African American registered voters participated in the 2012 elections. This echoes a result from the bureau’s quadrennial post-election survey, though it doesn't account for another result indicating that far fewer Latino and African American voting-age Texans voted--and the survey also tends to overestimate participation. Separately, Democratic analyses of voting records suggest that no more than half of Hispanic registered voters and 68 percent of African American registered voters went to the polls. We rate this statement, which lacks these clarifications and additional information, as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA4EB40>],/factchecks/2013/aug/16/john-cornyn/cornyn-echoes-survey-latino-african-american-voter/
"['Georgia', 'Medicaid', 'Kathleen Sebelius']","
Obama official touts lower Medicaid spending
","The Obama administration’s top health care official recently gave a speech in Atlanta and made some specific comments about Medicaid spending that we wanted to diagnose. PolitiFact Georgia was alerted to comments U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius made on the topic through Twitter posts from people  who heard her speak. ""Sebelius says Medicaid spending dropped 1.9% in 2012. First time in 47 years,"" one person tweeted. But as we’ve learned with the popular social media tool, you can’t always tell the whole story about something in 140 characters. Sebelius offered more context in her speech. ""(D)espite some of the rhetoric in Washington, the cost outlook for Medicaid is as strong as it’s been in a long time,"" Sebelius said during her speech to the National Conference of State Legislatures. ""In 2012, Medicaid spending per beneficiary actually fell 1.9 percent, the first time it had fallen in 47 years, except for the year when prescription drug costs shifted to Medicare Part D."" PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know whether Sebelius was correct that Medicaid spending per beneficiary declined by nearly 2 percent last year. We also wanted to find out how many times there has been a decline since the program was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. Medicaid has been a big issue in Georgia over the past year. The state’s top political leaders have refused to join the Obama administration’s plans to expand Medicaid coverage, starting in 2014. Sebelius told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in an exclusive interview during her recent visit here that the state’s stance would hurt many working-poor families. But Georgia leaders say the state cannot afford to pay for the estimated 650,000 residents who would be eligible for Medicaid under the expansion. The federal government has pledged to pick up nearly the entire tab in the coming years. Georgia leaders are dubious Washington can follow through with such a commitment and fear state taxpayers might have to foot the bill. There have been many news accounts in recent years about the rise in spending on Medicaid, which provides health services to many low-income Americans. An estimated 54 million Americans receive Medicaid, according to congressional testimony. Medicaid spending has consistently grown higher than the nation’s economic input. The costs rose dramatically in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Many fear it is a budget buster unless costs are brought under control. So how could Sebelius be right about a cost decline? The secretary’s office sent us an actuarial report it put together to support her claim. It was a report on the current fiscal health of the Medicaid program, with statistics on past, present and future spending. ""Acute care fee-for-service Medicaid expenditures are projected to grow at an average rate of 5.7 percent per year over the next decade. In 2012, these expenditures are estimated to have declined by 1.9 percent. But they are projected to increase in 2013 and later years,"" the report says on Page 27. By 2012, the report means the federal government’s fiscal year 2012, which began Oct. 1, 2011, and ended Sept. 30, 2012. Sebelius said in her speech that Medicaid spending in 2020 will be 14 percent lower than previously projected. One government spreadsheet we looked at showed federal Medicaid spending rose steadily since its creation. The only years we saw a decline were in 2006, the year when Medicare Part D took effect, and in 2011, which would include portions of fiscal year 2012. Medicare Part D was a drug benefit plan that federal officials said would save seniors money. Medicaid recipients eligible for the Part D benefits were automatically enrolled into the new Medicare program, which lowered total Medicaid spending, federal officials say. ""As a result of this shift in coverage, Medicaid drug spending (net of rebates) decreased 44 percent from 2005 to 2006,"" according to the Medicaid report that a HHS official sent us. The same HHS report attributed the 2012 decrease in Medicaid spending on a decline in costs on hospital services and prescription drugs. Some news accounts said fewer new recipients added to the Medicaid rolls helped decrease spending. The HHS report says that was a small factor. The report credits the controversial Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as being another small factor in the spending decline. Other organizations sent us reports with similar findings: The only other year Medicaid spending decreased was in 2006. To sum up, Sebelius said per capita Medicaid spending declined by about 2 percent in 2012, the first time in the history of the program that happened, aside from 2006. The reports we reviewed confirm her claim. She was making a much larger point: That Medicaid costs might not increase as rapidly as some had predicted, even though they will still go higher. The federal government has warned spending is going to rise again sharply in the next few years. Her claim is accurate but could have used a little more context. We rate this claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC61AF80>],/factchecks/2013/aug/16/kathleen-sebelius/obama-official-touts-lower-medicaid-spending/
"['Abortion', 'Crime', 'Texas', 'Wendy Davis']","
Surveys show wide disagreement on number of rape-related pregnancies per year
","In an opinion piece in the July 15, 2013, Washington Post, state Sen. Wendy Davis gave reasons ""why I stood up for Texas women"" in a filibuster against abortion restrictions that drew national attention. Among them: ""Each year, about 25,000 American women ... become pregnant through rape or incest,"" wrote the Fort Worth Democrat. A Democratic effort to exclude victims of rape and incest from the Texas restrictions eventually proved futile, as did Davis’ filibuster; the measure was signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry on July 18, 2013. We remained curious about Davis’ rape-or-incest statistic. Davis spokesman Rick Svatora told us via email that the number came from a media fact sheet posted online by NARAL Pro Choice America, an abortion rights advocacy group formerly called the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. The fact sheet says, ""Each year, approximately 25,000 women in the United States become pregnant as a result of rape."" There are no incest pregnancy statistics on the sheet, and we found none in other sources. Dean Kilpatrick, director of the National Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center at the Medical University of South Carolina, told us by phone that although rape and incest often are mentioned together in abortion laws, there is little research on incest, a difficult area to study for reasons that include underreporting. By email, Svatora provided two articles on rape-related pregnancy: A 1996 Medical University of South Carolina analysis of the federally-funded 1990-92 National Women’s Study of 3,031 women over 18. (Kilpatrick worked on both the study and the analysis.) The analysis concluded that among rape victims aged 12 to 45, 5 percent of rapes resulted in pregnancies, and, using the study’s figure of 683,000 ""forcible rapes"" in 1990, estimated that ""there may be 32,101 rape-related pregnancies annually among American women older than 18 years."" A 2000 article in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, using the 1996 analysis’ estimated rate of 5 percent pregnancies from rape, assumed a 50 percent drop in rapes since 1992 to reach an estimate of 25,000 pregnancies from rape in 1998. The NARAL Pro Choice America fact sheet attributes its 25,000 figure to the 2000 article, and a spokeswoman for the group, Samantha Gordon, said via email that is its most recent estimate. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention don’t keep data on pregnancy due to rape, nor does the U.S. Department of Justice, spokeswomen told us via email, while spokesman Greg Phillips at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said the 32,000 figure is ""the best estimate we have now."" Kilpatrick said reasons why the 1996 analysis he worked on is still cited include the National Women’s Study’s large population sample and the fact that more recent research has tended to support its 5 percent rate. The Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, a Washington, D.C.-based charity, reached a much lower figure by doing the same calculation with an estimate from the Justice Department’s 2005 National Crime Victimization Survey. On its website, the network takes the survey’s annual average of 64,080 rapes committed in 2004 and 2005 and applies the 5 percent pregnancy rate to reach an estimate of 3,204 pregnancies a year from rape. That’s ten times less than the 1996 estimate of 32,000. The biggest reason for that difference: According to federal statistics, rapes -- like other violent crimes -- declined significantly in the U.S. during those years. Crime experts have said the decline shown by federal data that began in the 1990s was part of a long-term pattern. They cited falling crack cocaine use, a strong economy and other societal factors, with some citing tougher police strategies. A March 2013 federal Bureau of Justice Statistics report, ""Female Victims of Sexual Violence, 1994-2010,"" compiled statistics from the National Crime Victimization Survey showing that average annual completed rapes dropped 65 percent from 402,000 in 1995 to 143,300 in 2010. Using the method the 1996 and 2000 researchers did -- multiplying the rape counts by the 5 percent pregnancy rate -- we calculated that there could have been 20,100 pregnancies from rape in 1995 and many fewer, 7,165, in 2010. On the other hand, Kilpatrick disagreed with the results of the federal survey, which he said misses most rape cases in large part because its questions are framed in the context of crime and can leave doubt about exactly what’s being asked. An Interviewee, he said, might respond ""no"" to the question ""Have you ever been raped?"" but answer yes when asked if she had ever experienced specific behaviors such as a man forcing his penis into her vagina. He and his colleagues estimated higher numbers of rapes in the 1990-92 survey and in a 2007 follow-up, estimating in both studies that only about 17 percent of rapes were reported. In fact, their data showed a 61 percent increase from 1990 to 2006, from 683,000 to 1.1 million rapes. Kilpatrick noted that a 2010 CDC report found a similar total -- 1.3 million women raped in the previous 12 months. His work indicated the percentage of women raped has not changed significantly since the 1990s, he said, while the U.S. population increased. Applying the 5 percent pregnancy rate to a rounded estimate of 1 million rapes yields his 50,000 figure. We also checked FBI-collected crime statistics, mindful that they include only rapes reported to local law enforcement agencies. In 2011, according to the FBI’s most recent finalized rape statistics, 83,425 forcible rapes were reported to law enforcement. Multiplying that by the 5 percent rate suggests 4,171 pregnancies resulting from reported rapes that year. If that FBI figure represented about 20 percent of rapes committed, in line with Kilpatrick’s research, the total would be 417,125 rapes. Applying the 5 percent pregnancy rate suggests about 20,900 pregnancies could have resulted from rape in 2011. To sum up, we found or calculated these estimates cited from 2010 through 2012, all taking into account unreported plus reported, all based on an assumption of 5 percent chance of pregnancy:   3,200 -- From national anti-sexual-violence organization. 7,165 -- Our calculation with federal data for 2010 released in 2013. 20,900 -- Our calculation with FBI reported-rape data for 2011, adjusting for assumption that only 20 percent of rapes were reported. 32,000 -- Based on 1990 study but still in use by the obstetricians and gynecologists’ group. 50,000 -- Kilpatrick’s estimate based on 2007 and 2010 research showing approximately 1 million rapes. By phone, Svatora noted that Davis’ number fell within that range. Our ruling Davis said, ""Each year, about 25,000 American women ... become pregnant through rape or incest."" She offered no backup for the incest part of the statement, and we found none. Estimates of rape-related pregnancies per year vary from 3,200 to 50,000. Davis’ number, despite dating from 1998, fits inside that range, but there is too much disagreement for us -- or Davis -- to pin any one statistic as the definitive number of rape-related pregnancies per year. We rate her statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAC8400>],/factchecks/2013/aug/15/wendy-davis/surveys-show-wide-disagreement-number-rape-related/

Rand Paul, on 'Daily Show,' says cost is biggest barrier for the uninsured
","During a recent appearance on The Daily Show, guest host John Oliver and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., engaged in a lively exchange on health insurance. One of the issues they discussed was the high cost of health insurance. Paul, an eye surgeon, is strongly opposed to President Barack Obama’s health care law. During the interview, Oliver pressed him on how to get more Americans signed up for insurance. Paul told Oliver that according to the most recent statistics,  ""85 percent of people had insurance, so 15 percent didn't. So what you need to do is look at who are the 15 percent, and why don't they have insurance? Of the 15 percent who didn't have insurance, half of them made more than $50,000 a year. Why didn't they buy insurance? Because of the expense. They were young healthy people."" In this fact-check, we’ll check whether the cost of insurance is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans. In a separate report, we’ll look at his claim that half of the uninsured made more than $50,000 a year. Survey data consistently shows that cost is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans obtaining coverage. When the Kaiser Family Foundation’s June 2013 health tracking poll asked uninsured respondents for the main reason they didn’t have health insurance, a plurality of 40 percent cited cost. The second-biggest factor, at 26 percent, was related to employment, such as being unemployed or having a job that doesn’t offer health insurance. These two reasons aren’t mutually exclusive -- someone could have told the pollster that their lack of a job was the biggest reason but also find cost to be a barrier to obtaining insurance. The only answer in the poll that suggests the respondent doesn’t face a cost obstacle is ""doesn’t need insurance,"" which was the answer of only 11 percent. In another survey, the 2011 National Health Interview Survey, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers asked, ""Which of these are reasons you stopped being covered or don’t have health insurance?’’ Respondents were allowed to choose more than one reason. In this survey, too, a plurality -- 42 percent -- cited cost. Three other reasons cited are compatible with cost being an obstacle -- a lost job or a change in employment (26 percent), an employer that didn’t offer insurance (11 percent) and ineligible due to age or leaving school (9 percent). Just 6 percent cited ""other,"" which included ""didn’t want or need coverage,"" among other answers. ""The cost of insurance is a major reason why people are uninsured -- Sen. Paul is right about that,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. ""People without access to employer-sponsored coverage have a hard time affording it on their own, and that accounts for most of the uninsured."" Our ruling Paul asked, ""Why didn't (uninsured Americans) buy insurance? Because of the expense."" Survey data supports him. A plurality of respondents in major surveys of the uninsured specifically cite cost as a barrier, and relatively few indicate that going uninsured is a voluntary choice. We rate Paul’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6C9540>],/factchecks/2013/aug/15/rand-paul/rand-paul-daily-show-says-cost-biggest-barrier-uni/

Paul, an eye surgeon, is strongly opposed to President Barack Obama’s health care law. During the interview, Oliver pressed him on how to get more Americans signed up for insurance.

Why didn't they buy insurance? Because of the expense. They were young healthy people."" In this fact-check, we’ll check his claim that half of the uninsured made more than $50,000 a year. In a separate report, we’ll look at whether the cost of insurance is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans. We’ll start by noting that Paul is very close to the mark when he says 15 percent of Americans don’t have insurance. The most recent Census Bureau statistics for 2011 show that 15.7 percent of Americans are uninsured. What about the income breakdown for that 15 percent? There are a few different ways to slice the data, but none produces a number for $50,000-plus earners that reaches the 50 percent level Paul offered on The Daily Show. In a September 2012 paper, the Employee Benefits Research Institute looked at 2011 census data on health coverage. It found that 28 percent of the uninsured earned at least $50,000. That’s quite a bit lower than what Paul had indicated. The highest plausible percentage cited by our experts -- who included both liberals and conservatives -- used census data for households rather than for individuals. Using this method, 37.5 percent of the uninsured live in a household with an income above $50,000. Why the variation between household and individual data? Uninsured young adults who are roommates might live in a household where all roommates collectively make more than $50,000, even if each roommate individually earns much less. This type of living arrangement tends to boost the count of uninsured adults who ""earn"" more than $50,000, even if they really don’t make that much individually. This difference in counting methods matters in this sort of statistical comparison because people without health insurance ""are more likely to be living in less-common housing arrangements -- more in multi-generation families, more living with people who aren't related to them,"" said Hanns Kuttner, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. When we showed our calculations to Paul’s office, communications director Moira Bagley said there’s significant uncertainty in the Census data due to ""inexact data collection"" that ""under-reports the numbers of people who actually have health insurance."" This refers to an argument made by some critics of Obamacare that the Census Bureau undercounts Medicaid recipients compared to the total cited by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Subtracting these uncounted Medicaid recipients leaves the pool of uninsured Americans relatively better off. However, each of the seven ideologically diverse health policy experts we talked to for this story used the census numbers when we asked them to evaluate Paul's claim, and none expressed concerns about the ability of the census data to fairly evaluate the question. Our ruling Paul said that of the roughly 15 percent of Americans who don’t have health insurance, ""half of them made more than $50,000 a year."" In reality, if you measure what individuals make, Census data shows that 28 percent of uninsured Americans earn $50,000. By another measure, using household income, almost 38 percent of uninsured Americans earn at least $50,000. Both of these figures are pretty far from the 50 percent Paul cited in the interview. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6C9140>],/factchecks/2013/aug/15/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-half-uninsured-americans-make-least/

West hits sour notes in Grammy claim
","PolitiFact Georgia typically limits its fact-checking to politicos and power brokers who make an impact on the political process. But sometimes the worlds of politics and entertainment intersect. Such is the case for rapper-producer Kanye West, who just happens to have metro Atlanta connections. West is one of the most recognizable and best-selling musicians around. But he has also had his share of  run-ins with the top rungs of the political class, including Republican and Democratic presidents. He evoked the ire of President George W. Bush in 2005 by telling the country during a televised benefit concert in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina that ""George Bush doesn’t care about black people."" Bush later said that the suggestion was an ""all-time low"" of his presidency. President Barack Obama called West a derogatory term after the rapper infamously interrupted singer Taylor Swift during her acceptance speech at the 2009 Video Music Awards. The president slammed West again in a follow-up interview. Just a couple of weeks ago, Obama criticized the over-the-top lifestyle of West and the entertainer’s unmarried mother of his child, Kim Kardashian. Obama questioned the effect the West-Kardashian lifestyle would have on impressionable young people who view them as role models. So we decided to check West’s statement about his place in popular culture. (Visit our Facebook page and let us know what you think: www.facebook.com/politifact.georgia.) About a week before the release of his album ""Yeezus,"" The New York Times published an extensive interview with the Chicago rapper. During that interview while discussing his Grammy wins, West said, ""I don’t know if this is statistically right, but I’m assuming I have the most Grammys of anyone my age, but I haven’t won one against a white person."" He continued: ""But the thing is, I don’t care about the Grammys; I just would like for the statistics to be more accurate."" West’s claims about having the most golden gramophones piqued our interest, so we decided to run them through the AJC Truth-O-Meter. West is a hometown boy. Although he claims Chicago as his home, the rapper was born in Atlanta before moving with his mother to the Windy City at age 3. His parents met and married in Atlanta, according to a  book by West’s mother. His father, Ray West, was one of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s earliest black photographers. The AJC recently compiled a slideshow of some of his photographs taken while working at the paper. To check out Kanye West’s claims, we first contacted his publicist, Gabe Tesoriero at Island Def Jam Music Group. Tesoriero asked what our story was about. We detailed the claims we were checking and the PolitiFact process. Tesoriero provided no further response. The official Grammys website says the honors are awarded annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and recognize achievement in the music industry during the previous year. The first Grammy Awards were held in May 1959. Slate Magazine also checked out West’s claims. The online magazine found that he was partially accurate. At age 36 and with 21 Grammy wins (out of 53 nominations), West has the most awards for anyone his age, Slate said. But he has beaten out several white artists for the awards, including fellow rappers Eminem and the Beastie Boys. We reviewed a list of Grammy statistics compiled by Wikipedia. Doing our own research, we counted each Grammy for artists ahead of West on the list of Grammy wins. We checked the artists’ biographies to determine their 36th birthday to compare their wins by that age. West’s 21 wins ties him with composer and pianist John Williams for the eighth most Grammy wins. Our research found that singer-songwriter Alison Krauss (with 27 Grammys) appears to have tied West’s 21 wins by age 36, according to official past winner information and biographical data we checked. (As a group, rock band U2 earned its 22 awards before 2012, when the band would have been together 36 years.) But other award winners with more Grammys ahead of West on the list -- including Quincy Jones and Stevie Wonder -- had not reached the 21-award mark by their 36th birthdays. The King of Pop, Michael Jackson, by the way, earned 12 Grammys by his 36th birthday. As to whether West has ever beaten out any white artists, he has. For example, in 2005, West beat nominees including Eminem for best rap solo performance with ""Gold Digger."" But all of West’s Grammy wins have been in the rap and R&B categories, which are dominated by black artists. He has never won overall Grammys in categories such as Album of the Year and Record of the Year. Multiple music critics have criticized the Grammys for overlooking West in these broad categories. Writers for Time and the Los Angeles Times cried foul when West’s ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"" wasn’t nominated for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammys. The Slate Magazine writer who also examined West’s Grammy claims noted that ""West believes that he has been shut out from the ‘bigger’ awards ... in part because he’s black."" West’s opinions about his Grammy standings are his own and not for Politifact Georgia to check. But on the facts, West claimed he has won the most Grammys for anyone his age. One other individual artist, Alison Krauss, has tied this feat. On his claim that he’s never beaten out a white artist for a Grammy, West is incorrect. He has beaten white artists in album and song categories. We rate his claims Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAE6E40>],/factchecks/2013/aug/15/kanye-west/west-hits-sour-notes-grammy-claim/

Sen. Ted Cruz says Obama 'just granted all of Congress an exception' to Obamacare
","Sen. Ted Cruz wants Congress to refuse to fund Obamacare. The law’s such a mess, says the Texas Republican, that the president let lawmakers themselves off the hook. ""Look, the wheels are coming off this,"" he told the audience at the conservative Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 10, 2013. ""The Teamsters are abandoning it. President Obama just granted all of Congress an exception. And he did it because Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats who passed this thing came begging and said, ‘Please, please, please let us out of Obamacare.’ This thing ain't working."" The audience let out a long ""Boooo"" at the mention of President Barack Obama’s action on behalf of Congress. But did he just grant lawmakers an exception to Obamacare? ‘Congress should get the same coverage’ For many years, Congress chose from a variety of insurance plans offered by the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, which serves more than 8 million federal and retired workers and their dependents. That stops in January, when lawmakers and some staff will be required instead to pick from plans on the health care law’s new exchanges — now known as marketplaces. That’s because Congress faces a specific Obamacare provision forcing lawmakers from their current plans into new marketplaces — something that doesn’t apply to other Americans. (Most people with health care through large employers won’t see significant changes under the law. They’re not required to use the marketplaces, which were designed to offer more options for small businesses and the uninsured.) Back in 2009, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley argued that ""members of Congress should get the same coverage that we are coming up with for everyone else."" He offered an amendment that required lawmakers to get their health care through the marketplaces created by the bill. It was accepted by the Senate Finance Committee without objection. Members of Congress and their staff would have to use the hefty employer contribution they used for federal plans to buy marketplace plans, instead, his amendment said. ""My interest in having members of Congress participate in the exchange is consistent with my long-held view that Congress should live under the same laws it passes for the rest of the country,"" Grassley said. ""The more that Congress experiences the laws it passes, the better."" A version of the amendment made it into the law passed by Democrats, but it lacked the clarity of Grassley’s language, raising a question: Would the government’s contribution to lawmakers’ health insurance premiums follow them? (In fact, it lacked specifics on lots of issues, such as: When would the provision kick in? Which federal agency would implement it? Which lawmakers and staffers did it cover? Could lawmakers keep their existing coverage as ""grandfathered plans""?) Mass confusion ensued — along with fear that the law’s ambiguity meant lawmakers and their staffers would lose an employer contribution worth thousands toward their health care plans. They urged the administration for clarification. On Aug. 7, 2013, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management did clear things up, proposing a rule that lawmakers’ purchase of health coverage from the exchanges — now called marketplaces — would indeed be eligible for an employer contribution. (It answered some of those other questions, too.) When Obamacare’s health care marketplaces launch in January 2014, members of Congress will use them right alongside the uninsured. ‘An exception’ Did the administration's decision constitute an ""exception"" to Obamacare? Here's what the law said:  ""Notwithstanding any other provision of law … the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are — (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act)."" All it did was require lawmakers to use new marketplaces. They're doing that.  Beyond that, the wording of the law left lots of questions. Or, as the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service described it, several ""legal and practical issues."" To implement it, administrators had to make choices about what it meant. As a New York Times report noted last year, ""In writing the legislation, members of Congress apparently assumed that the federal contribution to their premiums would continue, but the law is silent on the question."" Grassley himself insisted last year that the provision made ""no changes to the employer contribution to federal employee health care coverage."" A Congressional Research Service analysis found some room in the law for employer contributions. Timothy Jost, an expert in health care law who supports the Affordable Care Act, told PolitiFact the government clearly acted within its regulatory authority. A report from the conservative Heritage Foundation, which Cruz’s office pointed to, argues the opposite. Heritage, whose lobbying arm Heritage Action has launched a ""Defund Obamacare Town Hall Tour,"" says that the administration disregarded the law to give a ""special Obamacare deal to Congress."" The special deal: letting lawmakers keep the employer contribution toward health plans on new Obamacare marketplaces that Grassley assumed they would keep. Our ruling Cruz, reeling off signs Obamacare’s ""wheels are coming off,"" said the president ""just granted all of Congress an exception."" That sounds like lawmakers get to opt out of health care under the law. Quite the opposite — they'll use new marketplaces alongside the uninsured and small businesses, just as it required. And it's not even accurate to say they were excepted from some provision of the law: the law itself wasn't clear. Instead, they got a clarification about the law’s effect on contributions toward their health insurance — which they will purchase on Obamacare’s marketplaces. We rate Cruz’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA4E840>],/factchecks/2013/aug/14/ted-cruz/sen-ted-cruz-says-obama-just-granted-all-congress-/

60 percent of St. Petersburg car thefts due to keys left in car, mayor says
","St. Petersburg Mayor Bill Foster interrupted last week's mayoral forum with an important public service announcement: Don't leave your keys in the car. No, really. The plea came in the middle of a discussion on crime, with Foster noting that good police work can't overcome people's lack of common sense. ""Sixty percent of the auto thefts that we have in the city are caused by people leaving their keys in the car,"" Foster said. The problem is so bad, city officials say, that the Police Department created a sassily named mascot Willie Everlern to help spread the message to residents. In a black-and-white video, Everlern is shocked to discover that his car was heisted after he left the keys inside while he walked into a convenience store. We wondered if the situation in St. Petersburg can actually be this bad. Lo and behold, it’s worse. Out of the 551 cars stolen so far this year, 460 of them had keys either in the ignition or elsewhere in the vehicle, Police Chief Chuck Harmon said. That’s 83.4 percent. ""If I were a car thief, I’d move to St. Petersburg,"" said Frank Scafidi, spokesman for the National Insurance Crime Bureau, when told of the numbers. Scafidi said the percentage might be a ""high-water mark"" in the country. Over the past several years, car technology has made vehicles harder to steal with screwdrivers and other tools. Many new cars have transponder keys, which means someone can’t unlock or start the car unless the key fob is close to the vehicle. As a result, St. Petersburg has seen a 70 percent drop in auto thefts over the past decade, Harmon said. As a result, people leaving their keys in their cars has become an increasing source of car thefts in the city. The thefts are crimes of opportunity, so 96 percent of cars are recovered later where the thief ran out of gas. Most area offenders are not trying to bring cars to chop shops or resell high-end models. People are just capitalizing on careless driver mistakes. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 40 to 50 percent of auto thefts nationwide are due to keys in the car. Just lock your cars, people. As Harmon said, ""It’s not rocket science."" One other note: It’s technically illegal to leave your car unattended and running. So not only do you run the risk of having your car stolen, the police could issue you a ticket. Our ruling Foster said that 60 percent of car thefts occur because the owner left keys inside the vehicle. In St. Petersburg this year, it’s actually 83.4 percent. An expert said that might be tops in the country. The specific number aside, Foster’s point that many auto thefts can easily be avoided is 100 percent on the mark.

Matt Bevin says Mitch McConnell pushed bank bailout through Senate
","A 46-year-old wealthy investment manager in Kentucky is mounting a Republican primary challenge to the state’s senior senator, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Matt Bevin comes from the tea party wing of the GOP. Early polls suggest Bevin has a ways to go before he could unseat McConnell, but Kentucky voters sent libertarian favorite Sen. Rand Paul to Washington, and Bevin has the money to get his message to party activists. The two candidates have begun trading attack ads. The latest from Bevin ties McConnell to the financial rescue measures passed by Congress as the economy headed into a tailspin in 2008. Here’s the key text from Bevin’s ad: Announcer: After pushing the Wall Street bailout through the U.S. Senate, Mitch McConnell bragged (video clip of McConnell) ""This has been the Senate at its finest."" Announcer: And what are fact-checkers saying about Mudslinging Mitch’s latest attacks on conservative Matt Bevin?  Misleading (image from Washington Post) Doesn’t add up (image from local Fox news) Like Obama campaign attacks (image from Washington Post) After 30 years in Washington, voting for one bailout after another, slinging mud is all Sen. McConnell has left. The ad plays to antigovernment sentiment among people who see Washington’s multibillion dollar intervention in 2008 as a gross overreach of public power and a favor to the financial elite. We will examine this specific claim the ad makes to link McConnell to specific actions. Did McConnell push the bailout, formally known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP, through the Senate? To answer that, we have to go back to September and October 2008. As the housing market bubble burst, the web of investments that bound just about every financial player to each other threatened a global freeze on lending. On Sept. 29, 2008, three days before the Senate vote on TARP, two leading voices from the conservative think tank, the Heritage Foundation, described the situation. In ""The bailout package: Vital and acceptable"", Edwin Meese, President Ronald Reagan’s attorney general, and Stuart Butler wrote: ""Some key parts of the credit market are on the verge of gridlock, resulting not just in the collapse of major financial institutions but also in credit disruption that is severely weakening the long-term prospects of non-financial companies. And while this is currently most visible in Wall Street and in the financial sector, it is only a matter of time before the fallout hits Main Street, with potentially devastating economic effects for typical American households."" President George W. Bush was pressing for passage of a $700 billion bailout. So were GOP presidential nominee John McCain and the Democratic nominee, Barack Obama. In late September, an effort to get a bill through the House of Representatives had just failed. The action shifted to the Senate where McConnell played a key role in negotiations. In a floor speech right before the Senate voted, McConnell took credit for the package and urged his fellow Republicans to approve the emergency intervention. ""After extensive consultation between the majority leader and myself and the leaders in both parties here in the Senate, we believe we have crafted a way to go forward and to get us back on track,"" McConnell said. ""This is the only way to get the right kind of solution for the American people."" The Senate passed the TARP on a vote of 74 to 25, with 40 Democrats, one independent and 33 Republicans including McConnell voting in favor. Nine Democrats and 15 Republicans voted against it. On the night the bill passed, McConnell joined Republicans and Democrats in a quick press conference to mark the moment. ""This has been the Senate at its finest,"" McConnell said. ""In the years that I’ve been here, I can’t recall a single time, where in this close proximity to an election, both sides have risen above the temptation to engage in partisan game playing if you will, to address an issue of great magnitude."" We should note that part of the compromise that produced TARP included a provision to release the money in two installments. When a vote came for the second infusion of cash, in January 2009, McConnell joined 32 Republicans and nine Democrats in a failed effort to oppose it. McConnell said he voted for the first installment on the condition that it be used to prevent a systemic economic collapse but didn't like that part of it was used to help the auto industry. ""The current (Bush) administration used these funds for the auto industry, a move that I opposed. Now Congressional Democrats are urging more of the same,"" McConnell said in a statement. ""The American people still don't have assurances that this money will not be wasted or misused to play favorites."" According to a recent Treasury report, of the $420.61 billion dollars spent under TARP including the government’s stake in the insurer American International Group, $420.49 billion has been returned to the government. Our ruling Bevin said that McConnell pushed the Wall Street bailout through the Senate. The record shows that McConnell actively supported emergency government intervention in the financial markets and spoke openly of playing a key role in crafting compromise legislation. However, to say that he pushed the bill through the Senate downplays that other political leaders, including the Republican president and the party’s presidential nominee, also pressed to get the measure passed. The ad also ignores that in January 2009, there was a second bailout funding vote and on that one, McConnell voted no. Still, McConnell worked hard to get the initial bailout through the Senate. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA68600>],/factchecks/2013/aug/14/matt-bevin/matt-bevin-mitch-mcconnell-bank-bailout-efforts/

Mitch McConnell tags Kentucky primary opponent as tax delinquent
","The 2014 Kentucky Senate race will ultimately be a referendum on Republican versus Democratic policies, but before we get to that point, the state’s senior senator, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell must first get through the GOP primary. He faces a challenge from well-to-do businessman and tea party activist Matt Bevin. In a state that elected Sen. Rand Paul, a magnet for the libertarian wing of the Republican Party, McConnell is treating this as a real challenge. McConnell’s latest ad is called ""Delinquent"" and it casts Bevin as a man who repeatedly fails to pay his taxes and then denies the habit. Here’s the key text from the ad: Announcer: Bevin says (video clip) ""I have no tax delinquency problem, nor have I ever."" Announcer: But Bevin’s business failed to pay taxes at least eight times. And was the No. 1 tax delinquent. Bevin also failed to pay taxes on his million-dollar home in Maine. Despite official documents, Bevin says (video clip) ""I have no tax delinquency problem nor have I ever."" Announcer: Bailout Bevin. How can you believe him on anything? We contacted the McConnell campaign, and they told us that the business that didn’t pay taxes is Bevin Brothers Manufacturing in East Hampton, Conn. Bevin Brothers makes bells -- cow bells, brass hand bells, door bells, sleigh bells and so on. It’s been making bells since 1832 and on its website, it speaks with pride of being the ""only remaining company manufacturing just bells in the United States."" The Bevin family has overseen the firm for six generations. Matt Bevin became wealthy managing the portfolios of institutional investors. An uncle in Connecticut owned and ran Bevin Brothers. According to a letter provided by the Bevin campaign, the factory foreman, Doug Dilla, contacted Matt Bevin in 2008 and asked him to intervene to save the company. The uncle was ill, and the firm ""was in debt and not meeting its obligations,"" Dilla wrote. Dilla wrote that letter in July 2013 at the Bevin campaign’s request. The McConnell campaign sent us copies of tax records showing the bell maker had fallen behind on paying taxes eight times. The amounts ranged from $21 to over $74,000. That big bill was owed to the Internal Revenue Service, and the record shows that the company failed to pay what it owed in 2008 and in the second quarter of 2009. The question is, as our colleagues at the Washington Post Fact Checker pointed out in their analysis of this ad, can Matt Bevin be held accountable for those unpaid taxes? The IRS lien document is consistent with the storyline of a company facing hard times around 2008. There is no record of Matt Bevin having managerial control of the firm before that point and the extent of his involvement afterward is unclear. According to the Bevin campaign, he began putting money into the bell maker starting in 2008. His uncle remained in charge, at least formally, until August 2011 when the board elected him president and treasurer. The campaign provided an unsigned copy of the shareholder resolution; the signed original, they said, was lost in a major fire at the plant in 2012. The East Hampton town manager, Mike Maniscalco, told us that from what he and other town officials can tell, all those details are accurate. ""The company was definitely struggling, and we are grateful that Mr. Bevin got involved,"" Maniscalco said. ""After the fire, the company had offers from other communities to reopen elsewhere and thankfully, they made the decision to stay and are cranking out bells today."" Maniscalco also affirmed that he wrote a letter to the campaign in which he described Bevin’s successful efforts to pay all back taxes. The ad’s claim that Bevin Brothers Manufacturing had become the area’s top tax delinquent is accurate but is due mainly to the town’s tax base. Residential property taxes account for over 90 percent of revenues; when the bell maker fell behind, the amount it owed stood out. The house in Maine The ad’s final assertion is that Bevin failed to pay taxes on his million-dollar home in Maine. That is accurate but incomplete. In 2007, Bevin did not pay $5,761.07 in property taxes on a home he bought for $1,250,000 in 2001. The house is in the town of Greenwood, Maine. The town’s tax collector, Kimberly Sparks, told us that Bevin had paid his taxes on time every year before 2007 and afterward as well. When Bevin bought the house in 2001, the lender was American Bank and Trust. Typically, along with a mortgage comes an escrow agent that pays the tax bill. Sparks said that sometime around 2007, the lender and escrow agent changed to National City Corporation. ""A lot of times we see that when there’s a change in escrow agents,"" Sparks said, ""property taxes don’t get paid. That’s a common occurrence."" Sparks said the town sends the tax bill to the property owner, and it is up to the owner to forward it to the escrow agent. The McConnell campaign provided a copy of the tax notice sent to Bevin’s Louisville address and noted ""the lien was sent to his house in Louisville, so it would have been hard to miss."" In 2008, National City was collapsing in the sub-prime mortgage debacle and was purchased by PNC Financial Services. The extent to which that was a factor is unclear. According to a letter Sparks wrote at the request of the Bevin campaign, Bevin contacted the town in 2009 ""concerned that his accounts were paid by his new mortgage company"" and ""was surprised to learn of two tax liens."" By February 2009, National City Mortgage paid the back taxes. Our ruling The McConnell campaign ad paints a picture of Matt Bevin as a man with a track record of unpaid taxes. The claim is based on back taxes owed by a bell-making company in Connecticut that was owned by members of the Bevin family, and Bevin’s failure to pay taxes on a vacation house in Maine. With the bell maker, based on the paper trail and interviews, it’s reasonable to conclude that the company was in financial trouble before Bevin was deeply involved. We don’t know all the details of Bevin’s management role, but the town credits him for helping the firm pay its tax bills and later, keeping the business afloat. McConnell’s team says this was Bevin’s business and he was responsible for its failure to pay taxes. But the weight of evidence says he inherited the tax liabilities; the town doesn’t hold him responsible for the nonpayment of taxes, and in fact, regards him in exactly the opposite light. This makes it difficult to see where the McConnell claim holds up.   As for the house in Maine, Bevin showed a lapse in overseeing the property tax payments, but the change in mortgage companies at a time when the lender was headed toward bankruptcy is a significant factor. According to local officials, Bevin took the initiative to correct the problem. In both cases, there is a slim element of truth but the rest of the facts paint a very different picture. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE7AA80>],/factchecks/2013/aug/14/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-tags-kentucky-primary-opponent-tax/
"['Federal Budget', 'Labor', 'State Budget', 'States', 'Unions', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Did FDR oppose collective bargaining for government workers?
","Reaction was swift and strong after Republican Gov. Scott Walker said the curbs he enacted on the collective-bargaining power of public-employee unions were philosophically in line with principles espoused by President Franklin Roosevelt, the liberal Democratic icon. Walker drew the comparison in a July 29, 2013 speech at the Governmental Research Association policy conference hosted by Milwaukee’s Public Policy Forum. The governor, whose Act 10 law wiped away most subjects of bargaining for most public unions and shifted more pension and health-care costs to workers, argued the changes helped balance government budgets and made merit more important than teacher seniority in schools. ""We think it has a dynamic impact going forward on how we perform, and that is putting power in the hands of the people duly elected at the state and at the local level,""  Walker said. ""It’s why -- some people are surprised to know this -- the position I pushed is not unlike the principle that Franklin Delano Roosevelt, not exactly a conservative, pushed as well when it came to public sector collective bargaining,"" Walker added. ""He felt that there wasn't a need -- and others like him, (former New York Mayor Fiorello) LaGuardia and others -- felt there wasn’t a need in the public sector to have collective bargaining because the government is the people. We are the people."" Did Roosevelt -- the patron of the post-Depression boost in organizing by industrial unions in the private sector -- really take the position that when it came to federal government employees, there ""wasn’t a need"" to have collective bargaining? Before we check Walker’s claim, let’s stipulate the obvious: There are dramatic differences between Walker and the architect of the New Deal, from their approaches to governing in times of economic distress to their views on the proper size and role of the state. In the labor realm, when it came to private-sector unions whose cause he championed, FDR called collective bargaining a ""fundamental individual right."" Walker, meanwhile, has not ruled out signing ""right to work"" limits on private-sector unions, though he’s not pushing it now. That’s one reason the comparison so riled Democrats and union leaders. ""FDR brought us out of the Great Depression with strong investment in workers and jobs programs that worked,"" Wisconsin State AFL-CIO leader Phil Neuenfeldt said. ""Scott Walker is drowning in a jobs deficit and to compare himself to FDR is laughably delusional."" But Walker in his speech made a claim on a very specific historical point: FDR’s views on collective bargaining for public employees. And that is the claim we are examining. Where Roosevelt stood Compared to the mountain of evidence on FDR’s sympathetic stance on protections and rights for private laborers, the historical record on his attitude toward public-sector unions is less than a few inches high. Walker cites an on-point and oft-quoted FDR letter that conservatives frequently highlight when arguing for limits on unions in the government sector. That letter, we found, dominates scholarly debate over Roosevelt’s views on this issue. And it’s easy to see why: The president’s Aug. 16, 1937 correspondence with Luther C. Steward,  the president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, is bluntly worded -- to say the least. Roosevelt was responding to an invitation to attend the organization’s 20th jubilee convention. In the letter, FDR says groups such as NFFE naturally organize to present their views to supervisors. Government workers, he observed, want fair pay, safe working conditions and review of grievances just like private-industry workers. Organizations of government employees ""have a logical place in Government affairs,"" he wrote. But Roosevelt then shifted gears, emphasizing that ""meticulous attention should be paid to the special relationships and obligations of public servants to the public itself and to the Government."" Then, the most-famous line and the one directly on point to Walker’s comment: ""All Government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service,"" he wrote. ""It has its distinct and insurmountable limitations when applied to public personnel management."" Roosevelt didn’t stop there. ""The very nature and purposes of Government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with Government employee organizations,"" he wrote. When Walker claimed FDR said ""the government is the people,"" he had Roosevelt’s next line in mind. ""The employer,"" Roosevelt’s letter added, ""is the whole people, who speak by means of laws enacted by their representatives in Congress. Accordingly, administrative officials and employees alike are governed and guided, and in many instances restricted, by laws which establish policies, procedures, or rules in personnel matters."" Roosevelt concluded with a strong stance against strikes by unions representing government workers, noting that NFFE’s bylaws rejected strikes. The letter, the FDR Presidential Library site points out, was released publicly by the Roosevelt White House and became the administration's ""official position"" on collective bargaining and federal government employees. Roosevelt had previously laid out his views on public-sector unions at a July 9, 1937 news conference. His statements there add more weight to Walker’s claim. A reporter directly asked Roosevelt ""whether he favored government employees joining unions to the extent of collective bargaining with the government."" Roosevelt’s response made clear he thought managers should listen to worker concerns, whether raised by union representatives or not. Federal workers are free to join ""any union they want,"" he said. But he recalled that in 1913, when he was Navy assistant secretary, he told a union official the Navy would not enter into a contract with the union because it had no discretion under federal law. ""The pay is fixed by Congress and the workmen are represented by the members of Congress in the fixing of Government pay,"" Roosevelt said. His thinking then still applied, Roosevelt told the reporters in 1937. At the end of news conference, Roosevelt was asked, after making the point that Congress sets compensation: ""In other words, you would not have the representatives of the majority as the sole bargaining agents?"" Roosevelt: ""Not in the government, because there is no collective contract. It is a very different case. There isn’t any bargaining, in other words, with the government, therefore the question does not arise."" Taken together, the letter and news conference remarks positioned Roosevelt as deeply skeptical of the need and wisdom of collective bargaining power for unions in the federal system. When he wrote that the unique circumstances would make it ""impossible"" for government officials to make a binding deal on behalf of the government, that didn’t leave a lot of ambiguity. Same with the phrase ""insurmountable limitations."" What the scholars say Perhaps because of the strong wording of his views, the 1937 letter remains -- nearly 75 years later -- the best piece of evidence on this topic. Even scholars and union officials who chafe at Walker linking himself to FDR have acknowledged the letter’s significance. ""Roosevelt absolutely did not favor collective bargaining for federal workers and especially did not favor the right to strike,"" public-sector labor scholar Joseph McCartin told Salon.com shortly after Walker’s dramatic action in 2011. And the current head of the National Federation of Federal Employees says Roosevelt’s words meant he ""believed that there should be no right to federal bargaining over wages and benefits."" The union chief, William Dougan, told us Roosevelt feared that dealing with multiple unions could lead to pay disparities. To be sure, Roosevelt’s views were in part a product of his time. At the time, government unions had no collective bargaining rights, and it was not uncommon for elected officials to stand against union bargaining rights for government employees. Even in the private-sector, labor rights were still developing, their constitutionality still under debate in the courts. The notion of expanding those powers to the government sector had not yet taken hold -- and it would not under FDR. It wasn’t until 1962 that President John F. Kennedy’s executive order allowed bargaining, and then just over working conditions. Federal unions still cannot bargain over pay and benefits. Still, there are prominent scholarly voices who think Roosevelt’s 1937 letter has been misinterpreted, at least in part. One such voice is McCartin, the Georgetown University history professor who told Salon that ""Roosevelt absolutely did not favor collective bargaining for federal workers and especially did not favor the right to strike."" When we asked McCartin about that interview, he said he had spoken prematurely. He and other historians note that Roosevelt wrote that collective bargaining, ""as usually understood,"" cannot be transplanted into the public service. Historians and union officials have parsed the phrase for decades, debating its meaning, and sometimes disagreeing with each other. The phrase, some say, leaves open the possibility that Roosevelt supported a modified form of collective bargaining, different from what private workers had created. They note that in the letter, Roosevelt directed his opposition most specifically at the right to strike. Dougan, the union official, believes Roosevelt appeared open to bargaining over working conditions. Several scholars emphasize that Roosevelt later praised a union contract negotiated between the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority and unions representing workers for the electric utility created by the federal government in 1933. The TVA’s board, appointed by Roosevelt, chose as a matter of policy to recognize the unions and bargain with them. The TVA Act signed by Roosevelt did not direct or discourage such bargaining. The TVA episode is ""the only effective rebuttal"" offered to the words in FDR’s letter, wrote Wilson R. Hart, a longtime labor relations adviser in the federal government who examined Roosevelt’s thinking on unions. Hart felt that the apparent contradiction between FDR’s TVA comments and his 1937 letter strongly suggested that Roosevelt was not denouncing all elements of collective bargaining in the letter. How Walker’s action compares Scholars, including McCartin, believe FDR’s views might have evolved in favor of public sector bargaining -- and against what Walker did. We won’t judge that for this item, but we’ll end with a few observations regarding the two situations, separated by nearly three-quarters of a century. In substance, Walker’s move dramatically limited, but did not completely end, collective bargaining by most public employees. His Act 10 allowed the state to cut benefits and try to limit pay increases. He argued that unions had become too powerful and that elected representatives of the people should have more control over taxpayer-funded compensation. Roosevelt said in the 1937 press conference that compensation levels for federal employees should be set by Congress and the president, not through bargaining with unions. So both men -- decades apart -- envisioned a limited role for unions in the public sector. But the differences in context make the two men’s views hard to compare. Walker acted after 50 years of collective bargaining between the state and its employees -- in the birthplace of public collective bargaining -- while FDR expressed his views before labor won that toehold into that arena. Our rating Walker said FDR ""felt there wasn’t a need in the public sector to have collective bargaining because the government is the people."" The governor relies -- to good effect -- on Roosevelt’s 1937 letter, which, along with other primary evidence, lays out in striking language FDR’s deep reservations about the need for and wisdom of public-sector bargaining. While Roosevelt was open to discussion with represented and unrepresented employees over working conditions, he seemingly had major concerns about a formal, contractual bargaining process. Scholars cite Roosevelt’s positive comments on the Tennessee Valley Authority labor contracts, and debate certain phraseology in FDR's writings, but it’s limited evidence compared to the clear impression left by the letter and press conference remarks. Roosevelt saw a ""logical place"" for unions in government affairs, but the most compelling evidence suggests he drew the line at collective bargaining with them. We rate Walker’s narrow statement True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE25400>],/factchecks/2013/aug/14/scott-walker/Did-FDR-oppose-collective-bargaining-for-governmen/

St. Petersburg mayoral candidate Rick Kriseman defends record as a state lawmaker
","Rick Kriseman was quick to defend his time as a state representative during the recent Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9 mayoral forum. During the hour-long debate, incumbent Mayor Bill Foster claimed Kriseman was ineffective as a lawmaker representing St. Petersburg. (We’re checking Foster’s specific attack in another fact-check.) Here’s how Kriseman responded: ""For anybody who's trying to cross the street and has seen those signs that say you have to stop when pedestrians are in the crosswalk, that was a bill that I passed, along with a bill that requires people who are convicted of DUI to carry $100,000 of insurance in case they hit somebody else and injure them in an accident. So there are issues and legislation that I have passed."" In this fact-check, we decided to zero in on Kriseman’s claim about crosswalks. Kriseman, a Democrat who served as a legislator from 2006 to 2012, spent two years as policy chairman for House Democrats. Practically, that means he studied up on the legislation scheduled to hit the House floor and advised the Democratic caucus how to vote in a daily meeting. In 2007 and 2008, Kriseman introduced a proposal that required drivers to stop for, rather than simply yield the right of way to, pedestrians legally in, or about to enter, crosswalks. In 2008, the idea (HB 89/SB 154) passed with unanimous votes, but it did not have his name on it. The Senate sponsor, then-Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, got the paper credit.  Kriseman’s version barely budged through the House committee process, with leaders choosing to advance the one with Fasano’s name on it. Why? Party politics. Fasano readily told us Kriseman came up with the proposal, and he asked Fasano to be the Senate sponsor. Fasano, as a member of the majority party, had a better shot at getting it passed. It’s rare for a member of the minority party to have his or name on a bill if a majority party member is sponsoring it in the other chamber, he said. ""That’s politics, in Tallahassee especially,"" Fasano said. ""Not as much in the Senate, but definitely in the House."" Kriseman pointed to other bills he sponsored that became law, including one in 2007 that requires people convicted of DUI to carry 10 times the liability insurance of other drivers, or $100,000 for one injured person. Pinellas County Republican Dennis Jones sponsored the bill in the Senate. The point of the law is to cover medical expenses of DUI victims. Gov. Charlie Crist signed the bill in a St. Petersburg ceremony in which he honored a 40-year-old father who was hit years earlier by a drunken driver as he sat on his motorcycle at a red light. The man, Chris Prati, required around-the-clock medical care and was no longer able to eat or speak, according to Times archives. A local bill bearing Kriseman’s name also got Crist’s signature in 2007. Two years later, a Kriseman-sponsored measure that encouraged service-learning courses in schools ended up in a Republican-sponsored Senate bill that became law. Our ruling Kriseman said, ""For anybody who's trying to cross the street and has seen those signs that say you have to stop when pedestrians are in the crosswalk, that was a bill that I passed."" Kriseman’s name wasn’t on 2008 legislation meant to aid pedestrians, but the Senate sponsor who got credit said it was Kriseman’s idea and that he simply needed a Republican to help get it through the legislative process. We rate Kriseman’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC775F00>],/factchecks/2013/aug/13/rick-kriseman/rick-kriseman-says-he-did-pass-bill-during-his-tim/

Sarah Palin claims weatherization money in stimulus required universal building codes
","Sarah Palin has been a vocal opponent of the economic stimulus package ever since it was proposed by President Barack Obama, and she makes that point again in her new book,  Going Rogue  . Back in March 2009, then-Gov. Palin called the stimulus plan a ""bribe"" intended to ""grow government"" and she vowed to turn down as much as a third of the money available to Alaska.     But the Republican-controlled Alaska Legislature fought her on it, and she ultimately accepted all but 3 percent of the more than $900 million available to Alaska. The 3 percent that she vetoed was $28.6 million in federal stimulus money for weatherization and other projects to make new and existing homes and buildings more energy efficient. She claimed then, as she does again in her book, that the money had not just string but ""ropes"" attached to it that would require the state to adopt universal building codes.     Here's how she described it in the book:     ""The documents clearly stated that acceptance of the funds required the adoption and enforcement of energy building codes,"" she wrote. ""Universal building codes -- in Alaska! A practical, libertarian haven full of independent Americans who did not desire 'help' from government busybodies. A state full of hardy pioneers who did not like taking orders from the feds telling us to change our laws. A state so geographically diverse that one-size-fits-all codes simply wouldn't work.""     At PolitiFact, we looked at that claim in  some detail  back in early June after she said the money would require ""universal energy building codes for Alaska, kind of a one-size-fits-all building code that isn't going to work up there in Alaska.""     Many state legislators in Alaska said Palin was overstating things. Even a number of Republicans in the Alaska Legislature said Palin was wrong. In fact, Anchorage Republican Rep. Mike Hawker was quoted in the  Anchorage Daily News  saying that he believed Palin ""had to do something to save face"" after initially promising to turn away a third of the stimulus money, but then vetoing just 3 percent.     But Palin stuck to her claim, and pointed to a provision in the stimulus that tied the energy efficiency money to assurances that the state or local governments ""will implement"" a ""building energy code for residential buildings that meets or exceeds the most recently published International Energy Conservation Code, or achieves equivalent or greater energy savings"" as well as building energy codes for commercial buildings throughout the state that meet federal standards.     She vetoed the funds even after getting a clarifying letter from Steven G. Chalk of the Department of Energy, who stated that the stimulus provision recognizes that not every state has statewide building codes, and that the governor does not have the authority to force local governments to implement building codes. In those cases, Chalk wrote, it's sufficient for the governor to simply ""promote"" the codes. It is enough, he wrote, for the state to work with local governments to create model energy efficiency standards, but no municipality would be forced to adopt any new codes.   As for Palin's claims of ""one-size-fits-all"" building codes, Chalk wrote that the provision ""provides flexibility with regard to building codes"" and ""expressly includes standards other than those cited so long as the standards achieve equivalent energy savings.""   In August, the Alaska Legislature voted in an emergency session to override Palin's veto of the energy money, an unusual event that requires 75 percent approval.     As for Palin's claim that Alaska is a ""practical, libertarian haven full of independent Americans who did not desire 'help' from government busybodies,"" the Associated Press noted recently that for a state that doesn't ""desire"" help from the federal government, they get an awful lot of it. A  study by the Tax Foundation  of federal taxes paid versus spending received, by state, in 2005 -- the latest year available -- found that Alaska received $1.84 for every federal tax dollar it sent to Washington (ranking Alaska third in the nation that year). It was the 20th year in a row that Alaska got more back from the government than residents paid in federal taxes.   The wording in the stimulus bill related to the weatherization money may have left room for Palin's concerns, but the letter from the Department of Energy made clear that universal building codes were not going to be forced upon state and local governments as a condition for accepting the federal money. Palin's opposition to the funding may give her license to claim she opposed the stimulus plan -- even though it was only a small portion of Alaska's funding -- but her reasoning doesn't jibe with the assurances from the Department of Energy. We rule her claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD2FDC0>],/factchecks/2009/nov/16/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-claims-weatherization-money-stimulus-r/

Maddow says Stupak amendment bars those with subsidies from getting abortion coverage
","An amendment to the House health care bill about abortion coverage continues to inspire political passions, driving a wedge between abortion-rights supporters who are outraged at what they consider a major loss for women's rights, and Democratic lawmakers who dread seeing their long-awaited reform effort potentially stalled due to the highly controversial debate.
 
We've examined the role of  abortion coverage in the health care debate  numerous times, specifically as it relates to this amendment, including  a recent claim by Rep. Nita Lowey  . But on Nov. 12, 2009, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow addressed the issue again, and we thought we'd take another crack at it.

""Congressman Stupak and his supporters say that this Stupak Amendment would simply maintain the status quo,"" Maddow said on her show. ""It should be noted that that's baloney. The Stupak Amendment doesn't just say you can't use your federal insurance subsidy to pay for an abortion, it says, if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money. That's the first bit of dishonesty going on here.""

The amendment, sponsored by Reps. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., and Joe Pitts, R-Pa., was a last-minute addition to the House legislation and passed due to support from Republicans and antiabortion Democrats. It establishes restrictions on how abortion can be covered under the bill's virtual health insurance ""exchanges."" These exchanges are designed to help people buy coverage if they are not currently insured, or if they work for businesses that are too small to offer health coverage to employees.

Essentially, the Stupak-Pitts amendment bars abortion coverage for those who choose the ""public option,"" which is the House bill's federally administered, but privately funded, insurance plan. (Cases of rape, incest or a danger to the life of the mother are exempted.) The amendment also prevents anyone who accepts federal subsidies for health coverage from purchasing a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange.

However, the amendment does allow people purchasing insurance on the exchange to choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without federal subsidies. Those who do accept subsidies can purchase an abortion ""rider"" -- that is, a separate policy covering abortion -- as long as they pay for it entirely with their own money.

Many supporters of abortion rights argue that the amendment represents a severe infringement on a procedure that has been upheld by the Supreme Court. They say that relatively few women will be able to buy insurance on the exchanges without subsidies, making the exception for unsubsidized purchases close to meaningless. And they say that the idea of a ""rider"" isn't all it's cracked up to be. For one thing, abortion-rights supporters argue, women won't be likely to purchase separate coverage for a procedure they never expect to need. In addition, they say, insurance companies will be unlikely to offer abortion coverage because of the bill's logistical hurdles. For instance, the bill requires that insurers offering plans on the exchange that cover abortion also have to offer an identical plan that does not cover abortion.

All of these factors, abortion-rights supporters say, indicate that insurers will simply take the path of least resistance and decline to offer abortion coverage. If this happens, the law could end up diminishing the abortion coverage options for people on the exchange.

In our previous ruling, we drew a distinction between what the law does and what might possibly happen in the law's wake. The law spells out quite clearly that abortion coverage can be obtained on the exchange, even by those who are subsidized. By contrast, the notion that low demand for, and low supply of, abortion coverage could hamper women's access to abortion struck us as a different matter. We concluded that it's too speculative to say that this scenario will definitely come to pass.

As we look at Maddow's statement, we'll start by giving her credit for using more careful wording than have many of her fellow abortion-rights supporters, including the subject of our prior fact-check, Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y. Whether by design or not, Maddow hewed quite closely to the actual language of the amendment when she said that ""if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money."" In fact, the amendment text does, on eight separate occasions, make a distinction between a ""plan"" and ""supplemental coverage.""

Specifically, the amendment says that people who buy subsidized insurance on the exchange cannot buy an insurance ""plan"" that includes abortion coverage. But the amendment does allow subsidized people to purchase ""supplemental coverage"" that covers abortion, as long as they do it with their own money.

We believe that Maddow's failure to mention the option of buying ""supplemental coverage"" -- a rider -- undercuts her broader argument that ""if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money."" We'll concede that the amendment's language does draw a distinction between buying a ""plan"" and buying ""supplemental coverage,"" but the difference is likely to be lost on viewers without expertise either in the insurance business or in legislative drafting.

We ran our argument by Maddow. She gamely disagreed.

""I absolutely stand by my comment,"" she wrote in an e-mail. ""Get real, you guys. It's crazy to argue that the real impact of the Stupak Amendment will be that women receiving federal subsidies (probably the vast majority of women in the exchange) will just buy 'abortion insurance,' since abortion wouldn't be covered as health care under their health insurance anymore. Women are really going to get a specific insurance rider that they'd pay for every month, for a procedure no one ever plans on having or thinks they'll ever have to have? Really? Come on.""

But we think her response only strengthens the argument that the law isn't, itself, barring abortion coverage. Saying, as she does, that the burden of purchasing or not purchasing ""abortion insurance"" would fall to women tacitly confirms that the law does indeed allow subsidized women on the exchange to buy abortion coverage.

Meanwhile, contrary to suggestions that insurers won't offer abortion riders, our research shows that they do exist in at least three of the five states that already have rules similar to the Stupak amendment on the books. In Oklahoma and Kentucky -- both of which which bar insurers from offering elective abortion coverage as part of a comprehensive plan -- regulatory officials told PolitiFact that such riders do exist, because insurance companies must file paperwork with the state before they sell such policies.

In addition, Paula Gianino, president and chief executive for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region, told the  St. Louis Beacon  that she estimates 7 percent to 10 percent of the roughly 6,000 abortions provided annually at its St. Louis facility are covered by private insurance. Since companies in Missouri are banned from purchasing plans with abortion coverage except by rider, these examples show that some abortion riders are being purchased in that state.

However, none of these states keeps track of how many companies offer the riders, or how many people have purchased them.

Ultimately, we'll give Maddow credit for linguistic care, but we continue to hold that the Stupak Amendment does not, as she suggests, prevent subsidized women on the exchange from buying abortion coverage. They can buy a rider that adds that coverage. We rate Maddow's statement Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC8F080>],/factchecks/2009/nov/16/rachel-maddow/maddow-says-stupak-amendment-bars-those-subsidies-/

Sarah Palin says health care reform will be costly
","
Sarah Palin may be in the midst of launching her new book,

Going Rogue

, but she still found time to post a note on her Facebook page criticizing the Democratic plans for health care.


Her note, titled ""Pelosi 'Health Plan' Should Be DOA,"" argued that people shouldn't be compelled by the government to purchase health insurance. She also wrote that the House Democrats' measures for enforcing the new requirement, known as the individual mandate, are overly punitive.


""If you don't buy what the government considers 'acceptable health care coverage,' you’re going to be hit with a tax of at least 2.5% of your income,"" Palin wrote. ""And if you don’t pay that new tax, you could be fined as much as $250,000 and sentenced to up to five years in prison.


""But here’s the thing: they have to make the penalty for opting out very harsh in order to force us to buy coverage. The only way to keep this government run health care plan afloat is for everyone to buy into it – especially young and healthy people. That means that they will have to penalize citizens if we choose not to buy a plan that will cost a minimum of about $15,000 per family per year.""


Palin is correct that the Democratic plan requires everyone to buy insurance or face a tax penalty. The fines and jail terms, though, are not part of the health care bill, but rather the tools the Internal Revenue Service uses against tax cheats. (We ruled on a similar statement about jail terms and fines for those who don't buy health insurance and rated it

Barely True

.)


Here, we wanted to check out whether the plan requires people to buy plans that cost $15,000 per family per year.


Here's how the overall plan for reform works: It largely leaves in place the current system for people who get insurance through work, people who have access to the Veterans Administration, and people on Medicare or Medicaid (government-run health insurance plans for the elderly and the poor, respectively).


The people who will see the most immediate changes under the health bill are those who have to buy insurance on their own, and the uninsured. The House Democratic plan overhauls the rules for insurers who sell to individuals by creating a virtual marketplace called a health insurance exchange. On the exchange, individuals can compare plans and buy coverage. People of modest means will get a tax credit from the government to help them buy a plan. The poorest people will be enrolled in Medicaid.


The $15,000 number that Palin cites comes from a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, a respected, independent federal office that calculates costs associated with pending legislation. The CBO found that in 2016, when the reforms are fully implemented, the annual cost of a basic family policy on the health care exchange will be $15,000.


So when Palin says people will have to buy policies that ""will cost a minimum of about $15,000 per family per year,"" that applies only to people who buy insurance on their own.


For comparison, the average family policy in 2009 for someone who gets insurance through work is $13,375, according to an analysis from the independent Kaiser Family Foundation. The employer typically pays $9,860 of the policy, while the worker pays the remaining $3,515.


People on the exchange will have to pay for the policies on their own, unless they qualify for tax credits to help them buy coverage. The tax credits are on a sliding scale; the House bill says that people who make up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level will qualify for credits. This year, 400 percent of the federal poverty level means $88,200 for a family of four and $43,320 for a single person.


Palin said that under the House health care bill, the government ""will have to penalize citizens if we choose not to buy a plan that will cost a minimum of about $15,000 per family per year."" She's correct that they will be penalized if they don't have insurance. But her statement is misleading in two ways. For many who have health insurance through work, they won't have to pay $15,000 for the family plan because their employer will pay a lot of that. (The average employer would pay about three-fourths, if the current ratio continues.) For people of modest means, the government will give them a tax credit, so it won't cost them the full $15,000, either. The people who will have to pay the full amount will be people who have access to no other insurance and make more than 400 percent of the poverty level. Palin's statement implies that everyone will be forced to buy a family plan that costs them $15,000. In fact, only a small percentage of people would be forced to pay that full amount. So we rate her statement Barely True.

Chain e-mail links supected Fort Hood shooter to Obama
","
Since the shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, on Nov. 5, 2009, we've been inundated with e-mails about a purported link between President Barack Obama's administration and Maj. Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist suspected of the shootings.

 

Here are a few lines from one of the many versions of the e-mail we received:

 

""It’s been a pretty incredible week and I don’t mean in a good way. But today we have been given a glimpse into the New World Order and it’s pretty scary,"" the e-mail begins. After complaining that Obama is pursuing a Muslim agenda, the e-mail says, ""Did you know that Major Hassan was an ADVISOR to the Obama Administration? No? Neither did I until my wife found information on line and followed the evidence to the source documents!""

 

Our friends over at National Public Radio

already checked out

a version of this claim. The rumor, NPR concluded, started with Jerome Corsi, a writer for World Net Daily and author of

The Obama Nation: Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality

. The e-mails we were sent linked to the Corsi story as well.

 

""Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the alleged shooter in yesterday's massacre at Fort Hood, played a homeland security advisory role in President Barack Obama's transition into the White House, according to a key university policy institute document,"" Corsi wrote. (We've checked

three Corsi claims

before and rated two False and one Pants on Fire.)

 

The story links to a document published by the George Washington University Homeland Security Policy Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., titled ""Thinking Anew—Security Priorities for the Next Administration."" It is the proceedings from a series of meetings of the organization's Presidential Task Force. On page 29 of the paper, Hasan is listed as a participant; he was one of more than 300 officials, reporters and Capitol Hill aides who signed up for the conference.

 

In a statement, the think tank confirmed that the Hasan listed as a participant is the same Hasan accused of the Fort Hood shootings. But the statement also makes an important point: Hasan registered for the event on his own. He was not invited, and he attended only as an audience member in his capacity as a psychiatry fellow at the Uniformed Services University School of Medicine.

 

""All of these events were open to the public,"" the statement reads. ""At no time has Nidal Hasan been affiliated with [the Homeland Security Policy Institute] or The George Washington University.""

 

So, Hasan chose to attend a conference relevant to his field, much like a doctor would attend a conference about diabetes, for example.

 

But here's the more important point: The task force has nothing to do with the White House, according to Sharon Cardash, associate director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute.

 

""HSPI's Presidential Transition Task Force is not and was not affiliated at all with the White House,"" she wrote us in an e-mail. ""The Task Force was created prior to the election; and was not formed at the request of any administration.""

 

Indeed, HSPI established the transition task force in April 2008, before Obama was in office, let alone the Democratic presidential nominee. In a city where policy papers are published nearly every day, the work done by the group no more advised the Obama administration than any of the other papers that came out before or after GWU's.

 

Corsi actually makes this point farther down in his story, which contradicts his headline: ""While the GWU task force participants included several members of government, including representatives of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there is no indication in the document that the group played any formal role in the official Obama transition, other than to serve in a university-based advisory capacity.""

 

And in an editor's note to the story, Corsi writes that, ""Hasan is being reported as a participant in the GWU Homeland Security Policy Institute's Presidential Transition Task Force, not as a member, noting the group was a university think-tank, not part of the Obama administration official transition team."" But it appears that disclaimer came later, and that it failed to stop the avalanche of e-mails spreading the inaccurate report.


Hasan attended a meeting on a subject relevant to his profession, that much is clear. But beyond that, there's nothing to back up the chain e-mail's accusation that he somehow was ""an ADVISOR"" to the Obama administration or that GWU's task force was involved in the new White House. In fact, the group's work began long before Obama took office and is in no way affiliated with the White House. Another chain e-mail, another Pants on Fire!

DeGette claims the public option will be privately funded
","
Amid debate over a health reform bill, the House adopted new restrictions on funding abortions, and Democratic congresswoman Diana DeGette is not happy about the development.

 

As chairwoman of the Pro-Choice Caucus, DeGette of Colorado is upset that under the bill low-income individuals would not be able to use federal subsidies to buy abortion coverage through a health insurance exchange. Furthermore, a government-run health insurance option would not offer abortion coverage except in the case of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is endangered.

 

Here's what she had to say about the issue on the Nov. 9, 2009, episode of the

Rachel Maddow Show

on MSNBC.

 

""Nobody in the public option would be able to get an insurance policy that offered abortion coverage,"" she said. ""And we need to remember, the public option is not funded with public money. It's funded with private insurance premiums. So, let's say you have a small business owner who goes in to the public option because they can't get insurance anyplace else, and they want to buy a policy with their own private money, no federal money, that they would be banned from doing that.""

 

We've

already explored

the second part of DeGette's claim, that small businesses and individuals would not be able to buy abortion coverage through the exchange, and found it to be False. In fact, insurers can still offer abortion coverage through the exchange so long as the administrative structure behind it is not supported by federal money, and individuals can buy abortion coverage through the exchange so long as they use their own money.

 

So, for this fact-check, we'll focus on DeGette's other point -- that the public option is funded by private insurance premiums, not public money.

 

The public option has turned out to be the most controversial part of the health care reform. It's a government-run option for people buying insurance on the individual market, not through their employer, and it would be one of many plans offered through a new insurance exchange -- think of it as a one-stop shop for consumers where they can compare costs and benefits between plans. The hope is to increase competition and accountability within the insurance industry.

 

So far, the Senate version of the bill does not include a public option, but Democratic Leader Harry Reid says the bill that comes to the Senate floor will likely include such a plan.

 

The public option has become a flashpoint between Republican opponents of the bill and its Democratic advocates, in part because members of the GOP see it as a government effort to socialize medicine and too expensive. And now that the House has adopted an amendment that officially severed any ties between the public option and abortion coverage, tension between lawmakers on both sides of the abortion debate has only intensified.


DeGette's point is that the public plan isn't really public at all because it will be sustained through premiums paid by consumers, so it should not exclude abortion coverage.

 

We looked into exactly how the public option would be funded, and here's what we found: According to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the plan, the public option would be administered through the Department of Health and Human Services, and it would negotiate rates with providers in the public option. To make sure the public plan doesn't have an unfair advantage, the bill requires that the plan be self-sustaining; funding would come from the premiums consumers pay to get coverage.

 

But the feds aren't exactly off the hook. The government will front the operation $2 billion to cover initial administrative costs and claims, though lawmakers expect that sum will be recouped after the program has been in operation for 10 years.

 

So DeGette is right and she's wrong. In the long-term, the public option is meant to be self-sustaining. But first, it will require a big chunk of of public money to get started. We give her a Half True.

Glenn Beck claims health care bill includes insurance for dogs
","We're months into this health care debate and frankly a lot of the claims we've been fact-checking from opponents and proponents alike have gotten a little stale. So we were thrilled to hear a new one on the Glenn Beck radio program on Nov. 12, 2009: ""Do you know in the health care bill, we're now offering insurance for dogs,"" Beck said. ""Do I need to say any more?"" Actually yes. Keep going. ""If you are somebody who is like, 'Well, I just, I'm struggling and we're barely making ends meet,' I'm not paying for your dog cardiologist!"" Beck said. ""Not gonna do it. I'm sorry, the dog goes nighty night."" There was some discussion between Beck and his executive producer about their own dogs' medical issues, whether or not they have pet insurance, and whether the Obama administration is putting animals on par with humans. Like so many claims in the health care debate, Beck has taken a kernel of something in the bill and spun it to an absurd conclusion. Included in the House bill is the creation of a Public Health Workforce Corps to address shortages in the public health workforce. The program would provide scholarships and education loan repayment assistance for public health professionals serving in areas of need. Veterinarians are included among those public health professionals. ""The rationale is that with mad cow disease, swine flu and other animal-borne diseases and issues, there is logic in helping to create more and better trained individuals to treat animal health,"" said Vincent Morris, spokesman for the House Rules Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y. But the inclusion of veterinarians in the health bill didn't sit well with Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., who noted on the House floor on Nov. 7, 2009, that the loan repayment program will cost $283 million over five years. ""So the real question I have for you folks (Democrats): Why are veterinarians part of this health care bill?"" Stearns asked. Rep. Slaughter responded: ""Have you ever heard of swine flu? Have you ever heard about food safety? Have you ever heard that 70 percent of all of the antibiotics produced in the United States are given to cattle and poultry even though they are not ill? But swine flu should make you worry a little bit, don’t you think?"" The bill also would provide funding for fellowships to support public health training, and again, veterinary medicine is included in the mix. Lastly, the bill would create an advisory committee to assess the health workforce and to make recommendations to ensure that workforce is meeting the nation’s needs. The bill says that would include public health professions ""including veterinarians engaged in public health practice."" In other words, not the local vet who gives your dog heartworm pills. Two other things about the scholarships and loan assistance programs. In order to qualify, the bill says applicants must ""have demonstrated expertise in public health"" and as quid pro quo must serve for a period equal to their scholarship in a public health program assigned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Again, not your pet vet down the street. ""Veterinarians are a part of the public health workforce, especially those that deal with disease outbreak,"" said Brian Cook, press secretary for Pete Stark, D-Calif., chair of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee. ""We have a shortage of veterinarians right now who are trained to deal with disease outbreak."" Still, scholarships, loan assistance and fellowships to veterinarians is one thing. Providing government health insurance to dogs is quite another. ""We are not offering insurance for dogs,"" Morris said. We pored over the bill and came to the same conclusion. There is no health insurance of any kind for dogs -- no public option for Rex, no death panels for Fido. So we've got to put Beck in the doghouse for this one -- Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA34BC0>],/factchecks/2009/nov/12/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-claims-health-care-bill-includes-insura/

Beckel says protest against health care bill drew fewer people than Air and Space Museum
","Counting people at Washington protests has always been a tricky business. Groups have always boasted of huge crowds, but police estimates were often much lower. That sparked such controversy that police don't do the counts anymore.

Without an official police count, organizers are free to claim big numbers, with only the news media to offer an independent assessment.

Such was the case for a protest against the Democratic health care bill on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 5, 2009. The weekday event featured dozens of Republican members of Congress and a boisterious crowd that carried, among other things, a banner showing a photograph of dead Holocaust victims with the label, ""National Socialist Healthcare, Dachau, Germany, 1945.""

As usual, there was debate about the size of the crowd. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., a conservative firebrand who urged her supporters to attend, told Fox News' Sean Hannity on the day of the rally that 20,000 to 45,000 people attended. In the blogosphere, meanwhile, liberals dismissed the idea that more than a few thousand people showed up.

A few days after the rally, Bob Beckel, a Democratic consultant and Fox News contributor, said Bachmann's estimate was inflated. ""Well, I was down at that thing,"" Beckel said on Hannity's Nov. 9 show. ""You said there were 20,000 people there. There were more people at the Air and Space Museum that day than were [at the rally].""

We wondered if Beckel was right, so we checked with the National Air and Space Museum. A spokeswoman told us there were 9,771 visitors that day.

Estimating the size of the rally is more difficult. We called the Capitol Police, which has jurisdiction over the area where the rally was held, and a spokeswoman said that the department did not make a crowd estimate.

So we are left with reports in the news media. A news story in the  Washington Post  put the number at ""an estimated 10,000,"" while Dana Milbank, a columnist with the  Post  , said 5,000.  Politico  , a daily publication that that covers politics, said there were ""at least 10,000"" attendees. Most other newspaper accounts, including stories in the  Los Angeles Times  and the Associated Press, pegged attendance at ""thousands"" of people.

We asked two reporters who covered the event how they came up with their number.  Politico  's Jonathan Allen explained his methodology for us in considerable detail.

""I used a pretty simple method for my estimate,"" Allen told PolitiFact. ""The biggest portion of the crowd on the lawn was penned into a stone-walled area that looks a bit like the top part of a trapezoid. I counted people, roughly ticking off by tens, across the narrow top and got to 180. Then I went down one leg of the wall to count how deep the full line of people went, getting to between 50 and 60. I multiplied 180 by 55, knowing that because I was dealing with an angle greater than 90 degrees at the junction of the walls that my number would actually undercount the people in the space. The product of the two numbers is 9,900. I added because of the shape of the area and because there was another section of the crowd numbering in the low hundreds.""

He concluded that ""it was at least – but not too much more than – 10,000,"" adding, ""I had another reporter with me, who agreed with the methodology. For anyone watching on television, it should be remembered that it’s a huge lawn that takes tens of thousands of people to fill. If it looked empty, that’s because it’s a big space. I’ve been going to sporting events and political rallies for more than 30 years, and I have a pretty good sense of crowd size. That said, if someone can produce an aerial shot and count the people and prove me wrong, I’m happy to correct the error.""

We also talked to Noam Levey, who covered the event for the  Los Angeles Times  . ""We based our estimate on a combination of observation and interviews,"" Levey said. ""Particularly helpful was Clark McPhail, an emeritus professor at the University of Illinois, who has been doing crowd estimates on the Mall for years by calculating densities in set areas of the Mall. At our request, Clark looked at photos of the event to come up with his estimate that about 5,000 people were there.""

We followed up with McPhail. He said that the only elevated photograph of the rally that he was able to secure led him to estimate a crowd of 5,000, but McPhail added that the photograph he used was imperfect. It was not taken from as high an angle as he would have liked, and it was unclear whether it had been taken at the moment of maximum attendance.

When we explained Allen's methodology to McPhail, he praised it as being statistically sound. ""It's absolutely a credible way of counting,"" McPhail said. ""In fact, I train observers to do it that way.""

We find no support for the much larger estimates from Bachmann, who did not respond to our e-mails. And as a leader of the rally, she would benefit from a larger estimate.

So, in the absence of an official count, we'll take McPhail's lead and give Allen's methodology some credence. That means the number of people attending the rally and visiting the Air and Space Museum was about the same. If he's right, it's by just a small margin. If he's wrong, it's also by a small margin. So we find Beckel's claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB642C0>],/factchecks/2009/nov/12/bob-beckel/beckel-says-protest-against-health-care-bill-drew-/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Pundits', 'Rush Limbaugh']","
Limbaugh says health care bill's spending can't be cut in the future
","On his Nov. 10, 2009, show, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh decried President Barack Obama's spending priorities, saying the president is ""worried about 50 measly billion dollars to win a war"" in Afghanistan when he's already spent, or wants to spend, trillions of dollars on other items, such as the economic stimulus package and health care reform.
 
One of Limbaugh's claims caught our eye. He said that the health care legislation ""is going to be mandated spending. You can't cut it, regardless of the budget circumstances."" Limbaugh was trying to make the point that spending demanded in the health care bill would expand without ordinary budgetary limits, and that the health bill's spending would ultimately crowd out other government necessities such as funding the military.
 
To determine whether Limbaugh is right, we'll start by defining ""mandated spending."" Federal budget experts actually use a slightly different term -- ""mandatory spending"" -- but the meaning is the same. It refers to spending that isn't controlled by the usual congressional appropriations process. The spending goes up or down -- usually just up! -- based on the number of people who qualify. Examples include Medicare, Social Security, Medicare and food stamps. Their cost keeps going up as long as the number of people who qualify keeps going up.
 
The health care bill that passed the House and the slightly different one that passed the Senate Finance Committee offer two significant new streams of mandatory spending -- the ""affordability credits"" that subsidize health plans that people buy on the newly created health insurance ""exchanges,"" and an expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor. Both of these efforts, which are broadly intended to help cover previously uninsured Americans, are indeed mandatory spending, health experts said.
 
Under the House bill, people qualify for the credits if they have incomes below 400 percent of the federal poverty level and are not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare. Beginning in year two, credits would be opened up to people whose employer?provided plan would cost more than 12 percent of their income. The Senate Finance bill would provide a credit to individuals with income up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. With either bill as currently written, that would fit the definition of mandatory spending.
 
The second stream of mandatory spending -- an expansion of Medicaid -- also fits the definition of mandatory spending. Currently, Americans can qualify for Medicaid only if their income is low enough and if they are a child, pregnant, elderly, blind, or disabled. Both bills would expand eligibility for the program significantly. So Limbaugh is correct in that the most important new types of spending in the health care bills are mandatory.
 
However, the second half of his statement -- that ""you can't cut it, regardless of the budget"" -- is off the mark. Just because mandatory spending is ""mandatory"" doesn't mean that it's permanent. Congress and the president can act to reduce mandatory spending, or even repeal entire programs, whenever they want.

It's true that doing that is politically difficult. Once people get used to guaranteed benefits (such as Medicare), they usually fight hard to keep them. Politicians, fearing the wrath of highly motivated voters who stand to lose something they value, often back off from challenging mandatory programs.
 
But occasionally, Congress finds the will to cut a mandatory program.

In 1983, Congress agreed to some Social Security cuts that were recommended by a blue-ribbon commission chaired by Alan Greenspan. The cuts withheld cost-of-living adjustments for one quarter and cut benefits over the longer term.
 
And under a major welfare overhaul enacted under President Bill Clinton, benefits were cut for some of those who had previously been entitled to welfare payments, including legal aliens (a bar that was subsequently repealed) and illegal aliens (one that remains in force).
 
Along those lines, the Senate Finance health care bill includes a ""fail-safe"" provision that is supposed to ensure the mandatory spending won't bust the budget. Starting in 2012, the director of the Office of Management and Budget must certify every year that the provisions in the bill will not increase the budget deficit during the coming year. If the OMB director finds that the bill will increase the deficit, the subsidies in the health care exchange would automatically be cut. And that is . . . mandatory.

So while it would be hard to take away mandatory health insurance assistance to lower-income Americans, it's not true to say, as Limbaugh did, that ""you can't cut it, regardless of the budget circumstances."" If Congress and the president have the will, there will be a way.

So Limbaugh is right that the most important spending streams in the House and Senate bills are mandatory. But he's not correct that Congress is powerless to do anything about them. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB6EDC0>],/factchecks/2009/nov/12/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-says-health-care-bills-spending-cant-be-c/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'Loretta Sanchez']","
Abortion votes in the House revealed by Stupak amendment
","
One of the more interesting twists in health care reform came on a recent vote in the House of Representatives on abortion coverage.


An amendment restricting abortion coverage authored by Rep. Bart Stupak, a Democrat from Michigan, won the votes of all Republicans and 64 Democrats to become part of the health care reform bill passed by the House on Saturday. His measure further tightened rules about how insurers could offer abortion coverage, requiring them to offer separate policies in many instances. (Read our

detailed explanation of the Stupak amendment here

.)


Abortion rights advocates should not have been surprised, said Rep. Loretta Sanchez, a Democrat from California, on the MSNBC show

Morning Joe

.


Sanchez, who favors abortion rights, said that ""progressives are really angry"" because they believe poor women should have the choice to get an abortion if they want one.


""On the other hand, we have to acknowledge that the House of Representatives is not a majority prochoice,"" Sanchez said. ""And I've told that to a lot of pro-choice groups. I would count maybe about 150 prochoice votes. You need 218 to get to pass a bill.""


We wanted to know if Sanchez was correct that ""the House of Representatives is not majority prochoice.""


We first turned to an organization that favors abortion rights. NARAL Pro-Choice America rates members of Congress and has compiled its own profile of the current Congress. It labeled 185 members ""prochoice.""


Then we turned to the National Right to Life Committee, a group that opposes abortion. It doesn't rate the entire Congress in the same way, but the group has rated four abortion votes during the current Congress and created percentage ratings for each member. A 100 percent rating means a member fully agreed with the positions of National Right to Life; a 0 percent rating means they did not agree at all.


We crunched the numbers, looking for members who never voted with the position of National Right to Life -- 185, the same as  NARAL's ""prochoice"" members.


Other numbers tend to support Sanchez's conclusion, but they also reveal the complexity of the issue and the fact that every member doesn't fall neatly into a yes-or-no category. NARAL labeled 203 members ""antichoice."" National Right to Life gave only 179 members 100 percent ratings.


NARAL labeled 47 members ""mixed choice,"" while National Right to Life found that 71 members voted with the group some of the time.


So do those numbers add up to the conclusion that there isn't a ""prochoice majority"" in the House?


NARAL spokesman Ted Miller agreed with Sanchez's comments. ""It is accurate to state that antichoice lawmakers outnumber our prochoice allies,"" Miller said in an e-mail interview. ""While the numbers are challenging, we have managed to win some key votes this session (family-planning vote and lifting D.C. abortion ban) by gaining support from some mixed- and even antichoice members.""


National Right to Life spokesman Douglas Johnson, on the other hand, downplayed the idea that antiabortion sentiment is growing in the House. His side does win some votes, he said, and the Stupak amendment was ""the clearest vote on abortion that we've had in the current Congress."" But he doubts that Congress would overturn the U.S. Supreme Court decision

Roe vs. Wade

, a major precedent establishing abortion rights.


""If you had a vote in the House on whether or not to overturn

Roe vs. Wade

, I believe that the majority would affirm that they would support it,"" Johnson said.


In fact, a few members of Congress who voted for the Stupak amendment otherwise receive low ratings from National Right to Life. We counted 34 members who voted with the group on Stupak's amendment but against it on other issues.


Indeed, the Stupak amendment represents a classic gray area: The measure does not forbid insurers from covering abortion, but it requires them to offer separate policies for people who pay for plans with their own money (as opposed to those who pay part of their premiums with government subsidies). Those who favor abortion rights say this will discourage insurers from offering coverage that includes abortion, and perhaps it will. But that's a business decision on the part of the insurers, not a government prohibition. We should add here that the Stupak amendment might not make it to the final bill, once the Senate considers its own version of health care reform.


Getting back to Sanchez's statement: She said, ""the House of Representatives is not a majority prochoice."" Her claim is supported by counts from both sides that show only 185 members are solidly in favor of abortion rights. It's worth noting that the number of antiabortion House members is less than a majority, too. But as for Sanchez's claim, she is right. We rate her claim True.

Hannity says Obama won't even use the term ""war on terrorism""
","
On Sean Hannity's Fox News show on Nov. 9, 2009, the topic was what the government knew about Fort Hood psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army major who authorities say killed 13 people and wounded 30 others.
 
""There is a chance our government knew all about this guy Hasan and did nothing because nobody wanted to be called an Islamaphobe,"" Hannity said.
 
""Now, this is a terrorist act,"" Hannity said. ""What does that say about Barack Obama and our government?""


""Here's the point,"" Hannity said, ""Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism,' because he's apologizing to America in every Muslim country he can.""
 
We've heard a number of conservative radio and talk show hosts criticize President Obama for not using the ""global war on terrorism"" phrase adopted by his predecessor, George W. Bush. And so we decided to check it out.
 
We did a word search of Obama's public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase ""war on terrorism"" as president, though he said it numerous times as a candidate. And early in his presidency, Obama used the phrase ""war on terror,"" but only a couple of times.
 
So what gives? We found two instances where Obama directly addressed the question.
 
The first was during a Jan. 27, 2009, interview by Hisham Melhem with al-Aribiya, an Arabic-language television news station. Melhem noted that Obama seemed to eschew Bush's phrase ""war on terror"" and ""frame it in a different way, specifically against one group called al-Qaida and their collaborators.""



 

Obama: ""I think that you're making a very important point. And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name.


""And so you will, I think, see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al-Qaida -- that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, and we will hunt them down.


""But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship.""

 
The issue was again raised in a Feb. 3, 2009, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper:
 

Cooper: ""I've noticed you don't use the term 'war on terror.' I think I read an article that you've only used it once since inauguration. Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful?""

 

Obama: ""Well, you know, I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations. But that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community. ... You know, words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds.""

 

Cooper: ""So that's not a term you're going to be using much in the future?""

 

Obama: ""You know, what I want to do is make sure that I'm constantly talking about al-Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we, I believe, can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end, and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life.""

 
So Obama isn't fond of the phrase ""war on terror."" But did that ever become blanket White House policy?
 
According to a

Washington Post

story in March, a memo e-mailed to Pentagon staff members from the Defense Department's office of security review said ""this administration prefers to avoid using the term 'Long War' or ""Global War on Terror.' Please use 'Overseas Contingency Operation.' "" According to the memo, the direction came from the White House Office of Management and Budget, which reviews speeches given by administration officials.
 
Kenneth Baer, an OMB spokesman, told the

Washington Post

there was no such guidance, that it was only the opinion of ""a career civil servant.""
 
Still, you don't hear administration officials using the term ""war on terror,"" or the like, very often.
 
Obama was criticized in some circles when he failed to even utter the words ""terror"" or ""terrorism"" in a June 4, 2009, speech in Cairo, Egypt, directed to Muslims around the world.
 
The absence of those words ""goes to the heart"" of Obama's new approach, said John O. Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, who provided perhaps the clearest and most in-depth explanation of the White House lexicon in

a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies

on Aug. 6, 2009.
 
""As many have noted, the president does not describe this as a 'war on terrorism.' ... Instead, as the president has made clear, we are at war with al-Qaida, which attacked us on 9/11 and killed 3,000 people. We are at war with its violent extremist allies who seek to carry on al-Qaida’s murderous agenda. These are the terrorists we will destroy. These are the extremists we will defeat.""
 
Brennan warned that it would be wrong for people to conclude that Obama is not committed to fighting terrorism. ""President Obama has articulated a clear policy — to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida and its allies,"" Brennan said. ""That is our mission, and the president described it in no uncertain terms in his inaugural when he said, 'Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.' And to win this war against al-Qaida, the administration continues to be unrelenting, using every tool in our toolbox and every arrow in our quiver.""
 
Our aim here is not to wade into the war of words over the ""war on terror."" Rather, we just wanted to see if Hannity was right that Obama won't use the term ""war on terrorism."" And except in a couple of instances where he used the phrase ""war on terror,"" Obama has generally employed different words. And it's deliberate, as he has explained on several occasions. Obama provides nuanced explanations for his word choices, and you may agree or disagree with them, but the bottom line is that Obama has chosen not to use the phrase ""war on terrorism."" And so we rate Hannity's statement True.

Hannity says H1N1 vaccines will be given to Gitmo detainees
","The Obama administration's handling of the H1N1 vaccine has given conservatives plenty to complain about. First, the government got behind schedule with its massive vaccination plans. And then came reports that the Pentagon was planning to vaccinate the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Sean Hannity complained of the hypocrisy on his Nov. 2, 2009, show.
 
""So you were hoping to get the H1N1 vaccine,"" he said. ""Well, if the vaccine hasn't reached a doctor's office near you, that might be because it's on its way to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. That's right. A military spokesman announced Gitmo detainees will receive the vaccine sometime this month. That's well before it's expected to be available to the public at large. Seems the Obama administration has its priorities straight. Doesn't it?""
 
Given the confusion over the program -- and a White House denial about the Guantanamo vaccinations -- we decided to look into Hannity's claim.

It all started on Oct. 30, when CNN ran a story quoting Maj. Diana R. Haynie, a spokeswoman for Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay, who said the Pentagon would be offering the H1N1 vaccines to people held at the camp.
 
""Detainees at JTF Guantanamo are considered to be at higher risk and therefore they will be offered the H1N1 vaccination,"" she told CNN. ""JTF Guantanamo conducts safe, humane, legal and transparent care and custody of detainees. As such, we must provide detainees the medical care necessary to maintain their health.""
 
The Associated Press ran  a similar story  on Nov. 2.
 
The news sparked an onslaught of criticism from lawmakers of both parties. They said pregnant women, children and the elderly should have priority access to the limited supply of vaccines over the Guantanamo detainees.
 
On Tuesday, Nov. 3, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said in a press briefing that, ""There is no vaccine in Guantanamo and there's no vaccine on the way to Guantanamo."" But the same day, a Pentagon spokesman said that a shipment of vaccines would eventually be sent to the prison, although he said the detainees would get the vaccine only after it was given to active-duty troops, contractors and others working for the government.  The most recent news reports say that about 300 vaccines arrived at the installation on Monday, Nov. 9. According to the Associated Press, it's unlikely those vaccines will be given to prisoners. Instead, they are meant for military personnel, contractors and U.S. workers at the base. ""We have an obligation to provide for the health of [the detainees], but we're faced with a situation where we have a limited amount of vaccines at this time,"" Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told PolitiFact. Assuming there are enough supplies, the detainees would eventually be given the vaccine, he said. The White House told us that, to date, no prisoners have been vaccinated, but that priority for the vaccine would follow this order: U.S. forces, deployed health care workers (civilian and contractor), civilians, detainees and non-US Defense Department contractors.
 
So, Hannity is correct. Current plans say that the vaccines will eventually be offered to the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. We rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA7DF80>],/factchecks/2009/nov/11/sean-hannity/hannity-says-h1n1-vaccines-will-be-given-gitmo-det/

U.S. Rep. claims Obama told Republicans to 'shut up' and 'go away'
","Back in his Florida district, U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young decided to toss some red meat at the feet of a group of eager Republicans.   Taking the microphone at Monday's meeting of the Pinellas Republican Executive Committee, Young said that President Barack Obama, during a recent campaign rally for a Democratic candidate running in Virginia, told Republicans to ""go away.""   ""He said, 'For those who oppose our policies, you should just shut up and go away,' "" Young said to an overflowing crowd of Republican Party activists and insiders. ""Well, we ain't gonna shut up and we ain't going away.""   When Young relayed Obama's message, some people in the audience gasped.   Could the president have said that?   Almost every word the president utters in public is saved, recorded or typed somewhere. That makes separating truth from fiction when it comes to Obama's public statements pretty easy.   Let's get one part out of the way: After an exhaustive review of transcripts, newspaper stories and videos of Obama's recent campaign speeches, Obama never said the sentence exactly as Young attributed it to him. We did find the speech Young was referring to, however. It was given by Obama on Aug. 6 on behalf of Virginia gubernatorial candidate Creigh Deeds, and was referenced in a  Wall Street Journal  opinion piece written by James Taranto a few days later. At one point while writing about the speech, Taranto describes ""Obama's petulant demand that his critics shut up and get out of the way."" That's pretty much what Young relayed to the crowd of Pinellas Republicans. So we tracked down the transcript from the speech itself. The Virginia speech focused heavily on the economy and the president's support of a $787 billion stimulus package. He joked with the crowd that some Republicans are trying to blame him for the country's economic woes. ""You've got folks on the other side of the aisle pointing at the federal budget and somehow trying to put that at our feet. Well, let's look at the history. When I walked in, we had a $1.3 trillion deficit. That was gift-wrapped and waiting for me when I walked in the Oval Office,"" Obama said. ""Without my policies we'd have an even higher deficit going forward. The one exception is the recovery package that we had to do in order to get this economy moving again."" Obama continued, ""So you can't go out there and charge up the credit card, go on ... shopping sprees on things that didn't grow the economy, hand over the bill to us, and then say, 'Why haven't you paid it off yet?' I got that bill from (Republicans). So we've got some work to do. I don't mind, by the way, being responsible. I expect to be held responsible for these issues because I'm the president. But I don't want the folks who created the mess to do a lot of talking. I want them just to get out of the way so we can clean up the mess. I don't mind cleaning up after them, but don't do a lot of talking. Am I wrong, Virginia?"" The last half of the quote, the ""get out of the way,"" was picked up by the local newspapers covering the speech and spread from there. Conservative commentators like Taranto said it showed Obama's unwillingness to work with Republicans on bipartisan solutions. But the broader context shows that Obama's criticisms were more targeted. Specifically, Obama was criticizing Republicans who blame him for the country's economic problems, when -- he says -- many of the problems were created while Republicans were in power. That's a far cry from Young's report of Obama's statement --  ""For those who oppose our policies, you should just shut up and go away."" Young's statement is much more sweeping and dismissive than anything the president said.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Charlie Crist takes credit for Florida's largest ever tax cut
","
It's become part of Florida Gov. Charlie Crist's firewall when confronted with criticism that he isn't conservative enough.
 
""I signed the largest single tax cut in the history of Florida, a $25 billion tax cut over five years, directed at property tax cuts,"" Crist said while speaking to a group of Michigan Republicans in September. ""My state goes back to 1845; the largest tax cut since 1845 in the Sunshine State.""
 
Crist touts his tax-cutting record over and over, in news releases, political speeches and in the first radio ad for his U.S. Senate campaign.
 
The line is good politics. But is it true?
 
The property tax changes proposed by Crist and the Legislature in early 2007 were sold as the antidote to citizens' complaints that local government spending had spiraled out of control. Crist famously predicted taxes would ""drop like a rock.""
 
On June 21, 2007, the governor signed House bills 1B and 5B — the two-pronged tax package.
 
House Bill 1B required local governments to reduce their property tax rates to 2006 levels and mandated deeper cuts based on how much a local government collected in property tax dollars. The reported savings to taxpayers: $15.6 billion over five years.
 
House Bill 5B, meanwhile, let voters consider further property tax changes. Also known as Amendment 1, the changes — which included an additional homestead benefit, limited property value increases for non-homesteaded property and created portability for Save Our Homes — were approved by voters in January 2008. The savings: $9.3 billion over five years.
 
Combined, that's the $25 billion Crist is talking about.
 
We have to address two questions to see if Crist's claim is right: Are the estimates correct? And do they constitute the largest state tax cut ever?
 
Caution: The following information is considered highly wonky.
 


Crist's tax math


 
To estimate the financial impact of the 2007 and 2008 property tax changes, analysts at the governor's office first forecast a future as if the changes had not occurred.
 
The process was relatively simple. Analysts estimated five years of statewide property tax collection information by multiplying a tax rate, which they did not change, by taxable property values, which they grew at 3 to 5 percent a year.
 
The calculation, analysts said, attempted to replicate the billions of dollars in property taxes Floridians would pay each year if nothing else happened.
 
With that baseline, analysts next built a world post-tax changes, multiplying an estimated new tax rate by the same property values.
 
The difference between Year 1 of the first calculation and Year 1 of the second constitutes the governor's estimate of the savings to Florida taxpayers. They did the same math for years 2 through 5, and voila — $25 billion in savings.
 
Simple?
 
No, says David Gamage, an assistant professor at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in taxation.
 
The governor's estimates would be accurate only if property tax values increased as analysts predicted and local governments failed to reduce their tax rates, Gamage says.
 
We will never know what governments would have done to their tax rates, but we do know about property tax values: They've gone down. Taxable property values dropped 15 percent in 2008, according to figures from county property appraisers. Property values are expected to drop again in 2009.
 
""Even if this policy hadn't been enacted, the future would look different than today,"" Gamage said.
 
It's the same reason that a recent Florida Association of Counties report concluded that of the $1.5 billion trimmed from property tax collections at the county level in the past three years, almost half is a result of falling property values, not the Crist-led changes.
 
When questioned by PolitiFact, the governor's office admitted that its original savings estimates are now likely high and it has not rerun the analysis.
 
What we do know is this: the Department of Revenue said that as a result of the legislative-mandated tax rate rollbacks, the state's property tax collections fell about $300 million (

page 9

) from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2008. And property tax collections in total fell an estimated $745 million (

page 163

) from fiscal year 2008 to 2009, the first year the Amendment 1 changes took effect.
 
That's a $1.05 billion reduction in property taxes. The governor's estimate predicted $6.1 billion in savings during that same period. If property values fail to increase, the gap will only widen since the changes are estimated to have a bigger impact in later years.
 
Part of the difference in the numbers is that the governor's office counted future, theoretical increases in tax collections as part of its estimated ""tax cut.""
 
And part of the difference is that falling property values wrecked the governor's projections.
 


Is it the biggest?



 
Despite inaccurate projections, the governor's office says the 2007 and 2008 tax cuts are still the state's largest.
 
But what else competes? The governor's analysts point to the repeal of the intangibles tax.
 
The intangibles tax — created during the Depression — was paid on investments, and at its peak, sat at 2 mills ($2 for every $1,000). The tax was cut under Gov. Lawton
 
Chiles and repealed entirely in 2006 by Gov. Jeb Bush.
 
At its height in 1999, it provided the state about $1.2 billion in revenue, according to the Department of Revenue. Adjusted for inflation, that translates to about $1.5 billion in 2007.
 
That's a bigger tax break than what the Crist-led changes delivered in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, but not more than Crist's rosy projection.
 
We wondered if anyone previously has claimed to be Florida's tax cut king.
 
Bush did. In 1999, Bush and the Legislature passed what they called ""the largest tax cut in state history."" The $1.01 billion plan included further cuts to the intangibles tax, as well as the repeal of a per-drink tax on alcohol, a rollback in the school property tax rate and a reduction in unemployment taxes businesses pay, among other things.
 
Kurt Wenner, director of Tax Research at Florida TaxWatch, suggested a third tax change that could be considered the state's largest: Save Our Homes.
 
The amendment to the state Constitution proposed and approved by citizens in 1992 limited increases to the property value of homesteaded property in Florida. While there is debate about whether those savings were offset by people without homestead exemptions, the savings to homesteaded property owners is quantifiable.
 
From 1996 to 2008, almost $1.9 trillion in property value went untaxed because of Save Our Homes. Using a conservative tax rate of 17 mills, that equates to $32 billion less in property taxes paid — or about $2.66 billion per year without adjusting for inflation. In 2007, the savings was about $7.27 billion and from 2004 to 2008 the estimated savings was more than $26 billion.
 
Those numbers certainly are bigger than the Crist cuts so far, in reality and in projection.
 
The governor's office said it did not consider Save Our Homes when it made the claim that the Crist tax changes constitute the state's largest. Officials then provided data that showed the saving in the first years of Save Our Homes was modest. But that's because the large savings came in later years as Save Our Homes protected against increases to properties' taxable value.
 
Failing to consider Save Our Homes didn't sit well with Ken Wilkinson, the Lee County property appraiser who led the push for Save Our Homes — and supported the Crist-led changes.
 
""I would say Save Our Homes is the largest tax cut in the history of Florida,"" Wilkinson said. ""There is a savings, you can look it up, and it's real.""
 
Wilkinson and Wenner said you can't ignore Save Our Homes just because it was a citizen initiative. Moreover, the Crist-led changes built off Save Our Homes in two major ways — by making Save Our Homes portable and by creating a Save Our Homes style benefit for commercial and rental properties.
 
If one's a tax cut, so is the other.
 


Our ruling







 
The Crist-led changes to Florida's property tax structure certainly required the lowering of tax rates and assessment values throughout Florida. But there are all kinds of holes in projecting the size and scope of the legislation's impact.
 
Here's the bottom line: While the tax structure changes passed by the Legislature, signed by Crist and approved by voters undoubtedly will result in less property taxes being paid by Florida residents, the specific financial impact of the initiatives remains quite unclear. Experts say projections can be misleading.
 
But given the decline in home values, we know Crist will have difficulty reaching his claim of $25 billion over five years.
 
In the absence of additional data, and with the knowledge that Save Our Homes has cut property tax bills for Florida residents $32 billion or more, we can't agree with Crist that the 2007 and 2008 changes constitute the largest tax cut in state history.
 
We rule Crist's statement False.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Health Care', 'Planned Parenthood']","
Planned Parenthood says Obama promised to ""put reproductive health care at the center"" of health reform
","
With abortion now a key issue in the debate over health care reform, abortion rights supporters are highlighting President Barack Obama's promise about the issue during the presidential campaign.


In an alert to members on Nov. 9, 2009, Planned Parenthood Action Fund said, ""President Obama campaigned on a promise to put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan.""


We'll address that claim here. We'll also be adding it to our Obameter database of campaign promises.


The group's claim is virtually identical to one made in September by House Republican Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, who said in a statement that, ""during his quest for the presidency, now-President Obama declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion, and vowed that this 'right' would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president.""


We researched Boehner's claim and concluded he was right about Obama's promise. We rated the statement

True

.


To explore Obama's promise on abortion coverage in his health care plan, you need to go back to a July 17, 2007, speech he gave to the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. In that speech, he discussed his commitment to how ""reproductive care"" -- a term a campaign aide said included abortion coverage -- would fit into his health care reform plan.


Obama said, ""In my mind, reproductive care is essential care. It is basic care, so it is at the center and at the heart of the plan that I propose. Essentially what we're doing is, we’re going to set up a public plan that all persons and all women can access if they don’t have health insurance. It will be a plan that will provide all essential services, including reproductive services, as well as mental health services and disease management services, because part of our interest is to make sure that we’re putting more money into preventive care.""


The words Obama used in that speech mirror those in the Planned Parenthood Action Fund's recent alert even more closely than they did Boehner's formulation. So it's certainly correct, as the group says, that Obama ""campaigned on a promise to put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan.""


It's worth nothing that since he spoke to that group -- an important constituency for someone seeking the Democratic nomination -- he has chosen his words carefully.


Of all the words Obama has spoken and written about health care reform since 2007 -- a voluminous amount, to be sure -- the terms ""abortion"" and ""reproductive health"" haven't popped up very often. Indeed, on several of the rare occasions in which Obama or his staff have broached the subject, it's been to assure Americans that his health care proposal would not promote abortions.


For instance, in his prime-time address to Congress on Sept. 9, 2009, Obama's only mention of abortion -- which came immediately after he was interrupted by the heckling Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C. -- was that ""one more misunderstanding I want to clear up: Under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.""


That's a reflection of the sensitivity surrounding the issue. Obama's promise to the abortion rights group during the primary campaign could now be a liability before a broader audience that includes many people opposed to abortion rights.


Still, Planned Parenthood is correct that Obama campaigned on a promise that he would put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan."" After all, he was speaking to . . . Planned Parenthood. So we find the group's claim to be True.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Health Care', 'Pundits', 'Glenn Beck']","
Beck claims universal health care is driving Massachusetts' deficit
","On his Nov. 2, 2009, Webcast, Glenn Beck rattled off a list of Republicans he thinks are just too liberal for his party, including Sen. Lindsay ""Grahamnesty,"" Minnesota Gov. Tim ""Cap-and-Trade"" Pawlenty, Sen. John ""My Hero is a Flaming Progressive"" McCain, and Sen. Olympia ""Health Care"" Snowe.
 
And then there's former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who Beck said ""opened the tent and gave you government health care that is now bankrupting the state.""

""That was my problem with the Massachusetts Romneycare,"" Beck said, referring to a three-year-old mandate that requires everyone in the state to have health care. ""I remember saying to him, 'Mitt, you're not king. You're not going to be there forever. You opened the door, the progressives came in.'"" In many ways, the Massachusetts health care model mirrors a plan lawmakers are considering on Capitol Hill, so we wondered whether the mandate could be the budget-buster Beck claims it to be. First, a few words about the Massachusetts plan. When Romney became governor in 2003, he was looking for a way for Massachusetts to make health care cheaper and more accessible.
 
""People who don't have insurance nonetheless receive health care. And it's expensive,"" he told  National Public Radio  in 2006. ""We're spending a billion dollars giving health care to people who don't have insurance. ... And my question was: Could we take that billion dollars and help the poor purchase insurance? Let them pay what they can afford. We'll subsidize what they can't.""
 
Thus began Romney's plan for an individual mandate, a requirement that nearly everyone have health insurance, even those who are unemployed. Though Romney vetoed eight parts of the bill, including a provision that would have fined small businesses that failed to comply with the mandate (the legislature overrode that veto), the basics of his original vision remained intact throughout the legislative process. Commonwealth Care is a program that helps low-income consumers pay for plans while Commonwealth Choice acts as an insurance exchange for individuals and small businesses. The program is subsidized by taxpayer dollars and federal funding. Today, about 96 percent of the state's population has health insurance, either through the state program, their employers or by other means, which ranks Massachusetts first in the nation in terms of percentage of people with some form of coverage.
 
Nevertheless, Commonwealth Care has had its share of criticism. Some critics say it's been a boon to the insurance industry, while others complain that some consumers are paying even more for coverage, not less, as state lawmakers initially hoped. (In fact, Massachusetts has some of the most expensive health care per family in the country, according to some studies.)
 
Another complaint: Commonwealth Care has taken a significant bite out of Massachusetts's bottom line. Indeed, the program has been quite popular. Initially, the state projected that 215,000 people would eventually be enrolled in the program at the cost of $725 million. By 2007, enrollment had reached 80,000 and six months later, the number had doubled to 158,000 people. In 2008, enrollment peaked at more than 177,000 people. Currently, the state is expecting to spend about $880 million on Commonwealth Care in the coming budget year; that's about 3.3 percent of the state's $27 billion budget.
 
So, while the program has become more expensive, it has not been the budget-buster that Beck suggests. We asked experts whether the state would still be facing a $5 billion deficit if the program hadn't been put into place, and the resounding answer was ""yes.""
 
""Beck joins a long and growing list of uninformed commentators who allege that Massachusetts’ health reform is bankrupting the state,"" said Michael J. Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a tax policy think tank. ""He and they are absolutely wrong.""
 
The state's budget deficit has been caused by an unprecedented collapse in state tax revenues, Widmer said.
 
According to the administration, tax revenues have fallen $2 billion below the amounts the fiscal 2009 budget was built upon. And the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, a left-leaning budget think tank, says the problem has been compounded by permanent tax cuts put in place during the late 1990s.
 
Adding to these financial woes is an increase in the number of people relying on unemployment benefits as the result of losing their jobs, said Alan Sager, a professor of health policy and management at Boston University. 
 
""The state would be facing a deficit no matter what,"" Sager said.
 
So, while the state may be broke, it has little to do with the health care program Mitt Romney put in place over three years ago. Instead, tax revenue shortfalls and a growing reliance on unemployment benefits due to layoffs have put a massive budget burden on the state. As a result, we give Beck a False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB99B140>],/factchecks/2009/nov/10/glenn-beck/beck-claims-universal-health-care-driving-massachu/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'Health Care', 'Nita Lowey']","
Lowey says Stupak amendment restricts abortion coverage even for those who pay for their own plan
","
An amendment about abortion coverage was a key reason Democrats were able to narrowly pass the sweeping health care reform bill in the House of Representatives on Nov. 7, 2009. But that same amendment has emerged as a flashpoint that has some Democrats threatening to ultimately oppose the bill.


The question of abortion funding has been a long-running and contentious issue in the current health care debate, and we have already addressed the question in the context of the Senate Finance Committee bill

here

and

here

. Specifically at issue is whether the new system of exchanges and subsidies for uninsured Americans envisioned by the House health care bill would result in federal money being spent on abortion services -- something that has been barred since 1976, with passage of the Hyde Amendment.


The amendment, by Reps. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., and Joe Pitts, R-Pa., has explicit restrictions on abortion coverage that go beyond the language of the original bill.


The amendment passed the House on a 240-194 vote. It won the support of 64 mostly antiabortion Democrats, joining with all Republicans except for Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., who voted present. A wide majority of Democrats opposed the Stupak-Pitts amendment.


Opponents of the amendment argued that it amounted to a severe infringement on rights that have been upheld by the Supreme Court in the landmark case

Roe vs. Wade.

During the House debate, Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., explained that she would support the health care bill despite approval of the abortion amendment, which she strongly opposed.


""Now, this bill is not perfect,"" Lowey said. ""I am deeply disappointed that the House approved language which puts new restrictions on women's access to abortion coverage in the private health insurance market even when they would pay premiums with their own money.""


For this item, we'll explore whether she is correct that it puts new restrictions on abortion coverage in the private market even when women would pay their own premium.


On one issue right off the bat, we believe Lowey is misleading. The Stupak amendment -- which now accounts for about four pages of the nearly 2,000-page bill -- does not address the entire ""private health insurance market."" Rather, it addresses how abortion coverage would be handled within the health insurance ""exchanges"" included in the Democratic-sponsored House health care bill. These exchanges would provide a virtual marketplace for health insurance for those who do not already have coverage through their employer or through a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid.


The exchange is designed for people who are self-employed or work for very small businesses -- but it would serve at most a small fraction of Americans, since most people get their insurance either through their employer, a spouse's employer or through existing government programs. So, by not specifying that she's talking about how abortion coverage would be handled in the exchange, Lowey immediately makes the issue seem to affect many more people than it actually does.


And she makes an additional, and we believe more significant, misrepresentation when she says that abortion coverage would be restricted for beneficiaries ""even when they would pay premiums with their own money.""


The amendment says that individuals buying insurance on the exchange may still purchase coverage that includes abortions as long as no federal money is used. It also says that insurers may still offer abortion coverage as long as such coverage, and the administrative structure behind it, is not supported by federal money, and as long as their insurance offerings on the exchange include two nearly identical options, one of which covers abortion services and one of which does not.


Whether someone would be affected by the restriction depends on whether they receive what the bill calls ""affordability credits"" -- federal subsidies that would help the lower-middle class buy coverage.


People who choose to receive the subsidies would indeed face more significant restrictions on abortion coverage. If they want a plan with abortion coverage, they would have to buy a separate, add-on plan for abortion coverage known as a ""rider,"" using their own money.


But Lowey said the amendment ""puts new restrictions on women's access to abortion coverage in the private health insurance market

even when they would pay premiums with their own money

."" We believe that Lowey's formulation is, at best, misleading. The people who would truly pay all of the premium with their own money -- and who would not use federal subsidies at all -- are not barred in any way from obtaining abortion coverage, even if they obtain their insurance from the federally administered health exchange.


Lowey's office counters that exchange participants who get the subsidies do indeed pay a share of their premiums with their own money, maybe even a majority of the cost. But if that's what Lowey meant, she should have said abortion coverage would be prohibited ""even when they pay part, or most, of their premiums with their own money."" Not making that distinction, combined with her failure to specify that she was discussing only people who use the exchange, suggests that the restrictions are more severe and widespread than they actually are.


Some in the abortion-rights community do actually make a stronger case that the amendment would harm individuals who pay for their coverage without subsidies. This line of argument involves what insurance companies might do from a business perspective in response to the amendment.


Some critics say that the amendment throws up enough obstacles against offering abortion coverage on the health exchange -- particularly the requirement to offer two separate plans, one of them without abortion provisions -- that insurers will simply take the path of least resistance and offer a single plan that leaves out abortion coverage. Some also argue that companies will be reluctant to offer riders for abortion coverage, or that there won't be much demand for them. This could indirectly diminish the abortion coverage options for people on the exchange who don't take subsidies, even though the law doesn't limit their options directly.


There's plenty of room for debate about how the Stupak-Pitts amendment will eventually shape the availability of abortion coverage. But Lowey is wrong on two points. First, she suggests the amendment applies to everyone in the private insurance market when it just applies to those in the health care exchange. Second, her statement that the restrictions would affect women ""even when they would pay premiums with their own money"" is incorrect. In fact, women on the exchange who pay the premiums with their own money will be able to get abortion coverage. So we find her statement False.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Louise Slaughter']","
Slaughter claims that women pay 48 percent more for health insurance than men
","
During a heated weekend debate over the House health care bill, Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York made her case for the overhaul.

 

In part, she said she supports the bill because of how it would improve women's health care.

 

""We will stop telling women ... that they have to pay 48 percent more for health insurance because ... it is all right to do that because women have different diseases,"" said Slaughter, who holds the gavel of the powerful Rules Committee, a panel that sets the parameters for House debate. ""We want to have an end to that.""

 

What Slaughter is talking about is the practice of gender rating; insurance companies routinely charge women higher premiums than men of the same age and health status because, to put it simply, women go to the doctor more often. With policies purchased on the individual market, companies can deny coverage due to pre-existing conditions that are specific to women, such as

being pregnant

; these are practices the House health care bill aims to end.

 

There's plenty of evidence that women pay more for health care. For instance, according to a recent report by the Center for American Progress, women ages 19 to 64 are more likely to spend 10 percent of their income on out-of-pocket health care costs compared to men. During their child-bearing years, women are likely to pay 68 percent more on their health care than men, according to the same report. And a May 2009 study by the Commonwealth Fund found that, in 2007, 45 percent of women accrued medical debt or experienced problems with insurance bills.

 

In short, there's little disagreement that women pay more for health care costs than men do, but do they really pay 48 percent more for insurance? We were hard pressed to find the same statistic that Slaughter mentioned on the House floor.

 

We checked with Slaughter's office and were told that the figure had actually come from a document distributed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office about how health care reform could help women.

 

According to Pelosi's Web site, ""Women are charged up to 48 percent more than men in the individual market. ... These women pay up to 48% more in premium costs than men.""

 

Those numbers were pulled from a recent study by the National Women's Law Center, a group that supports health care reform, that looked at how much women who are 25, 40 and 55 pay for health insurance compared to men, according to Pelosi's office. The group found that women age 25 are charged between 6 and 45 percent more than men for identical insurance coverage. Women at the age of 40 face monthly premiums between 4 and 48 percent higher than men's monthly premiums.

 

As Pelosi's brief pointed out, these numbers have to do with the individual market, meaning the consumer bears the entire cost of the plan. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that approximately 6 percent of all women buy their coverage through the individual market. The 38 percent of women with health insurance through their employer or the 25 percent of women who get insurance through a spouse presumably face much lower costs.

 

So, while Slaughter's underlying point is correct -- that women pay more for health insurance than men do -- she failed to include some important details in her floor speech. For one, she omitted that women can pay as little as 4 percent or as much as 48 percent more in premiums, so she cherry-picked the highest number possible.  Furthermore, Slaughter did not mention that these figures are only for women who buy health insurance through the individual market, which is a relatively small number of consumers compared to women who get insurance through other means. As a result, we give Slaughter a Barely True.
