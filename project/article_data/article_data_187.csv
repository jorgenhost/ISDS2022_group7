Kathleen Ford says private prisons use third-grade data to plan for prison beds
","St. Petersburg, Fla. mayoral candidate Kathleen Ford said recently that among the top issues facing her city is the need for improving graduation rates. Ford offered a disturbing statistic to back up her point. ""We know that our private prison systems are calculating how many new beds (they will need) based on the third grade, number of third-graders, and that’s just wrong,"" said Ford, a former City Council member who is running for mayor for the third time. ""And I think waiting until kids are ready for kindergarten to begin to intervene is too late."" PolitiFact Florida plans on keeping an eye on St. Petersburg’s mayoral candidates ahead of this November’s election and thought Ford’s claim merited more scrutiny. In this case, Ford mangled an oft-repeated, inaccurate talking point about prisons using third-grade reading scores to predict future bed needs. It has been wrongly cited by Hillary Clinton, Colin Powell, and opinion columnists for the Post and New York Times and debunked by FactCheck.org and the Washington Post. Ford went one step further by focusing on private prison operators and the number of third-graders, not academic performance. Her claim is ""nonsense,"" said Peter Leone, a University of Maryland education professor who specializes in behavioral disorders and school discipline. Leone was the director of the National Center on Education, Disability and Juvenile Justice, which during its operation from 1999 to 2006 produced a report touting that ""at least one state"" uses third-grade reading scores to project future prison bed needs. Leone told us the statement was made by a colleague ""before he got the facts."" ""It is an urban legend that politicians like to trot out to claim that either the schools are failing or that we are not tough enough on crime,"" he said. We ran Ford’s words by two of the largest private prison operators in the country, Corrections Corporation of America, a Tennessee company that manages five prison facilities in Florida, and Management and Training Corporation, which manages one prison in Florida. Spokesmen for both companies denied Ford’s claim. Private prisons respond to inmate projections from the state government, so it would not make sense for them to do their own forecasting. ""This is truly the urban myth that will not die,"" said CCA spokesman Steve Owen. Ford directed us to the spring 2012 newsletter of the Nevada Department of Corrections. The newsletter does not speak to her exact point, but it does mention children who do not read on grade level are more likely to dropout, use drugs or end up in prison. So many nonreaders wind up in jail that officials have found they can use the rate of illiteracy to help calculate future prison needs. Indiana’s former governor has stated that determining the number of new prisons to build is based, in part, on the number of second graders not reading at second-grade level. In California they plan how many jail cells they will build in the future by how many children are not reading on grade level by third grade. But neither Indiana nor California does what Nevada claims it does, officials at those states told us. Neither does Nevada. Mike Schmoker, an independent education consultant, made a similar claim in a 1999 Education Week article. He told us he could not verify the claim and does not make it any longer. Mike Tikkanen of Invisible Children, whose website and book use the statistic, said ""no state today admits to it, nor have I been able to find those references."" In Florida, the Office of Economic and Demographic Research estimates future inmate populations through a variety of factors, including historical trends using the state crime rate and the number of arrests and convictions. ""Educational attainment is not one of them,"" said EDR director Amy Baker. Our ruling In making the case for focusing more on education, St. Petersburg mayoral candidate Kathleen Ford said, ""We know that our private prison systems are calculating how many new beds (they will need) based on the third grade, number of third graders, and that’s just wrong."" That’s a spin-off of an urban legend. Some of the largest private prison operators in the country say they get their estimates from the states. And the states tell us that what a third-grader does isn’t a factor. It’s certainly not happening in Florida, which is the only place St. Petersburg’s mayor might have some level of control. This claim needs to be locked up. We rate it Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2013/jul/16/kathleen-ford/kathleen-ford-says-private-prisons-use-third-grade/

AFP ad says premiums will rise under Obamacare
","
The conservative organization that spent more than $33 million in the last election to defeat President Barack Obama and other Democrats has turned its sights to undermining support for the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. The group, Americans for Prosperity, launched a television ad in Ohio and Florida. 
The ad is called ""Questions"" and in it, Julie, a pregnant mother, talks about her concerns about Obamacare. With a backyard swing set in the background, Julie says: 
Two years ago, my son Caleb began having seizures. The medical care he received meant the world to me. Now? I’m paying more attention. 
And I have some questions about Obamacare. 
If we can’t pick our own doctor, how do I know my family’s going to get the care they need? 
And what am I getting in exchange for higher premiums and a smaller paycheck? 
Can I really trust the folks in Washington with my family’s health care? 
In this fact-check, we focus on Julie’s question, ""What am I getting in exchange for higher premiums?"" That line presents higher premiums as a certainty, effectively saying ""premiums will rise."" Whether that’s true in Julie’s case and anyone else’s depends on several key factors: age, income, and perhaps most important, how they get their insurance today. 
PolitiFact is wary of broad claims on the future of premiums under the Affordable Care Act. When House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, said everyone would pay less, we rated that False because some people would see higher rates. 
The ad doesn’t tell us much about Julie except that she already has insurance. We asked Levi Russell, spokesman for Americans for Prosperity, whether her current insurance is through the large-group, small-group, or individual markets. We got no details. Russell said ""Julie’s questions about the impact of Obamacare are universal, which is why we’ve chosen not to get into details on her particular insurance coverage."" 
That would be fine, but if Julie is the Every Woman then her conviction that her premiums will go up is a sweeping statement that needs to be put in the context of the different markets. 
Cori Uccello, senior health fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries, said there are many factors that will shape how people like Julie fare under the Affordable Care Act. The best thing would be if she gets her insurance through a large employer. 
""If they're in the large group market, they wouldn't pay more in premiums,"" Uccello said. 
We contacted the Insurance Commission in Washington state. They run that state’s exchange, the online shopping tool for small-group and individual plans. Stephanie Marquis, a spokeswoman for the commission, said they will post their final rates in about two weeks. If Julie lives in Washington and is insured under a small-group plan, Marquis says she would do pretty well. 
""It’s likely the rates will stay close to the same,"" Marquis said. ""Our essential health benefits that all plans must include are based on benefits already included in most small employer plans. Also, guaranteed issue in the small employer market. People cannot be charged more today, if they’re sick."" 
Employers provide most of the insurance in this country. About 60 percent of everyone under 65 is covered through either a large-group or small-group plan, according to the Employee Benefits Research Institute, an independent think tank. Statistically, if Julie has insurance today, it’s most likely in one of those markets and the ad should not assume that her rates will rise. 
About 22 percent of people under 65 are with a government program, either Medicaid or a children’s program, S-CHIP. The individual market represents the smallest slice of people with insurance, about 7 percent. 
In citing support for the claim that premiums will go up, Russell focused on the individual market. He said rates in California will be 64 to 146 percent higher. We were unable to confirm that. Russell also pointed to a Wall Street Journal article. He said the article covered at length the prospect of ""rising premiums for many Americans."" 
First, we note that in his response, Russell softened the claim in the ad, which assumed that premiums would go up without any qualification. Russell changed that to premiums going up for many people, not everyone. 
The WSJ looked only at the individual market. It used the proposals from insurance companies that want to participate in the exchanges of eight states. 
The WSJ found that, ""Healthy consumers could see insurance rates double or even triple when they look for individual coverage under the federal health law later this year, while the premiums paid by sicker people are set to become more affordable."" 
This could be considered a split decision for the AFP ad. If Julie has a child with a medical history, and buys her insurance with no help from an employer, the article suggests she might do well under Obamacare. On the other hand, if she were young and with a very healthy family, she might pay more. 
This article is one of the first to assess actual rates, as opposed to predicted rates -- studies that amount to informed guesswork. But while better, the analysis is using proposed not final numbers. Some states, such as Oregon, have seen companies lower their rates after they first submitted them. And other studies analyzed similar data but reached different conclusions. 
The consulting group, Avalere Health, looked at proposed rates in nine states and saw middle range plans, so-called Silver tier, that had premiums lower than predicted by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress. Costs varied widely, from $205 a month in Oregon to $413 in Vermont for a 40-year-old nonsmoker. 
The state you live in has a significant effect on how the Affordable Care Act changes rates. In Washington state, Stephanie Marquis said her office was surprised with the numbers insurance companies put on the table. 
""Several carriers predicted rate changes as high as 70 percent,"" Marquis said. ""Yet that’s not what they filed. Many people will pay slightly more or the same for much better coverage."" 
When the Washington Insurance Commission compared those proposals with the rates a private insurance company changes today, it found people in their 20s were paying about $50 more each month, while people in their 40s and 60s were saving $22 to $268 a month. 
Experts have always expected younger workers in the individual market to pay more. The Congressional Budget Office said the price tag for this sort of health insurance plan was likely to go up by 10 to 13 percent. 
However, the CBO noted that a significant number of the people getting their insurance this way would have incomes low enough to qualify for tax credits that would lower the effective cost. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated these tax credits would help about 80 percent of them, although even with that subsidy, many in this group would still see rate hikes. 
The WSJ article did not take the tax credits into account. 
Bob Laszewski, the CEO of the consulting firm Health Policy and Strategies Associate, is pessimistic on rates in the individual market. 
""A family’s costs are much more likely to go up,"" Laszewski said. He said the insurance plans will be better than some offered today and that coupled with other changes will make plans more expensive. On the other hand, he could make no projection for Julie. 
""We don't know anything for sure regarding any specific person. If this person lives in (New Jersey), they might just see their premiums go down,"" Laszewski said. Current law in New Jersey tends to push rates higher, making savings under Obamacare more likely. 
For the most part, uncertainty dominates the picture. ""It is premature to say who will see increases and who will see decreases,"" Cori Uccello with the American Academy of Actuaries said. 
Our ruling 
Americans for Prosperity produced an ad that claimed that health insurance premiums would go up under Obamacare. To make a universal statement, the group both wants us to accept certain details about a woman, Julie, and disregard others. Chief among these is how she gets her insurance today. Statistically, she is most likely to fall into groups that are likely to do well under Obamacare. 
The most detailed supporting document focuses on the group that represents just 7 percent of today’s insurance market. The individual market is the one most likely to see rate hikes but the ACA provides tax credits to cushion the impact of those hikes. 
While most states have yet to announce their final rates, every expert we spoke to agreed that some people will pay more. 
The message a casual viewer would take from the ad is that everyone's rates are going up. But that's not true, based on what experts told us. The AFP ad cherry picks the facts and draws a conclusion beyond what the evidence supports, but it will prove accurate for some people. 
We rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2013/jul/16/americans-prosperity/afp-ad-says-premiums-will-rise-under-obamacare/

Obama cigarette tax idea should go up in smoke, critic says
","
President Barack Obama’s proposal to increase cigarette taxes to help fund pre-kindergarten programs is not getting good grades from some political and business leaders. 
A spokesman for Altria, the parent company of tobacco giant Philip Morris, offered a rationale for his opposition in a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution article. His comments made us curious. 
""We think it is patently unfair to single out adult tobacco consumers with another federal tobacco tax increase to pay for a broad, new government spending program claimed to have benefits for everyone,"" said the spokesman, David Sutton. ""Moreover, excise taxes are regressive, disproportionately burdening middle and lower-income consumers — the very same consumers who have already endured five years of a stagnant economy and high unemployment."" 
It’s frequently said that excise taxes have a great impact on the poor. But as we’ve learned since the Truth-O-Meter started spinning here in 2010 that what’s often said isn’t always correct. We wondered whether Sutton is accurate to claim that excise taxes are ""disproportionately burdening middle and lower-income consumers."" 
Excise taxes are special taxes on the purchase of items such as gasoline, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. They are usually fixed amounts per item, rather than percentages of the price. 
Obama has discussed raising federal taxes on cigarettes by nearly $1 a pack. By some estimates, approximately three of 10 low-income Americans are smokers. 
Some people, like New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, believe raising taxes on cigarettes can discourage smoking. Bloomberg made that argument in 2002 when he tried to increase taxes on cigarettes. 
""You raise it, consumption goes down,"" Bloomberg said, according to a citizen website that opposes what it called ""smoker harassment."" 
Most research we found showed the mayor is generally right, but consumption doesn’t decline as much as anti-smoking advocates would like. The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in one study that a 10 percent increase in cigarette prices is estimated to reduce overall consumption by 4 percent. Other studies say the ratio is more like a 1 percent decrease in consumption for every 1 percent increase in price. 
The CDC report says a larger percentage of low-income smokers quit once prices rise, but that those who decide to continue smoking are disproportionately impacted by increases in excise taxes. 
""Cigarette excise taxes increase the purchase price of cigarettes and can pose a disproportionate economic burden on lower socioeconomic populations,"" the report said. ""However, because low-income groups are more responsive to price increases, increasing the real price of cigarettes can reduce cigarette consumption among low-income smokers by a greater percentage than among higher-income smokers."" 
One group of researchers recently examined this issue in New York, breaking down the lowest income group as those with an annual salary of less than $30,000. The widely reported study, released in September, was funded by the New York State Department of Health. 
The researchers examined the changes from 2003-2004 to 2010-2011 as New York’s cigarette excise tax increased from $1.50 to $4.35. The percentage of income spent on cigarettes for all smokers nearly doubled, from 6.3 percent to 12 percent. For those classified as low-income, it doubled from 11.6 percent to 23.6 percent. 
""Someone making $20,000 or $30,000 who smokes a pack a day is going to spend a much higher proportion of their income than someone who makes a higher salary,"" said the lead researcher, Matthew Farrelly, chief scientist at RTI International, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research institute based in North Carolina. 
But Farrelly, who has written more than 80 research papers on tobacco use since 1998, said the impact for some low-income smokers can be ""non-regressive, or progressive"" when money from these tax increases goes to programs that help some smokers quit. 
Despite the tax increase, the study found that the percentage of low-income smokers who quit lighting up barely declined. But Farrelly said that may be because some smokers are circumventing the higher taxes by buying cigarettes illegally, online or in other states with lower excise taxes. He and his team noted that tax-paid cigarette sales captured only 55 percent of cigarettes sold in New York. 
We wondered whether the negative impact of the higher taxes on low-income smokers is overstated if many of them stop smoking. Farrelly said experts debate that question. He thinks there is still an impact. 
""(The higher taxes) alleviates some of the regressivity,"" Farrelly said, ""but it doesn’t eliminate it."" 
Across the Atlantic, when Germany increased its taxes on cigarettes in December 2004 and September 2005, approximately one of eight smokers went to a neighboring nation to buy their smokes at a cheaper price, a team of researchers found. 
To sum up, Sutton said excise taxes on cigarettes are ""disproportionately burdening middle- and lower-income consumers."" Numerous studies show Sutton’s claim is on target, but a larger percentage of them also quit smoking.

McAuliffe says women earn 77 percent of men's pay for same jobs
","
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe is pledging to increase penalties against Virginia employees who discriminate against women in terms of pay. 
""The gender wage gap is real, and women still earn about 77 cents for every dollar a man earns for working the same job,"" McAuliffe says in a video on his his campaign website. 
McAuliffe, in his statement, became the latest in a growing list of Democrats to mischaracterize an actual figure on the gender wage gap released by the U.S. Census Bureau. Other notables include President Barack Obama and former President Jimmy Carter. 
McAuliffe is wrong to say that the 77-cent figure describes the actual pay difference between men and women ""working the same job."" 
The 77-cent figure compares the median pay of all full time, year-round male and female workers, regardless of occupation. 
Many experts say some of the gap is likely caused by discrimination, but most of it is due to career choices. 
""One of the big factors explaining why women earn less than men is that jobs typically done by women have lower earnings than jobs typically done by men,"" said Ariane Hegewisch, study director at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. 
A 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh concluded that three-fourths of the disparity can be explained by trends common to women: 
they tend to choose occupations that have relatively low wages; 
they tend to have degrees leading to lower-paying occupations than men; 
they tend to have a shorter work history; and 
they take more time off from work for childbirth and child care. 
The American Association for University Women issued a report this year that offered similar explanations for the pay gap, saying it is partly due to ""men’s and women’s choices, especially the choice of college major and the type of job pursued after graduation."" 
""For example, women are more likely than men to go into teaching, and this contributes to the pay gap because teachers tend to be paid less than other college graduates,"" the report said. 
Pamela Coukos, a senior program advisor at the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, said in a July 2012 blog post that ""economists generally attribute about 40 percent of the pay gap to discrimination -- making about 60 percent explained by differences between workers or their jobs."" 
Is there a way to drill down on pay difference for men and women doing the same job? 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles figures on median weekly earnings by men and women with the same occupation. They show that women’s pay lags men in nearly all professions that are measured. For example, women credit counselors and loan officers in 2012 earned 79.1 percent of men. Women accountants and auditors earned 73.8 percent of their male counterparts. Women computer programmers earned 84.2 percent of what men earned in that field. 
But even those broad occupational categories don’t provide an apples-to-apples comparison of people ""working the same job,"" said Karen Kosanovich, an economist with the BLS. 
The BLS, she explained, can look at the weekly earnings of men and women in the general category of ""physicians and surgeons"" -- but that doesn’t  mean they’re the same type of doctor. Within that broad category are general practitioners and cardiologists, department heads and physicians who have just started their careers. 
""We can’t do same-job analysis,"" Kosanovich said. 
A final note: Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for McAuliffe, said his boss got the information for his statement on gender gap pay discrimination from a web post by the National Partnership for Women & Families. That posting, however, does not say the census data compared the pay of men and women doing the same jobs. 
Our ruling 
By saying women earn 77 percent of what men earn for ""working the same job,"" McAuliffe took a valid figure and blew it out of proportion. 
Contrary to McAuliffe’s assertion, the 77-percent figure is not a comparison of the earnings of women doing the same jobs as men. It is a broad comparison of the median annual pay for men and women regardless of occupation. It does not factor in that men tend to chose higher paying professions than women and work more hours.

Hispanic growth in Georgia counties shows need for better outreach, Rove says
","Karl Rove, the chief political strategist behind George W. Bush’s two White House victories, has been telling anyone who’d listen that the Republican Party must do better with nonwhites if it wants to get a Republican back in the Oval Office.   Rove said that at the Georgia GOP’s convention in May, with details about how Republicans have done well among Hispanic voters in Texas by aggressively recruiting Hispanic candidates for office and conducting other outreach efforts.     He offered some statistics to outline the potential trouble for Georgia Republicans if they do not employ a similar approach here.     ""If the GOP leaves nonwhite voters to the Democrats, then its margins in safe congressional districts and red states will dwindle — not overnight, but over years and decades,"" Rowe wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. ""For example, the Hispanic population in Georgia's Gwinnett County increased by 153 percent from 2000 to 2010 while the GOP's presidential vote in the county dropped to 54 percent in 2012 from 63.7 percent in 2000. In Henry County, south of Atlanta, the Hispanic population increased by 339 percent over the same decade. The GOP's presidential vote dropped to 51.2 percent in 2012 from 66.4 percent in 2000. Republicans ignore changes like these at their peril.""     PolitiFact Georgia hadn’t seen such detailed numbers, so we wondered whether Rove was accurate and was there any context missing.     Gwinnett and Henry counties had an explosion in population growth in recent decades.     Gwinnett’s population has increased nearly fivefold since 1980, from 166,903 residents to the 2010 U.S. census estimate of 805,321. Henry, meanwhile, consistently made the Top 10 list of America’s fastest-growing counties in the early 2000s. Henry’s population nearly doubled between 2000 and 2010, from 119,341 to 203,923.   The once-rural counties in the Atlanta area have been reliable Republican terrain in statewide and national elections, and Rove wants it to stay that way.   Hispanics represent a significant portion of the population increase.     The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in March 2011 that Henry County’s Hispanic population had increased by 338 percent between 2000 and 2010, from 2,693 up to 11,813. Gwinnett’s Hispanic population grew from 64,136 in 2000 to 162,035 in 2010, the AJC reported. That’s an increase of nearly 153 percent.     The percentage increases we found were almost the same as what Rove wrote in his op-ed. So far, so good for Rove’s claim.     As for the recent performance of Republican presidential candidates, Rove was on target as well, according to our review of Georgia secretary of state records. In 2000, Bush, the Republican nominee for president, won approximately 64.2 percent of the vote in Gwinnett County. Last year, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney pulled 53.9 percent of Gwinnett voters.     In Henry County, Bush garnered 66.5 percent of the vote in 2000 while Romney won 51.2 percent of the vote in 2012.     Rove implies a correlation between the increase of Hispanic residents in Gwinnett and Henry and the performance of Republican presidential nominees in those counties, even though he doesn’t draw a direct connection.       Most exit polls show about one-third of Hispanic voters nationwide cast their ballots for Bush in 2000, which was considered a good showing for a Republican. Bush courted Hispanic voters by speaking Spanish on the campaign trail in 2000 and distancing himself from GOP immigration positions unpopular among most Hispanics.     The nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center reported Romney did not receive the same level of support in 2012, pulling in about 27 percent of Hispanic voters. Polls showed many Hispanic voters were dismayed by Romney’s position and the Republican Party platform on immigration reform, particularly their stance on tougher border patrols.     If Hispanic voters in the two counties simply liked Bush’s policies better than Romney’s, could that have accounted for the county’s overall decrease in support for the GOP in 2012? Kristin Davison, Rove’s chief of staff, referred us to past comments in which Rove said Republicans can do better with Hispanic voters with the right policies and better messaging.     Census numbers, though, cast doubt on whether Hispanics had enough clout in the two counties to sway the presidential vote outcome.     By 2010, Hispanics formed about a fifth of Gwinnett’s population, up from about 11 percent in 2000. In Henry County, Hispanics made up just under 6 percent of the population in 2010, compared with 2 percent in 2000. But the voting-age population of Hispanics in each county was smaller, and many Hispanic adults weren’t registered to vote.     William Boone, a longtime political science professor at Clark Atlanta University, said the black vote is a critical element that must be considered when examining presidential election voting patterns in Georgia. Boone observed Rove’s lone reference to African-American voters was in the final paragraph of his op-ed.     ""I think what is missing from his equation is the black vote is increasing in Gwinnett, in Henry, in Rockdale (County) and throughout the state,"" said Boone, who noted that black voter turnout is greater than Hispanic voter turnout in Georgia.     Census numbers indicate that the African-American population in the two counties was large enough and active enough at the polls that they could have had a significant influence on the presidential election.     In Gwinnett, African-Americans accounted for almost 24 percent of the population in 2010, up from just over 13 percent in 2000. The number of African-American Gwinnett residents who voted tripled between the 2000 and 2012 elections, state records show.   In Henry, African-Americans made up almost 37 percent of the population in 2010, up from about 15 percent in 2000. In Henry, the increase in those who voted was sixfold, records show.     In 2012, the number of African-Americans who voted in those counties was 15 percent to 20 percent higher than the number of Hispanics who voted, state records show. Georgia did not track how many Hispanics voted in 2000.     Exit polls found Democrat Barack Obama, the nation’s first African-American president, won about 95 percent of the black vote nationwide in 2012. Al Gore, the Democratic Party’s candidate in 2000, won 92 percent of the black vote.     Davison said Rove doesn’t believe that nationwide exit poll results can be applied to specific counties. Still, Davison stressed that Rove’s overall point was that the GOP needs to do better among all racial groups.     ""So, if Republicans rely solely on white voters ... these counties will likely no longer be safe GOP counties as the nonwhite population continues to grow,"" Davison said.     Rove’s numbers were either identical or very close to what our research found. But his emphasis on Hispanic numbers implied a greater influence on the election outcome in the two counties than they brought. African-American voters, who got cursory mention in his remarks,  may have had a larger influence on the performance of GOP presidential candidates in those counties.   That context is necessary to fully consider why GOP candidates did not do as well in Gwinnett and Henry counties.

Barbara Buono claims Newark unemployment is 13 percent
","
In the months leading up to the gubernatorial primary, Chris Christie was busy flying off to various political events around the country, paying little attention to urban blight, soaring property taxes and double-digit unemployment plaguing some New Jersey neighborhoods. 
That’s the suggestion of a new Internet ad released Tuesday by a group called ChristieNotForNJ.com. Buono, a Democratic state senator from Middlesex County, is running against Christie, a Republican, in November’s governor’s race. 
In the ad, Christie is seen campaigning with former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney at a fundraiser in Iowa, followed by a shot of boarded up homes in a blighted neighborhood. 
""Guess what, governor? There’s no fried butter in Newark,"" Buono says in the ad, as a shot from the Iowa State Fair – where fried butter is a staple delicacy – plays in the back. ""Just 13 percent unemployment."" 
We’ll leave the butter assessment for the culinary crowd and look instead at the unemployment claim since New Jersey’s had unusually high unemployment figures even after the recession ended in 2009. But 13 percent for the state’s largest city? It turns out that Newark’s unemployment rate since Christie’s been governor has been quite a bit higher than Buono’s estimate. 
Before looking at unemployment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, let’s note that the data we reviewed was not seasonally adjusted. As a result, BLS spokeswoman Stacey Standish told us it’s best to use the same month to compare data from different years. 
We decided to look at two time frames: February 2010 – Christie’s first full month as governor – to February 2013, and May 2010 to May 2013, the last month for which BLS has unemployment data on Newark. Each time frame allows us to review three years of data. We also looked specifically at the unemployment rate. 
Standish confirmed that our methodology for determining Newark’s unemployment rate was correct. 
First, the February comparisons. 
Newark’s unemployment rate was 15.9 percent in February 2010 and 14.6 percent this past February. For the months in between, the jobless rate seesawed between 14.3 percent and nearly 16.5 percent. 
Now let’s compare May unemployment rates in Newark for 2010 and 2013. 
The rate was 15.1 percent in May 2010. The preliminary rate for this past May is 13.7 percent. 
The only months where unemployment fell to 13 percent during Christie’s entire tenure thus far was in April 2012 (13.8 percent), this past April  (13.2 percent) and May (13.7 percent), according to BLS data. 
Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner and Christie for Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts did not respond to our requests for comment. 
We also looked at unemployment rates in Camden and Trenton – other major New Jersey urban centers with large minority populations -- and found those rates were as high or higher. 
So why has Newark’s unemployment rate been so high? 
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has acknowledged previously to PolitiFact New Jersey that there’s a high rate of unemployment for blacks. Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP’s Washington bureau and senior vice president for advocacy and policy, noted in 2011 that initiatives such as education and more training and employment services could help improve those statistics. 
Our ruling 
Buono said in a new online ad about Christie’s trips to other states, ""Guess what, governor? There’s no fried butter in Newark. Just 13 percent unemployment."" 
Data from the BLS shows that for almost all of Christie’s tenure as governor, Newark’s unemployment rate has been at least a full percentage point or two higher than what Buono’s ad claims. There have only been three months in which the city’s unemployment rate was in the 13 percent range: April 2012, April 2013 and a preliminary rate in that range for May. 
The point of Buono’s claim is that Newark has had consistently high unemployment, whether during the few months it was in the 13 percent range or when it stagnated in the 15 percent range. We rate her claim True.

Rep. Patricia Morgan says 9 percent of Rhode Island workers use temporary disability insurance each year versus just 3 percent of workers in New Jersey
","
Earlier this month, the General Assembly passed legislation intended to expand Rhode Island's temporary disability insurance program to allow up to four weeks of paid leave per year for workers caring for a seriously ill parent, child, grandparent or spouse or to bond with a new child. The bill, H-5889, will cover the costs by increasing the amount of money that is already taken out of each worker's paycheck for TDI. 
Gov. Lincoln Chafee signed the bill into law July 11, 2013. 
For the uninitiated, the state TDI program, pioneered in 1942 and the first of its kind in the United States, pays workers a portion of their lost income if they get sick for any reason. 
It is separate from worker's compensation, which pays workers if they are injured on the job. 
One opponent of the expansion plan was Rep. Patricia Morgan, a Republican from West Warwick. ""There are only five states right now that mandate TDI. We're one of them. And we overuse it,"" she said. ""I don't think we're an unhealthy place to live, but New Jersey, which also mandates TDI, only has 3 percent of their employees use the program in a year's time. Here in Rhode Island we have 9 percent. Something is out of whack."" 
She also reported that ""those 9 percent are using it an average of 11.4 weeks. You can only take 12 [weeks] so clearly people are kind of pushing it to the very end. We need to do a study first on why we overuse TDI before we start expanding it."" 
Are Rhode Islanders really using TDI at a rate that's three time higher than New Jersey? We decided to check the numbers. 
Morgan said she got her data from Ken Block, head of Rhode Island's Moderate Party and candidate for governor, who made a presentation on TDI costs earlier this year. She sent us a copy of a slide titled ""Usage of TDI in Rhode Island versus New Jersey"" that he used in a presentation. 
In his presentation, Block said that, based on the 2011 annual report from the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training (RIDLT) , 35,836 out of Rhode Island’s 393,000 wage earners received TDI payments that year. That's 9.1 percent. 
But RIDLT spokeswoman Laura Hart cautioned that the 35,836 number is misleading. That's the number of claims filed each year, but it includes repeat claims from people who became sick more than once that year. 
To get closer to the number of individuals using the system, you have to look at the number of first claims for the year, also known as ""new claims."" (That statistic is not listed in the annual report.) That number for 2011 was 30,953. 
""If you divide that by the total universe of covered employees in 2011 (393,300), you get 7.9 percent,"" not 9.1 percent, she said in an e-mail. (The rate in 2012: 7.7 percent.) 
We also checked Block's figures for New Jersey. 
He said 3.77 percent of people covered by the TDI program there use the insurance each year. Once again, looking only at new claims, Block’s percentage was off, but only a bit -- the rate was 3.72 percent, according to data in the 2011 annual report by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. (Block gets other numbers wrong -- it's 101,627 claims, not 132,193 and 2.7 million workers were covered, not 3.5 million; but the percentage turns out to be comparable.) 
In short, Rhode Islanders use TDI at twice the rate of New Jersey, not three times more as Morgan indicated. 
Hart said it's difficult to accurately make a comparison. ""RI and NJ run different TDI programs. Not only are they financed differently, but they don't cover the same universes. RI TDI is mandatory for all private sector employees. NJ, on the other hand, gives employers the option to offer state coverage or to buy private coverage. To get a true apple-to-apple participation rate for all private sector employees in NJ, you would have to include participation and coverage data for those with private coverage too."" 
In addition, the rules for each state program are different. In New Jersey, for example, a government employee isn't eligible for disability benefits until all sick leave has been exhausted. 
And what about other states? 
We tried to get comparable rates of utilization for California, New York and Hawaii, the other states with TDI coverage, but we couldn't find a quick source for comparable information. So we'll leave it to others to determine whether Rhode Island is really out of line and, if so, why.   
Two more things. 
First, Morgan was off a bit when she said people who take TDI in Rhode Island are using it for an average of 11.4 weeks. The average duration was actually 11.2 weeks. In New Jersey, it's 10.1 weeks. 
More important, she was wrong to suggest in her comment that 11.4 weeks is close to a limit of 12 weeks. That's not the limit. It's up to 30 weeks per 12-month period, beginning when the person makes a claim. The actual allowed duration depends on the person's medically-certified health problem. 
  
Our ruling 
Rep. Patricia Morgan said that in Rhode Island, 9 percent of employees use TDI each year while in New Jersey, which also mandates TDI, the rate is only 3 percent. 
The actual rates are closer to 8 percent in Rhode Island and 4 percent in New Jersey. 
But New Jersey’s figures include only workers who receive state coverage, not private coverage. We don’t know how that would affect the usage rate there, but neither does Morgan. 
Because Morgan’s figures are so far off, the judges rate her statement Mostly False.

Is the likely 911 response time in Curry County one hour?
","On the final day of the 2013 Oregon Legislature, lawmakers approved a bill that will allow Gov. John Kitzhaber and leaders to declare a public safety state of emergency in certain rural counties hit hard by the expiration of federal timber payments. A state takeover is certainly a radical idea. A state takeover that also imposes temporary taxes to help pay for the state takeover is a radical and horrifying idea for voters of this tax-shy county. The governor stepped up his efforts to pass House Bill 3453 after voters in Curry and Josephine counties rejected tax measures in May. Sen. Jeff Kruse, R-Roseburg, dislikes the bill but voted for it, noting on the Senate floor that the situation is dire in Curry County. ""Currently if you make a 911 call you’re likely to wait for an hour for a response. That’s the reality,"" he said. Is that true? Is that the wait time for a response to a 911 call in Curry County? We called the Curry County Sheriff’s Office, figuring Sheriff John Bishop would know. The executive assistant, Lisa Combs, said that an hour wait is not the norm. But they’re down to four road deputies -- plus two deputies dedicated to marine calls -- to cover 1,648 square miles. ""Cold calls sometimes do take a long time,"" Combs said. ""We try to respond to high priority in-progress type calls but again, they’re not on 24-7. If we have to call someone in the middle of the night, it takes time."" ""Some calls, we’re there in two minutes or in five minutes, but if we only have four deputies and I’ve got one on and"" he’s in one side of the county and the call’s from the other side, it will take awhile, she said. In May, Curry voters rejected a $4.5 million five-year property tax increase that would have boosted the numbers from four deputies to 12, allowing them to be positioned at both ends of the county. Curry residents pay the second lowest effective tax rate in Oregon, according to 2012-13 state figures and the second lowest permanent tax rate as of 2010-11. David Brock Smith, chairman of the Curry County Board of Commissioners, said the county had more than a dozen deputies on patrol a decade or so ago. The failed tax increase would have paid for two deputies to be on patrol 24 hours a day, seven days a week, he said. ""So in any given time the maximum would be less than 30 minutes"" response time, he said. Cities within the county have police but they are limited to calls within city limits, and they don’t provide around the clock patrol either. Nearby Josephine County has it bad as well. In May, National Public Radio aired a story about a woman’s harrowing 911 call to Josephine County dispatchers, in August 2012. The terrified woman reported that her ex-boyfriend was trying to break into her house. He had put her in the hospital before. But it was 5 a.m. Saturday, and deputies were not available. The call transferred to Oregon State Police, also unavailable. The ex-boyfriend pried open the front door and attacked the caller. We checked in with Kruse. He said it was not his intent to convey that an hour wait is the norm in Curry County. ""It’s not always the case, but potentially, it could be,"" he said. ""There are times when there’s nobody on patrol. They just don’t have the manpower."" The drive between Brookings in the south and Port Orford in the north takes about an hour, according to Mapquest. If a deputy is occupied in the south and a call comes in from the north, yes, the response time could take an hour, or more. We did circle back to the Curry County Sheriff’s Office to ask if there are average response times for when a deputy is dispatched. ""I couldn’t even begin to tell you,"" Combs said. So, we don’t have a breakdown of response times for 911 calls, which means we can’t tell you how the hour wait compares with any sort of norm. Kruse’s use of the word ""likely"" could be taken by some listeners to mean ""more likely than not,"" and there’s no evidence to suggest that is the case. Sometimes the response time in Curry County is better and sometimes it is worse, making the statement partially accurate. Response times can range from mere minutes to the next day of business, depending on the details of the call.   We find his statement is missing important details and rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2013/jul/13/jeff-kruse/likely-911-response-time-curry-county-one-hour/

Judicial Watch says Department of Justice unit organized protests against George Zimmerman
","
  
To the right-leaning crowd, it’s the latest blight against the Obama administration. 
Citing a public records haul, Judicial Watch says the Justice Department’s ""Community Relations Service"" responded to escalating racial tension in Sanford, Fla., following Trayvon Martin’s shooting death by helping ""organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman,"" his shooter. 
Sanford police did not arrest Zimmerman because he said he was acting in self defense, churning outrage among the African-American community and national civil rights leaders. But two months later, a special prosecutor appointed by Gov. Rick Scott announced second-degree murder charges against Zimmerman. His trial on those charges was this week, and a verdict is expected soon. 
Amid the trial, Judicial Watch released the results of federal and state public-information requests it received regarding CRS involvement in Sanford. 
CRS workers applied for various reimbursements for working in Sanford from March 25-April 12, 2012, Judicial Watch announced July 10, 2013. The group said it obtained the information from a Freedom of Information Act request filed around that time. 
In a separate ""investigative bulletin"" post touting the findings, the group went further, saying the ""group actively worked to foment unrest, spending thousands of taxpayer dollars on travel and hotel rooms to train protesters throughout Florida."" 
""These documents detail the extraordinary intervention by the Justice Department in the pressure campaign leading to the prosecution of George Zimmerman,"" president Tom Fitton states in a news release. ""My guess is that most Americans would rightly object to taxpayers paying government employees to help organize racially-charged demonstrations."" 
The news sparked outrage among conservative sites, including the Heritage Foundation and The Daily Caller, and attracted mainstream attention at CNN. The Rush Limbaugh Show went with the headline ""Obama Regime Organized Trayvon Protests."" 
We wanted to take a closer look. Did the Justice Department team really organize rallies against Zimmerman? 
The Community Relations Service bills itself as the Justice Department’s ""peacemaker,"" established in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and intended to resolve local conflicts grounded in race. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act in 2009 broadened the agency’s charge to include unrest dealing with sexual orientation, religious bigotry or disability. CRS requested a $12 million budget for 61 positions for the 2012-13 fiscal year. 
Responding to hate crimes and police-community relations typically dominate the agency’s work, according to annual reports. After the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, CRS employees responded to attacks against Muslim and Arab-American communities. Some of the ways the unit works to calm potential riots is by sending its employees to help officials or volunteers manage tense situations when police use force against citizens or when there are major demonstrations or school disruptions, according to the agency’s website. Sometimes they draw up mediation agreements to help parties move forward. 
News accounts portray CRS employees responding to trouble as inconspicuous, secretive bystanders. They’re not part of the chaos, but quietly monitoring it (usually in navy blue windbreakers, dark sunglasses and caps embroidered with the DOJ logo, according to the Orlando Sentinel). 
Judicial Watch includes links to travel vouchers it received as part of its FOIA request to build the case that the DOJ team helped organize anti-Zimmerman rallies. The vouchers do not include much information beyond travel and lodging expenses, the date and location of the trip, and a short description of the purpose. The employee’s name is among redacted information. 
In an interview, Fitton said the voucher costs seem reasonable, but his group still objects to public funds being used to deploy the CRS to Sanford in connection with the protests. 
Here’s a sampling: 
""On March 25-27, 2012, CRS deployed to Sanford, FL to work marches, demonstrations and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African American teen by a neighborhood watch captain."" Amount paid to voucher: $674.14. 
A similar itinerary for March 30-April 1, 2012, says, ""CRS was in Sanford, FL to provide technical assistance to the City of Sanford, event organizers, and law enforcement agencies for the march and rally on March 31."" Voucher cost: $751.60. 
CRS went to Altamonte Springs on March 30-April 1, 2012, ""to provide interregional support for protest deployment in Florida."" Total voucher: $751.60. 
""On April 3-12, 2012, CRS was in Sanford, FL to provide technical assistance, conciliation, and onsite mediation during demonstrations planned in Sanford."" Total voucher: $1,307.40. 
The CRS was contacted by a senior project manager for the city of Sanford as community dissent reared up, according to news reports. 
A key player in the Sanford controversy is Thomas Battles, the CRS southeastern regional director who has acted as a neutral party in dicey racial issues for three decades, including the Elián González custody case. He does not talk to the media, per CRS policy, but his work has not gone unnoticed. The mayor of Sanford called him ""a voice of reason"" in the tumultuous weeks following Martin’s death, according to a Miami Herald profile of Battles. 
Battles did not organize protests, as Judicial Watch claims. His team did meet with organizers and city officials to make sure protests happened peacefully, news stories show, and he helped the city draft a nine-point plan aiming to foster better communications between police and residents. 
As Judicial Watch points this out, Florida newspapers report he also secured police protection for a group of students who marched 40 miles from Daytona to Sanford over three days. The student group staged a sit-in in front of the Sanford police department’s doors, causing it to shut down for the day. Fitton said helping them get there was inappropriate. 
Battles also organized a league of local pastors, known as Sanford Pastors Connecting, to help the community move on regardless of the verdict in Zimmerman’s case. 
Fitton said he remains convinced the Department of Justice unit went too far in siding with the Zimmerman protesters. He pointed to a local pastor’s comments in the Orlando Sentinel about the peacekeepers, saying, ""They were there for us,"" and ""We felt protected."" 
But the point of the program was to take steps to avoid exacerbated confrontation that could have cost the taxpayer even more money in the long run, said Robin Davis, director of the University of Florida’s Institute for Dispute Resolution. 
""I don’t think there’s any cause and effect between this mediation and the prosecution going forth,"" she said. 
Our ruling 
Armed with public documents, Judicial Watch said the Department of Justice sent the Community Relations Service to Sanford in the wake of Martin’s death ""to help organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman."" 
Judicial Watch’s statement contends an element of truth: Justice Department employees were sent to Sanford, in part to deal with community uprising, including protests. But they were sent with the idea of keeping the situation peaceful and calm, not to instigate or condone protests or violence. 
That’s a critical distinction being ignored in this particular claim. We rate it Mostly False.\

If abortion measure passes El Pasoans will suffer long drive for cervical cancer screening
","The Texas Democratic Party sent out an email blast July 3, 2013, seeking signatures on a petition calling (ultimately without success) for hearings to be held around the state on a legislative measure tightening restrictions on abortion in Texas. Signed by party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa, the letter said, ""If this bill passes, someone living in El Paso would have to drive 550 miles each way to San Antonio for something as simple as cervical cancer screening at a clinic."" House Bill 2, which a House committee approved the day Hinojosa’s email went out and was awaiting Senate consideration as we posted this article, would ban most abortions after 20 weeks and toughen standards for abortion clinics. Opponents have said a provision that clinics must upgrade to the standards of ambulatory surgical centers could lead 36 of 42 clinics that perform most Texas abortions to shut down. When we contacted the Democratic Party about Hinojosa’s claim, spokeswoman Tanene Allison told us by email that although the chairman’s San Antonio reference could be read as saying no El Paso facility would continue to provide such services, it was not intended that way. Hinojosa ""does recognize that there may be other clinics open for these screenings in El Paso,"" Allison said. ""Our intention was to say that if you go to the clinics that are covered under HB2, you would have to drive 550 miles to get some of the services that you normally get locally,"" Allison said. ""We certainly could have been clearer and will be in future emails."" Still, we checked on conditions in El Paso for ourselves. El Paso, a city with 672,538 residents as of 2012, is at Texas’ western edge, but it’s not isolated. It’s across the Rio Grande from the more than 1 million residents of Mexico’s Ciudad Juárez, and inside the U.S., it’s closer to Albuquerque, N.M. (population 555,417) and the nation’s sixth-largest city (Phoenix, population 1.5 million) than it is to San Antonio. Two El Paso clinics could shutter if the measure becomes law, according to a July 10, 2013, El Paso Times news story. The clinics appear on a Department of State Health Services list of abortion facilities we received by email June 25, 2013. Reproductive Services of El Paso, near downtown, provides cancer screenings and other services, while Hill Top Women’s Reproductive Clinic solely offers abortions and pregnancy tests, according to the clinics’ websites. We called both clinics, but did not hear back. So, if Reproductive Services were to shut down, would El Paso women have to drive 550 miles to get a test for cervical cancer? ""That’s unbelievable. That’s not possible. I don’t even know where to start,"" said Adriana Valdes, co-director of outreach and case management at the Cancer and Chronic Disease Consortium, which manages El Paso clinics’ participation in the state’s Breast and Cervical Cancer Services program. ""There are a lot of organizations and institutions here that can provide access to those services,"" Valdes told us by phone. Lawmakers ""need to put all the facts together"" before making decisions that could affect funding for women’s health ""coming into needy communities like ours,"" she said. ""Many towns and hospitals are committing their monies to diagnostic screenings and diagnostic services and none of them are providing abortion services."" Valdes said she was not aware of the two clinics listed as abortion facilities, but said that any time a facility closes, it has a big impact on the women in the area who rely on its services. ""We have central locations,"" she said. ""Those are not long distances."" Access to transportation is a concern, she said, but the biggest issue can be making sure women know the services are available, especially with patients who get used to going to a single facility for years and don’t know of other options. Education and advice for such women is a main function of her organization, which subcontracts with 12 to 14 clinics and some private health care providers to help women get breast and cervical cancer screenings at low or no cost, Valdes said, and gives ongoing assistance to women diagnosed with cancer. The clinics do not provide abortions, she said, and so would not be directly affected by the legislation, although it could mean more women would seek their ""already overwhelmed"" services. Access to cervical cancer screenings in El Paso decreased when Planned Parenthood clinics in El Paso closed, we learned from Valdes and Theresa Byrd, a professor at Texas Tech University’s Paul L. Foster School of Medicine in El Paso. According to the 2013 El Paso Times news story and another from June 27, 2009, all six Planned Parenthood clinics in El Paso closed in 2009 because of financial problems. Byrd, who helped develop a intervention program being tested now in El Paso and other cities to increase the prevalence of cervical cancer screenings among Mexican American women, told us that if the abortion measure became law, ""the situation would stay about the same"" in El Paso regarding cervical cancer screening. That is, such tests would still be available. Byrd said, ""In El Paso, is it easy to get service? No. You might have to wait, and it’s probably not as easy as it would be in other communities"" such as Houston. ""But can you get them? Yes."" For women who have health insurance, Byrd said, the path starts with a visit to the obstetrician/gynecologist or family doctor. ""So many women in our community are uninsured that many of them use our federally qualified health centers,"" she said, naming El Paso’s three major providers in the state program: Centro San Vicente, Project Vida and Centro de Salud Familiar La Fe. Three or more health fairs held each year in El Paso also offer screenings, Byrd said, and cervical cancer tests are available in Juárez as well. Among health care options in El Paso is University Medical Center, which according to an online fact sheet is the largest public hospital on the U.S./Mexico border. Spokesman Jethro Armijo told us by phone that the hospital has seven outpatient clinics offering women’s health care including cervical cancer screenings. The clinics do not offer abortions and are located throughout the county, he said. Our ruling Hinojosa said that if the abortion legislation passed, an El Paso resident would have to make a 550-mile trip to San Antonio for simple services like a cervical cancer screening. That’s not so; such services will continue to be available in El Paso, local experts say. This statement misses the mark so badly, it’s ridiculous.

Sen. Robert Menendez says Obamacare’s employer mandate affects 1% of U.S. workforce
","
Just how many workers does the health care law’s employer mandate affect, anyway? 
The Obama administration’s holiday-week announcement that it would delay requiring large employers to provide full-time employees with affordable coverage inflamed opponents of the law. (And dismayed some supporters, who questioned whether the president had that authority.) 
But some pointed out that, in any case, the mandate wouldn’t affect many folks. 
Take Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., on NBC’s Meet the Press on July 7: 
""96 percent of all companies in America weren't subject to the mandate because they're under 50 employees. Those who are subject to the mandate, 95 percent of them already offer insurance so, we're talking about probably 1 percent of the American workforce that works for a company subject to the mandate that didn't get insurance and will be able to get it in the health exchanges that open up in October."" 
Are we talking about just 1 percent of the American workforce? 
Employers, employees 
We asked Menendez’s office for evidence for his claim. 
A spokeswoman pointed us to a respected employer survey and two opinion pieces. 
It turns out that ""1 percent of the American workforce"" is a ballpark calculation based on survey research on the number of employees who work for large firms that don’t offer insurance. 
Several prominent health economists we spoke with think that’s a pretty reasonable way to estimate it. But some others think it may understate the reach of the mandate by millions. 
But no one’s sure just how many million. Let us explain. 
Here’s how the mandate works: Starting in 2014 — now 2015 — employers with more than 50 full-time equivalent employees must offer affordable health coverage. If they don’t offer coverage, or offer coverage that’s too limited or too expensive, they’ll likely end up on the hook for penalties (the government’s calling them ""shared responsibility payments"") of about $2,000 per full-time employee, excluding the first 30. 
For the visual learners among you, the independent nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation summarized the mandate in this nifty infographic. 
The employer mandate’s supposed to work hand-in-hand with the individual mandate that everybody — with a few exceptions — carry health insurance or pay a tax penalty. If employers don’t offer coverage, their workers may seek it out on new insurance exchanges, where they may be eligible for tax credits. 
The employer penalties are designed to discourage dumping employees onto the exchanges, where they may drive up the cost of government subsidies. Or, barring that, to offset the cost of those subsidies. (The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in May, before the delay, that the penalties would be worth $10 billion in 2015.) 
But Menendez argued on Meet the Press that because the mandate applies only to larger companies, most of whom already offer insurance, the number of workers who would have been affected just isn’t all that big. More specifically: about 1 percent of the American workforce. 
Let’s talk about that calculation for a second. 
The size of the U.S. labor force, according to the government, is about 156 million. 
Menendez’s sources estimated the mandate only affects about 1 million or 1.5 million workers — about 1 percent of 156 million. 
They focused only on the likely number of employees who work for the 5 percent of large firms that don’t offer insurance, based on a widely respected employer survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
We know because we talked to them: Zeke Emanuel, a bioethicist, and Mark Duggan, a health economist, both scholars at the University of Pennsylvania who have advised the Obama administration. (Emanuel also happens to be the brother of Rahm, the president’s former chief of staff, now mayor of Chicago.) 
It’s hard to estimate exactly, Duggan said, but if the perhaps 10,000 to 12,000 companies that don’t offer insurance each have about 80 to 100 employees — there you go. It’s in the range of Menendez’s 1 percent. 
It’s reasonable to assume that most of the companies with more than 50 employees that don’t offer insurance are on the small side, they say, because the Kaiser research shows the larger the size of the firm, the more likely it is to offer insurance. 
Kaiser itself concludes that in 2012, 95 percent of employers with at least 50 workers offered insurance — and among firms of that size, 98 percent of employees worked for a company that offered coverage to at least some of its workers. 
Here’s the criticism: What about the uninsured workers who work for companies that offer insurance? 
Duggan and Emanuel (and others, including Romneycare/Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber at MIT) say most of those folks wouldn’t trigger the mandate, anyway: They’re part-time or temporary workers that companies won’t be required to insure. 
Other health economists we spoke with said: Not so fast. How do you know? 
Christopher Conover, who works for the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University, argues there are millions of uninsured workers who work for companies that offer insurance who may well qualify for employer coverage under Obamacare. 
He pointed to a recent example in the New York Times of a restaurant that would likely be subject to the employer mandate. The owner offers health coverage to employees, but only to nine of them. It’s a company, then, that offers insurance — and so wouldn’t be part of Duggan’s ballpark calculation. 
But under the employer mandate, the restaurant owner estimates he would need to insure 22 of his 85 employees. Conover argues any estimate of the number of workers affected by the mandate should include workers like the 13 restaurant employees who are right now left out. 
They work for a company that offers health insurance, but not to them. 
Here’s the thing: Economists disagree about how common that situation really is. Are there a million such workers? Five million? More? 
They don’t know. 
""It’s a lot more than a million people. It just has to be,"" said Stephen Parente, a health economist at the University of Minnesota who advised Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. 
Still, experts we talked to agreed that the vast majority of the American workforce are not affected. 
""I think the bottom line is that it is small,"" said Gruber of MIT. ""Menendez may not be exactly right but he is in the right ballpark."" 
Our ruling 
Menendez said on Meet the Press that ""we're talking about probably 1 percent of the American workforce that works for a company subject to the mandate that didn't get insurance."" He cited a ballpark estimate by health economists based on the small number of large employers who don’t offer insurance. 
Critics of the estimate say that calculation misses uninsured workers for the 95 percent of large employers that do offer insurance. The problem is that no one’s sure how many of those workers would be subject to the mandate — as opposed to part-time or temporary workers who don’t qualify for employer insurance now, and wouldn’t in 2015, either. 
But that number, even if it's millions more, remains a small percentage of the U.S. workforce. We rate Menendez's claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/jul/12/robert-menendez/sen-robert-menendez-says-obamacares-employer-manda/

During a recent rally on the state capitol grounds, opponents of Medicaid expansion argued it is ridiculous to expand a health care program that they said is fundamentally flawed. 
Among the speakers was Dave Schwartz, Virginia director for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group that organized the rally. He said Medicaid patients receive poor health care, in part because many doctors are unwilling to treat them. 
""Twenty-four percent of doctors in Virginia currently don’t accept new Medicaid patients because the reimbursement rates are so low,"" he said. 
 We wondered whether Schwartz’s statement about Virginia physicians is correct. It’s an intriguing claim because if expansion is approved in the Old Dominion, 400,000 additional Medicaid recipients will be seeking the care of state doctors. 
Schwartz, who repeated his statistic in a June 18 op-ed in The Virginian-Pilot on June 18, said it came from a 2012 study published in the peer-reviewed journal Health Affairs.The article, written by an economist at the National Center for Health Statistics, broke down national data to show what percentage of office-based physicians in each state in 2011 accepted new patients. 
The NCHS extracted its state data from a from a survey of 4,326 U.S. doctors conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. Only 4 percent of those physicians said they did not take on new patients in 2011. 
Of that national sample of doctors, 31 percent said they did not accept new Medicaid patients. Of the Virginia physicians, 24 percent did not add Medicaid recipients -- the number Schwartz cited. 
But Schwartz glossed over some fine points in the study, creating two issues with his claim. 
First, the survey omitted doctors who practiced in hospital outpatient departments or clinics that are part of a hospital -- important sites of care for Medicaid patients. Thirteen percent of the nation’s physicians worked in hospital-based practices and 3 percent worked in community health centers, according to 2008 data from the Center for Studying Health System Change. Those numbers were not broken down by state. But they tell us that the proportion of all Virginia doctors that did not accept new Medicaid patients -- as Schwartz framed his statement --  had to be slightly lower than 24 percent. 
The second issue is that Schwartz said all of the Virginia doctors who declined new Medicaid patients did so ""because the reimbursement rates are so low."" But the survey on which the NCHS study was based did not ask physicians why they shunned new Medicaid patients. It did cite other national research that said reimbursement was a primary reason for doctors shunning new Medicaid patients, but not the only one. 
Two years ago, the Kaiser Family Foundation released a national study of the acceptance of Medicaid patients. It was based on the responses of 1,460 physicians to a survey conducted in 2008 by the Center for Studying Health System Change. 
Kaiser’s study said more than 90 percent of physicians cited multiple reasons why they accepted only some or no new Medicaid patients. The most frequently mentioned reason was inadequate reimbursement, at 89 percent, followed by billing requirements and delayed reimbursement, each at 76 percent. Other major reasons were that Medicaid patients often required a lot of clinical work and difficulties in arranging care for them from specialist physicians. 
Research has also shown correlation between the historic Medicaid reimbursement rates in each state and the willingness of its doctors to accept patients covered by the program. At the end of 2012, states, on the average, paid doctors treating Medicaid recipients 66 percent as much as the federal government paid them to care for Medicare patients, according to another Kaiser study. . Virginia reimbursed at 80 percent of the Medicare rate. 
Under Obamacare, the U.S. is paying to raise Medicaid payments for primary care providers to the level of Medicare fees in 2013 and 2014. After that, the Medicaid fees are expected to return to state control, according to Stephen Zuckerman, co-director of the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute. 
Our ruling 
Schwartz said, ""24 percent of doctors in Virginia currently don’t accept new Medicaid patients because the reimbursement rates are so low."" 
The survey Schwartz cites to back his claim did not include primary care providers in hospitals and community clinics -- who very often are the doctors that care for Medicaid patients. So the actual percentage of all Virginia physicians not taking on Medicare recipients is slightly lower than Schwarz’s number -- exactly how much lower is impossible to say because no study has computed the number.   
 Schwartz also is askew in claiming that every Virginia doctor who closed his or her door to new Medicaid patients did so because of low reimbursement rates. The survey he cited did not ask physicians about Medicaid rates. Other research has shown that U.S. doctors avoid Medicare patients for a variety of reasons that almost always include low fees. 
All told, Schwartz’s statement paints a generally accurate picture but needs elaboration. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/jul/12/dave-schwartz/dave-schwartz-says-24-percent-virginia-doctors-won/

Claim that Deen backed Obama lacks key ingredients
","
The controversy surrounding Southern cuisine queen Paula Deen has been hotter than a pan of bacon grease. 
Last month Deen confirmed that she testified she had used a racial slur in the past. The testimony was part of a pending racial discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuit that a former manager of one of her restaurants filed against Deen and her brother, Earl ""Bubba"" Hiers. 
Since the revelation, several companies have cut ties with Deen, including Target, Smithfield Foods and Atlanta-based Home Depot. On the other hand, Deen’s fans have rallied around her, and Deen is still a draw in her hometown of Savannah.   
To counter critics claiming that Deen is racist, political commentators have noted her supposed support of President Barack Obama. 
""Did (Deen) refuse to hire blacks? Has she mistreated them or paid them below the wages of white workers?"" conservative radio host Larry Elder wrote recently in an op-ed posted on Investors.com (Investors Business Daily). ""And, for what it’s worth, Deen supported and campaigned for Barack Obama."" 
Elder’s claim about Deen’s political affiliation was the latest we’d seen. But the claim has been picked up by various media outlets, including The Daily Caller, Breitbart.com and Naked DC. 
Many celebrities decline to get publicly involved in partisan politics. We wondered whether Deen had actually bucked that trend, so we decided to investigate. 
We sought comment from Deen, but her publicist was unable to provide one. 
PolitiFact Georgia checked with Elder, and through his producer we learned that the source for his Deen claim was an article last month on the conservative website Breitbart.com. That article references an Us Weekly entertainment magazine slideshow of celebrities and their political affiliations. In fact, most of the outlets that have reported a Deen-Obama connection have relied on the Us Weekly item as their source for information. 
The magazine’s online slideshow, produced in October, features about 40 celebrities (including such famous faces as Oprah, Kevin Bacon, Chuck Norris and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), the party they support and a short write-up of their political involvement. 
Some of the information includes quotes directly from the celebrities about their party affiliation. But the basis for other items is not so clear. For example, wrestler Hulk Hogan’s description says he is ""reportedly"" a registered Democrat. And the magazine lists porn star Jenna Jameson as a Republican, with this quote she gave CBS News: ""I'm very much looking forward to a Republican being back in office. When you're rich, you want a Republican in office.""  But that statement doesn’t necessarily equate to Jameson being a Republican. 
For Deen’s description, the magazine says she campaigned for Obama back in 2008 and invited first lady Michelle Obama to cook with her on an episode of ""Paula’s Party."" The write-up goes on to say that Deen later said she ""just loved"" being around Michelle and praised the first lady for her healthy eating and exercise platform. 
We contacted Us Weekly, but it was unable to provide any information on the source for its political listing for Deen. But let’s break down Deen’s description. 
Deen did have Michelle Obama on her show for a segment in September 2008. The pair fried shrimp. But Deen also invited then-Republican presidential challenger John McCain’s wife, Cindy, as well as McCain’s running mate, Sarah Palin, to appear in a segment. Neither McCain nor Palin appear in the show credits from September 2008 to the end of that year. 
At the time of the Obama invitation, Deen’s publicist made sure to note that the invite was simply an invite and not an endorsement of Obama’s campaign. 
President Obama did visit Savannah in March 2010 on a four-hour jaunt focused on jobs and energy efficiency. He did stop for lunch, but not at Deen’s Lady and Sons restaurant, nor her brother’s place. Instead, Obama ate at Mrs. Wilkes’ Boarding House Restaurant, which also features Southern cuisine. 
We also checked out Deen’s alleged support through either her checkbook or her vote, and we came up empty. A search of the federal campaign database doesn’t turn up any campaign contributions to Obama by Deen, her husband, Michael Groover, or under the name of Paula Groover. And a look at the Georgia voter rolls shows that Deen voted in the 2008 general election but does not show her party affiliation. In 1996, the last year for which a party affiliation is attached to her votes, Deen voted in the Republican presidential primary. 
In an interview with The New York Times last year, Deen was prodded to reveal her choice for president. ""Obama or Romney,?"" the interviewer asked. ""Quick, go."" Perhaps on death glares from her publicist, Deen didn’t answer, but instead gave a list of things she’d implement if she were president. Think soda cups with no size limits. 
Finally, we consulted with The Associated Press’ Savannah-area reporter, the metro editor of Savannah’s daily newspaper and a Georgia political science professor and longtime politics watcher. All three cried foul on Elder’s claim and said they were unaware of Deen ever publicly supporting Obama or getting involved in politics. 
So Elder’s claim that Deen campaigned for and supported Obama falls like a biscuit with no baking powder. 
The source for these claims traces back to an Us Weekly magazine item, and unless Us Weekly is privy to some information that it is not willing to share, there seems to be nothing to substantiate its claim. And because its information is wrong, so is everyone else -- including Elder -- who has used the magazine data as a source for their claims of Deen backing Obama. 
We rated Elder’s claim False.",/factchecks/2013/jul/12/larry-elder/claim-deen-backed-obama-lacks-key-ingredients/
"['Illinois', 'JB Pritzker']","
Pritzker’s flimsy claim that Rauner delayed school funding
","There’s no question Illinois’ record two-year budget impasse took quite a toll. State government between 2015 and 2017 ran up a backlog of more than $15 billion in IOUs to vendors as Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democrats who run the legislature squabbled over how to run the state. That jeopardized social services ranging from domestic violence shelters to mental health care. Higher education also took a hit, as public universities and community colleges laid off thousands of employees and state tuition assistance for low-income students was thrown into limbo. Yet a recent ad by J.B. Pritzker, the Democratic challenger to Gov. Bruce Rauner, assigns unilateral blame for the crisis to the now re-election seeking Republican. It also highlights a different education-themed casualty of the budget standoff. ""Want to see what failure looks like?"" a narrator asks in the 15-second spot. ""Because of Bruce Rauner, Illinois went 736 days without a budget, delaying funding for schools while local governments were forced to raise property taxes. Four years of failure is enough."" Throughout all the chaos and uncertainty of those days, Rauner and Democrats in the General Assembly managed to carve out a budgetary oasis for school funding. Multi-billion dollar appropriations for K-12 education became law even while lawmakers and the governor could agree on little else. So what exactly is Pritzker getting at? We decided to check. Pritzker campaign spokesman Jason Rubin pointed to delays that developed during the budget standoff in reimbursements to schools for so-called categorical programs such as special education and transportation. ""Bruce Rauner led Illinois to a 736-day budget crisis, jeopardizing school funding in its entirety and making the state late on critical categorical payments to schools,"" Rubin wrote in an email. ""Local governments across the state raised property taxes during this time while Rauner’s administration failed in one of its most fundamental obligations, to fund schools on time."" It’s true that hundreds of millions of categorical grant dollars, which supplement general aid from the state, were paid to schools later than usual. Data from the Illinois State Board of Education show categorical payments lagged up to nearly seven months in 2017 as the bill backlog ballooned, compared with three months or less in the years leading up to the impasse. But neither Pritzker’s ad nor the article it cites mention categoricals, suggesting instead that state funding was delayed more broadly. That’s simply not the case. General state aid, which has comprised more than 70 percent of state funding for schools in recent years, continued to be paid on time throughout the budget impasse. By contrast, just 4 percent of Illinois districts relied on categorical grants for more than 10 percent of their funding in the year before the impasse began, state records show. Pritzker’s attempt to draw a connection between the budget impasse and property tax hikes is also questionable. One key reason is the upside-down nature of school funding in Illinois. Few states contribute a smaller share of overall school dollars to local districts, rendering them highly dependent on local property tax revenues to make ends meet. So it has become almost routine for many local school boards to annually raise their property tax levies to the amount allowed by law. Districts sometimes also hold referendums to ask voters for even more authority to raise property taxes. During the budget impasse, districts that went that route were more successful in getting the okay from voters than they had been for several years prior, according to results catalogued by the Illinois Association of School Administrators. That said, the volume of ballot questions asking voters to raise school taxes was still far smaller during the budget impasse than it had been in previous decades, records show. Ben Schwarm, deputy director of the Illinois Association of School Boards, said it was more common for districts to resort to tools other than property tax hikes to cope during the budget standoff with any cash flow problems caused by delays in categorial payments. ""It was much more prevalent for them to cut their budgets and lay off staff,"" Schwarm said. Local reports from the time show cash-strapped districts resorted to taking out higher lines of credit, selling bonds, cutting spending and drawing on reserves to cover costs as they waited while the state comptroller triaged payments to struggling social service agencies, state vendors and schools. Finally, there’s the question of blame. There was partisan finger-pointing aplenty during the budget standoff, and Rauner clearly played a significant role. But he didn’t act alone. That’s why we rated a similar claim from Pritzker Mostly False in June. The impasse dragged on because the governor and Democrats in the General Assembly held very different views on a variety of key issues ranging from the management of state finances to a so-called turnaround agenda Rauner said would lead to a more robust economy but critics saw as a thinly veiled attempt at union busting. And while local school districts did face funding uncertainty in the absence of a full state budget, they were largely spared from the broader carnage of the impasse. The possibility that schools wouldn’t open their doors carried substantial political risk for Democrats and Republicans alike, so both sides acted to avoid it. Pritzker’s ad says that ""because of Bruce Rauner, Illinois went 736 days without a budget, delaying funding for schools while local governments were forced to raise property taxes."" The budget impasse did cause state reimbursements for special education, transportation and several other programs to lag. Yet the Democrat’s ad implies a far broader impact on school funding, ignoring that general state aid to fund day-to-day school operations was provided for even while a broad array of spending for other state programs was not. As for property tax hikes, it’s likely that many school districts raised their levies as the broader budget impasse was ongoing. But that is routine in Illinois, a consequence of state policies that foist the lion’s share of responsibility for overall school funding on to local property tax payers. What’s more, the ad blames Rauner alone for the budget impasse that caused the delay. But Rauner and Democratic lawmakers butted heads for two years over spending and policy priorities, meaning he hardly acted alone. There are small elements of truth sprinkled through Pritzker’s ad, but he takes significant liberties in seeking to attach sole blame to Rauner for the budget impasse and then link that to school funding delays and property tax hikes. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/sep/30/jb-pritzker/pritzkers-flimsy-claim-rauner-delayed-school-fundi/

Ted Cruz’s misleading claim: California ‘is hemorrhaging population’
","Politicians from California and Texas tend to tussle over which state is producing more jobs, or sometimes poaching them, as well as whose economy is growing faster. Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz added fuel to the long-running fight when he claimed California ""is hemorrhaging population"" in a recent Senate debate with his Democratic challenger Rep. Beto O’Rourke. Cruz argued O’Rourke offers Texas a future with higher taxes similar to California. ""There are also states that implement the kind of policies that Congressman O’Rourke supports, high taxes, high regulations, open borders, states--you look at California, which is hemorrhaging population. You know the cost of a one-way U-haul from California to Texas is more than 300% the cost the other way around.""  Sen. Cruz make his claim in the video above. In 2014, our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas fact-checked the claim that U-hauls from California to Texas are more expensive. In 2014, they found they cost twice as much as ones headed in the reverse direction. For this fact check, we focused on Cruz’s claim about California’s population -- a statement brought to our attention on Twitter by applied demographer Jeffrey Wright.  We agreed with Wright that it was time for a fact check. Our research  Asked about the claim, Cruz’s campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed to several news and government reports on Californians leaving for other states. The evidence for that is clear. We explored it in a recent fact check on Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox when he made an exaggerated claim that ""half the people"" in California want to leave. We reported that California’s once-rapid population growth has slowed in recent decades. More people have been leaving for other states than have been moving in from the rest of the country for many years, according to a February 2018 study by the California Legislative Analyst’s Office. About five million people moved to California from other states, while about six million left the state from 2007 to 2016, according to the LAO report, which cited data from the American Community Survey. Here’s who’s moving from and to California, according to the report: ""Families with kids and those with only a high school education predominate among those moving from California to its top destination states (Texas, Arizona, and Nevada). College-educated 18 to 35 year olds led the way among those moving to California from its top feeder states (New York, Illinois, and New Jersey)."" But we also found the gap between the number of Californians who left for other states and those who arrived from the rest of the country has narrowed considerably. That gap was several hundred thousand people per year in the 1990s and mid 2000s, but dropped to a few thousand per year during the Great Recession, before again increasing. Still, that’s hardly a ""hemorrhaging,"" especially considering this is only a subset of the state’s overall population.  SOURCE: Feburary 2018 report, California Legislative Analyst’s Office Overall population continues to grow The migration to other states does not mean California’s overall population is in decline. Just the opposite: It’s grown by an average 333,000 people per year since 2010 largely due to natural births and international migration, according to the California Department of Finance. California was home to 39.8 million people as of January 2018, according to the finance department. That included an increase of 309,000 residents in 2017 alone and nearly 2.3 million over seven years.  Our ruling Sen. Ted Cruz claimed California ""is hemorrhaging population"" in a recent debate. In reality, California’s population has grown by an average of 333,000 per year since 2010 due to natural births and international migration. There’s a sliver of truth in Cruz’s statement: The state for many years has lost more people to other states -- including Texas -- than it’s gained from the rest of the country. But even that interpretation of the claim doesn’t show a ""hemorrhaging."" The gap between Californians leaving for other states and those arriving from the rest of the country narrowed considerably over the past decade. In the end, the senator ignored key facts that would give a different impression. We rate Cruz’s statement Mostly False.

No, Christine Blasey Ford’s letter wasn’t written by someone else
","Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned many aspects of sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the hearing on Sept. 27.

This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Ford is a California psychology professor who says Kavanaugh assaulted her at a party in 1982.

The blogger points out phrases like ""the two scrapped with each other"" and ""I feared he may inadvertently kill me"" as examples of poor or odd phrasing. Other ""errors"" could be due to copying procedures. An ""I"" toward the end of the document has a blur that makes it look lowercase. A line of text is stretched larger than other lines in the scan.

Kavanaugh is named several other places in the letter without any text warping. Another of the ""errors"" is that Ford uses the phrase ""opportune moment.""

","The National Republican Senatorial Committee -- the Senate Republicans’ campaign arm -- didn’t hold back in a campaign ad aimed at Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. The ad, released in early August, charged that ""West Virginia Joe"" had transformed himself into ""Washington Joe."" And a key exhibit for this argument was a pricey boat he owned. Manchin owns a ""$700,000 D.C. luxury yacht,"" the ad said, illustrating the claim with a photograph showing a docked vessel. pic.twitter.com/GNwdXbFCM4 Is this accurate? We took a closer look.   Manchin’s campaign does not dispute that he owns a boat, ""Almost Heaven,"" saying it is where Manchin has typically lived when in Washington and not back home in West Virginia. In fact, the boat is hardly a secret. It has been written about periodically before; articles often mention sessions he’s held on the boat with other lawmakers to negotiate legislation and strategy. In 2014, for instance, Time magazine wrote that both ""Almost Heaven"" and Manchin’s previous vessel, the ""Black Tie,"" serve as ""a kind of floating incubator of that tenderest of Washington flowers in the first decades of the 21st century: bipartisanship."" To back up its assertion, the NRSC provided PolitiFact with a document labeled ""general index or abstract of title continuation sheet No. 1,"" the cost of the vessel was listed $700,000. Manchin’s campaign instead offered a different document with a lower dollar figure. That document, a memorandum of sale from 2014, said the purchase price for the vessel was $220,000. The document says that Manchin purchased the boat from M&T Bank, with National Liquidators as the broker of the sale. Independent experts we contacted were unable to explain the difference in the two dollar figures, beyond speculating that the vessel was purchased from a seller eager to get rid of it and later insured at the boat’s market value. According to Boats.com, any vessel ""over 40 feet long almost always qualifies"" as a yacht. By the length standard alone, that would qualify ""Almost Heaven"" as a yacht: The vessel, built in 2001, is 65 feet long, according to Coast Guard documents provided to PolitiFact by the NRSC. Whether it’s a ""luxury"" vessel, however, is in the eye of the beholder. According to the Westlawn Institute of Marine Technology, the word ""yacht ... connotes elegance and expense."" Boats.com adds, ""Just as a cocky walk would never be mistaken for a limping shuffle, yacht attitude is the net result of a combination of factors that are easy to spot as a group but hard to quantify individually."" The vessel is listed as ""recreational"" on documents. However, a less confrontational -- but similarly accurate -- description could be ""houseboat,"" since it is Manchin’s residence in Washington. The NRSC said that Manchin has a ""$700,000 D.C. luxury yacht."" There’s no dispute that Manchin has a boat docked in Washington, D.C. Its 40-foot length would generally qualify it as a yacht, but since Manchin lives there when he is in town, it could be just as easily described as a houseboat. The vessel was purchased for much less, but it appears to be insured for $700,000. Whether it qualifies as a ""luxury"" vessel is a matter of opinion. The information we’ve found backs up elements of both the NRSC’s original assertion and Manchin’s counterargument, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2018/sep/28/national-republican-senatorial-committee/does-joe-manchin-have-700000-luxury-yacht/

The NRA is the National Rifle Association, the nation’s largest gun-rights group, while Obama is former President Barack Obama and Schumer is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Manchin has a ""D"" rating from the NRA, and fought alongside Obama and Schumer for anti-gun legislation. Lying liberal Joe abandoned our Second Amendment values and disrespected West Virginia gun owners. #WVsen pic.twitter.com/jvmf9IOJV4   Here, we’ll focus on the NRA rating for Manchin. In a news release, the NRA said Manchin has earned a D rating from the group this year. In the same news release, the group said it was endorsing Morrisey and airing ads on his behalf in the Charleston and Bluefield markets. ""Contrary to what Joe Manchin says in West Virginia, he has supported the agenda of Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer by voting in favor of gun control in Washington, D.C.,"" said Chris Cox, chairman of the NRA Political Victory Fund. So it’s clear that the NRA has given Manchin a D rating this year. But the group hasn’t always been so negative about Manchin -- something the ad glosses over. In 2004, when Manchin was running for governor, he received an ""A+"" rating from the NRA and received the group’s endorsement when running for governor. And in 2010 and 2012, when Manchin was running for a U.S. Senate seat, he was endorsed by the NRA and received an ""A"" rating. ""Joe Manchin is committed to protecting the Right to Keep and Bear Arms guaranteed to all Americans,"" Cox wrote in 2012. Manchin’s relations with the NRA soured in 2013 after he and Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., proposed legislation that would have enacted tighter background checks for certain gun purchases. The NRA Political Victory Fund website doesn’t allow for searches of past ratings, although it once did, the Washington Post reported in June 2018. Asked by the Post for the rationale for removing past grades, Jennifer Baker, an NRA spokeswoman, said, ""I don’t understand — why are you asking? What does it matter to you? The grades are not relevant after the election."" Morrisey tweeted that ""Joe Manchin has a ‘D’ rating from the NRA."" That’s certainly the case for 2018, and the NRA has endorsed Morrisey over Manchin this year. But this ignores that in previous campaigns, Manchin received ‘A’ and ‘A+’ ratings from the NRA and won the group’s endorsement those years. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/sep/28/patrick-morrisey/does-joe-manchin-have-d-rating-national-rifle-asso/

Does West Virginia University’s incoming freshman class have the highest-ever GPA?
","Is West Virginia University’s freshman class this year the smartest ever? The question came up as part of an ongoing dispute between West Virginia University and fraternities over student safety. In February, WVU President Gordon Gee released a statement charting a course for future relations between the university and Greek organizations. ""Fraternities and sororities are acquiring an increasingly toxic reputation among parents, employers and members of the public,"" Gee wrote in the Feb. 15, 2018 letter. ""At West Virginia University, we are not waiting for the next tragic death, arrest or headline-grabbing incident to prompt our action. When it comes to student misconduct in our fraternities and sororities, the time to act is now."" Later in his letter, Gee wrote that following a student death in 2014, ""we have had great success in changing our overall student culture to emphasize working smart and playing smart. The result has been a rise in student academic qualifications. Last fall, for example, on our Morgantown campus we welcomed our biggest class of Honors College freshmen ever, as well as our largest overall freshman class, with the highest-ever GPA."" Friction between the university and fraternities has continued: Several fraternities threatened to bolt from university oversight, and during the first week of the semester in August, Gee sent a letter to parents asking them to ""discourage"" students from rushing unaffiliated fraternities. In this article, we aren’t going to fact-check the fraternity controversy, but one portion of Gee’s earlier letter caught our eye. Is it true that WVU’s current freshman class has the ""highest-ever GPA"" in the university’s history, as Gee wrote? On the university’s website, it says that ""the average student enrolled in WVU’s Fall 2018 freshman class had a 3.55 high school GPA, an ACT score of 24 and a combined Math and Critical Reading SAT score of 1133. Stephen Lee, WVU’s associate vice president of enrollment management and executive director of admissions and recruitment, provided PolitiFact with a partial run of older data. The data Lee provided shows that average GPAs for the previous three years were 3.47 for the freshmen of 2017, 3.46 for the freshmen of 2016, and 3.45 for the freshmen of 2015. Here’s a chart summarizing the data from Lee:   The data shows a steady increase in the freshman GPA, but the data goes back only to 1995. So we can’t independently confirm that this fall’s freshmen have the highest GPAs ""ever."" Meanwhile, the data also showed a post-1995 high for SAT and ACT standardized test scores for incoming freshmen in 2018. Gee wrote that WVU’s incoming freshman class for 2018 has the ""highest-ever GPA"" in the university’s history.

Bill Nelson cherry-picks Rick Scott's education funding record
","U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson says that under Gov. Rick Scott’s leadership, Florida has fallen short on education funding. ""Rick Scott subtracted $1.3 billion from public schools,"" Nelson’s campaign said in a September Facebook post on the page Not for Florida. A narrator in the attached video makes the timeframe a little more clear, saying ""when Rick Scott became governor he subtracted more than $1 billion from local public schools."" Beside the words ""$1.3 billion"" in Florida ink, there’s a citation for a 2013 PolitiFact fact-check. Scott, the Republican challenging Nelson in November, has defended his education funding record. We found Nelson is cherry-picking Scott’s record on education funding by zeroing in on his first year and ignoring the next several years. The video cites our fact-check of former Gov. Charlie Crist, who unsuccessfully sought his old job against Scott in 2014. Crist said Scott ""cut education by $1.3 billion"" — in his first year — which we rated Mostly True. Nelson’s ad focused on Scott’s budget but left out what happened with the next seven budgets Scott signed. As Scott approached his first legislative session in 2011, he unveiled a budget proposal at a tea party rally that included billions of dollars in spending cuts, including to education. The Republican-led Legislature backed some of those cuts. The $1.3 billion figure included the reduction in state money and the expiration of the federal stimulus funds, which was the largest chunk of the cut. By the end of his first year, Scott changed his tune on education funding. He called for a $1 billion boost to education. The K-12 budget has since risen every year of Scott’s tenure, whether we count total K-12 funds or only the state share. Scott’s spokesman pointed to the fact that the total state share of K-12 funds rose from $8.7 billion in his first year to $11.9 billion in 2018-19, an increase of $3.2 billion.   Fiscal year Total K-12 state share Total K-12 funds K-12 enrollment Per-pupil spending 2007-08 $9.7 billion $18.7 billion 2.63 million $7,126 2008-09 $8.6 billion $17.9 billion 2.62 million $6,846 2009-10 $8.1 billion $18 billion 2.63 million $6,846 2010-11 $8.91 billion $18.2 billion 2.64 million $6,897 2011-12* $8.71 billion $16.6 billion 2.67 million $6,217 2012-13 $9.5 billion $17.2 billion 2.7 million $6,376 2013-14 $10.5 billion $18.3 billion 2.705 million $6,769 2014-15 $10.7 billion $18.9 billion 2.74 million $6,915 2015-16 $10.93 billion $19.7 billion 2.77 million $7,105 2016-17 $11.3 billion $20.2 billion 2.8 million $7,196 2017-18 $11.6 billion $20.6 billion 2.82 million $7,221 2018-19 $11.9 billion $21.1 billion 2.8 million $7,407 * Scott’s first budget. The $21.1 billion for K-12 schools approved earlier this year included an increase of about $485 million, including for school safety following the Parkland shooting. While Scott has promoted the increases each year, his critics have said that the state’s education budget is underfunded and pointed out that Florida ranks 41st in per student expenditures nationwide. As we’ve concluded in similar fact-checks, the state’s total K-12 education budget has increased in raw dollars every year for the last several years. However, adjusting for inflation, we found per-pupil spending is not as high as it was before the recession crippled state tax revenues. Nelson’s campaign said in a Facebook post that ""Rick Scott subtracted $1.3 billion from public schools."" Nelson is repeating a familiar attack line against Scott, but this attack has become increasingly inaccurate as we get further away from Scott’s first year in office. Scott did oversee a $1.3 billion education cut, in 2011. Over the next seven years with Scott as governor, the education budget grew each year. That's severe cherry-picking. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/sep/28/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-cherry-picks-rick-scotts-education-fun/

Missouri House candidate misses mark on vaccine protections for manufacturers
","Steve West, the Republican challenger for Missouri’s 15th House District in North Kansas City, has made headlines recently for his incendiary claims regarding Jews, homosexuality and Muslims, among other things. His platform includes the long-debunked claim of links between vaccines and autoimmune disorders. The medical establishment, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has found no link between vaccines and autism, but a vocal minority continues to push to make vaccines voluntary. (Generally, if you want to attend  school you must have proof you have been vaccinated.) Under the subheading ""Vaccines Should Be Voluntary"" on his website, West says developments in plumbing and private transportation have eliminated the need for vaccinations. West also states that the U.S. has an autoimmune epidemic and that it began after vaccines were introduced in the mid-1900s. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, there have been cases where it was presumed that a vaccine caused a dormant autoimmune disease to show up; however, there is no conclusive data to prove that vaccines are a root cause of autoimmune disorders. The academy and other studies have said that vaccination is proven to be beneficial for children. One part of his website that caught our eye is a statement that ""PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES that manufacture vaccines have IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION!"" Given his past record of making controversial statements, we decided to take a look. While West is correct that manufacturers of vaccines have certain legal immunities, his use of the term ‘prosecution’ implies criminal activity, and civil protections carry caveats. When we reached out to West for evidence of his claim, he referenced a Wikipedia entry on the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. A reading of the act shows it was created to allow a compensation program for cases involving vaccine-related injuries or death to be settled. The goal was to stabilize the supply of vaccines in a time when lawsuits were numerous. The law created a no-fault system, which means that a company isn’t legally responsible for what happens to those who take the vaccine. Victims of vaccine-related injuries or death can file a claim with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation program. This program shields the vaccine manufacturing companies from liability while paying for vaccine related injuries or deaths. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is in charge of what constitutes a vaccine-related injury and can recommend changes to vaccines in place. Looking deeper, there was also a Supreme Court ruling in 2011, Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, that said pharmaceutical companies have federal shield laws to protect them from product-liability shield lawsuits. The Supreme Court’s decision left the legality of vaccines to federal agencies, notably the Food and Drug Administration, to determine if a vaccine is in fact harmful to children. These laws do have exceptions. Vaccine manufacturers have to properly manufacture the vaccines and could be found liable if they knowingly released a tainted vaccine. For example, under the Public Readiness Preparedness Act, a manufacturer of a vaccine may still be held liable, even after a PREP Act declaration, for ""willful misconduct."" We should note that pharmaceutical companies produce many other drugs that are not protected from civil lawsuits. For example, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals was successfully sued in 2016 for ""bundling"" one of its drugs in sales to hospitals, thereby discouraging patients from switching to other, cheaper options. However, neither the law nor the ruling address criminal action — the action suggested by West’s reference to ""prosecution."" Usually, prosecution relates to criminal charges, rather than civil actions, according to Merriam-Webster. The 1986 law and the Supreme Court decision say nothing about what would happen if criminal charges were brought up. A search through the the U.S. Health and Wellness code showed that no vaccine manufacturer shall be held civilly liable. Although manufacturers are shielded from civil damages, we could find no law that protects them from criminal prosecution. We should note that the word ""prosecute"" does sometimes come up in civil actions. If a party in a lawsuit doesn’t show up, for instance, a judge can dismiss the suit for ""failure to prosecute."" This definition of ""prosecute"" does add an element of confusion to interpreting West’s statement, but the more common usage of the term is for criminal law. West said, ""PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES that manufacture vaccines have IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION!"" Federal law and a Supreme Court ruling protects pharmaceutical companies from being held liable under civil law for damages due to their vaccines. But West said vaccine-makers are safe from ""prosecution,"" and we found no indication that a vaccine-maker or its employees were shielded from prosecution under the law if they faced a criminal charge. We rate this statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/sep/27/steve-west/missouri-house-candidate-misses-mark-vaccine-prote/

Ad misleads about NC governors opposing constitutional amendments
","A new political ad suggests that each of North Carolina’s living former governors opposes proposed constitutional amendments on the November ballot. There are six proposed amendments that would change the state Constitution. One would require voters to show photo ID to participate in future elections. Another would enshrine the ""right to hunt and fish"" in the Constitution. Others would cap the state income tax rate at 7 percent and grant victims of crime the right to know specific legal information. Then there are the pair of proposed amendments that would reduce the governor’s power by limiting his or her authority to fill judicial vacancies and shifting the responsibility for appointing elections board members from the governor to the legislature. In the commercial, a narrator opens by asking viewers to ""take a closer look at constitutional amendments Raleigh lawmakers put on the ballot this fall."" ""Every former chief justice and every former governor — Democrats and Republicans — all recommend voting no,"" the narrator continues. ""They say these amendments are purposefully vague, a blank check for politicians who could block corruption investigations and strip all of our courts of independence, permanently. The closer you look at these misleading amendments, the worse they get. Vote no."" Each of the amendments was put on the ballot by the legislature, which is controlled by Republicans. The commercial was paid for by the Stop Deceptive Amendments political committee, which is treasured by Michael Weisel. Weisel is an elections attorney who the Associated Press recently described as a prominent figure on the political left.

The group bought airtime with WRAL-TV in Raleigh and Charlotte’s WSOC-TV, the Charlotte Observer reported Tuesday. Given that most North Carolinians are likely more familiar with governors than former chief justices, let’s turn our attention there. Is it true that every living former governor — including Republicans Pat McCrory and Jim Martin — opposes each of the six amendments? Put simply: no. Republican support While all former governors made news recently for opposing the amendments that affect the governor’s office, McCrory reaffirmed his support of the voter ID, victims’ rights, tax cap and hunting and fishing amendments during his radio show Monday morning. ""It’s a false and misleading ad,"" McCrory said on WBT Radio in Charlotte. He also said he sent a letter to various media stations asking them to stop airing the ad, and threatened legal action if they don’t. ""I demand that you immediately take down these advertisements, since they falsely impute to me a position which I have vocally opposed in the media, and further because such falsehoods inflict ongoing damage both to my reputation and to the campaign to pass Marsy’s Law, on which I am a prominent supporter and endorser,"" the letter says. Marsy’s Law is another name for the victims’ rights amendment. Chris Sinclair, an advocate for the proposed amendment, emailed PolitiFact a photo of McCrory speaking at a Marsy’s event at Latta Park in Charlotte on Sept. 10. Martin, for his part, told us in an email that he holds the same view of the amendments that McCrory does. ""Personally, I am opposed to the two previously identified amendments that remove appointive authority from the governor and transfer it to the legislature (for all practical purposes, to its leadership),"" Martin’s email says. ""They appear to be the last two of the referendum amendments on all ballots. I am not opposed to the other amendments."" A denial Weisel, when contacted by PolitiFact, referred us to Stop Deceptive Ads spokesman Justin Guillory. Guillory said Tuesday the ad doesn’t, in fact, suggest that all former governors oppose all of the constitutional amendments. ""The ad clearly references two amendments that would give additional appointment powers to the state legislature. Those are the same two amendments that McCrory opposes,"" Guillory wrote in an email. ""We appreciate Gov. McCrory’s bipartisan leadership in opposing these two amendments and that’s why we chose to feature the five former governors in our ads,"" he continued. ""Part of what is confusing about these constitutional amendments is that the legislature didn’t allow titles or any other identifiers on the ballot. There are no titles for us to reference in an ad."" Guillory has a point: The amendments on the ballot will lack numbers or titles. (Read them on the N.C. Secretary of State website.) What the ad says Let’s look again at what the narrator says. Guillory says the ad is talking only about the two amendments related to gubernatorial powers. He says the narrator alludes to those two when saying they would ""block corruption investigations and strip all of our courts from independence."" But the ad makes no clear distinction between the two amendments affecting the governor’s powers, and the four others. The narrator says, ""Take a closer look at constitutional amendments Raleigh lawmakers put on the ballot this fall."" There’s no reason viewers would think to look at only two of them, specifically. Immediately after that, the narrator says: ""Every former chief justice and every former governor — Democrats and Republicans — all recommend voting no."" Again, there’s no distinction. A change Wednesday evening, Guillory sent an email announcing that the group had changed the ad. In the new version, the narrator begins the ad specifying the amendments that affect the governor’s power. ""Take a closer look at two constitutional amendments Raleigh lawmakers put on the ballot this fall,"" the narrator says. Guillory says Stop Deceptive Amendments stands by its original version, but that ""defeating these two amendments is more important than a political spat. ""We’ve sent a revised version of the ad to TV stations that clarifies which two amendments the five governors oppose,"" Guillory said. ""We continue to appreciate Gov. McCrory’s bi-partisan leadership in opposing these two amendments and the courage it takes for him to confront the legislative leaders of his own party. We look forward to working with leaders of both parties to defeat these two dangerous and misleading amendments."" Our ruling The original Stop Deceptive Amendments commercial suggests that every former North Carolina governor opposes all six constitutional amendments. That’s not true. McCrory and Martin (the only two former Republican governors who are still living) oppose the two amendments that affect the governor’s powers, but support the other four amendments. While PolitiFact appreciates the group’s effort to be more accurate, we must set the record straight for those who have already seen the original ad and rate this claim False.

NC GOP mostly wrong about 'secret DMV' created by Cooper
","The North Carolina Republican Party blasted Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper last month over reports that the state Division of Motor Vehicles opened a special-access driver’s license office exclusively for state employees. ""As hundreds of North Carolinians face long lines at DMV offices around the state, Governor Cooper created a secret DMV office just for his friends,"" the NCGOP said in an Aug. 28 Facebook post, which linked to an original report from WBTV in Charlotte. We were intrigued by the statement, which received more than 275 shares on Facebook, so we decided to take a look for ourselves. According to the WBTV report, the DMV had been running a driver’s license office from its Raleigh headquarters building since January. The office was not open to the public, and a sign outside said, ""No driver license or ID issued at this location."" The so-called ""model office"" was located in a training room where staffers test new equipment. It opened for a few days each month between January and August, but access to it was limited to state employees who received a sign-up invitation by email, as well as their family and friends, the WBTV report said. Several ""senior employees"" from Cooper’s office were among those who had scheduled 20-minute appointments, according to the WBTV report. These quick appointments would have been desirable to the public, because there have been significant lines at DMV offices across the state. On Aug. 8, DMV Commissioner Torre Jessup told The News & Observer the long wait times were due to residents seeking Real IDs before October 2022, when the federal government is set to begin requiring stricter identification to board commercial flights. WBTV reported that DMV spokesman John Brockwell originally denied that the special-access office existed, and a security guard told a WBTV reporter wearing a hidden camera that the office was reserved for state employees. WRAL News later reported that Jessup said it was not a secret or ""something we are hiding."" In another video from CBS17, Jessup told reporter Michael Hyland there was ""nothing secret about it,"" and that the office was not open to the public because it was ""behind secure doors."" A DMV statement explaining the office likened it to temporary ""mobile units"" the DMV set up for large employers across the state. The statement said both practices represented ""targeted outreach as part of an effort to get REAL IDs to North Carolinians who need them ahead of the federal deadline."" Defining 'secret' The statement also said the office had closed. But Jeff Hauser, communications director for the state GOP, pointed out in an email interview that it ""had been used for months and seemingly had no intention of being shut down until the story broke."" Hauser said the ""description (secret) comes from the multiple news stories about the office itself as well as the Merriam-Webster definition."" He noted that the dictionary defines as secret anything ""kept from knowledge or view,"" ""marked by the habit of discretion,"" ""revealed only to the initiated"" or ""not acknowledged."" The office was not advertised or accessible to the public. It opened for a few days each month to state employees who received an email invitation and their family and friends, and Brockwell, the DMV spokesman, did not originally acknowledge it, according to the WBTV report. So at least on the surface, the office does seem to satisfy multiple definitions of the word secret. But Ford Porter, press secretary for the governor’s office, said the evidence suggests otherwise. ""It isn’t a secret if you’re mass emailing and calling all state government,"" he said. ""That suggests to me that it was a little bit more open than not."" Intended use Nicole Meister, director of communications for the state Department of Transportation, explained that the office was not suitable for public use. ""It’s by no means an actual office,"" she said, adding that it was several floors upstairs and in a training room filled with testing equipment. ""We did not put out a press release opening it up to the general public because it’s not a setup that can accommodate the general public,"" she said. ""Not only is there security that you have to go through, but you have to line through hallways to go up to a fifth floor and it’s a small kind of two offices that are one."" After communicating with all state agencies to as part of its Real ID outreach, the DMV extended model-office invitations first to its own staff and DOT employees, Meinster said. But then multiple state agencies asked for mobile units like the ones sent to major corporations, so the DMV decided to extend the invitation to employees at some of those agencies, as well. ""The vast majority of those to get their Real ID at the training office were rank and file state employees,"" Meister said. The state agencies that received invitations to the model office included the departments of public safety, agriculture, cultural resources, military and veteran affairs and revenue, as well as the Office of State Human Resources, Meister said. Meister and Porter said the Office of State Human Resources shared information about the model office with the governor’s office. Reducing wait times This was all meant to speed up the dissemination of Real IDs. ""It was open to any state employee, but those are also people that you’re keeping out of DMV lines at other offices,"" Meister said. ""That was the thought process behind it."" And who was behind that thought process? Meister said the idea for the model office came from a DMV committee’s brainstorming session about ways to accommodate more people who wanted Real IDs. ""This had nothing to do with the governor’s office,"" she said, adding that the training room itself has been around since 1996. ""This was DMV employees just talking about how can we get people signed up to get their Real IDs,"" she said. We found no other evidence to suggest Cooper was directly behind the office’s creation, even though some workers from his office took advantage of the setup. At the same time, however, Jessup and the DMV are overseen by Transportation Secretary Jim Trogdon, who is a member of Cooper’s cabinet. ""Cooper is responsible for his employees’ actions,"" said Hauser. Still, the office was not reserved ""just for (Cooper’s) friends."" The DMV sent invitations to state employees of various state agencies in the same way that it provided employees of private companies special access to temporary mobile units, according to the DMV statement. ""They reached out to every agency, not just the ones that the Cooper administration oversees,"" Porter said. ""The governor didn’t create it, and it wasn’t exclusive to the office (of the governor) or any of his friends."" Meister also said both Cooper and his wife obtained Real IDs at regular DMV license offices. Our ruling The NCGOP Facebook account said, ""As hundreds of North Carolinians face long lines at DMV offices around the state, Governor Cooper created a secret DMV office just for his friends."" The statement referred to an office first reported by WBTV that offered quick appointments for state employees and their associates. The office was not acknowledged, open or advertised to the public, but Meister said that was because it could not accommodate the general public. The DMV commissioner falls under the leadership of the Cooper administration, but Porter said Cooper did not play any direct role in the office’s creation, and we found no evidence to suggest otherwise. Plus, the DMV granted access to the office to state employees from several different agencies, not just Cooper’s friends. The state GOP’s claim makes it sound like Cooper opened a special office just for his closest buddies so they could avoid long lines. But the model office’s creation was not that nefarious, even if it was kept secret. Overall, the state GOP’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

Gov. Rick Scott's Pants on Fire statement that Sen. Bill Nelson is a socialist
","As dead fish washed up on some Florida shores, politicians dished blame about red tide. Now they are debating another type of red scare: socialism. ""Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum — they're socialists,"" Gov. Rick Scott said at a Titusville event for his U.S. Senate campaign. Scott explained his comments further in an interview with Florida Today. ""They want big government and socialism,"" Scott said. ""They're both into higher taxes. Gillum said he's going to raise corporate taxes 40 percent. Nelson said that, if the Democrats get control, he's going to go back and raise the taxes. They don't believe that the tax cuts that we did this year are good for our state. If you look at their programs, they just want government to run everything."" Scott linked the duo as offering a ""very liberal, very radical and very risky direction for our state and country."" We’ve previously rated a claim from Gillum’s opponent Ron DeSantis that Gillum has a ""far left socialist platform"" akin to Venezuela as False. Scott’s labeling of Nelson as a socialist is a misleading red-scare tactic — one from the  Republican playbook this cycle after the surprise Democratic primary win of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist, in New York.   Calling a politician in Florida a socialist packs particular punch because some Hispanic voters, a battleground demographic, have fled socialist regimes. Nelson has praised Gillum and may get a boost from the voter excitement he is generating. But he does not share Gillum’s more liberal positions. Scott’s campaign said in a press release that Nelson called Gillum's support for higher taxes, government-run health care and abolishing ICE ""mainstream."" The campaign linked to a Miami Herald article that didn’t make those points. The article said that Nelson and Gillum ""represent two diverging camps of the Florida Democratic Party."" Nelson said that Gillum’s policies weren’t too progressive for Florida, but he made no specific reference to raising taxes, government-run health care or abolishing ICE. Here is what Nelson actually said about Gillum’s platform: ""You characterize it as being to the left,"" Nelson said to reporters. ""You look at his positions, they’re mainstream: strengthening education, pay teachers, clean up the environment. Go through all the issues and I think that’s where the people of Florida are."" In an interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board, Nelson showed that he doesn’t share all of Gillum’s views. Nelson said he doesn’t want to abolish ICE. When asked about Medicare for All, Nelson didn’t show interest. ""I've got enough trouble just trying to save Obamacare,"" Nelson said. ""I'm into results."" Even though it doesn’t factually check out, the Scott campaign also said that Nelson ""voted more than 300 times to raise taxes"" — which we have rated False. Scott inflates the number by including nonbinding budget resolutions and multiple votes on the same piece of legislation. The list neglects that Nelson has, on occasion, voted for lower taxes. Nelson has been a critic of the 2017 tax bill, but that doesn’t mean he wants to raise taxes across the board. He said the bill didn’t do enough to help the middle class and shown support for reversing some cuts that benefit the rich. The Scott campaign also said that Nelson ""embraced Obama’s plan to appease Cuban dictators and palled around with Assad and Hugo Chavez."" But Nelson repeatedly criticized Chavez in 2004 and 2005, calling him a ""serious threat."" While While Nelson agreed with Obama’s decision to normalize relations with Cuba in 2014, Nelson has criticized Castro. (We fact-checked a similar attack by a GOP group about Nelson’s statements about Chavez and the Castro brothers and rated it Pants on Fire.) Socialism is when the government owns (or at least controls) the means of production. Nelson hasn’t called for a government takeover of businesses. ""Claiming that Nelson is a socialist is ludicrous,"" said Philip J. Williams, professor at the Center for Latin American studies at the University of Florida. ""His stance in opposition to the tax cut bill and in support of Medicaid expansion are mainstream Democratic positions. (Even some Republican governors have supported Medicaid expansion, including John Kasich.)"" While some might describe Medicare or Medicaid as socialism, because the government is providing health insurance to citizens, the health industry remains in private hands, said Sean D. Ehrlich, a Florida State University political science professor. ""The government doesn’t control the production of health care,"" Ehrlich said, ""they merely regulate some elements and reimburse providers and consumers for their health care costs."" University of Miami professor Merike Blofield, an expert in Latin American and comparative politics, said that by the standards of other wealthy liberal democracies with public, universal health care, Nelson’s policy proposals are conservative. Scott’s description of Nelson as a ""socialist"" is an inaccurate red scare tactic. The definition of socialism is a government takeover of production, and Nelson hasn’t called for that. Scott’s campaign pointed to Nelson’s support for Gillum, the Democrat running to the left of Nelson in the governor’s race. While Nelson has shown enthusiasm for Gillum, they are not lockstep on all issues. Gillum has called for abolishing ICE and Medicare for All, and Nelson has said he does not agree. Nelson’s criticism of the Republican tax bill isn’t the same as calling for higher taxes in general. And supporting an expansion of Medicaid is not the same as calling for government-run health care.

Florida scores aren’t first: The facts about Rick Scott’s education ad
","Gov. Rick Scott says in a new ad for his Senate campaign that he likes it when ""Florida is first."" ""Fourth grade reading and math scores, first in the nation,"" Scott says in the ad. ""Eighth grade reading, first. High school AP classes and college education, both ranked first in the nation. And now, our highest education funding ever. I like it when Florida is first."" The only problem is that Florida isn’t first in most categories Scott talks about in the ad. The idea Florida has the ""highest education funding ever"" is also misleading. (We rated a similar version of that claim Half True.) Wrapping up his second gubernatorial term, Scott, a Republican, has his eye on a Florida Senate seat this November. He’s up against Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson. As evidence of Florida’s reading and math performance, Scott campaign spokeswoman Lauren Schenone sent us the 2017 National Assessment of Education Progress report and a governor’s office press release. We opened the links expecting to see a bunch of No.1 rankings for the Sunshine State. Instead, we found out that the 2017 NAEP data ranks Florida fifth in fourth grade reading, seventh in fourth grade math, and 25th in eighth grade reading. ""Florida is not No. 1 among any subject or in any grade,"" said Stephaan Harris, a spokesman for the National Assessment Governing Board, which sets policy for the NAEP. ""If you look at the categories, there are states that perform significantly higher, meaning there’s statistical significance that illustrates those states scored higher and had better performance."" The NAEP, a congressionally mandated project administered by the National Center for Education Statistics, is given to fourth, eighth and 12th graders in each state to evaluate their skills in several subject areas and compare them to the rest of the country. The Scott campaign did not respond to a request for clarification. Back in April, the governor’s office spun the results favorably, saying, ""The results show that Florida is the only state to have improved significantly in grade 4 mathematics, grade 8 reading and grade 8 mathematics between 2015 and 2017."" Other states improved in fourth and eighth grade reading, as well, but Florida is technically the only state that improved across those three metrics specifically from 2015 to 2017. However, as any student athlete MVP will tell you, ""most improved"" does not mean ""first"" or ""best."" The scores had a bit of room to climb. Florida’s eighth grade math scores aren’t leading the nation — 29 percent of students were at least proficient in 2017, compared to the national average of 33 percent. That was an improvement from 26 percent proficiency in 2015, which was significantly below the national average. Florida’s average eighth grade reading score improved slightly from 2015 but was not significantly different than the 2017 national average. Florida’s fourth grade reading scores were above the national average, not the best in the country. The ad additionally claims high school AP classes in Florida are ranked first in the nation. Scott didn’t say for what. An education department’s 2017 press release was more specific, pointing to participation in AP exams and improved scores. ""Florida ranks first in participation in the AP exams during high school and third in the nation for improvement over the last decade,"" the release said. Compared to other states, Florida did have the highest percentage of 2017 graduates who took an AP exam during high school, according to the 2017 Florida AP Cohort data report. ""Florida in 2017 had the highest ‘Percentage of Graduates Who Took an AP Exam During High School’ when comparing Florida among the 50 states, which was 54.6 percent,"" Florida Department of Education spokeswoman Audrey Walden said. However, when the numbers include 11th graders, Florida ranked fourth in AP exam participation per 1,000 11th and 12th graders in 2017, according to the College Board data about the number of students who took and passed at least one AP exam. Massachusetts, Maryland and Connecticut had more success. Florida has improved its AP exam participation in the past decade. As more people take AP exams, however, overall success wavers. Florida had a 51.6 percent pass rate in 2017, lower than 42 other states. There is one bright spot for Scott’s ad: When it comes to college education, Scott’s claim that Florida is No. 1 holds up, according to the metrics of the 2018 U.S. News and World Report survey. U.S. News put the state at the top of its 2018 ""Best States for Higher Education"" list, released in March.  U.S. News used metrics including the share of people in the state with college degrees, as well as the time it takes to complete two- and four-year college programs, tuition costs and fees state-by-state and debt after graduation. Florida was No. 1 in the higher education category in 2017, as well. Scott said, ""Fourth grade reading and math scores, first in the nation. Eighth grade reading, first. High school AP classes and college education, both ranked first in the nation."" But Florida is not first in any of the reading or math categories assessed by a national exam administered to public school fourth and eighth graders. And while Florida has a high number of students taking AP exams, they are not the highest-scoring or even the highest-participating state when looking at all AP students in 2017, not just graduates. Overall, Florida is ranked No. 1 in higher education, according to the 2018 U.S. News and World Report survey. Scott’s claim shows a sign of promise but leaves a lot of room for improvement. In classroom terms, that’s a D-minus. On the Truth-O-Meter, it adds up to a Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/sep/26/rick-scott/florida-aren-first-facts-about-rick-scotts-educati/
"['Campaign Finance', 'North Carolina', 'Ted Budd']","
Budd claims most of Manning's donors aren't from North Carolina
","U.S. Rep. Ted Budd and his Democratic challenger, Kathy Manning, had raised almost $3.1 million combined in their congressional race in North Carolina’s 13th district as of June. Manning has outraised Budd by almost $800,000 according to the Federal Election Commission. Budd has said on social media that most of Manning’s donors live outside of North Carolina. ""Most of Kathy Manning’s support is coming from out-of-state liberal donors,"" Budd tweeted on Aug. 30. He posted a similar claim on Facebook as well. In both posts, Budd cites an Axios article. The article says 55.5 percent of Manning’s campaign donors are from outside of North Carolina. The article also notes 28 percent of Budd’s donors live outside of the state. Harry Stevens, a visual journalist at Axios, confirmed the data used for the article includes all the individual contributions listed on the FEC’s site. Their analysis does not include any donations made by political action committees. PolitiFact reached out to Budd’s office to see if he has any other evidence to back his claim, but has not heard back. This isn’t the first time a politician has made this kind of claim about their opponent’s donors. PolitiFact also reported on U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson from Ohio saying most of his opponent’s donors were out-of-state liberals. What PolitiFact is checking This fact check will be looking at the share of Manning’s donors who are from out-of-state. Budd’s statement specifically says Manning’s donors are ""out-of-state liberals,"" but PolitiFact isn’t checking how many of the donors are liberal. That’s subjective, and the FEC does not keep track of how donors self-identify politically when recording donations. The Axios article Budd cites only analyzes individual contributions, and does not take PAC donations into consideration. PolitiFact will only look at individual contributions, as well. We are not analyzing any donations made by PACs. Who are Manning’s donors? Over 1,700 individuals have donated to Manning’s campaign. Many of them are doctors, lawyers and retirees. Based on information from the FEC and Open Secrets, run by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, it does in fact appear that most of Manning’s donors are not from North Carolina. Just 45 percent of Manning’s donors are in North Carolina, based on the dataset from the FEC. There are donors who gave money to Manning’s campaign more than once. We took that into consideration in analyzing the information by not including any repeat donors. What about ActBlue donors? On the FEC’s site, it appears at first glance that only a quarter of Manning’s donors are from North Carolina. There’s an explanation for that, and it’s called ActBlue. That’s a Massachusetts company which developed a fundraising software tool for Democratic candidates to use. Manning’s contribution page says it is powered by ActBlue. When the FEC makes note of campaign donations, it also lists every individual donation made through ActBlue. But not all of those donors are actually from West Somerville, Mass. It doesn’t stop there. The FEC essentially lists these donors as having made another donation outside of ActBlue. In reality, it is the same donation, and it can be confusing. Imagine having a monthly subscription to your local newspaper. You look at your bank account, and it says you’ve been charged for the month. You go about the rest of your week all jolly because you have unlimited access to local news. Until you look at your bank account the following week, and you think you got charged again for your newspaper subscription. You call your bank to try to make sense of what has happened. Turns out the newspaper company was giving you a heads up about the upcoming subscription charge the previous week, and you were actually charged just once. That’s how the FEC’s reports on ActBlue basically work. The donation was made once, but it’s listed twice under two different names. A Texas Republican congressman accused his opponent of getting more donations from Massachusetts than Texas by counting these as separate donations, but PolitiFact rated that claim Pants on Fire. The ActBlue donations do not change the fact that 55 percent of Manning’s donors live outside of North Carolina. Our ruling After combing through all of the publicly listed donations on the FEC’s site, it is true that most of Manning’s donors are from outside of North Carolina. We took the ActBlue donations into consideration, and they do not change the outcome. We rate this claim True.

Danny O'Connor's ad about Medicare, Social Security really slashes
","Lower corporate taxes beat high ones, many Republicans say, firm in the assertion that if companies can keep more of their earnings, they’ll spend it on jobs and expansion. Or else it’s all a sham to help their fat-cat contributors -- and ordinary Americans will have to pay later when their retirement benefits get shorted. The latter belief is the basis of a new ad from Danny O’Connor, the Democrat running in Ohio’s 12th Congressional District. He’s challenging Troy Balderson, a Republican who won the mid-Ohio seat temporarily after a special election in August 2018. Balderson was not in Congress when lawmakers passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, but he supported it. An announcer in O’Connor’s ad says, ""If you want to know who Troy Balderson works for, follow the money. An avalanche of corporate cash. Big banks. Drug companies. The insurance giants. Balderson backs a massive tax giveaway for them by slashing Medicare and Social Security for us."" These dots supposedly go from corporate donations to tax cuts for companies to slashed retirement programs. Let’s see where they actually lead. The basic facts on campaign contributions are simple and taken from public filings. Balderson is raising campaign money. Based on publicly filed campaign finance records through Sept. 10, he has raised nearly $1.8 million, with about $240,000 of it coming from political action committees of businesses. Whether that’s an ""avalanche of cash"" is relative, but for the sake of comparison, O’Connor, the candidate making the claim, has raised much more money: $5.5 million -- but he shuns money from corporate PACs. The ad’s announcer singles out three kinds of corporations. One is ""the insurance giants."" Yet nearly a quarter, or $11,900, of the industry’s total came from a single hometown insurer, Nationwide, based in Columbus, mostly from the company PAC. Balderson has received more than $30,000 from commercial banks so far. Yet the overwhelming share of it -- $15,500 -- was from another hometown company, Columbus-based Huntington Bancshares. O'Connor got $2,500 from Huntington's PAC in April but gave it back in June. Balderson got $14,900 from pharmaceutical and health products companies, records show. But 40 percent of that drug industry money, or $6,000, came from Cardinal Health, a Columbus-based pharmaceutical distributor. The ad then says Balderson ""backs a massive tax giveaway"" for his corporate donors This refers to the corporate tax rate reductions in the late 2017 income tax overhaul. How do the tax cuts for corporations lead to ""slashing"" Medicare and Social Security? There are two ways, if you follow this line of thinking. First, the tax cuts required the government to boost its borrowing, which means larger deficits. Second, Republicans in Congress including Balderson say they want a balanced budget. This would require changes in spending, and because the tax cuts pushed up deficits, even bigger spending cuts could be required, Democrats warn. House Republicans released a balanced-budget blueprint on June 19 laying out their ideas -- and explained how and why Social Security and Medicare would be affected if this plan came to pass: ""The Federal Government is spending far more than it takes in,"" the document said. ""This increasing disparity is largely due to mandatory – or autopilot – spending, which includes safety-net programs like Medicare and Social Security, as well as the interest on the national debt."" That drives the ""rapid rate at which the national debt is accumulating."" To fix this, House Republicans would create a dual system that let seniors stay in tradional Medicare or enroll in private plans that would provide ""the same level of health coverage"" but ""compete for seniors’ business, just as Medicare Advantage does today,"" the House document said. This would create savings for seniors as well as taxpayers, the proposal said, citing a Congressional Budget Office analysis of similar proposals in 2017. The CBO said savings or higher costs for seniors would depend on the program's design. But Medicare could save $537 billion over the next decade with these changes, Budget Committee Republicans estimated. As for Social Security, savings would come from eliminating the ability to collect unemployment benefits and Social Security disability insurance at the same time. This was projected to save up to $4 billion. Separately, President Donald Trump’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sept. 17 that with budget deficits projected at about 4 percent to 5 percent of the country’s economic output for the next one to two years, there would likely be an effort in 2019 to cut spending on entitlement programs. He did not specify where the cuts would be made, Reuters reported. Trump, however, ran on promises not to cut Medicare or Social Security.  O’Connor’s ad says Balderson ""backs a massive tax giveaway"" for his corporate donors, suggesting he ""works"" for them, ""by slashing Medicare and Social Security for us."" Balderson certainly takes campaign contributions from corporations. And Balderson supports corporate tax cuts, too. The entire tax package added to deficits -- which so far have been financed with higher federal borrowing, not cuts to retirement programs. Nevertheless, changes to those programs could come. But the idea of ""slashing"" Medicare or Social Security is not what’s been proposed. Rather, Republicans have suggested holding down their growth rate and allowing private accounts, with a lot of details still to come. PolitiFact has rated claims that say the tax cuts will lead to Social Security and Medicare cuts as Half True, reasoning that policies like the tax cuts and balanced budget bills could make cuts more likely, though not certain. But O’Connor went further. His ad said Balderson ""backs a massive tax giveaway"" for corporations ""by slashing Medicare and Social Security for us."" It’s speculative, scary and oversteps what is known to be on the table. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/sep/26/danny-oconnor/danny-oconnors-ad-ohio-really-slashes/

No, Elissa Slotkin does not support a plan that would take Medicare away from seniors
","The race for the U.S. House seat in Michigan’s 8th district continues to heat up between Republican incumbent Mike Bishop and Democratic opponent Elissa Slotkin. In his latest move, Bishop aired a 30-second TV ad featuring a senior couple from Brighton –  Ann and Richard. The couple, whose last names were not displayed, say that ""Medicare saved them"" and accuse Slotkin of supporting a policy that would bankrupt Medicare and leave them with nothing. Richard: ""When Ann was in the hospital, we thought we may lose everything."" Ann: ""Medicare saved us."" Richard: ""We are on a fixed income."" Ann: ""We have to keep to a budget. So I write down all of our bills."" Richard: ""Slotkin’s plan is to take most everything we have and give it away. We paid into the system. Why would she want to take this away from us?"" Richard: ""Medicare needs protecting. Elissa Slotkin doesn’t get that."" The ad contains no onscreen sources, recordings by Slotkin, or links to offer evidence or context. We found no evidence to suggest that any of Slotkin’s positions on health care would result in taking away coverage for current seniors. We looked into Slotkin’s stance on health care and reviewed various reports, as well as her remarks at events, in interviews and on her campaign website. We found that she does not support Medicare for All -- a program proposed in 2017 by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to create a single-payer health care system -- and has routinely criticized the single-payer system. Slotkin does, however, suggest a buy-in option for Medicare. ""I believe all Americans should have access to health care they can afford, regardless of pre-existing conditions,"" Slotkin says on her campaign website. ""To get there, I believe we need true bipartisan reform of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). We should also consider options that would allow people the choice to buy into plans, such as Medicare, that have been proven to control costs for consumers."" The option would allow any American to buy into the program, which is now only for seniors. It would also be optional, and those choosing to buy-in would likely have to pay full prices, something that current Medicare recipients do not. ""Slotkin has been outspoken on the need to lower health care costs,"" Laura Epstein, Slotkin’s spokesperson, said in a response to the ad. In a news release, the Bishop campaign wrote that Slotkin’s plan is ""risky"" and would make Medicare premiums higher, along with taxes and would threaten to end Medicare. In the release, the campaign cites a study from the Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank at George Mason University, that said Medicare for All would increase the demand for health care services while also cutting payments to providers. The study suggests that the system would cost $32 trillion over the next 10 years and wound Medicare. But the study doesn’t analyze a Medicare buy-in program, nor does it suggest that such an option would be harmful to current Medicare recipients or that it would somehow create the Medicare for All proposal. Stu Sandler, a consultant for Bishop, said that expanding Medicare to buy-ins risks higher premiums, reduces senior access and threatens the solvency of Medicare. In an October 2009 Congressional Budget Office report, the office found that the Medicare buy-in plan proposed by Democrats during discussions of the Affordable Care Act would include negotiated payment rates with all providers and suppliers, and providers would not be required to participate in a public plan in order to participate in Medicare. The report also pointed out that the public plan would have to charge premiums that covered its costs, including the costs of paying back start-up funding that the government would provide. However, nowhere in the analysis does it say that Medicare’s financial solvency would be threatened beyond its current state. A buy-in to Medicare would be complex because of the program’s multiple parts, such as institutional services (hospitals), physicians, drugs and more. But when it comes to the core question of whether the option would drive costs up for current seniors, the answer is most likely, no, according to John Holahan, an economist with the Urban Institute’s Health Policy Center. It all comes down to a separate risk pool. ""If the costs for those under 65 who would be allowed to buy in, if those costs are kept in a separate risk pool from the current Medicare program, then it really has no impact on that program,"" Holahan told PolitiFact. The AARP Public Policy Institute made similar points, saying that a buy-in could be a solution for those without employer coverage, but also said its design would have to address the need for subsidies to make premiums affordable. AARP said that the pros of a buy-in could provide: • Guaranteed access, continuity of coverage and overall stability for many older adults. • Better health and lower future Medicare costs. • Efficiency and speed of building on existing infrastructure. The organization’s concerns about a buy-in: • If it was financed through existing trust funds, it would hasten insolvency. • Further erosion of employer-sponsored retiree health benefits. • Adverse selection could limit its appeal. But, again, this is all to say that regardless of the form that a Medicare buy-in could take if implemented, it is not the same thing as Medicare for All. ""Medicare for All often means we are going to outlaw private insurance,"" Holahan said, ""and this option seems like if you’re thinking about buying into the Medicare plan, if that’s better for you, you can do that or you can also keep your private insurance. It’s a choice."" Bishop's ad says that Slotkin’s plan is to take Medicare away from current senior recipients. But the campaign’s argument relies on suggesting Slotkin supports Medicare for All, a single-payer program, that would get rid of private insurance and provide health care to all Americans. Slotkin does not support such a program, but has suggested allowing Americans a buy-in option to Medicare, alongside private insurance. And while some studies have suggested a Medicare buy-in may help ease the transition to a single-payer system, they are still two separate ideas. The ad lacks context and ignores that Slotkin has repeatedly said she does not approve of such a program. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2018/sep/26/mike-bishop/no-elissa-slotkin-does-not-support-plan-would-take/
