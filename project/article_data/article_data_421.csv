Trump did not ask supporters for $421 million to help him recover from COVID-19
","After President Donald Trump tested positive for COVID-19, a fake fundraising email from his re-election campaign started to circulate on social media. A screenshot of the bogus email, which a reader sent us on Twitter, leads with the news of the positive results for the president and first lady Melania Trump. Then, it pivots to a fundraising plea. ""President Trump would like to ask a favor. Will you please DONATE to help him recover from this disease?"" says the email, which was shared by Rev. James Woodall, president of the Georgia NAACP. ""It is only fair since he has sacrificed millions of dollars as your President."" (Screenshot from Twitter) After we reached out for a comment, Woodall replied to the tweeted screenshot with a correction.  ""This is not a legitimate email coming from the Trump campaign. Want to clarify this instead of simply deleting it,"" he said. The Trump campaign confirmed to us that the email isn’t real. So did the Republican National Committee. ""That is a fake,"" RNC spokeswoman Mandi Merritt told PolitiFact in an email. One clue that the donor plea is not authentic is its request for $421 million. That’s the value of loans and debts that Trump must pay back, according to a New York Times investigation of the president’s tax returns. The email pitch was fake. We rate it Pants on Fire!

Joe Biden’s eyes were blue during the debate, not black
","We’ve already debunked allegations that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden was wearing a wire during the first presidential debate and that he has a medical implant that lets him hear an aide tell him how to answer questions. A new entry in this category of misinformation claims that the former vice president’s eyes were black during the debate because he was wearing smart contact lenses. ""Well the Biden black eyes issue is solved,"" reads one Facebook post. ""Mojo Vision! Essentially a screen right into the eyeballs via contacts…. Joe usually has blue eyes….this is why they are black at the debate and prior conferences, they did a tester.""  The post includes images comparing photos of Biden’s eyes — in one they’re blue, in the other they look brown. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We reached out to both the Biden campaign but did not receive a response. First of all, Biden’s eyes weren’t black during the debate. You can see for yourself in this video of key moments from the event here.  Second, the ""Mojo Lens"" — the smart contact lens that a startup company called Mojo Vision is developing — is not yet on the market.  ""The lens has not been tested and certified for public use and therefore cannot be worn without being enrolled in Mojo’s clinical trial, which is managed in a controlled environment,"" a spokesperson for the company told us. ""Mojo Lens has not been worn by anyone for any purpose outside of the Mojo team, nor do we have any plans in the near future for anyone to wear the product besides a Mojo team member or a participant in a clinical trial."" Because the contact lenses will be classified as medical devices, they need certification from the Food and Drug Administration before they can be marketed, sold and used by the public, the spokesperson said.  In January, Fast Company reported that ""using a display the size of a grain of sand to project images onto your retina,"" Mojo Vision could one day help firefighters navigate smoky rooms or allow hotel concierges to identify and greet new gusts ""based on data called up from a database and displayed within the lenses."" However, the first version of the lens ""will most likely be a base model containing a core set of features for people with vision impairments,"" according to Fast Company.

No, ‘The Simpsons’ did not feature Trump in a coffin
","Shortly after President Donald Trump tweeted that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, Facebook posts started popping up claiming that the long-running TV show ""The Simpsons"" had featured Trump in a coffin. That image of Trump purportedly in a coffin in an episode of ""The Simpsons"" has been circulating for years and has been debunked. Snopes in February 2017 reported that the image did not appear in ""The Simpsons,"" and while its origins are unclear, it appears to have been promoted on the fringe forum website 4chan.

Earlier this year, social media posts also claimed that ""The Simpsons"" predicted Trump would die Aug. 27, 2020, and used that same image of Trump in a coffin. ""The Simpsons"" has featured Trump before, but we found no indication that the show aired an episode of him in a coffin. Bill Oakley, a former writer for ""The Simpsons,"" told the Hollywood Reporter in a story published March 2020 that the show gets too much credit for predicting the future and also didn’t like past episodes being used for nefarious purposes. Facebook posts have falsely claimed that ""The Simpsons"" predicted the coronavirus. We rated that Pants on Fire. ""There are very few cases where ‘The Simpsons’ predicted something,"" Oakley told the Hollywood Reporter. ""It's mainly just coincidence because the episodes are so old that history repeats itself.

Trade wars hit farmers hard, but Biden attack on Trump oversimplifies
","In wide-ranging recent comments criticizing President Donald Trump, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden touched on a topic that hits home in Wisconsin — struggling farms. Speaking in Manitowoc on Sept. 21, 2020, Biden said Trump started a trade war that ""led to a surge in farm bankruptcies."" To be sure, times are tough for Wisconsin farmers, particularly in dairy.  In 2019 alone, Wisconsin lost 818 dairy farms, part of an accelerating decline in which about one-quarter of the state’s dairy farms have gone out of business since 2014. But amid such a long-running trend, is it fair to put the onus for a ""surge"" on Trump’s trade wars? Let’s dig in. Campaigning as a dealmaker in 2016, Trump promised to renegotiate U.S. trade deals in America’s favor, and once in office he imposed tariffs seeking to achieve that end. Many countries — including China, Canada, Mexico — as well as the European Union retaliated with tariffs of their own that struck U.S. agricultural products. Between July 2018 and August 2019, for example, the Brookings Institution reported the U.S. announced tariffs on more than $550 billion in Chinese products, and China retaliated with tariffs on more than $185 billion on U.S. products. U.S. producers were doubly hit since numerous studies showed the U.S. companies primarily paid for the U.S. tariffs. The toll on farmers was heavy enough the federal government created the Market Facilitation Program, which paid out more than $14 billion to farmers in 2018 and 2019 to mitigate the impact of the trade wars. Amid this environment, farm bankruptcies did rise in 2019 — the point where you’d expect to see a spike given the trade battles occurring at the time. That year, 595 family farmers filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcies nationwide, up from 498 filings a year earlier, Reuters and others reported. Chapter 12 is a bankruptcy code created during the 1980s farm crisis to allow family farmers and small fishing operations to keep operating while they work out plans to repay lenders. Wisconsin led the nation with 57 bankruptcy filings, 16 more than any other state. But experts say you can’t draw a dark line between the trade wars and the rise in bankruptcies. Though the jump from 2018 to 2019 was the largest in recent years, bankruptcies have been rising for a while. After Chapter 12 bankruptcies dropped from 723 in 2010 to 361 in 2014, the number has steadily grown since. Farm bankruptcies did drop slightly in the first half of 2020 — the total of 284 was down 10 from the same period in 2019 — but that was ""due in large part"" to government payments made to farmers as part of the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. RELATED: Dems exaggerate in slamming Trump farm bailouts as ""handout for large agricultural companies"" In addition, trade wars are far from the only factor at play for farmers in Wisconsin and nationwide. Reuters described it this way: The increase in (2019 bankruptcies) had been somewhat expected, bankruptcy experts and agricultural economists said, as farmers face trade battles, ever-mounting farm debt, prolonged low commodity prices, volatile weather patterns and a fatal pig disease that has decimated China’s herd. John Newton, chief economist at the Farm Bureau, cited many of the same factors in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""The farm bankruptcies are a function of not only retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agriculture by China, but also years of low commodity prices created by a global economic slowdown and large supplies of grains, oilseeds and livestock products internationally and recent natural disasters,"" Newton said in an email. ""I don’t think you can lay the blame of higher farm bankruptcies on the retaliatory tariffs alone."" Speaking in Manitowoc, Biden said Trump started a trade war that ""led to a surge in farm bankruptcies."" The trade wars have indeed hit farmers hard. And bankruptcies rose at the height of the trade wars, increasing more than they had in the four prior years. But this claim oversimplifies by listing the trade wars alone as being responsible for that increase. We define Half True as a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.

Yes, coronavirus deaths in red states add up to second-highest in the world
","Former President Barack Obama once famously said ""the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states"" -- instead of simply the United States. But in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election, the candidates themselves are creating these separate ""countries"" to make their point about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  In a campaign stop in Manitowoc on Sept. 21, 2020, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden struck back at an assertion Republican President Donald Trump had made earlier in the month about coronavirus deaths: That so-called ""blue states"" were driving the country’s high death rates.  Trump, trying to burnish his performance in combating the virus, had said if those states were removed from the equation, the United States would really be ""at a very low level"" of deaths.  In Manitowoc, where Biden visited a foundry, he said Trump was wrong.  ""If you just count all the deaths in the red states, we are number two in the world in deaths, just behind Brazil,"" Biden said.  Trump is off track in claiming that U.S. coronavirus deaths, which have topped 200,000,  would be low if some states were not counted — an illogical argument from the get-go, because the country cannot be split that way.  Biden, meanwhile, is mostly on track in claiming that if red states somehow were split off, they would still account for the second-highest death counts in the world, depending on how you define red and blue states.  Let’s dig in.  When asked for evidence for Biden’s claim, a Biden campaign spokesperson pointed to a Sept, 16, 2020, analysis piece from the Washington Post, which tallies virus deaths by which 2016 presidential candidate a state supported.  By that analysis, and as of that date, the author wrote, more than 90,000 deaths had occurred in red states, which would have ranked second in the world.  The argument holds up even after considering more recent death tolls. The 30 states that Trump took in 2016 had recorded 97,329 deaths in total as of Sept. 28, 2020. Here’s the breakdown, according to a New York Times case and death tracker:  Alabama, 2,501; Alaska, 52; Arizona, 5,624; Arkansas, 1,329; Florida, 14,036; Georgia, 6,803; Idaho, 460; Indiana, 3,591; Iowa, 1,321; Kansas, 641; Kentucky, 1,195; Louisiana, 5,480; Michigan, 7,052; Mississippi, 2,921; Missouri, 2,119; Montana, 174; Nebraska, 487; North Carolina, 3,468; North Dakota, 237; Ohio, 4,746; Oklahoma, 1,007; Pennsylvania, 8,181; South Carolina, 3,337; South Dakota, 218; Tennessee, 2,362; Texas, 15,854; Utah, 453; West Virginia, 337; Wisconsin, 1,293; Wyoming, 50. If we were to only count these states, the death total as of that date would fit between Brazil at the top of the chart (141,741) and India at number three (95,542), making Biden’s claim spot-on.  Biden characterized red and blue states in a different way during his speech.  ""Think about what (Trump) is saying. He's saying, if you live in a state like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, states with Democratic governors, you're not his problem. He has no obligation to you,"" the former vice president said.  That’s defining blue states as states with Democratic governors, which Trump himself may have been getting at with his comment about blue states, in which, at one point, he cited ""blue state-managed"" leadership.  It still doesn’t make Trump’s claim accurate. It does, however, make Biden’s a bit less of a bullseye. The 26 states whose governors are currently Republicans had a combined total of 83,695 deaths as of Sept. 28, 2020, behind Brazil and India, coming in third in the world. Here’s the breakdown:  Alabama 2,501; Alaska, 52; Arizona, 5,624; Arkansas, 1,329; Florida, 14,036; Georgia, 6,803; Idaho, 460; Indiana, 3,591; Iowa, 1,321; Maryland, 3,938; Massachusetts, 9,415; Mississippi, 2,921; Missouri, 2,119; Nebraska, 487; New Hampshire, 439; North Dakota, 237; Ohio, 4,746; Oklahoma, 1,007; South Carolina, 3,337; South Dakota, 218; Tennessee, 2,362; Texas, 15,854; Utah, 453; Vermont, 58; West Virginia, 337; Wyoming, 50.  Still, the facts here are clear. No one can split the nation in half based on political parties to spin death counts one way or another.  Our death toll is what it is, and it is high — the highest in the world, by more than 50,000. Even when adjusted for population, the United States ranks 11th in the world for total deaths.  Biden claimed that the U.S. death total from the coronavirus in red states alone would rank second in the world.  Depending on how one interprets ""red states,"" this is either spot-on or close to accurate.  We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF7E2C0>],/factchecks/2020/oct/01/joe-biden/yes-coronavirus-deaths-red-states-add-second-highe/

Trump’s tax defense jumbles details, overstates Biden’s role in 2009 bill
","President Donald Trump disputed the New York Times' report that he paid little to no federal income taxes in many years, claiming in the first presidential debate with former Vice President Joe Biden that he actually paid ""millions of dollars"" in federal income taxes. At the same time, Trump also said he tries to reduce what he pays through legal tax maneuvers, and he blamed Biden for the laws that let him do so. ""I don’t want to pay tax,"" Trump said at one point. ""Like every other private person, unless they're stupid, they go through the laws, and that's what it is,"" Trump said. ""(Biden) passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We built a building, and we get tax credits like the hotel on Pennsylvania Ave.""  Trump’s claim that he paid ""millions of dollars"" in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017 is countered by the New York Times, which obtained years of his tax-return data. But we wondered about the president’s claim about a Biden-passed tax bill. Asked what Trump was referring to, the Trump campaign cited a passage in the Times report, which described how Trump got a $72.9 million tax refund due to a change made under President Barack Obama.  The change was part of a law enacted during the Great Recession. It allowed net operating losses incurred by businesses in 2008 and 2009 to be deducted from tax liability for the previous five years, rather than the prior limit restricting such ""carrybacks"" to two years. Biden was vice president at the time the provision kicked in.  ""Now business owners could request full refunds of taxes paid in the prior four years, and 50 percent of those from the year before that,"" the Times wrote. Trump took advantage of this change to wipe out the federal income taxes he paid from 2005 through 2007 with the tax refund, which he claimed and received starting in 2010, according to the Times. The refund is the subject of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service. What does that have to do with depreciation and tax credits?  Without access to Trump’s tax returns and financial records, it’s difficult to know what ""privileges"" Trump was talking about. The Trump campaign did not respond when PolitiFact asked if there were other tax bills or privileges linked to Biden that Trump was referencing. But tax experts said Trump’s mention of the historic preservation tax credit he received for his hotel in Washington appears to jumble the details between the tax refund he got and other tax deductions or credits he may have taken to reduce his tax liability over the years. ""One could view the statement (from Trump) as simply confused and getting the details badly wrong,"" said Daniel Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University School of Law. Trump’s debate-night claim has to do with the provision passed under Obama that allowed losses from businesses to be used to recoup taxes paid in the previous five years. The provision was part of the Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009.  ""A business can only carryback or carryforward certain amounts, and that bill removed some of those restrictions temporarily for 2008 and 2009,"" said Joseph Bishop-Henchman, the vice president of tax policy and litigation at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. ""It’s an efficient, relatively hidden way to help certain rich people,"" added Edward McCaffery, a professor of law, economics and political science at the University of Southern California, who noted in an op-ed that a similar provision was included in the coronavirus relief bill from March.   Joe Biden speaks at a panel on the economy in Washington on Nov. 5, 2009, one day before the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 was signed into law. (AP) In Trump’s case, the change let him request the tax refund that is now being scrutinized by the IRS and a congressional tax committee. If the IRS decides the refund was illegitimate, the Times reported Trump could owe the government more than $100 million. The audit dispute over Trump’s tax refund may center, according to the Times, on Trump’s declaration in his 2009 tax return of more than $700 million in business losses. The Times said the materials it obtained did not show which business or businesses created those losses. The carryback rule would have allowed losses incurred for any reason to be applied to income up to five years in the past, McCaffery said, including losses from depreciation, or the reduction in the value of property or an asset over time. But it’s unlikely that all Trump’s losses are from depreciation, experts told PolitiFact. The Times reported that Trump’s records show that his casinos, golf courses and other interests lose real money, and that ""he has lost chunks of his fortune even before depreciation is figured in."" ""We'd have to know precisely where the ‘excess losses’ that he had circa 2009 came from,"" McCaffery said. ""The fact that this is what the IRS is auditing strongly suggests it’s not simply depreciation, which would be based on easily audited facts."" ""There’s a lot more to what he’s done than just using depreciation and tax credits,"" added Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Other tax maneuvers documented by the Times included questionable write-offs for business expenses and a charitable tax deduction. But the $700 million in losses appears to correspond with Trump’s decision to part ways with his casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., the Times reported. There’s no obvious connection between the 2009 bill, which doesn’t mention depreciation, and other depreciation deductions or tax credits Trump may have applied. Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, said the change to carryback rules was not a tax credit. Trump’s reference to his hotel in Washington, D.C., further muddles the facts.   The exterior of the Trump International Hotel in Washington on Oct. 26, 2016. (AP) A 2015 report by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., found that the Trump Organization got $40 million in the form of a historic preservation tax credit for renovating the Old Post Office into a hotel, which the Times said he has used to reduce his tax liability in more recent years. But that type of credit has been on the books since 1976. ""This didn’t have to do with any policy change on the part of the Obama administration or Congress,"" Watson said. Laws enacted under Obama did create or extend several tax credits. Bishop-Henchman noted that Obama’s economic recovery packages extended provisions allowing businesses to deduct 50% of the cost of certain properties up front, rather than write all costs off over time. As a U.S. senator representing Delaware, Biden also voted yes on a pair of bipartisan tax laws in 1981 and 1986 that ""overhauled the depreciation system,"" Watson said, while also noting that ""depreciation existed in a slightly different form"" before 1981.  ""We don’t know how those particular changes impacted Trump’s specific tax situation,"" Watson added. ""Depreciation changes in the code are generally changes in timing of when expenses associated with an investment are deducted, so they do not impact total tax paid in the long run."" Regardless, Biden was just one senator. ""It’s always peculiar when Trump is blaming Biden for legislation that happened to be enacted when Biden was in office as a senator or the vice president,"" Rosenthal said, noting that there are many more people involved with tax legislation. Trump said Biden ""passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We built a building, and we get tax credits like the hotel on Pennsylvania Ave."" A 2009 provision enacted under Obama allowed losses to be used to reduce tax liability for up to five previous years. The Times reported that Trump used this provision to claim a major tax refund. At the time, Biden was vice president. Other depreciation deductions and tax credits that Trump may have applied — including the decades-old tax credit for his hotel in Washington — are not clearly linked to Biden or to the 2009 provision that let Trump claim his refund.  Overall, Trump’s claim is partially accurate.

Biden’s in the ballpark on how many people have preexisting conditions
","The first minutes of Tuesday’s presidential debate immediately turned to how President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg could undo the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with preexisting conditions.  ""There's 100 million people that have preexisting conditions,"" said former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, as he explained that those patients could lose coverage protections if the federal health law were declared unconstitutional by the high court. Protecting guarantees of coverage for people with medical issues is a key campaign issue. It’s among the ACA’s most popular provisions, and polling indicates that most Americans support keeping these protections in place.   Biden, who worked with then-President Barack Obama on the ACA’s enactment, is a strong supporter of the law. Trump, meanwhile, has called repeatedly for the law to be repealed and is backing a lawsuit by a group of Republican state attorneys generals trying to overturn it. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case Nov. 10.  The ACA guarantees that those with preexisting conditions cannot be denied coverage by health insurers. Despite promises that he will protect people with medical issues, Trump has not offered an alternative proposal to do so. He issued an executive order on health care Sept. 24 that included a commitment to preserving that safeguard, but legal experts said the executive order holds no enforcement power.  After Biden’s comment at the debate, Trump retorted, ""There aren’t a hundred million people with preexisting conditions.""  We thought it was important to figure out if this number was right, especially as the ACA’s future hangs in the balance. The Biden campaign provided us with several pieces of evidence to back up the candidate’s  100 million statistic, including a September article in the New York Times, an issue brief from the Department of Health and Human Services during the Obama administration and a 2018 estimate from Avalere, a health care consulting firm.  We consulted several health policy experts who also pointed us to the HHS brief and the Avalere estimate. They also cited a 2019 analysis from Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a nonpartisan health policy organization. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of KFF.)  The HHS issue brief, published in January 2017, estimated that between 61 million and 133 million Americans have a preexisting condition.  The number varies based on how a preexisting condition was defined.  In the more conservative estimate of 61 million, a preexisting condition was defined as an illness or condition, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis or heart failure, that would qualify a person for a high-risk insurance pool. High-risk pools were in place before the ACA to help people with serious and expensive-to-treat illnesses gain health coverage. They were operated by some states, as well as by the federal government, but generally covered very few people and were a drain on government budgets.  But that 61 million number doesn’t include everyone who has a preexisting condition, said Linda Blumberg, an institute fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute. ""That’s because it’s only capturing the conditions that people had which were in high-risk pools prior to the ACA,"" said Blumberg. ""We know from a lot of studies that we’ve done that insurance companies would write people up or deny them coverage for conditions that wouldn’t necessarily put you in a high-risk pool.""   Before the ACA, health insurance companies could deny you coverage for a condition as mild as seasonal hay fever.  ""Insurance companies had tools they could use to protect themselves from risky people,"" said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. ""They would dig through your medical history, and if they found something that might impose additional costs for them, they could do a variety of things.""  Corlette said those tools included the ability to deny coverage outright, charge individuals with preexisting health conditions higher premiums, or decide to offer them health insurance, but not cover the preexisting condition or the body part affected.  With that larger definition, the number HHS offered is 133 million people. More recent estimates cite similar figures.  A 2018 analysis by Avalere, a health care consulting firm, estimated that 102 million Americans have preexisting conditions. A 2019 analysis by the left-leaning Center for American Progress suggested 135 million people.  And a 2019 analysis by KFF found that 54 million people have a preexisting condition that would likely make them completely uninsurable.  ""The 54 million estimate is who wouldn’t have been able to be covered at all,"" explained Cynthia Cox, director for the program on the ACA at KFF and one of the authors of the analysis.  ""But, I think realistically, there are certainly over 100 million people who have a condition that would have caused them some trouble to get insurance on the individual market,"" said Cox. ""The 100 million includes both the 54 million who wouldn’t get coverage at all as well as the millions of others who might have had an exclusion or might have had to pay a higher premium.""  Based on the HHS estimate, Blumberg said, she would consider Biden’s 100 million figure conservative.  ""If anything, he’s somewhat on the low side,"" she said. ""I think he was being cautious with range and that is appropriate.""   While the number of individuals who have a preexisting condition varies based on the analysis, it’s clear that many Americans have a condition that could make it difficult to get comprehensive health insurance — or any insurance at all — if the ACA were overturned, said the experts.  And that’s the real point.  ""It’s easy to forget what was common practice before the ACA for insurance companies to use various tactics to dictate coverage,"" said Corlette. ""So, the 100 million, 133 million, 54 million numbers are almost immaterial. The fact is, a heck of a lot of people will face these tactics from insurance companies if these protections disappear.""  Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, agreed that the different numbers shouldn’t obscure the central idea: ""The ACA provides strong consumer protections and access to health insurance for persons with preexisting conditions, and if the ACA goes away, so, too, will those protections, jeopardizing health coverage for millions of Americans.""  However, not all think that the ACA will be overturned if Trump is successful in getting his nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, confirmed as a new Supreme Court justice.  ""The Supreme Court isn’t going to overturn the ACA,"" said Joseph Antos, a health policy scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. ""The Supreme Court has an unbroken history since the 1700s of not expanding upon the specific case that is brought before them, so the idea that somehow preexisting condition protections will be tossed out by the Supreme Court is fairly absurd.""  Whoever is elected Nov. 3 will have to deal with the court’s decision. Although the arguments come next month, it’s unlikely a ruling will be issued until 2021.  The experts all agreed that Biden was certainly in the ballpark with his estimate of 100 million people having preexisting conditions. His figure was even a little low based on a range provided in an HHS report, said one expert.   But a wide range of people — from 54 million to 133 million — could be affected, according to our reporting. Also, it is unclear how many people with preexisting conditions would be at risk of losing their insurance entirely, or facing higher costs or having their conditions excluded from coverage.

No, Joe Biden didn’t use a racist hand gesture. He was trying to illustrate the number 'zero.'
","After critics called out President Donald Trump for refusing to categorically denounce white supremacy during the first presidential debate (he attempted to clarify his comments the following day) the president’s reelection campaign is attempting to turn the tables on his opponent, Joe Biden. In an Oct. 1 tweet, @TrumpWarRoom, an official Twitter account run by the president’s campaign, displayed a still image of Biden appearing to make a hand gesture that traditionally signifies ""OK"" or ""zero,"" but has been used by some in recent years as a symbol of white supremacy.  Trump’s campaign wrote in the tweet, ""Last week Joe Biden flashed the ‘white power’ sign. President Trump condemned white supremacists yesterday. Why hasn't Joe Biden?"" This is wrong. Biden used the hand gesture twice, once with each hand, to demonstrate his claim that, in the past, large corporations, and Trump, have paid ""zero"" dollars in taxes. He has also condemned white supremacy several times, including the day before this Tweet was made. Biden has cited Trump’s ""very fine people on both sides"" remarks in Charlottesville, Va., as his motivation for running for president. The still image used in the post was taken from a Sept. 21 interview that Biden had with Fox 11 WLUK-TV during a campaign stop in Wisconsin. At the end of the interview, reporter Kia Murray asked Biden to address viewers who are worried about socialism and the prospect that he could raise taxes, should he be elected. This is what he said (starting around the video’s five-minute mark): ""I’m not trying to punish anybody, but the idea that 19 corporations, making billions of dollars, pay zero (zero gesture with left hand) in taxes? The idea that you can be making a billion dollars, or millions of dollars like Donald Trump didn’t acknowledge, when he was trying to open up a casino in New Jersey, and they had to show his tax returns. He paid zero taxes (zero gesture with right hand) and what did he say when they asked, ""Well how do you feel about that?’ ""Well it just proves I’m smarter than everybody else."" He knows — these guys know how to game the system. The gaming’s going to be over when I’m elected."" We reached out to the Trump campaign but did not hear back. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the hand gesture’s meaning has evolved over time, and started to acquire a new significance in 2017 when members of the website 4chan, a fringe platform where users are known to create and spread misinformation, promoted the common gesture as if it were a hate symbol.  ""The ‘okay’ gesture hoax was merely the latest in a series of similar 4chan hoaxes using various innocuous symbols,"" the ADL says on its website, ""in each case, the hoaxers hoped that the media and liberals would overreact by condemning a common image as white supremacist."" Their campaign was successful, and while the gesture was first being used as ironic or satirical, by 2019 at least some white supremacists adopted it. ""The overwhelming usage of the ‘okay’ hand gesture today is still its traditional purpose as a gesture signifying assent or approval,"" the ADL site says. ""As a result, someone who uses the symbol cannot be assumed to be using the symbol in either a trolling or, especially, white supremacist context unless other contextual evidence exists to support the contention. Since 2017, many people have been falsely accused of being racist or white supremacist for using the ‘okay’ gesture in its traditional and innocuous sense.""  The context of Biden’s gesture was to illustrate ""zero."" Biden has denounced white supremacy many, many times.

Geriatrics experts say Brit Hume’s claim that Joe Biden is ‘senile’ is wrong
","A persistent Republican line of attack against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is the allegation that he is not mentally fit to lead the nation. President Donald Trump amplifies that claim at his rallies and so do pundits on Fox News. On the night of the Sept. 29 presidential debate in Cleveland, Fox News’ senior political analyst Brit Hume said on TV that despite Trump’s claims about Biden’s health, Biden might do okay at the debate, since Biden ""did just fine"" when he debated Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., during the Democratic primary. Hume then called Biden ""senile."" ""Elderly people experiencing memory loss and other problems associated with age can go for periods, for hours at a time and be just fine,"" Hume said before the debate. ""I don’t think there’s  any doubt Biden’s senile, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to show up tonight. ... And now that the expectations for him have been set so low, you know if he comes out and doesn’t drool and gets through everything pretty well it could end up being quite a boost for him."" Hume, who is the same age as Biden, 77, for more than a year has argued that Biden is losing his memory and is ""getting senile."" Hume has said he has ""traces of this myself, I know what it feels like."" In an August 2019 tweet, Hume said the word senile ""is a colloquial term"" and that ""it is perfectly reasonable to suggest an old man with obvious memory issues is showing signs of senility. Look the word up."" Broadly, the word senile is defined as pertaining to old age. But often it is used by some people in association with memory loss problems or diseases that are not a normal part of aging. PolitiFact contacted experts in the health care of older people for their take on Hume’s use of the word senile and its application to Biden. They said Hume’s characterization is wrong. It’s ""a shameful display of ageism and ignorance,"" said Donald Jurivich, Eva Gilbertson Distinguished Professor of Geriatrics and Chairman of Geriatrics at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine & Health Sciences. The word ""senile"" may create a mental picture of someone who has stooped posture, is slow moving and cognitively impaired, Jurivich said. ""I don't think any of these descriptors match Joe Biden's demeanor and vigor,"" he said. From a geriatrician's perspective, Jurivich said, ""the use of ‘senile’ is a pejorative descriptor and reflects unmitigated ageism."" In December 2019, Biden’s primary care physician, at Biden’s request, issued a summary of his medical and surgical history. ""Vice president Biden is a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency, to include those as chief executive, head of state and commander in chief,"" wrote Kevin C. O’Connor, Biden’s doctor since 2009 and director of executive medicine at The GW Medical Faculty Associates. Senility is not a precise medical term, but is often used in place of the more precise and accepted medical term of ""dementia,"" said Kenneth Langa, Cyrus Sturgis Professor of Medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School.  Jurivich also said that decades ago, ""doctors lacking knowledge at the time may have used the term ‘senile dementia’ as (a) component of aging, which we now know to be untrue."" There is a range of cognitive decline or changes that can happen as someone ages, and nearly everyone has some slowing of brain function with aging, Langa noted. Increasing difficulty in finding words or remembering names is also nearly universal, he said. Dementia is defined as cognitive decline that is severe enough to cause someone to lose the ability to function independently in daily life, Langa said. ""Joe Biden clearly does not have dementia,"" he said. ""It is possible that Biden may have more difficulties finding some words and speaking smoothly than when he was younger,"" Langa said. But that does not mean he is ""senile"" or even that he has ""mild cognitive impairment,"" he said. Jurivich said he has seen Biden in person and watched him during the debates with Trump and with Democratic primary candidates. He said he’s noticed that periodically Biden ""pauses and has a perplexed look on his face as he collects himself to compensate for his stutter."" ""It is said that up to 80% of communication is through non-verbal cues, and I feel that people misinterpret Joe Biden's facial expressions as something other than his adaptations to a childhood speech impediment,"" Jurivich said. While it might be possible to get some sense as to whether someone has severe cognitive impairment by watching them on TV, a more precise diagnosis would require some kind of standardized testing to get a better sense of how well the person’s brain is working and a sense of the severity of their impairment, Langa said. We reached out to Fox News asking whether Hume’s claims were based on any specific doctor review of Biden and for information Hume would like to provide to support his case. We did not hear back. When Hume made the claim, he was speaking to Fox host Tucker Carlson, who called it ""a very smart point"" ahead of the debate. Carlson had a different take the next night. ""As a political matter, the main thing we learned last night is that it was a mistake to spend so much time focusing on Joe Biden's mental decline,"" Carlson said, adding that ""yes, it’s real"" and that Biden is ""fading."" He added: ""But on stage last night, Biden did not seem senile. If you tuned in expecting him to forget his own name — and honestly, we did expect that — you may have been surprised by how precise some of his answers were."" Hume said there isn’t ""any doubt Biden’s senile."" Actually, there’s quite a lot of doubt. Geriatrics experts said they do not observe Biden to be ""senile"" — a word that may imply someone is slow moving and cognitively impaired. The word ""senile,"" which one expert said was a pejorative, is also often used by some people to mean dementia. A person with dementia has difficulties independently carrying out daily life functions. The experts we spoke to said Biden does not exhibit this problem.

Fact-checking Trump’s debate comment that poll watchers were ‘thrown out’ of Philly polling places
","In the final moments of Tuesday’s raucous presidential debate, President Donald Trump attempted to undermine confidence in the election by complaining that his supporters had been blocked from observing the first day of in-person early voting in Philadelphia. ""Today there was a big problem,"" Trump said on the debate stage. ""In Philadelphia they went in to watch. They’re called poll watchers. A very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren’t allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia, bad things."" Trump’s accusation is full of misinformation. Under state law, poll watchers in Pennsylvania may only observe voting at traditional polling places on Election Day, and they must be certified by the state to do so. But the state hasn’t designated any Republican poll watchers yet — that’s typically done a few days before an election. And even if the state had, those people wouldn’t be allowed to watch anything until Nov. 3. So, what is Trump talking about? Let’s unpack his remarks. On Tuesday, Philadelphia opened new satellite elections offices where mail ballots can be requested, completed, and submitted. ""It’s a mail-in vote without having to use the mail,"" Lisa Deeley, chair of the Philadelphia city commissioners, said outside the Liacouras Center at Temple University, where one of the new offices is located. On Tuesday afternoon, a woman arrived at the satellite office inside Overbrook Elementary School in West Philadelphia, and told a supervisor she was there to monitor ""the integrity of the election."" The supervisor told her she was not allowed inside the building unless she wanted to use the office’s services. Again: Poll watchers in Pennsylvania are only allowed to observe voting on Election Day. The woman told The Inquirer she had been hired by the Trump campaign to monitor the West Philadelphia site and calmly stated she had a right to be inside. Once again: She did not. No poll watchers in Pennsylvania will be allowed until Nov. 3. The state also requires that poll watchers be registered to vote in the county where they wish to observe voting. The Trump campaign has been fighting in federal court since July to overturn that requirement, and to get approval for poll watchers to have access to all locations in Pennsylvania where votes are being cast — a move that would open access to sites like the one at the heart of the president’s debate night accusations. Satellite offices are a new feature of Pennsylvania elections created under Act 77, a law enacted last year that permits any registered voter to cast a ballot by mail. The satellite offices make it easier for voters to request and submit mail ballots. Previously, voters could only request mail ballots through the mail or in person at the main county elections offices. They now have more places to go. It’s also important to note that none of the mail ballots submitted at satellite locations popping up across Pennsylvania in the weeks ahead are allowed to be counted until Election Day under state law. Trump said poll watchers were ""thrown out"" of a polling place in Philadelphia. But the incident we witnessed, and any others that occurred Tuesday, took place at satellite offices, not at traditional polling places. And they involved self-appointed observers, not licensed poll watchers. While mail voting was indeed happening in physical locations Tuesday, and Trump supporters tried to watch, that voting wasn’t happening at polling places and those supporters weren’t poll watchers. Trump either knew or should have known that poll watchers aren’t allowed at satellite locations, because his campaign is fighting in federal court right now to change that. His statement is not accurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6A4DC0>],/factchecks/2020/oct/01/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-debate-comment-poll-watchers-/

Are the suburbs “by and large integrated,” as Joe Biden said?
","Ever since the racial justice protests this summer, President Donald Trump has painted a near-apocalyptic picture of the threat facing the nation’s suburbs, suggesting that their once-peaceful existence is now under violent siege. ""The ‘suburban housewife’ will be voting for me,"" Trump tweeted in August, explaining that ""they want safety."" The “suburban housewife” will be voting for me. They want safety & are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge! @foxandfriends @MariaBartiromo This theme cropped up again during the first debate between Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Trump charged that if Biden ""ever got to run this country … our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before."" Biden fired back, saying, ""I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There’s many people today driving their kids to soccer practice … Black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past."" Studies suggest that there’s a lot of truth to the notion that today’s suburbs ""are by and large integrated"" compared with how they were in previous decades. Still, experts told PolitiFact that this is a topic that defies easy characterizations. Biden’s assertion leaves out some significant nuances. ""Biden is right in the broadest sense that ‘the suburbs’ collectively are much more diverse than in 1950,"" said Jenny Schuetz, a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. However, she added, ""individual suburban jurisdictions are still relatively segregated, and there's a ton of variation across metro areas that's hard to summarize neatly."" In the 1950s, the suburbs collectively were mostly non-Hispanic white, with a big gap in the racial makeup between suburbs and central cities, Schuetz said. That changed both for legal reasons, such as the end of restrictive covenants that barred minority homebuyers, as well as changing social attitudes. A 2017 analysis by Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies used two metrics to gauge how integrated American neighborhoods have become. The first approach defined integrated neighborhoods as ones in which no racial or ethnic group accounted for 50% of the population. The number of these ""no-majority neighborhoods"" rose by 54% between 2000 and 2011-15, and the share of the U.S. population residing within these neighborhoods increased from 8% to 12%. The second measurement considers a neighborhood integrated if it meets both of the following benchmarks: if any community of color accounts for at least 20% of the population, and if the population is at least 20% white. (Unlike the first method, this one would count a neighborhood that is, say, 51% white and 49% black as integrated.) The number of these ""shared neighborhoods"" increased by 25% between 2000 and 2011-15, and the share of the U.S. population residing in these neighborhoods rose from 23.9% to 30.3% over that period.  These numbers account for cities, not just suburbs, and some of this growing integration is occurring in big cities, partly due to gentrification.  Still, experts say, a lot is happening in the suburbs. ""Most immigrants who arrive in the U.S. today, most of whom are either Latinx or Asian, settle in metropolitan-area suburbs rather than the city proper, making for a more diverse mix in those areas,"" said Meghan Ashlin Rich, a sociologist at the University of Scranton. Erica Frankenberg, a professor of education and demography at Penn State, cited research that suburban schools ""serve incredibly diverse students by race and class, which is much different than it was in the 1950s or even the 1990s."" ""The suburbs do a good job of providing services and low taxes,"" said Myron Orfield, director of the University of Minnesota’s Institute on Metropolitan Opportunity. A big share of students of color who go on to attend college come from suburban schools, he said. Diverse suburbs ""are pretty happy places,"" Orfield said. ""They are the places where white and non-white people tend to get along the best."" Yet while the suburbs broadly are much more ethnically and racially diverse than they were decades ago, the data points to a few important asterisks. One is that whites remain less likely to live in integrated neighborhoods than minorities are. The Harvard study found that while 30.3% of the U.S. population lives in a ""no-majority"" tract, only 22.9% of white Americans do. That’s well below the percentages for minority groups: 43% for Blacks, 42.8% for non-white Hispanics and 44.8% for Asian Americans. Another issue is that the minorities who move to the suburbs tend to be those who are better-off financially. This has left cities with predominantly minority neighborhoods that are disproportionately lower-income (and that are more at risk of having residents displaced by gentrifying whites). And a third issue is that whites can leave increasingly diverse suburbs, Orfield said. ""Suburbs don’t necessarily stay integrated,"" because some whites are choosing to move to further-out exurbs that are less diverse, he said. Biden said that the suburbs ""are by and large integrated."" Studies show that suburbs today are, on the broadest level, significantly more integrated today than they were in previous decades. However, more than two-thirds of Americans, and three-quarters of whites, still do not live in substantially integrated neighborhoods. Biden’s statement goes somewhat further than the data indicates, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC963780>],/factchecks/2020/oct/01/joe-biden/are-suburbs-and-large-integrated-joe-biden-said/

Donald Trump’s dubious statement about presiding over ‘the greatest economy’ in history
","During the first presidential debate in Cleveland, President Donald Trump repeated an assertion he’s made literally dozens of times. When the novel coronavirus appeared, Trump said, ""I had to close the greatest economy in the history of our country."" The U.S. economy prior to the coronavirus was strong. But it was not the best in the nation’s history, economists say. The strongest evidence for Trump is the unemployment rate. On Trump’s watch, the unemployment rate plunged to levels that it hasn’t touched since the early 1950s. It appears to be the lowest peacetime unemployment rate over a three-year period, going back to the Great Depression, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.   Trump benefited from the continuation of trends that had been in place under the Obama recovery.  ""While Trump can take some credit, I see it like the relief pitcher who comes in during the 9th inning with a seven-run lead, then boasts about winning the game,"" said Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""It’s fine to get some credit for holding the lead, but this is much more an Obama story than a Trump story."" Growth in the nation’s gross domestic product — probably the single most important statistic used to gauge the overall strength of the economy — has been so-so on Trump’s watch. It didn’t reach his pledge of 4% growth a year, earning it a Promise Broken.   The annual increases in GDP under Trump were broadly similar to what they were during the final six years under his predecessor, Barack Obama. And GDP growth under Trump was well below that of prior presidents. If you adjust GDP to take account of population, the picture remains weak for Trump. Calculations by Burtless found that inflation-adjusted GDP per capita increased 1.9% annually under Trump, which makes this three-year period the 16th highest among the past 30 non-overlapping three-year periods — right about average compared with his predecessors. Economists added a couple other factors that cast doubt on the supremacy of the economy under Trump. One is wages. Adjusted for inflation, wages that began rising during the Obama years continued to increase under Trump. But these inflation-adjusted wage increases were modest compared with the 2% a year seen in the 1960s. ""This is not what you would expect with a 3.5% unemployment rate,"" Baker said, alluding to the pre-pandemic rate of February 2020.  In addition, federal deficits relative to GDP have historically fallen during ""great"" economic periods, such as the 1960s and the late 1990s, when unemployment rates weren’t much higher than what the U.S. experienced before the pandemic, said Steve Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis.  By contrast, under Trump, the federal budget deficit widened even before the pandemic hit and has grown further during the crisis. Another factor undermining Trump’s claim is that the Federal Reserve was feeding the economy with historically low interest rates — rates on par with what the Fed usually enacts during poor economic times to revive the economy. In fact, the Fed went so far as to interrupt its plan to ""normalize"" interest rates by stopping interest-rate increases in early 2019, and it began cutting rates in August 2019, well before the pandemic. (The Trump administration made it clear that it wanted to keep rates low.) This ""certainly contradicts the assessment of the economy as being ‘great,’"" Fazzari said. Burtless also looked at the growth rate in personal consumption per person, adjusted for inflation — a metric that for many families is the bottom line of economic activity, determining how much they can spend on food, clothing, housing, health care, and travel.  In Trump’s three years in office through January 2020, real consumption per person grew by 2% a year. Of the 30 non-overlapping three-year periods since 1929, this ranks Trump 12th from the bottom. Presidents can have an impact on economic conditions, but they are not the only factor. Oil price fluctuations, changes in technology and the state of the global economy are among the things outside of their control. In Trump’s case, even the things he did, such as the 2017 tax cut, had ""disappointing"" results for economic growth, Fazzari said. ""According to its supporters, the tax cut was supposed to rocket GDP growth upward and, in particular, stimulate business capital investment,"" Fazzari said. ""Neither has happened."" Specifically, he pointed to the inflation-adjusted rate of nonresidential private fixed investment, which measures purchases of such items as nonresidential structures, equipment and software. This metric rose for a while after the tax cut passed, but since then has been on a downward trend and actually went negative in late 2019 before collapsing during the pandemic.  Trump said that before the coronavirus pandemic, the United States had ""the greatest economy in the history of our country."" Economists pointed to multiple data points that undermine this assertion. While unemployment was near historical lows under Trump, growth in gross domestic product was well below what previous presidents achieved, and other metrics such as wages and business investment ranged from decent to mediocre.

Trump’s COVID program for uninsured people: It exists, but falls short
","In a wide-ranging executive order, President Donald Trump this month outlined some of the efforts he has made to affect health care since taking office. One involved uninsured people and the current pandemic. The administration, Trump said, set up a program to provide them ""access to necessary COVID-19-related testing and treatment."" Did it? We asked the White House for more specifics about the program Trump mentioned but did not get a reply. Nonetheless, experts said he is likely referring to reimbursement assistance to help pay the COVID testing and treatment costs of uninsured patients available through the Provider Relief Fund. This fund was established by Congress in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act to bolster eligible health care providers for lost revenue or expenses related to the pandemic. The Trump administration said this spring it would tap into the fund to reimburse providers who test and treat uninsured COVID patients; hence, the executive order’s reference to ""coverage access."" Here’s how it works: The assistance doesn’t go directly to patients. Instead, health care providers can apply for reimbursement of costs associated with testing or treating uninsured people for COVID-19. Patients must be uninsured and their primary diagnosis must be COVID-19. The program does not check immigration status in determining eligibility. Our experts acknowledged that the fund overall has helped providers by making money available, especially important since many physicians, hospitals and other health care facilities are struggling with reduced income as elective surgeries and visits have nose-dived during the pandemic. The relief fund pays providers at standard Medicare rates for testing or treating uninsured COVID patients. Still, many patients, and some providers, don’t know about the funding to reimburse for uninsured costs. And even providers who are aware of it don’t necessarily know how to use it. Hospitals and other providers are not required to publicize it. Additionally, eligibility restrictions can make it hard for some patients to qualify to have their bills paid. ""It’s absolutely not broad protection or a guarantee of coverage,"" said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow with KFF. ""People are uninsured. They remain uninsured. If they don’t know how to ask for this or the provider can’t figure out how to use it, [their bills] are uncollectable."" Even before the pandemic, uninsured patients had a hard time finding medical care, often delaying needed medical services until a crisis sent them to the hospital. Federal law ensures that no one needing emergency care be turned away and must be treated until stabilized. The relief fund program came amid calls from health insurers, Democrats and others for the Trump administration to reopen enrollment in the Affordable Care Act through the federal marketplace, which operates in 38 states. Usually, the insurance sign-up period occurs each November. When the virus began causing concern in the U.S. in the spring, some of the 12 states (and the District of Columbia) that run their own marketplaces moved to reopen because of the pandemic, so uninsured residents could sign up. But the Trump administration decided not to reopen the federal marketplace. Uninsured people who want to enroll either have to wait to sign up starting in November for coverage next year or see if they qualify for a special enrollment because they have experienced one of several ""qualifying life events."" One such event is job loss that ends health coverage. That potentially left hospitals and other medical providers holding the bag for the uninsured who fall sick with COVID. Enter the relief fund. The Health Resources and Services Administration said the fund so far has handed out a little more than $1 billion for uninsured patient reimbursement, a substantial amount but well short of publicized estimates of what it will ultimately cost hospitals and medical providers to test and treat uninsured COVID patients. ""We are appreciative"" that Congress and the administration ""did provide some coverage for the uninsured,"" said Molly Smith, vice president for coverage and state issues at the American Hospital Association. ""But we don’t think it’s the best approach for covering the uninsured."" Hospitals would have preferred something that ""would have expanded comprehensive coverage."" Parts of the program work well, she said, but ""there are some pretty substantial flaws."" When it comes to program eligibility, two main criteria present hurdles for patients: fitting the definition of ""uninsured"" and receiving a primary diagnosis of COVID-19. Failing either test could make a patient ineligible. In that case, the hospital or medical provider can either seek payment from the patient — or eat the cost. To qualify for coverage, the patient cannot have any kind of health insurance coverage, according to guidelines published online by HRSA. Even having very limited coverage — such as a program in Medicaid that covers only family planning services such as birth control — would disqualify a patient, said Smith. Another disqualification would be the purchase of one of the limited coverage plans touted by the administration that don’t cover all the same services an ACA plan would include. The second hurdle: COVID-19 must be the primary diagnosis. ""If someone with a heart attack comes in and it turns out COVID is also involved — or could have even been the trigger,"" the provider might not be eligible for reimbursement, said Jack Hoadley, a research professor emeritus at Georgetown University. Another common example, Smith said, is a patient with COVID-19 who develops sepsis, a life-threatening blood infection. Under long-standing coding and billing rules, sepsis would be the primary diagnosis, making any coronavirus-related patient care ineligible under the provider relief program. The Trump administration did implement a program to reimburse medical providers for testing and treatment of some uninsured patients, tapping into funding allocated by Congress. Whether — and to what extent — the measure improved ""coverage access"" to care is hard to determine. The fund has paid out more than $1 billion so far. The administration chose this route, which experts said was an incomplete fix, over following some states’ lead in allowing a special enrollment period on the federal marketplace, which would have enabled people without health insurance to buy more comprehensive coverage. Meanwhile, the program has not been publicized and has confusing eligibility rules — both of which have led to speculation that it is not being used as widely as possible. The administration’s program appears to provide narrow financial assistance for COVID-related health care costs. But patients who fall through the cracks may find themselves facing substantial bills.

Sen. Ron Johnson overreaches with asylum-seeker claim
","Since being sworn in as president, Democrat Joe Biden has signed a series of executive actions and orders, about half of which are aimed at reversing policies put in place under Donald Trump, his Republican predecessor.   About 22 of more than 50 executive orders issued as of Feb. 25, 2021, have involved immigration issues, including changes to a Trump-era policy known as MPP -- Migrant Protection Protocols -- that required those seeking asylum at the southern border to wait in Mexico for their cases to move through U.S. immigration courts.  Biden’s action prompted this tweeted response on Feb. 12. 2021 from U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin: ""Biden’s plan will immediately let in 25,000 asylum-seekers who’d been waiting in Mexico as their cases were judged.""  Is Johnson correct?  When asked to provide backup for the claim, Johnson spokesman Ben Voelkel pointed to a Feb. 11, 2021 news release from the Department of Homeland Security that announced the program, then simply reasserted his boss’ claim. Of the 25,000 people who Johnson said could be let in, Voelkel added: ""We have been told this could happen within a few weeks."" Fair enough. But it’s unclear just who told Johnson or his office this. Voelkel has not responded to followup questions about this from PolitiFact Wisconsin.  Voelkel’s original response also asserted: ""These people will be let into the U.S. while they wait for their asylum claims to be adjudicated even though we know a vast majority of them do not have valid asylum claims and will likely stay even when their claims are denied."" But the news release from the Department of Homeland Security, which Voelkel cited as evidence, actually undermines Johnson’s claim. The news release, which noted the first phase of a new program would begin on Feb. 19, 2021, quoted Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas saying the Biden administration ""is committed to rebuilding a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system.""  The release warned that ""changes will take time"" and ""individuals who are not eligible under this initial phase should wait for further instructions and not travel to the border."" Meanwhile, according to a Feb. 12, 2021, Associated Press report, DHS officials said the department would begin slowly, by allowing in a fraction of asylum-seekers — about 300 people per day — from among an estimated 25,000 people with ""active cases"" in the former MPP program.   In practice, however, that 300 per day was significantly lower when the program launched on Feb. 19, 2021, with just  25 MPP asylum-seekers admitted at a port of entry in San Ysidro, California, and taken to a hotel for quarantine. The group included six families and five individuals from Honduras, Peru, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Cuba. According to the department, a similar number were admitted each day in San Ysidro during the week of Feb. 21, 2021. On Feb. 24, 2021, DHS announced it would begin processing people currently at the Matamoros camp in Mexico, located across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas.  According to the department, while still in Mexico, asylum-seekers must register virtually on a website. They are then contacted for an appointment during which they are screened for eligibility to enter the United States. They are also tested for COVID-19. If they pass the screening process they are transported to a United States port of entry, where they are processed.  ""We will work in partnership with the Government of Mexico, and partners on the ground, to facilitate the safe processing of current camp residents who qualify for this program,"" DHS said in a news release. ""New arrivals to the Matamoros camp will not gain entry into the United States through this limited process."" In addition to the San Ysidro port of entry, DHS said on Feb. 25, 2021, another 25 people were processed at a port of entry in Brownsville, Texas, and the department expected to process a similar number in El Paso, Texas. So, after more than a week of the program, it’s clear the influx of 25,000 asylum seekers has not been ""immediate"" as Johnson claimed it would be. Instead it has been more of a trickle than a flood. Johnson said ""Biden’s plan will immediately let in 25,000 asylum-seekers who’d been waiting in Mexico as their cases were judged."" While the Biden plan changes the Trump approach, and returns to a system that allows asylum seekers into the country while their cases are being considered, Johnson’s tweet leaves the impression there would be a wave of 25,000 people admitted instantly. That’s far from the case, at least as things stand more than a week into the new program. Even if the number does hit the projected 300 a day, that alone would mean it would take some 83 days to reach 25,000. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD66B00>],/factchecks/2021/mar/01/ron-johnson/johnson-overreaches-asylum-seeker-claim/

No, Atlanta’s mayor is not shutting down the city for NBA All-Star Game weekend
","A Facebook post falsely claimed that Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms is shutting down the city in connection with the NBA All-Star Game being played there on March 7. In capital letters, the post said:  ""SO THE MAYOR OF ATLANTA SHUTTING THE CITY DOWN FOR ALLSTAR WEEKEND."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Even before the NBA officially announced that the game would be held in Atlanta, Bottoms asked that people not travel to her city for the game, and asked that businesses not hold events in connection with it. She didn’t order any shutdowns. It all relates to the coronavirus. The COVID-19 pandemic led the NBA to relocate the All-Star Game from Indianapolis in 2021. The league said ""public health conditions prevented"" it ""from appropriately planning and executing fan-focused All-Star activities in Indianapolis."" At the time, the league said revised plans for the 2021 game would be announced later but that it did plan for the game to come to Indianapolis in 2024.  Debate ensued among players and others about whether the game should be played in 2021.  But the NBA announced Feb. 18 that the 2021 game would be held March 7 in Atlanta — it would be limited, however, to one evening inside the arena hosting the game, rather than a weekend of events at various venues.  ""For the well-being and safety of the greater Atlanta community, there will be no fan activities, ticketed events or hospitality functions,"" the league said. Bottoms issued orders after the pandemic emerged in March 2020 that temporarily shut down bars and nightclubs that do not serve food, gyms and fitness centers, movie theaters, live performance venues, bowling alleys, arcades and private social clubs, and that ordered residents to stay in their homes. Bottoms issued her statement about the All-Star Game on Feb. 16, two days before the NBA made its announcement. She made it clear she didn’t want any public gatherings associated with the game, but didn’t order any shutdowns. She said:  ""Under normal circumstances, we would be extremely grateful for the opportunity to host the NBA All-Star game, but this is not a typical year. I have shared my concerns related to public health and safety with the NBA and Atlanta Hawks. We are in agreement that this is a made-for-TV event only, and people should not travel to Atlanta to party. There will be no NBA-sanctioned events open to the public and we strongly encourage promoters, clubs, bars, etc. not to host events in the city related to this game.""  We rate the Facebook post False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDCEBB40>],/factchecks/2021/mar/01/facebook-posts/no-atlantas-mayor-not-shutting-down-city-nba-all-s/

Budd says 9% of stimulus targets COVID, the rest is 'not even' related
","A North Carolina congressman claims the Democrats’ proposed stimulus plan has very little to do with the coronavirus. The ""American Rescue Plan"" calls for $1.9 trillion in spending.  ""There’s about 9% of it actually going to COVID, meaning 91% of it is not even COVID-related,"" Republican. Rep. Ted Budd said in a speech, which he tweeted. Is Budd right about those percentages? The first part of Budd’s quote is accurate. Expert analysis shows a small percentage of the spending is directed at combating the virus through vaccines, protective equipment or resources for health care providers. But that doesn’t mean the rest of the bill isn’t related to COVID-19. A significant percentage of the bill aims to address the financial fallout caused by the pandemic. Experts we spoke with put the bill’s spending into three categories: coronavirus containment, things that are tightly or loosely related to the pandemic, and things that shouldn’t be considered related at all. Let’s look first at spending that directly targets COVID-containment. Depending on how COVID-containment is measured, the cost ranges between $100 billion and $160 billion.  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group focused on reducing federal deficits, put COVID-19 ""containment"" efforts at $110 billion, or 6% of the bill. The group put vaccine-related activities in a separate group costing about $17 billion, less than 1% of the entire bill.  For his part, President Joe Biden said $160 billion would go towards COVID-19 testing, protective gear, vaccine production and distribution. Even if we take this higher number, that would mean the funds directed to fight COVID account for roughly 8.4% of the $1.9 trillion.  That means the first part of Budd’s claim is nearly spot-on. But the second part of his claim is off-base. While a lot of the proposed spending doesn’t directly go toward combating COVID, that doesn’t mean it’s not related to the coronavirus.  A significant portion is designed to offer economic relief to businesses and people affected by the pandemic. Perhaps the most famous part of the plan, direct stimulus payments to individuals, is estimated to cost more than $420 billion. The plan would also extend unemployment benefits and offer financial aid to help schools reopen.  Erica York at the Tax Foundation and Stan Veuger at the American Enterprise Institute both described economic relief efforts as ""COVID-related."" ""Whether you think they’re wise or not, they’re clearly a response to the economic crisis,"" Veuger said in a phone interview. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reported that $246 billion would go toward extending unemployment benefits through August and raising the federal supplement payment — a move that would account for roughly 13% of the budget. The Congressional Budget Office also said the proposed unemployment benefits would cost $246 billion. The unemployment benefits, combined with a $400-a-week supplement to state unemployment insurance payments, would cost a combined $350 billion, PolitiFact reported. The CRFB reported that $130 billion, or 7%, would go toward helping schools reopen safely. We asked Budd whether he believes the extension of unemployment benefits is unrelated to the COVID-19 crisis. Spokesman Curtis Kalin didn’t directly answer the question. He said Budd wants to reopen the country. For aid, he said the federal government could use the $1 trillion that hasn’t been spent yet — a claim we’ve rated Half True. To be clear, the bill does include proposals that experts don’t necessarily see as pertinent. ""The Democratic proposal is going beyond what we’ve seen in past relief measures by significantly expanding existing tax credits and making changes to the international tax system,"" York said.  ""For instance, lawmakers are proposing expanding the child tax credit,"" she said. ""Opponents might argue that’s wish list and isn’t a speedy form of relief, but proponents might argue it’s COVID-related because the pandemic and downturn have disproportionately affected lower-income households and so policies are being targeted toward the affected populations."" In total, the CRFB estimates the House Democrats’ relief package includes ""at least $312 billion of policies that have little to do with the current crisis."" The group cited the $110 billion to expand the Child Tax Credit and $50 billion to expand health care access through the Affordable Care Act. The CRFB proposed alternative plans costing $1.3 trillion and $1.1 trillion, respectively. Meanwhile, a group of Republican senators proposed a $600 billion plan.  Budd said about 9% of Biden’s stimulus plan ""is actually going to COVID, meaning 91% of it is not even COVID-related."" In the first part of his statement, Budd accurately describes the proposed spending on efforts to combat the virus itself.  However, he’s wrong to suggest the rest of the bill isn’t related to COVID-19 at all. He may disagree with how much the bill would spend on unemployment insurance and other financial relief efforts. But the bill does aim to address the financial cost of the pandemic. His statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB99E040>],/factchecks/2021/mar/01/ted-budd/budd-says-9-stimulus-targets-covid-rest-not-even-r/
"['Health Check', 'Tom Cotton']","
Becerra’s a longtime single-payer supporter. That doesn’t mean it will happen if he’s HHS secretary.
","A digital ad running in Georgia and New Hampshire says that Xavier Becerra, President Joe Biden’s nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, supports ""Medicare for All."" ""Becerra supports Bernie’s government takeover of your health care, eliminating your employer provided coverage,"" the narrator says. The ad, funded by the campaign PAC of Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), is part of a blitz from conservative groups against Becerra’s confirmation. It first aired this week and will continue until the Senate’s confirmation vote. The gritty, foreboding ad includes a range of other attacks, including criticisms of California’s Covid-19 response and Becerra’s role in legal cases on reproductive rights. Another ad, this one funded by Heritage Action for America and airing in the Washington, D.C., market, uses similar talking points, including Becerra’s support for ""government-run health care."" Becerra underwent two Senate hearings this week in which he faced questions about his support for Medicare for All. ""Your long-standing support for single-payer, government-run health care seems hostile to our current system from my perspective,"" Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) said during Wednesday’s Senate Finance Committee hearing. ""What assurances can you give to Americans who currently have private insurance, including through Medicare Advantage, and are satisfied with their insurance provider that they will not lose their coverage in the future to some sort of Medicare for All approach or federal takeover of health care?"" Becerra responded that he was asked to serve at the pleasure of Biden, who has made it clear he wants to build on the Affordable Care Act. ""That will be my mission,"" he said. Since a vote on Becerra’s nomination could happen next week, we thought it was important to check the claim from this ad and give context to what power HHS secretaries actually have. We reached out to Cotton’s press team to ask for evidence to support the ad but didn’t hear back. The ad does cite a December New York Times article with the headline ""Becerra Supports ‘Medicare for All’ and Could Help States Get There"" to back up the claim. Noah Weinrich, press secretary for Heritage Action for America, did provide evidence of Becerra’s support for Medicare for All. Weinrich sent clips of press interviews, as well as links to House of Representatives Medicare for All bills that Becerra co-sponsored over his years in Congress. Xavier Becerra was elected as a Democrat to represent a Los Angeles district in the U.S. House in 1993. He stayed in Congress 24 years. He resigned in 2017 to accept the position of attorney general of California, which was offered to him by then-Gov. Jerry Brown. As attorney general, Becerra brought more than 100 legal challenges against the Trump administration for various health, environmental and immigration issues. One of his best-known lawsuits was in support of the Affordable Care Act. California took the lead with 18 other states in arguing against overturning the law before the U.S. Supreme Court. That decision is expected by the end of June. Since Becerra was first elected to Congress, he has been an advocate for single-payer, or universal, health coverage. This type of coverage can take many forms, but by most definitions, it means the federal government would have some role in funding and administering health insurance for the public. ""I do, as I said before, join my colleagues who support the single-payer plan,"" Becerra said during a congressional hearing in 1994. ""For me, meaningful health care reform means that we must have universal coverage. We must have portability. We must have choice of provider."" More recently, this approach took on the moniker of Medicare for All, in reference to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) health care bill with the same name. Sanders’ bill, first introduced in 2017, was designed to eliminate private health insurance after phasing in government-run health care, funded by raising taxes. In 2017, Becerra said he would ""absolutely"" support Sanders’ bill. ""I've been a supporter of Medicare for All for the 24 years that I was in Congress,"" Becerra said during a Fox News interview. ""This year, as attorney general, I would fight for that if we had an opportunity to put that forward in the state of California, because I think what we do is we give people that certainty that they're going to be able to access a doctor or a hospital."" And in 2019, Becerra told KHN’s Samantha Young he’s ""been a single-payer advocate all my life."" Reviewing Becerra’s statements, it’s clear he does support Medicare for All or similar plans. But, if confirmed as head of the Department of Health and Human Services, Becerra will be a member of Biden’s Cabinet, and the president dictates policy priorities. During the Democratic presidential primaries, Biden was unwavering in his opposition to Medicare for All, instead throwing his support behind implementing a public option health plan and expanding the ACA.  A public option is a government-run health insurance plan that would exist beside private health insurance coverage as a choice in the ACA marketplace. It’s also important to note that while the ad says Becerra supports Medicare for All, thus ""eliminating your employer-provided coverage,"" that doesn’t mean your health insurance would be eliminated. Rather, it would be replaced by government-run health insurance. ""The notion that by having Medicare for All you’re going to lose insurance coverage is bizarre,"" said Mark A. Peterson, a professor of public policy, political science and law at UCLA. ""The whole point of Medicare for All is that everyone has health insurance."" Since Biden doesn’t support Medicare for All, would Becerra’s stance really matter? No, said Joseph Antos, a health care scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. ""He will not be able to, in this role, push the executive branch or the Congress in this direction in any perceptible way,"" said Antos. ""About all he could really do is use the waiver process and loosen up the various restrictions that the Trump administration tried to impose on states in the Medicaid programs. But that’s not the same thing as single-payer."" Antos was referring to waivers that states can ask for in order to change how they administer the ACA exchanges or Medicaid. Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, said it certainly is possible Becerra could be called upon to consider state waiver proposals to implement single-payer systems. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.) ""He would likely look more favorably on waivers like that than the Trump administration, which was quite clear they wouldn’t consider them. He might also view such waivers more positively than an HHS secretary that has not supported Medicare for All,"" Levitt wrote in an email. ""However, Becerra would not be making decisions on state waivers of such consequence unilaterally. He would certainly consult with the White House."" Levitt added that it seems unlikely at this point any state could implement a single-payer system. Vermont dropped its efforts to do so after it became clear how much taxes would increase. California does have significant support for single-payer but, at this point, it seems unlikely to be realized in that state. Plus, establishing a national single-payer system would require the support of both the president and Congress — and neither is ideologically there. The White House maintains Becerra would be focused solely on Biden’s priorities and not Medicare for All. Andrew Bates, a transition spokesperson for Biden, said in a statement that ""Xavier Becerra will support and work to enact President Biden's health care agenda — building on the ACA with a public option — as was made clear immediately after he was selected."" But Heritage Action’s Weinrich took a different view: ""The HHS secretary holds considerable policy-making and rule-making power, and Becerra's long record indicates he would use that power to expand government's role in health care in any way he can, with the ultimate goal of a single-payer option."" In the 2018 and 2020 elections, it was common for Republicans to paint Democrats as ""socialists."" Sometimes this was illustrated through their support for Medicare for All or simply being from California. The same rhetoric is being employed here, said Peterson. ""That Biden, by bringing in these officials from California, and the fact that Nancy Pelosi is speaker of the House, they’re arguing it’s just showing the infiltration of the radical socialist California state into the federal government,"" he said. ""But this is ridiculous, because there are not socialist politics, per se, happening in California, and often the California Democrats in Washington are moderate."" Ultimately though, the goal of an ad like this is to lay the groundwork for future campaigns. ""In a Senate that is split 50-50 and that 50th Democrat is a conservative Democrat, there is opportunity and leverage for Republicans to try and stand in the way,"" said Peterson. ""The less effective the Biden administration can be, the more effective campaigning will be for Republicans."" The ad states, ""Becerra supports Bernie’s government takeover of your health care, eliminating your employer-provided coverage."" Becerra’s past remarks illustrate he does support Medicare for All or other programs in which the government would run and fund health insurance. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD8BE00>],/factchecks/2021/mar/01/tom-cotton/becerras-longtime-single-payer-supporter-doesnt-me/

Tom Cotton falsely claims Joe Biden halted the deportation of criminals
","Speaking at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., criticized Democrats’ immigration proposals and claimed that President Joe Biden was giving terrorists and other criminals a pass to stay in the country even if they were here illegally. ""They have halted deportations for all illegal aliens — murderers, rapists, terrorists, MS-13 gang members are not being deported,"" Cotton told CPAC attendees Feb. 26 in Orlando. Is Cotton right about criminals being allowed to stay? No. His claim ignores the policies of the Department of Homeland Security. ""Sen. Cotton misspoke,"" with respect to terrorists not being deported, James Arnold, a spokesperson for Cotton, told PolitiFact. On Jan. 20, David Pekoske, then-acting secretary of homeland security, ordered a review of immigration enforcement practices and an immediate 100-day pause on the deportation of people with final orders of removal.  ""Due to limited resources, DHS cannot respond to all immigration violations or remove all persons unlawfully in the United States,"" Pekoske said. ""Rather, DHS must implement civil immigration enforcement based on sensible priorities and changing circumstances."" The deportation pause did not apply to people who had engaged or were suspected of engaging in terrorism or espionage, or posed a danger to national security and public safety.  People were still eligible for deportation if they were in prison or jail and released on or after the date of Pekoske’s memo, and if they were convicted of an aggravated felony. An aggravated felony includes murder, rape or sexual abuse of a minor. Cotton also left out that a federal judge in Texas has since blocked the deportation moratorium indefinitely. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the Biden administration over the deportation pause. DHS told PolitiFact that Cotton’s claim was incorrect, noting that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Feb. 18 issued interim operating guidance that said removal resources would focus on threats to national security, border security and public safety.  ""Individuals are presumed to be a threat to public safety if, for example, they have been convicted of an aggravated felony or engaged in certain activity as part of a criminal gang or transnational criminal organization and there is reason to believe they currently pose a threat,"" ICE said. We don’t have data on how many murderers, rapists, gang members or terrorists have been deported during the Biden administration. But it is inaccurate to say that their deportations were halted. Cotton said, ""They have halted deportations for all illegal aliens, murderers, rapists, terrorists, MS-13 gang members are not being deported."" Biden’s administration ordered a 100-day deportation pause, but it did not apply to criminals such as murderers, rapists, terrorists or gang members.  We rate Cotton’s claim False.

Fact-checking whether Democrats’ ‘wish list’ is in $1.9 trillion relief bill
","An attack ad claims that the American Rescue Plan includes money for a bridge connecting Canada to New York, an underground rail project in Silicon Valley, museums and Native American language preservation, Amtrak, environmental justice grants and family planning organizations like Planned Parenthood. The ad is in response to President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan for tackling COVID-19 and related economic challenges. It includes a $1,400-a-person stimulus payment, enhanced unemployment insurance, and a boost for coronavirus vaccination and testing efforts. It’s also loaded with pork, according to a group founded by Nikki Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and potential contender for the presidency in 2024. The attack is made in a Facebook post from Stand for America and is headlined, ""Democrats’ COVID ‘Stimulus’ Bill Wishlist."" It lists six figures, ranging from $1.5 million to $1.5 billion, for spending on things such as underground rail, Amtrak, Native American language preservation, environmental justice and family planning.   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) H.R.1319 does include some of the projects as described, but the post lacks context. For example, the largest of the six — $1.5 billion for Amtrak — was also requested by the Trump administration to help the railroad operate during the pandemic. Stephen Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, points out that the amounts in the post account for about $2.2 billion of the $1.9 trillion bill, or about 0.1%. We sent messages to Stand for America via Facebook and its website asking for information to back up the Facebook post, but did not get a reply. Correct. But the Trump administration made the same request. The bill would give $1.5 million to the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corp. ""to prevent, prepare for and respond to coronavirus by conducting the operations, maintenance and capital infrastructure activities of the Seaway International Bridge,"" which connects New York State and Ontario. In May 2020, the Transportation Department asked for the same amount of money for the bridge because toll revenue had ""dramatically decreased"" due to decreased traffic from the pandemic, the New York Daily News reported. ""$100 million for underground rail project in Silicon Valley"" Correct. The bill allots $1.25 billion for federal transit capital investment grants. It does not specify a project in the Silicon Valley.  Stand for America cites a Fox Business news article that says the language of the bill alludes to $112 million going to phase two of the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) expansion. The Washington Post also reported that it’s estimated the expansion will receive about $112 million. The long-planned six-mile extension would include five miles in a subway beneath downtown San Jose, with construction expected to start in 2022 and the line carrying passengers in 2030, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The newspaper says the project’s stimulus funding would be $141 million. ""$500 million for museums & Native American language preservation"" Largely correct. The bill ""would appropriate $480 million for grants to fund activities related to the arts, humanities, libraries and museums, and Native American language preservation and maintenance,"" according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The bill appropriates the $480 million this way:  $270 million — split between the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts — to provide grants ""to prevent, prepare for, respond to and recover from the coronavirus."" $200 million to the Institute of Museum and Library Services to carry out the Library Services and Technology Act. $10 million in ""emergency grants"" to ""ensure the survival and continuing vitality of Native American languages during and after the (COVID-19) public health emergency."" Museums have been financially disadvantaged by COVID-19, according to a survey of 850 museum directors by the American Alliance of Museums. The Metropolitan Museum of Art recently made news when its director said it was considering selling artwork to cover operational expenses. ""$1.5 billion for Amtrak, which still has $1 billion in unspent aid"" The $1.5 billion is correct. But it follows similar aid provided by the Trump administration. (The articles that Stand for America cites don’t address whether Amtrak has unspent aid.) The bill would steer grants totaling $1.5 billion to the National Railroad Passenger Corp. (Amtrak) ""to prevent, prepare for and respond to coronavirus"": $820.4 million for the northeast corridor and $679.6 million for the national network. In April 2020, Trump’s transportation department announced it was making more than $1 billion available to Amtrak ""to support the railroad’s activities to prevent, prepare for and respond to the spread of"" COVID-19. ""$50 million for environmental justice grants"" Correct. The bill appropriates to the Environmental Protection Agency $50 million for ""grants, contracts and other agency activities that implement the environmental justice purposes and objectives"" described in ""Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations,"" an executive order signed by President Bill Clinton in 1994; and President Joe Biden’s ""Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad"" executive order.  Biden’s order amended Clinton’s order to create a White House Environmental Justice Interagency Council to ""develop a strategy to address current and historic environmental injustice."" ""$50 million for ‘family planning’ orgs like Planned Parenthood"" Largely correct. The bill appropriates $50 million ""for making grants and contracts under"" the Public Health Service Act, which gives grants and contracts for family planning.  No organization is specified. The National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association issued a statement praising the $50 million for Title X. We rated as a Promise Kept Trump’s pledge to defund Planned Parenthood. His administration enacted a rule that effectively said that any facility receiving federal Title X funding cannot also be an abortion provider. Previously, abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood could receive Title X funds as long as the funds were only used for non-abortion services. Biden on Jan. 28 directed the Health and Human Services Department to consider whether to rescind the rule. A Facebook post claimed: ""Democrats’ COVID ‘stimulus’ bill wish list"" includes money ""for a bridge connecting Canada to New York""; an ""underground rail project in Silicon Valley""; museums and ""Native American language preservation"";  Amtrak; ""environmental justice grants""; and ""‘family planning’ organizations like Planned Parenthood."" The figures listed in the post for six components of Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief bill are largely accurate. But the post needs additional information.

How much did New York’s revenue suffer in the pandemic year?
","How has New York state fared in collecting revenue during the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic turmoil?  Not so badly, according to Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who said recently that New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has been exaggerating the fiscal hit to his state. In a Feb. 7 interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd on ""Meet the Press on Feb. 7, Cassidy was asked about what actions the Senate needs to take to help state and local governments experiencing fiscal shortfalls in the wake of the pandemic. Cassidy acknowledged that some states have faced budgetary difficulties, but said others have not, including Democratic-run states such as New York. ""New York, for all of their complaining, Gov. Cuomo's complaining, has only had a 1.5% decrease in revenue,"" Cassidy said. The remarks came amid skirmishing between the parties over President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. The bill is designed to boost the response to the coronavirus pandemic and aid the economic recovery.  Biden’s proposal envisioned $350 billion in state and local government aid, but many Republicans have been skeptical of aiding cities and states without more conditions. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo speaks at the opening of a mass COVID-19 vaccination site in Queens, N.Y., on Feb. 24, 2021. (AP) Has New York’s fiscal hit really been that modest? Ty Bofferding, Cassidy’s director of communications, pointed to a report by the financial institution J.P. Morgan that showed that in the calendar year 2020, New York had an aggregate tax revenue decline of 1.5% compared with 2019. While Cuomo’s administration did not dispute the 1.5% figure, they argue that the calendar year figures are less useful for tracking the pandemic’s budgetary impact than the fiscal year figures, which run from April 1 through March 31. In 2020, January, February and part of March occurred before the pandemic hit. ""Comparing calendar years, as the chart the senator is referencing does, fails to recognize the impact of the pandemic on state revenues,"" said Freeman Klopott, a spokesman for the New York state Division of the Budget. ""Almost the entirety of the first quarter of the calendar year 2020 was un-impacted by the pandemic and growing robustly."" In other words, the state argues, the calendar-year totals undercount the fiscal harm from the pandemic. ""Unlike the federal government, New York State must balance its budget, and it must do it on a fiscal year basis,"" Klopott said. ""We can’t change the timing."" The J.P. Morgan report, which focused on advice to investors in municipal bonds, cautioned that its conclusions are ""based on the current data, and are not indicative of future revenues, particularly given the uncertainties on the progress of the pandemic."" Meanwhile, New York state has projected a significantly larger revenue shortfall for the full fiscal year. A baseline budget from January 2020 projected state revenue of $87.9 billion for the year ending March 31, 2021, said Laura Schultz, executive director of research at the State University of New York’s Rockefeller Institute of Government. But by April 2020, after the impact of the pandemic started to become clear, the state revised its projection to $77.7 billion. That would be an 11.6% decline from the earlier projection, and a 6.2% drop from what was collected in the previous fiscal year.  Those numbers are significantly larger than the 1.5% decrease, though final revenue figures won’t be available until after the end of the fiscal year. Cassidy said that ""New York, for all of their complaining, Gov. Cuomo's complaining, has only had a 1.5% decrease in revenue"" due to the pandemic. New York state saw revenue decline by 1.5% in calendar year 2020. However, the state’s budget is based on a fiscal year that runs from April 1 to March 31, and the calendar year figure Cassidy cited includes nearly three months of relatively normal, pre-pandemic economic activity. This makes it a misleading indicator of the pandemic’s budgetary impact. In fact, state budget officials have already projected larger revenue declines for the full fiscal year.

Receiving COVID-19 vaccine does not enroll you in a government tracking system or medical experiment
","A viral video shows a doctor accusing the U.S. government of testing out COVID-19 vaccines on the general population and involuntarily entering recipients into a tracking system.  ""If you take the vaccine, you'll be enrolled in a pharmacovigilance tracking system. It means that you've enrolled yourself in a medical trial,"" the doctor says. ""This pharmacovigilance tracking system tracks you for two years. It’s set up by the Department of Defense. It was handed off to Oracle and Google to put the data together."" The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The doctor is Simone Gold, a founder of America’s Frontline Doctors, a group that became famous for voicing coronavirus conspiracy theories. Gold herself has spread misinformation in the past, and she was recently charged for participating in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.  According to the Medical Board of California, Gold holds an active medical license. She specializes in emergency medicine and general practice. However, many of her assertions about the COVID-19 vaccines are misleading or downright wrong.  There is no evidence that receiving the COVID-19 vaccine enrolls people in a government tracking program, as Gold suggests, and clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of the vaccines were done before they were approved for emergency use.  We reached out to Gold for comment but didn’t hear back.  Clinics do report vaccinations to state databases to help with distribution and allow healthcare providers to keep track of immunizations. However, Gold’s claim that getting vaccinated automatically enrolls people into a government tracking system is misleading.  State vaccine registries allow public health and healthcare providers to confirm that the vaccines are being properly distributed. Since both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses to be maximally effective, the databases also help providers ensure that vaccinated people receive their recommended second dose on schedule.  This data wouldn’t be used to allow the government to track people, said Kelly Moore, deputy director of the Immunization Action Coalition.  ""These systems are not typically used for post-authorization safety surveillance,"" said Moore. ""Any use of data from these systems outside the purpose of direct patient care would be done with de-identified data (no personal information) and would be subject to research review and approval processes."" The ""tracking system"" that Gold references explicitly is an online system run by Oracle that is being used to help the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keep track of vaccine logistics and distribution. According to Oracle, anonymized data from the system will be used for ""analysis and reporting by authorized agencies and organizations.""  Another part of the CDC system is ""v-safe,"" a smartphone-based vaccine safety program that allows vaccine recipients to report any adverse side effects to the CDC.  Moore confirmed that enrollment in the v-safe program is voluntary, not mandatory as Gold claims. The CDC and Oracle have also confirmed to other fact-checkers that participation in the program is optional.  In addition, signing up to receive a COVID-19 vaccine does not automatically enroll a patient in an experimental medical trial. Vaccine trials are used to test the safety and efficacy of vaccines before they are rolled out to the public. The COVID-19 vaccines have already been subject to these studies, which involved tens of thousands of volunteers.  To receive emergency-use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna had to follow up with at least half of the participants for at least two months after they received their vaccinations to check for any negative effects.  Gold said, ""If you take the vaccine, you'll be enrolled in a pharmacovigilance tracking system. It means that you've enrolled yourself in a medical trial."" Anonymized data from a CDC system will be used to help federal agencies keep track of vaccine distribution, not the people who are vaccinated. Another optional part of the system will allow vaccine recipients to report any adverse side effects. Trials to test the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines were done before they were approved for emergency use. Signing up to receive the COVID-19 vaccine does not automatically enroll a patient in a clinical trial.  We rate this claim False.   ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB71800>],/factchecks/2021/feb/26/simone-gold/receiving-covid-19-does-not-enroll-you-government-/

So we checked the record. (Screenshot from Facebook) Nadler, who is Jewish and who represents one of the nation’s most heavily Jewish districts, didn’t say that. Rather, he pushed back against comments from a Republican colleague about the role of the government in prohibiting discrimination against LGBTQ people. On Feb. 25, the House passed the Equality Act. If signed into law, the legislation would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. During the debate proceeding the House vote, Nadler encouraged his colleagues to vote in favor of the Equality Act. ""This long overdue legislation will provide millions of LGBTQ Americans explcit protections from being denied medical care, fired from their jobs or thrown out of their homes simply because of who they are,"" he said. The Equality Act would supersede the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which set a higher bar for the government to defend laws that Americans said abridged their right to freedom of religion. In effect, private businesses would not be permitted to deny service to LGBTQ people by claiming it violates their religious beliefs. Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., criticized the Equality Act during the House debate, saying it violates Christian beliefs. ""The gender confusion that exists in our culture today is a clear rejection of God’s good design,"" he said. ""Whenever a nation's laws no longer reflect the standards of God, that nation is in rebellion against him and will inevitably bear the consequences."" Leaning into the constitutional separation of church and state, Nadler pushed back. ""Mr. Steube, what any religious tradition describes as God’s will is no concern of this Congress,"" he said.

The coronavirus vaccine doesn’t cause Alzheimer’s, ALS
","A research article making the rounds online claims that the COVID-19 vaccine could cause diseases like Alzheimer’s. Don’t believe it. In the article, published in the journal Microbiology & Infectious Diseases in January, J. Bart Classen wrote that components of the coronavirus vaccines may cause the misfolding of proteins associated with Alzheimer’s and Lou Gehrig’s disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ""The enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit,"" Classen said in the paper. The article was surfaced to PolitiFact by VineSight, a firm that tracks online misinformation. It has been shared widely on social media and blogs that advocate against vaccines, so we wanted to take a closer look. The research article is baseless — there is no evidence that the coronavirus vaccine causes Alzheimer’s, ALS or prion diseases. When we reached out to Classen for a comment, he said his paper ""speaks for itself."" Microbiology & Infectious Diseases is hosted by SciVision, a platform for open-access journals that librarian Jeffrey Beall listed as a potential predatory publisher aimed at profiting from academics instead of offering rigorous peer review. Classen has previously published research falsely linking vaccines to diabetes. He speculates on his website that the coronavirus pandemic ""is actually a bioweapon attack and may be linked to the U.S. anthrax attack of 2001."" He also included that claim — which PolitiFact has repeatedly debunked — in the body of his research article. Putting the bogus bioweapon claim aside, let’s take a closer look at Classen’s paper. Prion diseases are a family of rare neurodegenerative disorders. They’re caused by pathogens called prions, which can cause abnormal folding of proteins most commonly found in the brain. One example is mad cow disease, a brain disorder in cattle that can spread to humans through infected meat. The coronavirus vaccines use a new but well-researched technology called mRNA, which tells the body how to produce copies of the protein on the surface of the virus without infecting the patient. In his paper, Classen says mRNA vaccines may trigger the misfolding of proteins associated with Alzheimer’s and ALS, as well as prion diseases. His evidence? He doesn’t really say. All he includes is a three-sentence methods section summarizing an unspecified analysis of the coronavirus vaccine. In an article debunking Classen’s paper, the American Council on Science and Health, a nonprofit science advocacy organization, wrote that Classen’s paper lacks evidence and is ""entirely speculative."" ""How was (the vaccine) analyzed? What software was used? Did he examine any controls, like cellular mRNA sequences? He doesn't say,"" the organization wrote. RELATED: Deaths after vaccination don’t prove that COVID-19 vaccine is lethal The Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization to two coronavirus vaccines: one from Pfizer-BioNTech and one from Moderna. Clinical trials with tens of thousands of participants indicated no connection between the vaccines and neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s or ALS. Millions of Americans have received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines since they were approved. If they caused neurodegenerative or prion diseases, those instances would be documented in the federal government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System — but they’re not. ""VAERS has received no reports of prion-related diseases, Alzheimer's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) after COVID-19 vaccination,"" said Martha Sharan, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""No evidence to date indicates a causative association between COVID-19 vaccines and these conditions."" Classen’s claim is inaccurate and ridiculous.

Chart comparing New York and Florida on COVID-19 is flawed. Here’s why
","Who would have thought a global pandemic would only heighten a longstanding rivalry between Florida and New York? Tensions flared early in the COVID-19 outbreak when Florida issued restrictions on travelers from New York, then a raging hot spot for the virus. New York returned the favor in the summer, putting Florida travelers on its own quarantine list. Now, social media users are comparing the two states’ handling of the virus, sharing a pro-Florida Instagram post from an account called ""Unwoke Narrative"" that points to the states’ politically opposed governors as reasons for differences in state COVID-19 data.  Invoking the names of Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and New York’s Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a graphic titled ""Cuomo vs. DeSantis: How NY & FL Handled the Virus"" lists several COVID-19 figures for each state. ""Cuomo maintained strict lockdowns, crushing jobs and freedom,"" it says. ""DeSantis took the opposite route and rejected tyranny. Who was right?"" Spoiler alert: The graphic determines Florida is the winner ""even though Florida has a larger population,"" ""is disproportionately elderly"" and ""is visited by more potentially infected tourists.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It cites as sources the Washington Examiner, New York Post, NBC, Washington Post and Statista. The accompanying text points readers to a website with more information. Some of the numbers check out. The graphic is close, for example, on the spread between the states’ hospitalizations and vaccinations administered. But when we reviewed the overall claim, we found the broader comparison misleads by oversimplifying the relationship between the data and lockdown rules in each state.  Let’s take a look. The post’s most glaring omission, experts told us, was its lack of context about the pandemic’s timing and impact in the two states. ""New York was the epicenter of the pandemic last spring, long before Florida had significant numbers of cases,"" said Richard Mollot, executive director at the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a nonprofit focused on improving quality of care for people in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The virus hit New York early and hard, before there was enough access to personal protective equipment and before health officials or emergency room doctors and nurses knew much about the virus, including the best ways to treat and stabilize it.  The result was mass devastation and death. During that early stage, the state was averaging over 900 deaths a day. Dr. Marissa Levine, a professor of public health at the University of South Florida, said not only was New York’s experience unlike any other in the nation, but it also informed how the rest of the country would manage the pandemic. ""There’s no question that Florida hospitals were able to learn from what New York went through and benefited as a result,"" she said. Cuomo’s administration has faced intense scrutiny over its undercounting of COVID-19 nursing home deaths. New York’s attorney general released a Jan. 28 report that found the state had failed to report thousands of deaths. Hours later, the state’s health department added more than 3,800 deaths to the tally, each a resident whose hospital death had not been previously counted. Yes, New York is reporting higher numbers of COVID-19 deaths of nursing home and assisted living facility residents than Florida, but we couldn't find data that puts it as high as the graphic reports — 15,000+ in New York compared with 9,000+ in Florida. The latest state numbers from Feb. 4, which includes the hospitalization data, show about 13,300 have died in New York. Florida’s total is around 9,700. Priya Chidambaram, a senior policy analyst at Kaiser Family Foundation who has tracked the pandemic’s impact on long-term care facility residents, said the post is problematic because states collect and report data differently. ""They're not necessarily comparable,"" she said. ""Non-nursing home settings are defined differently in each state. The best way to compare is to look at recent trends in federal data.""  As of Feb. 7, such federal data showed New York had 10.1 positive COVID-19 cases per 1,000 nursing home residents, while Florida was at 6.3. When it came to deaths per 1,000 residents, New York was at 2.99 residents and Florida at 1.85. It’s important to note that the states don’t have comparable nursing home population numbers, at least as of 2019. New York was reporting about 19,000 more residents in certified nursing facilities than Florida, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data. The post is right that New York has had more deaths than Florida, even when accounting for population. The numbers it says it relies on are not far from what we saw recorded on Feb. 25, when New York was reporting about 247 deaths per 100,000 people compared with Florida’s 143.  But the metric again ignores New York’s unprecedented early peak and the ebb and flow of death rates across states over time. Daily deaths have surged in Florida at times when they remained low in New York, and vice versa. ""There’s a time factor here,"" Levine said. ""These pandemics are really epidemics that happen in different places at different times, and you have to really consider that when you’re doing comparisons.""  On April 14, for example, when the first wave peaked in New York, the state had a seven-day average of 39.3 deaths per 1 million residents while Florida was at 2.1, according to the COVID Tracking Project. On Aug. 16, Florida recorded a seven-day average 8.5 deaths per million people while New York was at 0.2. ""The implication is that the political decisions in Florida versus New York has led to those numbers, but I think that would be a very shallow interpretation of the data,"" said Dr. Thomas Tsai, an assistant professor in health policy and management at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""Lockdown measures do work."" PolitiFact previously found that some of the more strictly regulated states performed better than Florida, as of early December 2020. And a study that Tsai participated in that has been preliminarily accepted for publication found that first-wave lockdowns did result in a downtick in COVID-19 cases two weeks later. Daily case numbers provide a snapshot of how one state compares with another on any given day. And the post’s figures showing Florida had 7,400 daily cases as of Feb. 8 while New York was at 9,000 is in the ballpark with what we see in COVID Tracker data for that period. But the metric does not reflect additional data points that place New York in a better position than Florida: the number of people tested and each state’s rolling positivity average. It again ignores that there were times when daily cases were high in Florida when they were not in New York.   On Feb. 8, New York reported a 5.1% positivity rate, according to state data and Florida saw a 7% positivity rate. The seven-day average of positive cases for the week ending Feb. 8 show New York in a better position, too, with a 5.2% average compared with 8.3% in Florida. Job losses in New York over the course of the pandemic have outpaced Florida’s, but experts caution against making such comparisons.  The graphic shows over 1 million jobs lost in New York versus more than 400,000 in Florida, and that lines up with data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Florida’s economy, fueled by out-of-state tourism and service industries, was hit hard by the pandemic. But the impact on jobs may have been mitigated by its warm weather, which allowed for dining and other types of public gatherings and businesses to continue operating outdoors.  Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, said places that have faced longer-term economic challenges, like much of upstate New York, have lost more jobs in the pandemic. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the right-of-center American Action Forum, urged caution when comparing state economies, including adjusting for time periods when the states were having similar impacts from the virus and state policies. ""I’m not morally opposed to compare across states, but you do have to be careful to do the comparison in a fair way,"" he said. While Florida was able to keep its economy more open, it came at a cost. To better understand the balance between economic recovery and public health, MoneyGeek analyzed the rate of case growth and deaths versus the rate of jobs recovered using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Johns Hopkins.  Looking at job losses from February 2020 and measuring job gains in each state from the point of highest job loss to the point of highest recovery, the report found that red states like Florida ""recovered 35% more jobs than blue states — 65% compared to 48%. However, red-state recovery rates came at a higher price, with 99% more COVID-19 cases and 78% more deaths per recovered job than blue states."" Florida recorded 50 cases per 100 jobs recovered, according to the analysis, while New York recorded 19. An Instagram post says New York’s lockdown measures led to more death and economic destruction while Florida’s more open approach led to less. The post overstates the correlation between the numbers and lockdown rules. It leaves out important factors, including environment and public health initiatives, and ignores that the two states collect and report data differently. Most significantly, it ignores that New York City was the epicenter of the nation’s first wave, before doctors had the equipment, therapeutics and experience needed to fight the new disease. States like Florida were able to learn and benefit from New York’s experience. We rate this Mostly False. Correction, March 5, 2021: A subhead in this story has been updated to more precisely describe New York's position as one of the nation's earliest and hardest hit states in the COVID-19 pandemic.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EADFD800>],/factchecks/2021/feb/26/instagram-posts/chart-comparing-new-york-and-florida-covid-19-flaw/

Did HHS nominee Xavier Becerra sue nuns?
","Critics of Xavier Becerra, President Joe Biden’s pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, seized on a comment he made while testifying before the Senate Finance Committee. During the confirmation hearing, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., asked Becerra, who previously served as California’s attorney general, about his past work on cases involving abortion. ""As attorney general, you spent an inordinate amount of time and effort suing pro-life organizations like Little Sisters of the Poor, or trying to ease restrictions or expand abortion,"" Thune said, adding, ""I think the majority of the American people would not want their secretary of health and human services focused or fixated on expanding abortion when we’ve got all of these public health issues to deal with."" Becerra responded that he understands and respects that Americans have deeply held beliefs on abortion. He continued, ""By the way I have never sued a nun — any nuns. I have taken on the federal government, but I have never sued any affiliation of nuns, and my actions have always been directed at the federal agencies, because they have been trying to do things that are contrary to the law in California."" Becerra’s response drew fire from critics on the right, who pointed to years-long litigation between Becerra, representing the state of California, and the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic order. An official with the conservative Heritage Foundation tweeted, ""Wow: Xavier Becerra falsely claims twice, 'I have never sued any nuns.' The Little Sisters of the Poor would like a word."" The National Review was among those to call out Becerra’s claim. So did Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. 🚨Xavier Becerra is now claiming he didn't sue nuns because he wants to get confirmed. But Becerra did sue nuns. He repeatedly harassed the Little Sisters of the Poor. That's why he should be rejected by the Senate. https://t.co/QOtHvENnLx The reality is a bit murkier than either side would like to admit. Becerra didn’t ""sue"" the Little Sisters of the Poor, although as a representative of California, he was a plaintiff in long-running litigation against them. The case in question involved not abortion, as Thune claimed, but rather religious rights as they related to the Affordable Care Act. It was part of a series of lawsuits involving the law’s requirements that employer health plans offer free contraceptive coverage. In particular, the litigation revolved around whether sincerely held religious or moral objections to contraceptives would allow the employer to sidestep that requirement. The Little Sisters of the Poor’s interest in this litigation didn’t come out of left field. During the Obama administration, the Little Sisters had sued to be exempted from the rule, even though it did not fit the strict definition of an exempted religious group under the ACA. The case was eventually consolidated with several related cases and argued at the Supreme Court in the case Zubik v. Burwell in 2016. Several members of the order were present for oral arguments. The court eventually sent several of the consolidated cases back to lower courts for further consideration. Sisters with the Little Sisters of The Poor, including Sister Celestine, left, and Sister Jeanne Veronique, center, rally outside the Supreme Court on March 23, 2016. (AP) When the Trump administration broadened the religious exemptions in 2017, Becerra, as the top legal officer for California, challenged the new rule. Officially, the lawsuit was filed against the federal government, and the complaint did not specifically reference the Little Sisters of the Poor. In a statement to PolitiFact, the California attorney general’s office said that in the lawsuit California vs. Azar, Becerra ""sued the Trump administration to defend the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive coverage mandate,"" citing two Trump-era rules that allowed employers to deny coverage. ""By the Trump administration’s own assessment, these rules would have resulted in up to 130,000 women losing coverage."" As the case was working its way through the courts, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a conservative legal group, petitioned the court in November 2017 to make the Little Sisters of the Poor a co-defendant in the case alongside the federal government.  About a month later, the court allowed the Little Sisters to join the case as a defendant, though it said the group didn’t have an absolute right to be part of it. From this point on, documents related to the case referred to the state of California and several other states as ""plaintiffs,"" HHS Secretary Alex Azar and other federal officials as ""defendants,"" and the Little Sisters of the Poor and a few other allied groups as ""defendant-intervenors."" The front page of one legal filing shows Becerra by name facing off against the Little Sisters of the Poor.  The case worked its way through the courts, and a related Pennsylvania case that involved the Little Sisters eventually reached the Supreme Court in 2020. The justices ruled 7-2 that the Trump rule changes were valid and sent the California case back to a lower court for further consideration, where it remains today. The California attorney general’s office emphasized that Becerra only sued the federal government, not the Little Sisters of the Poor. The office argues that the Little Sisters’ involvement was thrust upon them by the court, not something the office sought out.  Biden transition spokesperson Andrew Bates took the same position. Merritt E. McAlister, a University of Florida law professor, said Becerra had a reasonable point about not having sued the Little Sisters. Becerra ""brought a suit that would affect their religious rights, in their view, but that suit was brought against the federal government, and the Little Sisters inserted themselves into the case, with the court’s permission, because they were interested in protecting their rights, even though the court said the federal government could more than adequately do that for them,"" she said. But Ryan Colby, associate communications director at the Becket Fund, said this distinction is too cute.  ""After the Sisters got into the case and he beat them in lower court, Becerra dragged them all the way to the Supreme Court where he lost 7-2,"" Colby said. ""He's literally still fighting them in court today after that loss."" As some Twitter users have noted, the Little Sisters of the Poor aren’t technically ""nuns."" They’re ""sisters.""  ""Nuns live a cloistered life in a monastery and live a contemplative lifestyle — a life of prayer,"" said Margaret McGuinness, a professor of religion and theology at La Salle University. ""Sisters live and work in the world, although prayer is a very important component in their lives."" That said, McGuiness added that ""in ordinary usage, sisters and nuns are used interchangeably."" Becerra said, ""I have never sued a nun — any nuns."" As California attorney general, Becerra did not initiate a lawsuit against the Little Sisters of the Poor. However, the lawsuit he did initiate, which targeted the federal government, involved an issue on which the Little Sisters had long been a litigant — and after a court allowed the Little Sisters to intervene as a defendant in the case, Becerra continued to litigate directly against them in court.

Wind subsidies aren't 'pushing out' nuclear, natural gas investments
","U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Houston, was one of several Texas Republicans casting blame for the state's blackouts this month as millions of Texans huddled in their frigid homes. As with many other Republicans and conservative pundits, Crenshaw pointed his finger at wind energy as the primary culprit. But in a Feb. 16 tweet thread, Crenshaw expanded criticism beyond frozen wind turbines to include the federal subsidies for the wind industry and ""force the grid to rely in part on wind as a power source."" ""Why don’t we have extra gas power when we need it most?"" Crenshaw tweeted. ""Because years of federal subsidies for wind has caused an over reliance on wind and an under-investment in new gas and nuclear plants.""  ""Subsidizing investment in wind has pushed gas and nuclear out,"" he said.  There’s no doubt that wind energy now plays a major role in supplying Texas and the U.S. with power. In Texas, wind has grown from supplying 11% of the state’s energy demand to 23% over the last five years. It is now the state’s second-largest energy resource after natural gas.    In the U.S., wind accounted for 7% of all energy generation and was the nation's fourth-largest energy resource in 2019 after natural gas, coal and nuclear, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. It’s accurate to say that renewable energy subsidies over the last two decades have stoked investments in wind energy, said Bernadette Johnson, an energy economist with Enverus.   ""Those underpin every major renewable investment in the country,"" Johnson said.  But is it true that gas and nuclear energy sources across the U.S. have been ""pushed"" out, and that federal wind subsidies are to blame?  For nearly 200 years, federal subsidies have supported energy generation and infrastructure for all resources, according to a 2018 report from the University of Texas Energy Institute. For instance, in the 1800s the federal government leased timber stands and coal deposits to energy companies at generously low rates. In the 20th century, various tax policies sought to promote domestic oil and gas production. And in the 1950s, former President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s Atoms for Peace program funneled billions of dollars into nuclear energy development.  Before the turn of the century, fossil fuel industries accounted for up to 70% of the total cost of energy tax breaks. It wasn’t until around 2008 that renewable energy sources became the primary benefactor of federal support. ""Where once the government targeted energy production generally, it has shifted its spending focus towards cleaner, lower-carbon sources,"" Energy Institute researchers wrote. Generally, subsidies are defined as direct payments from the government to energy producers and measures like tax abatements.  The most popular subsidy program from which wind energy producers benefit is the production tax credit, which was initially introduced in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Production tax credits reduce a wind producer’s tax burden by a certain amount for every megawatt-hour of energy produced. In 2016, compensation was set at $23 per megawatt hour, although that amount ratchets down over a 10-year period.   Wind energy producers also benefited from another federal program that reimbursed developers 30% of their capital costs in lieu of a tax credit. Known as Section 1603 cash grants, the program was introduced in 2009 and distributed $25.7 billion to green energy projects before it expired three years later. Between 2010 and 2013, Energy Institute researchers found that federal wind energy subsidies jumped from $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion annually thanks to the Section 1603 grants. Following the program's expiration, however, federal wind subsidies dropped to $2.7 billion in 2016 then were projected to climb back up to $4.6 billion by 2019.  Meanwhile, hydrocarbon-based energy producers, mostly including natural gas, also have enjoyed their share of federal subsidies — from $3.1 billion in 2010 to a projected $6.2 billion in 2019, mostly through production tax abatements. Subsidies for nuclear sources over the last decade have remained relatively steady at around $1.3 billion annually. The amount of energy produced by wind and natural gas sources across the country have both increased. Energy produced by wind turbines has tripled over the last decade, while the energy produced by natural gas-fired plants has increased by 60% over the same period, according to federal data.  Nuclear energy, on the other hand, has remained relatively steady over the last 10 years at around 800,000 megawatts per year.   Nuclear technology hasn’t attracted significant investment in years, since before wind power gained a foothold in the energy market.  According to federal data, no new nuclear generation units have been added in the last two decades — hence nuclear energy’s relatively flat generation output since 2001. Eight nuclear generation units have been retired since 2013, federal data shows.  But nuclear’s flattened investment curve isn’t primarily due to the growing prevalence of renewable technologies. Rather, a 2017 U.S. Department of Energy Staff Report issued under former Secretary Rick Perry lists cheap natural gas as the ""biggest contributor"" to nuclear and coal plant retirements.  ""Production costs of coal and nuclear plants remained somewhat flat, while the new and existing, more flexible, and relatively lower-operating cost natural gas plants drove down wholesale market prices to the point that some formerly profitable nuclear and coal facilities began operating at a loss,"" the 2017 report says.  The ""lower variable operating costs"" of renewable resources is listed as one of three other factors adding pressure to the nuclear energy sector. Other challenges include low growth in electricity demand and regulatory costs. The heyday for natural gas investments peaked in the early 2000s after energy markets in Texas and elsewhere deregulated and natural gas technologies made significant efficiency improvements. Between 2001 and 2003, the U.S. added nearly 900 gas-fired electric generation units to the grid, according to federal data.   ""That's the only time in the history of power plants in the U.S. that there was anywhere close to that much installation of any capacity. That was the highest rate of investment ever,"" said Carey King, assistant director and research scientist at the University of Texas Energy Institute. Since then, gas-fired generator additions have remained relatively steady with investors adding new generation units in some years and retiring old units in others.   According to experts, these trends don’t demonstrate a causal relationship between wind subsidies and diminishing investments in natural gas, or, in Crenshaw’s terms, that wind subsidies are pushing out traditional resources.  ""There is no pushing out investment,"" King said. ""That statement is not correct in the sense that there is not a quantity of investment that everybody knows is going to happen and then suddenly doesn't happen. That's not a known number.""  Johnson, the energy economist, says that it’s common for renewable and natural gas generators to be built in tandem — both serving complimentary roles in a grid’s reliability. While wind turbines generate electricity according to intermittent wind patterns, gas-fired facilities can be fired up and ratcheted down during wind-less periods.  ""Generally where you see renewables being built out you see natural gas-fired generation growing because natural gas is the best backstop against renewables,"" she said. ""You can turn on a gas plant pretty quickly, you can ramp it up quickly. It's much more reactive and flexible compared to coal or anything else.""  Crenshaw’s office did not respond to a request for comment.  Federal subsidies have been a boon to wind energy producers over the last several years. In a Feb. 16 tweet threat, Crenshaw said that these subsidies are pushing out investments in traditional energy resources like natural gas and nuclear, and that this transition led to the energy crisis Texas experienced during the February winter storm. With regard to nuclear energy, a U.S. Department of Energy report lists the low cost of natural gas as the primary challenge to the nuclear industry, which has remained relatively steady since before wind subsidies became popular.  With regard to natural gas, the number of gas-fired units also has remained relatively steady since a massive build-up in the early 2000s. But experts say that it’s difficult to identify wind subsidies as the primary driver behind investments in natural gas generation.  We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCBC9C0>],/factchecks/2021/feb/26/dan-crenshaw/wind-subsidies-arent-pushing-out-nuclear-natural-g/

Joe Biden stumbled over his words in a recent speech
","Social media users and some conservative commentators have recently shared posts that claim President Joe Biden used an offensive and derogatory slur. In the title of a Facebook video, a pair of conservative commentators known as the Hodgetwins assert Biden said a racial slur. A YouTube video that draws on the same clip of Biden speaking says the same in its headline. These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video footage of Biden in the posts is authentic, from a Feb. 19 address Biden gave at a virtual meeting of the Munich Security Conference. During the speech, Biden, who has a stutter, stumbled over the words ""I’m eager to hear."" The third time he said eager, it sounded like he put an ""n"" at the front of ""eager."" This is what the posts are referring to as a racial slur. You can hear it at the 16:32 mark in this C-SPAN video, when Biden said: ""Look, the range of challenges Europe and the United States must take on together is broad and complex. And I’m eager to hear, I’m eager to hear, I’m eager to hear next, from my good friends and outstanding leaders, Chancellor Merkel, about her thoughts on the way forward."" A transcript of Biden’s remarks published by the White House reflects this: ""And I’m eager to hear — I’m eager to hear — I’m eager to hear next from…""  About 2 minutes and 55 seconds into their video about the stumble, one of the Hodgetwins acknowledged that Biden was not trying to say a racial slur: ""Hey, Joe, you can at least apologize, man. I mean I know you didn’t intentionally say it but how do you get confused with the word eager...?"" But for social media users clicking through their feeds and seeing headlines that say the president said a racial slur, that context is missing.  Biden, who has a speech disorder, stumbled over the words ""I’m eager.""  We rate the claim that he said a racial slur False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EA9C3C40>],/factchecks/2021/feb/26/facebook-posts/joe-biden-stumbled-over-his-words-recent-speech/

How much goes to COVID-19 vaccines in the stimulus bill?
","Republicans’ primary objection to the COVID-19 and economic stimulus bill making its way through Congress is that it spends relatively little on the disease itself. In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the $1.9 trillion package known as the American Rescue Plan was loaded with ""pet projects"" that had nothing to do with the pandemic or economic recovery. ""All kinds of liberal wish list items that would do nothing to help American families put COVID behind them,"" McConnell said Feb. 24. ""Just about 1% of the money is for vaccines."" McConnell’s focus on 1% for vaccines caught our attention. His staff said he drew on the words of the Democrats themselves when they unveiled a key section of the sweeping bill. The chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., highlighted a handful of items in the package in a news release, including $14 billion for vaccines, $46 billion for testing, contact tracing, and mitigation, and $25 billion to reduce health disparities across the country. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget use the $14 billion figure. However, there are different ways to add up the numbers. The same Democratic-controlled committee that provided the $14 billion figure came out a few days later with a factsheet that uses an amount of $20 billion. And they note there’s an additional $5 billion for advanced vaccine development. The different totals depend on what counts as vaccine spending. The lower figure in the first Democratic press release included only work at the CDC, the FDA, and ensuring a reliable supply chain to produce and administer the vaccine. The higher Democratic tally included other activities, such as sequencing the genome of virus variants and paying for health care workers to administer the vaccine. How much does this matter? In percentage terms, not that much. Even a total of $25 billion still amounts to just over 1% of the bill’s estimated price tag. That’s because the overall package includes big ticket items such as $422 billion in stimulus checks to individuals, $350 billion for state and local governments, and $242 billion for expanded unemployment benefits. But in terms of dollars, there’s a big difference between $14 billion and $20 billion or $25 billion. The point is, it’s possible to use percentages to make an amount appear small, and actual dollars to make the same amount look substantial. The most heated debate in Congress centers on how the American Rescue Plan deals with the economic damage of the pandemic. McConnell’s claim has more to do with the money aimed most directly at the virus and pandemic itself. In that vein, focussing strictly on vaccines leaves out a lot of the picture.  The biggest overlooked piece is $46 billion for testing and other surveillance work.  That work is as important as any other, said Amesh Adalja at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Better surveillance helps target vaccine distribution to certain states or communities, and is part of spotting virus mutations to improve the next generation of vaccines. ""There is a continuum and integration between all response activities,"" Adajla said. ""Those include testing, tracing, isolating and vaccinating."" Vaccines have to make their way into people’s arms, and the legislation funds several programs to support that work, including $7.6 billion to hire 100,000 community health workers. We found different ways to add up all the spending tied directly to COVID-19. On the low end, the total is about $100 billion. On the high end, the White House says it is $160 billion, which adds items such as $10 billion in medical supplies, $24 billion in child care for health care and other essential workers, and literally dozens of smaller amounts. Depending on which line items you include, the legislation would spend anywhere from 4.5% to 8.5% of the total cost directly on the pandemic’s health aspects. McConnell said that in the American Rescue Plan, ""just about 1% of the money is for vaccines."" Based on Democratic figures of either $14 billion or $20 billion for vaccines, and a $1.9 trillion overall price tag, the math is about right. The American Rescue Plan spends much more on the financial damage caused by the virus than on its health aspects alone, and McConnell picked a way to minimize the health-related spending. The statistic omits a much greater amount of spending on overall efforts to contain the pandemic. That ranges from about $100 billion to $160 billion, or between 5% and 8% of the bill’s total cost. His statement is accurate, but needs additional information. That’s our definition of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBAD840>],/factchecks/2021/feb/26/mitch-mcconnell/how-much-goes-covid-19-vaccines-stimulus-bill/

Johnson on target with Keystone Pipeline job loss claim
","On his first day in office, President Joe Biden signed an executive order revoking the March 2019 permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline. The pipeline was to carry crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries. The pipeline is opposed by environmental groups, but had won federal approval under then-President Donald Trump. Construction began in 2020, but only a mile or so of the pipeline had been completed before Biden’s action. His order cited a 2015 review by the Department of State and then-President Barack Obama, which found the pipeline would not serve the U.S. national interest.  In the wake of the order, several Wisconsin politicians criticized the move as a job-killer for, yes, Wisconsin. That’s because two state-based companies had a contract to work on the project. (House Republicans introduced a bill to bring back the pipeline on Feb. 2, 2021). In a Jan. 21, 2021 post on Facebook, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, listed a series of things that would be lost with the end of the project, including ""10,000 union jobs (nearly 2,000 with Wisconsin companies)."" Let’s zero in on the last part. Would ending the pipeline cost nearly 2,000 union jobs with Wisconsin companies? In its November 2015 report, the State Department wrote that only 50 jobs would be required to maintain the pipeline after construction – 35 full-time jobs and 15 contractors. So the majority of the jobs for the Keystone pipeline would be short-term and construction-related. At the time, the report noted the pipeline would lead to 3,900 direct construction jobs. Of course, that number may have risen in the intervening five years, and in claims about the economic impact of projects, secondary-jobs are often considered. When asked for backup, Johnson’s office pointed to two online posts. One post, from Sept. 3, 2020, was by Michels Corporation, based in Brownsville, Wisconsin. The other, dated Jan. 5, 2021, was on the website for the Keystone XL Pipeline, run by TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. (TransCanada is an affiliate of Canada-based TC Energy Corporation, which was to own the pipeline with the Alberta government.) The Michels Corp. post said the company would employ more than 350 people on facilities projects during peak construction. The career page on the company’s web site says Michels offers both union and non-union jobs. The TransCanada/Keystone page includes a quote from Bobby Poteete, president of Precision Pipeline, an Eau Claire-based subsidiary of Florida-based MasTec, Inc.: ""We are extremely proud to put PPL employees and more than 1,600 American union members to work on completing this important infrastructure project…"" Later, that post includes, ""PPL will be responsible for hiring an estimated 1,600 union workers over the two-year construction period."" So over the course of construction, that will be a total of 1,950 jobs – or ""nearly"" 2,000 jobs– provided by Wisconsin companies. We reached out to Michels and Precision Pipeline, but neither responded. The Wisconsin companies were chosen alongside three Texas companies and a Montana company in October 2020 by TC Energy. Johnson’s claim could lead readers to believe the jobs would be permanent, or that 2,000 are already at risk.  But the jobs involved are temporary, construction ones. And the total number would fluctuate over the course of the project. For instance, Michaels said it would be employing the 350 workers only when they reached peak construction.  What’s more, the jobs would also likely be outside of Wisconsin, because the pipeline’s path is through Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. So, that would lessen the impact on the state of any lost jobs -- and related spending power -- due to Biden’s action. Johnson said in a Facebook post that shutting down the construction of the Keystone pipeline would result in ""nearly 2,000 (union jobs lost) with Wisconsin companies"" Based on the information we could find, the number checks out. Two Wisconsin companies were among the six that have been awarded construction contracts, and roughly 2,000 jobs are involved. That said, readers could have easily understood Johnson to mean permanent jobs, when they would be only temporary. And the total represents a peak, not current jobs. We rate his claim Mostly True.   ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC943C0>],/factchecks/2021/feb/26/ron-johnson/johnson-target-keystone-pipeline-job-loss-claim/

Facebook posts blaming Biden for insulin prices miss the mark
","Soon after President Joe Biden took office, social media users accused the new president of hiking insulin prices for people with diabetes.  ""Insulin went from $60 to $500 with the swipe of creepy Joe's pen,"" one widespread Facebook post said. ""Insulin: Month's supply under DJT, $60. Under Biden, $328,"" said another. The posts, and others like them, were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The posts echoed a similar statement from a Senate candidate who claimed Biden had raised the cost of insulin for some of the most vulnerable Americans. PolitiFact rated that Mostly False. That claim hinged on the Biden administration’s decision to freeze the implementation of several federal agency rules that had not gone into effect as of Jan. 20. Among those pending rules was an insulin-related executive order issued by former President Donald Trump in July 2020. But the White House’s decision to temporarily freeze the rule could not have raised the current price of insulin products because the rule had not gone into effect yet. It was set to kick in on Jan. 22, two days after the White House announced its regulatory freeze. The freeze on the insulin-related rule is effective until March 22. Moreover, the Trump rule is narrowly targeted and would not apply to most Americans. The rule would apply to federally qualified health centers, which are government-supported clinics that help people facing financial obstacles to care and prescription drugs. Specifically, it would require those centers to pass along to patients any discounts they get on purchases of insulin and epinephrine through a federal drug pricing program called 340B, rather than pocketing the difference. Supporters of the rule say it would help people who struggle to pay for pricey medications, but the Health and Human Services Department wrote in the Federal Register that it believed the rule would have ""minimal economic impact"" because of its limited scope. ""Many FQHCs reported already passing their discount savings onto patients and that the rule would create an administrative burden,"" the American Diabetes Association said in a statement. The National Association of Community Health Centers said in its own statement that ""overall prices of insulin and Epipens across the country are not affected by the Trump Administration regulation or the recent action by the Biden Administration."" Rising insulin prices are a problem for the millions of Americans who rely on the medication to manage their diabetes. The high costs have been driven largely by the business practices of manufacturers, health plans and pharmacy benefit managers, PolitiFact reported. PolitiFact messaged the two Facebook posters who said their insulin costs had jumped from $60 to $500 and $328. We did not hear back from either. A November report from GoodRx, a company that reports on drug prices, shows wide variation in the retail prices for 27 insulin products across all manufacturers and insulin types. But over time, ""insulin prices are stable,"" said Tori Marsh, director of GoodRx research, who re-crunched the numbers in a chart for PolitiFact.   A patient holds a vial of insulin during a news conference outside the Olde Walkersville Pharmacy on July 28, 2019, in Windsor, Ontario, where the medication is far less expensive than across the border in Detroit. (AP) What patients pay for insulin depends on several factors, including the type of insulin product they use and the type of insurance coverage they have, if any. Both insurance plans and drug prices can change year to year. ""One possibility for those with insurance coverage is that their plan may have made changes to the insulin products they cover, or changed the preferred status of certain insulins, actions which would increase out-of-pocket costs between one year and another,"" said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Insulin costs could have also gone up for some patients because their insurance includes a deductible at the start of each new year, Cubanski said. These patients would have to pay full price for their medications until their out-of-pocket costs surpass the deductible. ""The January price increases that consumers may have seen were likely because of their deductible resetting,"" Marsh said. These explanations for high prices are ""just the basic facts of how insurance works, not the result of any Biden administration action,"" Cubanski said, adding that Biden has not changed any Trump administration policies affecting insulin beyond the regulatory freeze. For example, a Trump administration policy created a new option under Medicare Part D where drug plans can provide enrollees insulin at a flat monthly copay. It took effect in January, and it hasn’t changed. A Facebook post claimed insulin prices rose ""with the swipe of (Joe Biden’s) pen."" Individuals who take insulin could have seen prices fluctuate for several reasons related to their insurance coverage and the specific medication they use. But those changes can’t be pinned on the Biden administration’s actions, experts said.  The Biden administration did temporarily freeze a directive related to one federal program, but that would not have affected current insulin prices, because the policy had not yet taken effect.
