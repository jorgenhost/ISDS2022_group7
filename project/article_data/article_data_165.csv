Fahy claim about 'disappointing' marijuana revenue is wrong
","Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants New York state to legalize recreational marijuana. Some state lawmakers, including Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes, D-Buffalo, have long supported the idea. But there has been pushback to Cuomo’s proposal. Assemblymember Patricia Fahy, a Democrat from the Albany area, favors starting with decriminalization but raises concerns about youth usage and driving under the influence, among other issues. Fahy wrote an op-ed in the Times-Union of Albany and discussed her concerns in media interviews. In an interview with radio host Susan Arbetter, Fahy questioned how much tax money New York state would collect if recreational marijuana became legal. ""Everybody thinks that this is going to be a massive money-maker,"" she said. ""There are projections of $200 to $400 million additional in New York state. We are seeing all those numbers reach disappointing levels in the states that have legalized. They’re not meeting their targets for the most part.""     The Cuomo administration predicts $300 million in tax revenue from the sale of recreational marijuana once legalization is fully phased in, according to budget materials. But is Fahy correct? Have other states missed their revenue targets?   Ten other states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana, though Vermont and DC do not allow commercial sales. An assessment by New York State agencies on the effects of legalization, published in July 2018, warned that ""some states overestimated revenue initially, as they did not account for the length of time it takes for a recreational market to be established, leading to fewer than expected sales."" We asked Fahy’s spokesman, Alexander Flood, for evidence of her claim. He pointed us to California, where the state collected less than it anticipated in the first full year of marijuana sales after a rocky rollout. He also referred us to reporting that showed that Colorado’s revenues didn’t meet expectations in the beginning. ""The complexity of the laws at the state level being rolled out has, in turn, complicated revenue projections for these states,"" Flood wrote in an email. We looked at revenue results in states that have legalized commercial sales: Maine is still working on its rules and regulations, and Michigan just legalized in November 2018. While many states have seen impressive growth in revenue, predicting future revenue may be complicated. States have a difficult time predicting usage, pricing and how legalization in nearby states affect tax revenues, according to a report from Pew Charitable Trusts and the Rockefeller Institute for Government, both nonpartisan organizations. However, researchers wrote that ""volatility in marijuana tax collections has been less of an issue and has primarily stemmed from seasonality.""      Fahy said states that have legalized recreational marijuana ""are not meeting their targets for the most part."" It is true that, at first, some states struggled to meet their targets because of a slower than expected rollout of legalization. This occurred in Colorado, California and Alaska. Revenue, however, has grown in Colorado and Alaska. Oregon, Washington state and Nevada never had problems reaching their targets. To say that states aren’t meeting their revenue targets ""for the most part"" doesn’t give a clear picture of what’s happening with legalized marijuana in the states. We rate Fahy’s statement Mostly False.    ",/factchecks/2019/jan/21/patricia-fahy/fahy-claims-marijuana-revenue-disappointing/

Did Chico cut waste and slash taxes during his City Colleges stint?
","Mayoral candidate Gery Chico is far from a new face on Chicago’s political stage, and he’s playing that up in a recent TV ad that stresses how he chaired Chicago’s public school board and the board of the City Colleges system under former Mayor Richard M. Daley. ""When I was president of CPS, we turned record deficits into a surplus and we built new neighborhood schools,"" Chico says in the spot. ""As chairman of the City Colleges, I cut millions in waste and we cut property taxes."" We recently fact-checked as Mostly True a claim by another mayoral contender, Paul Vallas, that mirrored what Chico is saying about the years he spent as president of the Chicago Board of Education. Vallas was CEO of the city’s schools at the same time Chico headed the school board, so any financial turnaround claimed by one can be claimed by the other. But Chico’s boast about City Colleges also caught our attention. Cutting millions in spending and slashing property taxes sounded like a tall order, especially given that Chico’s tenure at City Colleges began in 2010 and lasted less than seven months. He quit to run for mayor in the 2011 city elections, which he lost to the now-retiring Rahm Emanuel. Board documents from Chico’s days appear to back up his claim that property taxes and spending were cut under his watch. But those same documents also make clear that savings passed on to individual taxpayers from his property tax cuts were underwhelming and set in motion before Chico took the helm of City Colleges. First, let’s tackle the question of how much Chico saved in budget cuts. ""Waste"" is a subjective term, so we reached out to Chico’s campaign to ask what he meant by saying he cut ""millions"" of it. Spokeswoman Kelley Quinn said the colleges board under Chico eliminated several hundred non-teaching positions, scrapped dozens of unfilled jobs and reined in travel expenses. She pointed to news stories from the time describing the board’s push under Daley to reinvent the system and streamline its services. A city colleges financial review of the sole budget passed under Chico found staffing costs fell by $4.4 million while another $1.7 million was cut in the line item for travel, supplies and utility expenses. In both this ad and others, Chico casts himself as the candidate most likely to give taxpayers a break. City Colleges did cut its property tax levy under Chico. Still, the breaks Chico oversaw were so modest that it’s doubtful Chicago homeowners noticed them on tax bills. Context is important in analyzing taxes. The City Colleges’ share of the overall property tax burden in Chicago is tiny. It stood at a little over 3 percent of the tax burden when Chico ran the colleges board, Cook County tax records show. And the cuts he is now boasting about amounted to just a fraction of that 3-plus percent. Put another way, the tax reductions under Chico shaved about $3 off the 2010 and 2011 tax bills for the owner of a $200,000 Chicago home, according to county tax records. (In the arcane world of Cook County taxes, the 2009 levy was used to calculate bills sent in 2010 and the 2010 levy translated into 2011 bills.) At the same time the district was reducing its property tax levy it was hiking tuition costs for students, a City Colleges budget document shows. The Civic Federation, a Chicago-based government fiscal watchdog, noted in an analysis of Chico’s budget that the increased tuition still left City Colleges ""very competitively priced."" That said, it also meant the system was leaning more on students for revenue while giving a small break to property owners. It’s also worth noting that the City Colleges budget document explains that the lion’s share of the reductions in the property tax levy implemented under Chico had actually been ordered up by the board in July 2009 — nine months before he joined it. Chico said, ""as chairman of the City Colleges, I cut millions in waste and we cut property taxes."" He had but a cup of coffee at City Colleges, to borrow a phrase from baseball for a player who served just a short time in the Major Leagues. Spending was cut under Chico, as were taxes. But the savings to the owner of a modest Chicago bungalow amounted to barely enough to buy a real cup of coffee. What’s more, records make clear that a big portion of the tax cuts he takes credit for were set in motion before he arrived at City Colleges. Chico’s statement is accurate on its face but leaves out key details and context. We rate it Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

The White House also did not respond to an email about the Facebook post. But the claim appeared on Facebook the same day Trump took questions from the media on the South Lawn at the White House about the government shutdown. According to a transcript of his remarks, Trump said: ""I put out a quote this morning of Barack Obama; I put out a quote this morning of Hillary Clinton in 2015 — that was a few years ago — strongly saying that you need a border to keep illegals out. And that’s what you have to have. But it’s not just illegals. It’s criminals. It’s drugs. It’s the new phenomena that’s been age-old, been going on for thousands of years, but it’s never been worse than now because of the Internet. Human trafficking — where they grab women, put tape over their mouth, come through our border, and sell them. And they go both ways, in both directions."" Nearly a week later, on Jan. 11, Trump spoke again at the U.S. border patrol station in McAllen, Texas. According to a transcript of those remarks, Trump hit a similar note: ""In a few moments, the American people will hear directly from or frontline border agents about the tremendous flood of illegal immigration, drug trafficking, human trafficking — a phenomena that has been going on for a thousand years or more, and that you’d think was something that modern society wouldn’t have. And I hate to tell you that, because of the Internet, it’s worse than ever before. Human trafficking — it’s a horrible thing."" Though Trump did say ""thousands of years""—or, later, ""a thousand years or more""—while talking about border security, it was to lend historical context to the broader problem of human trafficking. While Trump's stream-of-consciousness manner of speaking does sometimes leave room for interpretation, actual transcripts show he did not suggest the United States itself is thousands of years old, or that illegal immigration has been a problem here for that long.

No, former Clinton Foundation CEO Eric Braverman is not missing
","Bill and Hillary Clinton have faced a number of scandals and conspiracy theories over the years, and ones about the family’s nonprofit charity continue to proliferate on the internet. One popular and often-resurrected rumor alleges former Clinton Foundation CEO Eric Braverman has been missing for an extended period of time after revealing Clinton secrets. The full claim, posted to Facebook, reads: ""Why is the mainstream media silent about the fact that former CEO of the Clinton Foundation has been missing for 70+ days and is rumored to be the source who said ‘follow the money & find the real HRC scandal’? WHERE IS ERIC BRAVERMAN?!"" A photo of Braverman is placed in the center next to the word ""MISSING."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no evidence that Braverman is missing or hiding out from the Clintons. The rumor has been previously debunked by fact-checkers, and Braverman currently serves as the chief executive of Schmidt Futures, a California-based charity. A reverse-image search on TinEye.com indicates even the meme itself is going on two years old. While Braverman hadn’t posted on social media for a while, he took to Twitter on Jan. 19, 2017, to announce he had accepted a position with the Schmidt Family Foundation. Thrilled to join @ericschmidt, @wenschmidt, and an amazing team as we bring the power of people and technology together to improve lives. He is still listed on the organization’s website as the chief executive of Schmidt Futures, the foundation’s philanthropic arm. In one story, the only evidence offered was Braverman not responding to press inquiries and his lack of social media use. That does not indicate a person is missing. We found no police reports listing Braverman as a ""missing person"" and no reputable media reports detailing his disappearance. Eric Braverman is an attorney and businessman who headed the Clinton Foundation from 2013 to 2015 when he resigned from the post. The rumor of his disappearance has been shared by social media users since at least October 2016. That timing suggests it likely evolved out of the John Podesta emails that WikiLeaks dumped in October and November 2016.

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers flips position on dissolving WEDC
","Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers was a vocal critic of the state’s economic development agency on the campaign trail, and he’s now in position to do something about it. The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. is a public-private partnership that oversees grants and loans given to businesses in exchange for the promise of new jobs, including the nearly $4 billion promised to Foxconn for a massive LCD panel factory in Racine County.  The agency has been mired in controversy for years amid bad loans, failures to verify created jobs and a critical state audit. Evers has consistently touted plans to eliminate the agency, but several conservative groups have alleged he is backing down from earlier claims that he’ll address that in his first budget. The state Republican party called it a ""broken promise,"" and the MacIver Institute — a conservative think tank based in Madison — said his current and former statements on WEDC stand in ""stark contrast."" It seemed a good time to pull out our Flip-O-Meter, which we use to gauge whether a candidate has changed his position. Our requisite reminder: We are not rating whether any change is good or bad) politics or policy -- just whether the politician has been consistent. Has Evers been consistent in his pledge to dissolve WEDC? The background Evers has been a persistent critic of the jobs agency, which former Gov. Scott Walker and Republican legislators created days after Walker took office in 2011. WEDC replaced the state Department of Commerce, and Evers has said he plans to reverse that move — returning economic development to a state agency. Republican lawmakers threw a wrench in those plans in December 2018 when they temporarily limited the governor’s role in WEDC as part of a package of lame-duck bills. The legislation gives lawmakers control of the WEDC board until September 2019 and puts the board in charge of choosing a leader for the agency. The governor used to appoint that leader and will again after September 2019. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, has said GOP lawmakers wanted to temporarily take control to try to show Evers it works well and persuade him to keep it as is. Consistent criticism Evers’s criticism of WEDC has been consistent throughout the campaign. In an August 2018 interview, for example, he called the agency ""a constant source of controversy, inefficiency and ineffectiveness"" and said he planned to dissolve it. But his plan to replace it has been a moving target. He floated the idea of re-routing all WEDC funding to local economic development officials and having no state economic development department. But he abandoned that idea a day later. By November 2018 he was consistently referring to plans to replace WEDC with a state agency. Asked if dissolving WEDC remains the plan, Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback pointed to Evers’ past statements that he plans to replace it with a state jobs agency. But it remains unclear how and when that will happen. Inconsistent position On the campaign trail, Evers was explicit about the timing and method. At a Jan. 28, 2018, East Side Progressives candidate forum in Madison, when asked what priorities he will have in his first budget, including what he will fund and de-fund, Evers said:  ""We will de-fund WEDC."" Now, Evers is saying WEDC will not be addressed in his first biennial budget. ""I’m not going to be proposing anything in the budget about WEDC,"" the governor said in a Jan. 2, 2019, interview with Wisconsin Eye. ""We need to get this nine-month thing done,"" he said referring to the Legislature’s nine-month period of control. When asked if he would include changes in the budget and have them take effect after the nine-month window, Evers said no. ""I was never certain that changing WEDC was part and parcel of the budget anyway,"" he said. ""It could have been separate legislation."" Our rating Evers has consistently criticized WEDC and reiterated plans to get rid of it, but the details of how that will happen have noticeably shifted. In January 2018, candidate Evers said he would de-fund WEDC in his first budget. As governor, Evers now says he will not address WEDC in that budget, claiming he was ""never certain"" he would address it that way.

Mike Pence wrong that ISIS has been defeated
","Vice President Mike Pence took something of a victory lap for the administration on countering ISIS, the terrorist group that set out to establish an Islamic caliphate in portions of Iraq and Syria starting in 2014. ""Thanks to the leadership of this commander in chief and the courage and sacrifice of our armed forces, we’re now actually able to begin to hand off the fight against ISIS in Syria to our coalition partners, and we’re bringing our troops home,"" Pence said to the Global Chiefs of Mission Conference at the State Department. ""The caliphate has crumbled, and ISIS has been defeated."" On the same day, ISIS claimed responsibility for a suicide blast in Manbij, Syria, that killed four Americans — two service members, a defense contractor and a civilian working for the Defense Department, CNN reported. Three other U.S. service members were injured, according to the U.S. Central Command. The attack showed clear flaws in Pence’s assessment. (In a statement released later the same day, after the attack, he avoided similar phrasing, saying, ""The American people can be assured, for the sake of our soldiers, their families, and our nation, we will never allow the remnants of ISIS to reestablish their evil and murderous caliphate – not now, not ever."") We wondered about the basis for Pence’s claim in his State Department speech. Pence’s office didn’t respond to an inquiry. However, we found wide agreement among a half-dozen experts who study terrorism and foreign policy: ISIS land holdings have shrunk dramatically, but even before the Manbij attack, the group could in no way have been described as ""defeated."" In terms of reclaiming ISIS territory, there has been success — and noteworthy spillover effects. A report by the consulting firm IHS Markit released in June 2017 concluded that ISIS had lost ""more than 60 percent of its territory and 80 percent of its revenue"" by that point. That included ""a steady decline in all of the group’s financial streams: oil production and smuggling, taxation and confiscation, and other illicit activities."" In addition, IHS Markit said, ""the group’s video productions have declined in frequency, suggesting that it is less capable of disseminating its messages."" A few months later, in a Dec. 21, 2017, State Department briefing, Brett McGurk — then the special presidential envoy for the global coalition to counter ISIS — offered an even higher figure: 98 percent of land lost. McGurk added that ""7.7 million people (who) used to be living under ISIS are no longer living under ISIS."" A year later, McGurk effectively upped that to 99 percent, saying in a State Department briefing, ""We really are now down to the last 1 percent of the physical territory."" McGurk later resigned in protest of President Donald Trump’s announcement that he would be withdrawing troops from Syria — troops that many credited with helping keep ISIS in check. This map, published by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, shows the extent of ISIS’ land losses through August 2018:  At the same time, however, these losses of territory ""are driving the Islamic State to intensify its campaign of terrorist attacks abroad to compensate,"" the IHS Markit report said. And ISIS still has members available to carry out those attacks, like the one it claimed in Manbij. The number of remaining ISIS members is estimated at 30,000. For context, ""that is the equivalent of two U.S. Army divisions, and is many times the ‘thousand’ fighters al-Qaeda had before 9/11,"" said John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org. And those ISIS fighters are far from impotent, experts said. ""I don’t know of any credible analysis that agrees with the idea that ISIS has been defeated,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism specialist with the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies who tracks ISIS for his consulting group, Valens Global. The attack in Manbij ""was one in a sequence of a wide variety of attacks in both Syria and Iraq that suggest that ISIS is coming back as an insurgent movement,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. For instance, the Institute for the Study of War, which has tracked ISIS’ activity, recently wrote that ISIS is ""intensifying its campaign to destabilize"" Raqqa, its former capital. ISIS detonated a car bomb there on Nov. 4, 2018 -- the first such attack since the city was seized by the U.S.-led alliance against ISIS. ISIS also ""retains a support zone in the rural desert of Central Syria"" and appears to maintain ""access to the Syrian-Jordanian and Syrian-Iraqi border, as well as the key crossroads town of Palmyra in Central Syria,"" according to the Institute for the Study of War. The group has also used ""a dense network of caves and tunnels"" to avoid detection. Terrorism experts contacted by PolitiFact were universal in their agreement that Pence’s ""defeated"" comment was wrong. • ""In no way has it been defeated,"" said Michael O’Hanlon, a foreign-policy specialist at the Brookings Institution. • ""The caliphate has collapsed, but the terrorist threat from the Islamic State is very much alive and dangerous,"" said Bruce Riedel, director of Brookings’ intelligence project. • ""ISIS is not what it was between 2014 and 2016, but it is not defeated,"" said Mark Hamm, an Indiana State University criminologist who specializes in terrorism. • Not only is ""defeated"" inaccurate, said Bruce Hoffman, a professor at Georgetown University’s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, but it suggests ""a misunderstanding of terrorism as a phenomenon that can be ‘defeated’ in conventional military terms."" McGurk said as much the same during his 2017 and 2018 briefings. Less than a month before Pence’s speech, McGurk said, ""Even as the end of the physical caliphate is clearly now coming into sight, the end of ISIS will be a much more long-term initiative. ... Nobody is declaring a mission accomplished. Defeating a physical caliphate is one phase of a much longer-term campaign."" Even the White House acknowledged this in its National Strategy for Counterterrorism, released in October 2018. ISIS’ ""global reach remains robust, with eight official branches and more than two dozen networks regularly conducting terrorist and insurgent operations across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East,"" the report said. ""Despite many setbacks, ISIS maintains a sophisticated and durable media and online presence that allows it to encourage and enable sympathizers worldwide to conduct dozens of attacks within target countries, including the United States. The increase in attacks by persons mobilized to violence in the United States underscores the ability of ISIS to inspire terrorist attacks."" Pence said, ""The caliphate has crumbled and ISIS has been defeated."" Experts agree that ISIS caliphate is essentially gone. However, the crumbled caliphate does not mean that ISIS has been ""defeated,"" not by a long shot. Even the White House itself acknowledged that reality just three months ago.

How many migrants come to the US each day? Republican says 2,000
","To justify the partial government shutdown, Republicans have argued that America’s southern border is in desperate need of reinforcement. Some federal employees have been prevented from working or have worked without pay since the shutdown started in December, when Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House. As part of negotiations to reopen the government, President Donald Trump has requested $5.7 billion for his wall project along the southern border. Trump and other Republicans, including Rep. Ted Budd of North Carolina, have characterized the issue as a humanitarian crisis. In a tweet on Jan. 9 and his newsletter on Jan. 11, Budd said many migrants are being exploited. ""We have a crisis at our border with 2,000 inadmissible migrants arriving every day,"" he also said. Is it true that 2,000 ""inadmissible"" migrants arrive every day at the southern border? PolitiFact NC looked at data provided by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP), which operates under the Department of Homeland Security. It turns out the word ""inadmissible"" has a very specific meaning in the Customs and Border Protection agency. ""Inadmissible"" migrants are those who are turned away by border agents at ports of entry for any of a variety of reasons (such as lacking the proper paperwork). The agency also tracks ""apprehensions,"" which refers to unauthorized migrants taken into custody between ports of entry. A chart, recent press release and other stats from the border protection agency provide useful information for rating Budd’s statement. Turns out, Budd’s claim is true only if readers group together ""inadmissible"" and ""apprehended"" migrants (which they’re likely to do, since most are unfamiliar with government lingo), and if the daily average is measured using a specific time frame. Let’s look at how Budd is way off if we look exclusively at inadmissible migrants. Inadmissible migrants In fiscal year 2018, from October 2017 to September 2018, 124,511 inadmissiblemigrants tried to enter the U.S. along the southwest border. That’s about 341 people per day. Budd’s claim remains off if we look at the rest of calendar year 2018. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) counted 9,771 inadmissible migrants in October, 10,600 in November, and 10,029 in December. That totals 30,400 inadmissible migrants over 92 days, which averages out to about 330 per day. That’s nowhere near the 2,000 figure Budd mentioned in his newsletter. Now let’s look at what happens when we conflate inadmissible migrants with those who were apprehended. 2018 inadmissible and apprehended migrants CBP counted a combined 521,090 inadmissible and apprehended migrants in fiscal year 2018 (October 2017 through September 2018) which equates to 1,428 per day. What about calendar year 2018? By our calculations, an average of 1,618 people per day were either apprehended or denied entry by border agents in 2018. 35,905 in January 36,751 in February 50,347 in March 51,168 in April 51,862 in May 43,180 in June 40,149 in July 46,719 in August 50,568 in September 60,772 in October 62,456 in November 60,782 in December That equals 590,659 in 2018. Divide that by 365 (the number of days in a year) and we get 1,618. Where Budd has a point Using the aforementioned CBP data, the only way PolitiFact NC could get Budd’s math to work was by considering the average number of both inadmissible and apprehended migrants in the fourth quarter of the 2018 calendar year. CBP counted a total of 184,010 inadmissible and apprehended migrants over October, November and December. That averages out to approximately 2,000 migrants apprehended or stopped by Border Patrol over the last 92 days of 2018. The daily average hits 2,020 migrants per day if you cut out October and look at inadmissible migrants and apprehensions over the two most recent months: November and December. But if you look at December, alone, the average dips down to about 1,961. Asylum seekers included But here’s another piece of context that could help us understand the number of migrants who are being detained at the southern border: asylum seekers are counted by CBP among those who are inadmissible or apprehended. Seeking asylum is legal, but requests for asylum aren’t always granted. CBP classifies those migrants as having ""claims of credible fear."" In fiscal year 2018, 92,959 (18 percent) of the 521,090 apprehended/inadmissible migrants filed claims of credible fear. Jessica Bolter, a research assistant at the Migration Policy Institute, noted that, in fiscal year 2018, 27 percent of migrants who made a ""claim of credible fear"" went on to be granted the right to seek asylum. ""This does not mean that 27% of people who made credible fear claims in (fiscal year) 2018 were ultimately approved for asylum … Asylum applications filed in a given year are rarely, if ever, completed the same year due to the immigration court backlog,"" Bolter said in an email.. ""But,"" she added, ""the majority of those who made credible fear claims were allowed to stay, if only temporarily, while they waited for their asylum hearings."" In total, about 6,000 migrants who passed through ""credible fear screening"" (27 percent of all completed cases in which an asylum application was filed) established that they should be granted asylum, according to Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman. ""The vast majority of asylum applications are not meritorious,"" according to a statement Waldman relayed to PolitiFact. And that can be problematic, the statement says. ""Low standards for claiming a fear of persecution have allowed aliens with meritless claims to illegally enter our country, claim ‘credible fear’, and then in many cases be released pending lengthy proceedings though the statute calls for mandatory detention,"" Waldman’s statement says. ""A combination of resource constraints and questionable court decisions leading to loopholes in our immigration system have handicapped DHS’s ability to detain them."" Our ruling Congressman Budd said ""2,000 inadmissible migrants"" arrive ""every day"" in the United States. There is some overall truth in Budd’s claim that, every day, there are indeed hundreds of migrants who are found not admissible. But the only way to get the number he used is to use a very broad definition of ""inadmissible,"" use the most narrow time period, and disregard migrants who are granted the right to seek asylum.

State Rep. Jim Ott misfires on early voting claim
","With more than 2.6 million votes cast, Wisconsin saw a record-breaking number of voters in the 2018 midterm election, which resulted in narrow victories for now-Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul, both Democrats. In December 2018, during the lame-duck session, a set of GOP-backed bills aimed at curtailing some powers of the new administration passed and were signed by outgoing Gov. Scott Walker. Senate Bills 883, 884 and 886 affected many powers, including the governor’s ability to make changes to health care and public benefits programs. State Rep. Jim Ott, R-Mequon, is emphatic that at least one thing was not done. In an email to constituents sent out in December, Ott headlined one bullet point: ""Early voting was not eliminated."" The item noted that in past elections, large cities, including Milwaukee, Madison and Green Bay, offered early voting for up to six weeks before Election Day --  far longer than many smaller municipalities. It then claims SB 884 levels the playing field, since ""municipalities are now required to have two or more polling locations opened 24-hours a day, two weeks before any election."" Is Ott right, that the playing field is now leveled? In a word, no. SB 884 and the election hours According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, individual villages, towns and cities are responsible for setting the dates and hours of in-person absentee voting for their municipalities. They still have this discretion, though the GOP action cut back the duration of early voting. Under the changes, if early voting is offered, it could not begin sooner than 14 days, or two weeks, before an election. Voters can cast their ballot no later than the Sunday prior to Election Day, so that provides 13 days of potential early voting, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The hours of voting would still be decided by local governments. So, counter to what Ott’s email claimed, that doesn’t necessarily mean polling places will be operating 24 hours a day -- or even that a given municipality will offer early voting at all. Indeed, there could still be wide discrepancies within that window, so the playing field is not leveled at all. When asked about the claim, Ginger Mueller from Ott’s office said the wrong word was inadvertently used. ""That should have read ‘…municipalities are allowed to have….’"" she wrote in an email. ""Thank you for bringing it our attention.""

One Wisconsin Institute v. Thomsen The subject of election hours has long been a hot one in Madison. In 2016, liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Institute and Citizen Action of Wisconsin Education Fund filed a lawsuit over the GOP-passed state voter ID law. The case resulted in six separate legislative actions being deemed unconstitutional by U.S. District Judge James Peterson -- including limiting the time period for in-person early voting except the Monday before Election Day. At the time, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Peterson called limits on early voting part of a Republican effort to stifle votes for partisan gain and dismissed GOP claims of wanting uniform rules for both rural and urban communities. Peterson also noted that limiting early voting would disadvantage minority voters. The two plaintiffs in the original suit filed a memorandum against the limits of early voting presented in SB 884, requesting the state enforce the previous injunction set out by Peterson. The state denied the request, saying it lacked jurisdiction to enforce anything while the case is pending on appeal. Our rating In an email to constituents, Ott said a bill passed by Republicans levels the field for early-voting because ""municipalities are now required to have two or more polling locations opened 24-hours a day, two weeks before any election."" But, that’s not what the bill said. It set a two-week maximum time period for early voting. It did not require every municipality to offer it for that whole window. Likewise, it did not specify they would be open 24 hours a day. Those determinations will still be made at the local level, so inconsistencies are likely to remain. We rate Ott’s claim False.  ",/factchecks/2019/jan/15/jim-ott/state-rep-jim-ott-misfires-early-voting-claim/

""People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do,"" he wrote. ""That’s why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole.

Fate of March food stamps uncertain, but not ruled out, amid shutdown
","A notice on Facebook warns that due to the federal government shutdown, food stamps will no longer be available for March. ""March 2019 and on-going food benefits WILL NOT be available until further notice. Clients are encouraged to use their food benefits as soon as possible in case SNAP benefits are unavailable in March,"" says the Jan. 14 post. This post, which was shared 5,000 times within two days, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, there is some truth to part of the statement, although the sentence that says food stamps ""will not be available"" in March is premature. The post included phone numbers for the Food Bank of Delaware. That organization led us to find the same information on a flyer, which directs people to a website for Delaware’s Health and Social Services agency. A spokeswoman for the state agency pointed PolitiFact to a news release, which made no predictions about benefits in March. ""Our hope is to be back on the regular schedule beginning in March,"" it states. The flyer correctly states that SNAP recipients will receive benefits for February in January, as announced by the federal government last week. Advocates are concerned that recipients may not realize what is happening and spend their February benefits in January, and then run out of food. The federal department hasn’t announced that benefits will be cut off in March if the shutdown continues. While SNAP benefits are considered an entitlement, meaning that anyone who qualifies can receive benefits if he or she applies, the program is historically funded through the annual appropriations process, generally as part of the agriculture bill. Dottie Rosenbaum, an expert on SNAP at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told PolitiFact she doesn’t think many states could cover the cost of food stamps in the event the federal government doesn’t fund the program. ""Even if they could, it's not clear how they would get the state appropriation to do so in the middle of the year, and it's not clear whether they would be able to be reimbursed after the fact,"" she said. ""USDA hasn't indicated."" Elaine Waxman, an expert on food benefits at the Urban Institute, said it’s anybody’s guess what will happen. But she thinks it is likely that the federal government will have to find a solution because SNAP benefits are an important part of the food economy, providing benefits to people and making up a key share of retailer revenues. Nationally, about 39 million individuals get SNAP benefits, an average of $123 a month. Generally speaking, the number of food stamp recipients has declined since 2013. In Delaware, more than 136,000 individuals get food stamps, most of them children, seniors and people with disabilities. James P. Ziliak, director of the Center for Poverty Research at the University of Kentucky, said that if SNAP benefits are cut off, ""we will enter largely uncharted territory since the inception of the modern Food Stamp Program in 1977."" Organizations including the Food Bank of Delaware are preparing for a potential influx of visitors in the spring. A Facebook post said, ""March 2019 and on-going food benefits WILL NOT be available until further notice. Clients are encouraged to use their food benefits as soon as possible in case SNAP benefits are unavailable in March."" The first part of that post is premature because it is unknown if SNAP benefits, more commonly referred to as food stamps, will be available in March.

Obama correct that civilian deaths and bombings are down in Iraq
","
In a news conference on April 29, 2009, President Barack Obama was asked if recent violence in Iraq would affect his strategy or timetable for withdrawal of U.S. troops.
 
Earlier in day, three car bombs killed at least 51 people in markets in Baghdad.
 
Obama responded by saying the recent violence should be seen in context.
 
""Well, first of all, I think it's important to note that although you've seen some spectacular bombings in Iraq that are a legitimate cause of concern, civilian deaths, incidents of bombings, et cetera, remain very low relative to what was going on last year, for example,"" Obama said. ""And so you haven't seen the kinds of huge spikes that you were seeing for a time.  The political system is holding and functioning in Iraq.""
 
We checked with the Defense Department and other sources to see if Obama was correct about declining rates of civilian deaths and bombings. The short answer is that he is.
 
The number of civilian deaths and bombings in Iraq peaked during 2007, and has steadily decreased since a surge of forces was approved by President George W. Bush.
 
Obama specifically said civilian deaths and bombings have decreased ""relative to what was going on last year."" So we compared recent numbers with early 2008.
 
According to a report from the Defense Department based on information from coalition forces and the Iraqi government, civilian deaths in Iraq ranged from 600 in January 2008 up to 950 in April. The number of civilian deaths in early 2009 have been markedly lower: 270 in January, 230 in February and 260 in March.
 
That's dramatically lower than late 2006 and early 2007, when civilian deaths were about 3,500 a month.
 
As for bombings, those too hit a peak in early 2007, with about 130 in February of that year. By early 2008, they were down to 40 to 60 explosions per month.
 
The recent report to Congress noted that current levels of bombings were lower than at any time since the spring of 2004, but added that al-Qaida ""retains the intent and capability to carry out spectacular attacks.""
 
Lt. Col. Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for the Defense Department, told PolitiFact that in addition to fewer bombings, there has been a shift in targets. At the height of violence in years past, he said, most bombings were aimed at U.S. military and Iraq military and security forces. Recent attacks have targeted mosques, markets and other ""soft targets"" in an attempt to incite sectarian violence. That suggests opposition resources are more limited than in the past, Ryder said.
 
The nonpartisan Brookings Institution also puts out something called the Iraq Index that keeps monthly tabs on security and reconstruction in Iraq. The detailed reports track the number of multiple-fatality bombings (more than a third of them from suicide bombings), as well as the number of people killed and wounded in those bombings. Both also back up Obama's contention. We note that Brookings bases much of its data on information from the U.S. government, but also gets information from press reports and other sources.
 
So information from coalition forces in Iraq, the Iraqi government and press reports all back up Obama's statement. We rule it True.

Boehner cites ""Debt Day"" numbers carefully
","


""In short, about halfway through fiscal year 2009, Washington has run out of money.""




In an op-ed published April 26, House Republican Leader John Boehner laid out a case for ""Debt Day.""


""It is the day of the Fiscal Year — beginning on Oct. 1 of the previous calendar year — on which total government spending exceeds total federal revenues,"" Boehner wrote. ""And in our current fiscal year, that falls on April 26 — this Sunday, just days before the administration’s 100th day milestone. In short, about halfway through fiscal year 2009, Washington has run out of money.""


Now keep in mind, we know ""Debt Day"" is not a literal concept. Thanks to withholding and estimated taxes, the government collects income tax revenues year-round, and it has other sources of tax revenues as well. It also borrows money by selling U.S. Treasury securities. So the government does not have to shut down because its pockets are empty.


Boehner acknowledges that, calling it a symbol of ""our government’s arrogant culture of spending."" We were intrigued by the ""Debt Day"" claim and wanted to check Boehner's numbers for accuracy.


He uses numbers provided by the Congressional Budget Office that are widely regarded as fair and accurate. And he accurately explains how he uses them to calculate debt.


Boehner blames the Obama administration for a ""borrowing binge"" in his editorial, but it's only fair to note that the 2009 budget started back on Oct. 1, 2008, when Boehner's fellow Republican George W. Bush was president. Parts of that budget were finalized, however, under Obama's watch on March 11, 2009.


Boehner also notes accurately that ""Debt Day"" has arrived earlier this year than any time in the past decade, since the surpluses that marked the end of the Clinton administration.


Here are the ""Debt Days"" for previous years, based on CBO numbers. Again, it's important to remember the calendar for these dates starts Oct. 1 of the previous year, not Jan. 1. We've also included the percentage of each year's budget that was actually paid with government revenues, as opposed to borrowing:


2002 - Sept. 2 - 92 percent

2003 - July 29 - 83 percent

2004 - July 27 - 82 percent

2005 - Aug. 14 - 87 percent

2006 - Aug. 27 - 91 percent

2007 - Sept. 9 - 94 percent

2008 - Aug. 5 - 84 percent

2009 - April 26 - 57 percent


Boehner carefully explains how he arrives at the ""Debt Day"" number, and he uses widely accepted numbers in his calculations. The statement we're checking here is, ""In short, about halfway through fiscal year 2009, Washington has run out of money."" That ""halfway"" number is a little bit of a push; it's actually 57 percent of the year. And, the ""run out of money"" is metaphorical, not literal. But Boehner is right with his central point that we're spending more money than we're taking in, and that the difference is close to the halfway mark this fiscal year. So we rate his statement True.

Sen. Lindsey Graham claims that Geneva Conventions didn't apply to war on terror until 2005
","
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has strongly urged President Barack Obama not to prosecute government officials who provided legal advice related to controversial interrogation techniques.


On April 26, 2009, Graham said on CNN's

State of the Union

that he doesn't believe there is any basis to pursue legal action.


""The Geneva Convention did not apply, until 2005, to the war on terror,"" Graham said. ""So I can't conceive of a statute that you could prosecute anyone under because their endeavor was not to commit a crime but to look at the law and come up with aggressive interrogation techniques to get information from an enemy that we all thought was coming after us again.""
 
""So I think it's ridiculous to say the lawyers were trying to break the law,"" Graham said. ""They were trying to interpret the law to protect the nation.""
 
We won't try to settle the debate of whether the lawyers should be prosecuted, but we wondered if Graham was correct that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to the ""war on terror"" until 2005. We found that there is no consensus.
 
It's been the subject of intense legal debate dating back to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 attacks. At that time, the question was whether al-Qaida or Taliban fighters were truly combatants in an international war who are expressly covered by the Geneva Conventions.


The Bush administration said they were not. A Feb. 7, 2002, memo signed by Bush declared that the Third Geneva Convention — which sets standards for the treatment of prisoners of war — did not apply to al-Qaida or Taliban detainees. But the memo said the United States should ""continue to treat detainees humanely and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity, in a manner consistent with the principles of the Geneva Convention.""
 
In 2006, the Supreme Court disagreed. It ruled in the case of

Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld

that detainees were entitled to the full protections of the Geneva Conventions, specifically Article 3, which prohibits ""outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment"" of detainees. Graham contends that until the Supreme Court made that decision, the Geneva Conventions did not apply. But legal experts have a wide range of opinions about whether that is true.
 
""Bottom line, the Geneva Conventions were in effect when the planes went into the buildings and throughout Bush's so-called war on terror,"" said David M. Crane, a law professor at Syracuse University and onetime chief prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, an international war crimes tribunal.


Linda Malone, director of the Human Rights and National Security Law Program at William and Mary Law School, agrees. When the United States invaded Afghanistan, ""certainly there was an international conflict and certainly we had combatants,"" she said.


And even if there was a question about the status of prisoners, she said, under the Geneva Conventions, an international tribunal is supposed to be convened to determine their status. But Bush claimed he had the power to make that decision.
 
The International Committee of the Red Cross, which seeks to ensure humanitarian protection and assistance for victims of war and armed violence, offers a more mixed view of the controversy.
 
Florian Westphal, a spokesman for the group, said in an e-mail to PolitiFact that ""fundamentally, the Geneva Conventions as a whole apply to any international armed conflict. However, what has commonly been described as the 'war on terror' does not wholly correspond to the definition of an international armed conflict as put forward by the Conventions.""
 
The ICRC's position is that the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan that started in October 2001 was an international armed conflict as defined under humanitarian law, and that the 1949 Geneva Conventions were fully applicable. However, the group said, things get murkier when talking about ""terrorist"" activity around the world perpetrated by loosely organized groups that, at best, share a common ideology.
 
""'Terrorism' is a phenomenon. Both practically and legally, war cannot be waged against a phenomenon, but only against an identifiable party to an armed conflict,"" the ICRC stated in a fact sheet. Still, the ICRC concludes, ""Persons detained in relation to a noninternational armed conflict waged as part of the fight against terrorism — as is the case with Afghanistan since June 2002 — are protected by Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions and the relevant rules of customary international humanitarian law.""
 
Graham is right that the Supreme Court decision clarified the law (though he was off by a year when he said the ruling came in 2005 instead of 2006). But he goes too far by suggesting it was not the case before that decision. Some legal experts say that the prisoners have always been subject to the Geneva Conventions. We rate Graham's statement Half True.

Gingrich has moderated tone on torture
","
When we hear charges of ""most bitter hypocrisy,"" we know it's time to pull out our Flip-O-Meter.
 
Such was the case when we saw MSNBC host Keith Olbermann attacking Newt Gingrich, a Republican who was House speaker in the 1990s. ""Imagine being Newt Gingrich and looking into that mirror this morning and seeing that vast terrain of hypocrisy looking right back at you,"" Olbermann said on April 27, 2009.
 
At issue: Gingrich's comments on torture. Olbermann said Gingrich was being hypocritical because his 2009 comments on interrogations conducted by the United States on terrorist extremists were not consistent with his comments from 1997 on torture in China. 
 

Gingrich then:

In 1997, Gingrich was House speaker when Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the United States. Gingrich was concerned about the persecution of religious minorities in China, and broached the topic in a meeting with Jiang.
 
He then released a statement about the meeting:
 
""Republican leaders made explicitly clear our unwavering commitment to human rights and individual liberty. I believe it was vitally important that we used this opportunity to address the basic lack of freedom — speech, liberty, assembly, the press — in China. ... As I said in China this spring, there is no place for abuse in what must be considered the family of man. There is no place for torture and arbitrary detention. There is no place for forced confessions. There is no place for intolerance of dissent.
 
""While we walked through the Rotunda. I explained to President Jiang how the roots of American rule of law go back more than 700 years, to the signing of the Magna Carta.""
 

Gingrich now:

Gingrich appeared on the Fox News Channel show

On the Record with Greta Van Susteren

on April 26, 2009, and said he wasn't sure whether waterboarding was torture.
 
""I honestly don't know,"" Gingrich told Van Susteren. ""I think it's debatable. Lawyers I respect a great deal say it is absolutely within the law; other lawyers say it absolutely is not in the law.""
 
Whether it's considered torture or not, Gingrich said waterboarding was ""something we shouldn't do.""
 
Gingrich explained that it might be warranted in extreme situations.
 
""I am exactly where Sen. (John) McCain was. Sen. McCain said there are very rare circumstances where extreme measures should be used. And those circumstances should be personally signed by the president as commander in chief. And a good example is if you pick up somebody who has planted a nuclear weapon in Washington or New York or Los Angeles or Atlanta and you're trying to find out in the next three hours, where is the nuclear weapon, the president of the United States may well authorize remarkably tough measures because 100,000 or a half million lives are at stake.""
 
(Finally, we should note that Gingrich's view that torture is sometimes acceptable is shared by many Americans. A recent Pew poll found that only 25 percent of respondents said that torture is ""never"" justified. Seventy-one percent felt that torture was justified rarely, sometimes or often.)
 
So, to measure the flip-flop: Gingrich in the past took a more absolute posture on prisoner treatment, saying that ""there is no place for abuse in what must be considered the family of man."" Now he appears to say that it is okay in extreme cases. If Gingrich had argued, like former Vice President Dick Cheney has, that ""enhanced interrogation"" is an effective technique and should be used without hesitation, we would be inclined to give him a Full Flop rating. But Gingrich seems to say that torture should be used only in special cases. So we'll give him a Half Flip.

Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer called the $2 trillion number ""transparently phony"" and a ""whopper,"" and we've seen similar criticisms elsewhere. So we decided to check it out.
 
Keep in mind that the deficit is a number that reflects income minus expenses over the course of a single year. At the end of Bill Clinton's administration, the government had a few years of surplus, but since then it's been running a deficit every year. Each year's deficit gets tacked on to the growing pile of public debt.
 
Obama's budget assumes the government's expenses will continue to exceed its income for the next four years. But it proposes policies that Obama says will make the deficit smaller. He claims the budget cuts the deficit in half over four years (a claim we found

Mostly True

) and cuts deficit spending by $2 trillion over 10 years.
 
When you talk about the deficit getting ""smaller,"" though, you have to ask, ""smaller compared to what?""
 
The answer: smaller than it would have been without Obama's proposed changes. The reductions depend on looking 10 years into the future and comparing Obama's proposal with what we would have spent if we continued with current policies. These projected numbers of current policies are called the baseline.
 
Obama's critics contend he's inflating the baseline. In particular, they say, Obama claims we would have spent a pile of money on ""overseas contingency operations,"" which means the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama's budget then posits that he wouldn't spend that much money, and he totals up the savings at $1.6 trillion.
 
The numbers get bigger the further into the future we go. In 2019, for example, Obama projects that he will save $187 billion than would have otherwise been spent on those ""overseas contingencies.""
 
We asked the White House's Office of Management and Budget how it came up with its numbers, but we didn't hear back.
 
We turned to several federal budget experts from across the political spectrum to see if they thought Obama was inflating the baseline.
 
Absolutely, said Brian Riedl, a senior policy analyst with the right-leaning Heritage Foundation.
 
""It's the equivalent to assuming an expensive vacation, then not taking it, and saying you've cut your family's budget,"" he said. ""To claim savings off that baseline is ridiculous.""
 
The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities also looked at the $2 trillion number and found it a bit inflated. Its research said a more realistic number for deficit savings was $900 billion, a little less than half of Obama's estimate.
 
Calculating the baseline can be an honest difference of opinion, said James Horney, the center's director of federal fiscal policy.
 
Obama's budget ""does a different thing, but I can't say it's wrong,"" Horney said.
 
Also, he pointed out, Obama's budget increases revenues by letting the Bush tax cuts expire on people who make more than $200,000 a year for singles or $250,000 for couples. The Obama budget document shows a deficit reduction of $636 billion over 10 years from those tax increases.
 
Obama's critics don't mention his deficit reductions due to the tax increases, Horney said.
 
""They don't tell you the next step, which is that he is still below current policy, because that is driven by ending the tax cuts that they support,"" he said.
 
We found yet another interesting perspective from the Heritage Foundation's William Beach, the director of their center for data analysis.
 
Beach said that the problem with Obama's budget is that he assumes he can reduce the spending on Iraq and Afghanistan at all. Beach thinks that's highly unlikely.
 
""Everybody who has said we can reduce costs in Iraq has been wrong, whether on the left or the right,"" Beach said. ""Everyone who goes in stays longer than they want to. It's almost like a budget trap over there.""
 
""Four years from now, Obama will be as intractably involved in Iraq and Afghanistan as he is today,"" Beach said glumly. ""I hope I'm wrong,"" he added.
 
So after hearing arguments from both sides, we agree with critics who say Obama is exaggerating his savings estimates. Even Sen. John McCain, Obama's opponent, said during the campaign that he would have brought home most of the troops in 2013 if elected president. So for Obama to estimate costs getting bigger and bigger for a full 10 years is a stretch.
 
On the other hand, it's very difficult to say how much of a stretch it is — after all, we're talking about numbers based on predictions about complex military and global events.
 
In one sense, Obama's statement is true. He

has

identified $2 trillion in deficit reductions. But presenting a budget figure 10 years out as a solid number is dicey. And people on both ends of the political spectrum say his numbers are exaggerated considerably. And we find it's significant that the estimate from the well-respected, left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is less than half of Obama's. So we find Obama's statement Barely True.

Obama says Venezuela defense budget 1/600th of the U.S.'s
","
President Barack Obama was criticized by conservatives recently for a couple of handshakes and photo opportunities with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez at the Summit of the Americas.
 
In a news conference after the summit, on April 19, 2009, Obama dismissed those critics, saying the Venezuelan military is not consequential enough to worry about.


According to the

Washington Post,

Obama said, ""Venezuela is a country whose defense budget is probably 1/600th of the United States. They own Citgo,"" the retail arm of Venezuela's national oil company.  ""It's unlikely that as a consequence of me shaking hands or having a polite conversation with Mr. Chavez that we are endangering the strategic interests of the United States.""
 
Chavez has significantly increased the Venezuelan defense budget in recent years, and so we wondered about the 1/600th figure.
 
First, the numbers. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Venezuela had a defense budget of $3.3 billion in 2008, up from $2.6 billion in 2007. By comparison the United States is spending $711 billion on the military this year, including the cost of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. So Obama is slightly underestimating the Venezuelan defense budget. It is actually about 1/215th the size of the United States'.
 
The size and firepower of U.S. defense forces also dwarf Venezuela's. But Chavez has made headlines in recent years for his efforts to ramp up and modernize the Venezuelan military, purchasing nearly $3 billion worth of assault rifles, fighter jets and helicopters from Russia. Venezuela also has made large defense purchases from Spain, Belarus and China, for everything from patrol boats and ammunition to radar systems for military air operations.
 
Even with that, Venezuela is still ""at best a second-rate regional power,"" said Larry Birns, director of the nonprofit Center on Hemispheric Affairs, which researches and reports on Latin American affairs.
 
""Historically, the Venezuelan military has been a fairly rag-tag outfit, heavily politicized and exceedingly corrupt,"" Birns said. Even with Chavez's efforts to improve the military, ""They just don't have the stuff that could pose a serious threat to the United States.""
 
According to a May 2007 analysis prepared by COHA research fellow Alex Sanchez, ""Even if Venezuela is upgrading its military more than other countries in its category, it is most likely doing so for defensive purposes. It would be ludicrous to believe that the country would launch any kind of military aggression against the U.S., shooting at Stealth bombers with rifles.""
 
So, yes, Obama's numbers were a little off. We're not going to ding him too hard for that, though, as his overall point is correct. And Obama's use of the word

probably

1/600th suggests it is more of a guestimate than a hard statistic. The Venezuelan military is indeed a tiny fraction of the size of the U.S. military. And so we rule his statement Mostly True.

"['National', 'Guns', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama claims 90 percent of guns recovered in Mexico come from U.S.
","
With growing violence on the U.S.-Mexico border fueled by powerful drug cartels, officials from both countries have been repeating a shocking statistic to suggest this isn't just a Mexican problem.


""This war is being waged with guns purchased not here but in the United States . . . more than 90 percent of the guns recovered in Mexico come from the United States, many from gun shops that lay in our shared border,"" President Barack Obama said on a visit to Mexico on April 16, 2009. ""So we have responsibilities as well.""


Obama joins many other U.S. and Mexican officials — from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the Mexican ambassador to the U.S. — who have cited versions of the 90 percent figure in arguing for greater U.S. intervention. For his part, Obama has pledged to commit more money and resources to stem the flow of guns south of the border.


But Obama, Clinton and others have left out important qualifiers when citing the 90 percent statistic, which originates from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The agency doesn't have statistics for

all

weapons in Mexico, where gun sales are largely prohibited; the figure is based on only guns that the Mexican government sent to the ATF for tracing and that the ATF found were traceable.
 
Along those lines, the number was cited correctly by William Newell, an ATF special agent who oversees the bureau's operations along border in Arizona and New Mexico, when he testified before a House subcommittee on March 24.
 
""In fact, 90 percent of the firearms recovered in Mexico, and which are then successfully traced, were determined to have originated from various sources within the continental U.S.""


Gun rights groups say the number has been widely and intentionally distorted to advance a gun control agenda.


And on April 2, 2009, Fox News ran a story on its Web site dismissing the statistic as a ""myth."" The article cites statistics from the Mexican government that suggest only about a third of the guns recovered at crime scenes in Mexico are submitted to the ATF for tracing; and it notes that many guns submitted to ATF cannot be traced. Therefore, the writers conclude, only 17 percent of guns found at Mexican crime scenes have been traced to the United States.
 
According to the article, ""a large percentage of the guns recovered in Mexico do not get sent back to the U.S. for tracing, because it is obvious from their markings that they do not come from the U.S."" The article goes on to say many weapons are coming from a wide variety of foreign sources including China, South Korea, Spain and Israel, as well as from the Russian mafia and other nefarious sources in Asia, South and Central America.
 
""Reporter after politician after news anchor just disregards the truth on this,"" National Rifle Association spokesman Chris Cox told Fox News. ""The numbers are intentionally used to weaken the Second Amendment.""


ATF officials challenge the suggestion that Mexico only sends them guns they suspect are from the United States. In fact, the ATF found about a quarter of the 90 percent were made in other countries and then taken illegally from the United States into Mexico.
 
So what does that mean about the accuracy of Obama's claim? Are the guns submitted to ATF a representative sample of all guns confiscated by Mexican authorities?


In an interview on CBS's

Face the Nation

on April 12, 2009, Arturo Sarukhan, the Mexican ambassador to the United States, stood behind the 90 percent figure.


""Ninety percent of all weapons we are seizing in Mexico ... are coming from across the United States,"" Sarukhan said. ""Just on the Arizona and Texas borders with Mexico alone there are approximately 7,000 (gun shops). And a lot of the weapons that are being bought by the drug syndicates, either directly or through proxy purchases are coming from those gun shops.""
 
Alberto Islas, a security consultant with Risk Evaluation in Mexico City, said the 90 percent figure is based on an incomplete sample. Mexican officials only require ATF traces of guns used in ""high-impact crimes,"" he said. That certainly includes crimes involving violent drug cartels. That's the sample from which the ATF derives its 90 percent statistic. Driving up that percentage, Islas said, is the fact that nearly all of the handguns traced by ATF come from the United States, Islas said, while assault weapons are more of a mixed bag — some come from the United States, but others come through drug routes in Eastern Europe, Africa and elsewhere.


When looking at all the weapons used in violent crimes in Mexico, Islas said the figure of 90 percent coming from the United States may be a bit on the high side, but he said the real number is certainly a lot higher than the 17 percent cited by Fox.


We think the ATF number, presented in its proper context, provides legitimate and useful information to weigh when considering U.S. policy. We find the implication that the number could be as low as 17 percent is unrealistic because it assumes that every gun that has not been traced comes from somewhere other than the United States. That's faulty logic.
 
But we think Obama also mischaracterizes the statistic some when he says 90 percent of the guns recovered in Mexico come from the United States. Not every gun recovered in Mexico is submitted to the ATF for tracing. And so Obama and others can't know exactly what percentage come from the United States. They can only speak to the guns successfully traced by the ATF. And so we rule Obama's statement Half True.

DHS report on right-wing terror risks more cautious than Bilirakis
","
Conservative groups have been sounding an alarm about a leaked report from the Department of Homeland Security they say portrays veterans and gun owners as likely terrorists.
 
The outcry began in the conservative media, with reports from Fox News and commentary from radio host Rush Limbaugh and conservative blogger Michelle Malkin. Republican members of Congress then joined in.
 
Here's a statement from Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., a member of the House Homeland Security Committee.
 
""I am disturbed and personally offended by the Department of Homeland Security's view that returning military veterans and gun owners are likely to commit terrorist acts,"" he said.
 
""Federal homeland security officials should focus on specific, verifiable and actionable intelligence to stop potential terrorist threats to our country. Instead the department is engaging in political and ideological profiling of people who fought to keep our country safe from terrorism, uphold our nation's immigration laws, and protect our constitutional right to keep and bear arms. It troubles me that the department has specifically avoided talking about foreign terrorism but seems more than willing to insult our nation's heroes returning from battle.""
 
The report was not supposed to be publicly available (""No portion . . . should be released to the media, the general public or over nonsecure Internet servers""). But somehow, it got released and is now widely available on the Web. (

Read it for yourself here

.)
 
The title is ""Right-Wing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment."" It's part of an ongoing series of intelligence assessments issued by a Homeland Security division that works with the FBI to analyze threats within the United States. The reports go to state and local law enforcement officials and are marked as not for release to the general public.
 
The report, dated April 7, 2009, begins by stating that it has ""no specific information that domestic right-wing terrorists are currently planning acts of violence, but right-wing extremists may be gaining new recruits. ... The economic downturn and the election of the first African-American president present unique drivers for right-wing radicalization and recruitment.""
 
A few sections down, the report says, ""The possible passage of new restrictions on firearms and the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks.""
 
The nine-page report then explores at greater length potential factors exacerbating right-wing extremism: the economy, the election of President Barack Obama, illegal immigration, gun control legislation, perceived threats from other countries (the ""New World Order"") and finally, ""disgruntled military veterans.""
 
The report says that ""right-wing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize returning veterans in order to exploit their skills and knowledge derived from military training and combat. These skills and knowledge have the potential to boost the capabilities of extremists — including lone wolves or small terrorist cells — to carry out violence."" The report mentions Timothy McVeigh as an example of a veteran who associated with an extremist group after Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1991. (McVeigh's 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City killed 168 people.)
 
On gun control, the report states that ""a correlation may exist between the potential passage of gun control legislation and increased hoarding of ammunition, weapons stockpiling, and paramilitary training among right-wing extremists."" But it also notes that ""law-abiding Americans"" may also make bulk purchases of ammunition.
 
Countering claims that the DHS is targeting conservatives is the fact that the department issued a similar report on left-wing groups a few months previously.
 
""Left-Wing Extremists Likely to Increase Use of Cyber Attacks over the Coming Decade,"" issued Jan. 26, 2009 (six days after Obama took office), said left-wing extremists include ""radical elements of the anarchist, animal rights, or environmental movements"" who are ""willing to violate the law to achieve their objectives.""
 
So it's important to note that since Obama took office, the DHS has warned about extremists from both ends of the spectrum.
 
Republicans seem to be the most vocal about the more recent report, but others have raised concerns about how the report described political opinion. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and the chair of the Homeland Security Committee, said in a letter to DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano that he was concerned about civil liberties.
 
""As I am certain you agree, freedom of association and freedom of speech are guaranteed to all Americans — whether a person's beliefs, whatever their political orientation, are extremist or not,"" he wrote. ""I am disappointed and surprised that the department would allow this report to be disseminated to its state, local and tribal partners in its present form.""
 
Napolitano said in a statement that the department was not targeting anyone's political views and monitored all types of extremist groups.
 
""We don’t have the luxury of focusing our efforts on one group,"" she said. ""We must protect the country from terrorism whether foreign or homegrown, and regardless of the ideology that motivates its violence.""
 
She also told CNN that the department had not intended to offend veterans.
 
""I know that some veterans' groups were offended by the fact that veterans were mentioned in this assessment. So, I apologize for that offense. It was certainly not intended. I'll be meeting with the leaders of some of those groups next week,"" she told CNN on April 16.
 
In another interview, Napolitano said that Republican leader John Boehner wants to make ""political hay"" out of the report.


""There has been a lot of spinning out there in Washington, D.C.-land, but all we're trying to say across is, look, there is situational awareness that needs to go on,"" she told NBC's Matt Lauer. ""These are routine reports. In fact, this one was begun months ago, before this new administration took office.""
 
This brings us back to Bilirakis' claim that DHS thinks that ""returning military veterans and gun owners are likely to commit terrorist acts."" This is a distortion of what the report actually said. The report said that right-wing extremists would try to

recruit

veterans, and that they would try to use gun control legislation as a ""radicalization"" tool. That's very different. We rate his statement Barely True.

Here's the scoop: Obama has worked in the ice cream business, among many others
","MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, pivoting off a Republican guest's suggestion that the Obama administration was not up to the work of governing, launched into a larger point about the president's work history. ""You know what else is hard work? Socialism,"" Scarborough said on the April 7, 2009,  Morning Joe  . ""And I'm not being negative toward the president. This is the truth though. Think about this. We've got a president who has never received a paycheck ... he's never received a check from a profitmaking business in his entire life, not one check. Think about it.""

It's true that Obama's most well-known jobs, as a community organizer and politician, have been for governments or nonprofit organizations. But Obama has worked for plenty of private companies, from Baskin-Robbins to Business International Corporation. He worked at law firms. He was a telemarketer. He worked construction. He sold island trinkets in Hawaii. In his diatribe, Scarborough remarked that ""if you're going to run the most complex financial sectors in the world, I hope that you have at least received a paycheck for working at a burger stand."" We're not sure whether the deli at which Obama worked as a young man in Hawaii sold burgers, but it's entirely possible.

Boehner says some want to scrap 401(k)s
","
In a press release touting a Republican plan to help restore savings lost in the plummeting stock market, House Republican Leader John Boehner suggests some Democrats want to wipe out 401(k)s in favor of government-run retirement savings program.
 
""Recent polling suggests that Americans’ concerns about their savings even trumps concerns about losing their jobs,"" Boehner said in a statement on March 24, 2009. ""Unfortunately, Washington Democrats have done nothing to address this savings crisis.  In fact, Washington is pursuing policies that are causing Americans’ savings to evaporate more quickly, and some even advocate wiping out 401(k)s entirely and replacing them with government-run accounts.  That’s unacceptable and not the solution Americans need at a time when they want to rebuild their retirement, college, and personal savings.""
 
So who are the ""some"" advocating such a dramatic overhaul of the American retirement savings system?
 
According to a spokesman for Boehner, he's referring to a professor who spoke before the House Education and Labor Committee on Oct. 7.
 
In a presentation on ""The Impact of the Financial Crisis on Workers' Retirement Security,"" Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economic policy at New York's New School for Social Research, said America's ""30-year experiment with 401(k) accounts has failed.""
 
About half of workers will not have enough in retirement to replace 70 percent of their preretirement income, she said, which is largely caused by a ""fundamentally flawed"" 401(k) program that has little regulation. She recommended Congress end tax subsidies for 401(k) plans in favor of ""guaranteed retirement accounts"" into which workers would be required to contribute 5 percent of their pay. The government would guarantee a 3 percent inflation-indexed return. And Uncle Sam would contribute $600 per worker, every year to those accounts.
 
Her idea doesn't have any significant support in Congress that we could find. About the closest to support that we heard was from George Miller, the California Democrat who chairs the committee. He is interested in some kind of major long-term reform to the retirement savings system, but has stopped short of calling for the elimination of the 401(k) system.
 
Two months ago, his committee held a hearing on strengthening worker retirement security. In his opening statement, Miller said ""the current economic crisis has exposed deep flaws in our nation's retirement system. For too many Americans, 401(k) plans have become little more than a high-stakes crapshoot,"" Miller said.
 
Miller did not discuss any specific changes, but over the long term, he said, we ""should ask ourselves whether our current system gives workers the ability to ensure a safe and secure retirement."" He emphasized the need to preserve and strengthen 401(k)s but also said the Congress must consider additional retirement options.
 
""In the short term, Congress must address ways to improve defined contribution plans,"" Miller said. ""The 401(k) needs to be more transparent, fair, and operated on behalf of the account holder, not Wall Street firms. But, we must also ask the difficult questions about the state of our nation's retirement system as a whole and look to see whether we need to create a new leg of retirement security.""
 
The

Wall Street Journal

blasted Ghilarducci's plan in a Nov. 14, 2008, editorial and criticized Miller for even entertaining her ideas. Conservative blogs also criticized the possibility that 401(k) plans be replaced by a government-run savings plan.
 
Miller fired back, accusing the

Wall Street Journal

of misrepresenting his efforts and ""needlessly creating fear among Americans rightly worried about their retirement security.""  
 
""I do not support 'abolishing' 401(k)s, moving these plans, or changing their tax status, plain and simple,"" said Miller. ""The truth is that Democrats in Congress are working to preserve and strengthen 401(k)s.""
 
Still, Miller's use of the phrase ""short term"" in February ""piqued the curiosity"" of Ed Ferrigno, vice president of Washington affairs for the Profit Sharing/401k Council of America, an association that represents employers that sponsor 401(k) plans.
 
""He (Miller) made it clear that his support of 401(k)s is qualified,"" Ferrigno said. ""I don't know what to read into that. It certainly could create a foundation for a system to overtake 401(k) plans.""
 
But there's been no support in Congress or the White House for the kind of wholesale change that Boehner mentioned, according to Ferrigno and our review of legislation and statements. To the contrary, Democrats have spoken of protecting 401(k)s.
 
In a speech on the economy at Georgetown University on April 14, President Barack Obama spoke of the need to enact rules to ""protect typical American families when they buy a home, get a credit card or invest in a 401(k).""
 
Yes, there are ""some"" in Washington who are tossing around the prospect of moving to a government-run system, and some of them may even want to scrap 401(k)s. But they are not elected officials and not in the Obama administration.
 
Our problem with Boehner's statement is that it seems to suggest the idea has gained traction with Democratic lawmakers and administration officials. Use of the word ""some"" may provide Boehner some wiggle room here ? he could probably safely say that ""some"" people in Washington may be advocating darn near anything ? but the context suggests Democrats are behind it.
 
We haven't found any, so Boehner's claim comes off sounding more like a scare tactic. And so we rate the statement Barely True.

Olbermann is right about base defense spending increase
","In response to Republican complaints that the Obama administration is gutting the military, MSNBC's Keith Olbermann fired back, saying that Obama is actually increasing defense spending.

""GOP lawmakers (are) falsely accusing the president of gutting the Pentagon’s budget, when in fact President Obama is actually increasing Bush-era defense spending by $21 billion in the new fiscal year,"" Olbermann said on his  Countdown  program on MSNBC.

Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced April 6, 2009, that he planned an overhaul of military spending, reducing the amount on big-ticket items such as the F-22 fighter plane and shifting more money toward new technology and troops. That led to Republican complaints that Gates was gutting defense, which in turn led to Olbermann's comments.

""Representatives in Congress  (are) wildly and falsely mischaracterizing that as making cuts to the military's budget,"" Olbermann said. ""A) Afghanistan and Iraq spending, that is all in a separate budget . You could look that up. B) In the final year of the Bush administration, the defense budget was $513 billion. In fiscal year 2010 it will be $534 billion. That would be more. In fact, it's an increase of $21 billion, not a cut. As they say, do the math.""

Olbermann grabs his figures straight from the Obama administration's  proposed 2010 budget  , which calls for a 4 percent increase in base funding for defense. That would, in fact, increase the base defense budget from the 2009 enacted level of $513.3 billion to $533.7 billion.

There are a couple caveats here.

Base defense spending does not include the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as Olbermann noted. Spending for the wars comes through supplemental budgets.

To calculate the cost of defense including the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan requires a little math.

During the first half of this fiscal year, President Bush secured $66 billion in supplemental funding for the wars, fully aware that a second supplement would be needed from the new president. Obama has requested an additional $83 billion supplement (although $7 billion of that is for foreign aid). So $142 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan in 2009. Together with base defense spending of $513 billion, it comes to total 2009 military spending of $655 billion.

Obama's proposed budget calls for $534 billion in base defense spending and estimates a ""placeholder"" amount of $130 billion to fund the wars overseas. Total estimated military spending for 2010: $664 billion.

That's a long way of explaining that if you include the costs of the wars, there's an overall $9 billion increase in defense spending under the Obama budget.

There's another caveat, said Todd Harrison, fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. Obama's base defense budget appears to include some things that in the past were included in supplemental war funding.

For example, Gates said $2 billion in his proposed budget to increase intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support for the war — including 50 Predator and Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles — would be permanently funded in the base budget.

As well it probably should, Harrison said. But for comparison purposes, it inflates the base military spending next year. Details of the defense budget have not yet been released, Harrison said, but he suspects there may be lots of other spending like that which would skew defense spending comparisons.

Brian Riedl, a research fellow in federal budget policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that while Obama's defense budget may go up a little, some parts of defense spending will go up while other parts go down. And, he said, Republican opponents may be right that procurement spending will go down even as the net defense budget goes up.

""The short answer is that they both may be right,"" Riedl said.

Marc Goldwein, policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, added that looking at next year's budget isn't the only test of whether the defense will be ""gutted"" as some have claimed. Many of the procurement changes proposed by Gates won't be felt for years, he said.

""It's hard to cut spending really quickly,"" Goldwein said. ""It would have very little effect in 2010. But it could have an effect going forward.""

There are lots of ways to calculate how much the nation spends on defense, and some methods can be skewed if you include the cost for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. So we think Olbermann was on pretty solid footing when he cited the budget numbers for base defense spending. But there's an important caveat because the 2010 cost may include things that weren't part of the 2009 number. We can't know exactly how much of that has happened because the administration has not released a detailed budget yet. So for now, we rule Olbermann's comment Mostly True.",/factchecks/2009/apr/13/keith-olbermann/olbermann-right-about-base-defense-spending/

Rush Limbaugh incorrect about Washington's religious views
","Radio host Rush Limbaugh, railing against a  Newsweek  cover that proclaimed ""The Decline and Fall of Christian America,"" called on no less than the Father of Our Country for backup. Limbaugh was talking to a high school teacher from Rochester, N.Y., on his show April 8, 2009, when he invoked the first president to support the argument that the United States is a Christian nation. ""Now, you've got people who want to conform and not cause any ripples, 'Oh, yeah, yeah, we're not a Christian nation, Judeo-Christian ethic, we are a lot of different religions here,' "" Limbaugh said. ""You can't read a speech by George Washington, you can't read his inaugural address, you cannot read them without hearing him reference God, the Almighty, and how this nation owes its existence to God and our thanks to God for the vision in founding this nation with people treated as he made them, the yearning spirit to be free and so forth."" To see whether you indeed ""can't read a speech by George Washington"" without seeing a reference to God, we checked Washington's most noteworthy speeches, starting with his two inaugural addresses, since Limbaugh mentioned those specifically. The  first inaugural address  , though lacking the word ""God,"" did contain plenty of references to a deity, such as one to ""that Almighty Being who rules over the universe,"" and a line about how ""no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of the United States."" But Washington's  second inaugural address  , the shortest on record, had no references to God, direct or indirect. Nor did Washington's Second Annual Message to Congress, the sort of speech that would come to be known as the State of the Union. Washington's famous speech at Newburgh to officers of the Continental Army, who were threatening to desert for lack of pay, also contained no references to God other than as an exclamation. ""My God!"" Washington said in a speech that came six years before he became president. ""What can this writer have in view, by recommending such measures?"" (That, and one other reference to the ""God of Armies,"" were the only two times in the 13 speeches we read that Washington used the word ""God."") So clearly Limbaugh was wrong that you can't read a Washington speech without seeing a reference to God. It's also worth noting, given Limbaugh's larger point that Washington's religious views support the idea that the United States is a Christian nation, that Washington was hardly a devout Christian. Peter Henriques, retired professor of history at George Mason University and author of the 2006 book  Realistic Visionary: A Portrait of George Washington  , said Washington's voluminous writings contain exactly one explicit reference to Jesus — when he told the natives of the Delaware Nation a decade before he became president: ""You do well to wish to learn our arts and ways of life, and above all, the religion of Jesus Christ. These will make you a greater and happier people than you are."" And in Washington's private writings, there's not one specific reference to Jesus, said Henriques, whose book includes a chapter devoted to Washington's religious views. Washington was fond of religion in general, saying in his farewell address to the nation in 1796 that of all the habits that lead to political prosperity, ""Religion and Morality are indispensable supports."" But he was also wary of religious sectarianism. He wrote of how religious disputes are ""the most inveterate and distressing,"" how he feared they would ""endanger the peace of society,"" and how he believed the Constitution established ""effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny."" Henriques said Washington was reluctant to spell out his own religious views, partly because he was ""trying to be a unifying symbol for everyone."" He believes Washington was best described as a ""rational theist,"" meaning he believed in God and elements of Christianity, ""but with a very strong dose of rationalism and reason."" Other scholars label Washington and most of the other founding fathers ""deists,"" meaning adherents of the 18th century movement that believed in God but emphasized morality. ""They were sort of products of the 18th century Enlightenment,"" said John Ferling, a retired professor at the University of West Georgia whose book,  The Ascent of George Washington: The Hidden Political Genius of an American Icon  , is due to be published in May. ""They thought in terms of there being a Supreme Creator who created life and the universe but then didn't intrude in things from that point on."" So Washington wasn't nearly the devout Christian that Limbaugh suggested he was and he did not refer to God in all his speeches as the talk show host claimed. We find Limbaugh's claim is False.",/factchecks/2009/apr/10/rush-limbaugh/Rush-limbaugh-washington-religion/

Maddow claims Palin got zero support for her idea, only it wasn't hers, and others supported it
","MSNBC host Rachel Maddow recently portrayed Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as plagued by personal problems and, on at least one high-profile issue, isolated politically. After running through the Palins' various family troubles, Maddow said on her April 6, 2009 show: ""And [it's] not just the personal stuff. Gov. Palin stumbled through the stimulus fight, rejecting federal money for Alaska before backtracking and taking it. Last week, she got precisely zero support for her call for Alaska's Democratic Senator Mark Begich to resign because Ted Stevens' corruption conviction was overturned."" It was that ""precisely zero"" that caught our attention. It so efficiently painted Palin as out of step politically with her fellow Alaskans. A little context: Stevens, a longtime Republican senator from Alaska, was convicted in October 2008 for omitting from his Senate financial disclosure forms free work done on his house by an oil-field services company. Days later, the 85-year-old narrowly lost his re-election bid to former Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich, a Democrat. Then on April 1, 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the government would move to dismiss Stevens' indictment, citing several instances of Justice Department prosecutors withholding evidence that should have been provided to the defense. A day later, Palin did indeed endorse the idea of Begich resigning so the state could have a do-over of sorts. But did Palin get ""precisely zero support"" for the idea? No. In fact, it wasn't even her idea in the first place. It was the Alaska Republican Party that suggested it. ""The only reason Mark Begich won the election in November is because a few thousand Alaskans thought that Senator Ted Stevens was guilty of seven felonies,"" the party said in a  press release  on April 2, 2009. ""A special election will allow Alaskans to have a real, nonbiased, credible process where the most qualified person could win, without the manipulation of the Department of Justice."" The  Fairbanks Daily News-Miner  then contacted Palin, who has often been at odds with Alaska Republican Party Chairman Randy Ruedrich, to ask what she thought of the idea. (Palin had called on Stevens to resign following his conviction in October.) ""I absolutely agree,"" she responded to the paper by e-mail. ""This drastic change in circumstances, wherein truth is finally being revealed, leads me to support the call for a special, fair election."" Later, in an interview with the  Anchorage Daily News,  Palin seemed to backtrack somewhat, saying she did not want to ""split hairs"" on whether Begich should resign but that she agrees with the call for a special election. No one in Alaska's three-person congressional delegation — made up of Begich and two Republicans — supported the calls for Begich to resign and a special election to be held, the  Anchorage Daily News  and the political news site Hotline   reported on April 3, 2009. But the idea was pushed by Randy Ruedrich, the state Republican chairman who first proposed it, and it was backed by conservative blogs. (Remember, Maddow said there was ""precisely zero"" support.) ConservativeHQ.com, for example, sent out an e-mail alert saying, ""The people of Alaska, and all Americans, must rise up and demand that Mark Begich resign."" Wev Shea, a former U.S. attorney now in private practice in Anchorage, did not specifically call on Begich to resign but he endorsed the idea of a special election and told the  New York Times,  ""There’s a groundswell all over the state for a special election."" So Maddow left her viewers with two incorrect impressions — that Palin had initiated the idea for Begich's resignation, and that no one else supported her. In fact, it wasn't Palin's idea, and she wasn't particularly wedded to it, and others supported it. We find Maddow's claim False.",/factchecks/2009/apr/10/rachel-maddow/maddow-claims-palin-got-zero-support-her-idea-only/

Columnist Will correct that initial TARP money did not buy toxic assets
","The Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, was envisioned as a giant pot of money the federal government could use to buy toxic assets, the mortgage-backed investments that triggered the nation's financial crisis. The idea was to buy the bad assets so banks would be in better shape to do more lending. That was the original vision of Henry Paulson, the Bush administration's treasury secretary and one of the architects of the plan. He won quick approval from Congress in early October 2008. But Paulson changed his strategy. Instead of using the early TARP money to buy the toxic assets, he decided to use it to invest in banks. That, Paulson said, would get them to resume lending.  Since then, critics have questioned whether the TARP money has been wisely spent. They have criticized TARP investments in banks that did not appear to be in serious trouble, and said it was unwise to spend $25 billion on the auto industry. In his column on March 24, 2009, conservative writer George Will took aim at a variety of recent acts by Congress and the Obama administration. He described members of Congress as ""braying yahoos"" and said the Obama administration had invited private sector investors to become business partners ""with the capricious and increasingly anticonstitutional government. This latest plan to unfreeze the financial system came almost half a year after Congress shoveled $700 billion into the Troubled Assets Relief Program, $325 billion of which has been spent without purchasing any toxic assets."" We had a vague recollection that TARP spending had been broadened at some point, but we wondered if Will was correct that such a large amount had been spent without buying the assets that were the original focus of the program. (Indeed, the program was named after them, creating a metaphorical acronym that suggested it was a temporary protection from storms.) A quick history: In early October, with fears that the economy was on the brink of collapse, Congress approved the $700 billion Paulson wanted, and President George W. Bush signed the measure into law. As we noted above, the early vision was to buy toxic assets. But just 10 days later, Paulson and the Bush administration changed the game plan. Instead of buying toxic assets, they said they would buy stock in American banks to put them on sound footing so they could resume lending. ""Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy,"" Paulson said on Oct. 14. ""We regret having to take these actions. Today's actions are not what we ever wanted to do – but today's actions are what we must do to restore confidence to our financial system."" Criticism grew. Some said Paulson had gotten too much leeway to spend the money. Congress began harrumphing and holding hearings, and oversight groups known as SIGTARP (the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program) and COP (the Congressional Oversight Panel) began to scrutinize the spending. (A quick aside: The financial crisis has spawned some of coolest acronyms this side of the Pentagon, making it possible for Treasury officials to utter sentences like, ""COP and SIGTARP have examined the TARP but haven't yet focused on the P-PIP."") The $325 billion cited by Will comes from the March 11 testimony by Neel Kashkari, the interim assistant secretary for financial stability who directs the TARP, before the Domestic Policy Subcommittee of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Asked about the status of the program and how much more would be needed, Kashkari said, ""We've deployed about 325 billion cash dollars out the door."" And at that point, none of the money had been spent on buying toxic assets, according to the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional research group, and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent group tracking spending on TARP and other stimulus programs on its site  Stimulus Watch.  We should note that since that testimony, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has unveiled his proposal for buying the toxic assets, which would be partly paid for by a portion of the TARP money. But that wasn't the case when Will's column was published, so we find his claim to be True.",/factchecks/2009/apr/09/george-will/columnist-will-correct-initial-tarp-money-did-not-/

O'Donnell alleges Gingrich laid off Bush, record indicates otherwise
","On a recent episode of MSNBC's  Countdown  with Keith Olbermann, liberal political analyst Lawrence O'Donnell accused Newt Gingrich of hypocrisy for criticizing President Obama. Gingrich had said on Fox News Sunday on April 5, 2009 that Obama had a ""fantasy foreign policy"" that emphasized diplomacy despite threats such as that from North Korea. A day later in an  online chat  the former House speaker said Obama's response to a recent North Korean missile test was ""a vivid demonstration of weakness."" Olbermann mentioned these criticisms, playing a clip of the first, then turned to O'Donnell for a response. ""Well, we don't have similar clips to show from 2006 in October, the last time North Korea launched one of these things under President Bush's watch,"" said O'Donnell, a former Senate staffer, Huffington Post blogger and executive producer of  The West Wing  . ""There are no similar clips of Newt Gingrich talking about how ineffective President Bush was in trying to control North Korea."" ""Yes,"" Olbermann said. We were less willing than Olbermann to take O'Donnell at his word. So we checked what Gingrich said in October 2006, after North Korea announced it had detonated a nuclear device. Here's Gingrich talking about the incident on  Hannity & Colmes  on Oct. 10, 2006: ""We may wake up one morning and lose Seattle or San Francisco or Atlanta or Boston,"" Gingrich said. ""And that's far too serious to just degenerate into pointing fingers at each other. And, yet, I don't sense any -- I don't sense any real willingness, and I say this about both parties. I mean, this would be a great moment for the president to invite all the senior Democrats in the House and Senate into a White House meeting to sit down and say, 'First of all, our analysts were wrong. Second, our intelligence didn't know where to look. We're not even certain the first weapon was a nuclear weapon.' The Japanese now report a second test. I mean, this ought to be seen as a very substantial crisis of national security."" ""I'm not defending the administration here,"" Gingrich emphasized later in the program. ""This is not a pro-Bush comment. I'm saying I think we, as Americans, are up against much more serious problems than we understand. And that we are faced with a threat that literally could cost us two or three cities in the next decade."" Here's Gingrich a week later on  The O'Reilly Factor  talking about national security: ""I think we have to demand dramatically more,"" Gingrich said. ""We may well have to spend more on national security. But the answer is not to become weaker than President Bush. The answer is to become stronger. I'm not at all comfortable, whether it's in Iraq, or in the intelligence service or dealing with North Korea or dealing with our own border. I'm not comfortable with where we are right now."" O'Reilly had not even asked specifically about North Korea. Later on the program Gingrich endorsed Bush's decision not to have one-on-one talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il. But still, in the above exchange, Gingrich went out of his way to suggest Bush was too weak with respect to North Korea. So there are at least two instances of Gingrich critiquing Bush's approach to North Korea -- exactly what O'Donnell said did not happen.

Daschle didn't say seniors should accept rather that treat conditions that come with age
","
Some chain e-mails remind us of a bad

Three's Company

episode. One roommate overhears something a little wrong and leaps to all sorts of misguided conclusions. Hijinks ensue.
 
The

latest chain e-mail

sent to us from a reader puts some words into the mouth of former Sen. Tom Daschle that raised our eyebrows. Daschle, you may recall, was once President Barack Obama's choice to be secretary of health and human services. He stepped down from consideration amid revelations about tax problems, but some think his fingerprints can be seen in some of the health provisions in the economic stimulus package signed by the president in February.
 
According to the e-mail (read the

full text here

), Daschle was quoted in a Bloomberg story saying, ""Seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them.""
 
We thought that sounded a bit impolitic, and fairly callous, for a former senator to say, and so we decided to check it out.
 
As with most e-mail claims, it starts with a grain of something.
 
Bloomberg did run a story about health provisions in the stimulus package on Feb. 9, 2009, under the headline

""Ruin Your Health With the Obama Stimulus Plan: Betsy McCaughey."" It was a commentary piece written by

Betsy McCaughey, former lieutenant governor of New York and an adjunct senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.
 
McCaughey warned that the stimulus included several troublesome provisions identical to ideas outlined by Daschle in his 2008 book,

Critical: What We Can Do About the Health-Care Crisis.

Midway through the article, McCaughey includes this paragraph:
 
""Daschle says health care reform 'will not be pain-free.' Seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them. That means the elderly will bear the brunt.""
 
We contacted McCaughey to see which parts of this were her words and which were Daschle's.
 
The phrase that health care reform ""will not be pain-free"" is a direct quote from Daschle, she explained.  She said the sentence beginning ""Seniors should be more accepting"" was her paraphrasing of an argument in Daschle's book in which he quotes David Mechanic, a health care policy expert at Rutgers University, saying, ""more and more of what were once seen as social, behavioral, or normative aspects of every day life, or as a normal process of aging, are now framed in a medical context. ... Whether wrinkles, breasts, or buttocks, impotence or social anxieties, or inattention in school, they all have become grist for the medical mill.""
 
We think it's a stretch to summarize Daschle's position as saying that seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them. Not treating wrinkles is one thing. Not treating, say, heart disease, is another. But that's fair enough for McCaughey to opine. This is labeled an opinion piece. The point is that these are McCaughey's words, not Daschle's.
 
The last sentence, ""That means the elderly will bear the brunt,"" was her conclusion, McCaughey said.
 
McCaughey said she is a meticulous scholar and ""I regret any misrepresentations made by others of my work or Mr. Daschle's views.""
 
Our efforts to reach Daschle for comment were not successful.
 
In the chain e-mail, quote marks are shifted, clouding the issue of who is actually speaking, and the e-mail suggests that Daschle actually said that.
 
The e-mail begins: ""Apparently, seniors are expendable — treating us is not worth the expense (unless you're a congressman!).
 
Then later:
 

Tom Daschle was credited today by Bloomberg with the following statement.


Bloomberg: ""Daschle says health-care reform will not be pain free.

Seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age

instead of treating them.""

 
The e-mail ends, urging, ""Please use the power of the Internet to get this message out. Talk it up at the grassroots level. We have an election coming up in one year and nine months. We have the ability to address and reverse the dangerous direction the Obama administration and its allies have begun and in the interim, we can make their lives miserable. Let’s do it!""
 
A few shifted quote marks make all the difference here. Instead of McCaughey's words, they become Daschle's. That kind of thing may have made for '70s sitcom gold, but here it just muddies the debate. We rule the claim in this e-mail False.

Cato Institutes claim on global warming disputed by most experts
","A recent full-page newspaper ad from the libertarian Cato Institute takes issue with President Barack Obama's convictions about global warming. The ad cites then-President-elect Obama's Nov. 19 statement: ""Few challenges facing America and the world are more urgent than combating climate change. The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear."" ""With all due respect, Mr. President, that is not true,"" the ad states in bold letters. Below that is a statement they say was signed off on by more than 100 named scientists. ""We, the undersigned scientists, maintain that the case for alarm regarding climate change is grossly overstated. Surface temperature changes over the past century have been episodic and modest and there has been no net global warming for over a decade now. After controlling for population growth and property values, there has been no increase in damages from severe weather-related events. The computer models forecasting rapid temperature change abjectly fail to explain recent climate behavior. Mr. President, your characterization of the scientific facts regarding climate change and the degree of certainty informing the scientific debate is simply incorrect."" Global warming is a complicated subject, and we're not going to flesh it all out here. But we did want to address the underpinning of this ad, the claim that ""there has been no net global warming for over a decade now."" First off, we should note that while there are some who disagree about the existence of global warming, the overwhelming consensus among scientists who study the climate is that it does, and that humans are worsening it. The definitive statement on global warming comes from a 2007 study by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists from more than 130 nations. They concluded that the ""warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level."" The group also concluded that there is ""very high confidence that the global average net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming."" The problem with the assertion in the Cato statement is that it is impossible to make meaningful conclusions about climate trends based on looking at a 10-year window, said Richard Heim, a meteorologist at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center Climate Monitoring Branch. People tend to think of global warming as a steady trend upward, Heim said, but that's not how it works. if you were to look at long-term trends, like a century, it looks more like steps. Temperatures wil rise for a few years, then level off or even go down a little bit, then go back up. That's why you've got to look at temperatures over many decades, he said. And if you look at the trends over the last 100 years, Heim said, ""the overall linear trend shows clear, unequivocal, unmistakable warming over that period."" Take a look for yourself at the  NOAA graph  of 100 years of global temperatures. Now, over the last dozen years, he said, global temperatures have largely plateaued. That's consistent with the trends. Typically, he said, climates will go up, then plateau until they reach a tipping point, and then rise again. ""What you are seeing in the last eight or 10 years is kind of like one of those steps,"" Heim said. ""The fact that it's not getting warmer doesn't mean we are not experiencing global warming. You can't talk about global warming over a 10 year period. The time scale is too short."" When you grab short time frames, say 10 years, it's easy to cherry-pick starting points that are particularly high or low to make your argument one way or the other. But even if you did select a 10-year frame — as cited by Cato — it would show a slight warming over time, Heim said. If you looked at just the last eight years, it would look flat. In fact, if you looked at the last four years, it would seem to be cooling. ""But this is crazy,"" Heim said. ""You have to look at the big picture."" Gavin Schmidt, a NASA climate scientist who was a reviewer on the IPCC study, called the Cato argument that there has been no global warming over the last 10 years ""fatuous and false.""

""What if I said that there had been no global warming for an hour? You would rightly tell me that this was too short a period for it to be meaningful,"" Schmidt said. ""The same is true for a 'decade'. But even so, it is false."" Schmidt directed us to a graph showing the 10-year climate trends using the four main temperature indices. The line bounces up and down like a lie detector graph, but the overall lines  all trend upward  . ""To be clear, the globe has warmed for the last decade,"" Schmidt said. ""You can get different results if you pick out your start dates carefully, a practice known as cherry-picking since it is trying to use the data
to say something other than what it generally shows, but you are much better off looking at the longest time scales you have (such as  these from NASA  )."" Cato cited a study on the internal variability of the climate system to support its claim. But the paper, from Kyle Swanson and Anastasios Tsonis, doesn't dispute the long-term trend of climate change, Schmidt said. He cited this conclusion from the paper: ""If the role of internal variability in the climate system is as large as this analysis would seem to suggest, warming over the 21st century may well be larger than that predicted by the current generation of models, given the propensity of those models to underestimate climate internal variability.""

Said Schmidt: ""Quoting this paper to support a claim that global warming has stopped is like quoting Ronald McDonald in support of vegetarianism."" In conclusion, most scientists who study climate say that cherry-picking a 10-year window is inappropriate. But in this case, cherry picking exactly 10 years (Cato said a decade) still doesn't support their claim. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2009/apr/01/cato-institute/cato-institutes-claim-global-warming-disputed-most/
