How many troops has Donald Trump sent to the U.S. border so far?
","President Donald Trump is preparing the border for the arrival of migrants from Central America planning to request asylum in the United States. Democrats are asking at what cost. ""15,000 troops will not see their families for #Thanksgiving because of @realDonaldTrump’s Scaravan Stunt,"" tweeted Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. ""Oh yeah, it’s also costing you 200 million dollars. Is it time to bring our troops home?"" The last question was a Twitter poll; 57 percent of the 137,000 Twitter users who responded said it was time. The Defense Department has sent thousands of troops to provide logistical support to the Department of Homeland Security, particularly Customs and Border Protection, at the Southwest border. The mission is expected to extend through Dec. 15. That would, as Swalwell tweeted, keep soldiers away from their families through Thanksgiving. The cost and troop size are in flux, but Swalwell’s estimate overshoots reality. Swalwell’s communications director Josh Richman told PolitiFact they took Trump’s word that 15,000 troops would be sent to the border. On Oct. 31, Trump told reporters: ""We have about 5,000. We'll go up to anywhere between 10 and 15,000 military personnel on top of border patrol, ICE and everybody else at the border. Nobody's coming in."" But 15,000 troops have not been deployed. As of Nov. 14, about 5,900 active duty troops have been sent in addition to about 2,100 National Guardsmen. The Defense Department anticipates the number to fluctuate between 5,500 and 7,000. ""It could drop down to 5,500, could rise to 7,000, depending on what they ask for at the border,"" said Lauren Hill, a U.S. Northern Command spokeswoman. Roughly 1,500 troops are currently stationed in California, 1,500 in Arizona and 2,800 in Texas, Hill said. That is about half of what Swalwell tweeted, when you include the National Guard. The Defense Department has not yet announced the total cost of the mission. ""We do not yet have a cost estimate for the operation,"" said Pentagon spokesman William Speaks. ""The DOD Comptroller is reviewing DOD accounts to fund this mission with minimal disruption to readiness and other DOD missions."" Swalwell’s office directed us to news articles that hovered around a $200 million estimate. A Washington Post report said military deployment costs ""could climb well above $200 million by the end of 2018."" That estimate summed up the cost of deployment of the National Guard and active duty troops. The report said the National Guard cost for this operation comes to $77 million, a quarter of what the Post reported National Guard deployment to the border would cost from October 2018 to September 2019. That roughly matches the $103 million Democrats reported the National Guard racked up since initial deployment in April. Travis Sharp, a research fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budget Assessments, calculated the cost of deploying active duty personnel for the report using the cost of the most recent comparable mission calculated by the Government Accountability Office, adjusted for inflation. Sharp estimated that deploying 15,000 active duty troops between Oct. 29 and Dec. 15 would cost between $90 and $110 million, landing the total cost at around $200 million. (Deployment of active duty troops is cheaper because they don’t require additional salary or benefits.) But fewer troops were deployed than Trump announced. When Sharp added the cost of the average number of active duty troops that have been deployed to date with the maximum estimate of 7,000 troops through Dec. 15, he found the cost would range between $42 and $52 million. That leaves us somewhere between $119 and $129 million. Swalwell said ""15,000 troops will not see their families for #Thanksgiving because of @realDonaldTrump’s Scaravan Stunt. Oh yeah, it’s also costing you 200 million dollars."" Trump floated deploying between 10,000 and 15,000 troops to protect the border. But the Defense Department estimates they will deploy a maximum of 7,000 troops through Dec. 15. That’s in addition to the 2,100 National Guardsmen who have been there since April. The cost of deployment has not been made public by the Defense Department, but Swalwell cited news stories placing the estimate near $200 million. Given the current troop numbers, the cost might be closer to between $119 and $129 million. That’s still pretty high.

Broward County elections supervisor Brenda Snipes is a Democrat, not a Republican
","Broward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes has found herself at the center of the election recount in Florida, where three statewide races remain undecided more than a week after Election Day. As the high-stakes recount has proceeded, Snipes has been maligned as a Democratic partisan who’s working to hand the election to her party. There’s no evidence of voter fraud or criminal activity. And according to NBC’s Andrea Mitchell, the notion that Snipes is trying to engineer a victory for Democrats is even more off-base because, as Mitchell claimed, Snipes is a Republican. ""We should also point out that Brenda Snipes in Broward County is a Republican appointed by former governor, then-Gov. Jeb Bush,"" Mitchell said Nov. 12. ""So she was put in by a Republican governor after the mess that we all remember from 2000. And she’s hardly a Democratic official, or someone doing the bidding of the Democratic candidates there."" Mitchell is wrong about Snipes’ party affiliation: She’s a Democrat. But, again, it’s important to note we’ve seen no evidence Snipes has done anything untoward on her party’s behalf during the Florida recount. Mitchell is apparently not the only person confused about Snipes’ political affiliation. In an interview with CNN, Snipes said she recently corrected someone who mistakenly believed she was a Republican: ""I was talking with a woman today, as she came into our office, and she made some statement — a partisan statement — and she said, ‘I know that you’re a Republican.’ I said, ‘I have been a Democrat all my life.’ In this position, I have been very focused on party, because I want to treat all of the voters in Broward County the same. And I think if you’d ask the voters, I have that reputation."" At look at Snipes’ biography on the Broward County supervisor of elections website also lists her as a Democrat.  Countless media reports also refer to Snipes’ Democratic affiliation. To take just one example, here’s an article from the South Florida Sun Sentinel about Snipes’ 2016 re-election bid, which references her party affiliation. ""Snipes, a Democrat, was appointed by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in 2003, after he removed her predecessor Miriam Oliphant,"" the 2015 article reads. ""Snipes went on to win three elections."" Snipes went on to win the 2016 Democratic primary by a whopping 53 percentage points. PolitiFact also referenced Snipes’ Democratic affiliation in a fact-check we wrote during the 2016 presidential election. We attempted to reach Mitchell through a press contact for her NBC show but did not hear back. Mitchell said Snipes is a Republican. That’s wrong. Snipes describes herself as a lifelong Democrat, and references in government documents and countless media reports back up this affiliation.

No, Obama's endorsements were not the kiss of death
","The claims keep rolling in after the historic midterm election came to a close across the United States. On Facebook, one in particular targets President Obama, questioning his help – or lack thereof – stumping for Democratic candidates. The Nov. 7 post has been shared more than 2,500 times and claims that ""every single candidate"" the former president campaigned for lost their races in the election. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While we found that several candidates Obama supported on the campaign trail did indeed lose, it certainly wasn’t all of them. Obama endorsed more than 300 Democratic candidates in federal and state races across the country, according to National Public Radio. Because the Facebook post specifically says ""campaigned,"" those are the races we will focus on. From what we could find, the former president traveled around the U.S. and campaigned for dozens of candidates. While some experienced losses, many also experienced wins; such as Jacky Rosen, who won a Senate seat in Nevada; Tony Evers, who won the governorship in Wisconsin and Sen. Tim Kaine, who won re-election in Virginia. The post cites and quotes an opinion story from the Washington Examiner. However, nowhere in that story does it say that ""all"" the candidates Obama stumped for lost. But it did highlight three: Andrew Gillum, Sen. Bill Nelson and Stacey Abrams. But even those losses are far from set in stone. We'll explain. In Florida, a state known for razor-thin election margins, several recounts are underway including for Gillum and Nelson. On election night, Gillum was trailing Republican Ron DeSantis in the race for governor by 77,377 votes when he called DeSantis to congratulate him. But the votes were still being counted. Similarly, Nelson, the Democratic incumbent, was trailing Republican Gov. Rick Scott by a small margin when Scott declared victory just after midnight. Again, the votes were still being counted. By Friday, Nov. 10, with unofficial election results finally in from every Florida county, the Democratic candidates in both races were behind by very small counts: DeSantis was leading Gillum by 0.41 percent, or 33,684 votes; and Scott was leading Nelson in the Senate race by 0.15 percent, or 12,562 votes. That’s when Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner ordered a statewide machine recount of over 8.2 million ballots in races for three races, including U.S. Senate and governor. Florida law requires an automatic machine recount in any race where the margin of victory is within one half of one percentage point. In Georgia, it’s not quite as close, but Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is not conceding. Republican challenger Brian Kemp, who had been the Georgia’s Secretary of State for eight years leading up through last week’s election, resigned his position overseeing the state’s elections on Nov. 8, two days after Election Day, when it became clear his margin of victory could be small enough as to force a runoff. By Monday night, unofficial returns showed that Kemp was leading by about 58,000 votes. But questions about the state’s handling of provisional ballots and voter registration system led a federal judge to order a delay in certifying the results until officials conduct a formal review of those issues. A Facebook post claims that every candidate Obama hit the campaign trail for lost in Tuesday’s election. That’s just plain wrong. Obama did rally for Democratic candidates who ended up losing, but the same goes for several others he supported who won their races.

Donald Trump Jr. tweets misleading 2012 headline about Florida noncitizen voters
","As President Donald Trump floated baseless claims about fraud in the counting of ballots in Florida, his son chimed in on Twitter to imply that the state had a huge number of noncitizen voters. ""Amazing, but not shocking at all anymore. Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Nearly-200000-Florida-Voters-May-Not-Be-Citizens-151212725.html … via @nbc6,"" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted on Nov. 12. Amazing, but not shocking at all anymore. Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens https://t.co/8HiObPLeeM via @nbc6 The tweet drew more than 28,000 likes in less than 24 hours. But it isn't accurate. It is based on a cherry-picked number from a headline that didn’t tell the full story back in 2012. At the outset of the state’s effort to purge noncitizens from the voter rolls, state officials came up with the list of about 182,000 names. But Trump Jr. omits that the final number of noncitizens purged was a tiny speck of that original number. When examined in the context of all the registered voters — or even ballots cast — in Florida or the nation, proven voter fraud by noncitizens is rare. Florida engaged in a controversial attempt to search for noncitizen voters leading up to the 2012 election. The search was rife with errors, and was ultimately dropped after few were found. Shortly after Republican Gov. Rick Scott took office in 2011, he asked his top election official at the time to look into removing noncitizens from the voter rolls. By 2012, the Division of Elections put together a list of potential noncitizens based on driver’s license data. Trump cited a headline from early in that process. He linked to a May 2012 story on NBC Miami’s website headlined: ""2012Election: Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens."" The story was written by the Associated Press. Why was the president’s son sharing a six-year-old story? Matthew Gertz of the liberal Media Matters website noted that before Trump Jr.’s tweet, conservative pundits publicized the 2012 story. David Wohl, the father of conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl, tweeted a link to the story on Nov. 10, as did Harlan Hill and Charlie Kirk. On Nov. 12 before Trump Jr.’s tweet, NBC Miami included an editor’s note on top of the original story. First, it reminded readers that the story was published in 2012. Then, it went over the history lesson of how the state’s list contained errors: The AP had reported that the initial list turned up nearly 182,000 people who may not be U.S. citizens, based on the driver’s license data. Of that group, the state sent an initial list of more than 2,600 voters’ names to county election supervisors. As we have reported and the NBC editor’s note points out, the state ultimately whitted the list and removed 85 voters because they were ""not a U.S. citizen."" Supervisors had noted all sorts of errors and later used words such as ""sloppy"" and ""embarrassing"" to describe the state initiative, PolitiFact found. One of the problems was that the driver’s license data doesn’t get updated when a legal resident later becomes a citizen. By September 2012, when the Division of Elections produced a new list of about 200 ineligible voters, supervisors were fed up, and the effort appeared to fizzle as the presidential election drew near. The state said it would launch yet another effort to purge noncitizens from the voter rolls almost a year later, but scrapped it. We were unable to find any other sort of comprehensive data on noncitizen voters removed in Florida. We reached out to the state Division of Elections but did not hear back by deadline. Jason Snead tracks proven instances of election fraud in the U.S. for the conservative Heritage Foundation, which includes cases that resulted in criminal convictions, fines or an official finding of fraud. He said the database shows 13 entries from Florida involving a noncitizen who successfully registered and/or voted in an election. These cases were from 2003-06. A May 2017 report by New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice found that election officials in 42 jurisdictions referred an estimated 30 incidents of suspected noncitizen voting for further investigation or prosecution out of more than 23 million votes. ""The kind of instances in which an individual voter tries to pretend to be somebody else or votes when he or she isn’t eligible are not the statistically meaningful events that we need to be worried about,"" Myrna Pérez, director of the center’s Voting Rights and Elections project and co-author of the study, said to the Austin American-Statesman. As Florida underwent a recount of three key races, Trump Jr. tweeted a headline that said ""nearly 200,000 Florida voters may not be citizens."" He said it was ""amazing, but not shocking at all anymore."" It’s actually not true, and years old. The story itself provides a more complete picture — and an editor’s note with clarifications that Trump overlooked. The state’s 2012 voter purge started with a list of potentially 182,000 noncitizens on the voter rolls. State officials whittled that list to more than 2,600 names sent to county election supervisors. Ultimately 85 noncitizens were removed.

No evidence Democrats and their allies ‘manufacturing voters’ in Florida recount
","A recount is underway in Florida, where three statewide races remain undecided a week after Election Day.

""The forces on the left, the Democrats and their allies, are trying to push this to what I call within the margin of litigation,"" Ken Blackwell, a former Republican Ohio secretary of state, said during an appearance on Fox News’ Tucker Carlson Tonight. ""They are manufacturing voters. And they're doing it with an architect, Superintendent (Brenda) Snipes, who has a record of gross incompetence and fraud."" We previously looked at the Broward election supervisor's track record. Here, we found no evidence to support the claim Democrats and their allies and manufacturing voters. Florida law stipulates that races separated by razor-thin margins trigger mandatory recounts. By law, a recount was implemented in the too-close-to-call governor’s race between Republican Ron DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum, where DeSantis’ winning margin was less than 0.5 percent. A recount is underway in the Senate race between outgoing Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, who trails Scott by less than 0.25 percent. The contest for state agriculture commissioner is also under recount. Blackwell accused Democrats and their allies of fraud during an appearance on Fox News on Nov. 9, three days after polls closed, but while votes were still being counted. It’s unclear exactly what Blackwell meant with the term ""manufacturing voters,"" and he did not respond to our request for comment. According to David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a non-profit focused on election integrity, the claim is baseless. ""There’s zero evidence to support these allegations,"" Becker said. ""It’s unfortunate that some extreme partisans will work so hard to delegitimize our elections process just to win an election."" Eugene Pettis, an attorney representing Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes in election-related litigation, dismissed Blackwell’s comment as ""political noise."" ""Unfortunately it’s not advancing the integrity of our electoral system,"" Pettis said. ""If you have  evidence of fraud put it on the table and notify authorities.

Claim that George Soros is giving migrants debit cards has no collateral
","Conservative bloggers have been working overtime to link liberal philanthropist George Soros with the thousands of Hondurans who have left the country and are trying to get to the United States. Once such attempt, with headlines such as ""Soros Provides Migrants With Prepaid Debit Cards To Fund Illegal Journeys,"" was posted on News Punch Nov. 5. But the story doesn't talk about the Honduran migrants. Instead, it says that Soros has been helping out migrants coming to Europe from Syria and other countries. ""The European migrant crisis is being fueled by free cash handouts from the United Nations, European Union and George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, according to bombshell information from Europe which suggests the UN, EU and Soros are luring illegal migrants to the continent with money,"" News Punch says. The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The ""bombshell information"" link sends readers to a Slovenian website called nova24tv.si and an Oct. 30 story expresses alarm over Muslim migrants coming into Europe. It questions where the migrants are getting their money and focuses on prepaid debit cards that carry the MasterCard logo and have been given to migrants. The Nova24TV story says they are paid for by the U.N.'s World Food Program. But there's no mention of Soros as a source of the cards. Instead, the Nova24TV story asks, ""Does the EU, directly with taxpayers' money, finance the violence that the Islamic invasion brings with it to European countries?"" The blue cards carry the logo of The UN Refugee Agency and a case study evaluating how well the card was helping refugees, found on the ReliefWeb.int website, doesn't mention Soros or a Soros organization. So why is Soros being pegged with providing these cards? Nearly two years ago, Soros and Mastercard announced ""plans to explore creating a social enterprise to apply commercial strategies to deliver a positive impact on society. Called Humanity Ventures, the enterprise could catalyze and accelerate economic and social development for vulnerable communities around the world, especially refugees and migrants."" The Jan. 19, 2017 news release isn't specific about what programs Soros' Humanity Ventures would try, but the bloggers are making the connection without offering any evidence. In fact, it's clear from the ""bombshell"" source News Punch is citing that by time the Soros-Mastercard agreement was announced, the UN Refugee Agency prepaid debit cards had been around for at least four years. The Nova24TV story says that a Mastercard website was reporting that 300,000 people in places like Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt had received the cards by the end of 2013 and Mastercard ""wanted to distribute 2.5 million such cards to be used in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey"" by the end of 2014. The website Inside Philanthropy reported shortly after the announcement that Humanity Ventures, a for-profit organization, ""plans to combine existing global health and development solutions to expand access to healthcare and education, as well as to improve local economic development and entrepreneurship. An additional goal of the organization is to improve the delivery of humanitarian aid."" So has the Soros initiative included adding money to some of those prepaid Mastercards to migrants in Europe? Soros spokesman Michael Vachon said in an email the claim is false. MasterCard and the philanthropist ""have been in discussions about joint investment opportunities,"" he said. ""None has reached fruition so far."" Without that connection, this debit card claim is overdrawn.

Post on elected Dems draws on unsubstantiated claims
","Democrats may have won a majority of seats in the U.S. House, but some bloggers don’t think the party has much to brag about. ""Democrats just elected… a woman whose IQ is lower than a salamander, a man who preys on underage prostitutes, an anti-semitic, America-hater who married her brother, and an anti-semitic who beats women,"" reads a Facebook post that appeared online Nov. 7. ""Y’all must be so proud."" The text flanks the pictures of four victors in Tuesday’s election: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a representative- elect from New York; Bob Menendez, an incumbent senator from New Jersey; Ilhan Omar, a representative-elect from Minnesota; and Keith Ellison, a congressman from Minnesota elected as the state’s attorney general. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared nearly 17,000 times. We feel that the allegation about Ocasio-Cortez’s IQ is hyperbole, and after looking into other claims about Omar’s marital history, we don’t have enough information to make a ruling, though the Associated Press has done a lot of reporting on the subject in response to the allegations. Instead, we’ll check whether Menendez ""preys on underage prostitutes"" and if Ellison is ""an anti-semitic racist who beats women."" First, let’s look at Menendez. An Oct. 15 political ad from his Republican opponent, Bob Hugin, accuses Menendez of being a hypocrite. ""What about the underage prostitutes who accused you, according to the FBI?"" the narrator says. The charge is an old one from Menendez’s last re-election campaign in 2012. It stems from an anonymous tip that Menendez and his friend, Salomon Melgen, hired underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic. Menendez has denied the allegations and, the New York Times reported on Oct. 17, ""it has never been proven."" The FBI investigated the claims. ""The government took responsible steps to investigate these serious criminal allegations, which were not so ‘easily disprovable,’ as the defendants suggest,"" according to court documents. But Washington Post reporter Salvador Rizzo, who traveled to the Dominican Republic in 2013 in part to investigate the underage-prostitution allegations, recalls that the FBI ""and a platoon of reporters from national and New Jersey news organizations spent months investigating whether the senator was committing sexual crimes with minors outside the country. The accusations were never substantiated."" Rizzo also talked to Melanie Sloan, a former Democratic congressional aide and a former federal prosecutor: ""I can tell you definitively that there was no evidence ever to support the underage-prostitution allegations,"" she said. In a comprehensive fact-check of the Hugin’s ad, Rizzo finds that ""to accuse a rival candidate of maybe sleeping with underage prostitutes, solid evidence is an absolute must. The evidence for Hugin’s ad fails the test."" This Facebook post fails the test, too. But what about Ellison? An old tie to Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader with a history of making anti-semitic remarks, dogged the congressman during his campaign. As a law student at the University of Minnesota, Ellison wrote an article for the school newspaper that ""defended Farrakhan against accusations of anti-semitism,"" according to a Washington Post story from 2006. He renounced the Nation of Islam that year, when he first ran for Congress. In 2016, a spokesperson for Ellison told CNN that he ""rejects all forms of anti-semitism."" The congressman also wrote an opinion piece for the Post declaring that he ""neglected to scrutinize the words"" of Farrakhan, ""who mixed a message of African American empowerment with scapegoating of other communities."" ""These men organize by sowing hatred and division, including anti-semitism, homophobia and a chauvinistic model of manhood,"" Ellison wrote. ""I disavowed them long ago, condemned their views and apologized."" Others maintain that Ellison made anti-semitic statements himself. In a 2017 opinion piece for The Hill, Alan Dershowitz, an emeritus law professor at Harvard University, wrote: ""A prominent lawyer, with significant credibility, told me that while he was a law student, Ellison approached her and said he could not respect her, because she was a Jew and because she was a woman who should not be at a law school."" Ellison has denied that he’s anti-semitic. He’s also denied more recent allegations that he abused his ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan. She’s accused the congressman of physical and emotional abuse. Once, she said, he shouted profanities at her while trying to drag her off the bed, the New York Times reported in August. Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer Labor Party hired a law firm to investigate and ""found the allegations unsubstantiated,"" according to Politico. There’s a lot to unpack here. The allegations in this Facebook post range from the absurd—comparing Ocasio-Cortez to an amphibian—to the incendiary. But all of the claims, including the ones we didn’t check, are misleading because they’re presented as if they are uncontested facts, and that’s not the case. The burden of proof is high in claiming someone paid a minor for sex, and in the case of Menendez, that proof is missing. The allegations against Ellison are murkier. We know that, while in law school, Ellison wrote an  article defending Louis Farrakhan against claims that Farrakhan was anti-semitic. Ellison then went on to renounce the Nation of Islam while also addressing those criticisms head-on in an opinion piece for the Washington Post. It seems clear that while this claim contains an element of truth, it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. As to the claim that Ellison ""beats women,"" we know that Ellison has not been convicted of assault in a court of law. However, his former partner hasn’t backed down from claims that he harmed her in what was clearly a volatile relationship. Without more evidence, it is hard to rule on this matter. Still, the claim does not come out of nowhere. While it contains an element of truth, this claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Together, the charges in this post are problematic and, in the end, range from incindiary to largely unsubstantiated.

Lone gunman, burned mattresses fuel violent caravan claim
","As a caravan of migrants makes its way toward the United States, narratives continue to emerge that depict participants as violent invaders. An Oct. 31 Facebook post from the Conservative Daily Post carries the headline, ""Just In: Migrant Invaders Set Fire To Facility, Open Fire On Police."" Clicking the link takes readers to a story on conservativedailypost.com with the headline, ""Caravan Violence: Invaders Shoot At Police, Set Fire To Immigration Checkpoint; The violence is ratcheting up as firearms, firebombs and rocks are being used by the caravan."" The website says the story has been shared over 3,300 times. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Several elements of this story suggest that it is factually challenged. It’s hard to find a lot of information about the referenced arson, but here’s what we know. A link in the Conservative Daily Post story takes readers to an Oct. 30 Breitbart report that, in turn, relies on an Oct. 29 story from Televisa News, which says a fire broke out in the area of an immigration checkpoint in Pijijiapan, Chiapas, which is located in Mexico, 90 miles by road to the Guatemalan border. The Televisa News story does not say when the fire happened. At the time of the arson, the checkpoint was housing 21 men who were being detained and awaiting deportation to Guatemala, the Televisa story says. The fire caused minor damage and no injuries. In addition, according to Televisa, the fire seems to have been caused by one or more migrants who had already left the caravan and were planning to go home, but were detained by Mexican officials. Though the date of the fire is not included in the story, we know based on news reports, including the timeline in this USA Today story, that the beginning of the caravan was about 90 miles from Pijijiapan on Oct. 28, the day before the story was first published online -- and at a time when the caravan was traveling about 40 miles per day. Additionally, the photograph that accompanies the Conservative Daily Post story shows a U.S. Border Patrol facility at night, a stock image found on Shutterstock and other stock image sites. The caption reads, ""An immigration checkpoint facility was set on fire and police were shot at as the migrant invasion force becomes more violent."" Together, the image and caption could give the impression that the arson happened at a U.S. border facility, which is not what the Televisa story states. A Nexis search of U.S. news and wire clips for the period of Oct. 12, when the first caravan formed, to Nov. 7, turned up no stories about an arson at a border checkpoint. Conservative Post Daily says the shooting occurred when two men ""saw the officers guarding the group of trespassers and decided to open fire."" Trespassers refers to the migrants. The best information we have about this incident indicates there was only one gun. An Oct. 29 statement from the Ministry of the Interior says only one of the two Hondurans was armed and the man fired while attempting to flee from police. The news release does not suggest why the pair, ages 22 and 17, were fleeing or why they would shoot officers guarding the caravan. The gun jammed with nine .380-caliber bullets still in the weapon. Nobody was hurt. The location of the shooting: the town of Ignacio Zaragoza in Chiapas, Mexico, near the Guatemalan border where a second caravan was forming and roughly 230 miles from the leading edge of the main caravan. The Conservative Daily Post reported, ""Caravan Violence: Invaders Shoot At Police, Set Fire To Immigration Checkpoint."" Combined with the photograph of a U.S. border patrol facility, it gives the false impression that the fire and shooting involved U.S. officials and an American facility. The evidence shows it did not. The fire was in southern Mexico, it was reportedly caused by men who had left the caravan and were returning south, but were detained by Mexican officials. There were no ""invaders"" (meaning more than one person) shooting at police, unless it took both of the arrested males to fire the same gun. If they were part of the caravan, it's not clear why someone would shoot at police guarding them. And the incident occurred in Mexico far from the U.S. border. Because the statement contains elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/nov/13/blog-posting/guns-burned-mattresses-fuel-violent-caravan-claim/

Rep. Rob Wittman says 85 percent of immigrants skip their court hearings
","Rep. Rob Wittman, R-1st, says the United States’ process for screening migrants at the Mexican border and granting asylum is ""broken.""   Under laws, migrants who enter the U.S. can prolong their stay by contesting deportation orders or requesting asylum. They are often assigned court dates for the disposition of their cases and released in the United States. Most of them go on the lam, Wittman contends. ""As you know, 85 percent of them don’t show up for a scheduled court hearing or schedule a court hearing,"" he said during a Nov. 2 radio interview on the John Fredericks Show from Portsmouth. Wittman’s statement comes as thousands of Central Americans are moving in caravans through Mexico with hopes of getting asylum in the United States. President Donald Trump has deployed 5,600 troops to the U.S.-Mexican border and ordered that asylum be denied to migrants who do not enter through official border crossings. We wondered if Wittman is right that 85 percent of immigrants don’t show up for their court dates. Data kept by Department of Justice refutes his claim. Twenty-eight percent of migrants released in the U.S. didn’t show up for their hearings during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2017, according to the latest DOJ records. Of the 149,436 immigrants that were released in the U.S. during that time, 41,384 were no-shows. Over a five-year period through the end of September 2017, the records show 23 percent of undocumented migrants released in the U.S. didn’t show up to legal hearings. Of the 665,930 immigrants who were released,151,492 were no-shows. Not all of these people sought asylum. Some were unaccompanied children who came to the border, and others were migrants seeking to join family members already in the U.S. And many of the no-shows were people who were detained at the border and then released in the U.S. because three weeks later because severely strained immigration courts couldn't get to their cases. Those seeking asylums - also called asylees - have been the most cooperative group; 11 percent of them didn’t go to their hearings in fiscal 2017. DOJ records show that 43,013 people seeking asylum had court hearings scheduled in 2017, and 4,776 didn’t show up, Over a five-year period, 10.1 percent of asylees were no-shows. There were 130,092 hearings scheduled, and 13,130 people didn’t come. Not everyone accepts the DOJ figures. The Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors stricter immigration laws, says the federal government is undercounting the no-shows and, in a 2017 study, contended that 37 percent of immigrants during the previous 20 years missed their court dates. We called Wittman’s office and asked where he got his 85 percent figure. The next day, he appeared again on The John Fredericks Show and retracted his claim, offering the center’s figure in its place. Wittman said he got the 85 percent statistic in 2014 from Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., also cited Goodlatte in 2014 as the source of his statement that 90 percent of immigrants who cross the border don’t attend their court hearings. PolitiFact rated that claim False. Goodlatte’s office has cited an article in Newsmax, a conservative online publication, as the source of the four-year-old ""anecdotal"" statement. The article referred to an anonymous ""senior Los Angeles County Sheriff’s detective who routinely deals with illegal immigrants"" and said ""a massive number — 80 to 90 percent"" don’t show up for deportation hearings. Despite its debunking, the high figures are frequently cited. Trump, during Oct. 31 remarks at the White House, said ""a level like 3 percent"" of immigrants show up for their trials. Our ruling Wittman said ""85 percent"" of immigrants in the U.S. don’t show up for their court hearings.  The actual percentage is far lower. DOJ statistics show 28 percent of migrants didn’t keep their court dates in 2017 and 11 percent of asylees didn’t show up. Even a think tank that says DOJ undercounts the no-shows comes nowhere close to the 85 percent figure. Wittman deserves credit for acknowledging his mistake - the day after we contacted him - on the same radio show that he made the statement. But his original claim of 85 percent has been circulating for years and we rate it False.    ",/factchecks/2018/nov/13/rob-wittman/rep-rob-wittman-says-85-percent-immigrants-skip-th/

Marco Rubio says Broward elections office has history of breaking the law
","As Florida headed toward multiple recounts, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., went on a Twitter tear directed at Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes. Rubio took aim at the supervisor in one of Florida’s blue bastions as the county was still tabulating ballots more than 40 hours after the polls closed. Big races for U.S. Senate, governor and state agriculture commissioner hung in the balance. ""#Broward elections department has a history of violating the law,"" Rubio tweeted Nov. 8, linking to Politico articles about two lawsuits filed against the office since 2016. Hours later, there was yet another lawsuit filed against Snipes, this time from Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate. A Broward judge ruled in Scott’s favor and found Snipes was in violation of Florida public records laws for not fulfilling a record’s request by Scott’s campaign. Is Rubio right about Broward’s past of election problems? Former Gov. Jeb Bush appointed Snipes, a former school principal, to replace Miriam Oliphant. Oliphant was removed from office amid mismanagement in 2003 following a string of problems in the 2002 primary election. Snipes initially drew praise for cleaning up the office and has repeatedly won re-election. But in recent years, she has faced scrutiny about her competence amid a series of lawsuits, errors and sluggish vote counting. Broward’s left-leaning electorate is key in statewide races because it has the second-largest number of registered voters with nearly 1.2 million, behind Miami Dade.   The lawsuits that Rubio cited were filed in 2017. Snipes lost both lawsuits and has appealed them. One lawsuit was filed by Tim Canova after he lost a Democratic primary to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz in 2016. Canova, concerned about the integrity of the election, wanted to inspect the paper ballots after he lost. He said she refused to comply, and he sued. Snipes testified that her office had destroyed the ballots after she signed an order Sept. 1, 2017 to authorize destruction of boxes. But under federal law, ballots are supposed to be preserved for 22 months. Broward Judge Raag Singhal ruled in May against Snipes, finding ""premature destruction of the records unlawful and in violation of the Public Records Act."" Following the ruling, the state announced it would send election experts to monitor her office. The other lawsuit was filed by the Republican Party of Florida in 2017 and pertained to Snipes’ procedures for opening mail-in ballots. GOP poll watchers said in 2016 her office opened mail in ballots in private. In August before the 2018 primary, Singhal issued a declaratory injunction that prevented Snipes from opening the ballots before the county’s Canvassing Board met. However, Singhal wrote that the lawsuit pertained to handling of ballots in future elections, and not whether Snipes violated state law in past elections. We sent the judges’ findings in both lawsuits to experts on elections law and government. Chris Sautter, a recount expert and adjunct lecturer at American University, said that in the Canova case, ""destroying ballots clearly violates federal law."" With respect to the Republican Party of Florida case, declaratory injunctions are a common remedy courts use to compel public officials to perform duties they are not performing, Sautter said. Nova Southeastern University law professor Bob Jarvis said that Singhal’s injunction was issued to prevent future violations. ""That’s what injunctions typically do – they prevent further law-breaking,"" he said. Other times in court, Snipes prevailed. In 2016, a Broward judge found no harm done to a handful of voters who initially received absentee ballots that omitted an amendment to legalize medical marijuana. Snipes offered replacement ballots to those voters. In April, a federal judge sided with Snipes in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Rights Union, a conservative group. The judge concluded that Snipes made reasonable efforts to purge ineligible voters from the rolls. Some other Broward elections problems didn’t result in litigation, such as when the county election website posted results about 30 minutes before the polls closed in the 2016 primary. VR Systems, a contractor for the elections supervisor, took responsibility. Broward prosecutors declined to file charges, finding essentially that it was a mistake. Snipes did not respond to a request for comment. Rubio said the Broward elections department ""has a history of violating the law."" Rubio’s tweet linked to a lawsuit in which a judge found Snipes prematurely unlawfully destroyed ballots. In the other case Rubio cited, the judge issued an injunction preventing Snipes from opening mail-in ballots before the canvassing board convened. It is worth mentioning, though, that Snipes has also won two cases in which she was sued: one related to a handful of ballots that omitted an amendment question and another which pertained to removing ineligible voters. We rate this statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/nov/12/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-broward-elections-office-has-hist/

Trump’s overly simplistic and false claim on California’s wildfires
","As deadly wildfires forced more than a quarter million Californians to flee their homes, President Trump recently alleged the infernos are the result of nothing more than poor ""forest management."" He also threatened to eliminate unspecified federal funds. The Camp fire in Northern California’s rural Butte County had killed 42 people and destroyed more than 6,400 homes as of Monday, making it the state’s most deadly and destructive fire in history. Authorities said more than 200 people remained unaccounted for. The fire started on Nov. 8, 2018 in a wooded area near the town of Paradise. Meanwhile, in Southern California, the Woolsey fire in Ventura and Los Angeles counties was blamed for the death of two people and had destroyed an estimated 435 structures. That blaze started on a suburban hillside, not a forest. In his first public comments about the fires, Trump tweeted on Nov. 10, 2018:   ""There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!""  He tweeted again on Nov. 11, 2018: ""With proper Forest Management, we can stop the devastation constantly going on in California. Get Smart!"" Trump’s comments drew sharp rebukes from firefighters and state officials, both for the threat to withhold funding during an emergency and for oversimplifying the reasons the fires are so destructive. In a tweet two days later, he thanked California’s firefighters and first responders. He also approved California's request for a major disaster declaration, freeing up federal aid for fire response and recovery. Given the strong reaction, we decided to fact-check the president’s contention ""there is no reason"" for California’s fires other than poor forest management. Our research Trump’s claim suggests the state government controls decisions over how and whether to thin forests, clear brush and set prescribed burns. In reality, California owns just 2 percent of forest land in the state, while the federal government owns upwards of 60 percent, said Keith Gilless, a UC Berkeley professor of forest economics and chairman of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection. The rest is owned by private landowners, timber companies and Native American tribes. Gilless said tree harvests have declined significantly on national forest lands over the past four decades due, at least in part, to legal challenges by environmentalists concerned about clear-cutting. The professor added that money spent in the past on preventing fires has been diverted to fighting them. The state has made significant investments in forest management, he said, but ""has no leverage"" over the federal government to do the same. In August, McClatchy reported the Trump administration ""proposed slashing tens of millions of dollars"" for tree clearing. Gilless added that Trump’s tweet ignores additional key factors driving California’s recent ""firestorms,"" such as winds reaching near 60 miles per hour and bone dry conditions. With those extremes, ""even good preparation can be overcome,"" he said. ""I think the biggest problem with the comments was the lack of nuance,"" Gilless said, describing them as ""uninformed."" ""It is a complex situation. Simple pronouncements on a subject like this are almost always in error."" Asked about Trump’s tweets in an interview on CNN, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Deputy Chief Scott McLean declined to respond directly, citing ""the lack of information given in that tweet."" He went on to describe California’s changing weather patterns. ""What’s been pushing all the fires these last couple years? The winds. The erratic wind behavior. The high temperatures early in the year that have dried out all this vegetation,"" McLean said. Fire and climate experts also say the trend of more people moving into wildland areas increases the chances of sparking forest fires. Jesse Miller, an ecologist who studies wildfires and lectures at Stanford University, described Trump’s comments as ""off base and not capturing the complexity of the situation."" ""Forest management might be part of the issue, but those are mostly federal lands up there (where the Camp fire started east of Chico). So, (Trump’s) actually in charge of most of those lands. … He’s also not recognizing the role of climate change. That’s by far what I and a lot of people think is the biggest factor driving these fires right now in California."" The White House did not respond to a request for evidence supporting Trump’s tweet. Our ruling President Trump claimed in a tweet ""there is no reason"" for California’s deadly fires other than poor ""forest management."" Forestry and climate experts say forest management, which includes thinning out forests, setting prescribed burns and clearing brush, is only one factor. But it’s not the only one, and not necessarily the driving force in the state’s recent firestorms. California’s stronger winds, higher temperatures and drier conditions driven by climate change are also making the fires worse. That’s in addition to the fact that more people now live in forested areas, increasing the chances of sparking an inferno. Trump erroneously places the blame on just one factor, while ignoring these other reasons for California’s devastating fires. We rate his oversimplified claim False.

U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin's claim that VA doctors 'are censored' from talking about pot misses plot
","Legalized marijuana is gaining momentum in Wisconsin and nationwide after the Nov. 6, 2018 election, but U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin says it remains off the menu for veterans. Baldwin, who was elected to a second term, has said she is frustrated that marijuana remains a Schedule 1 drug under federal law, a category for drugs that have ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse."" Baldwin said veterans groups have told her they want the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to be allowed to research the medical benefits of marijuana and they want VA doctors to be able to talk about it. ""(Doctors) are gagged right now, if that’s the right word,"" Baldwin said in a Sept. 14, 2018, interview on ""Devil’s Advocates,"" a Milwaukee-based liberal radio talk show. ""They’re muzzled, or censored, from being able to talk to their patients about the potential beneficial qualities if they were to use medicinal cannabis, and we’re trying to change that."" Marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. Does that mean VA doctors can’t even discuss the drug? Let’s check it out. Marijuana, veterans are key issues Veterans were a central issue in Baldwin’s race against Republican Leah Vukmir, who criticized Baldwin’s inaction after whistleblowers reported concerns at the Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center in 2014. Some veterans had dubbed the facility ""Candy Land,"" due to the widespread distribution of opioids, which led to the 2014 death of a former U.S. Marine. Baldwin disciplined top aides for the response to the whistleblowers and has since co-sponsored legislation to toughen opioid prescription guidelines and push education for VA providers. And marijuana has proven a winning issue in this election cycle. Michigan voters approved recreational marijuana on Tuesday, and Missouri and Utah legalized medical marijuana. North Dakota voters rejected what would have been the nation’s most permissive recreational use law. In Wisconsin, 16 counties and two cities had advisory referendums on marijuana-related questions. More than 70 percent of voters in Milwaukee and Dane counties said Wisconsin should legalize marijuana for recreational use, and in the city of Waukesha, 77 percent were in favor of legalizing marijuana for medical use. VA won’t dispense, recommend marijuana Marijuana straddles an awkward line between federal and state policy. It remains illegal per federal law, but 33 states have now approved medical marijuana, and 10 of those allow recreational use as well, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. And veterans are using marijuana for their ailments. A study based on a 2014 survey found about 9 percent of veterans in the U.S. reported using marijuana in the previous year — roughly the same as the general population. About 41 percent reported using it for medical reasons -- a rate more than double the national average. The VA says its health care providers are limited by federal law and can’t recommend, prescribe or help veterans obtain marijuana — regardless of what state the facility is in. An information sheet on the department’s website details those restrictions, noting the VA also will not pay for medical marijuana prescriptions or allow marijuana use or possession at a VA medical center. But the sheet says the topic is not forbidden. ""VA providers can and do discuss marijuana use with veterans as part of comprehensive care planning, and adjust treatment plans as necessary,"" the sheet says. ""Veterans are encouraged to discuss marijuana use with their VA providers."" It also notes veterans will not be denied VA benefits because of marijuana use and that providers will record marijuana use in the confidential medical record to have it available for treatment planning. A Baldwin spokesperson defended her claim, saying the bans have a chilling effect. ""There is a clear prohibition on recommending or prescribing medical marijuana in the VA policy, which suppresses the ability of doctors to talk to veterans about all of their potential treatment options,"" said Kasey Hampton, Baldwin’s spokeswoman. Our rating Baldwin said VA doctors ""are censored"" from talking to patients about the benefits of marijuana. But the evidence her office cites relates only to VA bans on recommending or prescribing the drug. And VA guidelines explicitly encourage veterans to discuss marijuana use with providers. There’s an element of truth to Baldwin’s claim — since those discussions are presumably limited by the restrictions the VA imposes — but there is no evidence of censorship. That’s our definition of Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2018/nov/09/tammy-baldwin/us-sen-tammy-baldwins-claim-va-doctors-are-censore/

Stewart claims that the stimulus bill is one-third tax cuts
","Fox News host Bill O'Reilly and Daily Show host Jon Stewart traded wisecracks -- and a few insults -- in O'Reilly's No Spin Zone on Feb. 3, 2010.

O'Reilly told Stewart that it was frightening that the Daily Show host had been called ""an important cultural arbiter."" O'Reilly said that his audience is ""primarily stoner slackers who love Obama,"" but that ""a lot of people don't think you're smart.""

Stewart shot back that O'Reilly was now the ""voice of sanity"" at Fox, which he likened to ""being the thinnest kid at fat camp.""

At times, they got serious. One topic was Stewart's belief that Republicans seem intent on opposing everything President Barack Obama puts on the table -- even if he presents an opportunity to compromise.

""But the president won't give the GOP anything,"" O'Reilly said.

Stewart pointed to Obama's stimulus plan as an example. The bill was opposed by Republicans even though it included tax cuts, which typically appeal to their small government sensibilities.

""[Obama] has given [Republicans] many different angles,"" Stewart said. ""For instance, even in the stimulus plan, a full third of that was tax cuts. ... Just like at the State of the Union when he said we cut taxes for 95 percent of middle-class Americans, and everybody clapped, and the Republicans just sat there like this. Tax cuts, that sounds vaguely familiar."" Is Stewart right that tax cuts account for a third of the stimulus plan? The stimulus bill, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is meant to create jobs and boost the economy. It cost $787 billion, including $499 billion to fund new roads, hire teachers and generally keep people employed, and about $288 billion in tax breaks to individuals and businesses. Among other things, the mix of tax cuts includes a refundable credit of up to $400 per individual and $800 for married couples; a temporary increase of the earned income tax credit for disadvantaged families; and an extension of a program that allows businesses to recover the costs of capital expenditures faster than usual.

Simple math shows that Stewart is in the ballpark with his claim: $288 billion is a little more than 36 percent of the bill's overall cost. So, tax cuts -- at least the way they've been defined by the Obama administration -- make up for slightly more than one-third of the bill.

But calculating the cost of the true tax cuts in the stimulus is a bit more complicated. In July 2009, we checked Obama's claim that, at the time, the stimulus had delivered $43 billion in tax breaks. According to the Treasury Department, about $8 billion of that figure came from extending a fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Originally, the AMT was targeted at very wealthy people, but over the years it spread to include some middle-income taxpayers as well. Congress passes yearly fixes to prevent those middle income taxpayers from having to pay the AMT.

All told, the AMT fix in the stimulus will cost about $70 billion over 10 years, according to a bill summary published by the Senate Finance Committee. But many tax experts say the AMT fix should not be considered a tax cut. They say that, by extending the AMT fix every year, the government is basically maintaining the status quo.

Back in July, we spoke with a number of tax experts about the issue who all agreed that including the fix as part of the stimulus ""tax cuts"" is a stretch.

Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the free-market Cato Institute, explained it this way:

""AMT is something those people never expect to pay,"" he said. ""It's kind of like saying that, if I didn't rob you on the way home from work today, I gave you money.""

The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, gave the AMT extension a D-minus in its Tax Stimulus Report Card because ""the provision would provide virtually no economic stimulus. Because the patch is perennially extended, it would have no effect on behavior in 2009. Almost 80 percent of the benefits would go to the richest 20 percent of households, who would be least likely to spend the additional funds and stimulate demand.""

So, our tax experts are skeptical that the $70 billion AMT fix should be included in the stimulus bill's tax relief. That would bring down the cost of the tax cuts to about $218 billion. That means about 28 percent of the bill could be described as tax cuts, a little less than the one-third cited by Stewart.

So we find Stewart's claim to be Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/10/jon-stewart/stewart-claims-stimulus-bill-one-third-tax-cuts/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Stimulus', 'Nancy Pelosi']","
Pelosi touts Democrats' revival of 'pay-as-you-go' budget rules
","In recent months, the two parties have sparred over federal spending, with Republicans charging that Democrats have spent taxpayer dollars too freely and Democrats countering that they've made efforts to curb the nation's rising deficits. One of the Democrats' main arguments about their record of fiscal responsibility is their advocacy of ""pay-as-you-go"" (or ""PAYGO"") policies. These policies have existed in several different forms over the years, but the general principle that binds them all together is that they require new spending to be paid for by making sure that the new costs are balanced by spending cuts, revenue increases or a combination of the two. President Barack Obama has often praised PAYGO, though PolitiFact ruled that his April 2009 claim that PAYGO ""helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s"" was an exaggeration and Half True. More recently, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made a point of praising PAYGO. Her comments, in a Feb. 4, 2010, press conference, came on the heels of House passage of a bill that did two things -- it raised the limit on how far into debt the United States can go, and it established a PAYGO law. Pelosi said, ""When I became speaker of the House ... our majority made PAYGO the rule of the House -- that if you wanted to have an investment, an entitlement, etc., you had to pay for it. There was no open-ended spending."" We decided to see whether Pelosi was accurately describing what her majority did. The PAYGO that Pelosi's comment refers to -- the one instituted in 2007 -- was a House rule that governs how bills are taken up in the House. (This rule is distinct from the law that is expected to be signed by the president, although the two are broadly similar, differing mainly in operational details.) The rule approved in 2007 -- and still in force -- effectively bars the House from taking up a bill if it would, on balance, increase projected deficits. So, a bill that cut taxes by $10 billion would need to be offset by a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases that equaled $10 billion. Similarly, a bill that added $10 billion in spending would have to be offset by cuts elsewhere or tax increases totaling $10 billion. A bill does not have to be ""deficit neutral"" in every year; rather, it has to be deficit-neutral over a defined ""budget window"" going forward. The rule states that if any House member believes that a bill or an amendment being brought to the floor violates PAYGO, that lawmaker can raise an objection. If the presiding officer determines that the bill does indeed violate PAYGO, it effectively kills the bill. However, as a practical matter, it rarely happens that way. Either a bill brought up for consideration will comply with PAYGO, or else it will be in violation of PAYGO but with the majority leadership's support for waiving the PAYGO requirement. Most commonly, the leadership will push a waiver through the House Rules Committee, which historically is an instrument of the leadership. The Rules Committee would write a rule that effectively overrides PAYGO for the bill in question. Once the committee passes that rule -- which is almost a certainty -- the majority party only needs to corral a simple majority of the chamber to pass it, which in turn paves the way for passage of the PAYGO-waived bill itself. Those who say the benefits of PAYGO have been oversold have focused on two concerns. The first is that the PAYGO rule doesn't touch a number of important types of federal spending. And the second is that House Democrats have been too quick to waive PAYGO. On the first point, several types of spending are exempt from PAYGO. A big one is discretionary spending, which includes everything from defense and homeland security to education, housing and transportation. ""Congress could triple the discretionary budget tomorrow without triggering PAYGO,"" writes Brian Riedl, a budget scholar with the Heritage Foundation. ""That's quite a loophole."" While spending on these programs is supposed to be controlled by annual targets set in congressional budget plans, PAYGO itself has no effect on them. So, to the extent that ""an investment,"" to use Pelosi's words, is undertaken using discretionary spending, it's not affected by PAYGO. That's one misleading part of her statement. Meanwhile, any spending increases currently scheduled under the law are also exempt. That means that even as the costs of programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid grow, policymakers are not required to make changes to finance these costs. PAYGO kicks in only if lawmakers seek to create a new entitlement, or to expand or increase existing entitlement benefits beyond what the current formula says. ""Total entitlement spending can continue growing 6 percent annually without triggering PAYGO,"" Riedl writes. ""Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid can continue down their path to swallow up the entire federal budget."" The new law now awaiting the president's signature would implement additional exemptions from PAYGO, some permanent, some temporary. According to the newsletter CongressDaily, the measure includes ""an unlimited exemption for extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for the middle class,"" plus two-year exemptions for updates to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and reductions to estate taxes, as well as a five-year exemption for bills that delay Medicare reimbursement cuts for physicians. The critics' second complaint concerns the waiver process. Even on bills for which PAYGO would be in effect, they say, the House Democratic majority has been willing to use waivers to sidestep their own rule. ""Congress waived PAYGO every time it proved even slightly inconvenient,"" Riedl writes. ""The lawmakers waived it to extend unemployment benefits. They waived it to create a $63 billion veterans' entitlement. They waived it for the $787 billion 'stimulus' bill. [Pelosi] suggested that PAYGO be waived for any bill she feels will help the economy. Even when PAYGO wasn't waived, Congress resorted to gimmicks for compliance."" Nadeam Elshami, a spokesman for Pelosi, defends the Democratic record on PAYGO. He said that PAYGO waivers have only been used on ""emergencies"" -- such as the stimulus -- and for ""the extension of current policies,"" such as the AMT update and the Medicare reimbursement increase. In the case of the AMT, Elshami added, the House initially passed a version that complied with PAYGO but could not convince the Senate to go along.  In addition, Elshami said, ""viewing PAYGO's efficacy by only looking at the exceptions doesn’t present a complete picture of how the House has dealt with its rules regarding PAYGO. Many of the major acts under Democrats were PAYGO-compliant."" He specifically cited the House version of the health care reform bill, the farm bill and the expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program.  Elshami also fired back at the Republicans' record on the deficit, noting that party leaders essentially waived PAYGO when they passed the 2001 and 2003 rounds of tax cuts and that they created the Medicare drug benefit in 2003 after the prior incarnation of PAYGO had lapsed -- bills that added hundreds of billions of dollars to the federal deficit. Outside experts agree that PAYGO has had some impact. ""I think it has changed the culture,"" said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a centrist think tank. ""I do see a lot of bills proposed with offsets. The rule has caused Congress to think more carefully about the costs of what they pass."" Still, Goldwein said that critics have a fair point that the Democratic majority has been quick to waive PAYGO when it faced tough choices. ""It sounds like what Speaker Pelosi said was technically true, that they instituted PAYGO, but what is implied is false -- that they paid for all their new spending and tax cuts,"" Goldwein said. So let's look back at Pelosi's statement. It's an undeniable fact that the new Democratic majority in 2007 ""made PAYGO the rule of the House,"" as she said. But the second part of her statement -- ""if you wanted to have an investment, an entitlement, etc., you had to pay for it"" -- contains some aspects that are misleading. Investments made with discretionary spending, from highway-building to elementary school aid, were never supposed to be subject to PAYGO. Nor were ordinary increases in entitlements. In addition, even for key bills that should have been subject to PAYGO, Democratic leaders have acted to waive the rule on several occasions. So we rate Pelosi's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/10/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-touts-democrats-revival-pay-you-go-budget-r/

Rick Perry says Sen. Hutchison took 154 private plane trips funded by U.S. taxpayers when commercial flights were available
","
Gov. Rick Perry’s high-flying campaign — he’s led Republican foes in pre-primary polls — posted a catchy video online last week depicting challenger Kay Bailey Hutchison, the state’s senior U.S. senator, as a profligate jet-setter.

The nearly two-minute ad floats both a broad charge and one suggesting she’s beholden to special interests.

The big charge: Hutchison has taken 154 trips on private jets, many between airports offering commercial flights at a fraction of the cost. The second hit: Her flights include trips on jets provided by lobbyists, donors and corporations with business before Hutchison in Washington.

Perry’s spot, titled ""Wanna Get Away?,"" is a play on commercials for Southwest Airlines. Fergie, lead singer of the Black Eyed Peas, sings ""Glamorous"" as images of a smiling Hutchison flit past, including the senator standing next to Lance Armstrong on an airport tarmac near a jet.

Fergie's lush performance neatly reinforces the ad's imagery. Still, we wondered if Perry accurately characterized Hutchison’s flightiness.

His campaign shared with us their original sources, which were reports covering every senator's expenses compiled by the Secretary of the U.S. Senate. Most of Hutchison's private-plane flights are identified in the reports with the name of the plane provider, though about 20 didn't show how the senator made her trip; Perry's campaign said it assumed she took private planes because she reported visits to several cities in a day not connected by commercial flights.

Hutchison’s campaign spotted a couple of erroneous dates in Perry's charts of Hutchison flights, but didn't quiible with the overall tabulation of 154 Hutchison flights on private planes from July 1994, about a year after Hutchison joined the Senate, into June 2009, or with Perry’s claim that the itemized trips were reimbursed with $518,892.39 in federal funds.

Hutchison spokeswoman Jennifer Baker stressed that using private planes is a common permitted practice in the Senate. ""There’s not anything wrong with it,"" Baker said.

Baker said senators are permitted to use private jets for official business and seek federal reimbursement for the cost of the charter. Before 2007, members could use federal money to reimburse providers of private plane trips only as much as the cost of a first-class plane ticket or the highest commercial fare.

""It is the policy of Sen. Hutchison’s office to use the most cost-effective means of transportation that allows her to fulfill her official obligations,"" Baker said. ""Part of her effectiveness as Texas’ senior senator is a result of her work ethic, which requires early-morning travel, late-night travel and stops in numerous cities in one day. Commercial travel is not always an option.""

Baker also pointed out that photos in the ad of Hutchison next to the jet with Armstrong and inside a jet, seated in an aisle seat, leave a mistaken impression. They both were taken by news organizations last year when Hutchison chartered the jet to kick off her gubernatorial campaign. Contrary to the gist of Perry's ad, that travel was funded by Hutchison's campaign, not taxpayers. (According to campaign finance filings, Hutchison spent nearly $176,000 in campaign funds on chartered jets while stumping for governor from July through December.)

Did Hutchison routinely lean on special interests to provide planes for her travel, as Perry's ad implies? Doesn't look like it.

From 2000 through 2009, Perry's campaign found, 15 trips were provided by campaign donors, lobbyists or corporations at a reimbursed cost of $12,461.

Let's put that in perspective: The 15 flights amounted to 10 percent of Hutchison’s 154 reimbursed private flights since 1994 or 2.4 percent of her total reimbursements for private flights.

Perry's campaign didn't offer evidence that any private flight was linked to a Hutchison vote or deal, though a Perry spokesman said the corporations that provided jets — businesses including giants like Clear Channel and TXU Corp., the utility company that became Energy Future Holdings—""constantly have business before her committees."" The senator is the highest-ranking Republican on the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. She’s also on the Senate’s panels for appropriations; banking, housing and urban affairs; and rules and administration.

Three individuals provided private planes for Hutchison: attorney Tom Luce and developer Mike A. Myers, both of Dallas, and San Antonio lawyer and former U.S. Rep. Tom Loeffler. Loeffler is a registered federal lobbyist, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Perry’s campaign reminded us, correctly, that Hutchison also has received campaign donations from leaders of the plane-providing interests.

Next, we tried to pin whether Hutchison took private flights when commercial alternatives were readily available, as Perry’s ad says.

Baker, of Hutchison’s campaign, said the senator chooses private flights only when commercial flights don't match up with her busy schedule. ""Oftentimes, her schedule is such that chartered travel is the only means to allow her to fulfill her duties,"" Baker said. ""In a large state like Texas, you have a finite amount of time in the state. You have to maximize that time.""

We asked about an Oct. 3, 2008, jet trip highlighted in Perry’s ad, which claims the same round trip between Dallas and Austin would have cost $306 on Southwest Airlines. We weren't able to verify that fare, though the current roundtrip Southwest fare would run from as little as $98 if flights were booked well in advance to $320 if arranged at the last minute.

Baker said Hutchison took a charter, costing $5,523, because she didn’t complete an evening speaking engagement near Austin for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Foundation until 8:45 p.m. Asked if Hutchison could have stayed overnight in Austin, returning to Dallas on a commercial flight the next day, Baker said she didn’t know what the senator had scheduled that next morning.

Another private plane trip noted in Perry’s ad—roundtrip between Dallas and Houston on Sept. 14, 2008, at a cost of $5,732 — could have cost $302 on Southwest Airlines, according to Perry’s campaign. Baker said Hutchison and her aide couldn’t fly commercial that day because she toured hurricane damage in Galveston until after 8:30 p.m., too late to catch a commercial flight back to Dallas.

At our request, Juan Portillo, president of an Austin-based travel management firm, Tramex Travel, looked over the Perry campaign's summary of Hutchison’s 154 private plane trips. Portillo concluded that many of them could not have been efficiently planned employing commercial airline flights partly because there are no direct flights connecting cities like Harlingen and Waco, to name one Hutchison trip, or Victoria and Corpus Christi and Lufkin, which was another.

""No way you can do it"" in a day without using chartered planes, Portillo said.

The upshot: Perry accurately identified 154 taxpayer-funded private plane trips taken by Hutchison during 16 years of her Senate service, including 15 planes provided by donors, corporations and one identified lobbyist from 2000 through 2009.

That single lobbyist does not support the ad's three references to ""lobbyists."" And Perry's claim that Hutchison could instead have taken readily available commercial flights for her trips is questionable.

We rate Perry's ad as Half True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/10/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-sen-hutchison-took-154-private-pla/

Palin claims Biden held a transparency board meeting behind closed doors
","Attendees of the recent Tea Party Convention gave a rousing reception to Sarah Palin -- especially when she talked about transparency surrounding President Barack Obama's $787 billion stimulus package. ""Our administration promised that it would be good stewards of taxpayer dollars,"" Palin said on Feb. 6, 2010, in Nashville. Palin noted that the administration had promised openness and transparency, but said that Vice President Joe Biden recently met with the stimulus transparency board behind closed doors. ""I tried to look into that transparency thing, but Joe's meetings with the transparency and accountability board? It was closed to the public. Yup, they held a transparency meeting behind closed doors,"" she said. There's something ironic about a transparency meeting being held in private, so we wondered whether Palin was correct. Generally speaking, private meetings among top officials are not unusual in Washington. That's how business is often conducted in the executive and legislative branches. In those cases, no reporters are allowed. In a few cases, one or two reporters are allowed into the room to compile what's called a ""pool report"" in journalism parlance. These blow-by-blow summaries are then circulated among the press corps. Meg Stapleton, Palin's spokeswoman, told us the former Alaska governor was referring to a Jan. 14, 2010, meeting between Biden and Earl Devaney, chairman of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. It is an oversight committee that was created by the economic stimulus bill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The board is supposed to provide transparency on how stimulus funds are used, and prevent fraud and mismanagement. Stapleton pointed us to a post on the Los Angeles Times Web site by blogger Andrew Malcolm, who noted that a meeting about transparency was closed to the press. ""Unfortunately, the transparency meeting is nontransparent, closed to the press. ... Which makes it -- what? -- secret openness? Open secrecy?"" Malcolm wrote. We checked Biden's schedule for the day, and indeed, he met with Devaney at 2:15 p.m. Jan. 14. The meeting was closed to the press: no transcript, no pool report. But it was not, as Palin indicated, a meeting with the full board. It was listed as a one-on-one meeting with Devaney.White House spokeswoman Liz Oxhorn said it was a meeting between Biden and Devaney to discuss measures Devaney is taking to prevent fraud. The spokeswoman said those meetings are typically closed because of the sensitive nature of the discussions. We found two other sessions where Biden and Devaney had been involved in public meetings together. In February 2009, the two attended an open meeting at the White House to talk stimulus bill implementation. In March, they held a conference with governors to discuss stimulus projects. A pool report from June 2009 described a meeting between Biden, Devaney and members of Obama's Cabinet regarding stimulus funding. Technically speaking, Biden is not a member of the transparency and accountability board, which, besides Devaney, consists of 12 inspectors general from various federal agencies. Minutes from the group's meetings indicate Biden has not attended any of its meetings.The group is required to meet at least six times every year, but has met a total of 18 times since March 2009, according to the Recovery.gov Web site. The White House did not respond to our inquires about whether the board meets in public or not. Nor did we find newspaper stories or press releases on the Recovery.gov Web site that indicate that these are open meetings. So, from what we can tell, these gatherings have been private, usually at an office building just a few blocks from the White House, though minutes from those meetings, as well as reports, testimony and financial activity reports are made public.But Palin's claim was strictly about that one meeting between Biden and Devaney. She is correct that Biden and Devaney met privately on Jan. 14. But she incorrectly said it was a meeting of the transparency and accountability board when it was just a meeting of the vice president and the chairman.

Farouk Shami says Houston No. 3 in toxicity in the nation
","
Houston businessman Farouk Shami, running for governor, turned to his leading Democratic foe on Monday night and leveled a foul charge.

In a televised debate, Shami told Bill White, the former Houston mayor: ""Our city is the third-most toxic city in the United States of America.""

White didn’t take issue with Shami’s description, but it was news to us. We decided to check into the Bayou City’s ""ick"" ranking.

Shami’s campaign said the candidate based his statement on a 2009 article in Forbes magazine putting Houston behind only Atlanta and Detroit for toxicity among major U.S. cities.

The magazine said it based its rankings of the nation’s 40 largest metropolitan statistical areas on data provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

""We counted the number of facilities that reported releasing toxins into the environment,"" the magazine said, ""the total pounds of certain toxic chemicals released into the air, water and earth, the days per year that air pollution was above healthy levels, and the number of times the EPA has responded to reports of a potentially hazardous environmental incident or site in each metro area's principal city.""

Its article states Houston's residents live with with air that's far filthier than it should be.

""Facilities in Houston released 88.7 million pounds of toxic chemicals in the environment in 2007,"" the magazine says, ""and the former site of a methanol fire and chemical explosion number among the city's 50 sites necessitating an EPA response. Factories that serve the local petrochemical industry emit benzene and 1-3 butabeine, toxins proven to be particularly harmful, that the area's intense sunlight and lack of wind keep trapped in the local area's atmosphere.""

Jim Lester, vice president of the Houston Advanced Research Center, a Woodlands-based nonprofit group that studies and promotes sustainable development, is quoted saying Houston has become ""one of the favorite places in the world for doing air-quality science."" He saw that as a boon: ""The more people understand about it (air quality), the more changes are likely that will take us in a positive direction.""

When we reached Lester, he revisited pollution levels reported by industries and posted online by the EPA. In 2007, Harris County industries reported either releasing or disposing of 36.1 million pounds of toxic chemicals, while industries around Detroit in Wayne County nearly matched that dubious achievement, reporting the disposal or release of nearly 30 million pounds of toxic pollutants.

Shami correctly referred to a recent national comparison. We rate his statement as True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/09/farouk-shami/farouk-shami-says-houston-no-3-toxicity-nation/

Palin claims a state paid $1 million to advertise that they were spending stimulus money
","In her keynote speech at the Tea Party Convention on Feb. 6, 2010, Sarah Palin mocked some of the spending in the massive economic stimulus championed by President Barack Obama.""One state even spent a million bucks to put up signs that advertise that they were spending on the federal stimulus projects,"" Palin said. ""Or as someone put it, this was a million-dollar effort using your money to tell you it's spending your money. And it didn't create a single job.""Many stimulus projects are simply wasteful, she said.""And in the case of those signs,"" she said, ""kind of ridiculous.""The state in question here is clearly Ohio, which has been the subject of recent press reports on the subject. And the issue is over road signs along stimulus-funded highway projects that state: ""Putting America to Work. Project Funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.""The stimulus' implementation guidelines from the Federal Highway Administration ""strongly encourages"" (but does not require) the signs ""to make it easier for Americans to see which projects are funded by the ARRA."" The guidelines also provide precise details on the form and content of the sign and recovery logo. As far back as July, a number of Republican legislators, and some Democrats, criticized the signs as wasteful. Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin, mocking the red, blue and green logo of the stimulus, went so far as to label the signs “stimulus hype propaganda sporting the mark of the porkulus beast."" As a result of the public pressure, a number of states balked at the federal recommendation to erect stimulus signs. Ohio was not one of them.The signs became something of a pet peeve of Republican Ohio state Sen. Tim Grendell, who drove daily past stimulus signs on both sides of a highway resurfacing project near his home. Grendell's complaints were aired in the Cleveland Plain Dealer on Sept. 9, 2009, along with the paper's estimate that the signs could cost up to $1 million in Ohio. But a more recent Jan. 26, 2010, report on CNN may also have caught Palin's attention. CNN also cited the $1 million price tag and attributed the figure to Grendell.So we called Grendell. He called the signs ""self-congratulatory spin for the federal government and the Obama administration"" and said the money could be better spent on many other worthy highway projects in Ohio. ""It's a total waste of public dollars,"" he said.As for the $1 million figure, Grendell said he got that estimate from an Ohio Department of Transportation official when he called to complain about the signs.Since then, Grendell said he spoke to a company that rents some of the signs, and that they go for as much as $3,000 apiece. And with one on each side of a road project, that can run $6,000 per project.Scott Varner, a spokesman with the Ohio Department of Transportation, called the $1 million figure ""inaccurate,"" although he said the state has no way of knowing the precise figure. The cost is rolled into the expense of all the construction signs in a construction zone, he said.The $1 million estimate, he said, is based on a ""high-end"" estimate of the cost of a sign ($2,000 to $3,000 apiece), multiplied by the number of projects. The cost of signs varies from project to project, he said, but the ODOT estimated the cost of a large sign at about $1,000 to $1,300 per sign (with the bulk of the cost in labor for installation and removal). In July, the Associated Press reported that Michigan estimated a sign costs $400 to $500. Illinois officials suggested $300 for the sign and an additional $700 when labor is included, while Colorado officials said materials plus labor would run between $750 and $1,200 per sign.The $1 million estimate in Ohio also assumes two signs per project, Varner said, and the reality is that many projects only got one sign; and many didn't get one at all. The estimate is also based on the cost of a large sign for interstate projects. Smaller, less expensive signs are used for city projects, he said.""That $1 million figure is at best on the high end,"" Varner said. ""It's not a true number."" It is more likely ""significantly under that.""The complaints by Grendell, and more recently Palin, also ignore the value of the signs, Varner said. Ohio placed a high priority on transparency and accountability with regard to stimulus projects, he said.""What better way to let people know where the stimulus dollars are being spent,"" he said.CNN polled other states and found at least 16 that are skipping the signs and putting the money toward road projects instead.One of the states that has opted against the signs is Vermont. In a blog posting, the state's chief recovery officer, Tom Evslin, said, ""Here in Vermont we decided that we'd rather spend the stimulus highway dollars on roads than signs."" All of the state's stimulus projects are listed on a state Web site, he said. ""The Web is cheaper than signs.""We think it's accurate for Palin to describe the signs as advertisements for spending on stimulus projects. That's exactly the point of them. We'll leave it up to legislators and the American public to decide whether that's an appropriate use of stimulus funds. But we can say the $1 million figure for signs in Ohio is suspect and appears to be a back-of-the-envelope estimate, rather than a hard fact. Ohio transportation officials said the total for signs is likely significantly lower than that. But neither Palin nor ODOT (nor anyone else for that matter) can cite an exact figure.

Palin says Obama voted ""present"" in U.S. Senate ""quite often""
","In an interview with FoxNews.com at the National Tea Party Convention on Feb. 6, 2010, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin reprised a Republican talking point from the 2008 presidential campaign by criticizing President Barack Obama for his lack of executive experience.Asked by FoxNews.com's Judd Berger whether she thought she's ""more qualified to be president than President Obama,"" Palin referred to the debate over ""experience"" from the 2008 contest between Obama and her running mate, Arizona Sen. John McCain:""The whole qualification issue still perplexes me, because in the campaign we tried to bring attention to the fact that Obama had really not a lot of experience. And I do say that my executive experience, as an administrator, as a team manager if you will was, and so was John McCain's as a matter of fact, was stronger and we had more experience than Barack Obama did in terms of managing huge multibillion dollar budgets and thousands of employees that I had just come from a position of that and that hasn't changed.""When Berger asked Palin, ""But without McCain?"" -- a long-serving Arizona senator -- Palin responded:""And without McCain, I mean Barack Obama had 150 days in the U.S. Senate where he was able to vote quite often present, not have to make decisions, being one of many, not having to manage. His executive position now in the White House is as, whether he likes it or not, a manager. He has to make tough decisions. He has to be willing to fire people, though you don't make any friends when you fire people, and I know that first-hand because I've had to do that. And you have to make tough decisions, and not dither on issues. You have to make quick decisions in many respects, and I think that President Obama, with all due respect, his lack of experience is really made manifest in the way that decisions are made in the White House today.""Palin's answer offers a lot to chew on, but we'll leave aside the larger question of whether she's more qualified to be president than the incumbent. Instead, we'll stick to the narrower claim that Obama often voted ""present"" in the U.S. Senate.We should point out that Palin's phrasing in this sentence is a bit unclear. Does she mean that Obama spent only 150 days in the U.S. Senate -- an argument that dovetails not just with the 2008 argument that Obama was young and inexperienced but with the (accurate) argument that he missed a lot of votes while running for president?If that's what she meant, she is incorrect. There are no statistics on day-by-day attendance for senators, but we approximated the bare minimum number of days that Obama was in the chamber by counting the number of days that he cast a vote. (In the Senate, votes cannot be cast remotely.) While it's true that Obama's absentee rate skyrocketed in the third and fourth years of his term, when he was running for president, we found that he cast votes on more than 180 separate days in 2005 and 2006, combined. And that undercounts his total days on the job, because the Senate does not necessarily vote every day that it's in session, and because we didn't count the (admittedly smaller) number of voting days he was present in 2007 and 2008.So, what about Palin's claim that Obama had 150 ""present"" votes in the U.S. Senate? The claim harkens back to the (again, accurate) charge that Obama frequently voted ""present"" when he was a state senator in Illinois. (It was actually a Democrat -- Hillary Rodham Clinton -- who gave this claim high-profile attention during the primaries.)Obama acknowledged voting ""present"" -- a vote similar in its effect to ""abstain"" -- 129 times during his eight-year state Senate tenure, according to a Boston Globe fact-check at the time. The Globe said that Obama cast about 4,000 votes as an Illinois legislator, meaning that he voted ""present"" in about one of every 31 votes he took. The New York Times reported that the records show at least 36 occasions in which Obama was either the only state senator to vote present or was part of a group of six or fewer to vote that way.Some of his ""present"" votes came on contentious issues -- abortion, juvenile justice and gun laws among them -- and critics have suggested that Obama's decision to avoid a ""yes"" or a ""no"" vote in those cases stemmed from political expediency. Other analysts have cited a more benign reason, saying that voting ""present"" has long been used as a way of expressing protest about the way a bill was put together, or displeasure about a specific provision contained within a bill.""You get a lot of 'present' votes from minority members to avoid the traps set by the majority,"" said University of Illinois at Springfield political scientist Kent Redfield. ""Obama was in the minority most of the time he was in the legislature, and his present votes are slightly below the average for a member of his caucus.""But this discussion of ""present"" votes has to do with the Illinois legislature. It has nothing to do with the U.S. Senate.We checked all of Obama's votes in the U.S. Senate and found not a single ""present"" vote. That's not surprising, given the way Senate procedure works.""It’s very rare for a senator to vote 'present,' "" said U.S. Senate historian Donald A. Ritchie. ""That’s usually only if they are somehow personally involved in something."" Palin's statement is incorrect in two ways. She initially appears to suggest that Obama had only 150 days of experience in the U.S. Senate, which is inaccurate. She then says he voted present many times, which also is not correct. He never voted present in the U.S. Senate. So we find her statement False.",/factchecks/2010/feb/08/sarah-palin/palin-says-obama-voted-present-us-senate-very-ofte/

Medina says executive spending went up 13.5% in quarter
","
For the next governor of Texas, one task will overshadow all the others on the to-do list: closing a state budget shortfall that some projections put as high as $15 billion.

During the second Republican gubernatorial debate Jan. 29, candidates were asked to detail what programs they would cut or taxes they would raise to balance the budget. Debra Medina, who is in the three-way race for the GOP nomination with Gov. Rick Perry and U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, took the opportunity to criticize the incumbent’s fiscal record.

""You know, it’s unfortunate that the governor’s not taking his own fiscal advice,"" Medina said. ""The 'Fiscal Notes' just released by the (state) comptroller last week shows in the executive department in the first fiscal quarter of this year, we’ve seen a 13.5 percent increase in spending, double-digit spending out of the executive branch in the state of Texas, when everyone here has been tightening their belts for a year.""

Has Perry become a heavy-spending governor? We wondered whether Medina's statement was on the money.

The ""Fiscal Notes"" that Medina cited is a newsletter produced by the state comptroller’s office. For the first quarter of fiscal 2010 — that’s September through November 2009 — it reported that expenditures went up 13.5 percent for the ""executive"" segment of general government compared with spending by that segment in the same quarter the previous year.

But what falls under the ""executive"" category?

We put that question to the state comptroller’s office, which answered with a list of 25 agencies categorized as executive and administrative.

That's not to say that the governor is directly responsible for all of those. In Texas, executive powers are spread among elected officials, including the governor, the attorney general and the comptroller. At least five agencies on the list are the responsibility of either the attorney general’s office or the comptroller’s office.

Most of the other so-called executive agencies are commissions, offices or departments led by administrators appointed by the governor or whose governing boards include gubernatorial appointees.

The governor's office is directly responsible for only three line items on the comptroller's list, including the Office of State-Federal Relations.

Now, let’s look at the money. The 13.5 percent jump in spending that Medina referenced reflects a $196.5 million net increase for all the agencies. (The ""net"" part is important because some of the agencies saw their expeditures decline in the first quarter.)

By far the largest spending jump ($87.3 million) occurred in the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, whose board is made up of gubernatorial appointees.

However, almost all those dollars came from the federal government, not the state. They were spent on recovery costs related to Hurricane Rita, which hit in 2005; on utility payments for low-income people; and on a homelessness prevention program and other initiatives that were part of the federal stimulus package approved by Congress last year.

The attorney general’s office is No. 2 on the published spending list. Most of its $36 million increase — about $32 million — was attributable to higher collections of child-support payments.

The comptroller’s office also accounts for a significant chunk of the spending increase, about $36.8 million.

All told, these free-standing agencies — Housing and Community Affairs, the attorney general’s office and the comptroller’s office — account for about 80 percent of the net increase in first-quarter expenditures cited by Medina.

So where does spending controlled by the governor fit in?

Of the three entities on the list that are directly tied to his office, two spent less during the first quarter compared to the year before.  

The third line item, ""Governor -- Fiscal,"" showed a $15 million net increase in the quarter. According to Perry’s office, a small portion, about $800,000, was federal stimulus money.

The biggest expenditure of state funds, $10 million, consisted of disaster relief related to hurricane damage. The rest went to the governor’s economic development initiatives, the Emerging Technology Fund and the Texas Enterprise Fund, as well as incentives to attract film projects.

Summing up: The governor's office was directly responsible for about $14 million in increased state spending, or 7 percent of the $196 million spending increase that caught Medina's attention.

One caution: Virtually every agency official and government watcher we spoke with warned against drawing conclusions about spending or budget trends by solely looking at one quarter of activity, partly because spending can fluctuate based on when various grants and loans are passed through.

Finally: Medina is correct that overall spending by agencies in the executive portion of state government went up 13.5 percent in the first quarter.

But placing the responsibility at Perry’s feet isn't justified. The largest chunk of the spent money came from the federal government, and the bulk of the remaining ""executive branch"" expenditures took place in agencies run by other elected officials.

We rate Medina's statement as Half True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/08/debra-medina/Me/

""I seriously doubt that Floridians will want to undo what they approved in 2002. I strongly support giving school districts the flexibility they need to deal with small increases in the student-teacher ratios. But it is important to remember that Florida still averages more students in its classrooms than any other state in the Southeast."" We wondered if Sands' claim, that Florida averages more students per classrooms than other states in the Southeast, is right. First, some background. In November 2002, Florida voters passed a constitutional amendment that sets limits for how many students are allowed per class starting in the 2010-11 school year. The limits are subdivided by grades K-3, 4-8 and 9-12: no more than 18 students for grades K-3, no more than 22 students for grades 4-8 and no more than 25 students for grades 9-12. In 2003, the state started to slowly implement the changes. First, classroom reductions were measured at the school district average, then at the school average. In the fall, districts are scheduled to meet the new limits in every classroom. But Crist and some prominent state legislators have suggested freezing the class-size reduction program at the school average rather than investing more money. (The state Department of Education says reducing class sizes further would cost an additional $3.2 billion.) A recent state report suggests almost 235,000 classrooms in 2,769 schools across Florida would fall short if the amendment were fully implemented in the fall. In contrast, only a small percentage of schools have not met the requirements of a schoolwide average. Districts face possible financial penalties in the millions if they fall short. Back to Sands' claim. His office pointed us to the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the U.S. Department of Education, which is considered a primary source on education statistics and research. States submit annual data to NCES, which then calculates enrollment and teacher statistics. The most recent data available is from the 2007-08 school year, said Patrick Keaton, a researcher with the group. Data from the 2008-09 school year is due out this spring, he said. Using teacher and enrollment data, NCES calculates a pupil/teacher ratio. Florida, in 2007-2008, had 15.8 students for every classroom teacher, the NCES reported. That is more than Alabama (14.8), Arkansas (14.1), Georgia (14.1), Kentucky (15.3), Louisiana (14), Mississippi (14.7), North Carolina (14), South Carolina (15), and Tennessee (14.9), according to the NCES. Now Sands said in the ""Southeast"" -- which isn't a region defined by the U.S. government and has subjective boundaries. If, for instance, Virginia fits your definition of Southeast, it had a higher pupil/teacher ratio in 2007-08 (17.1) than Florida  (15.8), the NCES found. If you consider Texas or West Virginia in the Southeast, each has a pupil/teacher ratio lower than Florida's. Among the 50 states, Florida was tied for 35th with respect to pupil/teacher ratio in 2007-08, according to the NCES. Another important distinction: Sands said Florida ""averages"" more students in its classrooms when compared to other states. But average class size and pupil/teacher ratios are not equivalent, said Alan Richard, with the Southern Regional Education Board, a nonpartisan group that helps 16 member states create education policy. Class size measures the number of students in a class, most often core math, science and English classes -- while pupil/teacher ratios take the number of students in all types of classes and divide by the number of teachers. Put another way, if 30 high school juniors were in an English class and 10 high school juniors were in an art class, the calculation for class size would likely be 30 but the calculation for pupil/teacher ratio would be 20. Not all states calculate average class size. (At least Tennessee and Kentucky don't, education officials in those states confirmed.) Back to what Sands said: His broader point -- that Florida has more students in its classrooms than other states -- is largely true, as measured by pupil/teacher ratios. But Sands said ""Florida still averages more students in its classrooms than any other state in the Southeast,"" and there are at least three caveats to his statement: In our minds, that's enough asterisks to knock Sands' statement to Half True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/06/franklin-sands/florida-democrat-says-state-last-among-southeast-s/

Perry says the HPV vaccine he mandated would have been optional
","
When Gov. Rick Perry issued an executive order in 2007 requiring all Texas girls to receive a vaccine against the human papillomavirus before entering the sixth grade, lawmakers balked and blocked it.

Critics said the vaccine, Merck & Co.'s Gardasil, was too new to declare safe. Some said too that Perry's order would infringe on parental rights or give girls a false sense of security, leading them to be sexually active too young.

Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, one of Perry's opponents in the GOP gubernatorial primary, frequently slams Perry's stilled order.

Perry has stood by his action, most recently casting it as having created an optional vaccination requirement.

""That piece of legislation was not mandatory, in the sense of when you can say no, something's not mandatory,"" he said during the second Republican gubernatorial debate Jan. 29.

A just-say-no gubernatorial order? We decided to check.

What we found: On Feb. 2, 2007, Perry issued an executive order — not a piece of legislation, as he said — requiring the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to adopt rules mandating all girls entering sixth grade to receive a vaccination against the types of HPV, a sexually-transmitted virus, that causes most cases of cervical cancer and genital warts.

The order included an opt-out ""in order to protect the right of parents to be the final authority on their children's health care."" Perry ordered the Department of State Health Services to allow parents dissenting for philosophical or religious reasons to request a conscientious objection affidavit form. That form, which has been available since 2003, enables parents to enroll their children in public school even if they lack state-required immunizations. It's automatically granted as long as parents provide all required information.

According to the Department of State Health Service's 2008-09 immunization report, which uses data from kindergarten and seventh-grade students at 1,300 independent school districts and 800 private schools, 0.28 percent of the students filed conscientious objection forms.

Parents must renew exemption affidavits every two years to maintain their validity, according to Allison Lowery, assistant press officer at the Texas Department of State Health Services.

We thought the opt-out form for public-school students proved Perry correct until we learned that not all private schools accept the affidavit. That means some private schools may not allow their students to exempt themselves from any state-required vaccinations. Some 15 percent of more than 1 million Texas girls in fifth through 12th grade in 2008 were enrolled in private schools, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.


According to a 2006 Texas Attorney General's opinion: ""A private school that does not accept state tax funds is not required to accept for enrollment a child who has received an exemption from the immunizations required by the Texas Health and Safety Code.""

In its policy for Catholic schools, the Catholic Diocese of Austin states: ""Immunizations are not in conflict with the Catholic faith. Conscientious objections or waivers, which may be permissible for enrollment in public schools, do not qualify as an exception to this policy."" Catholic schools in the diocese do accept medical exemptions, meaning if the immunization could somehow harm the child, it's not required to enroll.

We wondered if the diocese's policy in favor of requiring state-mandated immunizations would have extended to refusing the opt-out form for girls subject to the HPV vaccination.

Perry aides may have had the same question. According to internal e-mails published online by Hutchison's campaign (also obtained by the Austin American-Statesman under Texas open records laws in 2007), Brandon LeBlanc, then the governor's community affairs public liaison, wrote Feb. 6, 2007: ""I don't have an answer for the questions I'm getting regarding private schools. Apparently Catholic schools in particular will require all state vaccines, but won't except (sic) the exemptions. My first inclination, assuming this is true, is that this is for the parents and the schools to sort out. Is there a better answer to this 'problem'?""

Nora Belcher, then assistant director at the Governor's Office of Budget, Planning and Policy, replied: ""I believe in the short term your answer is the correct one, plus, enrolling in Catholic school is a CHOICE (for parents, anyway).""

In February 2007, the Roman Catholic Bishops of Texas came close to saying they wouldn't require the vaccine, issuing a statement recommending that ""civil authorities should leave this decision to parents.""

But would parochial schools absolutely have left that particular vaccination decision to parents? Margaret McGettrick, director of education at the Texas Catholic Conference, the statewide association of the Roman Catholic diocese in Texas, recently said the superintendents, bishops and accreditation commission at the association responsible for setting school policies never formulated policy specific to the HPV vaccine.

McGettrick said ""it's a non-issue for us"" because the HPV vaccine was never added to the state's list of required immunizations once lawmakers froze the order until the starting date of the 2011 regular legislative session.

Allison Castle, Perry's press secretary, said: ""We consider (the order) null and void and (Perry) will not pursue it in the future.""

En breve: Perry did issue an order requiring schoolgirls receive the HPV vaccine. In arguing that his order was not a mandate, Perry points to the Conscientious Objection to Immunization form that lets parents of public school students decline immunizations without consequence. The burden to file and refile the notarized forms on time falls on the parents.

However, our research determined that it's not certain the opt-out would have been accepted for the 15 percent of Texas girls attending private schools. Also unknown: Whether every Catholic school would have allowed students subject to Perry's order to abstain from the three HPV shots in the vaccination series.

Ultimately, the governor issued an order for the Health and Human Services Executive Commissioner to ""adopt rules that mandate the age appropriate vaccination of all female children for HPV prior to admission to the sixth grade.""

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a mandate is ""a clear instruction, authorization or direction."" Perry says the executive order wasn't mandatory, which, according to Webster, means ""demanded or required.""

But that's what Perry's order did: it set up a requirement. Just because there's a loophole — a way to ""say no,"" in the governor's parlance — doesn't mean the requirement doesn't exist. Physical education classes are also mandatory to graduate high school, but if you have any number of health conditions, you can skip the timed mile.

We rate Perry's claim Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",/factchecks/2010/feb/06/rick-perry/perry-says-hpv-vaccine-he-mandated-would-have-been/

Gregg claims that TARP money must be used to pay down the deficit
","President Barack Obama has proposed a boost for small businesses, but Sen. Judd Gregg isn't hot on the idea.In a hearing about the administration's latest budget, Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican, criticized the White House for proposing to use funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, an initiative originally intended to keep the banking system from collapsing, to help community banks lend to small businesses. Gregg said it violates TARP rules.""The whole concept of the TARP was that as we recoup the money ... and as we recoup that money, we would use it to pay down the debt,"" Gregg said, responding to Obama's Feb. 2, 2010, proposal to transfer $30 billion from TARP to a new program that will support small business lending. ""Now that's not going to happen. ... It's become a piggy bank. ... The law is very clear! 'The monies recouped from the TARP shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for the reduction of the public debt.'"" Peter Orszag, Obama's budget chief, defended the proposal.""The degree to which shifting funds would add to our debt or deficits depends on what the net subsidy rate would be on that new activity,"" he told Gregg. ""And remember, the purpose of TARP was to address problems in our financial markets ... and it has been remarkably successful in bringing credit spreads back down to normal levels. One of the lingering problems in our financial markets, however, is access to credit for small businesses.""Late in 2009, Obama ran into similar criticism from Republican lawmakers after he announced that he wanted to use unspent TARP money for tax breaks for small businesses and investments in infrastructure projects, among other things. Then, U.S. Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, chairman of the House Republican Conference, said, ""To use money from the TARP fund in the manner that is being discussed by the White House and congressional Democrats would be a violation of the law, and it would betray the trust of the American people."" We found Pence's claim to be Half True. On one hand, the TARP legislation is quite clear: Section 106, Part D of the TARP legislation: ""Revenues of, and proceeds from the sale of troubled assets purchased under this Act, or from the sale, exercise, or surrender of warrants or senior debt instruments acquired under section 113 shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for reduction of the public debt."" But we also talked with budget experts who said that Congress could get around those rules in a number of ways. For example, Congress could rescind the TARP money and then, in a separate action, use it to pay other expenses, said Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""Congress can of course vote to spend new money on anything it wants,"" Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, told us in December.In Gregg's case, though, he's strictly talking about what the law says, that TARP money cannot be used for anything other than deficit reduction. He's right and we find his claim True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/05/judd-gregg/gregg-claims-tarp-money-must-be-used-pay-down-defi/

Obama criticizes Republicans who opposed stimulus, then claim credit for projects it funded
","Twice recently, President Barack Obama has slammed congressional Republicans for voting against his economic stimulus bill in February 2009 but later touting provisions of the bill that benefited their own constituents. During his Jan. 29, 2010, question-and-answer session with House Republican lawmakers in Baltimore, Obama brought up the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as the stimulus is officially known: ""There was an interesting headline in CNN today: 'Americans disapprove of stimulus, but like every policy in it.' And there was a poll that showed that if you broke it down into its component parts, 80 percent approved of the tax cuts, 80 percent approved of the infrastructure, 80 percent approved of the assistance to the unemployed. Well, that's what the Recovery Act was. And let's face it, some of you have been at the ribbon-cuttings for some of these important projects in your communities."" Then, on Feb. 2, 2010, Obama riffed on the same theme during a town hall event in New Hampshire: ""I have to point out, though, that some of the very same folks in Congress who opposed the Recovery Act -- and claim that it hasn’t worked -- have been all too happy to claim credit for Recovery Act projects and the jobs those projects have produced. (Applause.) They come to the ribbon-cuttings and ... (laughter). They found a way to have their cake and vote against it, too. (Laughter.)"" We decided that a claim that bold, repeated in two high-profile events within a week's time, was worth a fact-check.  As it turns out, we found several cases in which lawmakers voted against the measure but later claimed credit for provisions or projects stemming from the stimulus bill. -- Rep. Don Young of Alaska. Young, who has served in Congress since 1973, sent out two press releases on Feb. 13, 2009, the day the House passed the final version of the stimulus bill.  One was headlined, ""Rep. Young Votes NO On Democrats’ Massive Spending Bill."" It quotes Young saying, ""This bill was not a stimulus bill, it was a vehicle for pet projects, and that’s wrong."" Young's second release of the day was headlined, ""Rep. Young Wins Victory For Alaska Small Business."" It explains how Young, after lobbying by the Alaska Federation of Natives, targeted a provision from the stimulus bill that would have required competitive bidding for stimulus grants and contracts. The Alaska Natives group said the provision could have hurt its members' ability to benefit from Small Business Administration programs. Young, the release said, ""worked with Members on the other side of the aisle to make the case for these programs, and was able to get the provision pulled from the bill."" In the release, Young said that “no matter if I supported this bill or not, I would make sure [Alaska Natives] were not hurt by it."" -- Rep. Geoff Davis of Kentucky. Davis, a three-term congressman, issued a news release on Jan. 28, 2009, the day of the first House vote on the stimulus, in which he was quoted saying that ""this so-called ‘stimulus’ legislation is full of pet spending projects that will do very little to restore confidence in our economy or create jobs."" But 11 months later, on Dec. 16, 2009, Davis sent out a release announcing the awarding of a $1 million-plus grant for the Carroll County School District. ""Congressman Geoff Davis is pleased to announce that the Carroll County School District has been awarded $1,044,140 in funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) Early Head Start Expansion Program,"" the release stated. It goes on to say, ""In these difficult economic times, it is critical to ensure that vulnerable populations in Kentucky have access to important support services like those provided by the Early Head Start program. This important grant will allow Carroll County School District to expand their ability to provide needed assistance to local low-income families and children. I am very proud of the work that the Carroll County School District is doing to strengthen their community, and I am pleased that our office was able to assist them in obtaining these funds.” As it happened, on the very same day, Davis sent out a separate release in which he referred to the ""failed trillion-dollar 'stimulus' bill.""  -- Rep. Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania. Shuster, elected in 2001, is a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. During the stimulus debate, he advocated for targeting the measure more directly toward infrastructure spending. A Jan. 28, 2009, news release from his office said that ""President Obama told the American people that he would stimulate our economy by rejuvenating our infrastructure. As a longtime advocate of improving our nation’s infrastructure, Shuster was encouraged by this announcement. Unfortunately, the Democrats in Congress, led by Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi, squandered this historic opportunity to create jobs and strengthen the backbone of our economy in order to fund 40 years of pent-up liberal pet projects."" In November, the Blairsville (Pa.) Dispatch reported that Shuster attended a ceremonial groundbreaking for a new facility at a sewage treatment plant in Blairsville. According to the newspaper, the $12.1 million project was funded in part by federal stimulus money. -- Rep. Phil Gingrey of Georgia. In a Feb. 13, 2009, news release, Gingrey, a four-term congressman, explained his vote by saying that ""this ‘stimulus’ bill only perpetuates the dangerous myth that government spending will fix this economy. ... The truth is government spending will only bury future generations in more debt."" In October, a photograph in the Cedartown (Ga.) Standard showed Gingrey handing over a giant, ceremonial check for $625,000 in stimulus money to municipal leaders. The money was to pay for ""new sidewalks, landscaping and other improvements to the downtown area,"" according to the newspaper. A Gingrey spokeswoman told the Standard that because the project qualified for federal stimulus funds as ""shovel-ready,"" Gingrey ""presented the proposal at the federal level."" City commissioner Scott Tillery described Gingrey to the newspaper as ""our point man when we need action from the federal government. His staff is always interested and involved in local concerns, and the congressman will use his influence to make a case for his constituents.""  -- Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina. Burr voted against the stimulus yet appeared in person to present a $2 million-plus stimulus grant to help build a fire station to house the Bethlehem Community Volunteer Fire Department.  ""This is a great thing for this county,"" Burr said, according to the Hickory (N.C.) Daily Record. ""We're not accustomed to federal dollars in that magnitude finding their way to North Carolina."" A spokesman for Burr told the Associated Press in October that he wasn't taking credit for the money. ""Sen. Burr was invited to the grant presentation by the Alexander County commissioners and was happy to be there to recognize the community and the fire department for their work in securing this highly competitive grant,'' the spokesman said.  In an interview with Politico, Burr added, “Just because I voted against the stimulus doesn’t mean I shouldn’t recognize the merit achievement of an entity.”  None of the four House members cited above responded to a query from PolitiFact. But the spokesman for one senior Republican lawmaker -- House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia -- did return our call. He argued that the Democratic criticism is overblown. Cantor, a leading stimulus opponent, has taken heat from Democrats for organizing a job fair whose participating employers benefited from stimulus funding, as well as for helping local officials lobby for stimulus money to support a high-speed rail link between Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Va. Brad Dayspring, Cantor's spokesman, defended both efforts, saying that, in the first case, the congressman was simply trying to help his unemployed constituents get back to work, and, in the second case, he was continuing his longstanding efforts to boost high-speed rail. Cantor's advocacy on the rail issue dates back a decade, to his tenure in the Virginia legislature. On the broader question of why Cantor opted not to support the bill, Dayspring said that the congressman made his decision based on his opposition to the vast majority of the bill's provisions. ""The bill was so flawed, he voted against it despite his overwhelming support"" for the rail provision, Dayspring said. ""If you support 1 percent of a bill and oppose 99 percent, are you expected to vote for it?"" Let's return to Obama's claim. The president said that Republicans who voted against the stimulus ""have been all too happy to claim credit for Recovery Act projects and the jobs those projects have produced."" We found at least two lawmakers -- Young and Davis -- who aggressively criticized the stimulus bill yet sent out a news release touting their own role in helping constituents benefit from the bill. In the meantime, Obama also said that some opponents of the stimulus have ""come to the ribbon cuttings"" for projects funded by the bill. Shuster, Gingrey and Burr clearly attended such ceremonies. To us, five clear cases are enough to validate the president's assertion that some stimulus opponents have ""found a way to have their cake and vote against it, too.""

Ron Paul claims money supply has doubled
","Joining the chorus of critics of Washington's handling of the economy, Rep. Ron Paul used a Jan. 26, 2010, column on his Web site to criticize the Federal Reserve:""We have been on a disastrous course for a long time. The money supply has doubled in the last year, our debt is unsustainable, the value of the dollar is going to continue its drop, and those Americans who understand where we are headed feel helpless and held hostage by foolish policymakers in Washington,"" wrote Paul, a Texas Republican who ran for president in 2008.We were intrigued by his claim that the ""money supply has doubled in the last year,"" a statement Paul has made before in editorials and speeches on the House floor. The money supply is the total amount of money that is available in the economy at any given point. Some economists focus on it because of theories that a larger supply can lead to long-term inflation. There are several ways to measure it (and they sound like the names of British spy agencies): M1, M2 and M0.M1 consists primarily of general currency (i.e., cash in your wallet) and checking accounts. In December 2009, M1 was $1.7 trillion. M2 is more inclusive: it includes all of the money counted under M1, plus savings accounts. In December 2009, M2 was $8.5 trillion. We started by looking at changes in M1 and M2. From January to December 2009, M1 increased 7.6 percent, while M2 grew by about 2.8 percent -- far short of the doubling Paul claimed. We contacted Paul's office to ask about the source of his claim. A spokeswoman directed us to a chart of bank reserves and the monetary base (which is known as M0) over the past two years. And this is where things get a little tricky.M0, just like M1 and M2, can be used as a measure of the money supply. It consists of the currency in circulation, the money stored in bank vaults, and commercial bank deposits with the Federal Reserve. One economist told us it is ""the raw material for the money supply."" From January to December 2009, M0 grew by 19 percent. But in a slightly longer period that includes the fall 2008 response to the economic crisis, it grew by 139 percent. What accounts for the large discrepancies? Robert Barro, a Harvard University economist, told us that M1 and M2 experienced a much slower growth due to the ""very large increase in holdings of excess reserves by financial institutions."" In other words, although there is technically more money in the economy, the banks haven't been lending that money, and have instead been storing it as reserves. Because M0 counts reserves while M1 does not, it follows that M0 has been booming, while M1 is only slowly tagging along. According to Barro, Paul's argument ""is correct in spirit but not quite right on the details."" Indeed, although there is some debate about this in economic circles (we're reminded of the old joke that economics is the only field where two people can get a Nobel Prize for saying exactly the opposite thing), two economists that we spoke with -- Allan Meltzer from Carnegie Mellon University and Iwan Azis from Cornell University -- told us that economists generally measure money supply with M1 or M2, not M0. And if you want to check the money supply on the Web site for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, it is measured by M1 and M2.  George Selgin, a professor of economics at the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia, also agreed that M1 and M2 are more useful measurements of the money supply than M0. He added that although a doubling of the monetary base ""is, in fact, very significant,"" it does not mean that the money supply has doubled. To review. Paul said that the money supply has doubled over the past year. But that's not the case if we rely on M1 and M2, the measurements economists generally use when they talk about the supply. Paul's claim is based on the M0 -- the monetary base and bank reserves -- which did increase significantly due to explosive growth in the reserves. But most economists do not rely on it as much as they do on the other two.So we find the statement to be Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/05/ron-paul/ron-paul-claims-money-supply-has-doubled/

Texas has the 43rd best graduation rate in the United States

Democrat Bill White, the former Houston mayor running for governor, has said if elected, he'll ""move Texas forward"" — a vow he's said will include revamping education.

""Texas should be America's great state of opportunity,"" White says in his first TV ad, which started airing Feb. 1. ""But how can we move forward when our graduation rate ranks 43rd out of 50 states, and we're lagging behind in test scores?""

Almost the bottom of the barrel? We decided to check.

White spokeswoman Katy Bacon pointed us to the the Legislative Budget Board's 2010 Texas Fact Book, which lists everything from elected officials' phone numbers to — we're not kidding — our state snack and tie (tortilla chips and salsa, and the bolo, by the way).

The budget board's depressing ranking indeed matched CQ's, which used data from the National Education Association in Washington and the National Center for Education Statistics to compare the estimated number of public high school graduates in 2009 with the number who were enrolled in 9th grade in fall 2005.

Vermont ranked first, with 96.6 percent graduating. South Carolina ranked last with 55.2 percent; Washington, D.C., isn't included. The national rate of graduating students in 2009 was 69.3 percent.

Texas' graduation rate has been sliding. In 2001 the state ranked 35th, with 65 percent of students graduating from high school. In 2008, Texas ranked 42nd with 62.6 percent of students graduating.

Debra Medina says her name was No. 1 search on night of first GOP debate
","
Debra Medina, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, was little known going into a televised Jan. 14 debate with her well-known GOP opponents, Gov. Rick Perry and U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. But the Wharton businesswoman, making her first run for public office, generated waves of curiosity that night.

Medina subsequently told a reporter for Dallas radio station KERA: ""For the hour after after the debate, 'Debra Medina' was the No. 1 search on Google and for the remainder of the night No. 3.""

For real? We looked into her claim.

Medina's campaign didn't respond to our requests to visit about her statement.

A spokesman for Google said the company doesn't reveal top searches for particular days or on an hour-by-hour basis, so he couldn't speak to whether Medina was the No. 1 or No. 3 search term the night of the first debate. He guided us to Google's online Insights for Search feature, though, which calculates interest in topics over longer time periods.

For most of January into early February, according to the Insights' tool, the top searched items on Google in the United States included Facebook, YouTube and Yahoo. The top-50 most-searched items were rounded out by Amazon, ESPN and AOL.

Our check for searches under Medina's name for the time period showed that Web interest in her spiked twice in January, both times in connection with televised GOP gubernatorial debates, including the first debate Jan. 14.

Kate Morris, an Austin search-engine marketer, told us it's possible that when she made her claim, Medina was referring to the Jan. 14 spike in interest instead of the total number of searches of her name. That explanation made sense after we checked with Google Trends, an online tool that can track how interest in a search topic changes within a given time frame.

Overall, we learned, ""Debra Medina"" was the 13th ""fastest-rising"" search in the United States on Google Jan. 14, spiking into what Google Trends calls the ""Volcanic"" range, its highest indicator of intensified interest. Searches for her name started to climb at 6 p.m., an hour before the one-hour debate started, cresting as the debate ended. Separately, Morris pointed us to a non-Google site based in India that she said indicates Medina was the No. 3 fastest-rising search item nationally as of about 10 p.m. on the debate night.

Google's Insights for Search feature suggests that during January, online interest in Medina in Texas rose more than for the state's other major gubernatorial candidates. Medina's name was searched for 20 times for every 14 searches for Perry and 11 searches for Hutchison. By comparison, the names of Democratic hopefuls Bill White and Farouk Shami were searched for eight and seven times, respectively, for every 20 searches for Medina.

Google spokesman Galen Panger, looking over Medina's surge statistics, said Medina may well have been the nation's ""hottest search"" on debate night, meaning she enjoyed a sudden increase in searches. But that's a big difference from being No. 1 in total searches -- especially when compared to oft-used terms like Facebook. 

Perhaps Medina misspoke to the radio reporter or exaggerated her search ranking on Google. Despite our requests, her campaign never produced evidence to shore up her claim.

Medina enjoyed a spurt of debate-night interest that may have extended through the month. Yet we couldn't find proof her name was the No. 1 or No. 3 search term that evening--and Morris, the Austin expert, said that's surely not so.

We rate Medina's statement as False.",/factchecks/2010/feb/05/debra-medina/debra-medina-says-her-name-was-no-1-search-night-f/

Obama proposed to ax budget of Forest Service program that veered so far astray, it funded a music festival
","In remarks after unveiling his proposed 2011 budget on Feb. 1, President Barack Obama spoke of the need to rein in spending by cutting ""what doesn't work to pay for what does."" Obama boasted that the administration has gone through every department's spending ""line by line"" looking for ""inefficiency, duplication and programs that have outlived their usefulness."" Last year, he said, the administration found $17 billion in cuts; and ""this year, we've already found $20 billion.""And then Obama threw out a few ""commonsense"" examples:""We cut $115 million from a program that pays states to clean up mines that have already been cleaned up,"" Obama said. ""We're also cutting a Forest Service economic development program that strayed so far from any mission that it funded a music festival.""We'll briefly touch on the first example later, but we want to focus on that second one, the proposal to eliminate the $5 million budget for a Forest Service economic development program ""that strayed so far from any mission that it funded a music festival.""Forest Service officials told us the Economic Action Program (EAP) was created in the 1990s to stimulate and assist natural resource-dependent rural communities and natural resource-based businesses to pursue self-sufficiency and sustainability.And what about the music festival Obama mentioned?It's true. The EAP awarded a $10,000 grant to the Pacific County (Washington) Economic Development Council -- which it leveraged with $57,075 of its own funds -- to ""provide partial funding for operation of the 1997 Water Music Festival including hiring local and regional artists and musicians. The Festival will help to enhance tourism and provide cultural opportunities for the small communities in southern Pacific County.""In case you missed it in the middle of the sentence, we reiterate: The music festival was in 1997! The first year of Bill Clinton's second presidential term. The year Comet Hale-Bopp made its closest approach to Earth and the English Patient won the Oscar for Best Picture.Asked about the festival, Becky Rine, a spokeswoman for the Forest Service, explained via e-mail that ""in the late 1990s, the Forest Service awarded a number of small grants to the state of Washington to help small communities hurt by the economic downturn following decreased logging (associated with the spotted owl). Project selection was based on the ability to implement the project quickly and put people to work, as hundreds of logging mills were shut down in the Northwest.""""The music festival funding was not earmarked,"" Rine stated. ""The grant was part of a multiagency revitalization effort for the Pacific Northwest.""The EAP has not funded a music festival since.Still, Forest Service spokesman Joe Walsh acknowledged, ""For sure, that went beyond the scope of the forestry service. We concur that it does not serve the interests of the agency.""But what does the EAP fund these days? Is it still funding projects that stray from the Forest Service mission? We asked the Forest Service press office several times for a list of last year's grant recipients. We finally got this e-mail response from Rine: ""Since 2002, specific funding for projects has not been determined by the Forest Service, because they have been enacted by Congress."" Can you say earmarks?In its formal budget proposal documents, the White House states that the EAP has provided funding for projects that have ""marginal relation to the mission of the Forest Service or to forestry in general,"" though it doesn't provide a timeline. It lists several examples, including the music festival, and adds that ""the program is also duplicative of other USDA programs that can address priority needs in rural areas and assist forest-based industries.""It's almost the identical argument made by the Obama administration when it proposed that the program be cut last year. Congress funded it with $5 million anyway.In fact, it's also the same argument made by the Bush administration, when in 2008 it proposed to ax the EAP's funding. Congress awarded the program nearly $5 million that year, too. Clearly, this program has a patron (or patrons) in Congress who keeps shoving the money back in. But good luck finding out who that (or they) might be, said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan Washington advocacy group that tracks government spending and highlights waste. The same scenario is true for the first example cited by Obama, the proposal to cut $115 million ""from a program that pays states to clean up mines that have already been cleaned up."" Obama proposed a similar cut last year, as did Bush the year before.In other words, Obama administration officials may have gone through the budget line-by-line to find waste, but these two examples were initially identified as wasteful or duplicative by the Bush administration. And when Obama says the administration found $17 billion in cuts last year, and $20 billion so far this year, we're not talking about $37 billion in total cuts.""A lot of the cuts are repeat customers from last year,"" Ellis said.Interestingly, Obama did not mention the biggest-ticket item on his list this year, the plan to cut nearly $3.5 billion from NASA's Constellation Systems Program, which aimed to resume manned missions to the moon. That proposed cut is not sitting well with some legislators in Florida, home of the Kennedy Space Center, and they have vowed to fight to have the funding restored.When it comes to the two examples cited earlier, we think it's misleading for Obama to say ""we found"" them. Both of the cuts were suggested by Bush in 2008. We also think Obama's remarks suggest the administration has identified $20 billion in cuts this year in addition to the $17 billion in cuts it found last year. In fact, many of the proposed cuts this year are repeats from last year that were ultimately overridden by Congress. The two examples cited by Obama here make for good belt-tightening sound bites. But this strikes us as part of the annual budget dance that happens every year: The administration proposes cuts it knows full well will be restored by some anonymous member of Congress who supports the program.And maybe the Forest Service's EAP program is ""not targeted"" or duplicative, as Obama's budget documents suggest, but it's misleading for Obama to employ a way-back machine to discredit a $5 million Forest Service program by citing a $10,000 grant awarded for a music festival in 1997, during the Clinton administration. And so we rule his statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/04/barack-obama/obama-proposed-axe-budget-forest-service-program-v/

McCain flips on 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'
","The military's controversial ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy is back in the spotlight after President Barack Obama pledged to repeal it in his State of the Union speech.On the campaign trail, Obama frequently attacked the policy, which prohibits gays and lesbians from openly serving in the military. His opponent Sen. John McCain signaled he was open to changing the policy, but made it conditional to what military leaders wanted. Here's what he had to say about the issue back in 2006:""I listen to people like Gen. Colin Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and literally every military leader that I know. And they testified before Congress that they felt the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy was the most appropriate way to conduct ourselves in the military. A policy that has been effective. It has worked. ... But the day that the leadership of the military comes to me and says, 'Senator, we ought to change the policy,' then I think we ought to consider seriously changing it because those leaders in the military are the ones we give the responsibility to."" McCain made those comments while speaking to a group of students at Iowa State University during a special taping of Hardball with Chris Matthews in October 2006, when he was considered a likely presidential candidate. McCain didn't formally announce his campaign until the spring of 2007. McCain offered variations of that position during the campaign, at times sounding more firm in his support of the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy. ""We have the best-trained, most professional, best-equipped, most efficient, most wonderful military in the history of this country,"" McCain said during a debate on June 5, 2007. ""There just aren't enough of them. So I have to rely on our military leadership, in whom we place the responsibility to lead these brave young Americans in combat as we speak. ... I think it would be a terrific mistake to even reopen the issue. It is working, my friends. The policy is working. ... Let's not tamper with them.""In May 2009, McCain said in an interview on This Week that he'd be glad ""to have a thorough review of the policy by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and their recommendations,"" but added that, ""right now the military is functioning extremely well in very difficult conditions. We have to have an assessment on recruitment, on retention and all the other aspects of the impact on our military if we change the policy. In my view, and I know that a lot of people don't agree with that, the policy has been working and I think it's been working well.""McCain used similar rhetoric several times throughout 2009, emphasizing his belief that ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" was working and should not be changed. After Obama pledged to repeal the policy in his State of the Union speech, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Michael Mullen and Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee, which McCain co-chairs, how they planned to fulfill Obama's promise. During the testimony, Mullen said, speaking ""for myself and myself only,"" that he is in favor of ""allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly"" in the armed forces. ""No matter how I look at the issue, I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we have in place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens,” he said. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said, ""I fully support the president's decision.""Gates told the committee that a working group would review ways to properly repeal the policy, though Congress must ultimately vote to change the law. The group is due to report on its findings a year from now. McCain -- who had said back in 2006 that he would be guided by military leaders -- told Gates and Mullen that he was ""disappointed"" with the testimony. Overturning the law would ""be a substantial and controversial change to a policy that has been successful for two decades,"" he said in his opening statement. ""It would also present yet another challenge to our military at a time of already tremendous stress and strain... At this moment of immense hardship for our armed services, we should not be seeking to overturn the 'Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell' policy.""Nevertheless, McCain said he would welcome a report on the subject so long as it steered clear of politics and focused only on military readiness and effectiveness.We asked McCain's spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan whether her boss had experienced a change of heart on the policy, and she told us he had not.""Obviously, Sen. McCain does not believe we should repeal 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,'"" she said. Mullen had spoken for himself when he said the policy should be repealed, not for the entire military, she said. If, after the one-year review, the Joint Chiefs agree, ""then Sen. McCain would obviously consider a military leader's decision."" Three years ago, McCain said that he would ""consider seriously changing ['Don't Ask, Don't Tell']"" should the administration's top brass say it was a good idea. On Feb. 2, 2010, those officials showed up in McCain's committee room and said just that. Yet McCain's statements -- reiterated by Buchanan -- make it clear he hasn't budged. So we rate this a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2010/feb/04/john-mccain/mccain-flips-dont-ask-dont-tell/
