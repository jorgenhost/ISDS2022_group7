No evidence Mark Kelly dressed up as Hitler
","As Election Day nears, online posts are making unsubstantiated, disputed claims about Mark Kelly, the Democratic candidate in the Arizona race for the U.S. Senate. An Oct. 24 Facebook post claimed that a yearbook photo showed Kelly ""dressed as Adolf Hitler."" The post repeats information published Oct. 23 by Patrick Howley on a conservative website called National File. Kelly’s campaign said the claims about Kelly are false. ""These aren’t pictures of Mark, and he never dressed up in such a costume,"" Kelly’s campaign manager Jen Cox said in a statement. ""The story is false and should be retracted immediately, and those who have spread this misinformation online should delete it. Anyone using it to try to smear a combat veteran should be ashamed of themselves."" Kelly is an astronaut and a retired U.S. Navy Captain who graduated from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in 1986. He is seeking to unseat Republican Sen. Martha McSally. The Arizona seat is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate races PolitiFact is tracking in 2020. Neither the National File story nor the Facebook post present evidence confirming their claims. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The National File story claimed it ""obtained a series of photos from the 1986 yearbook of Mark Kelly … which show him dressed as Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler for a Halloween party while attending the Merchant Marine Academy."" The story includes a black-and-white photo of a man below what appears to be a Halloween banner, standing next to other people in costume (a woman dressed as a crayon, and men dressed as a pirate, a fencer, and a tourist). The man has a ""toothbrush"" mustache, wears dark sunglasses, a long sleeve dress shirt and dark tie, along with an armband with what appears to be a swastika symbol. The photo does not include a yearbook caption, and it doesn’t say it’s Kelly. The story does not have any quotes from anyone confirming Kelly is in the picture. The story has a picture that it says shows Kelly’s full yearbook page and says that page includes ""a photo of him wearing what appear to be the same pair of sunglasses used in the Hitler costume."" The yearbook page does not include the picture of the man in the costume, nor any reference to the Halloween event. It also does not confirm that the pair of sunglasses are the same or that Kelly is the one in the costume. The story claims that the Halloween event ""was covered heavily in the yearbook"" but provides no evidence that such coverage said Kelly dressed up as Hitler. PolitiFact spoke with three people who say they attended the Merchant Marine Academy at the same time as Kelly. They said that is not Kelly in the picture. Two of the people PolitiFact spoke to said they were in the picture. One of the classmates we spoke to, Ed McDonald, said he is the man dressed as a pirate. Another, Bob Kennedy, said he’s the one dressed in a fencing outfit. They both said the picture shows people who were part of the 2nd Company, and that Kelly was not part of that company. ""I can confirm without a doubt that Mark Kelly was not in the photo,"" Kennedy said. Howley, when challenged about his story, said on Twitter, ""NO ONE has provided any name of an identical student who could have dressed as Hitler. Not smart!"" Online posts claim a yearbook photo shows Kelly dressed as Hitler. Let’s line up the evidence. On one side we have an uncaptioned black-and-white photo that a conservative website says is Kelly, but the only evidence presented is that the person had sunglasses similar to Kelly. On the other are Kelly’s classmates who have gone on the record to say that Kelly is not the person in the picture. We spoke with two people who say they were in the photo in question, and that Kelly wasn’t. At PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the speaker. These claims fall short. We rate the posts False.

Biden’s tax plan won’t tax 401(k) accounts
","Joe Biden’s tax plan has become a regular target for misinformation, with social media posts falsely claiming that it would crush middle-income families, raise taxes on 82% of Americans, and even dissolve the stock market altogether.  Now, a popular post says the Democratic presidential nominee aims to tax 401(k) accounts if he’s elected.  ""Biden slipped up and came out saying he’s going to tax your 401k. Are any of you EVEN paying attention?"" it reads.  This Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post doesn’t cite any evidence or sources backing up its claims. We looked for a literal statement from Biden to this effect and didn't find one. The Biden campaign platform doesn’t include any reference to a tax on 401(k) accounts.  The only proposal that the post could be referring to is Biden’s plan to balance out retirement plan tax benefits so that they apply equally to people across incomes. Biden would do this by replacing the current deduction for retirement account contributions with a 26% refundable tax credit.  Tax policy experts told us that it’s still misleading and inaccurate to characterize this plan as a ""tax"" on 401(k) accounts. Here we’ll break down the proposal in detail, tackling both its direct and indirect impacts.  Under the current tax system, taxpayers get to deduct contributions to 401(k)s when they calculate their adjusted gross income on their income tax returns. Later, when those funds are withdrawn in retirement, the person will pay deferred taxes on their contributions and earnings.  This system tends to benefit upper income earners more than those with lower income, tax policy experts told us.  For example, a person with $8,000 of taxable income is currently subject to a 10% income tax rate. If this person contributed $100 to a retirement account, their taxable income would go down from $8,000 to $7,900, allowing them to save $10 in taxes. On the other hand, a person with $530,000 of taxable income is currently subject to a 37% tax rate. If this person contributed $100 to a retirement account, their taxable income would go down from $530,000 to $529,900, allowing them to save $37 in taxes. ""Even though these taxpayers both deducted the same amount of money from their taxable income, they save different amounts on their tax bills because they face different marginal tax rates,"" said Erica York, an economist with the Tax Foundation. ""This phenomenon is true across all deductions."" Biden’s proposal aims to equalize the benefit of retirement contributions across income scales by giving people a 26% refundable tax credit deposited directly into their retirement account instead of a deduction. This would mean that each taxpayer would receive a flat benefit for contributions, rather a benefit that increases in proportion to taxable income. In effect, taxpayers in lower income brackets would see larger benefits from Biden’s plan, while taxpayers in higher income brackets would see reduced benefits.  Gordon Mermin, senior research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said that it’s not accurate to characterize the Biden plan as a tax on 401(k) accounts, because these accounts would still be tax subsidized for everyone.  ""End of the day, everyone still sees their taxes reduced when contributing to a 401(k).  Some contributors with incomes below 400,000 will get larger tax subsidies than under current law, some with incomes below 400,000 will see no change in their tax break for saving, and contributors with incomes above 400,000 will generally get smaller tax subsidies than under current law,"" he wrote in an email to PolitiFact.  A Facebook post claims, ""Biden slipped up and came out saying he’s going to tax your 401k.""  Biden doesn’t want to tax 401(k) accounts. Instead, he wants to balance out retirement plan tax benefits so that they apply equally to people across incomes by replacing the current deduction with a 26% refundable tax credit.  Tax policy experts said that it’s misleading to characterize Biden’s proposal as a tax on 401(k) accounts, because everyone would still see their taxes reduced when contributing to a retirement account.

Presidential candidates had notepads at podiums, not iPads
","Before the final presidential debate on Oct. 22, Eric Trump, one of President Donald Trump’s sons, suggested that his father and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden should have empty podiums.

No, Trump did not vote twice in Nov. 3 election
","President Donald Trump, who has bashed voting by mail, showed up in person at an early voting site in Palm Beach County to vote Oct. 24. But some posts on social media suggest he voted twice — once by mail, and once in person. ""Did this slip by anyone else because not me. He voted twice. He is committing voter fraud. Oh Irony! How he mocks thee!"" stated an Oct. 24 Facebook post. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The Facebook post includes a link to an Aug. 19 NPR story about how Trump voted by mail in Florida’s primary. The post also includes a link to a TV news report about Trump voting in person. Wendy Sartory Link, the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections, was at the library early voting site when Trump cast a ballot in person. ""I can absolutely confirm that he did not vote twice in November,"" she told PolitiFact the next morning. While Trump has repeatedly attacked voting by mail, he used it himself twice earlier this year. A representative picked up ballots for Trump from the elections office, which is allowed under Florida law. Link confirmed that Trump voted using that method for the presidential preference primary in March and the state primary in August. Trump is registered to vote using his Mar-A-Lago address. Leading up to the Nov. 3 election, reporters were eager to report if he planned to vote in person. At PolitiFact, we regularly checked the Palm Beach County website to look up Trump and saw no request for a mail ballot. The Miami Herald reported Oct. 19 that Trump had not yet requested a mail ballot, although he still had time. A couple days later reporters from the Wall Street Journal and Politico tweeted that Trump planned to vote in person at an early voting site. Election officials have procedures to prevent a voter from casting a ballot by mail and then voting in person.  In Palm Beach County, workers check in voters at polling sites using an electronic poll book. If a voter has already voted by mail, the voter won’t be allowed to vote a second time.  If a voter casts a ballot by mail, and then goes to vote in person before that completed mail in ballot has been received by the county, the mail-in ballot will eventually be rejected, Ashley Houlihan, general counsel for the Palm Beach Supervisor of Elections, previously told PolitiFact.

U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson confuses and misses on claim about COVID-19 deaths
","U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has raised eyebrows more than once during the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this year, he noted most people survive COVID-19 and argued governments shouldn’t shut down economies to contain the virus. The senator himself tested positive in early October and said he would wear a moon suit if needed to vote in person to confirm Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.  On Oct. 21, 2020, Johnson, a Republican, made another comment that turned heads in Wisconsin, where cases of COVID-19 continue to skyrocket and overwhelm hospitals.  ""Unfortunately, we’ve had more deaths, but generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we’ve flattened the curve,"" he said on a call with Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce. ""We’ve gotten better at treating it."" Is he right that deaths are ""pretty flat because we’ve flattened the curve""? Let’s dig in.  Johnson’s claim came as part of his legislative update for the WMC, the state’s largest business lobby. Here’s his full statement about COVID-19 deaths, which he made after WMC president and CEO Kurt Bauer asked the senator how he was feeling:  ""I think it’s important to note, and I heard a little bit of your earlier presenter, as we’re struggling with, there’s no doubt about it, a surge in cases — we had another record day yesterday in COVID — unfortunately, we’ve had more deaths, but generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we’ve flattened the curve, we’ve gotten better at treating it, we know about the anti-inflammatories and steroids and convalescent plasma, which will hopefully be available here shortly."" According to the state Department of Health Services, COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wisconsin are at their highest ever. The state’s worst day came Oct. 21 — the same day Johnson made this claim — when officials reported 48 deaths, surpassing a previous record of 34 reported on Oct. 13. As of Oct. 22, 2020, the seven-day average for deaths sat at 21. In the spring, by contrast, the number of deaths reported in one day peaked at 22, and the seven-day average never surpassed 13. ""Of course the curve has not flattened and we don't have the virus under control,"" Patrick Remington, a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologist and director of the preventive medicine residency program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. When asked for evidence to support the senator’s claim, spokesman Ben Voelkel said Johnson was ""talking about flattening the curve of deaths nationally — ‘generally,’ as he puts it."" Voelkel said that statement is supported by statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the New York Times.  But Johnson began by mentioning the recent spikes in Wisconsin and was speaking to a group of Wisconsin business leaders, leaving listeners with the impression that he meant death numbers here. He made no attempt to distinguish statewide trends from national.  Johnson also revisited the point during a telephone town hall the next day, saying ""we can see the light at the tunnel nationally on this."" ""We have a dramatic increase in cases in Wisconsin,"" he said. ""And again, the good news is, if you do look at the number of deaths, those have kicked up as well, but it’s still relatively flat. It hasn’t followed the same uptick in terms of number of cases."" Let’s take a look at the national data cited by Johnson’s staff.  According to the New York Times, daily reported coronavirus deaths peaked in mid-April, with some days exceeding 2,700 nationwide. More recently, that number ranged from 267 deaths on Sept. 27 to 1,208 on Oct. 21. However, the more telling seven-day average largely stayed in the 700s over the past month. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks deaths weekly, pointed to similar trends: a peak in mid-April followed by a slight increase around August and a decline since early September.  So, from that perspective, Johnson’s claim is more on point. Deaths have decreased overall since the pandemic’s onset, and seven-day averages reported by the New York Times remained steady in recent weeks even as daily numbers fluctuated.  There is a problem here, though. Johnson attributes the ""pretty flat"" deaths in part to a flattening of the curve, which typically refers to the number of cases. And the United States clearly has not flattened the curve.  As Johns Hopkins University has noted, flattening the curve ""involves reducing the number of new COVID-19 cases from one day to the next"" to help prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed.  Data from the university show the United States is doing the opposite — the seven-day average has risen steadily since September.  On a call with Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, Johnson said, ""Generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we've flattened the curve."" Cases are up nationwide and in Wisconsin, so the curve of new cases has not been flattened. And deaths in Wisconsin are at an all-time high, even if nationally they have been more stable.  A Johnson spokesman argued the senator was referring to national trends when he spoke. However, he made the claim in the context of discussing the situation in Wisconsin, and even if one were to use a national perspective, he’s only partially correct. A statement is Mostly False when it contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That fits here.","[('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Sen.

Biden wrongly claims Obama policies released 38,000 federal prisoners
","Squaring off with President Donald Trump over criminal justice reform during the final debate before Election Day, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wrongly claimed the Obama administration's policies ""released"" 38,000 federal prisoners while he was vice president. ""38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison,"" Biden said, responding to Trump’s claim that Biden and President Barack Obama ""got nothing done"" on the matter.  The federal prison population did shrink under Obama for the first time since President Jimmy Carter was in office — but not by 38,000, and not because 38,000 prisoners were released. The first problem with Biden’s claim is with the number he cited. The Biden campaign pointed to data from the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics showing that the federal prison population dropped from a peak of 217,815 people at the end of 2012 to 179,898 people by the end of 2018, for a decrease of about 38,000.  The 38,000 figure was cited in a letter civil rights groups sent the Senate leadership in 2018. But the number is misleading, since it compares the high point under Obama with the federal prison count almost two years into Trump’s presidency. The same Bureau of Justice Statistics data shows that there were 201,280 prisoners in federal custody on Dec. 31, 2008, nearly one month before Obama’s inauguration. There were 189,192 by the same day in 2016, with less than a month left in Obama’s second term. That’s a decline of about 12,000 prisoners, not 38,000. The second issue with Biden’s claim is the term ""released.""  The Bureau of Justice Statistics data measures the federal prison population and can be used to show population changes from year to year. It doesn’t track prisoners who were released. ""Released is not the right word here,"" said Kara Gotsch, director of strategic initiatives at the Sentencing Project. ""What we’re talking about is a decline in the population."" The federal prison population changes all the time, Gotsch said. It drops when prisoners finish their sentences or die, for example, and it rises when new prisoners come in. The population has contracted considerably during the coronavirus pandemic, Gotsch said, as start dates for some prisoners’ sentences are getting deferred for safety reasons. Biden framed his point more accurately earlier in the debate. ""The federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration,"" he said. The Federal Bureau of Prisons does keep tallies of the tens of thousands of federal inmates released each year. But the release data doesn’t say much about the Obama administration’s criminal justice reform efforts, which is the point Biden was trying to make.  ""People get released every day just because their sentence ends,"" Gotsch said. That said, Gotsch told PolitiFact that policies implemented by the Obama administration — along with two changes made during Obama’s tenure by the independent, bipartisan U.S. Sentencing Commission — did help drive a decline in the federal prison population. The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, for example, dramatically reduced a 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission approved the retroactive application of some of the new sentencing guidelines.  According to a U.S. Sentencing Commission report, 7,748 crack-cocaine offenders received retroactive reductions to their prison sentences under that change.  The U.S. Sentencing Commission also voted in 2014 to reduce drug sentencing guidelines by two offense levels and apply the change retroactively. That change has resulted in 31,763 drug offenders getting retroactive sentence reductions as of June, according to the commission. Former Attorney General Eric Holder also instituted a ""Smart on Crime Initiative"" that Gotsch said led to fewer federal drug prosecutions. A separate Justice Department initiative urged qualified federal inmates to seek sentence commutations. Obama commuted the sentences of 1,696 people through that program, the U.S. Sentencing Commission found.  Biden said that as part of the Obama administration’s criminal justice reforms, ""38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison."" The 38,000 figure is cherry-picked. It represents the change in the federal prison population from its peak at the end of 2012 to the end of 2018, nearly two years into Trump’s presidency.  The federal prison population did shrink under Obama for the first time in decades, but the true decline from the start to the end of Obama’s presidency was about 12,000 prisoners. The 38,000 figure also describes a reduction in the federal prison population — which can happen for a myriad of reasons — rather than the number of federal inmates who were released under or because of the Obama administration’s policies.

No, Texas does not have lowest taxes and fewest regulations in the U.S.
","For years, Texas Republicans have boasted about policies that they say have drawn out-of-state businesses to relocate to Texas and have led existing businesses to flourish. Former Gov. Rick Perry and others pointed to low taxes, light regulations and a pro-business attitude in describing the ""Texas Miracle"" — a catchphrase that emerged in the Perry era to explain the state’s booming economy. While Perry has faded from mainstream politics after two failed presidential bids, the principles set forth under the Texas Miracle banner have not. U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, R-Austin, continued that line of reasoning in a tweet last Sunday10/18 that praised the state’s economic fortunes. ""Texas is the embodiment of freedom with lower taxes and less regulations than anywhere else in the U.S. — and because of these principles, we’re home to millions of skilled craftsmen and innovators that strengthen our economy every day,"" Williams wrote. It’s true that state Republicans continue to pride themselves on keeping taxes low and regulations light. But claiming that Texas has fewer regulations and lower taxes than any other state stands on shaky ground. ‘Less regulations’ Measuring and ranking states’ regulatory rules has never been straightforward. There are various methods that policy analysts have used to quantify government regulations. Some have taken a simplistic approach by counting words or pages in a government’s regulatory code. Take for instance President Donald Trump who, in 2017, stood next to a stack of 180,000 pages meant to represent the federal government’s burdensome regulatory code and his administration’s deregulatory agenda. With 17 million words, Texas ranks as the seventh-most regulated state by simple word count. Other measurements narrowly analyze a specific area of regulations, or regulations that pertain to a certain industry group. For instance, the Institute of Justice, a libertarian public interest firm, releases an annual report that measures states’ occupational licensing requirements, where Texas is ranked 10th-least burdensome. And others take more anecdotal approaches by using public surveys or surveys of industry stakeholders that measure perceptions of a state’s regulatory framework. For instance, Texas ranks around 28th for the number of people who believe that stricter environmental laws and regulations cost too many jobs and hurt the economy, according to a Pew Research Center survey. In any case, Texas has never ranked as having ""less regulations than anywhere else in the U.S."" as Williams asserts. ""The regulatory thicket in Texas is dense,"" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. ""Generally speaking, it’s a state that has a lot of regulation because of a sizable health care community, the massive chemical manufacturing industry, and a host of occupational licensing restrictions,"" Rottinghaus said. Perhaps the most advanced method for quantifying and ranking states’ entire regulatory framework comes from the Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank associated with George Mason University. In 2019, the Mercatus Center developed State RegData, a tool that uses text analysis and machine learning algorithms to quantify the administrative codes of 46 states and the District of Columbia. Instead of looking at word or page counts of state codes, a method that has been criticized as being too simplistic and arbitrary, State RegData counts the number of times a code uses restrictive or directive terminology, words like ""shall,"" ""must,"" ""may not,"" ""required,"" and ""prohibited."" Comparing state codes this way, Texas ranks as the fifth most regulated state with about 263,000 regulatory restrictions in its text. California topped that list, followed by New York, Ohio and Illinois. ""Just on the basis of, is (Williams’) claim true or not, I would say it’s not true, at least by our measure,"" said James Broughel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center who helped develop State RegData. Rottinghaus and Broughel agree that there is a positive correlation between the size of a state’s population or economy and the volume of its regulations. Last month, Broughel and the Mercatus Center released a study on the relationship between regulatory volume and population size, which hypothesized that larger economies demand more regulations due to the diversity and size of their industries. But even if calculating states’ regulatory volume per population, Texas would still not rank as the least-regulated state in the U.S. According to Broughel’s calculations, Texas has about nine restrictions for every 1,000 residents, which is the fourth lowest in the U.S. after Michigan, Florida and Arizona. Calculating state restrictions per million dollars of gross state product, Texas is the second least restrictive state bested only by California — Texas Republicans’ favorite heel. ‘Lower taxes’ Williams’ other claim, that Texas has ""lower taxes"" than any other state, also is dubious. Texas is one of nine states without an income tax, ""but the overall tax burden is still high,"" said Rottinghaus. ""Texas has a bunch of other taxes, like the franchise (business) tax, gas tax, and ‘sin’ taxes,"" the taxes levied on alcohol, tobacco and gambling, Rottinghaus said. ""These also add up, and in most cases Texas is not ranked the lowest."" According to a 2020 report by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan Washington D.C. think tank, Texas has the fifth lowest overall tax burden per capita, with an average resident paying about 7.6% of their income toward state and local taxes. Another study by the personal finance website WalletHub, found that Texas has the 19th lowest overall tax burden per capita with an average resident paying about 8.2% of their income to property and sales taxes. Our ruling Williams said that Texas has ""lower taxes and less regulations than anywhere else in the U.S."" Texas is a big state with a large population and a diverse array of industries that demand a variety of regulations. There are various ways to quantify and compare Texas’ regulatory volume to other states, yet none rank Texas as having the fewest regulations in the U.S. Williams’ office did not respond to multiple inquiries asking how he figured his statement. Studies also show that despite having no state income tax, its overall per capita tax burden does not rank as the lowest in the U.S. We rate this claim False.","[('Tweet from U.S. Rep Roger Williams, Oct. 18, 2020', 'https://twitter.com/RepRWilliams/status/1317925778017996800'), ('NBC News, Trump cuts red tape at White House event touting deregulation, Dec. 14, 2017', 'No link'), ('Institute for Justice, License to Work, Nov. 2017\xa0', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-cuts-red-tape-white-house-event-touting-deregulation-n829851'), ('Pew Research Center, Public support for environmental regulations varies by state, Feb. 25, 2016', 'No link'), ('Interview with Brandon Rottinghaus, politics professor at the University of Houston, Oct. 21, 2020', 'https://ij.org/report/license-work-2/'), ('Mercatus Center, Quantifying Regulation in US States with State RegData 2.0, Aug. 31, 2020', 'No link'), ('UC Hastings Law, Administrative Law: The Trouble with Counting, 2019', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/25/public-support-for-environmental-regulations-varies-by-state/'), ('Interview with James Broughel, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center, Oct. 21, 2020', 'No link'), ('James Bailey, et al., Larger Polities Are More Regulated, Sept. 2020', 'https://www.mercatus.org/publications/regulation/quantifying-regulation-us-states-state-regdata-20'), ('The Tax Foundation, Facts and Figures, 2020', 'No link'), ('WalletHub, 2020’s Tax Burden by State, June 24, 2020', 'https://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&context=judgesbook')]",/factchecks/2020/oct/23/roger-williams/no-texas-does-not-have-lowest-taxes-and-fewest-reg/

Facebook post misstates number of Biden-owned properties
","Theories about Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s properties, and how he paid for them, continue to circulate on social media, often linking his wealth to foreign entities, without evidence. President Donald Trump circulated a few himself at the Oct. 22 presidential debate. ""Your other brother made a fortune, and it’s all through you, Joe,"" Trump said, after claiming Biden’s brother made millions in Iraq. ""And they say you get some of it. You do live very well. You have houses all over the place."" One such claim appears on Facebook with a viral image that shows satellite photos of four properties, and Biden’s photo in the middle.  The post says Biden has four homes, ranging in value from $3 million to $7.5 million ""on a $200k a year salary,"" reads the Facebook post accompanying the image.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The Bidens own two properties, according to his campaign and several news reports about their  estate: a primary residence in Wilmington, Del., and a vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del.  They’re both shown in the image circulating on Facebook. Forbes estimated those two properties to be worth a combined $4 million last year.  The other two properties in the image aren’t owned by Biden. Biden sold one of them, a DuPont mansion in Delaware pictured in the top-right corner, in 1996. The fourth property, a house in McLean, Va., is a rental.  PolitiFact previously debunked a claim by the president’s son Eric Trump, who miscaptioned the DuPont mansion as Biden’s home in a tweet that questioned the former vice president’s source of income. Biden bought that house for $185,000 in 1975, then sold it for $1.2 million in 1996 after major renovations. The McLean, Va., home, which Biden rents, was sold to a venture capitalist for $4.25 million in 2016, The Washington Post reported.  The Facebook post also makes a misleading reference to Biden’s income. Biden’s salary as a senator varied from $42,500 a year in 1973, when he began serving in the Senate, to $169,300 by the time he left the chamber in January 2009. As vice president for eight years, he earned up to $230,700 a year, while his wife, Jill Biden, continued to teach. In 2016, his last year in office, the couple reported an adjusted gross income of $396,456. But after he left office, both Bidens wrote books, and his financial disclosure form lists dozens of speaking engagements and book-tour events that typically earned him five- and six-figure payments each. The couple, who file their taxes jointly, reported adjusted gross income of about $11 million in 2017. The Facebook post claimed that Biden owns four properties, which range from values of $3 million to $7.5 million, on a salary of $200,000 a year.  Biden owns two of the four properties pictured. He rents a third property in the photo, and the fourth property was a mansion he renovated and sold in 1996.  Biden’s recent earnings from book deals and speaking engagements were far larger than his salary as a government official.  We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('Facebook post, Oct. 17, 2020', 'https://archive.is/I0HNr'), ('Rev.com, ""Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020,"" accessed Oct. 23, 2020', 'No link'), ('Google Maps, accessed Oct. 23, 2020', 'https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020'), ('PolitiFact, ""Eric Trump misidentifies mansion as Biden’s,"" accessed Oct. 23, 2020', 'No link'), ('Wall Street Journal, ""In His Own Words, Joe Biden Was ‘Seduced by Real Estate,’"" accessed Oct. 19, 2020', 'https://www.google.com/maps'), ('Twitter post, Oct. 17, 2020', 'No link'), ('The New York Times, ""An Everyman on the Trail, With Perks at Home,"" accessed Oct. 23, 2020', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/20/eric-trump/eric-trump-misidentifies-mansion-bidens/'), ('New Castle County Delaware Parcel Search, accessed Oct. 19, 2020', 'No link'), ('DelawareOnline.com, ""Search Delaware property records statewide,"" accessed Oct. 23, 2020', 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-his-own-words-joe-biden-was-seduced-by-real-estate-11582885802'), ('United States Senate, ""Senate Salaries,"" accessed Oct. 20, 2020', 'No link'), ('The Washington Post, ""Once the poorest senator, ‘Middle Class Joe’ has reaped millions since he left the vice presidency,"" accessed Oct. 23, 2020', 'https://twitter.com/mmcintire/status/1317547448143929344?s=21'), ('PolitiFact, Fact-checking Joe Biden’s claim about his own income, accessed Oct. 20, 2020', 'No link'), ('Forbes, ""Here’s How Much 2020 Presidential Candidate Joe Biden Is Worth,"" accessed Oct. 23, 2020', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/us/politics/02finances.html'), ('LeadStories, ""Fact Check: Biden Does NOT Own Four Homes Worth Millions and Funded by Foreign Entities,"" accessed Oct. 23, 2020', 'No link'), ('USA Today, ""Fact check: Biden owns 2 of the 4 homes pictured in a viral meme,"" accessed Oct. 23, 2020', 'http://www3.nccde.org/parcel/Details/Default.aspx?ParcelKey=30185'), ('Sussex County Delaware Property Records Search, accessed Oct. 23, 2020', 'No link'), ('ClustrMaps.com, accessed Oct. 23, 2020', 'http://php.delawareonline.com/news/evergreen/real-estate/')]",/factchecks/2020/oct/23/viral-image/facebook-post-misstates-number-biden-owned-propert/

Georgia Rep. Lucy McBath cherry picks in attack on Karen Handel over CDC funding
","In a new ad, Georgia Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath points a finger at her competitor, saying former GOP Rep. Karen Handel’s actions in Congress hindered the nation’s ability to respond to COVID-19.  ""Karen Handel slashed the Centers for Disease Control's ability to fight diseases, cutting millions in research funding,"" the ad’s narrator says over flashing images of a tired medical worker, an empty laboratory and a patient lying in a hospital bed, her eyes closed. The ad ends by stating McBath believes the CDC should be protected, ""not gutted."" But the attack misses due to cherry-picking: What McBath points to as evidence is Handel’s vote for a massive spending bill to avert a government shutdown, not an up-or-down vote on money for the CDC. This is not the first time McBath and Handel are running for the same seat. Handel served in the House from June 2017 to January 2019, after winning a special election. McBath defeated Handel in Handel’s bid for re-election in November 2018. The McBath-Handel rematch is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. It is rated ""lean Democratic"" by the Cook Political Report, meaning it’s a competitive race but that the Democrat appears to have the advantage. In this campaign, we’ve rated one McBath attack on Handel as Half True; a Handel claim about McBath as False; and an attack by the National Republican Congressional Campaign on McBath as False. McBath’s ad cites Handel’s vote in February 2018 for a budget bill, that cleared the House on a 240-186 vote and was signed into law byinto law three days later by President Donald Trump. The measure provided continuing appropriations for numerous federal agencies into March 2018, including the agriculture, commerce, defense, energy, health and human services, interior, justice and transportation departments. The bill was a stopgap measure to avert a government shutdown and keep the government running for six weeks.  The bill called for a reduction of $1.35 billion over 10 years in the CDC’s Prevention and Public Health Fund which, at the time, accounted for 12% of the CDC’s budget.  According to the CDC, the fund must be used ""to provide for expanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public health programs to improve health and help restrain the rate of growth in private and public health care costs."" But a vote for a massive budget bill hundreds of pages long isn’t proof that a representative is voting for, or against, any single provision in the bill. In other words, this was not an up-or-down vote on one portion of the CDC’s budget any more than it was a vote on $14 million in hurricane assistance for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, or on $1 million for the office of the inspector in the Economic Development Administration, both of which also were in the bill. Handel’s campaign acknowledged that Handel voted for the bill that reduced the Prevention and Public Health Fund, but argued that overall, the CDC’s operating plan for fiscal 2019 showed an increase in funding in most areas. It’s worth noting that federal support to build state and local capacity to manage a new viral crisis fell by 50% after 2003. The decline in federal aid spans three presidencies and many sessions of Congress. President Trump sought $100 million in cuts that would have made the situation harder. But Congress ignored the president’s budget plans and largely kept the flow of dollars steady, even increasing them slightly. McBath claimed in an ad that Handel ""slashed the Centers for Disease Control's ability to fight diseases, cutting millions in research funding."" What Handel voted for was a big stopgap funding measure that kept numerous government agencies funded for six weeks and averted a shutdown. It was not an up-or-down vote on CDC funding, though it did include a reduction in one of the CDC’s funds.

Biden’s claim about Trump slashing Medicare benefits misses context about ACA
","It’s a tried-and-true campaign strategy. Candidates go on the attack, claiming their opponent will do harm to Medicare. After all, people 65 and older are good about making it to the polls on Election Day. These voters are also generally motivated to protect the federal health insurance program for seniors. It’s no surprise, then, that in an ad released this month, former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign played the Medicare card. ""Donald Trump is lying about Medicare and Social Security,"" an ominous, mature, male voice warns viewers in the ad. He goes on to say that ""Trump’s pushing to slash Medicare benefits."" Clearly, we’ve heard this dire message before — from candidates of both parties through the years.  We issued a skeptical rating of a claim that Trump promised to gut Social Security and Medicare if re-elected, noting that his deferral of payroll taxes did not mention Medicare at all. But Trump has not mentioned cuts to Medicare benefits on the trail, and he’s promised to make cuts to the program in the future. So what is Biden’s claim talking about? As a rationale for the statement, a Biden campaign spokesperson pointed us to the Trump administration’s support of Republicans’ efforts in a court case, California v. Texas, which seeks to overturn the Affordable Care Act. But the ad does not include any reference or explanation of how the case would impact Medicare benefits.  The legal challenge, brought by a group of Republican attorneys general, is pegged to the 2017 tax bill, which zeroed out the tax that functioned as a penalty for not having health coverage — known as the individual mandate. Without this linchpin tax, the Republicans argue, the entire law should be struck down. They based that on the Supreme Court decision in 2012 that the law was constitutional because the penalty was a valid use of Congress’ ability to levy taxes. In the current case, lower courts have found the law unconstitutional, and a group of Democratic attorneys general appealed to the Supreme Court. Oral arguments are scheduled for Nov. 10. The Trump administration filed a brief in support of invalidating the entire law. Though best known for its vast expansion of health coverage through marketplace plans and Medicaid, the ACA also included a range of consumer protections — such as the ban on discrimination against people with preexisting conditions — and an estimated 165 Medicare-related provisions. The Biden spokesperson pointed to one, which ended Medicare’s so-called doughnut hole. We asked experts for their take. Immediately, we found differences in opinion. That’s a ""perfectly fair claim,"" said Nicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. Closing the doughnut hole matters to many people, he said. Case Western Reserve University law professor Jonathan Adler took a different view. The argument that Medicare would be affected ""is a very aggressive reading of the filing in this case,"" he said, referring to the Trump administration’s brief in support of nullifying the ACA. The next step seemed to be getting a better grasp of what’s at stake. The Medicare doughnut hole refers to the gap in Part D prescription drug coverage that begins after a beneficiary spends a set amount — usually a few thousand dollars. Before the ACA, beneficiaries who reached that threshold were responsible for 100% of their medication costs until they spent enough for catastrophic coverage to kick in, which could be more than $1,000 in additional spending. Even with this coverage, beneficiaries were responsible for 5% of their drug expenditures. (If beneficiaries were responsible for 100% of costs today, people with high drug costs would obviously pay a lot more without the ACA provision.) The ACA would have gradually ended that coverage gap. But, in 2018, Congress adopted changes to expedite the process. As of 2019, the doughnut hole was closed. Adler pointed to that congressional intervention as a step that could keep the doughnut hole closed if the ACA were overturned. Based on this legislative history, the argument could be made that closing the coverage gap was something Congress had an interest in apart from the ACA. Also, since the doughnut hole is officially closed, some analysts said this provision may not be vulnerable to the upcoming Supreme Court decision on the ACA. ""You can make a lot of claims,"" said Gail Wilensky, a former head of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, of the campaign’s effort to tie the legal challenge to the doughnut hole. ""That one is really a stretch."" Other ACA provisions tied to Medicare benefits seem more at risk, such as the one that mandated annual wellness visits and certain preventive services, such as mammograms, bone mass measurement for those with osteoporosis, and depression and diabetes screening, with no patient cost sharing. ""It’s not clear that the administration actively supports any change to the Medicare benefits with the case before SCOTUS,"" said Tricia Neuman, KFF senior vice president and executive director of the KFF's program on Medicare policy. ""But if they didn’t explicitly seek to wall off certain provisions, it is at least conceivable — though maybe not likely — that Medicare benefits in the ACA could be collateral damage."" (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.) According to an amicus brief filed by the AARP, the Center for Medicare Advocacy and Justice in Aging in 2016, an estimated 40.1 million Medicare beneficiaries received at least one preventive service and 10.3 million had an annual wellness visit with no copay or deductible. Other experts pointed to a troubling implication for Medicare: the nullification of the ACA provisions related to costs and slowing the growth of the program’s spending. Those efforts had been credited with extending the solvency of the Health Insurance Trust Fund and slowing the growth in Medicare premiums. It ""would impair the financial fitness"" of the trust fund, said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Trump ""may not say it is his intent to slash Medicare benefits,"" agreed David Lipschutz, associate director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, but overturning the ACA entirely would ""cause chaos writ large."" And, because of the program’s size, that chaos ""would upend the financial markets and the entire health care system,"" according to the brief filed by Medicare advocates. Enter the concept of severability. Many court watchers are quick to say the high court’s decision could go beyond upholding the entire law or declaring it unconstitutional. Instead, the justices could separate or sever parts of it not directly related to the zeroed-out tax penalty, the so-called individual mandate. Of course, the Trump administration argued in its brief that the interwoven nature of the ACA’s provisions demanded that the entire law be invalidated. ""If you just go on that basis, they are not arguing for severability,"" said Van de Water. But others point out another layer that warrants consideration. ""Everyone who comments on this focuses on the administration’s argument for inseverability,"" Adler said. But he said it’s more complicated than that. The Trump administration’s position is ""simultaneously that the entire ACA should be invalidated"" and also that relief should be provided only where injury to the plaintiffs is shown. (The administration defines the plaintiffs as the two individuals who signed on to the original challenge.) Another view is that this point in the administration’s argument is not clear-cut, mostly because it gives no hint as to which programs or provisions would fit into the category of harming the plaintiffs. Ultimately, the fate of the sweeping health law is in the hands of the Supreme Court. ""Legal analysts didn’t anticipate the case getting as far as it has,"" said Lipschutz. But the White House threw its weight behind the lawsuit,"" said Bagley, at the University of Michigan. ""So, they own the consequences. Especially in the context of this presidential campaign."" An attack ad by the Biden campaign states that Trump is ""pushing to slash Medicare benefits"" and ties this charge to the administration’s position on the pending legal challenge to the ACA. The Biden campaign pointed to an ACA provision that sought to close the Medicare doughnut hole to support this claim. It may not be the best example, though, because some experts suggest it may not be as vulnerable as other parts of the law. Experts outlined a range of other Medicare provisions that either provided new benefits or shored up the program’s financial fitness. If the whole law were to be nullified, as the administration has advocated, these changes could also be erased — a step that would affect benefits and potentially cause premiums to rise.

Parson administration did remove almost 100,000 kids from Medicaid, as Galloway said
","Missouri State Auditor Nicole Galloway has argued that Gov. Mike Parson can’t be trusted to expand Medicaid, something voters approved in August. She has made it a cornerstone of her campaign for Parson’s seat. In an Oct. 4 Facebook post, Galloway reinforced her argument by saying the Parson administration ""purged 100,000 kids from Medicaid."" Galloway has repeated this claim in a number of TV ads. In an ad entitled ""First Thing,"" she said that Parson ""cut health care from 100,000 children."" In an ad entitled ""Top Priority,"" she asserts that Parson ""kicked 100,000 kids off their health care."" In an ad entitled ""Urgency,"" she said that Parson responded to rising health-care costs by ""cutting coverage for hundreds of thousands."" The Parson campaign aggressively refutes this claim, going so far as to threaten legal action. PolitiFact Missouri obtained a letter sent by Parson campaign attorney Marc Ellinger to stations running one of Galloway’s ads. The letter, dated Oct. 8, asks that the stations stop running the ad and asserts that it ""contains demonstrably false claims"" and that, among other things, ""the Governor has, at no time, taken any policy decision to change eligibility for children on Medicaid or any other health coverage in Missouri.""  During an Oct. 9 debate, we looked into a similar claim made by Green Party candidate Jerome Bauer who said that he lost his Medicaid ""alongside 100,000 Missouri children who got kicked off Medicaid."" We found this to be accurate. But with a major party candidate making a similar claim, we wanted to take a deeper look at the records. Medicaid is a government program that provides health care to certain low-income people or those with disabilities. Missouri’s Medicaid program is called MO HealthNet, and the Missouri Department of Social Services runs the program. The director of that department is appointed by and reports to the governor. Data from the Department of Social Services shows that from June 2018, the month Parson took office, to December 2019, the number of children enrolled in the program dropped by 96,989. Parson and other Republicans have previously said this is a result of fewer people needing the program due to an improving economy. Experts were skeptical of this explanation. ""It wasn’t the economy,"" said Timothy McBride, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis and former chair of the state MO HealthNet Oversight Committee. ""It was the process they used."" The state government periodically does checks to make sure those receiving the benefits are still eligible for the program. The eligibility requirements are less stringent for children than for their parents. For a child to qualify, their parents must make less than three times the federal poverty level, but for the whole family, they must simply make less than the federal poverty level, so when a parent no longer qualifies, their child might still. After pressure from Democrats for an investigation, top staff at the Department of Social Services acknowledged in a legislative hearing that the state was dropping children from the program when their parents no longer qualified even when the children themselves still did. ""When I talked to people in other states, they were really surprised that that’s how we did it,"" McBride said. ""They said, ‘no, that’s not how it should’ve been done.’ No other state did it that way."" Republicans argued that parents could have simply reapplied for their children, but there is evidence that the program’s eligibility system was flawed and that parents were given little guidance on the process. In several of its regular meetings, the MO HealthNet Oversight Committee discussed this. The minutes from the committee’s August 2018 meeting show that the committee heard from a representative of Legal Aid of Western Missouri who explained that her clients were having trouble getting access to call centers after being denied Medicaid. She said that in July 2018, the average call center wait time was 30 minutes, compared to 4 minutes in February 2017. She also said that dropped calls increased from 4% the year prior to 60% that year. In that same meeting, one of the committee members, Jennifer Tidball, explained that the drop in enrollment can be attributed to the stability of the program’s eligibility system, according to the meeting minutes. In the minutes from the April 2019 meeting, the committee heard from a different legal expert, this one representing Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, who described ""dysfunctional call centers, burdensome paperwork and the inability of receiving any help"" from local offices as issues his clients faced when trying to reapply. We reached out to the Galloway campaign who said they had the same evidence we did. On Facebook and in campaign ads, Galloway said that ""Governor Parson’s administration purged 100,000 kids from Medicaid rolls."" The Missouri Department of Social Services’s data shows that 96,989 children were dropped from Medicaid under Parson’s administration from June 2018 to December 2019. A letter from Parsons’ campaign attorney states that ""the governor has, at no time, taken any policy decision to change eligibility for children on Medicaid or any other health coverage in Missouri."" This does not refute Galloway’s claim though. While Parson's administration may not have taken a formal step to change policy regarding Medicaid eligibility, we found that, under his leadership, the Department of Social Services changed the process for which eligibility is reviewed. That change resulted in 96,989 children being cut from Medicaid when they were still eligible. That’s still about 3,000 children short of Galloway’s claim, but her argument that Parson’s administration removed a huge number of children from Medicaid is still accurate. We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('Nicole Galloway on Facebook, Oct. 4, 2020', 'https://www.facebook.com/NicoleGallowayCPA/posts/4396776683721089'), ('Nicole Galloway, ""First Thing"" Ad on YouTube, Oct. 11, 2020', 'No link'), ('Nicole Galloway, ""Top Priority"" Ad on YouTube, Oct. 11, 2020', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuT0Ky4FYTo'), ('Nicole Galloway, ""Urgency"" Ad on YouTube, Oct. 11, 2020', 'No link'), ('Ellinger and Associates letter, Oct. 8, 2020', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1gMDh1ZlPo'), ('PolitiFact, They said what?

Hartzler’s claim isn’t close: We’re a long way away from herd immunity
","In an 8-minute interview on 93.9 The Eagle last month, U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-4th District, spoke on the timetable of vaccine development and deployment with Operation Warp Speed before claiming, ""We’re starting to reach almost herd immunity in this nation, so we’ll be on the downside of this virus very soon."" The claim touches on two topics: herd immunity and the timetable of the virus. Claims about herd immunity are not new. We’ve covered the subject extensively. RELATED: How helpful can herd immunity be in ending the coronavirus pandemic? No, the U.S. hasn’t achieved herd immunity from COVID-19 Corralling the facts on herd immunity  Hartzler hit similar notes in an October interview with KMIZ/ABC, saying, ""I feel like we will rebound fully just once we get ... get this vaccine developed and we reach herd immunity, which could be fairly soon as well."" We’ve noted before that public health experts say herd immunity is a questionable strategy. Even so, we have a long way to go before we get to herd immunity. Here’s why. Essentially, herd immunity is a numbers game for infectious diseases. The more immune a population becomes, the less likely it becomes for an infected individual to come into contact with a non-immune person and continue the chain of transmission. Herd immunity does not necessarily stop transmission; herd immunity makes transmission less likely. Individuals might gain immunity by getting infected. Or, they can get vaccinated, which isn’t an option yet.   That leaves getting infected, which is not ideal due to the risk of death and known and unknown long-term health effects. However, there’s another problem: Immunity by way of infection might not last long enough because of reported cases of reinfection. The known and unknown health risks of the coronavirus in addition to the uncertainty of the immunity render herd immunity infeasible until there is a vaccine. Scientists’ estimate that 60% to 70% of the population would have to become infected before herd immunity is reached. For reference, that’s more than 200 million Americans. This threshold is where Hartzler’s claim falls apart. At the time of her Sept. 2 claim, 5.8 million individuals had been infected in the U.S., which is around 1.7%. There’s much more than an order of magnitude between the infected population then and the one required. As of Oct. 5, around the time of Hartzler’s KMIZ interview, over 7.2 million individuals had been infected, amounting to around 2.2% of the population – still a long way off from the herd immunity threshold. We tried reaching out to Hartzler’s campaign multiple times for evidence but received no response. Additionally, because the virus is so new, experts still don’t fully understand how immunity to COVID-19 works. Cases of reinfection demonstrate that immunity from a prior infection may not be enough if the virus changes enough to render it ineffective.  Once a vaccine is approved, supply may be limited. Operation Warp Speed aims to accelerate the development, production and distribution of the vaccine, but it will take time to ramp up the supply of vaccine and distribute it. So herd immunity through vaccination is a long way off. Hartzler claimed, ""We’re starting to reach almost herd immunity in this nation, so we’ll be on the downside of this virus very soon."" Without a vaccine, herd immunity relies on infections driving immunity. At the time of the quote – and now – immunity in the United States is far short of that required by estimates. This statement is not accurate. We rate this claim False.","[('93.9 The Eagle, ""(Audio) Hartzler on more relief spending, violence in cities,"" Sept. 2, 2020', 'https://939theeagle.com/audio-hartzler-on-more-relief-spending-violence-in-cities/'), ('KMIZ/ABC, ""Fourth Congressional District: Vicky Hartzler,"" Oct. 7, 2020', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""How helpful can herd immunity be in ending the coronavirus pandemic?,"" June 3, 2020', 'https://abc17news.com/video/election-videos/2020/10/07/fourth-congressional-district-vicky-hartzler-2/'), ('PolitiFact, ""No, the U.S. hasn’t achieved herd immunity from COVID-19,"" Aug. 7, 2020', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Corralling the facts on herd immunity,"" Sept. 29, 2020', 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/jun/03/how-helpful-can-herd-immunity-be-ending-coronaviru/'), ('The Lancet, ""Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a large nationwide sample of patients on dialysis in the USA: a cross-sectional study,"" Sept. 25, 2020', 'No link'), ('US Census Bureau, ""Population Clock,"" accessed Oct. 19, 2020', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/07/facebook-posts/no-us-hasnt-achieved-herd-immunity-covid-19/'), ('World Health Organization, ""Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Weekly Epidemiological Update,"" Aug. 30, 2020', 'No link'), ('World Health Organization, ""Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Weekly Epidemiological Update,"" Oct. 12, 2020', 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/sep/29/corralling-facts-herd-immunity/'), ('The Lancet, ""Genomic evidence for reinfection with SARS-CoV-2: a case study,"" Oct. 12, 2020', 'No link'), ('CDC, ""Frequently Asked Questions about COVID-19 Vaccination,"" accessed Oct. 20, 2020', 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32009-2/fulltext'), ('U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, ""Fact Sheet: Explaining Operation Warp Speed,"" accessed Oct. 21, 2020', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2020/oct/23/vicky-hartzler/hartzlers-claim-isnt-close-were-long-way-away-herd/
"['Coronavirus', 'Michigan', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump says Michigan has been “like a prison.” But most COVID-19 lockdowns ended in June.
","During the final presidential debate, President Donald Trump repeated his call for keeping schools and  businesses open amid the coronavirus pandemic, claiming that Michiganders have been subject to excessive restrictions. ""Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan,"" Trump said, referring to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who issued a stay-at-home order and a number of other emergency measures in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Under her leadership, ""it's been like a prison,"" Trump claimed. Trump has made similar claims this month. ""She keeps her state closed,"" he said of Whitmer during an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Oct. 8. ""The churches are closed. The schools are closed, and the whole state is closed."" In a virtual rally two days later, he told Michigan supporters ""your governor has to open up her state."" Trump’s comments seem to place Michigan residents and businesses under a lockdown. That’s not the case. Whitmer declared a state of emergency on March 10 as the state discovered its first two confirmed cases, and issued the stay-at home order and business restrictions on Mar. 23. But her order was lifted statewide by Jun. 1.  Bars and restaurants across the state reopened shortly afterward, followed by barbershops, spas and salons in mid-June. Casinos in Detroit were allowed to reopen in early August. Schools across the state were allowed to resume in-person learning in the fall, with local districts setting their own criteria for reopening. And by early October, gyms, movie theaters and bowling alleys were cleared to reopen with safety precautions in place. Churches and houses of worship in Michigan were exempt from penalties under the state's order. We reached out to the Trump campaign to explain his comments but didn't hear back. While many governors across the country issued stay-at-home orders at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, Whitmer’s was criticized as extreme or arbitrary. For instance, Michiganders were prohibited from traveling to vacation homes, and big-box stores were required to rope off areas selling nonessential items, such as paint and garden supplies. On April 15, thousands of people participated in a protest outside the state Capitol in Lansing against Whitmer’s stay-at-home order, and drew support from Trump. On April 23, dozens of protesters gathered outside Whitmer’s Lansing residence. And a week later, armed protesters entered the Michigan Capitol. Whitmer’s actions have also faced pushback from the GOP-controlled Legislature, which challenged her emergency powers in court. After the Michigan Supreme Court ruled Oct. 2 that she did not have the authority under state law to issue additional emergency declarations, her administration and the Legislature began working together to enact new laws to respond to the pandemic. Public opinion polls have shown consistent support for Whitmer’s handling of the coronavirus crisis.  But with the restrictions lifted, the number of COVID-19 cases in Michigan is now increasing in the vast majority of the state’s counties. On Oct. 21, Michigan reported an daily average of 1,704 new COVID-19 cases in the last seven days, the state’s highest seven-day average yet. Trump claimed that ""it’s been like a prison"" in Michigan under Whitmer’s leadership during the coronavirus pandemic. Whitmer implemented strict emergency measures in March, but they were mostly lifted across the state by June 1. All businesses and schools are allowed to be open. We rate Trump’s claim False. ","[('The Detroit Free Press, Paul Egan and Kathleen Gray, ""Gov.

Hillary Clinton wrong that no negative ads have hit Bernie Sanders
","Hillary Clinton, who said this week she ""will be the party’s nominee,"" emphasized on Meet the Press that she’s already won more votes than rival Bernie Sanders and she’ll also be the better prepared candidate for the fall. When Chuck Todd pointed out that Sanders fares better than Clinton in head-to-head matchups against presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, Clinton suggested Sanders hasn’t been vetted as thoroughly as she’s been. ""Let me say that I don't think he's had a single negative ad ever run against him. And that's fine. But we know what we're going into, and we understand what it's going to take to win in the fall,"" she said. ""And finally, I would say that, you know, polls this far out mean nothing."" Clinton has a point that compared with her, Sanders hasn’t really felt the burn of negative ad blitzes from Republican groups. But her claim that he hasn’t had ""a single ad ever run against him"" is an exaggeration.   Dem-on-Dem negative campaigning Many of the attacks we found on Sanders in the Political TV Ad Archive actually come from other Democrats, including by Clinton supporters.   Generation Forward, a pro-Martin O’Malley super PAC, went after Sanders while O’Malley was still in the race. In an attack ad, the group highlighted Sanders’ and Clinton’s Saturday Night Live portrayals and less-than-serious moments on the campaign trail (i.e. dancing). It ended with O’Malley saying a presidency shouldn’t be about entertainment. Another ad attacked Sanders for his record on guns: ""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill — background checks and waiting periods. ... Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns."" (We rated the claim about background checks Mostly True.) The Sanders campaign referred us to web videos by Correct the Record, a super PAC hybrid known as a Carey committee that supports Clinton. The group’s YouTube channel includes at least 13 negative videos about Sanders. (Correct the Record said that its videos are not ads as it does not ""do any paid public communications."") One focuses on Sanders’ controversial interview with the New York Daily News and is entitled ""Bernie Sanders’ Sandy Hook Shame."" Another asks, ""Will Bernie Sanders explain why he’s sided with the gun lobby time and time again?"" (This charge is largely inaccurate.) Others focus on Sanders’ ""going negative"" against Clinton and his record with fact-checkers. The Clinton campaign itself sent a President's Day-themed attack ad against Sanders through text messages, BuzzFeed reported. After audio of Sanders saying it would be a good idea if President Barack Obama ""faced primary opposition"" in 2012, the text reads, ""Hillary is the only one in this race who’ll fight for the progress we’ve made under Pres. Obama."" Largely, but not totally spared by Republicans Clinton, who has been a national figure and subject of GOP criticism for decades, is right that she’s faced far more negative campaigning than Sanders has. The Political TV Ad Archive includes some 120 ads either attacking Clinton directly or drawing unfavorable parallels between her and Republican candidates. Besides virtually all of the 2016 contenders on the GOP side, Clinton’s been consistently hit by  conservative super PACs, the Republican National Committee and even some down-ballot GOP candidates. Sanders, on the other hand, has been largely spared by the Republican attack machine this cycle, and Clinton’s campaign sent us several articles to that point. Given that the ads would write themselves (""And everyone knows what that pummeling would focus on: He's a self-proclaimed socialist,"" writes Mother Jones’ David Corn), why are Republicans leaving Sanders alone? The answer seems to be that they don’t really see him as a threat. ""Sanders has an important message that is resonating with many. But that is not enough to win the nomination. Why spend money that will have little return on the investment?"" said John G. Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University who wrote In Defense of Negativity: Attack Advertising in Presidential Campaign and spoke with us in April. In one case, a ""faux attack"" from a conservative super PAC appears to actually bolster Sanders, illustrating another line of argument: Republicans may prefer to run against the more radical Sanders in a general election.   Though Sanders hasn’t been hit nearly as hard as Clinton, he has been attacked by the right a few times. Future 45, a conservative Super PAC funded by backers of Marco Rubio, ran a 30-second spot sounding the alarms on higher taxes to come under Sanders. Sanders is also featured in Republican-on-Republican attack ads as an unfavorable comparison. For example, the anti-Trump Club for Growth has highlighted similarities between Trump’s positions and Sanders’ (as well as Clinton’s and Obama’s). Similarly, American Future Fund, a conservative 501(c)(4) or ""dark money"" group, ran an attack ad against Ted Cruz by lumping him in with Sanders and other Democrats on national security issues. Mike Huckabee’s campaign, meanwhile, warned voters about ""a crazy old man named Bernie"" in a rhyming Christmas-themed ad and crooned ""Hello from the caucus night. If Bernie wins, I’m going to die"" in an Adele-inspired attack. We should also note 2016 is not the 74-year-old’s first time around the block. He has, after all, competed in political races since the 1970s. Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs pointed to ""blistering negative ads in his first Senate campaign."" In 2006, Sanders’ Republican opponent Richard Tarrant spent millions on ads accusing Sanders of wanting to protect child molesters and voting against single-working mothers. They didn’t end up doing much for Tarrant, who lost to Sanders by 33 percentage points. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Let me say that I don't think (Sanders has) had a single negative ad ever run against him.""  The number of attack ads against Sanders pales in comparison to the number against Clinton, but she’s wrong that he’s been completely spared. Democratic groups, including one supporting Clinton, and Republican outfits alike have gone after Sanders. We rate her claim False.

Hillary Clinton's approval ratings as secretary of state were high, but they're not now
","The 2016 presidential race may come down to a contest where the least unpopular candidate wins, with Democrat Hillary Clinton just three percentage points ahead of Republican Donald Trump in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Both candidates have extraordinarily high disapproval ratings, a fact mentioned by Chuck Todd when he interviewed Clinton during the May 22 edition of Meet the Press. He wanted to know how she would get past her negative numbers. Clinton argued that once she gets on a job, whether it's first lady, U.S. senator or secretary of state, she gets things done. ""So I have a track record. And I'm going to remind people of that. Because it's not just rhetoric, for me,"" she said. ""When I was secretary of state, I had a very high approval rating, as you can go back and check. Because I was doing a job that people could see."" The latest NBC News poll shows that 54 percent of registered voters have a negative or somewhat negative opinion of Clinton. Trump scores a bit worse at 58 percent. Only 34 percent view Clinton positively. We wondered if her rating was really very high when she served as secretary of state from January 2009 through Feb. 1, 2013. Clinton's favorability rating has ebbed and flowed during her two and a half decades on the national political scene. Gallup pegged it as low as 38 percent when her husband ran for president in 1992, but the polling firm has said that's because she was wasn't well known. It peaked at 62 percent during her first years as first lady, dropped to 43 percent in 1996 during the ""Travelgate"" investigation, and spiked to its highest point ever — 67 percent — in December 1998 when her husband was impeached for perjury in the wake of scandals involving Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones. By the time she left the White House in 2001, Clinton's Gallup rating was down to 44 percent. Her polling numbers started going up during her time in the Senate and hit another peak of 58 percent in 2007 while a senator and just after announcing she would run for president, according to Gallup. After another dip, it shot up to 65 percent in 2009 when she became secretary of state and stayed high for most of her tenure.  In two polls taken in 2011 and 2012, she was viewed favorably by 66 percent, making her more popular than President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. When she left that position on Feb. 1, 2013, 64 percent had a favorable view of her. Her rating has since declined in the wake of criticism over security at the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and controversy over how she handled her emails. Clinton's campaign pointed us to other polling data. A Washington Post-ABC News poll put her favorability at 67 percent as she was winding down as secretary of state and preparing to testify in a Benghazi hearing. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted at the same time put her approval rating at 69 percent. Are these percentages ""very high,"" as Clinton characterized them on Meet the Press? To get some perspective on how easy it is to get an approval rating that high, we consulted Gallup's Presidential Job Approval Center which goes back to Harry Truman and lists overall favorability ratings, along with highs and lows. In this context, Clinton’s highest numbers were relatively strong. Of the dozen presidents, the six with the highest overall averages are: Clinton also polls well compared to recent secretary of states, according to Gallup. Condoleezza Rice's scores ranged from 59 percent to 63 percent during the George W. Bush administration. But neither comes close to Colin Powell, whose ratings ranged from 83 percent to 88 percent. Our ruling Clinton said, ""When I was secretary of state, I had a very high approval rating."" Polling numbers show that it was, in terms of public opinion, the best period of her political career. She's not even close to those favorability numbers now that she's in a tough presidential contest, but we rate her statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ebb5ba66-fd0e-497e-9318-fc451f807af5","[('NBC News, ""Clinton\'s Lead Over Trump Shrinks to 3 Points: New NBC News/WSJ Poll,"" May 22, 2016', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/clinton-s-lead-over-trump-shrinks-3-points-new-nbc-n577726'), ('Gallup, ""Hillary Clinton Favorable Near Her All-Time High,"" March 30, 2011, ""Hillary Clinton\'s Favorable Rating One of Her Worst,"" Sept. 4, 2015, and ""Presidential Job Approval Center,"" ""Key Statistics"" tab', 'No link'), ('Email, Josh Schwerin, spokesman, Hillary Clinton campaign, May 22, 2016', 'http://www.gallup.com/poll/146891/hillary-clinton-favorable-near-time-high.aspx'), ('The Washington Post, ""Hillary Clinton reaches new heights of political popularity,"" Jan. 23, 2013', 'No link'), ('Pew Research Center, ""Hillary Clinton Favorability Timeline,"" May 19, 2016', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/01/23/record-high-for-hillary-clinton-as-she-faces-little-regarded-congress/'), ('The Huffington Post, ""Hillary Clinton Favorable Rating,"" updated May 22, 2016', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2016/may/22/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-approval-rating-secretary-state-w/

Hemp is helpful, just don’t grow it
","At a senate judiciary hearing on Smith Hill May 10, William Devereaux, a lawyer, spoke on behalf of the Narragansett Indian Tribe. Bill S2763, called the ""Hemp Growth Act,"" was up for debate. It would make it legal for residents to grow their own hemp plants if they have a permit and don’t have a criminal record. The tribe has historically used hemp, a cousin of marijuana, for many products, like blankets, ropes, and baskets, Devereaux said. ""You can import as many hemp products into this country as you want . but we can’t grow it,"" Devereaux said.  We thought this was an interesting point. We talked to Devereaux, and he elaborated. ""I can go to the Whole Foods right now and buy a box of cereal with hemp,"" he said. ""But if I grow it, that’s another story. It’s kind of ridiculous."" Indeed, it does seem kind of ridiculous. We wanted to see if he was right. The history of hemp Currently, hemp is packaged with marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act, Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin wrote in a letter he submitted against Senate Bill 2763. ""Hemp is considered marijuana,"" he wrote. This interpretation came from a few court cases: New Hampshire Hemp Council, Inc. v. Marshall in 2000; U.S. v. White Plume in 2006; and Monson v. Drug Enforcement Agency in 2009. And therefore, ""possession, distribution, manufacture, cultivation, sale, transfer, or the attempt or conspiracy to possess, distribute, manufacture, cultivate, sell or transfer"" hemp is banned. But, this wasn’t always the case. In the 17th century, domestic growth of the plant was encouraged for production of rope, sails and clothes. The Declaration of Independence was signed on hemp paper. Historians even say the first American flags were made out of hemp, grown by none other than George Washington and Andrew Jackson. During World War II the U.S. Department of Agriculture released a ""Hemp for Victory"" propaganda film, offering to give hemp seeds to farmers, and allowing draft deferment to those who would stay behind and grow the plant for military materials (parachutes, ropes, and other things of that nature), according to a PBS Frontline timeline.    In 2014, President Barack Obama signed the Agricultural Act of 2014. Section 7606 of that bill allowed for universities and others to grow or cultivate industrial hemp as long as it's for research purposes, or it’s allowed under state laws. The farmer also must be licensed. Can hemp get you high?  In short, no. The hemp and marijuana plants both come from the Cannabis sativa plant. But, marijuana has much more tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, which is the psychoactive substance that makes you feel high and want to eat an entire pizza. Hemp has a THC level of about 0.3 percent, on average, while marijuana can have up to a 25-percent THC level, according to a 2015 study. As Devereaux put it, ""For you and I to get high on hemp we’d have to put six bales in a fireplace, light it up with lighter fluid and put a blanket over our heads."" Importing hemp Now to the second part of Devereaux’s claim. Can U.S. citizens ""import as many hemp products"" as they want? U.S. Customs and Border Protection  says that hemp products, like paper, rope, clothing, soaps, shampoos, and animal feed, can be imported into the United States. Hemp seeds, as long as they are sterilized, can also be brought into the country. And about that cereal at Whole Foods? A box of Nature’s Path ""Hemp Plus Granola"" will cost you about $5. Our ruling:  Devereaux says ""you can import as many hemp products into this country as you want . but we can’t grow it."" He is correct. The Controlled Substances  Act prohibits the growing and selling of hemp, except under very specific circumstances outlined in Obama’s Agricultural Act. U.S. Customs and Border Protection allows for the import of hemp products and seeds, permitted they are ""sterilized."" We rate this claim: True.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7e31ae32-5f48-4c0b-a9e5-99836a711556","[('Interview, William Devereaux, lawyer, May 19, 2016.', 'http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-fine-hemp-marijuana-legalize-20140626-story.html'), ('FDA.gov, ""Controlled Substances Act,"" accessed May 19, 2016.', 'No link'), ('Attorney General Peter F.

Teamsters say soda tax would cost thousands of jobs; that doesn’t add up
","Most of organized labor -- nearly all -- is just fine with Jim Kenney’s proposed sugary drinks tax. But the Teamsters have a big problem with it. They’re arguing they’ll lose jobs. Opponents to the tax argue higher prices will lead to decreased sales that will eventually trickle down and cause the soda bottling and delivery industry in Philadelphia to collapse. In fact, the loudest voice against the tax (outside lobbyists for the nation’s largest beverage companies) come from the Teamsters. Literally: They organized a ring of 18-wheelers that circled City Hall, horns blaring, to protest the measure. The first-year mayor wants to tax sugary drinks at three cents per ounce -- an unprecedented tax in America -- and use the revenue to fund pre-K, community schools and the city’s ailing pension fund. In a statement, Teamsters Local 830 secretary Daniel Grace wrote that the implementation of a three-cents-per-ounce sugary drinks tax ""would result in the loss of 2,000 family-sustaining Teamster Union jobs and countless other jobs in the beverage industry."" But there are about 2,000 people working in the beverage industry in Philadelphia in total. So we decided to look a little deeper into this claim. The American Beverage Association has claimed a soda tax in Philadelphia would result in job loss, but didn’t offer an estimate to PolitiFact and referred us to a local firm handling communications for those opposed to the tax. That firm also didn’t have an estimate on job loss and referred us to Grace, the Teamsters head in Philadelphia who didn’t respond to requests for more information. Instead, his spokesman Frank Keel emailed: ""The Kenney administration has no idea about the Teamsters’ various roles in the beverage industry and no right to question the very real job losses we'll suffer if this regressive three-cents-an-ounce sugary drinks tax is passed into law."" He again reiterated that ""we stand to lose as many as 2,000 regional jobs in the beverage industry."" Keel didn’t clarify what was meant by ""regional,"" other than to say ""there are several Teamsters locals in the Philadelphia regional jurisdiction."" The Kenney administration disputes the figures as a ""doomsday scenario"" and said any job loss suffered due to the implementation of a soda tax will be offset by jobs created by the programming the tax would fund. ""If sugary drink prices go up, then consumers will choose tax-exempt beverages like bottled water and diet drinks instead,"" Kenney’s spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said. ""Small businesses will avoid job loss and maintain their profit margins by selling more tax-exempt drinks; and, accordingly, truck drivers will also be fine because they’ll be delivering more bottled water and diet soda."" Without their clarification, it’s hard to discern how the Teamsters arrived at their job loss estimate. But economists and studies suggest it’s an overshoot. Robert P. Inman, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton school, called the estimate of 2,000 job losses ""off the bounds of realistic."" About 2,000 jobs would represent nearly the entire soda bottling and delivering industry in Philadelphia, and Inman said it’s inaccurate to assume that a three-cents-per-ounce tax on soda would cause the entire industry to crumble. He said his studies show the city could see a reduction in sales in the $150 million to $200 million range. But Inman said people won’t stop buying bottled drinks. They’ll either switch to bottled beverages like water that’s also bottled and delivered by large beverage companies, or they’ll switch to smaller sized bottles that also still need to be bottled and delivered in the city. ""Wherever they’re getting the number from,"" he said, ""it is so far above anything that strikes me as plausible."" The Teamsters say they don’t buy the idea that the sale of water, diet sodas and the like will increase enough to cover the loss suffered as a result of the soda tax. In Grace’s statement, he wrote: ""Consumers simply don't react that way."" A 2014 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found a 20 percent tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (which correlates with about a two-cents-per-ounce tax) would result in small job gains. The study isn’t neutral -- it was funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthy Eating Research program. But it found that jobs lost as a result of the tax were offset by jobs created due to consumers switching to untaxed drinks like bottled water. A study published this year by Mexico’s Center for Health Systems Research found that after the country instituted a soda tax, there was a bump: Overall sales increased, largely due to higher amounts of bottled water being purchased. But then, after a year, sales fell to where they were before the tax was passed. The estimate is also higher than any other made before. When city officials floated a soda tax in 2011, the soda companies themselves predicted a job loss of 1,200 people. Al Taubenberger, a current city councilman and the former head of the Greater Northeast Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, said at the time it would cost the city 1,000 jobs. After Baltimore instituted a two-cents tax on beverage containers last year, about 75 people lost their jobs. But Inman said any job loss estimate when it comes to a soda tax is dubious. Without statistical data -- as no other place in America has instituted a three-cents-per-ounce soda tax -- it’s nearly impossible to accurately calculate predicted job loss. ""There’s been no soda tax, so you don’t have any experience who has actually seen what the effects are,"" he said. ""So you end up trying to guess, and you get into this game of ‘your guess is as good as mine.’"" Our Rating The Teamsters claim they stand to lose as many as 2,000 jobs in the region and ""countless"" others if Philadelphia implements a soda tax. This estimate is higher than any estimate floated before and tops what studies show the impact would be. And, at the end of the day, it’s nearly impossible to predict exact job loss as the result of a tax that hasn’t been implemented anywhere else in this way before. Is it within the realm of possibility that 2,000 beverage industry employees would lose their jobs due to the soda tax? Maybe. Is it likely? Not at all. We rate this claim False.","[('Email, Frank Keel. Teamsters Local 830 spokesman. May 17, 2016.', 'http://6abc.com/archive/8193830/'), ('Email, Lauren Hitt. Mayor Jim Kenney spokeswoman.

Steve Adler wrongly claims first tweet was sent from Austin
","Austin Mayor Steve Adler, making a pitch for special transportation aid, made it clear he thinks of his city as an innovation capital. In part, he said later that day, that’s because the very first tweet was launched in the city. ""Austin is where good ideas become real,"" Adler said in a May 17, 2016, morning meeting in Austin with U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. Later, Adler said during a ""smart growth"" panel discussion not involving Foxx: ""The first tweet was sent from Austin."" Austin American-Statesman technology reporter Lilly Rockwell sounded skeptical in her tweet reporting Adler’s claim to history: ""Hmm, @MayorAdler claims the first tweet was sent from Austin. I know it became popular at #SXSW but was the first tweet really sent here?"" We wondered too. To our inquiry, mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford said Adler occasionally makes his first-tweet-from-Austin claim ""as shorthand for how Twitter became real when it came to SXSW. He often says that Austin is where good ideas become real, and he likes to cite Twitter as an example, though in this case he is inexact with his word choice. The mayor has been duly and suitably reminded that words have meaning but apologizes to no one for bragging about Austin’s role as a launch pad for innovation."" Answer: #CA So, when was the first tweet? After reaching out to Twitter’s press office (not hearing back), we followed the suggestion of KUT News reporter Nathan Bernier, who’d retweeted and questioned Adler’s claim. Bernier guided us to a 2013 book by journalist Nick Bilton covering Twitter’s birth and growth, ""Hatching Twitter,"" which includes a chapter stating that one of the San Francisco-based company’s founders, Jack Dorsey, posted the first ""official"" Twitter update at 11:50 a.m. March 21, 2006. According to the book, Dorsey tweeted from the office of his then-employer, Odeo, a faltering podcast venture. Dorsey’s post said: ""just setting up my twittr,’ matching the wording of a test message someone else sent earlier. Other insiders joined in, according to the book, on what was then a crude website that like a blog, presented a stream of updates. We also noticed a ""Milestones"" section on Twitter’s website showcasing Dorsey’s groundbreaking tweet, though with a Central time zone time-stamp:  A web search led us next to a July 2006 TechCrunch story stating: ""Odeo released a new service today called Twttr, which is a sort of ‘group send’ SMS application... Each person controls their own network of friends. When any of them send a text message to ‘40404,’ all of his or her friends see the message via sms. This launched officially today, and a few select insiders were playing with the service at the Valleyschwag party in San Francisco last night."" So it looks like the first tweet was fired off in California. Austin's moment Still, the next milestone listed by Twitter says that in March 2007, ""Twitter breaks through at SXSW Interactive, wins the digital confab’s SXSW Web Award,"" and that mention includes a web link to a description of the prizewinning moment: ""Twitter won the SXSW Web Award tonight in the ‘Blog’ category. Of course everyone immediately Twittered that Twitter won, causing massive waves of SMS notifications throughout the ballroom."" The South by Southwest conference, of course, occurs in Austin. A March 2007 San Francisco Chronicle news story called Twitter the ""toast of the town"" during SXSW Interactive that year. More from that story (which indicates ""tweet"" hadn’t yet gained currency as a noun or verb): ""Large flat-panel screens at the conference had people's twitters floating by in real time. Cell phones beeped and buzzed during speeches. Groups of people stood in pockets at parties, looking down at their glowing phones and PDAs. San Francisco blogger and humorist Min Jung Kim wrote a Twitter haiku observing, ""twitter defined as/turning bunches of geeks to/14 year old girls."" ""Twitters filled up users' cell phones and wore out their batteries. ""It also gave rise to a new lingo. Among the coinages: twittermob, which, in the definition from Thor Muller of Web design firm Rubyred Labs and the forthcoming company Satisfaction, is ‘an unruly and ragtag horde of people that descend on an ill-prepared location after a provocative twitter message.’ ... ""In the words of a twitter from Scott Beale, a heavy twitterer and the head of San Francisco's Laughing Squid Web hosting service, ‘I think we reached Twittercal mass in Austin. It will be interesting to see where we go from here.’"" Our ruling Adler said the first tweet was sent from Austin. That’s not so. Twitter gained momentum during a SXSW conference in Austin, but the first tweet had been sent nearly a year earlier from California, where the company is based.

We rated that statement False, for lack of evidence. The Washington Post Fact Checker said a link did not ""appear to exist."" Fast-forward five months. Clinton says those links now do exist. ""When you say we're going to bar all Muslims, you are sending a message to the Muslim world and you're also sending a message to the terrorists because we now do have evidence,"" Clinton said May 19 on CNN. ""We have seen how Donald Trump is being used to essentially be a recruiter for more people to join the cause of terrorism."" So, has something changed? Indeed, yes. Not long after Clinton’s initial comments, Al Shabaab, the East African affiliate of the al-Qaida terrorist group, released a 51-minute video telling ""Muslims of the West"" that they are not welcome in countries like the United States. Ten minutes into the video, it says the United States has a history of ""slavery, segregation, lynching, and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps."" It then cuts to Trump calling for a temporary but ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S,"" according to SITE Intelligence Group, which studies jihadist propaganda, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. It urges American Muslims to leave the United States and join the group. Later, on March 24, Newsweek reported that an ISIS video released in the wake of the Brussels attack featured an audio clip from Trump. ""Brussels was one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities of the world 20 years ago. It was amazing, actually, and safe. And now it's a horror show. It's an absolute horror show,"" Trump says in the video, as ISIS lets the phrase ""absolute horror show"" repeatedly echo and fade. Clinton's initial statement in December ""was false at the time,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""It’s true now."" Trump's comment in the Brussels video may not seem inflammatory, he said, yet ""if you game it out from the perspective of, say, ISIS and they think Donald Trump is a great recruiting tool, then probably they don't want to play him up too much before the election because they'd want him to win."" There may be other videos, Gartenstein-Ross said. ""Unlike in the past when you had multiple analysts watch every al-Qaida release, ISIS's video production operation is so large, it's really hard for people to watch every single ISIS release because they release so much. They're extraordinarily prolific. I would wager there are other uses of him in their propaganda."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""We now do have evidence. We have seen how Donald Trump is being used to essentially be a recruiter for more people to join the cause of terrorism."" That wasn't the case the first time Clinton claimed this. But now two different terror groups have used Trump's words in propaganda videos.

Dairy exporters say WHO casts milk as 'an obstacle' to toddler health
","The milk industry is upset with the World Health Organization, claiming the international group is pushing a set of marketing guidelines that put their products in a bad light. In a letter to President Barack Obama on May 9, 2016, the U.S. Dairy Export Council wrote that a WHO proposal ""portrays milk and dairy products as an obstacle to a healthy start in life."" Does WHO think that milk and dairy products don’t do a baby’s body good? Proposed marketing guidelines At issue are proposed guidelines from the World Health Organization due for a vote at the World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, at the end of May. The document has been in the works for years and its stated purpose is to end ""the inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children, with the aim to promote, protect and support breastfeeding, prevent obesity,"" and generally promote a healthy diet. Dairy exporters are not against breastfeeding, said Shawna Morris, vice president of trade policy for the U.S. Dairy Export Council. The problem, Morris said, is that the WHO proposal covers toddlers up to 3 years old. ""If we have images of a 1- or 2-year-old drinking milk, is that prohibited?"" Morris said. ""It seems to us that it would be."" Morris highlighted several troublesome clauses in the WHO document, including this one (emphasis ours): ""Products that function as breast-milk substitutes should not be promoted. A breast-milk substitute should be understood to include any milks (or products that could be used to replace milk, such as fortified soy milk), in either liquid or powdered form, that are specifically marketed for feeding infants and young children up to the age of 3 years (including follow-up formula and growing-up milks). As the trade groups see it, the proposal would go further. Yogurt, milk and cheese would fall under this definition, they say, when guidelines from the medical community say that most young children do just fine with these foods. Charles Taylor, a marketing professor at Villanova University’s School of Business, told us that the dairy industry has a point. He calls the document ""draconian."" ""At best, the WHO guidelines are a one-sided argument in favor of their strongly held position that breastfeeding is healthier for children without giving the whole position,"" Taylor said. "" At worst, they can be viewed as providing consumers with incomplete information on milk."" How WHO responds Make no mistake, WHO doesn’t want to see breast-milk substitutes promoted. WHO contends, however, that the dairy industry is reading too much into the proposed marketing rules. The proposal says you can identify what products would be affected by how they’re pitched to the public. If they are ""specifically marketed for feeding infants and young children up to the age of 3 years,"" then they are a breast-milk substitute. WHO officials says that excludes milk products such as yogurt, milk and cheese. WHO spokeswoman Olivia Lawe-Davies said that ""in no way does the guidance discourage the consumption of milk. In fact, WHO recommends milk consumption for older infants and young children who are not being breastfed."" That jibes with current WHO guidelines for non-breastfed children age 2 and under. The guidelines state, ""Milk products are rich sources of calcium and several other nutrients. Diets that do not contain animal source foods (meat, poultry, fish or eggs, plus milk products) cannot meet all nutrient needs at this age."" Davies said the new proposal simply adds marketing restrictions for products known as ""follow-up formula"" and ""growing-up milks."" Both are similar to infant formula, but the first one is aimed at infants from 6 months to 1 year, and the second is for toddlers up to 3 years. ""Milks marketed for infants and young children are breast-milk substitutes because they de facto displace the intake of breast milk,"" Davies said. ""Milk that is marketed as a general family food is not covered by this recommendation since it is not marketed specifically for feeding of infants and young children."" Reading between the lines Experts who have studied the language and are aware of both arguments say both the dairy industry and the World Health Organization have a point. Allyn Taylor has a special expertise in the legal ins and outs of these global health codes. Taylor, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law, was a senior legal adviser when the WHO crafted its rules on tobacco control. She has had no involvement with the latest guidelines. Taylor criticizes the current text as ambiguous, ""poorly written"" and subject to interpretation. Taylor told us she hopes the wording will be debated at the upcoming World Health Assembly in Geneva. (Perhaps in a way to settle this dispute.) But even with that, she said to assert that the proposal casts milk as an obstacle goes too far. ""That is quite a pejorative claim,"" Taylor said. ""You will not find any words in this document to that effect."" Another law professor, Emily Parento at the McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, Calif., agreed. The text of the proposal could be more tightly written, she said. But she didn’t see how that flaw gets you to the industry line that WHO is against milk products for toddlers. ""I can’t see the WHO not wanting little kids eating string cheese or having a cup of plain milk,"" Parento said. ""That’s just not there."" A key industry trend The world of powdered milk mixes has changed a lot since the current breast-milk formula marketing guidelines passed in 1981. Formula makers began targeting older infants and toddlers. A report from a New Zealand business group said the expansion produced a $55 billion a year market. In a nod to the impact of the 1981 WHO marketing guidelines, the report noted ""Infant formula is typically defined as ""birth to six months""; the product is then renamed for a range of reasons (primarily to avoid regulation and restrictions on advertising)."" Our ruling The U.S. Dairy Export Council said a WHO proposal ""wrongly portrays milk and dairy products as an obstacle to a healthy start in life."" The proposal clearly is targeting some dairy products, specifically powdered formulations, as ones that work against the benefits that come from maintaining breastfeeding through a child’s early years. But the dairy industry is making a much broader claim, saying the proposal targets milk and dairy products generally. That’s at best unclear. It’s likely unfounded, experts told us. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/19fba549-5c0e-49d6-9345-12daccfef3dc","[('U.S. Dairy Export Council, White House Asked to Challenge WHO Proposal Discouraging Dairy for Children up to Age 3, May 9, 2016', 'http://www.usdec.org/newsroom/news-releases/news-releases/news-release-05/09/2016'), ('U.S. Dairy Export Council, National Milk Producers Federation and International Dairy Foods Association, Letter to President Barack Obama, May 9, 2016', 'No link'), ('World Health Organization, Guidance on Ending the Inappropriate Promotion of Foods for Infants and Young Children, May 16, 2016', 'http://www.nmpf.org/files/WHO%20Proposal%20WH%20lettter%20050916.pdf'), ('World Health Organization, Guiding principles for feeding non-breastfed children 6-24 months of age, 2005', 'No link'), ('Agricultural Resource Marketing Center, International Dairy Profile, accessed May 17, 2016', 'http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA69/A69_7Add1-en.pdf'), ('Coriolis, Infant formula value chain, January 2014', 'No link'), (""ForBaby, Choosing a formula for your baby's stage: 1, 2 or 3?, accessed May 17, 2016"", 'http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43281/1/9241593431.pdf?ua=1&ua=1'), ('Lancet, Maternal and child undernutrition and overweight in low-income and middle-income countries, Aug. 3, 2013', 'No link'), ('Maternal and Child Nutrition, Cross-sectional survey shows that follow-up formula and growing-up milks are labelled similarly to infant formula in four low and middle income countries, April 7, 2016', 'http://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/livestock/dairy/international-dairy-profile/'), ('Dairy Reporter, US dairy exporters have ‘huge’ opportunity to tap world market for medical nutrition: USDEC, April 11, 2012', 'No link'), ('World Health Organization, International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, 1981', 'http://www.coriolisresearch.com/pdfs/Coriolis_Infant_Formula_Value_Chain_2014.pdf'), ('Food and Nutrition Bulletin, Childhood dual burden of under- and over-nutrition in low- and middle-income countries: a critical review, \xa0June 2014', 'No link'), ('Food and Agriculture Organization, Proposed Draft Revision of the Guidelines on Formulated Supplementary Foods for Older Infants and Young Children, September 2010', 'http://www.forbaby.co.nz/Stage-1/Formula-Feeding/Choosing-a-formula-for-your-baby-s-stage-1-2-or-3#'), ('Interview, Shawna Morris, vice president of trade policy, U.S. Dairy Export Council, May 17, 2016', 'No link'), ('Interview, Allyn L.

Hillary Clinton says 2015 was the best year in US auto industry history
","On the campaign trail, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has pitched herself as someone who will continue many of President Barack Obama’s policies. At a campaign rally in Kentucky May 16, Clinton praised the 2009 auto industry bailout, which people view as an Obama success. ""We saved the auto industry,"" she said. ""That’s important in Louisville. It’s important in Bowling Green. It’s important in Northern Kentucky. It’s important across this commonwealth. That’s a big difference between me and my opponent in the primary. I voted to save the auto industry, he voted not to. It’s important to know that it was the right vote because we just had the best year for the auto industry in America in history."" We’ve already looked into how Clinton’s primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, voted on the auto bailout, which totaled an estimated $85 billion. But we were also curious about Clinton’s claim that 2015 was ""the best year for the auto industry in America in history."" This is true by one big measure: Americans bought more cars and trucks in 2015 than ever before. But that success might mask long-term issues with American manufacturers, especially given foreign manufacturers’ growing market share. In 2015, Americans bought more than 17.5 million cars. The last peak was 17.3 million in 2000, followed by a collapse to 10.4 million at the height of the recession in 2009. Additionally, the past six years have been the longest period of sustained year-over-year growth in auto sales since the 1920s, according to Auto Alliance, a vehicle manufacturer association. Vehicle sales wax and wane with the economy. Wards Auto, an analytics organization, has tracked vehicle sales since 1963.  When times are tough, vehicles become a discretionary purchase that consumers are willing to put off. Analysts believe car sales have done so well in the past couple of years because of a combination of the improving economy, cheap gas prices, available credit and low interest rates for loans. Experts we asked agreed with Clinton’s claim, saying the sales figures are a reasonable way to measure the auto industry’s health. ""She's right,"" said Bruce Belzowski, managing director of the automotive futures group at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. ""By any objective measure, the auto industry bailout is an Obama success story."" The Detroit Three big automakers — Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler — reported strong sales in 2015 and projections for 2016. But it’s worth remembering that the record-breaking total vehicle sales figure isn’t just for American-made cars. It includes foreign models sold in the United States, too. Of the 2.4 million cars sold so far in 2016, 71 percent were imports, according to the Wall Street Journal. David Lewis, a professor emeritus of business history at the University of Michigan, compared 2015 to the golden age of the American car industry. ""Think of 1955, a record sales year, and a time in which well over 90 percent of the vehicles sold in the U.S. were manufactured by American companies,"" Lewis said. Even taking into account the number of foreign versus American car purchases, Clinton’s claim is reasonable because foreign car sales count as part of the ""auto industry,"" said Clifford Winston, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. Foreign cars have been a growing part of the U.S. auto market since the 1980s. But it might not be fair to take her claim as proof of the long-term health of American manufacturers, Winston said. While the bailout resurrected struggling American auto manufacturers, it’s possible that it just stalled the companies’ eventual decline as consumers choose foreign cars instead. He also noted potential future threats from ride-sharing services and self-driving cars. ""Let us not get too excited about one or even a few years of successes with this industry that has been extremely turbulent and repeatedly rescued by the government,"" Winston said. ""All the while, the Detroit share has gone down. So that tells you something that any given year still may mask long-term issues."" This is partially reflected in employment data. Employment among car dealers has in fact returned to its pre-recession high of about 1.2 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But employment in the motor vehicle and parts manufacturing sector hasn’t completely recovered. About 1.3 million people worked in this sector in the early 2000s; that figure dropped to about 620,000 at the height of the recession in 2009, and it has risen to about 920,000 in early 2016. But ""for the factories that made it out of the recession, all is well,"" Belzowski said. U.S. vehicle production in 2015 was the eighth-largest in history, at 11.9 million. That’s high — and almost double production in 2009 — but still not quite as high as it was in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Some industry analysts expect the good times to keep coming for the next few years, with 2016 breaking more records, according to the Detroit Free Press. ""It’s a great time to be in the automobile business, and it’s particularly sweet for those who lived through the dark days of 2009 and 2010,"" said IHS Automotive analyst Tom Libby. Our ruling Clinton said, ""We just had the best year for the auto industry in America in history."" With sales figures that exceed the pre-recession high, 2015 was a great year for the auto industry, including American manufacturers. This high point should be taken with a grain of salt because it might mask long-term issues with American manufacturers, especially given foreign manufacturers’ growing market share. Clinton’s statement is nearly accurate but requires that extra bit of context, so we rate it Mostly True.","[('Wards Auto, ""U.S. Car and Truck Sales, 1931-2015,"" Jan. 22, 2016', 'http://wardsauto.com/datasheet/us-car-and-truck-sales-1931-2014'), ('Auto Alliance, Sales Data, accessed May 20, 2016', 'No link'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""Automotive Industry: Employment, Earnings, and Hours,"" May 18, 2016', 'http://www.autoalliance.org/auto-marketplace/sales-data'), ('Car and Driver, ""Boom!

Justice Don Willett accurately recaps surge in Texas students meeting college readiness standards
","Deep in the May 2016 Texas Supreme Court ruling that upheld and critiqued the current school funding system is encouraging news about the performance of Texas students. On Page 58 of the majority opinion, Justice Don Willett (who subsequently showed up among individuals that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he’d consider to succeed Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court) refers to a November 2005 decision by the court that required lawmakers to change the system. At the time of the West Orange-Cove II ruling, Willett writes, ""the percentage of students meeting the college-readiness standards of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board stood at 28% in English and 42% in math. Those figures stood at 65% and 66% in 2013,"" Willett continues. Did Texas high school graduates get so much more college-primed that fast? Best we could tell, the cited figures track with state test results tracked by the Texas Education Agency. Then again, as few as 26 percent of Texas high-school graduates lately show a readiness for college according to a couple of other respected metrics. Texas Success Initiative With help from Texas Education Agency officials, we found figures very close to what Willett presents in the 2016 majority opinion. According to the agency, in 2004, 29 percent of students fulfilled college readiness standards for English language arts and 43 percent did so for math while in 2013, 65 percent of students met readiness standards for English, 66 percent for math. With rare exception, according to the agency, the percentage of students fulfilling each readiness standard escalated steadily through the intervening years. And most recently, in 2014, 68 percent of students met the English readiness standards with 67 percent doing so in math, the agency says. We wondered what the percentages meant. They reflect student test results, TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson advised, in keeping with a state law that requires college and universities to assess incoming high school graduates for their readiness to take college courses and offer remedial instruction as needed. Under the program, called the Texas Success Initiative, the TEA has reported on the readiness of high-school students by calculating the share of students who meet related expectations on the state-mandated English language arts and math 11th grade/exit-level Texas Assessment of Knowledge & Skills. Asked if perhaps standards loosened between 2004 and 2013, Culbertson pointed out by email that in each of the years, a student classified as ready for college needed ""scale scores of 2200"" on each relevant TAKS including a 3 (out of a possible 4) on the writing portion of the English test. To our inquiry, Shannon Housson, TEA director of performance reporting, said by phone the 124 percent and 54 percent respective improvements in students meeting the readiness standards over nine years reflected schools and students adjusting to and, in some cases, mastering the English and math TAKS, which were given from 2003 through 2011 before yielding to the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness. At its inception, Housson said, the TAKS added up to a ""significant increase in rigor"" for students accustomed to the previous state-mandated exams. ""I remember the angst in the schools,"" Housson said, as teachers and others came to terms with the new focus on ""higher-order thinking skills"" linked to the state-set curriculum rather than simply academic skills. Finally, Willett’s citation of the 2005 court decision on school finance led us to look back at how that opinion by Justice Nathan Hecht presented the percentages of students meeting the readiness standards. In the ruling, Hecht showed results for all students plus break-outs suggesting considerable performance lags among African American, Hispanic and Limited English Proficient students. Results for 2013 suggest such gaps have closed quite a bit except among students the state deems English Language Learners. Texas Students With Test Scores Suggesting College Readiness, 2004 and 2013 Subject All Students African-American Hispanic White LEP/ELL* English (2004) 29% 19% 20% 36% 3% Math (2004) 43% 21% 29% 56% 13% English (2013) 65% 55% 60% 74% 14% Math (2013) 61% 51% 55% 71% 12% *Limited English Proficient/English Language Learners SAT, ACT scores There are other ways to gauge college readiness. In 2014, nearly 34 percent of the state’s students who took the pre-college SAT (or 32 percent of public school students taking the test) did well enough to demonstrate a readiness for college work without remediation, according to the College Board, which associates an SAT score of 1550 out of 2400 with a 65 percent probability of obtaining a first-year college GPA of B- or higher. The same year, among 60 percent of 116,147 Texas high school graduates to take the ACT scored well enough to show a readiness for college English, the Iowa-based group says, with 47 percent doing so in math and 36 percent demonstrating readiness in science--and only 26 percent clearing all the tests’ college-readiness benchmarks. ACT says its readiness benchmarks are ""scores on the ACT subject-area tests that represent the level of achievement required for students to have a 50% chance of obtaining a B or higher or about a 75% chance of obtaining a C or higher in corresponding credit-bearing first-year college courses."" Our ruling Willett, writing for the court majority, said that before 2005, ""the percentage of"" Texas high-school students meeting the coordinating board’s college readiness standards ""stood at 28% in English and 42% in math. Those figures stood at 65% and 66% in 2013."" This statement doesn’t acknowledge readiness metrics such as ACT or SAT scores. But it almost perfectly reflects the state’s tallies of high school graduates in 2004 and 2013 who scored high enough on state English and math tests to be considered college-ready.

""I have had to fill out FEC reports for the past six years now, and they’re much more detailed than a tax return..."" Marino said in an effort to defend Trump in a recent interview on MSNBC. Federal Election Commission reports and tax filings can puzzle even the wonkiest of political observers. So out of these two tedious documents, which one is more detailed? And are they even worth comparing? Asked about why the congressman considers FEC filings to be more detailed, Marino’s communications director, Ainsley Holyfield, did not provide a clear answer. She described the length of Trump’s FEC filing -- 92 pages -- and added that there was no law requiring candidates to file tax returns. ""We do believe these are comparable as they are both gathering in-depth financial information related to a person or entity,"" she said. ""If the intent is to understand a person’s financial status, the same information can be gathered from both documents.""   Assets versus income Presidential candidates are required to disclose all of their assets with the FEC. In July 2015, Trump released a 92-page personal financial disclosure report, or FEC report, that listed all of his assets. Although the PFD contains details about all of Trump’s assets, it does not necessarily contain accurate information about the value of each asset. For example, the report lists the value of the Philadelphia branch of Trump National Golf Club as somewhere between ""$5,000,001 - $25,000,000."" Furthermore, a PFD is not audited. There is no government agency that validates the accuracy of presidential PFDs, so it is up to the candidate to accurately assess the value and income earned from each asset. A tax return, experts say, serves a different purpose. A tax return, which is audited, requires precise numbers for each income-earning asset. It does not include assets that do not earn an income, but contains numbers for the assets that it does list, not broad ranges like ""$5,000,001 - $25,000,000."" Brett Kappel, a partner with Akerman LLP and an election lawyer with over 25 years of experience, argues that the two documents are different by design. ""The personal financial disclosure report is designed to disclose potential financial conflicts of interest, so it requires much greater disclosure of assets than a tax return."" said Kappel. ""A tax return is designed to capture income, so it contains much more information about income derived from assets."" In other words, a tax return reflects how much income a person makes from their assets, and an FEC filing contains how many assets a person has.   But which is more detailed? To begin answering this question, we asked Kappel if any significant information could be found in Donald Trump’s tax returns that is not present in his FEC report. In recent news, Trump has refused to release his tax returns, arguing that ""there’s nothing to learn from them."" Kappel said at least three things could be learned from a tax return: ""actual income, charitable contributions and use of offshore accounts to hold and/or shelter income."" A tax return will not reveal information like Trump’s net worth, but it will show his annual income and his charitable contributions. Much of Trump’s campaign is built around his image as a successful and generous businessman. A tax return would contain information that could either validate or discredit this image. On Feb. 25, Trump tweeted a picture of him signing what he called a recent tax return. The stack of tax return papers rises far above Trump’s head while he is sitting at his desk. In a recent interview with Fox News, Trump said the picture he gave had ""about 2 1/2 feet of tax returns standing in front of [him]."" On the other hand, Trump’s PFD on the Federal Election Commission’s website spans 92 pages. David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-winning tax expert, believes that a tax return is more detailed than the form the FEC requires presidential candidates to fill out.   ""Look at the online photo of Trump next to what he says is his tax return"" said Johnston. ""Then get the FEC form, which runs far less than one ream of paper."" Trump’s recent tax return seems to span significantly more pages than his PFD, but according to Johnston that’s not the biggest problem with Marino’s comparison. ""The point,"" he said, ""is that Rep. Marino is mixing oranges with horse apples."" Our ruling Tom Marino said that a presidential FEC report is much more detailed than a tax return. The primary purpose of an FEC report is to list assets. A tax return provides detailed information about each income-earning asset. It may not list all of the filer’s assets -- as an FEC report would -- but it requires accurate income calculations for the assets that actually produce income. Also, an FEC report is not audited. Given the differences in the two types of forms, a comparison between the two is irrelevant, and experts say a tax return requires more exact measures of how much a person makes.   We rate this claim False.","[('Youtube, ""Rep.

NRCC wrongly says Jacky Rosen 'refused' to say if she supports Sanders or Clinton. She's pro-Clinton
","Republicans are hoping to tie the increasingly fraught battle between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination to down-ballot Democrats. That’s the case in Nevada, where the National Republican Congressional Committee is running automated telephone calls telling voters that Democratic candidate Jacky Rosen hasn’t committed to supporting either Sanders or Clinton. ""Jacky Rosen has refused to tell us whether she supports Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton,"" the recorded call says. So has Rosen, a synagogue leader who was recruited by Sen. Harry Reid to run for the state’s 3rd Congressional District, refused to weigh in on the presidential race? In a word — no. Rosen, who announced her candidacy in January, told Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston on May 12 that she caucused for Clinton back in February. ""I caucused for Hillary, and it looks like she’s going to be the nominee, and I’m proud to stand on the ticket with her,"" she told Ralston. (This comment starts at 20:30.) NRCC spokesman Zach Hunter said in an email that there was a difference between caucusing and endorsing, and that Rosen has generally been dodgy on the issue. ""In 2016 when you have such a divide in the Democratic party as it barrels towards a contested convention, the difference is significant,"" he said in an email. It’s true that Rosen has done few media interviews since announcing her candidacy, but it doesn’t appear that she’s really been asked about who she’s endorsed for president. Articles in the Laughlin Nevada Times and Las Vegas Sun don’t mention a presidential endorsement from Rosen. Associated Press political reporter Michelle Rindels interviewed Rosen on April 27 for an upcoming story and confirmed that the candidate openly supported Clinton. It is curious as to why Rosen didn’t speak up about her presidential preference before Nevada’s presidential caucus in February, despite announcing her candidacy back in January. The Clinton campaign in the state didn’t appear to tout her endorsement, and she doesn’t appear on a campaign list of ""100 Nevada women for Hillary"" from November 2015. But her endorsement of Clinton on Ralston Live was straightforward. ""She spent eight years in the White House, she was a senator, she’s traveled all around the world talking to world leaders,"" she said. ""And she’s a mom and a grandma and I really think she has a lifelong experience in doing this, having a calm, cool, collected head, being analytical and those are the kind of things that are important to me."" Our ruling The NRCC says Democrat Jacky Rosen ""has refused to tell us whether she supports Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton.""

Top 0.1% would be big winner under Donald Trump's tax plan, Wisconsin Hillary Clinton supporter says
","For being Hillary Clinton surrogates, two Wisconsin lawmakers sounded rather like Bernie Sanders when they got on the phone with reporters to denounce Donald Trump’s tax plan. ""For the billionaires, by the billionaires,"" state Rep. Cory Mason of Racine declared in the May 11, 2016 teleconference, which was arranged by Clinton’s Wisconsin campaign. Mason was joined by fellow Democrat Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse, the Senate minority leader. Her attack was more specific. Shilling stated that with Trump’s plan, ""the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- people earning multiple millions of dollars a year, on average -- would get more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers combined."" Economic inequality has been a signature issue for Sanders, whose presidential campaign has kept Clinton from claiming the presumptive nominee title Trump has on the Republican side. When Sanders said in Madison that the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, we rated his claim Mostly True  . Let's take a look at Shilling’s one-tenth of 1 percenters claim -- which, as we’ll see, was made at something of a moving target. The figures Standing in the lobby of Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan in September 2015, Trump rolled out his tax reform plan -- which some analysts immediately saw as a boon for the wealthy. He proposed significant cuts across the board, PolitiFact National found, but the wealthiest would get the most in tax cuts. For the highest income earners, the top income tax rate would drop from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. When we asked about Shilling’s claim, Clinton’s Wisconsin campaign cited an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of two Washington, D.C. think tanks: the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. The analysis found that on average, under Trump’s plan, households at all income levels would receive tax cuts -- but the highest-income households would receive the largest cuts, both in dollars and as a percentage of income. More specific to Shilling’s claim: The highest-income 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- those who had an income of over $3.7 million in 2015 -- would get an average tax cut of more than $1.3 million in 2017. That same group would receive 18 percent of the tax reduction, while the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers would receive 16.4 percent of the reduction. At our request, the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice also did calculations, which came out nearly the same: The top 0.1 percent would get 17 percent of Trump's proposed tax cuts and the bottom 60 percent would get 13 percent of the cuts. To some extent, this isn’t a surprise, in that the wealthiest pay the lion’s share of income taxes. In a June 2015 report, the Tax Policy Center said the top 0.1 percent pay 21.1 percent of all individual income taxes and the bottom 60 percent pays 1.5 percent. Alan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation, also ran the numbers and told us Shilling’s claim is accurate. But Cole noted that under Trump’s plan: -- People in the 40th to 60th percentiles have about 99 percent of their income tax liability removed. -- People in the 0 to 40th percentiles who paid positive income taxes have about 100 percent of their income tax liability removed. ""So the reason Trump’s plan doesn’t cut middle-class income taxes by more than that is, well, you can’t cut middle-class income taxes by more than that,"" Cole said.   So, the figures back Shilling. The thing is, shortly before she made her claim, Trump’s tax proposal was changing. Sort of. Maybe. Or was it? Trump’s equivocation In the three days prior, Trump said he might raise, not lower, taxes on the wealthy. Then he indicated the wealthy would get tax cuts, but the cuts might be less than what is in his plan. And then Politico reported that Trump’s campaign had enlisted conservative economists to revise his plan, and that they were advising a top tax rate of 28 percent -- higher than the 25 percent in Trump’s proposal. All of which has caused some confusion as to what Trump would do with taxes. Nevertheless, by the time Shilling made her statement, Trump had not changed his tax proposal, which remained on his campaign website. (Indeed, for what it's worth, the day after Shilling’s claim, a Trump spokeswoman told the New York Times: ""There are no changes being made to the plan."") Our rating Shilling said that under Trump's tax plan, ""the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- people earning multiple millions of dollars a year, on average --  would get more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers combined."" A report from a respected nonpartisan research group calculates that the 0.1 percent -- those making more than $3.7 million per year -- would receive 18 percent of the tax cuts under Trump’s proposal. The bottom 60 percent of taxpayers, meanwhile, would enjoy only 16.4 percent of the cuts. Another tax group found similar figures. Trump has indicated he might make alter his tax proposal, but he hadn’t as of when Shilling made her statement -- so we rate the statement True.

Medical marijuana dispensaries will outnumber Walmarts and Walgreens in Florida, anti-pot group says
","Opponents of Florida’s medical marijuana amendment have fired up a new round of attacks, claiming there will be a dispensary on practically every corner if voters approve the initiative. In a three-minute ad released May 16, 2016, the group Vote No On 2 calls Amendment 2 ""a scam to legalize pot."" Should the measure pass, they say, it’s likely that places to buy medical marijuana will outnumber two well-known retail outlets. ""Looks like Amendment 2 will put almost 2,000 pot shops in Florida ... more pot shops than Walmart and Walgreens combined,"" the video says. It goes on to deride California medical marijuana regulations and users, and implies Florida would become like the Golden State if the measure passes. While polls say medical marijuana is enjoying about 80 percent support among voters, Vote No On 2’s figures spark an interesting point. Would the number of medical marijuana dispensaries outnumber Walmarts and Walgreens locations in Florida? That's possible, according to one state estimate, but the figures are a little hazy. Dispensary data Amendment 2 was first on the ballot in 2014 but narrowly lost the 60 percent required to pass. The current version for the November 2016 ballot has the same name, but United for Care, the group behind the measure, altered the language to address some concerns that hounded the 2014 amendment. The amendment now requires parental consent and doctor certification for minors and more clearly defines the medical conditions it covers: cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis ""or other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated,"" with a doctor’s recommendation. It works like this: If a patient with one of these conditions gets the okay from a doctor, they (or a certified caregiver) will get a state-issued ID card and be able to go to a state-regulated dispensary to buy their marijuana. Doctors technically can’t prescribe marijuana because it is still a Schedule I drug under federal law, meaning it’s considered highly addictive and has no known medical benefits, and is therefore illegal. Doctors would risk losing their ability to practice medicine. Pharmacies also can’t legally distribute cannabis, making dispensaries necessary. So how many dispensaries would there be? The proposed amendment leaves the details of medical marijuana regulations up to the Legislature and the Florida Health Department. Legislators would need to pass a bill for medical marijuana and the health department would develop and enforce regulations. In essence, there could be as few or as many dispensaries as the state wants.   There’s only one estimate for how many patients and dispensaries there would be — a 2015 health department analysis. That report used Florida Department of Economic and Demographic Research data to estimate 440,552 patients in Florida would qualify for medical cannabis. The amendment would lead to 1,993 registered treatment centers, the health department said. That’s the figure Vote No On 2 is using in its ad. United for Care doesn’t dispute the figures, because the health department’s analysis is the only study that’s been done. ""It’s the best educated guess that we have,"" United for Care director Ben Pollara said. ""It’s up to the Department of Health and the Legislature. … It could be 2,000, it could be 20. It could be 5,000."" In any event, 1,993 dispensaries would outnumber all the Walmarts and Walgreens in Florida. Vote No On 2 spokeswoman Christina Johnson said the group chose those businesses to illustrate how ubiquitous dispensaries would be should the amendment pass. The video correctly shows 840 Walgreens drug stores in the state, but includes 191 Walmarts, a figure apparently derived from a January 2007 list from Reclaim Democracy, a group seeking limits on corporate influence in government. A more recent list from Walmart shows 223 supercenters and 10 discount stores. (Neighborhood Markets and Sam’s Club stores are not included in either count.) While Walmart and Walgreens do have pharmacies, we’re not convinced pitting small medical cannabis dispensaries against big chain retailers is a fair comparison. It may be better to compare so-called ""pot shops"" to the overall number of pharmacies. The state health department told us there are 9,725 licensed pharmacies in Florida. To provide more context for the dispensary estimate, we will note that the state Department of Business and Professional Regulation says Florida has 2,082 active licensed veterinary clinics — and 1,893 package liquor stores. Mile-high estimate With so little spelled out in the proposed amendment, we wondered how the health department arrived at its estimate of 1,993 dispensaries. The health department told us they used Colorado, with about 5.3 million people, for the analysis because the state has allowed medical cannabis for years and has a broad baseline of data. The report says there are 515 licensed medical marijuana centers as of October 2015 (there are 528 now, according to the Colorado Department of Revenue) serving almost 114,000 patients. Analysts then scaled that up to Florida’s population of 20 million. Karen O’Keefe, director of state policies and the pro-legislation Marijuana Policy Project, said of the 24 states and the District of Columbia allowing medical marijuana, it’s misleading to use either Colorado or California as examples for Florida. Not only did Colorado decriminalize recreational marijuana use in 2012 — its 421 retail shops are counted separately from medical dispensaries — but both states lacked the kind of initial regulatory oversight Amendment 2 would require. ""California dispensaries still have no state licensing or regulation to speak of, though a regulatory and licensing law should be phased in by 2018,"" O’Keefe said in an email. ""In Colorado, regulations went into effect in 2010-11, but hundreds of dispensaries pre-dated them."" A better state to look to would be New Mexico, O’Keefe said, because it required a licensing program in its law when it passed. New Mexico had 23 dispensaries for its 2 million residents, and expanded that to 35 in 2015. Extrapolating Florida’s total based on New Mexico’s regulations would net far fewer dispensaries, O’Keefe said. If it were based on total land area, Florida could limit the number to about 16. If there were the same number of dispensaries per capita as New Mexico, there could be about 340. ""I really can’t say how many are likely, since it will depend on many factors, with the primary one being regulations. But I would bet it’s far less than 2,000,"" O’Keefe said. Our ruling Vote No On 2 said, ""Amendment 2 will put almost 2,000 pot shops in Florida ... more pot shops than Walmart and Walgreens combined."" The state health department did project 1,993 medical marijuana dispensaries would be needed to serve potential patients, based on data from Colorado compared with Florida. That is more than the 840 Walgreens and 233 Walmart supercenters and discount stores in the state, although the comparison seems like a bit of a red herring. It’s important to remember that while the health department report is the only real estimate available, this figure isn’t definite. The agency and the Legislature would decide the actual number of stores and how they are regulated after the amendment passes. That total is anyone’s guess. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

He can’t.) To the stat sheet! Bolt currently holds both the 100 meter and 200 meter world records at 9.58 seconds and 19.19 seconds respectively. That corresponds to 23.35 miles per hour for the 100-meter dash, and 23.31 miles per hour for the 200-meter dash. Based on how he’s performed in all past races listed by the International Association of Athletics Federations, Bolt’s average speed is 21.65 miles per hour. Even at his slowest, when he clocked 48.28 seconds at the 400-meter in 2001, he was still running at 18.53 miles per hour. The New York Times did an excellent job breaking down Bolt’s prowess in this video from the 2012 Olympics.  So Bolt runs — in short bursts — around 22 miles per hour. How does that stack up against mosquitoes? Many mosquito species in the Aedes genus (africanus, apicoargenteus, luteocephalus, vitattus, furcifer, albopictus, hensilli and polynesiensis) can transmit the Zika virus, but the main vector is Aedes aegypti. Female aegypti mosquitoes (the ones that bite) are estimated to have a cruising speed of 0.5 to 1.5 meters per second. That’s the equivalent of 1.12 to 3.35 miles per hour — a fraction of Bolt’s speed, even at his slowest. In that sense, it’s not a contest. Until you factor in stamina. Bolt runs short distances, while the mosquitoes are in it for the long haul. Researchers have documented lady aegypti flying continuously for two to nine hours, with an average of 2.2 hours. So Bolt, or really anyone, would have to run more than 7.37 miles in that time frame to outpace the mosquito. Kenya’s Dennis Kimetto, Bolt’s world record counterpart in the marathon world, ran 26.219 miles in 2 hours, 2 minutes and 57 seconds. He’d leave the mosquito nearly 20 miles behind with that pace.  Kimetto. (AP) Bolt and Kimetto would have a lot more to worry about if the Zika vector was a desert locust or earworm, which have respective average air speeds of 21 and 17 miles per hour. But for now, Zika-carrying mosquitoes can’t catch up to either man. Our ruling Bolt said Zika mosquitoes ""can’t catch me."" The Olympic champion and world record holder clocks an average speed is 21.65 miles per hour in his races, with 23.35 miles per hour at the high end and 18.53 miles per hour at the low end. Female A. aegypti mosquitoes, the main vector for Zika, cruise between 1.12 and 3.35 miles per hour. That’s a lot slower than Bolt, though the mosquitoes fly for much longer than Bolt sprints. Don’t try this, people. (But if you do, send us a video!)

Ted Strickland says trade deals done in 'secret' and without union input
","In Ohio’s rancorous contest for the Senate seat currently held by Republican Rob Portman, the Democratic opponent, Ted Strickland, has regularly invoked the candidates’ stances on trade. He frequently calls Portman ""the best senator China’s ever had."" But at a campaign stop at a steelworkers’ union hall in Lorain, Ohio, Strickland said something we hadn’t heard before. ""We need to stop politicians and special interests from negotiating trade deals in secret,"" Strickland said. ""Now, I don’t know exactly how these trade deals are negotiated, but that’s a problem. The American people ought to know who’s in the room and who has some input. I do know that they consult with the corporate leaders. To my knowledge they’ve never invited the leaders of the AFL-CIO or steelworkers or the mine workers to come in and sit down in these meetings."" Secret? And without union input? Our fact-checking curiosity piqued, we decided to dive in. Negotiated in secret PolitiFact has previously explored the biggest pending trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Five years in the making, the TPP sets new rules for trade between the United States and Pacific nations (not including China). The Senate voted to fast-track this trade deal in June 2015, meaning that legislators can’t amend the agreement hammered out by the White House. They can only vote for it or against it. But were the negotiations secret? We checked in with former U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab, now a professor at the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland. She told us, basically, yes. ""What you don’t want, or need, in a negotiation -- unless you intentionally want to blow it up or undermine your own side’s position -- is for the other side to know what your real motivation is, or what your bottom lines are,"" Schwab said. Because the TPP deal involves an incredible number of interested parties, the need to not let other partners know what terms each side has ""won"" in negotiations is essential, Schwab said. ""Why would you want that?"" she continued. ""Then it isn’t a negotiation at all. You may as well give it all away and not expect to get anything back for American interests. That includes workers’ interests, manufacturing interests, agricultural interests, etc.""   But who’s in this clandestine club at the bargaining table? That brings us to our next question. Unions role in trade negotiations Schwab told us that union reps have the same access as corporate interests in trade negotiations. She knows because she was there. ""I used to meet regularly with John Sweeney, when he was head of the AFL-CIO, along with his lead trade advisor at the time, Thea Lee, because they were on our official advisory committee for all of the negotiations we were involved in,"" Schwab said. There are well over 1,000 ""cleared advisors"" engaged in the trade negotiations process, Schwab said, in private sector advisory committees. While negotiations are ongoing, those advisors are sworn to secrecy. ""They had security clearances and access to negotiating information,"" Schwab said. ""They could meet with us in D.C. or come to Geneva or elsewhere, when negotiations were hot. Other labor union leaders, consumer group representatives, environmental groups and civil society representatives are there. So are industry, agricultural and service sector experts. Negotiators turn to all of these committees, along with members of Congress who represent them, and key Republican or Democratic staffers with security clearance and access to classified negotiating information and status reports, to get input and advice before and during negotiations."" Union involvement in trade negotiations is nothing new. Lee, the AFL-CIO’s lead trade adviser, spoke about the process under President Barack Obama when she told CNN in 2015, ""I've worked with the Clinton administration and I've worked with the Bush administration. And this administration is more secretive."" In 2014, Obama tapped several union representatives to serve on the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, including Leo W. Gerard, member of the AFL-CIO’s Executive Committee, Joseph T. Hansen, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, and James P. Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (and the late Jimmy Hoffa’s son). When we checked with Strickland’s campaign, spokesman David Bergstein sent us this issues statement from the AFL-CIO, which articulates the union’s frustration with their level of influence and access in trade agreements. Our ruling Strickland told a union hall’s audience, ""We need to stop politicians and special interests from negotiating trade deals in secret. ... To my knowledge they’ve never invited the leaders of the AFL-CIO or steelworkers or the mine workers to come in and sit down in these meetings."" He was correct that trade deals are negotiated in secret. However, when Strickland says that union leaders aren’t invited to have a say in these talks, he’s wrong. Union representatives are part of the advisory committees that have access to negotiators and politicians as these deals are worked out. They have similar access to the corporate leaders and business interests. How much of a difference they’re able to make -- that’s a whole other fact-check. We rate this statement Half True.","[('Interview, Ambassador Susan Schwab, University of Maryland professor, May 13, 2016', 'https://ballotpedia.org/The_Trans-Pacific_Partnership_trade_deal:_An_overview'), ('Web article, ""The Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal: an overview,"" Ballotpedia.com, May 2, 2016', 'No link'), ('Article, ""Senate approves fast-track, sending trade bill to White House,"" The Hill, June 24, 2015', 'http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/246035-senate-approves-fast-track-sending-trade-bill-to-white-house'), ('Fact-check, ""Chain email says major Pacific trade deal could be taken up in Senate without committee review or debate,"" PolitiFact, Nov. 29, 2013 ', 'No link'), ('Article, ""How secretive is the Trans-Pacific Partnership?""

Elizabeth Warren gets better of Donald Trump on his stance on abolishing federal minimum wage
","The question of whether -- or how much -- to raise the minimum wage has been a divisive issue during the Democratic presidential primary. But it has also caused frictions between Republicans and Democrats. A case in point is a recent Twitter exchange between presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of the progressive wing of her party. On May 11, Warren tweeted this: ""You care so much about struggling American workers, @realDonaldTrump, that you want to abolish the federal minimum wage?"" Later that day, Trump tweeted back: ""Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See media—asking for increase!"" Did Trump say he wants to abolish the federal minimum wage? To be honest, Trump's comments are so all over the map that it's hard to definitively say. That said, it's also wrong of Trump to accuse Warren of lying.  First, some background. There’s a federal minimum wage -- currently $7.25 an hour -- that sets an absolute wage floor for the country as a whole. Beyond that, though, states can set their own minimum wages higher than the national level, and many of them have. (This map shows the current state-by-state breakdown.) In the meantime, localities can also set minimum wage levels higher than that of their state. The clearest example of Trump seeming to propose abolishing the federal minimum wage came in the May 8, 2016, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, when host Chuck Todd prodded Trump on his minimum wage views. Here’s the relevant exchange: Todd: ""Should the federal government set a floor, and then you let the states--"" Trump: ""No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck. So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they're out there. They're working. It is a very low number. You know, with what's happened to the economy, with what's happened to the cost. I mean, it's just -- I don't know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say let the states decide."" By answering no, we think many people would assume Trump does not want a minimum wage set by the federal government. That's what Warren certainly thought. We asked the Trump campaign whether he had simply misspoken in the heat of the interview and meant to say he supported keeping a $7.25 wage nationally and letting states set their own wage floor higher. But we didn’t hear back. Trump's other recent comments about the minimum wage articulate no clear position. • In an interview with MSNBC in August 2015, Trump said, ""Having a low minimum wage is not a bad thing for this country."" • During the Republican debate in Milwaukee in November 2015, Trump said wages are ""too high"" and, when asked whether he would raise the minimum wage, said, ""I would not do it."" • In December 2015, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders tweeted, ""Donald Trump does not want to raise the minimum wage. In fact, he has said that he thinks wages in America are too high."" Trump tweeted back, ""[email protected] blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime, said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!"" • On ABC’s This Week on May 8, 2016, host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump, ""Minimum wage -- all through the primaries, you were against an increase. Now you're saying you're looking at it. So what's your bottom line on this?"" Trump responded, ""Well, I am looking at it and I haven't decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more."" When Stephanopoulos asked whether that’s a change, Trump answered, ""Well, sure it's a change. I'm allowed to change. You need flexibility."" • In the May 8 Meet the Press interview, Trump said, ""I have seen what's going on. And I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude. But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide."" • And as we noted earlier, Trump tweeted to Warren that he’s ""asking for (an) increase."" Our ruling Trump said, ""Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage."" Yet when Trump was asked if he would have a federal floor with states going higher if they wish,Trump said, ""No."" While Trump's other statements can leave readers with a different impression, there is certainly no evidence Warren lied. She simply used Trump's own words. We rate this statement Mostly False.","[('Donald Trump, tweet, May 11, 2016', 'https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/730493295550468096'), ('Elizabeth Warren, tweet, May 11, 2016', 'No link'), ('Meet the Press, transcript, May 8, 2016', 'https://twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/730456302296641537?ref_src=twsrc^tfw'), ('This Week, transcript, May 8, 2016', 'No link'), ('Reuters, ""Trump: \'Having a low minimum wage is not a bad thing,’ "" Aug. 20, 2015', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-may-8-2016-n570111'), ('Time, Republican debate transcript, Nov. 11, 2015', 'No link'), ('Bernie Sanders, tweet, Dec. 27, 2015', 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-donald-trump/story?id=38951757'), ('Donald Trump, tweet, Dec. 27, 2015', 'No link'), ('U.S. Department of Labor, ""Minimum Wage Laws in the States - January 1, 2016,"" accessed May 18, 2016', 'http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-having-a-low-minimum-wage-is-not-a-bad-thing-2015-8'), ('People For the American Way, ""Trump Campaign Manager Open To Eliminating Federal Minimum Wage,"" May 12, 2016', 'No link'), ('Mother Jones, ""BinC Watch: Donald Trump Has Now Changed His Mind on the Minimum Wage Three Times In Three Days,"" May 11, 2016', 'https://time.com/4107636/transcript-read-the-full-text-of-the-fourth-republican-debate-in-milwaukee/'), ('Email interview with Lacey Rose, spokeswoman for Elizabeth Warren, May 18, 2016', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2016/may/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-elizabeth-warren-lied-saying-he/

Bernie Sanders links Puerto Rico's debt crisis to Wall Street greed
","Bernie Sanders condemned Wall Street for creating and now profiting off Puerto Rico’s debt crisis during a campaign stop on the island. Puerto Rico is currently $72 billion in debt and, in the words of its governor, in ""a death spiral."" Unlike other states and cities, it cannot legally declare bankruptcy. So Sanders called for the Federal Reserve to help the U.S. territory out, just as it bailed out the financial sector responsible for imperilling 3.5 million Puerto Ricans in the first place.   ""I think all of us understand and your government understands that Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt is unsustainable and it is unpayable,"" Sanders said May 16 at a town hall in San Juan. ""And the reason why it is unsustainable has everything to do with the greed of Wall Street vulture funds."" So is Wall Street to blame for the island’s economic woes? Sanders has a point that hedge funds and banks are certainly exacerbating the situation and, in some cases, attempting to block a solution. However, experts told us and the research shows that Puerto Rico has been accumulating debt long before Wall Street got involved. Origins of the debt This $72 billion debt did not appear solely thanks to the maneuvers of Wall Street. Rather, it’s been building up for decades, resulting from a combination of U.S. policy, local mismanagement and economic decline. The local government has essentially maxed out a very special credit card given to it and other U.S. territories. When the island became a commonwealth in 1917, Congress also made bonds issued by the Puerto Rican government ""triple tax-exempt"" (meaning they can’t be taxed at the federal, state or local level) and thus very attractive to investors. For decades, this allowed the government to overspend, in part out of necessity and in part out of sheer irresponsibility. Puerto Rico has had to pick up a disportionate chunk of the tab for federal social programs. More than 60 percent of its residents receive Medicare or Medicaid, but federal funding is considerably lower than the states. (For example, $3 billion for Oklahoma’s Medicaid program and $3.6 billion for Mississippi’s compared to $373 million for the island, a fraction of its $2.9 billion in expenses.) Disparities in funding aside, the local government has also made some poor management and spending decisions. Inefficient public utilities have been running up the tab since the 1940s and now account for the largest portion of Puerto Rico’s debt ($20 billion). Meanwhile, the state-run power authority continues to dole out free electricity. Similarly, public employees enjoy ""lavish pension benefits"" like holiday bonuses and loans for international travel but the pensions remain severely underfunded ($1.9 billion in assets versus $45.5 billion in liabilities). Now add in changes in federal policy, economic depression and population decline and you’ve got a recipe for even less revenue and total debt unsustainability. For decades, U.S. businesses operating in Puerto Rico received significant tax breaks, an economic boon for the island. But that all ended in 1996, when President Bill Clinton signed legislation phasing out the incentives over 10 years. By 2006, Puerto Rico was already $43 billion in debt and fell into a recession that, compounded by the global financial crisis, continues to this day. Marc Joffe, the principal consultant at Public Sector Credit Solutions, tracked Puerto Rico’s debt  from 1910 to 2015. Here’s a chart we made using his data:  Wall Street’s role The island was already knee-deep in debt by the time the financial industry got involved, but Wall Street is certainly profiting off of the situation. According to Sanders in his San Juan address and his campaign, hedge funds now hold about 50 percent of Puerto Rico’s debt. This is the high end of estimates we found, which range from 20 percent to 50 percent. But this is a relatively recent development. Prior to 2014, most of Puerto Rico’s bonds were owned by traditional mutual funds and retail investors, according to Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who previously worked in the Obama administration's Treasury Department. Morningstar, the research investment firm, estimated that some 180 mutual funds had Puerto Rican bonds in their portfolios in 2013. In 2014, multiple credit ratings agencies downgraded Puerto Rico’s bonds to junk status. Because of the high risk associated with this low grade, most traditional investors were unable or unwilling to invest. Enter Wall Street. Hedge funds and other non-traditional buyers ""eyeing fat yields and possible trading gains"" purchased $3.5 billion worth of junk bonds at a tax-free interest rate of just under 9 percent (the high rate reflecting the high risk). As Puerto Rico’s debt had already topped $70 billion in 2013, $3.5 billion wouldn’t have made much of a difference. ""The combination of Puerto Rico’s decision (to sell more bonds) and the availability of Wall Street financing helped Puerto Rico dig itself into a bigger hole,"" said Setser. In fact, if the hedge funds hadn’t purchased these bonds, which were after all issued to pay off old debt, ""the crisis would have come a little earlier since the level of debt was already unsustainable,"" said Joffe of Public Sector Credit Solutions. That being said, Wall Street should be held accountable for its opportunism as some hedge funds and banks have certainly chosen to take advantage of the situation, said Rafael Fantauzzi of the National Puerto Rican Coalition. Since 2014, hedge funds have been buying up bonds on the cheap in the secondary market (those previously owned by traditional investors). Sanders’ campaign provided PolitiFact an example of bonds bought for 29 cents on the dollar yielding an interest of 34 percent. Bloomberg has reported yields ranging from under 10 percent to as high as 80 percent. Sanders in his San Juan speech and his campaign also noted that banks like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and UBS have received hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to manage the island’s bond sales. The exact figure, according to the Wall Street Journal, is $1.4 billion for $61 billion worth of bond sales since 2006. That’s the equivalent of a service charge of 2.3 percent, double the average rate for municipal bond sales but quadruple the rate for corporate bond sales. Exacerbating the situation The most damning evidence for ""the greed of vulture funds"" is Wall Street’s efforts to prevent Puerto Rico from digging itself out of the hole. As we’ve previously reported, Puerto Rico is legally unable to declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy. But there is currently legislation in motion to allow the island to restructure the debt. The Sanders campaign forwarded us a New York Times report of a letter representatives of BlueMountain, a hedge fund that holds Puerto Rican bonds, sent to Republican staff members urging against allowing debt restructuring. The Center for Individual Freedom, a dark money group, has also spent $2 million on issue ads against debt relief efforts in Congress, supporting the hedge funds’ position. ""That’s very concerning that financial interests, specially these so-called ‘vulture funds,’ are disrupting the political process and preventing Puerto Rico having a smoother landing in this situation they got themselves into,"" said Joffe, adding that that’s what they did in Argentina as well. In lieu of debt restructuring, Wall Street recommends cutting spending. A report commissioned by 34 hedge funds advises Puerto Rico to raise taxes, lay off teachers, close schools, and cut wages and worker benefits, Medicaid, and welfare. (About 45.4 percent of Puerto Ricans live below the poverty line and the commonwealth already closed 150 schools in the last five years and increased its sales tax.) So while the hedge funds and banks ""have played a relatively modest role in creating the need for a comprehensive debt solution,"" said Setser, they are ""playing a more important role in hindering a bipartisan solution."" Our ruling Sanders said, ""Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt is unsustainable and it is unpayable. And the reason why it is unsustainable has everything to do with the greed of Wall Street vulture funds."" Puerto Rico’s debt was already unsustainable by the time Wall Street hedge funds and banks began playing a role as a result of decades of local mismanagement, U.S. policy and economic misfortune. But Sanders has a point that the financial sector has taken advantage of and is excerbating the situation.
